1jrfk7u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrfk7u,Need office building ideas,"Hi Everyone,

So for some reason I am obsessed with making the best office building, like ever lol. I previously made a counseling center on the gallery (it has been download many times). This time I want to make an office building and I have done some of it so far.

The lower basement is the rec center (available only to building leases and employees, in theory).

The upper basement is set up for a call center with cubicles and office spaces

The ground floor is main lobby and a coffee shop

The second floor is a random set of offices (which I think would be suitable probably for counseling or medical offices)- there is a waiting room/reception area.

But the third and 4th floors- nothing. I know I want the top floor (4th) to be executive penthouse type office suites. The third floor I am considering adding an employee daycare, a small cafeteria, and some additional run of the mill offices.

here are pics of what I have so far. Thank You :)

1jrfiad,https://youtu.be/nhB9POgtYZ0?si=NZ47O8_MOta_-kDW,Aurvana Ace Mimi Review,"I had lots of positive feedback on my review of the Zen Hybrid Pro SXFI last year, so here's another from me, this time it's the Aurvana Ace Mimi.

*Methodology Summary: All my reviews include binaural sound and ANC samples recorded in real-world environments, as well as frequency response measurements. For this review, I tested ANC effectiveness in a busy coffee shop with direct comparisons to similarly priced competitors, and evaluated call quality across various indoor and outdoor scenarios.*

**INTRO**

Earlier this year, I reviewed the Creative Aurvana Ace 2, one of the first mainstream TWS to feature solid-state XMEMS driver technology, and a release that showcased both Creative's strengths and weaknesses in equal measure. Whilst the xMEMS implementation demonstrated clear advantages, with snappy transients and a treble that was both detailed and well-sculptured, the dynamic driver selection wasn't the most cohesive, and the ANC and overall stability of the device (mostly down to the buggy Qualcomm chipset deployed) weren't quite up to the job, at least in a set with a retail price of over £100.  
  
Creative has now followed up with the Aurvana Ace Mimi – not a direct successor (hence not being called Ace 3), more a *variation on a theme* with some notable differences. The headline feature is the integration of Mimi sound personalization technology, which provides a hearing test to customize audio based on your specific hearing capabilities. Mimi are the world leaders in this space, with Nothing, Beyerdynamic, Focal and many other partners scrambling to adopt their developments into their value propositions, but for this to be a real success Creative would have to 'right a few wrongs' - at the very least provide a stable operating environment off the bat. 

Does the Aurvana Ace Mimi meet expectations? Well, kinda - read on for my thoughts on why you may or may not consider this a viable next purchase option.  


**Pros:** 

* xMEMS drivers deliver clear benefits to the mids and treble transients 
* Mimi sound personalization based on hearing test works well 
* Much improved LC3 codec implementation & overall stability 
* Extremely low latency (\~60ms, near zero with gaming mode) 
* Above-average call quality in various environments 
* Comfortable shallow insertion design 
* Improved battery life over predecessor 
* Some touch control customization 
* Comprehensive EQ options (±9dB 10-band) 
* IPX5 water and sweat resistance 
* Wireless charging support 
* Clean transparency mode with acceptably low occlusion (for me, at least)

**Cons:** 

* Bass lacks punch and definition, which contrasts against the mid and treble precision 
* Mimi personalization profile stored in app, not on earbuds 
* Mediocre ANC performance (weaker than predecessor) 
* No wear detection sensors 
* No quick charge feature 
* Slow charging time (\~60 minutes for buds)
* No device list for multipoint in app 
* Average overall battery life (4h50m with ANC) 
* Slightly unimaginative design and not enough of a deviation from predecessor

**Design, Fit and Comfort**

The Mimi (as we will refer to them going forward) have adopted the same shell as the Ace 2, which is good and bad news depending on how highly you rated that design. I found them to be quite comfortable, thanks to the shallow fit and smaller footprint to the oval nozzle, that sits somewhere between the Earfun Air Pro 4 and Realme Buds Air 6 Pro in terms of size and footprint.

While the build quality isn't exceptional, and truth be told a bit disappointing compared to others at a similar price from the likes of Huawei and OnePlus, the comfort level is sufficient, even good, for daily use, and the improved ear tip material brings better stability than the previous model.

The earbuds maintained their position reliably during my exercise testing, passing the 100 jumping jacks test with no issues. The IPX5 water and sweat resistance rating makes them suitable for workouts, though without proper waterproofing, I wouldn't recommend them for swimming or extremely heavy rain. I have seen some reviews complaining about their performance in windy conditions, but I suspect this is more down to fit and seal than anything Creative have done in terms of the design. I'm in the UK, not Cape Verde, and whilst we get wind from time to time, it isn't enough to really notice the extremities in performance - the Mimi seemed to be as good (and bad) as everyone else.

The case design is reasonably portable with a decent finish, though the hinge mechanism is problematic, sometimes slamming shut unexpectedly. Creative has upgraded the accessories, including a drawstring bag, which I've used a grand total of zero times since!

Touch controls on the Ace Mimi work OK, but can at times be a source of frustration. You have to hit them at the right point to ensure you don't fail to register - not always easy given the 'shoulder-style' indent at the top of the stem - and the default control system isn't particularly intuitive. They do offer fairly good customization through the app, although there are limitations. The ""Custom Buttons"" section allows you to configure double tap, triple tap, and long tap gestures. Most functions are available for double and triple taps (except volume control), while long press is limited to volume adjustment or no function at all. Unfortunately, single touch, like Edifier, is not an option, which reduces accidental touches but adds a layer of restriction some users might find annoying.

**ANC & Transparency**  
  
The active noise cancellation is somewhat disappointing, actually performing slightly worse than the Ace 2 and falling behind similarly priced competitors. The binaural testing revealed relatively weak performance, particularly with mid-range frequencies and voices, with an average noise reduction of around 21dB, compared to 28dB on the Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4. Lower-frequency sounds are handled OK for the most part, but for Creative to neglect to make improvements here when practically every review on the Ace 2 criticized its ANC calls into question why Creative even bothered to release this model, especially with the FCC approvals in progress for the Ace 3.  
  
On the positive side, transparency mode is cleaner than the previous model with minimal occlusion effect when speaking. Environmental sounds come through clearly, making conversations easy to follow without removing the earbuds. It's again behind the likes of Huawei and OnePlus, but it's a clear improvement over the Ace 2.

**Sound**

The dual driver configuration pairs an XMEMS solid-state driver handling mids and treble with a 10mm dynamic driver for bass. This results in excellent performance in the mid and high frequencies, where the XMEMS technology shines with fast transients, detailed instrument separation, and natural-sounding yet highly polished treble extension that combines air and precision without hitting hitting the point of fatigue. If you listen to tracks heavy on percussion, you'll notice that the trebles aren't perfect - there's a slight scratchiness at higher volumes, but overall it's a big improvement from single DD's or the unnatural taste of balanced armatures.

The bass response, while slightly improved over the Ace 2 with reduced mid-bass bloat, still lacks the punch and definition to match the precision of the mids and highs. Bass notes tend to linger a bit longer than ideal, creating a slight disconnect between the tight, articulate upper frequencies and the softer, less defined low end. It sounds like Creative simply adjusted the variables to improve the tuning, rather than use a different dynamic driver, so whilst the end result is slightly-more cohesive than the Ace 2, it still isn't ideal.  
  
In the sub-£150 category, though, the Mimi still rank well in my audio league table, thanks to a sensible tuning and outstanding level of customisation, both hearing and preference-based, but it's still slightly disappointing that the improvement over the Ace 2 is incremental rather than transformative. A different dynamic driver implementation could have elevated the overall performance further, so they've left us longing for more here really, which is a shame.

The Mimi personalization and EQ (both custom and preset-based) is where the Mimi really stand out from the crowd, with both accessible through the Creative app. The Mimi process involves a 4-minute hearing test (best done in a quiet environment) where you hold your finger on a circle and release when you can no longer hear the frequency being played. After completion, it generates a profile for each ear with a visualization of your hearing abilities across frequencies. The resulting profile creates a sound signature compensating for your specific hearing deficiencies, with a slider to adjust the intensity and three presets for further customization. Importantly, **this isn't based on tonal preference but on hearing capability,** so you may still want to use the EQ for personal taste adjustments.  
  
For me, it made a tangible difference to the listening experience. For those with high-frequency hearing loss (like myself, from years of playing at clubs and festivals), the combination of the xMEMS plus Mimi is a winner - with my specific hearing profile, it significantly enhanced detail retrieval in the upper frequencies without causing fatigue, providing a better foundation for further EQ adjustments. A notable limitation is that the Mimi profile is stored in the app rather than on the earbuds themselves, meaning the personalization doesn't work when connected to devices without the Creative app – a limitation Creative doesn't mention in their marketing.

On the hearing preference side, the app's 10-band custom EQ is well implemented with strategically placed frequency points and a generous ±9dB adjustment range. Creative includes numerous music and gaming presets with helpful visual representations of how each preset modifies the frequency response that you can then use a baseline to fine-tune further. Overall, you get a very helpful level of control over the sound that is thoroughly well-implemented.  
  
**Call Quality**  
  
The Mimi, like the Ace 2 before them, deliver fairly good call performance across various environments, giving you an acceptable balance of noise reduction and voice tone and weight. The noise reduction algorithm works consistently in both indoor and outdoor settings, though voice clarity isn't optimal, meaning your voice can sound authoritative but slightly muffled, even in quiet conditions. Despite this minor issue, calls remain intelligible in all tested scenarios, making the earbuds fairly reliable for communication in controlled environments.  
  
**Codecs & Connectivity**  
  
Unlike the Ace 2, the Mimi doesn't use a Qualcomm chipset, so it lacks aptX-Lossless support, maxing out at LDAC instead. Whilst spec-sheet nerds might take umbrage here, the real-life difference is negligible - even separating LDAC and AAC in a blind test is difficult, so distinguishing between two hi-res codecs is an absolute non-issue. For Creative, the number of users with phones that support LDAC is much higher than the aptX family, which will appeal to those who overblow the importance of bitrate.  
  
My experience using LC3 was far better this time however - a stark contrast from the buggy and frustrating time I had with the Ace 2, which often wouldn't even register in the app and had weird side issues like an abnormally-low mic volume, disconnections when the mic wasn't in use (like with DuoLingo, between rounds) and the inability to control the volume your phone (only the buds). As I said at the time, this appeared to be a Qualcomm issue, since I noticed the same problems with other buds with the same chipset, but regardless, Creative managed something fairly stable first time around this time, as opposed to ten firmware updates later.  
  
This stability comes with an unexpected benefit: extremely low latency, measuring around 60ms even without gaming mode activated. With gaming mode engaged, latency becomes virtually imperceptible, and when you combine this with the litany of gaming presets, you get a pretty handy set for PubG mobile addicts.  
  
Multipoint connectivity also feels more reliable than on the Ace 2, though the app still lacks a device list for managing connections, and the Mimi still lack a few features, like wear detection and a 'find my buds' mode.  
  
**Battery Life**  
  
Battery performance shows improvement over the Ace 2, offering approximately 4 hours and 50 minutes with ANC enabled – about 45 minutes more than its predecessor. It's hardly market-leading stuff, but it's about what we come to expect these days. The problem, though, is that unlike many of its competitors, who offer a similar single use performance but then give you a couple of hours boost from their 'quick-charge' feature, the Mimi neither support this nor a reduced charge time, with the industry-standard 60 minutes to fully charge the buds (and even longer for the case) meaning you're possibly going to be without them for a period during the working day - not ideal. The case does support wireless charging, which is always a welcome feature, although at the cost of time, which may already be at a premium. You get three additional charge cycles with the case.  
  
**Summary**  
  
The Mimi represents an interesting sidestep rather than an upgrade from the Ace 2. Its greatest strengths lie in the implementation of the Mimi sound personalization technology and the improved stability of both codec performance and, to a degree, the app and multipoint, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not really enough, with many of the Ace 2's shortcomings still in play.  
  
The XMEMS driver technology continues to impress with exceptional mid and high-frequency performance, though the bass response still leaves room for improvement that could, and probably should, have been remedied with an alternative dynamic driver. The personalization features are genuinely useful, especially for those with specific hearing characteristics, though the limitation of profiles being stored in the app rather than on the earbuds is disappointing.  
  
Despite a far more stable LC3 implementation and better battery life bringing them close to their competitors, ANC performance and charging speed remain mediocre, and they lack many 'bread-and-butter' features that we expect to see at this price - notably quick charge, wear detection and spatial audio.  
  
Whilst I enjoy using the Mimi, and do rate them as a solid (although slightly-overpriced) option (especially for those with specific hearing needs). This feels like a slightly lazy and slightly unimaginative release. I love that Creative have pioneered the xMEMS tech and tried to push the industry forward, embracing innovation faster than many of the more recognisable names in TWS, but we have all become a bit fatigued from releases that only offer incremental improvements, and sadly, for many this will have the feeling of one of those releases. If you loved the Ace 2 but hated the stability issues, though, this might be an interim option while we wait with baited breath for the Ace 3.

I have managed to grab the audio track for a few of these, most of them in the 2-3 hour range, so the music does loop quite a number of times within that track. Cutting out a single loop is _NOT_ what I want to do - I just want to start and end the track at the first and last loop transition that I managed to save.

The objective of this is to drop it onto an older classic iPod (30-pin) for use around the house where we have docking players set up. That way, she can take the iPod with her, set it to play a random collection of tracks within that group, and she would get a good 12hrs of smooth jazz music with _decent_ transitions between the tracks - it wouldn’t abruptly cut off in the middle of one jazz loop to abruptly start in the middle of another one when the tracks changed.

So I am curious if there is any software that can analyze a track of music and identify where, within that track, one loop ends and another loop starts.

# Hydro flask vs. Stanley (2025): Which Water Bottle Reigns Supreme? - Expert Review!

Choosing the perfect water bottle might seem trivial, but for outdoor enthusiasts, students, office workers, eco-conscious consumers, and even those looking for practical gifts, it's a decision that impacts daily life. In the battle of hydration titans, the **Hydro Flask vs.Stanley** debate continues to rage on. Both brands offer durable, insulated solutions for keeping drinks cold or hot for extended periods, but which one truly reigns supreme in 2025? This expert review dives deep into the features, benefits, and drawbacks of each, providing actionable insights so you can confidently choose the best reusable **water bottle** for your needs.

## Understanding the hype: Why Hydro Flask and Stanley?

before we delve into a head-to-head **hydro flask vs stanley comparison**, let's briefly outline why these two brands have become synonymous with quality hydration. Both **hydro flask** and **stanley** bottles utilize **vacuum insulated** **stainless steel water bottle** construction, a technology renowned for its ability to maintain temperature for hours. This insulation is crucial whether you're trekking up a mountain, attending a lecture, or navigating a busy workday. Beyond insulation, both brands offer a commitment to sustainability, promoting the use of **reusable** bottles to reduce reliance on disposable plastic.

## Durability and Build Quality: Can They Withstand the Test?

When it comes to **hydro flask durability** and **stanley durability**, both brands have built impressive reputations. hydro Flask's powder coating, while offering a vibrant range of **hydro flask colors**, can be susceptible to scratches and dents with heavy use. Stanley,conversely,often features a more robust exterior,better equipped to handle the rigors of outdoor adventures.

For **outdoor gear**, where durability is paramount, the Stanley's rugged build might offer a slight advantage. hikers, campers, and backpackers frequently enough prioritize resilience over aesthetics. Consider your typical use case: If your bottle is primarily for commuting and desk use, the Hydro Flask might suffice. However, for serious outdoor activities, Stanley's more robust construction could be the better choice.

## Insulation Performance: keeping Drinks Cold (or Hot!)

The core function of these bottles is insulation. Both excel, but subtle differences exist. Many sources report similar insulation capabilities, where Stanley is consistently better at temperature retention. For those who need their **hot drinks** to stay hot for extended periods (think long commutes or chilly camping mornings), Stanley might edge out Hydro Flask. Both are great for keeping cold drinks cold, perfect for **gym**, **fitness**, or simply staying **hydrated** throughout the day. Choosing the better option really depends on the specific needs of a cold or hot drink user.

If you are looking for the **best water bottle for hiking**, **best water bottle for camping**, or **best water bottle for travel**, strongly consider how long you need to keep water cold or hot.

## Design and Features: Aesthetics and Functionality

**Hydro Flask** boasts a sleek, minimalist design and a wide array of **hydro flask colors** to choose from. Their **wide mouth** bottles are popular for adding ice and easy cleaning. Stanley often sports a more classic, utilitarian aesthetic. Some Stanley models feature innovative designs, such as the Quencher series with a handle and straw, catering to a specific user preference.

The choice between a **wide mouth** and **narrow mouth** bottle is a matter of personal preference. Wide mouths are easier for filling and cleaning but can be trickier to drink from without spilling. Narrow mouths offer a more controlled flow but might be less convenient for adding ice cubes.

The addition of a **carry handle** is a significant factor for many. Stanley's newer designs frequently enough incorporate a handle, making them easier to carry around, especially for **commuting** or navigating a busy campus.

## Sizes and Options: Finding the Perfect Fit

Both hydro Flask and Stanley offer a range of **hydro flask sizes** and **stanley sizes** to suit different needs. From smaller bottles perfect for everyday carry to larger options ideal for extended hikes, there's a size for everyone. Consider how much water you typically consume in a day and choose a size that aligns with your **hydration** goals.## Leak-Proof Performance: Avoiding Spills and Messes

A **leak-proof** design is essential, especially for students carrying bottles in backpacks or office workers placing them on desks.Both brands generally perform well in this area,but it's essential to ensure the lid is properly sealed. While both brands tout leak-resistance, user reviews sometimes report occasional leaks, often due to lid wear or improper closure.

## Price and Value: Getting the Most for Your Money

The **hydro flask price** and **stanley price** are generally comparable, but prices can vary depending on the size, features, and retailer. Stanley often provides more value for price considering the similar quality build. Consider your budget and compare prices across different retailers before making a purchase. Also look at the warranty offered, since the **stanley warranty** is a factor to consider.

## Cleaning and Maintenance: Keeping Your Bottle Fresh

Proper cleaning is crucial to prevent bacteria growth and maintain the longevity of your bottle. Both hydro Flask and Stanley are relatively easy to clean, although Stanley's Quencher, with its multiple parts, requires a bit more attention. Many models are **dishwasher safe**, but always check the manufacturer's instructions to avoid damaging the powder coating or insulation. The **hydro flask vs stanley cleaning** comparison is generally a wash (pun intended), as both are stainless steel. Stanley, however, has more parts than the Hydro Flask water bottle, meaning there are more spots for debris and mold to possibly hide.

## Sustainability and Environmental Impact: Choosing the Eco-Kind Option

Both Hydro Flask and Stanley promote the use of **reusable** bottles as a way to reduce reliance on disposable plastic. Choosing either brand is a step towards a more **eco-friendly** lifestyle.Look for bottles labeled as **BPA free** to ensure they are made with safe materials. The most sustainable practice is to choose a bottle that you will use for a long time, regardless of the brand.

Consider brands like Owala,Yeti,and Klean Kanteen as viable options. These brands often offer unique designs and price points that might better suit your needs and budget.

**for Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Durability and insulation are key. Stanley's rugged construction and excellent heat retention make it a strong contender for **best water bottle for hiking** and **best water bottle for camping**.**For Students:** Affordability, durability, and ease of carrying are important. Both Hydro Flask and Stanley offer suitable options, but consider Stanley for better value or Owala for unique design. Look for a bottle that's **easy to carry** and **leak-proof** for use on campus.

**For Office Workers/Professionals:** Style and functionality matter. Both Hydro Flask and Stanley offer sleek and professional-looking options.Consider a Stanley Quencher for its handle and straw or a Hydro Flask for its minimalist aesthetic.

At dinner, I serve the whole family the same meal at the dinner table, and there are very clear boundaries. He may try momentarily to ask for ""something else"" but he knows it's gonna be a no and (usually) eats relatively well, stays calm etc. 

At breakfast and lunch, the boundaries are nonexistent. I know this is my fault. I don't eat the same thing as him. He eats in his tower while I'm prepping his lunch, getting him dressed, trying to feed myself, feed the dogs, make coffee, keep him entertained with Yoto or books etc. It's chaos. 

He demands several different things to eat, all carbs, has maybe a bite then demands something else. I cave because I'm just too frazzled and I'm desperate to keep him in his tower since I can't hold him while juggling all the other morning tasks. But if I cut his muffin wrong, or give him the wrong size cereal bowl, he'll throw a tantrum. The constant demands of ""I WANT SOMETHING ELSE"" and ""MAMA UP!"" are driving me crazy. The food waste is driving me crazy. His penchant to throw hard objects across the room is driving me crazy. I also have a baby on the way.

1jrf816,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jrf816/ive_been_lying_about_having_an_allergy_so_that/,I've been lying about having an allergy so that people stop asking me to try foods I don't like.,"Ever since I can remember, I've always found certain foods absolutely disgusting and overbearing to my senses. Tomatoes, garlic, onion, types of cheeses and mint. The worst one for me however is meat. Not to be dramatic, but the smell of cooking meat alone is on the same level of disgusting as smelling feces or roadkill for me. Unfortunately, my family comes from a culture where meat is a major part of our traditional diet. You usually eat and pull it apart with your bare hands, without utensils. While I hate to speak disrespectfully of our customs, it is an absolute nightmare to me. The smell, the sound, the touch and the taste make me sick. My parents tried everything to find a way to get me to eat it, but every meal was difficult for me and I would often end up throwing up or going to bed hungry if I didn't have rice, noodles or buckwheat to fill up on. By the time I was a teenager I was so underweight that I looked much younger than I was. I often ended up getting in trouble with teachers because they thought I was breaking school rules by hanging out in the areas restricted to older students. 

The worst part was that the adults in my life seemed to not understand my disgust, they thought I was influenced by vegetarian ideology or diet trends rather than simple dislike. Others thought that surely I must lack discipline to be such a picky eater, and that I should train myself into liking it. I was perfectly able to train myself into liking black coffee, spicy foods, and certain vegetables. But the more I try it, the worse meat dishes taste to me. Ironically, vegans and vegetarians are always the kindest and most understanding people when it comes to my food problems, and have helped me find alternative protein sources to battle my malnutrition. Throughout my teen years I've been pressured or tricked into eating meat several times. There would always be that one person who would insist they could prepare it in a way I could stomach, then get offended when I couldn't. A few times I was told something didn't have meat in it only to bite into it and clearly taste it. I don't understand what's so hard to grasp about ""I tried it and I didn't like it.""

Eventually I got fed up and decided to simply say I had a meat allergy. If someone offered me something with meat, I would reply with ""Oh, I'm sorry, I would love to try this, but unfortunately I have an allergy."" Suddenly noone would argue with me anymore, they would just move on because nobody wanted to be responsible for me getting physically sick. Even my family started believing me, since they finally got an acceptable explanation for why I would always get sick or throw up after eating meat. Vegetarianism has since gotten much more accepted where I live, to the point that most places now offer vegetarian options with beans or tofu, which is perfect for me. I even got lucky with the fact that my wife is vegetarian by choice, so we can eat the same things. But years later I still stick to insisting on the allergy excuse, because I don't want to risk running into someone who just can't accept my preferences. I don't want to have people insisting I try their meat dish or try to sneak meat into my food in some attempt to convince me, I don't want to endure people telling me my parents should have been stricter on my diet or trying to argue the politics of veganism with me. The only person I would consider ever confessing to about my lie is my wife, because I know she would understand why I did it. Unfortunately, medical reasons seem to be the only socially accepted explanation for why I, a grown man, simply don't want to eat something that makes me miserable. I will always wonder why people take that so personally.",1,1743781889.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Baby: keeping a fun car to drive on the weekends is great. Take it to Cars and Coffees in the morning, and at night, tear up the Interstate (specifically I64 in VA 😎*). Only con is you don't drive it ""as much"" and you have a perfectly good car to drive.

So...what should I do?

P.s., posting because my GF was confused to why someone would need 2 cars, a beater and a ""fun/ practical"" car.

1jrf6mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1jrf6mo/the_12_biggest_lessons_i_learned_making_my_short/,The 12 Biggest Lessons I Learned Making My Short Film,"Honestly, making a movie is hard. Even a short one. I've seen a lot of people asking for advice here. I recently wrapped post-production on my biggest short film to date, so I'd like to share twelve big tips for first-time filmmakers (or, really, anyone who's making indie films right now). 

I'm by no means a film expert, but I did learn *a lot* on this project. I hope to keep learning on every film I make. That's how I'm going to grow as a filmmaker. If my experience can help anyone else, I'll be happy.

So **please** learn from my experience rather than making mistakes yourself. As someone with three older brothers, I can attest to the value of learning from others' mistakes.

# First, just a little bit of context for this project.

You wanna get to the lessons. I get it! Maybe you scrolled right past this (good for you). I think it's important to provide a little bit of context first.

I've done a few short film projects (a proof of concept, a sizzle reel), which you can read all about in [my first Exploring Filmmaking post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1j5zi58/my_journey_to_direct_a_feature_film/). But this was my first time creating a film as the screenwriter, director, and a producer. It was a major undertaking.

The project's called *Strangers* and we shot over four and a half days in October 2024 with a budget of about $50,000. It's a sci-fi thriller with elements of horror that revolves around two strangers trying to survive encounters with an alien creature. We've just wrapped post production (in April 2025), and I'm currently sending it out on the festival circuit. I'll be referring to it with examples throughout this post.

So, with that in mind, here are the twelve big things I learned as a filmmaker on this project, from pre-production to production to post-production.

[Actor Tristen MacLean celebrating on the set of Strangers.](https://preview.redd.it/s2v6exov8use1.jpg?width=6240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51cbc2a28b1b5eafce1ee910d0d1cb15b59850c5)

# 1. Spend longer on the screenplay than you think you need.

For this project, my goal was to [come to set with a script that I felt really solid about](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/strangers-is-heading-into-production). I am so, so glad I did. I ended up writing seven or eight drafts of the screenplay and had multiple people read it and provide notes along the way.

Here's why: the screenplay is the blueprint of the film. This is the plan. I'm a screenwriter, so I'm biased, but for me the script is everything. Because story is *everything* in cinema. Can you make a poor movie from a great script? Yeah, definitely. It happens. But can you make a great movie without a great script? I don't think so.

Make sure your script is ready to go before you start production. It helped tremendously while shooting. We ended up cutting a few minor things in the edit, but I'm glad that we shot those parts on the day because it informed the performances. Just make your script SHARP.

# 2. Have more team pre-production meetings.

I did a ton of prep for this project. I made an extensive [shot list](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/shot-list-template-free-download/) and met with the Director of Photography about it. I storyboarded the entire film by drawing over 160 storyboards myself. The alien creature was designed through an exhaustive process over several months with [the puppet team](https://www.puppetstuffcanada.ca/). I met with the Production Designer and Art Director multiple times and provided images and boards for inspiration. I'm a planner. I like to know what I'm doing when I come to set.

[Sample storyboard from Strangers.](https://preview.redd.it/3f1s7nv09use1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a6cdf90713acdd1a3b5df038afc1121f95f123)

However, something I found lacking was interdepartmental cohesion. All the department heads met once to hash things out during pre-production. We set up the meeting so people could ask questions, get the info they needed from each other, etc. This was super helpful, but I don't think it was enough.

When we got to loading in the set and the actual production, I realized there was still information missing. There were questions that hadn't been addressed. Costumes and makeup could have used more time together, for example, and that caused delays while prepping the actors. Art Department had a few surprises on the day from the main location. Little things are to be expected, but many of them were avoidable as well. Next time I'd make sure we have more of these full-team pre-production meetings.

Is this overkill for a short film? Maybe for some people. But I think the more work you do ahead of time with your team, the better you set yourself up for success during principal photography.

# 3. A script supervisor is definitely worth it.

""Get a script supervisor"" they said. ""It'll be fun,"" they said. And you know what? **They were right**.

Having a scripty on set was incredible. It wasn't in my original budget, but after talking to other filmmakers I made it work. I'm really glad I did. Our script supervisor was constantly spotting continuity errors that I missed and raising questions about the costume or the state of the set. It was super duper helpful.

And if that wasn't enough, in post-production I had this *amazing* script report! It had every take, my favourites from set circled, and department notes for each shot. It made the picture assembly process a breeze. If you haven't guessed, this was my first time working with a dedicated script supervisor, and I ain't goin' back now!

[Me \(left\) and our wonderful script supervisor Christy Marchuk.](https://preview.redd.it/gzxz5mhr9use1.jpg?width=6240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72ef497234541361d97022013d5709a095aa37c8)

# 4. Get a great on-set sound recordist.

Sound is so, so important to film. It's called *audio*visual media for a reason. I cannot stress this enough: make sure you get someone who can capture good-quality sound on set.

Accidents happen on set. Part way through our shoot, two of our lav mics stopped working, and we had to quickly find rentals to replace them. But we made it work because we had a sound recordist with the right gear and with a good plan.

Great sound from set will really make your post-production process shine. No one wants to watch a film with poor dialogue audio. That's a sure-fire way to make a low-quality film. If you have a limited budget, this role should be one of your top priorities. (Also a colourist, make sure you've got someone good there!)

# 5. Catering and craft services are so important.

Food makes a huge difference on your set. A HUGE difference.

For this project, I was paying decent rates for just about everyone on set (we had a few volunteers on some days), but whether you're paying people or not, invest in some good meals and craft services. If you don't tons of money, make food at home ahead of time (or get a producer to do it). Just make sure it's done.

When people first arrive in the morning, make sure there's coffee and/or tea and *something* for people to eat. We weren't providing a hot breakfast, but I always made sure the craft services table was ready to go at the top of the day.

For your meal, get good food. I mean healthy food. Food that will fuel your crew. Put money from your budget here, *especially* if you have volunteers. Try to avoid really heavy food like pizza (for example), because after lunch you'll likely see a slump in energy.

[Director of Photography Chase Gardiner. Look how happy he is because he's been fed well! \(He's also just a happy dude.\)](https://preview.redd.it/voa89uyt9use1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7034d3403b50df0962290b1323459da745a45e09)

""This is about filmmaking! Why should I care about the food?"" you may ask. Here's why. From a strictly practical point of view, cast and crew will work better when they're fed well and are drinking enough liquids. From an social point of view, people will feel better (which will also make their work better) and they'll probably want to work with you again. If you put care into the people you work with, they're more likely to put care into the work you're doing.

On that note, we also went a little above and beyond for an indie short film and paid for everyone's parking and transportation to and from set. Honestly, this was over our budget, but people really seemed to appreciate it. Especially, again, the volunteers. The last thing you'd want is for a volunteer crew member to donate their time to your project and then actually be out money because they had to pay $25 out of pocket for parking downtown. That would suck. Don't be sucky.

# 6. As the director, be flexible on the day.

As I mentioned, I'm a planner. I want to have everything thought out before going into production. Even so, things went wrong. They always do. Luckily, I did some research ahead of time (it turns out, anxiety *does* have its uses sometimes). I talked to some other filmmakers, asked questions here on Reddit. So part of my director prep was preparing for when things **don't** go according to plan. This proved *crucial* to getting through the week.

My shot-list had notes on which shots were ""needs"", which shots I was *hoping* to get, and which shots were just ""nice-to-have""s. This was key for when we were running behind schedule. On *Strangers*, we had a stunt coordinator for two days and three days with a giant puppet, so we were running behind *a lot*. But when we did, it was easy for me to look at the shot list and go: ""Let's drop Shot 3 and combine Shot 4 and 5."" *Bam!* Problem solved. But you can't plan ahead for everything.

When things aren't working, remember that filmmaking is a collaboration. Let your team members shine. Let them do their jobs. That what they're there for. That's why you hired them.

Here's a quick example. I'd storyboarded a dolly shot a certain way, but when we did it on location, it just *wasn't* working. After a few takes, the Director of Photography was like ""Hey, let me try something."" All he did was start the dolly move at the other end and reverse it, but suddenly the shot *sang*! I'm so glad I was flexible and willing to let go of my prep because that shot looks awesome in the film.

So be open. Try things on the day. Listen to your collaborators. Magic can happen.

# 7. Use the time you have and look for magic moments.

*Strangers* was an ambitious shoot. Even with 4.5 days to make a short, we worked hard and had to get a lot of footage. But, I actually felt good coming out of production (which doesn't always happen for me).

This is partially because I found time to get great footage when I could. On a short film, you probably won't have time for pickups (we didn't). But if a set up is taking a really long time or if you're waiting for actors, USE that time. Find time to grab inserts and extra little shots here and there.

Sometimes though, just let inspiration strike. My favourite shot in the whole film was something that we just discovered on the day. While waiting for a long set up, I starting playing around with the creature puppet and found something really cool to do with it. Something we couldn't have known without being in the space. We tried it out and it turned out **great**.

Use the time when the crew is busy to go over the scene with actors or try out blocking. Use the time when the actors are in the makeup chair to fix lighting or try a camera move with the crew.

Here's a weird example of just making it work. At the end of a long day, we ended up releasing an actor before we should have (they were union, so their overtime was starting to really rack up). But we'd missed a turnaround shot of the creature with our lead in it! *Ah!* Well, I just stepped in myself. So there's a hand reaching for the monster at one point in the final film that's actually mine. I just made it work.

# 8. Plan out striking the locations, for the love of god!

This one I feel a bit dumb about. Part of it was just lack of foresight. Most of *Strangers* was shot in one location, but the final day was in a second space elsewhere in town. We did have a plan for this company move, but after a *long* day of shooting on Thursday, we all had to load out the main space and many of us were there until nearly midnight. And *then* the next morning while a smaller crew set up the final location, we needed people in location 1 to finish unloading it, cleaning it up, etc. It just ended up being a lot more work than I anticipated.

[BTS of some set decoration from Strangers.](https://preview.redd.it/zmrj8v3z9use1.jpg?width=6240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fc8c75619952ce693e7f6ceceba71f3f9b69ad9)

Luckily, we had some amazing people step up to help. Our 2nd and 3rd AD led that effort because the Art Department needed to be with us in Location 2. (And we didn't have a dedicated locations team.) Next time, I'd plan this out in more detail and make sure we have the time and people necessary to properly wrap each location. Here's an easy tip: try to avoid doing a big location move *after* a long shooting day.

# 9. Gather behind-the-scenes pictures and videos from the team.

I got on-set photographers for two days and the pictures are already proving invaluable for our publicity efforts with the film. I mean, where do you think the photos in this post came from? And you can see some other great ones on [Solaris Productions' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/solarisfilmproductions/).

However, I also told the cast and crew they're free to take pictures and videos while on set. At the end of the shoot, I sent out a Google Drive and got everyone to dump whatever they wanted to share in there.

Not only did I get a lot of great assets to use for promotion, I also just loved seeing all the pictures. As the writer/director/producer I was *quite* busy on set, so this was a lovely way of seeing all the fun moments with the cast and crew that I missed.

We circulated guidelines on what people were allowed to post and when it's okay to take pictures on set. For examples, if actors are in really emotional scenes, I don't like phones to be out and in their faces. I find it distracting. So if you're going to try this one out, I recommend setting some ground rules.

# 10. Make a detailed post-production plan or get a post-production supervisor.

As the main producer on the film, I oversaw post-production. It was HARD. Next time, I'd definitely want someone else helping me so I can focus on the directing work in post.

Specifically, I needed more planning around the flow of data and information between departments. I made a schedule and met with the post-production team after production wrapped, but my lack of experience still set up some roadblocks. It was mostly little things like the file type for VFX wasn't fully compatible with the program the colourist was using. So there was some missed VFX and files that had to be re-done. We caught everything, but it added time.

Next time, I'll take the time to set all this up ahead of time. Or, better yet, have a post-production supervisor do it all. (That's the dream!)

# 11. When editing, let go of the writing and directing.

This one was hard for me. As a planner, I had a very clear picture in my head of what I wanted the story to be. Make sure you're finding and building the story with the footage you have from production.

I've heard this dozens of times now ([with many variations](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/530511/who-originally-said-a-film-is-made-written-three-times)), and it still hasn't sunk in: ""You make a movie three times. First in the writing, again in the shooting, and finally in the editing.""

While selecting the takes, I referred to the script. I looked over the storyboards. But ultimately, make sure you assess what the film truly is in post-production.) Figure out what you need to serve the story. Always come back to the story you're telling.

Going through the edit, there were a few things that just weren't serving the final story. But they were hard to let go of. Either the shots were *really* cool in the storyboards or it took so much work on the day it. Or they looked great on their own, but didn't fit the way we cut the picture. Whatever the reason, they needed to be let go.

If you're lucky enough to have an editor separate from the director on a short film, use them! They're a fresh pair of eyes. I found [an editor](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7608269/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_4_in_0_q_morgan%2520ermter) I trust, and they had some great ideas that really enhanced the final film.

# 12. With editing, find and used the unplanned moments.

Ultimately, you need to use what you have from production while editing. But make sure you really look at what you have.

While editing, there were still some things I wished we had gotten from my ""nice-to-have"" list. Unless you can see the future, I think that's unavoidable. To help with this, I just went through other takes (long after we had assembled the edit) and found little moments to use. You'd be surprised what you can find in your footage.

For example, we really needed a shot of an actor looking up. I found a moment from between takes to let grips adjust something. I think the actor looked up at me while I gave them a note. I grabbed it and it's in the final film. Another time, I found something great from after the take was done. I just let the cameras roll a bit before calling cut. Find the moments wherever you can.

Things that are ""unplanned"" can really pop on screen because they're authentic. Authenticity really shines on screen, especially with the performers. Find those moments that just come out of the the special stew of creativity you create together on the day and use them!



Okay. So that's the list. There's probably a dozen other things I learned, but I don't want you to spend longer reading this than you would watching the short film. I hope you found something valuable.

Ever found yourself staring at your computer screen, wondering where your brilliant thoughts went on vacation? **Brain fog** hits all of us like an unexpected Monday morning, right? 🙄 I was there, stuck in the haze, finding it tough to focus on just about anything. Until... I stumbled on a 10-second trick that *literally* changed my life. And no, it doesn't involve coffee (well, okay, maybe a little... ☕).

**Picture this**: You're in the middle of brainstorming or trying to plow through your email mountain when — BOOM! — your brain starts acting like an overworked hamster on a wheel. Here's the magic: 

1. **Stand up and stretch for 10 seconds.** Sounds almost too simple, but hear me out!
   - **Why?** This tiny break sends a signal to your brain: 'Hey, we're moving!' It jiggles your neurons awake, refreshing your mind.
   - Bonus: Your neck and shoulders will thank you too.

2. **While stretching, take a deep breath.** 
   - *Breathe in gratitude, breathe out the fog.*
   - Seriously, have you noticed how much we ignore our breathing when we're stressed?

3. **Visualize a mini goal.** Just one thing you want to achieve in the next hour. 
   - Makes things less overwhelming, right?
   - Plus, it feels so darn satisfying when you tick that baby off.

✨ **Why this works**: Not only does it break the monotony, but it also recharges your focus battery. It’s like a mini vacation without the sunburn. And it *saved me* at least 10 hours a week of wandering mind territory. More time to binge-watch my favorite series or chat with you awesome folks here!

Ever tried something like this? Or have your own secret tricks to banish brain fog? I’d love to know. After all, sharing is caring, especially when it comes to our precious mental energy! 🔋

So last month I, a 21 year old, ended up going to the er because I  was nauseas and dizzy with nasty muscle tremors for days on end and they found nothing except low potassium, however, I went to get more blood work done because my symptoms haven’t changed and It’s been a month. I learned they didn’t do certain tests. 

So my new results come back and my amylase and lipase are high at 138 and 257 respectively. So I got called in for more tests.

For the record, I don’t drink very much and hadn’t had a drink in months. I occasionally smoke weed and never had issues.

I’m looking up what could cause my symptoms and none of them sound very good. I’m nervous because I’ve been feeling the smallest ache in my stomach these past few days that aren’t regular cramps, it’s not as bad as the stories I’ve been seeing and the spot changes from my very bottom right to middle stomach.

However, the doctor I am seeing is more concern with the nausea which has in fact toned down a bit. It’s the muscle tremors I’m still worried about but it doesn’t seem to be caused by my elevated levels?

I’m also worried about my diet, I barely eat in the first place and all the things I may have to stay away from are the only things I like to eat. Ie coffee, crossaints, French fries, fried chicken, chocolate.

I’m dying for a coffee now and very tempted to get one, I’ve also been craving chocolate but scared it will cause a sudden decline. My symptoms have been much more manageable these past few days and I’d hate to feel like I’m dying again.

“We got the W on the squire challenge. What’s next?”

It was such an obvious gamer question, yet at the same time there was no denying that Alex was right. There were a whole lot of questions that needed answers and to get them, everyone had to get stronger. Or maybe that wasn’t the only way?

“Let’s check the message board,” Will said. “And the map.”

Everyone gathered at a desk while Alex manipulated the only functional mirror fragment.

Of the remaining challenges, only a handful could be attempted. It took a bit of searching, but the group was eventually able to find the locations of all individual class challenges. In each case, the restriction was that a single person of a specific class could participate. Will made a mental note to check whether he could try and usurp any through his copycat skill.

Of the remaining available options, one had no restrictions, but the description made it clear that it was way out of their league. What was more, there was no indication that anyone had ever attempted it in the first place.

The only remaining option was a three-person challenge that involved storming a goblin fort. While straightforward and appealing at first glance, it was suspicious why no other group had gone for it. Also, it was all the way on the other side of town and alarmingly near the archer’s suspected territory.

“I think—“ Will began.

“I think we should do the solo challenges.” Helen was faster. “We’ll get a sense of what our classes are really about.”

“Smart, sis.” Alex agreed.

“Fuck that!” Jace snapped. “Mine is all the way by the airport.”

“We can switch classes if you want,” the girl offered.

“Fuck off, Hel. I never said I’m not doing it.”

“We’ll give each other ten loops,” Will said. “Should be enough.”

“Ten is a bit much,” Helen looked at him. “But better be safe than sorry.”

“We’ll still be in touch, so if anyone needs anything, we’ll be there to help each other.” Will tried to make it sound less harsh than it was, but it was clear to everyone that he wanted some distance between himself and the rest.

To a certain degree, he wasn’t the only one. Ever since the completion of the tutorial, everyone had things they wanted to test out and thoughts that didn’t align with the rest of the group. Their last challenge had proven that. While they had gone together, everyone had focused on different things. Alex had rushed off into the goblin realm, Jace seemed more focused on coming up with some new weapon or contraption to test out, and Helen… to be honest, Will had no idea what exactly Helen wanted. He could say he felt that they had gotten closer, but at the same time there was no discounting that she remained determined to uncover the truth behind Danny’s death.

“I think that’s it.” Will looked around, giving everyone a chance to voice their concerns.

“Not how it works, bro,” Alex said, to everyone’s surprise. “We need to get back to where we were before the pause.”

“And how do we do that, muffin boy?” Jace grabbed Alex by the neck. Clearly, the limitations didn’t affect living people. “You didn’t warn us back then.”

“Bro…” the goofball said in a muffled voice, attempting in vain to break free. “Follow the…” he tapped his mirror fragment.

On cue, shimmering forms appeared in the classroom. Looking closer, they resembled semi-transparent copies of everyone. Moving in a constant loop, they moved from their initial spot to where the people currently were.

It took a few tries, but eventually everyone went back to the exact spot. Once that happened, Alex tapped his mirror fragment once more.

 

**Unpausing eternity**

 

The noises of the school abruptly returned. Chatter filled the corridor with the reminder that students should take care of their mental wellbeing.

Class continued as normal. By third period, Will had already extended his loop enough to go for his personal challenge. Despite that, he chose to remain at school. Deep inside, he was hoping that Alex and Jace would set off for their solos, granting him the opportunity to talk to Helen alone.

Alas for him, both boys stubbornly persisted, staying in class till lunch time. At that point, Will decided to go for the direct approach.

“Helen,” he said, shocking all of her friends. “Want to get a drink?”

There was a time when he would have felt completely incapable of asking that question. That was loops ago. If nothing else, eternity had taught him to mature quickly and stop sweating the small stuff.

The girl looked at him, then put her books in her backpack.

“Sure,” she said, amusing a wave of whispers around her. “You’re buying.”

By the time the two had left the school, rumors had flooded social media. It seemed that half the school was discussing the matter, posting photos, videos, as well as betting on the outcome.

“You caused quite the scandal this loop,” Helen said as the two made their way to their usual coffee shop.

“I needed to talk to you.” Will glanced about, instinctively on the lookout for mirrors. “You’re still wondering how Danny died, aren’t you?”

Helen didn’t reply.

“The tutorial changed a lot of things, but I haven’t forgotten. I just want to gain a few more skills and will—“

The girl placed a finger on his lips, preventing him from finishing.

“You’re really an idiot sometimes,” she whispered. “But that’s part of what makes you you. I already know what happened to Daniel. That’s what *I* wanted to talk to you about.”

Will didn’t know how to react. A few hundred loops back, he would have seen this as a positive development. Now, a chill ran down his spine. Had Danny contacted her, after all?

“I also know what the purpose of the challenges is.”

This completely changed Will’s attitude. If Daniel had spoken to her, she wouldn’t be so nice.

“There’s a gearing up phase in which everyone prepares for the real thing.”

 

 

\* \* \*

*Previous Loop - before the Goblin Squire Challenge*

 

Helen kept on looking at her mirror fragment. So far, the challenge remained active, but she didn’t appreciate the boys being late. The longer they took, the greater the chance that the other group swooped in to take their prize, and from what Helen had seen, it wasn’t even going to be difficult. With the permanent skills she had kept hidden from the rest, the girl had a chance of putting up some resistance, possibly taking out one or two of the other looped, yet she strongly doubted the same could be said about her classmates. Will and Jace remained newbies, and Alex was highly unreliable and likely to run when facing superior numbers.

Helen was just about to check the time on her phone when her mirror fragment flashed. Every loop so far, without fail, it would do that, indicating a new message addressed to her. Each time it would be the same: a line of song lyrics without explanation or sender. At first, Helen had taken the effort to find the lyrics and check out the entire song and artist it came from, but that had quickly lost its novelty. The sender clearly cycled between a dozen artists, sending seemingly random lines of text. 

Today was different. For one thing, the time didn’t match. For another, the text made sense.

 

***You’re Daniel’s girl?***

 

Any common person would have looked about in an attempt to spot the hidden watcher. Instead, Helen calmly responded.

 

***And who’re you?***

Her thought appeared on the mirror fragment.

 

**Spend 10 coins to send message?**

 

The girl did so without hesitation. The message was sent, followed instantly by a response.

 

***I’ll offer you a deal. I’ll let you have this challenge, but you’ll have to do something for me in exchange.***

***Yeah, right.***

***Okay, then I’ll sweeten the deal. What if I tell you the real purpose of the challenges? Will you listen to me then?***

 

That wasn’t the turn Helen expected the person to take. From what it looked like, they had been part of eternity for a while, possibly longer than her. Of course, things were rarely what they seemed.

 

***If you want to learn more, keep this between us. I’ll let you know where to meet once the challenge has started. If you tell the others about me, fight’s on.***

 

The timing of the mysterious texter was impeccable. The instant Helen looked up from the fragment, she saw Will, Jace, and Alex approach.

“You took your time,” Helen said, discreetly tapping on the surface of the mirror fragment. “Ready to go?”

Will looked about.

“Biker chick is on the roof of the building further down,” Alex said. “Can’t find the rest, though.”

The biker? That had to be the one who had contacted Helen. There was no other reason for her to let herself be spotted by Alex so easily.

“Challenge is still active.” Helen glanced down, almost hoping another message had appeared. “So, they haven’t completed it.”

“They’re letting us have a go,” Will said. “They haven’t figured out how to tackle it, so are watching what we’ll do.” He paused. “We go as planned.”

“I’ll go close to where the biker’s at,” the girl offered. “In case I need to step in.”

“And I’ll be as far away as possible,” Jace added. “You better not mess things up, stoner.”

“I won’t. If the goblin comes out where you said.”

The useless banter continued for a while longer before everyone headed to their predetermined spots. Most of the observation was done by Alex, of course. The ability to hide, sneak, and create mirror copies was indispensable when it came to surveillance and spying. That allowed Helen to modify the plans a bit. In other circumstances, her actions might have caused concern, but with the pressure of the challenge, everyone’s thoughts were focused on their part of the plan. If there was anyone to be worried about, it was Alex, but he seemed off today for some reason.

As the girl approached a building a short distance from the gas station, her mirror fragment flashed again.

 

***Good choice. I knew you were smart.***

 

Keeping her composure, Helen went up the stairs towards the roof. One of the residents saw her, but one of the advantages of being a well-dressed, innocent looking schoolgirl was that very few would consider her any sort of threat.

When she got to the rooftop access point, Helen took hold of the padlock keeping it shut, then snapped it in one brisk action. The next thing she did was draw a sword from her inventory. The biker had said she wanted to talk, but it was always better to go to a meeting armed.

Since getting medicated I have started to a unmask so much that I sometimes think I’m getting worse? My sensory and sound is killing me. I’ve lost my appetite (no one should want that). 

More than anything I feel increasing sadness that I can’t get fixed. I’m 44 and I feel like I have struggled to repress my inner weirdo my whole life. I’ve had tons of careers and haven’t been able to keep up with any of them, when people climbed up the career ladder I tried to keep my head over water. I’m at uni now but have NO confidence despite doing well. Where was my help, my fucking fidget spinners? As a child I had horrible anger attacks, hated all food and couldn’t stand being hugged. I struggled with reading faces and look everything seriously. No one suspected a thing, and it makes me furious. 

As the title states I have started to sell of things. Not just for money but they don’t suit my life anymore. All the money I have spent on dopamine shopping, sugar, coffee. I could cry. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore, clothes is just one thing, but from at least a former fashion lover, it’s important. I used to love all the prints, colours, all the things. Now all man made fabrics basically rub me the wrong way (huh see what I did there?)

I live in denim and crisp cotton shirts, it’s basically everything I can stand. Sport bras make me panic, jewellery feels restrictive. 
Has this always been me or is something wrong? Everything feels wrong. When I dress up I feel like I’m wearing drag. And I’m mourning my twenties and thirties when I should have allowed myself to be the introverted nerd that I am, instead of drinking, trying to have fun and getting burnt out because it wasn’t for me. I also mourn the the spending money I’ll never get back, the pathetic pension savings that are mine, and still feeling like I don’t belong - but maybe I could have.

I have the best husband and dog, a lovely house, and over all a great life. I just feel like I’m past my prime, and I never got to bloom.",3,1743781374.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

1jrf04y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jrf04y/time_looped_chapter_85/,Time Looped (Chapter 85),"“Lit” was hardly the word to use in the circumstances, but it was close enough. Technically, the four remained in the very same room they had always been, yet none could shake the unmistakable feeling that they had been transported elsewhere. That wasn’t the greatest change. Other than them, everything else appeared to have completely frozen in time.

“For real?” Jace uttered, finding himself at a complete loss. “What skill did you get?”

“A time pause reward,” Alex said, grinning.

So far, Will had come across several overpowered skills, but this seemed to trump all of them. Well, almost all.

The most calculating of everyone, Helen tried to take her mirror fragment. To her astonishment, it refused to move. It was as if all her knight’s strength had suddenly vanished, rendering her incapable of lifting even the lightest object.

She was not alone. When Will tried to take out his phone, he found that while he could reach inside his pocket freely he was unable to take his phone out, as if it had become made of lead.

“It’s just for talking,” Alex explained. “We can use it for meets without shortening the loop.”

“Fucking useless.” Jace laughed. Even he knew that not to be the case, though.

“If we can’t use phones or fragments, how can we plan anything?” Helen asked, looking at the goofball.

“Oh, I can,” he said. “Just the fragment. I can’t take anything out.”

“You’ve used it before?” Will didn’t like the sound of that.

“Duh. Checked it out with my copies, bro. So, what’s the plan?”

“What do you mean?”

“We got the W on the squire challenge. What’s next?”

It was such an obvious gamer question, yet at the same time there was no denying that Alex was right. There were a whole lot of questions that needed answers and to get them, everyone had to get stronger. Or maybe that wasn’t the only way?

1jreypg,https://www.reddit.com/r/saily/comments/1jreypg/greece_interesting_facts_and_travel_etiquette/,Greece: Interesting facts and travel etiquette,"Looking for travel inspiration this April? Let me tell you why [Greece](https://saily.com/esim-greece/), or as the Greeks call it, Elláda, should be at the top of your list! Here are some fascinating facts and travel etiquette tips to help you make the most of your trip:

* **Birthplace of democracy.** Greece is the cradle of democracy. The concept of democracy as we know it today was born in Athens around the 5th century BC. So, when you’re strolling around the Acropolis, just know you’re walking through the roots of modern governance.
* **There are thousands of islands.** Greece has anywhere from 1,200 to 6,000 islands depending on how you count them - but only around 170 are inhabited. Want to party? Mykonos. Want peace and turquoise waters? Milos. Take your pick!
* **80% of Greece is actually mountains.** When you picture Greece, you probably think of beaches, blue seas, and the iconic white buildings with blue domes of Santorini. However, it's actually one of the most mountainous countries in Europe. Make sure to bring some good hiking shoes if you're down for some incredible inland adventures - places like Mount Olympus are unreal.
* **Greece is a goldmine of ancient ruins.** You can visit places like the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, the ancient city of Olympia, or the ruins of Knossos in Crete, and of course, the Acropolis. It’s like walking through a giant open-air museum.
* **The Greek language hasn't changed too much in 3000 years.** Modern Greek is quite similar to the ancient Greek spoken thousands of years ago. So, if you study the ancient texts, you’ll notice a lot of similarities with how people speak today. The alphabet is unique too - make sure to try reading some signs!
* **Olives and olive oil are a big deal.** Greece is one of the largest producers of olive oil in the world. Don’t miss out on tasting some authentic Greek olive oil, as it’s a whole new level of flavor.
* **Greece has 19 UNESCO World Heritage sites.** From the monasteries of Meteora to the iconic historic center of Rhodes, Greece is home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It’s one of the highest concentrations in Europe, making it a dream destination for history and culture lovers.
* **Greek coffee is a ritual.** The traditional Greek coffee is much stronger than what you might be used to. But more importantly, it's a social experience. Greeks usually drink coffee slowly, chatting with friends or family. Don’t rush - take your time and enjoy the moment.
* **Greece has more than 250 days of sunshine a year.** With a Mediterranean climate, Greece is practically guaranteed sunshine. This makes it perfect for a summer getaway, but also for a winter escape, as the weather stays mild even in the colder months. April in Greece is usually warm without being scorching - perfect for exploring the country.
* **The Olympics started in Greece.** The very first games took place in 776 BC in Olympia as part of a festival to honor Zeus. Every time you see the torch ceremony, that’s a nod to Greece’s amazing history.

**Travel Etiquette in Greece:**

* **Learn a few Greek words.** While English is widely spoken in tourist areas, learning a few Greek words will go a long way. Try “**Kaliméra**” (Good morning) or “**Efcharistó**” (Thank you). The locals truly appreciate it, and it’ll make your trip more enjoyable!
* **Respect the siesta.** In some parts of Greece, especially in smaller towns, you’ll find that many businesses close for a few hours in the afternoon for a siesta as part of the local rhythm. If you’re planning on shopping or running errands, make sure to time your day accordingly, as some shops may be closed between 2 PM and 5 PM.
* **Be prepared for a late dinner.** Dinner in Greece typically starts much later than what you might be used to. Don’t expect to eat before 8:00 PM, and in some places, locals don’t even sit down to eat until after 9:00 or 10:00 PM.
* **Always carry cash and small change.** While credit cards are accepted in many places, some smaller shops or restaurants might only take cash. It’s always a good idea to have cash on hand, especially if you plan to shop in local markets or visit more remote areas. Small change is also handy for tipping or buying street food, so keep a few coins in your pocket!

And there you have it! I hope this post encourages you to visit Greece, and if you do, remember that Saily has you covered so you can enjoy the trip without worrying about roaming fees. Happy travels!",1,1743781237.0,saily,0,1.0,False

1jreyf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jreyf0/i_f32_not_sure_how_to_support_my_boyfriend_m37/,I f32 not sure how to support my boyfriend m37,"My partner and I have been together nearly 2 years he seems to be saying more and more lately how he feels unsupported. 


He has childhood trauma and abandonment wounds. He is a musician and lives an hour and a half train journey from me. 90% of my weekends I pay £30 train fare to travel to him because he normally has a gig somewhere near where he lives. By default I'm helping him load and unload the car for gigs.

He has ADHD and struggles to keep his house tidy. So there's obviously the typical 50/50 you cook I'll wash up things sure. Which we do. Twice in our relationship I have spent hours and hours tidying his whole house from top to bottom, folding clothes, putting them away, washing dishes, putting things back in bags etc. in this time he has been getting ready/practicing for gigs etc. 

He regularly says how he feels like he needs a parent figure to swoop in and help, like he needs so much help and someone living with him would help him be accountable yet says he knows that would be unhealthy with a partner. But he does want to live together. 

I have also spent hours doing free art for posters. Helping him with make up looks, validating and taking pictures of new outfits. Staying up late doing this. (We both have fun doing the make up part but a lot of validation and pics of him). I've also dyed his hair, he had never done that before. I have also written out a couple of to do lists for him. Once we were in a cafe and he had his laptop, I didn't realise I was meant to be helping him, I randomly mentioned that I felt tired. He went quiet, didn't like the noise in the cafe etc. Later on he said how the child in him feels like it doesn't matter if I'm tired, when someone needs support and help you support them. I said why don't we set aside a time for me to help you and we can go through everything you need to do together. This bothered him and he said everything is always put off to a later date. That he has done that all his life. That he needed the support right now. But I had no idea how to do that. He says that he is so good at supporting others but noone supports him. Noone cares. Obviously when I've done any of these things he's always really, greatful, says thank you etc. 

He has particularly struggled at times and talking through It all and saying he needs support, he needs someone to be enthusiastic about what he does. Anything less than that and he feels like he might as well not bother. He has also admitted he really struggles to manage and handle any disappointments. 

I suggested to  him putting whiteboards up and he said he already had tried that but can't bring himself to use them (ADHD) I said what if I message you every morning and ask you to tick something off/write something on? He said yeah but will you actually do that, though?

His mum paid for a PA for him and he complained and said it's sad someone needs to be paid in order for him to feel supported. If the pa doesn't have much time he gets sad and says he feels unsupported. 

He's worried about money, I offered to help him look for a temporary job while he's doing this. He said he needed to just be sad and that that wasn't helpful and he needed to just be held and supported emotionally first before suggestions. Before when I've not made suggestions, he has felt unsupported because I wasn't offering suggestions.

Maybe I am not as excitable and jumping up and down with joy enough for him at every turn. I have definitely been like this with new outfits/make up but I'm often tired from my own job and weekends and maybe don't sound enthusiastic enough about his new ideas I don't know. Is there any realistic way to actually help him to feel supported?

He says how much he does for me, makes me endless cups of tea, buys or makes coffees in the mornings, cooks (i also cook for us), drives me to work (only from his if he is also working nearby or if he stays at mine and it's a ten min drive from there) that's all great and fair enough but I have never asked for any of those things. I hate relying on others and get on with doing what I do. 

TLDR boyfriend repeatedly saying how he feels unsupported and can't handle disappointments. Says feels like a lost little boy. We both do things for each other. Not sure how to help him with this

Since then I've dropped to 48kg in 2 months, which I am fully aware is underweight, and I am going absolutely insane. For context, I had an ED for 2 years, but was recovering for almost a year and had reached 50kg with plans to gain at least 3kg more. However, even though I have added more and more food, still my weight continues to drop, when all I want is to gain (ESPECIALLY body fat).

İ was already fairly active prior to this job. I run twice a week (8-10k), lift 3x a week and sometimes go to a salsa class. I also walk to my gym when I lift (2.7km round trip), and live alone so do all my housework by myself. This new job doesn't require any lifting or exertion, but I am on my feet a lot more often or just running around the lab.

However, I don't think even this activity can warrant the amount of food I seem to eat and STILL lose weight. I don't count calories due to my past with disordered eating, but to paint a picture of yesterday (where I just did an upper body day, and my lab job, so nothing too taxing):

Breakfast: 2 pieces of whole wheat bread, good amount of cottage cheese, tomatoes and olives

Snack 1: Apple and some dried chickpeas + coffee w creamer

Lunch: chicken, salad with beets, avocado, mushrooms and generous amount of olive oil, and some quinoa

Snack 2: chocolate protein bar and tangerine and coffee w creamer

Snack 3: yogurt

Dinner: ribeye steak, lots of roast potatoes cooked in lot of olive oil, roast veggies

Dessert: grapes, some cheese and a milk tea packet thing

I am not against adding even more food but I am scared and wondering whether I might have a medical issue. Because, for the weight and height I am, I seem to eat WAY more than everyone else I see, and everyone always says ""exercise doesn't burn that much"". I'm so scared of losing more weight.

The amber glow of sunset was once a beautiful sight to me. But now, as the ruined buildings cast their shadows over what little was left of civilization, it only marked the beginning of a long night of fighting for my life again.

I think it’s been roughly six months since the end of the world, I may have lost count for a while. About six months ago, the Raven, humanity’s pride and the first space vessel of its kind, returned from its asteroid mining mission. It was a beacon of scientific achievement. Now, its crash site is a chilling monument to humanity’s utter unpreparedness. 

The initial reports had been cryptic, a strange illness, and even a few fatalities amongst the crew. But the truth, quickly buried under layers of official obfuscation and terrified silence, was far more monstrous. 

Dr. Aris Thorne, the lead astrobiologist on the Raven mission, had discovered alien bacteria among the bodies of the deceased. The symptoms of the infection seemed minor at first, coughing, progressing to a low fever, but quickly evolved into something more mysterious when the blood of the infected turned blue. Soon after this stage, we were told that the victims fell into full cardiac arrest.

Dr. Thorne and the remaining crew, driven by a desperate need to understand the disease before they all died or brought it back to Earth, became obsessed with finding a cure. One by one, they nearly all fell victim to the plague, all except Dr. Thorne.

Thorne’s transmissions became more and more frantic. Everyone thought he had simply gone mad from being alone in space, surrounded by infected bodies. Soon after that, we lost all contact with the Raven.

A few weeks later, the Raven was spotted heading back to Earth. Somehow, the doctor must have figured out how to pilot the ship to return home. It blazed like a meteor as it tore a wild streak through the atmosphere. A few of the top generals proposed the idea of shooting it out of the sky with missiles before it could make impact on the surface and cause too much damage, but others worried that the doctor could still be alive and that destroying the ship could release the bacteria into our air. Ultimately, they decided to evacuate the predicted crash site and set up a quarantine zone.

Luckily, the Raven crashed in the desert, not far from Phoenix, Arizona. The damage from the crash itself was minimal. A few days later, to the entire world’s surprise, a man claiming to be the doctor showed up in Phoenix in the middle of the night. He was completely uninjured, but naked and covered head to toe in soot.

Of course, no one believed him. There was no way he could’ve survived the crash, let alone snuck their way out of the quarantine zone and into the city from the desert, while also being nude. Everyone believed it was probably just some random drug addict who saw the crash on the news, but then he proved it.

The doctor got hold of a camera (and thankfully some clothes) and live-streamed a video online explaining various details of the ship that were confidential to anyone not from the team involved. He also explained various topics of astrobiology to prove he had extensive knowledge of the subject, even if the government claimed that the details about the Raven were false. 

No one ever heard from the doctor again, but in the following weeks, all hell broke loose. People in Phoenix and the surrounding areas got sick. The military stepped in, rounding up the infected for quarantine and cutting off travel and communication to and from the state. As the quarantine zone continued to expand, panic spread like wildfire. The news coverage, initially cautious and restrained, became increasingly frantic. The government's assurances were hollow, failing to alleviate the growing sense of dread gripping the population. Videos and images emerged online, showcasing the ruthlessness of the military, as well as several grotesque, mutilated bodies in the streets, some with blue blood and some without.

People rushed to supermarkets, drug stores, really anywhere they could, stocking up on necessities like food and medicine. Fights broke out in the inner cities. Neighbors turned on each other over something as simple as a roll of toilet paper or a can of coffee. The caffeine withdrawals in the first couple of days were no joke.

Unbeknownst to us at the time, the wealthy elite, insulated from the chaos by their wealth and power, held certain hidden knowledge. For centuries, a secret society had been infiltrating all forms of government throughout the world. They knew why the doctor was the only survivor of the crash. They knew why the disease hadn’t affected the doctor in the same way. The doctor just so happened to be biologically different from the rest of the crew. The doctor was a vampire.

1jrerii,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jrerii/completely_blindsided_and_i_have_no_idea_what_to/,Completely blindsided and I have no idea what to do next,"TW: brief self harm talk. 

Hi all, first time poster here. I'm going through by far the worst breakup of my life, and I could really use some help figuring out how to deal with it. Forgive the long post, there's a lot to unpack here. 

My ex (mid 20s F) and I (late 20s M) had been dating seriously for over a year. We were talking about moving in together, and we were openly talking about eventually getting married. Then, about three weeks ago, she broke up with me over the phone with no warning (we live in the same city). Blindsided would be an understatement. Obviously, I've been absolutely devastated since. 

We first met through mutual friends and instantly fell for each other. It was a great relationship: we were compatible, affectionate, shared the same interests and values. Its hard to describe how much chemistry we had with each other. We had met each other's families and got along great. I had her friends walk up to me more than once to tell me that they'd never seen her so happy and in love with someone. She told her friends she was going to marry me. I was the first man she's dated in years, and I was the first to ever visit her hometown and meet her family. Now, she's a conplete stranger. 

I know everyone says that there are signs before a breakup, but I truly had no idea she was even considering it. I've read through our texts leading up to it over a hundred times, I remember our conversations. At no point was there ever any indication that she was thinking of doing this. 

We had spent the entire weekend before the breakup together, and everything felt normal. We were getting along, things going as steady as they have ever been. We had a bit of a dust up when she spilled some hot coffee on me once, but that was over within a few minutes. Other than that, things were good. I even asked her friends about what she said in the lead up to our breakup and they had no idea she was upset about anything either. 

That Monday morning, we were both working remote from her place. Again, everything is fine. I eventually go home, we text like things are normal. Suddenly, that evening, she tells me she wants to talk. Over FaceTime, she drops bomb after bomb on me about things in the relationship she was upset about, things about me and what I was doing she didn't like, how I wasn't doing enough to get better. Granted, these were all things we talked about before and that I thought were either resolved or in the process of being resolved. She then I demanded I go to therapy. 

Again, I had no idea this was coming and no idea she felt this way. As the conversation kept escalating and as I got more emotional, she asked for more vulnerability. I had a bit of an outburst, and confessed to dealing with some serious recent issues with depression, including self harm ideation. I had been under an enormous amount of pressure from my job, my dad was hit with a cancer diagnosis, and I had lost a close family member last year. Things were getting to me, and I know it was impacting our relationship and it was hard on her. Still, she was aware of all of this, we talked about it, and I felt secure because she was saying that she'd always be there to help me through the hard times. Then, she suddenly wasn't. 

We end up going to bed from pure exhaustion. She texts me the next morning she needs space. That evening, she FaceTimes again and breaks up with me.

During the breakup, she said she felt I had made her an emotional crutch, that she no longer felt our relationship was healthy, and that my mental health struggles were hurting her too. I apologized, said I would go to therapy and get better, and do whatever it takes to make things right. She said no, I have demons, and she needed to ""protect herself."" Again, she had never expressed any of this to me before, especially not like this. I am the last man to admit that I'm perfect, I know I made mistakes that hurt her, but she never indicated that any of it was threatening to the relationship or that she wasn't willing to work through it. Disclosure: I never cheated, was abusive, or anything like that.  

Since then, I've been fighting through every day, trying to piece my life back together. My heart is absolutely broken, I'm confused, and to be honest I've never experienced emotional pain like this in my life. 

The worst part is that no contact really isn't an option. We have the exact same friend group, and our other friend groups overlap so much that they might as well be the same. Unless I quite literally burn down my entire social circle or end my career to move elsewhere entirely, we're going to keep seeing each other. 

About two weeks after the breakup, I broke no contact and texted her to see if she would be willing to talk about how we were going to navigate seeing each other during social functions. No response. The next day, she showed up unexpectedly at a party she knew I was already at (she had even asked one of my friends if I was there). She completely ignored me. Acted as if I wasn't there. Which is a feat, considering that this party was in an apartment and it was impossible to avoid each other. She was there with a group of girls I know she doesn't like because she told me how much she didn't like them more than once. I ignored her in kind, but we inevitably made eye contact a few times. This was the first and only time we've seen each other since the breakup. 

A few hours later, I was at a dinner in another part of the city. Having the woman I love ignore me like that after breaking my heart the way she did ended up inducing a full blown panic attack that hit during dinner. I ended up running out of the restaurant and getting on the phone with my Mom so she could talk me through it.

That was last weekend. We haven't talked or seen each other since. I unfollowed her on Instagram after I saw her like a post about how men ""don't change"" and how ""you'll never fix them"" and how ""you're brave for walking away."" She seems incredibly angry and bitter towards me, and I just can't figure this out. She's gone from the love of my life to someone who can't stand me literally overnight, and I still don't understand what I did to her. Again: I never cheated, was never abusive, and anything she was seriously upset about we talked about openly and tried to resolve. I was making a serious effort get better and make up for where I went wrong. For her to walk away like this has been devastating, and I'm at a loss as to what to do next. 

I know no contact is the best policy, but it doesn't seem feasible right now. We're going to keep running into each other, but I don't know what to do about that. Do I just keep ignoring her? Do I talk to her when I see her? Do I try reaching out one last time? 

As upset as I am for her breaking up with me and going full avoidant, I still want her back. I've had other, longer relationships, but I've never loved anyone like I loved her. I'm trying to focus on getting my own life in order. I'm going to therapy, reconnecting with my church life, hitting the gym hard, investing in my friends, and got a great new job I'm excited about. Still, nothing changes the fact that she's gone, and I still love her deeply. 

I'm considering reaching out one last time and laying out how I truly feel about her. I don't want to just give up, go no contact, then run the risk of losing her forever. I want to heal and get better for my own sake, not to get her back, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want her by my side while I'm on this journey. 

If you got this far, I'm really grateful you took the time to read my small novel. I'm open to any and all feedback you guys might have. I love this girl, and I want to do the right thing here. I'm wrestling with whether or not I should reach out that one last time, or if I should just go full no contact and hope for the best. This is the most intense heartbreak I've ever experienced, and I feel like I'm at a total loss as to what to do next. 

TLDR: GF ended a year long relationship over FaceTime. She's gone full avoidant and won't talk to me. I'm trying to get better and focus on myself, but our social circles make full no contact impossible. I want her back. What do I do next? ",1,1743780734.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

   * *Example:* If you grab coffee with the *Friends* gang at Central Perk at 10 AM and leave at 11 AM, it’ll still be 11 AM when you arrive at *The Office* or *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*.

Here are the top 10 stories impacting global trade and logistics this week:

**Trump’s “Liberation Day” Tariffs Jolt Global Trade**  
President Donald Trump has declared a U.S. economic emergency and imposed a 10% minimum tariff on all imports, with steeper “reciprocal” tariffs—up to 54%—targeting 60 nations including China, the EU, and India. The policy will be rolled out in two stages starting April 5. Economists warn that the tariffs could cost American households $5,000 annually and tip the world into recession. Stock markets reacted sharply, with Apple and Nvidia losing $470 billion in value and the Nasdaq tumbling 6%.

**Retail and Manufacturing Groups Sound Alarm Over Trump’s New Tariffs**  
Two of the most powerful business lobbies in the U.S.—the National Retail Federation (NRF) and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)—have criticized Trump’s new tariffs. The NRF says they will raise prices and worsen business uncertainty, while the NAM warns of job losses, disrupted supply chains, and lost investments. Both groups dispute Trump’s claim that tariffs will revive U.S. manufacturing. Instead, they say these moves risk weakening America’s global industrial leadership.

**Canada Strikes Back with New Tariffs After U.S. Trade Move**  
Canada has responded to Trump’s 25% auto tariffs with its own set of retaliatory duties. It will now levy 25% tariffs on U.S. vehicles that do not meet USMCA rules and on non-Canadian components used in American cars. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said all revenue will support workers affected by the trade war. Additional relief in the form of tax breaks and employment insurance will be offered to protect the country’s auto sector and related supply chains.

**Trump Ends De Minimis Exemption for China, Citing Opioid Crisis**  
President Trump has eliminated the duty-free exemption for low-value imports from China and Hong Kong, targeting companies like Shein and Temu. Starting May 2, all goods will face tariffs—even small packages. Postal shipments will be taxed at $25 per item initially, rising to $50 by June 1. Officials say the crackdown is meant to stop fentanyl smuggling via e-commerce parcels. This policy is expected to hit Chinese sellers hard and may extend to other nations in the coming months.

**Trump's Tariffs Shatter Southeast Asia’s Status as 'China Alternatives'**  
Trump’s latest round of tariffs has dealt a blow to Southeast Asia’s position as a “China-plus-one” manufacturing hub. Vietnam and Cambodia now face 46% and 49% tariffs respectively, while Thailand and Indonesia have also been hit hard. U.S. firms had increasingly moved supply chains to these countries to avoid earlier tariffs on China. Major brands like Nike and Apple are now reevaluating production plans, as the new duties disrupt years of diversification strategy.

**Shoppers Brace for Higher Prices on Essentials**  
The Consumer Brands Association warns that Trump’s tariffs will raise the cost of everyday items like toilet paper, coffee, and cooking oil. Imported inputs such as palm oil, vanilla, and wood pulp will now be taxed, increasing production costs for companies like Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola. Many of these ingredients have no U.S. substitutes, meaning consumers will bear the brunt. Industry groups expect price hikes to hit shelves as early as next month.

**US Manufacturing Contracts Again**  
U.S. manufacturing slipped back into contraction territory in March, with the ISM PMI falling to 49.0. Economists blame rising costs and uncertainty from Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The prices-paid index jumped to a 21-month high, reflecting inflation pressures. New orders and factory employment both declined, adding to fears that tariffs could stall the manufacturing recovery. Analysts now warn that the trade war may drag the U.S. economy closer to recession.

**China Reviews U.S.-Backed Panama Ports Deal**  
China’s antitrust regulator is reviewing a $23 billion deal that would transfer control of two Panama Canal ports from Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison to a U.S.-led consortium backed by BlackRock. The review could delay or alter the deal’s structure, especially after Trump’s demand to “take back the canal.” Beijing claims the transaction could impact competition and national interest. The intervention reflects growing geopolitical tension as both countries vie for influence over global infrastructure.

**Trump Slaps 25% Tariff on Imported Beer and Aluminum Cans**  
President Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on all imported beer and empty aluminum cans, effective April 4. The U.S. imported over $7.5 billion in beer last year, with Mexico accounting for $6.3 billion alone. Industry leaders say the duties will increase beverage prices and strain supply chains. While the tariff applies to beer made from malt, glass-bottled beer is not affected. U.S. brewers warn that consumers could see price hikes in time for summer.

**Lineage Expands Pacific Northwest Footprint with Bellingham Cold Storage Buy**  
Cold storage giant Lineage has acquired three facilities from Bellingham Cold Storage in Washington, adding 24 million cubic feet of space. This move strengthens Lineage’s foothold at the Port of Bellingham, a key hub for seafood and agri-exports. The company plans to upgrade the sites to better serve growing demand in the Pacific Northwest. The acquisition is part of Lineage’s broader strategy to scale its presence across U.S. ports and temperature-controlled logistics.

I’m a 50-year-old woman who’s lived, loved, learned, and still believes the best is yet to come. Life has taught me to cherish laughter, value honesty, and find joy in both the big and small things. I’m at a stage in my life where I know who I am, what I want, and what I simply won't settle for and I find that incredibly empowering.

I’m not here chasing perfection or fairy tales, but I do believe in genuine connections.those rare, magnetic moments when conversation flows effortlessly, time seems to slow down, and something just clicks. I’m drawn to kindness, emotional intelligence, a good sense of humor, and people who are still curious about life. Someone who’s been through a few storms, come out stronger, and is still open to love that’s my kind of person.

I enjoy meaningful conversations just as much as quiet moments. Whether it's a walk in nature, a good book, music that moves the soul, or just sipping coffee and sharing stories, I believe connection can be found in the simplest of moments.

If you're emotionally available, ready to explore what a deep connection can look like at this stage in life, and appreciate a woman who knows her worth, then I’d love to hear from you.

Not out loud, at least. Not after all these years. But when I saw that TikTok — the one where parents were teaching their kids lessons through ""tough love"" — something in me snapped. I don't know why it took so long for the memories to flood back, but once they did, I couldn't ignore the weight of them. The floodgates opened, and I realized that after 20 years of silence, it was finally time to say everything.



It was July of 2005. I was 16, and my parents, Gerald and Denise, had always believed that discipline meant toughening me up. They didn’t believe in participation trophies or coddling. Every day was an opportunity to ""build character,"" or so they said. There were the early mornings, the endless chores, the punishments that never seemed to end — all under the guise of teaching me how to be “a man of the world.”



But that day at the gas station? That was a turning point. That was the day my life would change forever, whether I liked it or not.



We were on our way back from visiting my older sister, Sabrina, at college, a 4-hour drive from home. I had spent most of the trip dozing in the back seat, half listening to my iPod, when my dad’s voice suddenly broke through. “Scott, go get me a coffee,” he barked. I groaned and climbed out of the car, grabbing the cash he handed me. I shuffled into the old, run-down gas station. The cashier, an older man who looked like he hadn’t seen a decent night’s sleep in decades, was busy with a broken coffee machine. I stood there, barely paying attention to the seconds that ticked by.



When I came out, coffee in hand, I saw it. The car, our beat-up Camry, was gone.



I stopped in my tracks, my brain processing the absurdity. I looked around, thinking maybe they’d just moved to a different pump, but no. I saw the tail lights of the car as it disappeared down the highway, heading toward the horizon.



I pulled out my phone and checked the text from Mom:



""Let's see how long it takes you to get home. Consider this a lesson in problem-solving."" That smiley face was a slap in the face.

I just wanted to ask if anyone knows any good vitamins or supplements that help with memory or thinking clearly?

I have epilepsy, and I think the medicine makes my brain feel kind of slow. Sometimes I forget words or feel foggy, and it’s hard to focus. I’m 44 and I already take a men’s multivitamin, a B-complex, and hemp oil (sometimes flaxseed or fish oil, depending on what I can find).

I used to take some brain supplements, but my doctor told me not to because of something in them called Ginkgo Biloba. I stopped energy drinks and only drink one or two coffees a day now.

I saw some brands like Neurogan, Alpha Brain, and Mind Lab Pro, and I was wondering if anyone has tried those? Or maybe something else that’s safe for people with epilepsy?

Tape Two, Side One:

\[Clicking noise. Tape starts.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is still May 8^(th) of 2027. I am with Miss Espinoza and Jack Carmody. The hypnotics have seemingly took effect, and the subject appears to be stable and relaxed, ready for session three to begin. All diagnostic testing came back within parameters and both the implant and machine are active. Jack, can you hear the sound of my voice?

Carmody: Yes. Perfectly.

Benton: Are you ready to begin?

Carmody: Yes.

Benton: Miss Espinoza, please connect the machine and initialize the implant.

\[There is a burst of interference a moment later.\]

Espinoza: Initializing now, doctor.

Benton: Can you still hear me, Jack?

Carmody: Yes.

Benton: Good, just relax. Start thinking back. Back to the day you got on the boat.

Carmody: I can see it. I can hear the water lapping at the sides of the boat.

Benton: Miss Espinoza, start the pump.

Espinoza: Starting. \[Brief pause.\] It's active.

Benton: Mister Carmody, can you describe to me what you see on your arrival to the rig?

Carmody: I see the guys waiting to trade places with us standing on the deck, most of them looking exhausted. A few of them chatting quietly. I am climbing the ladder, and collecting my bag. I walk to my assigned bunk and pack my things in the footlocker and dresser.

Benton: That's good, Jack. What do you do next?

Carmody: I go to my monitoring station, but the drill is not running yet. I take the time to go get a cup of coffee.

Benton: Is it normal for the drill to be inactive at that time of day? If so, why is that? Once again, be as detailed as possible.

Carmody: It was normal maintenance. Cleaning the bit and the hydraulic lines that operated the machinery. It only took an hour after my arrival before the drill was running again.

Benton: They didn't find any defects during the maintenance process?

Carmody: None.

Benton: What happened next?

Carmody: Everything was normal at least until I went to bed. If anything happened later, it wasn't reported, and the monitors didn't register it.

Benton: What about the day of the first temperature spike?

Carmody: At first, that's all it was. The system just kept kicking back overheat codes. We opened the walls to flood the bit with sea water when the cooling system proved insufficient. We shut down long enough for the bit to cool down. When it did, the walls were closed and the water was pumped out of the hole. It took a few hours before we got the order to return to our stations.

Benton: Did they examine the drill itself during that time?

Carmody: No.

Benton: What happened next?

Espinoza: Sir, we're getting a strange reading from the implant. His hear rate is rising.

Carmody: We started drilling again. That's when we hit the hard spot.

Benton: The hard spot. What was it?

Carmody: We never looked. Just kept drilling.

Espinoza: His heart rate is still rising. His brainwaves are starting to fluctuate.

\[There is a burst of static and interference.\]

Carmody: The fog. No. Stop. No. No.

Benton: Relax, Mister Carmody.

Carmody: No. No, no, no, no.

Espinoza: We're shutting down.

Benton: Don't shut down the implant or machine. I can help him come back from this. Jack. I need you to listen to the sound of my voice. What you're seeing is not real. You are not on the oil rig. Do you hear me?

\[Short pause.\]

Carmody: Yes. I hear you.

Espinoza: Pulse is returning to normal. Brain function is still going wild.

Benton: Relax, Jack. Think about where you are.

Carmody: Violet Hills?

Benton: That's right. Do you remember my name?

Carmody: Warren... Doctor Benton.

Benton: That's right. Just relax. Miss Espinoza. How is his brain activity?

Espinoza: Still going nuts. I suggest we shut down.

Benton: Fine. Deactivate the implant and machine, and transport the subject to the sensory deprivation tank.

\[Tape cuts abruptly.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. The subject is still in the float tank, and I haven't even bothered to transfer the data yet. I am beginning to think that this experiment is doomed to fail. I will have to delay session four if the patient makes a full recovery and shows no signs of cognitive or motor decline. The Director is going to be unhappy, but I am not quite ready to give up in spite of the doubts that I just expressed. I only hope that Miss Espinoza is still on my side. I'm positive that her support hinges on the patient's health, which I can understand.

I tend to lose sight of details when I am thinking in the broader sense of the good this procedure could do. I will update tomorrow with a status update on the subject.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 9^(th) of 2027. The subject was transferred from the sensory deprivation tank to his room without incident. He has been sleeping peacefully without sedatives and from the notes on his chart, has not reported any side effects. I am waiting for Camille to get here so that she can run the diagnostic tests on the implant. I will check the machine myself. I will also review the data we were able to attain yesterday before I meet with mister Carmody later this afternoon. We will also be conducting cognitive testing.

It is my genuine hope that there has been no physical or mental damage. I am beginning to consider removing the implant...

\[There is a knock at the door and the tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 9^(th) of 2027. Miss Espinoza arrived about ten minutes ago, and we went over the plan for today. I am just about to start reviewing the data from session three soon. I hope there is something positive in it that I can bring up in my inevitable call with the Director today. There is a small chance I may agree to shut the project down, but that largely hinges on mister Carmody's recovery. Even if he is physically and mentally stable, I feel it is only fair to ask if he wants to continue the procedure.

Miss Espinoza voiced her feelings that it might be time to stop this morning, which is seriously making me doubt myself. I will update again after the notes from the subject's assessments come back.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton and it is early afternoon on May 9^(th) of 2027. I have reviewed the notes from the subject's cognitive tests, and the results are extremely encouraging. He is showing no signs of brain or nerve damage, or any other negative effects. I have not spoken with Mister Carmody or the Director yet, however. I have been procrastinating, if I am honest. I should get back to reviewing the data from the point in time where he was having the panic episode. I will update at the end of the day.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is late evening of May 9^(th) of 2027. The Director was disappointed with my updates, but did see the positives when I was able to bring them into the conversation. He has left the continuation of the program to my discretion. After the interview with Miss Espinoza and Mister Carmody, I have decided to continue again after a three day pause to monitor his health and the function of the implant. I still believe that a breakthrough is within our reach in this case. I am going to make some adjustments to the machine over the next few days.

I will probably employ Camille's help with that. I really do think I am onto something. I will update again when something significant happens or we are prepared to try again.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton it is May 11^(th) of 2027. All of the results of the cognitive tests as well as the subject's scans and bloodwork. There is no sign of damage and he seems fine mentally. Mister Carmody also seems to be in good spirits. He continues to spend his free time in the common room with John, playing go fish or one of our various board games. He also continues to participate in the group sessions, and is still doing very well in that setting. Some of his hesitation to relate to other patients seems to have faded over the short time he has been here.

This has bolstered the hope that I'd had when this project first started. While I cannot yet prove it, I believe that even our failed attempts have had a positive effect on the subject's mental health. The data we have retrieved and reviewed so far is encouraging but inconclusive. I will update later today after my call with the Director.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is still May 11^(th) of 2027. I just got off of the phone with the Director. While he was unhappy with the inconclusive results that I offered, he allowed the project to remain under my direct control. I informed him that I plan to resume the procedure on the 14^(th), and was of course ordered to report back immediately afterward. I had expected no less. I have a feeling that he is dealing with people breathing down his neck. I'm just relieved he isn't taking it out on me at this point. Miss Espinoza should be arriving soon and we should be able to make the tweaks to the machine.

I will update again when I have something to add.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is the afternoon on May 11^(th) of 2027. Camille and I have just finished making the hardware and software changes that I proposed, and all of the diagnostic tests checked out fine. I am just about to have the subject brought into the treatment room to update the firmware of his implant, during which I will have to interview him to ensure that the process doesn't interfere with his mental faculties. I will update again when I have something significant to record.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 13^(th) of 2027. The subject has remained stable and in good spirits. He is as excited as I am to resume the procedure. As the weather warms, he had been spending more time out in the fitness complex, and has encouraged John and a few other patients to join him. I am glad to see him coming out of his shell, and hope that we can provide a real path to relative normalcy for Mister Carmody. He seems well upon the way. I an hopeful that tomorrow brings progress, if not a complete breakthrough.

I will update again tomorrow morning.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 14^(th) of 2027. I have just arrived at Violet Hills, and am happy to report that there were no incidents happened last night. I am waiting for the subject to wake up and Miss Espinoza to arrive before we attempt session four. I am hopeful that the changes we have made will yield better results. I will resume recording when we begin the session.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 14^(th) of 2027. I am with Miss Espinoza, and we are awaiting the arrival of the subject. The machine is active and stable.

\[The sound of the door opening and wheels rolling across a tile floor can be heard along with a lot of jostling and rustling. The sounds of restraints being buckled can also be heard.\]

Benton: Mister Carmody has just arrived. Can you hear me, Jack?

Carmody: Yes, I hear you.

Benton: Good. How are you feeling?

Carmody: Relaxed. Kind of sleepy.

Benton. I need you to stay relaxed, Jack. Do not focus on the colors you are about to see. Miss Espinoza, please connect the machine.

\[There is a burst of interference and static.\]

Espinoza: Initializing. Everything seems good so far.

Benton: Everything is good on my monitor as well. Mister Carmody, I need you to take a deep breath, and remember the oil rig. Can you see it?

Carmody: Yes, I can see it.

Benton: Very good. Think about the day that the drill overheated. What happened when you broke through?

Carmody: There was a crashing sound. The oil rig shook. The drill started overheating again. I am trying to cool it down, but nothing is helping.

Espinoza: We're getting some weird readings from the implant, sir.

Benton: I see them. Adjust the alpha values by three degrees. Mister Carmody, are you still with me?

Carmody: Yes, I hear you.

Benton: I need you to stay calm. Remember that you are safe. What happened next?

Carmody: We shut down the drill, and after a short meeting, Quentin gave the order to bring the bit up to check it for damage. I was part of the team sent in to examine the machinery. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. The metal had melted, parts of it worn clean and shiny by the heat and pressure.

Carmody: You said before that Quentin had ordered the bit to be changed, but you were already using the spare. What happened next?

Carmody: We stayed shut down until a new part could be brought out to us. A storm delayed the ship, but it finally arrived.

Benton: What happened when your team tried to change the bit?

Carmody: That's when we heard the sound coming from the hole. At first we dismissed it as the wind. Then it happened again. It almost sounded human. Like someone crying out in pain.

Espinoza: His heart rate and blood pressure are rising. Brain activity is off the charts. Pump and implant are functioning normally.

Benton: Relax, Jack. You're safe here.

Carmody: That's when the fog started rolling out of the hole, after the screams. It was thick, and smelled like something gone sour in the sun. We gagged and coughed. No. No. I didn't. I couldn't...

Benton: Jack. Relax. Remember where you are. Miss Espinoza, please deactivate the machine and implant.

Carmody: Violet Hills?

Benton: That's right, Jack. You're safe in Violet Hills. We're going to move you to the float tank now, okay.

Carmody: Yes, that's okay.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 14^(th) of 2027. The subject is resting in the sensory deprivation tank. I am not going to call our short session a failure. If anything it only bolsters my belief in the success of this project. We will continue tomorrow barring a major setback.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I'm keen to make this a bit of a series, so please feel free to mention some interesting ones in the comments!

Hopefully with a more social/feel good angle? I know Grind does the compostable pods/eco friendly thing, but it's not quite scratching the itch.

It's an impressive story - but I'd love my next piece to be impressive, useful AND hopeful.

""Welcome to part 1 in our documentary series from Finca Tamana.  
  
For a long time, we have wanted to give you a closer look at life on a coffee farm – to show you how each stage of coffee production really works. Even for those of us who work with coffee every day, it can be hard to fully understand the process without seeing it for ourselves.  
  
That is why Tim invited Håkon from Rammelaus to join him on a recent trip to Colombia and Finca Tamana. Together, they documented every step of the journey so that we could share it with you.  
  
Since 2012 we have been working very closely with don Elias and Bellanid at Finca Tamana in Huila, Colombia in order to help them improve the quality of their coffees. Since then we have tried to look at every detail on the farm involving the coffee production to optimise the farms potential to produce consistent and high quality coffee.  
  
The first year we started buying the coffees from this farm the average score of the traditional coffees were about 83 points. 13 years later we are experiencing the same coffees with average scores of 86,5 points. But that does not tell the whole story. Through hard and smart work, a long term plan and a lot of patience we are now able to purchase a wide range of coffees, each with distinct flavour profiles.

Before now I've been using a 1zpresso J-Max hand grinder. With the J-Max I was able to get great shots for milk, but wanted more clarity for enjoying straight espresso closer a great local cafe. With the J-Max I only got 1 really clean, almost god shot. So upgraded to the Philos chasing those shots (flat burrs, low retention, etc). I got it in a couple days ago and have made less than 20 espressos with 'good specs'. From the color, I would call the beans medium to medium-light roast, 18g in, 48g out in 25-30. The shots I'm getting, like with the hand grinder, are great for milk drinks, but still lacking for straight espresso.

Coffee is: Pink Elephant Roasters - Wayfarer Espresso (Central and South Americas, 1300-1900m elevation, washed and natural process. Tasting is chocolate, honeycomb and amaretto. Roast date is March 20, 2025.

Prep: 18g, WDT and tamped until no more movement. I have tried with and without a puck screen from Etsy (57mm on the Lelit Anna has limited options). Using a bottomless Ascaso 16g basket (fits 18g of this roast without leaving a dimple from the screw in the brew group). Tried temp  on the PID at 93c and 96c.

Forgive my use of non-standard flavor words. The shots are sharp with a lot sourness (I think... maybe bitterness...?) and don't have much if any of the clarity I was hoping for. To get the 'proper specs' out of the shot, I need grind on setting 33-35. From what I have read this seem high for the Philos. I have heard a couple reports of issues with the burrs on new units, but haven't checked them yet. 

  
Am I expecting too much from the Philos or does it need more seasoning (even though they are supposed to be pre seasoned)? Anyone else getting good results on setting 33-35 for espresso or is this really wrong? ",2,1743779767.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

For those of us who don’t really have that option and never had any kids, what’s your plan for old age? At some point you will need help. 

My husband makes a good living at a regular corporate remote job and I work from home as a dog groomer. I have a very nice house in a nice neighborhood with 200k equity. It’s big and set up where cleaning it and fussing with it is annoying. I have a formal dining room with formal furniture and fancy dishes. I never use any of it. I eat at my coffee table in front of the tv. Lately I’ve been reviewing my life and looking at land. For about a decade now I’ve been wanting to get land and live small. I wondered if others would want to live on our land? Nothing crazy, nothing political nothing religious. Just normal people who still all work but if we someone to pick us up from a colonoscopy or help we would have a social net. Maybe form better social ties. 

I used to do legal work and have been looking into what other communities do and how they make it work. Clearly, you would have to have by-laws and rules in place I think small cells of five family type units and no more would work better than a big group where too much conflict can occur. 

Has anyone thought of this as a possibility for our situations? I even have a car people could share to get to town or go to doctors appts. 

I have the money for about 10 acres and helping others and growing relationships as we age seems like a mutually beneficial thing. I think about this a lot and all the problems but also all the benefits. ",28,1743779716.0,GenX,34,1.0,False

* **Grinder:** Turin SD40 v2 (modded with 3D print to be stepless)
* **Espresso Machine:** Breville Bambino Plus

# Espresso Workflow

1. Weigh out 20g of beans
2. Spray 3 times with a mini water atomizer & shake to distribute
3. Place beans in hopper & turn on grinder
4. Preheat the grouphead/portafilter by running a blank shot
5. Hit the grinder bellow twice to remove retention & turn off grinder
6. Dose grounds into the portafilter
7. Use Spirographic WDT tool & tamp
8. Lock in portafilter & pull shot (10s pre-infusion, stop at 30s / 40g output)

# The Upgrade Dilemma

I might just be dealing with a case of *upgradeitis*, but I’ve been eyeing a DF54 or DF64 Gen 2.3 to move from conical to flat burrs. The problem? I have no idea what I prefer. I enjoy espresso both at home and in cafes, but I’ve never done a direct comparison between burr types.

A few key points about my coffee habits:

* I **primarily** use my grinder for espresso (rarely for anything else).
* I **occasionally** brew pour-over (V60) using my 1Zpresso JX-PRO for the grinder.
* I switch between **straight espresso, Americanos, and milk drinks** depending on my mood.
* I mainly use **medium and dark roasts** but also enjoy light roasts.
* At the end of the day, I just want my coffee to taste good—I’m not super picky.

I don't have any real complaints about my current setup, but I reached out to Espresso Outlet about upgrading my SD40 v2 with the [Grinder Dial](https://espressooutlet.com/collections/sd40s-parts/products/sd40s-black-grinder-dial) from the new SD40S. They said it’s possible but tricky, as it involves swapping the upper housing and removing the motor. I’m waiting to hear if they sell the parts separately, as I might just do that instead of a full grinder upgrade.

# The Big Questions

1. If you’ve switched from **conical to flat burrs**, was it worth the money?
2. Would my **$400 budget** be better spent elsewhere, or am I just upgrading for the sake of upgrading?

Would love to hear thoughts from anyone who’s made this switch!",3,1743779703.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

""But the 3D is going backwards or not moving at all, this doesn't work.""

Now let me ask you this: Who is saying that?

The version of you who has it? Or your old story?

One of the key aspects of manifesting is understanding this: 

**Every circumstance can be looked at from your old story or from the new one.**

This is basically what Neville talks about living in the end, assuming you already have what you want. Thinking from your wish fulfilled instead of thinking about it.

So, how do we practice this?

I was doing something that a YouTuber put in better terms, so I'll use that.

It's called Deny, choose, be.

What are you denying? Your old point of view, your old story.

What are you choosing? Your new story, your wish fulfilled point of view.

What are you being? The person who has your desire and looks at the world from it.

Here are some examples:

Desire: being with SP, 

New version of you: you're with Sp already.

3D circumstance: A photo with someone. Your old story goes ""SP is with this person, this doesn't work"". At that moment, you deny it, choose and be, ""Nope, sp is already with me, that's just a friend"". 

Or SP doesn't message you. Old story: ""SP must be with someone else, is mad, etc""

""Nope, SP must be thinking about me and thinking what to message me.""

Another example.

Desire: Being wealthy.

3D circumstance: A bill came in, you need money, etc.

Old story: ""Damn, I keep losing money and I won't be able to pay for that other thing"" 

""Nope, I always have more money than I need to"" or ""Nope, I always have more than enough to do whatever I want"".

If you're reading this and feel like you would be lying to yourself if you apply this, let me tell you that these ways of thinking ARE normal for people who have good relationships and money. 

They don't think about it in the sense of thought, but they just accept as normal these types of assumptions.

What you want is to reach a point where these assumptions are just your normal way of living.

That's what living in the end means. You're looking at the 3D from the perspective of the version of you who has your desire.

You're changing yourself so that the 3D reflects it back at you.

If you have any questions, you can message me or ask below.

Some of you ask me if you could buy me a coffee for being helpful. If you want, you can donate to me here [https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666](https://ko-fi.com/bowler5666). I'll probably use it to bring food to a stray dog shelter nearby.

Hope this helps.

1jre5ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1jre5ky/anyone_else_not_counting_caloriestracking_food/,Anyone else NOT counting calories/tracking food?,"I stopped tracking and counting after the first week or so because I have been dieting my whole life and I know how obssessive I can become.   
  
In the past I've been known to refuse to eat at restaurants that didn't include nutrition info on their website because I needed to know exactly how many calories I was having. It would take me twice as long to cook dinner because I had to stop and weigh everything and try to figure out how many portions it would make. I would count out grapes, and weigh my apples in grams. I'd spend hours on this when I could be out taking a walk, or spending time with family. It was unhealthy behavior. Plus I don't want to do anything this time that I'm not willing to do the rest of my life.

Now I just try to listen to my body, make good choices, eat modest portions. It feels so freeing! I still look at nutrition labels to choose things with zero to very few added grams of sugar, (but also have the occasional reeses, or add the occasional packet of abuelita to my coffee.) And I keep an eye out  to make sure I am getting enough protein. But by now I know what 3/4 cup of Fage Greek yogurt looks like instead of weighing it to the gram. :) And it's OKAY if I have 19 grapes instead of 17. :D 

Anyway, this is NOT a judgement on anyone who does count and track. Everyone has to do what works best for THEM!  I just see the mention of calories here a lot, and was just curious if there are others like me. ",31,1743779231.0,Zepbound,50,0.9,False

Will coffee give you cancer, or will it help you live longer?  If you're confused about what nutrition science has to say about which foods are healthy and which are not, you're not alone. But why is it so hard to figure out what's good for us, and why does the advice seem to change constantly? This week on Gastropod, we reveal the hidden history of how nutrition science got started, why its early successes saved millions of lives, and how those successes then led the field astray. From debunking the Blue Zones, to the discredited “French paradox” that had everyone washing their Brie down with glasses of red wine, to the most recent research on ultra-processed foods, we’re breaking down how nutrition research actually gets done—and what that means for what should be on your plate. ",4,1743778890.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

I had a terrible post partum period after breaking my pelvis during delivery and being hospitalized for sepsis a couple of weeks later due to the immobility. I was in 24/7 pain and discomfort for the first two months, with lasting impacts that I'm still dealing with 14 months later. More than just the physical pain, I struggled to bond with LO for almost 6 months. Looking back I definitely had PPD that went undiagnosed because of the physical chaos I was dealing with. I spent at least the first 2-3 months (maybe longer 😳) genuinely believing I made a mistake. I'm so happy those days are in the past, I wouldn't go back if I could. 

Now though, LO is 14 months old and such a joy. He loves to play, he sleeps through the night (kind of lol), he takes 3 hour naps, we just got back from a family trip to Bali and he loved every moment of it, every morning he plays by himself for an hour while I read my book and drink my coffee. He gets full body excitement shakes when he sees an ant on the sidewalk, the whole world is full of adventure and wonder and things to explore. We spend our days playing, going to the library, going for walks around the neighbourhood, eating snacks, and visiting friends. I wish I had a crystal ball in those early days so I could see us now, we are living the future I dreamt of and clung to during those dark days but I couldn't be sure that it would ever arrive. 

If you're in those newborn trenches I see you, it's so hard. I won't say the cliche ""it gets better!"" but just know that this time will pass 💚",8,1743778748.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

However, after a couple of years, a trial of medication, a.k.a. Protonix And multiple esophagus exams, I have found that I have to stay on an acid blocker in order for me to be able to eat. I went a year on a liquid diet last year and it was brutal. I lost some weight that I wanted to lose, but I gained it all back since I’ve been eating again. I’m on here because I still have a difficult time swallowing pills as they always get stuck. My doctor had put me on esomeprazole, but I continued taking over-the-counter omeprazole as they had a dissolvable tablet. Well, after a good 3 to 4 months on the omeprazole, I began having multiple side effects such as Painful bumps on my tongue, headaches, abdominal bloating, and pain. As soon as I stop taking it all of the side effects went away. I have a really hard time changing my diet as I really enjoy spicy food and coffee. There’s a lot of things I’m willing to give up but the hardest thing I’ve not been able to give up yet is coffee. I’m currently waiting on my doctor to prescribe yet another medication so I can continue eating because as soon as I stop taking my medication, I have the worst burning sensation and pain when I swallow any food as well as the tightness feeling in my esophagus, and a lot of regurgitation that burns. I don’t wanna be on lifelong PPIs so I know I’m gonna have to change my diet. It’s just been really hard these last couple of years considering I’ve had various different health issues arise. I also have asthma that was induced during pregnancy that I am now on a lifelong inhaler for as well as nasal polyps that began during my pregnancy. I do believe that the acid reflux also is affecting my breathing and whatever inflammation I have in my body is continuing to keep the nasal polyps, inflamed and my allergies have just gotten so much worse.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and suitability of custom styrofoam cups depend on several key features. From insulation properties to printing capabilities, each aspect plays a crucial role in the overall product performance and user satisfaction.

**insulation Properties**

Styrofoam's inherent insulating properties are a primary reason for its popularity in beverage cups. The closed-cell structure of styrofoam minimizes heat transfer, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for extended periods. A well-designed styrofoam cup will maintain the temperature of its contents noticeably longer than paper or plastic alternatives, enhancing the drinking experiance. The thickness and density of the styrofoam material directly impact the insulation effectiveness.

**Customization Options**

The ability to customize the cup with logos, designs, or text is a major draw for businesses and individuals alike. High-quality custom styrofoam cups offer a variety of printing options, including multiple colors, detailed graphics, and wraparound designs. The printing process should ensure that the ink is durable and resistant to smudging or fading, even with frequent handling and exposure to condensation.Moreover, the available print area is a factor to consider, as some designs may require more space than others.

**Cup Size and Capacity**

Custom styrofoam cups are available in a range of sizes to accommodate different beverage types and serving sizes.Common sizes include 8-ounce,12-ounce,16-ounce,20-ounce,and 32-ounce options. The choice of size will depend on the intended use, whether it's for serving coffee, soda, or other drinks. Ensure that the selected size is suitable for your target audience and the types of beverages you plan to serve.The capacity should be clearly stated and accurate, minimizing discrepancies and ensuring consistent serving sizes.**Material durability and Structure**

While styrofoam is known for its lightweight nature, the durability of the cup is still critically important. A well-constructed styrofoam cup should be sturdy enough to withstand normal handling without easily crushing or deforming. Look for cups made from high-quality Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) that offers both insulation and structural integrity. The rim of the cup should be smoothly finished to prevent leaks and provide a agreeable drinking experience. Proper density and uniform thickness contribute to overall durability and prevent premature wear.

**Lid Compatibility**

For to-go orders or events where spillage is a concern, lid compatibility is essential.High-quality custom styrofoam cups should be designed to securely fit standard-sized lids, preventing leaks and maintaining beverage temperature. the lid should snap on tightly and remain in place even when the cup is tilted or moved. Check for compatibility with different lid materials, such as plastic or paper, to offer customers a choice of options. Ensure that the lid material is also food-safe and resistant to cracking.

## Core Benefits

Custom styrofoam cups offer several distinct advantages over alternative beverage containers. These benefits range from cost-effectiveness to enhanced branding opportunities.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Styrofoam cups are typically more affordable than paper or plastic alternatives,making them an attractive option for businesses and events with budget constraints. Their lightweight nature also contributes to lower shipping costs. For large-scale events or high-volume usage, the cost savings can be notable, allowing you to allocate resources to other areas. The relatively low cost per cup makes it easier to offer complimentary beverages or reduce pricing for customers, enhancing overall value.**Brand Promotion**

Custom styrofoam cups provide an excellent opportunity to promote your brand and increase brand visibility. By printing your logo,company name,or marketing message on the cups,you can create a mobile advertisement that reaches a wide audience. Every time someone uses your cup, they are exposed to your brand, reinforcing brand recognition and creating a lasting impression. This form of advertising is notably effective for local businesses, coffee shops, and event organizers.

**Enhanced Insulation**

Styrofoam's superior insulation properties keep beverages at the desired temperature for longer periods. This is especially important for hot drinks like coffee or tea, where maintaining warmth enhances the drinking experience. Similarly, cold drinks stay colder for longer, preventing them from becoming lukewarm and unappealing. This improved insulation not only enhances customer satisfaction but also reduces the need for constant refills, saving time and resources.

**Lightweight and Portable**

Styrofoam cups are incredibly lightweight, making them easy to carry and transport. This is particularly beneficial for outdoor events, catering services, and to-go orders. Customers can easily hold the cups without fatigue, and businesses can efficiently transport large quantities without adding excessive weight. Their stackable design also contributes to efficient storage and space optimization, minimizing logistical challenges.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about custom styrofoam cups to help you make an informed decision.

**What type of ink is used for printing on styrofoam cups?**

The ink used for printing on styrofoam cups is typically a specialized solvent-based ink designed to adhere to the EPS material. These inks are formulated to be durable,water-resistant,and resistant to fading or smudging. They are also food-safe and comply with relevant health and safety regulations. The specific type of ink may vary depending on the printing method and the desired color vibrancy.

**Are styrofoam cups recyclable?**

While styrofoam is technically recyclable, the availability of styrofoam recycling programs varies significantly depending on location. Many municipal recycling programs do not accept styrofoam due to the challenges of processing and the relatively low market value of recycled styrofoam. However, dedicated styrofoam recycling facilities and drop-off centers exist in some areas. Check with your local recycling program to determine if they accept styrofoam cups.**Can I order custom styrofoam cups in small quantities?**

Yes, many suppliers offer custom styrofoam cups in small quantities, even though the minimum order quantity (MOQ) may vary. Some suppliers specialize in low-quantity orders, making it feasible for individuals or small businesses to order personalized cups for small events or promotional purposes. Keep in mind that the cost per cup may be higher for small orders compared to bulk orders.

# Best ⁢iPhone 16 Pro Max Privacy Screen protector: buyer's Guide

The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to be a powerhouse of technology, packed with cutting-edge features adn a stunning display. Protecting that ⁢investment, and your personal information, is paramount. Privacy screen ‌protectors are designed to shield your screen from prying eyes, limiting the viewing angle so only you can see what's on your display. With a plethora of options available,this⁣ guide will help you navigate the market and choose the best privacy screen protector for ‌your iPhone 16 Pro Max.

[[Explore Top Rated iphone 16 pro max privacy screen protector on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/ebook-readers/?kw=iphone 16 pro max privacy screen protector)

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal iPhone 16 Pro ‍Max privacy screen protector should offer‌ a blend of privacy, protection, and usability.Several key features dictate its performance in ‌these areas.

**Privacy ‍Technology:** The heart of any privacy screen protector is its light-filtering ⁣technology. This usually involves micro-louvers – tiny vertical blinds – embedded within the screen protector that narrow‌ the viewing angle. Premium models will have a viewing angle of around‍ 30 ​degrees from the center,⁢ effectively blacking out the screen for anyone looking from the side.The effectiveness of this technology determines how well it prevents visual hacking in crowded environments. Cheaper models may offer a wider viewing angle, reducing their effectiveness.

**Material and Hardness:** The material​ used contributes to the durability and ⁤feel of the screen protector. Tempered glass is the most common option, offering excellent scratch resistance and impact protection.⁣ Look for‌ a hardness rating of 9H on the⁤ Mohs scale, which indicates a high level of resistance to scratches ‌from keys, coins, and other everyday objects. Some screen protectors incorporate ​additional layers of PET film for shatter resistance, preventing the glass from splintering upon impact.

**Thickness and Touch Sensitivity:** The thickness of the screen protector directly impacts touch sensitivity and clarity. Thicker screen protectors may offer better protection but can also reduce touch responsiveness and introduce slight distortions. A thickness of around 0.33mm is a good balance between protection and usability. additionally, look ​for screen protectors that boast high openness ⁤and ‍maintain the iPhone 16 Pro Max's display clarity and color accuracy.

**Oleophobic Coating:** Fingerprints and smudges are a common annoyance on smartphone⁤ screens. An oleophobic coating repels oils and reduces fingerprint accumulation, making it ⁢easier to keep the screen clean. A high-quality oleophobic coating will ​also make ⁤the screen smoother to the touch, enhancing the overall user experience. Over time, this coating can wear down, so consider its durability when making your decision.

**Installation and Adhesion:** A poorly installed screen protector can lead to air bubbles,dust particles trapped underneath,and reduced touch sensitivity.Opt for screen protectors that come with an ​easy-to-use installation kit, including alignment tools, cleaning wipes, and dust removal stickers. Full-adhesive screen protectors, which use adhesive across​ the entire surface, tend to provide better adhesion ⁤and prevent lifting ​around the edges compared to ‍those that only have adhesive around the perimeter.

**Edge-to-Edge Coverage‍ and Case Compatibility:** The screen protector should ideally cover the entire display of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, extending to the edges without interfering with the front-facing ⁢camera or sensors. it's also crucial to ensure compatibility with your preferred iPhone case. Some screen protectors may be too thick or extend too far to the⁣ edges, causing them to lift or peel off when used with certain cases.

## Core Benefits

Investing‌ in a high-quality​ privacy screen protector offers several tangible benefits ​beyond just protecting your ‌screen.

**Enhanced Privacy:** The primary benefit​ is, of course, enhanced privacy. ⁣A good privacy screen protector effectively blocks the view of onlookers, safeguarding sensitive information such as passwords, financial details, and personal ​messages when‍ using your iPhone in public places like trains, cafes, or airports.⁣ this prevents shoulder surfing and reduces the‌ risk of visual hacking.

**Screen Protection:** Beyond privacy, the screen protector provides a crucial layer of physical protection ⁣against scratches, scuffs, and accidental drops. The 9H hardness rating⁤ of tempered glass shields the display from everyday wear and tear, preserving its pristine condition. while it may not prevent all damage from severe impacts,it considerably reduces the likelihood of a cracked or ‌shattered screen,perhaps saving you hundreds of dollars in repair costs.

**Reduced Eye Strain:** Some privacy screen protectors also incorporate blue light filtering technology, which reduces the amount of harmful blue light emitted from the display. Prolonged exposure to blue light can contribute to eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances. By filtering out ⁢a portion of this ‌blue light, the screen protector can help⁤ reduce eye fatigue and improve sleep quality, particularly for users who spend extended periods using their iPhones.

**Improved Aesthetics:** A well-installed screen protector enhances the‍ visual appearance of your iPhone 16 Pro Max. It creates a smooth, seamless surface‌ that repels fingerprints and smudges, keeping your screen looking clean and⁢ clear. This is particularly‌ important for maintaining the ‍premium look and feel of a flagship device like ‍the ‌iPhone 16 Pro Max.

**Increased resale Value:** By protecting the screen from scratches and damage,⁢ the screen protector helps maintain ​the resale value of your iPhone 16 Pro Max. A pristine display ⁢significantly increases its attractiveness ​to potential buyers, allowing you to command ‍a higher price when you eventually decide to upgrade to a newer model.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the‌ world of privacy screen protectors ‌can raise several ‌questions. Here are some common queries answered.

**Will a privacy screen protector affect the iPhone 16 Pro Max's display quality?**
While all privacy screen protectors introduce some degree of light‌ reduction, high-quality models are designed to minimize the impact on display clarity and color accuracy. Look for screen protectors with high transparency ratings ​and anti-glare coatings to maintain optimal​ viewing⁣ experience. ‍Adjusting your screen brightness can also help compensate for any perceived dimming.

**Does‍ the privacy feature work ‌in all lighting conditions?**
The effectiveness of the privacy feature can vary depending on the ambient lighting. in bright sunlight, the privacy ⁣effect may be less pronounced, while in darker environments,​ it becomes more noticeable. some screen protectors have adjustable privacy levels, ⁤allowing you to fine-tune the viewing angle​ based ‍on your surroundings.

**How‍ do I clean a privacy screen protector?**
Clean your privacy screen protector regularly with a soft,⁤ lint-free microfiber cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the oleophobic coating and reduce the privacy functionality. A slightly damp cloth can be used to remove stubborn fingerprints or ‌smudges.

**Will a privacy screen protector interfere with Face ID?**
Most privacy screen protectors are designed to be compatible with Face ID and other facial recognition systems. However, it's essential to ensure that the screen protector doesn't cover the front-facing​ camera or ⁤sensors, as this can interfere with their functionality.⁣ Check the product specifications for Face ID compatibility before purchasing.

## Competitor Comparison

Let's examine how some‍ hypothetical privacy screen protectors might stack up against each ⁣other:

### product Comparison Overview

#### PrivacyGuard Pro (Hypothetical)
- **Privacy Angle:** 30-degree viewing angle

## Ideal‌ User Profile

Privacy screen protectors are ⁢particularly well-suited for specific user‍ types.

**Traveling Professionals:** Business travelers who frequently work on sensitive ⁤documents or⁢ access confidential information in public spaces like airplanes, trains, or cafes will benefit greatly​ from a ⁣privacy​ screen protector.

Because smart money runs on spreadsheets. They model risks, forecast returns, and move when the data tells them to. Dumb money follows hype, FOMO, and whatever their realtor buddy told them over coffee.

Let’s be honest: realtors love pre-con investors. Why? Because they’re easy to sell to. Many don’t run the numbers, they just hear “low deposit,” “closing in 4 years,” and “prices always go up,” and they’re sold.

My spicy-but-not-too-spicy take: realtors know exactly who they’re targeting. And it’s not institutional investors — it’s retail speculators chasing stories, not strategy.

1jrds43,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jrds43/is_the_basket_at_fault_or_is_the_tamper/,Is the basket at fault or is the tamper?,"I'm still quite a beginner experimenting stuff. And I like to experiment various good gears in general.

My current gear is

* Machine: *DeLonghi Dedica something* (so diameters are 51 mm)
* Grinder: *KINGrinder K6*
* Puck: After trying some cheaper alternatives, I love using *verybarista IMS Precision Puck Diffuser Screen by E&B LAB*
* Habits:
   * I usually like to make larger cups so maybe larger than a usual espresso size.
   * I usually set to grinder between and including 40 to 50.
   * No sugar, no milk please.
* Baskets:
   * First non-bundled/non-random basket I purchased was *H24 ONE - IMS Precision All In One Filter Basket*. I like it but I find it a bit tricky, I feel, like water is coming through extremely fast and unevenly from this basket. I also once grinded ""too fine"" (like grinder set on 15 or 20 or so) and some coffee particles got stuck in it's smaller holes.
   * I then got the *H29C - IMS Precision Convex Filter Basket* . Which is my current favourite.
   * I recently got the *32mm IMS Precision Competition Series Filter Basket 20-25g (probably something like H32)* , which I didn't necessarily fill to the top of its capacity. (measured inner diameter at the very top: between 50 and 51 mm)
* Tamper: A random cheap tamper + WDT set from brand Piymnys Coffee (tamper measured diameter: 50 mm)
* Portafilters: One from brand *Capfei*, in which I have to push quite strong to insert or remove some baskets and one from brand *Morils* which does not have that issue.

**Question:** Today, trying the third basket in this list: the tamper is too large to go inside the basket. Is it something that happens often? Should the tamper be slightly less large? Is it something wrong with the basket? I noticed that it slips more easily into place  in my portafilters than the other baskets, I think if I turn the portafilter upside down, this basket could fall thanks just from the effect of gravity, which may confirm that it's slightly to small?

**Sub-question:** In the beginning, I used to tamper the coffee very tight in the basket. I currently feel like having the coffee flat but not necessarily as tight helps water go through, and my impression was that not pressing as hard brought some improvement. Hence I now don't always use the tamper and just softly press the puck-diffuser on the coffee but not as tight as I used to with the tamper.

1jrdr3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1jrdr3z/antman_4_concept_pitch/,Ant-Man 4 Concept Pitch,"The Basis of this pitch is inspired by the theory that Scott is not where he isn’t meant to be. Kang is a closed chapter but where Scott is / was is still
Ambiguous. I got inspired by the Truman show, inception and the dream walking concept from doctor strange 2. 

Felt that the 4th installment would be perfect if it was set before secret wars as it perfectly sets in so.

I wanted to make it look like Scott was in an another universe where after the events of quantumania the Family gets a change of heart and moral and everyone turns against Scott etc etc. Plot armor is that a nano-virus from the quantum realm affected them except Scott. Which would justify and explain my choice of tone later.

Check it out 

Act 1 : The Cliche Start

Scott Lang is running around the streets of San Francisco with The Beatles’ here comes the sun playing in the background, enjoying his time and everyone around him waving back at him as he is infamous and is regularly active in San Fran like how Spider-Man is in New York. 

He sees a store robbery happen on the way. He grins and then a whole montage of Antman fighting and belittling these robbers is shown and then he gets a free Apple as a gift of appreciation, he is seen walking out to the store to a cafe which seems familiar as the music plays along.
The plan is simple once a week he does a podcast and a vlog it has been 4 weeks since he started so.

He grabs his coffee and donuts from the same guy we saw in quantumania and then he is later showed walking to his house. He enters the hallroom and gazes at the TV covered by a cloth and then greets Hope and Cassie
(who is about to leave for a trip to Pasadena for an ""invite"").

As Cassie leaves Hope asks Scott about his plans for the day after sharing a kiss and asks him about his physiotherapy after exposed to certain levels of radiation through the portal scene in the ending fight of quantumania. 

He replies with a ""yea it’s alright,it has been working out I guess"" and then he explains his plan for the day which consists of taking down minor minuscule villains who have been popping up in the city and so on. Hope replies with ""someone’s been watching neighborhood watch"" humorously both laugh.

Hope leaves the premises and Scott waits for her to leave the driveway. The moment that has been done he walks to the hall room and the tone is a little eerie and weird as Scott stares at the TV after he removes the cloth to reveal a huge cracked open hole and then we focus on his fingers which seems scarred from scratching on something sharp. Implying that there is something wrong here.

Scott gets his phone camera out and starts recording himself in a vlog style format.
He starts doing things out of the ordinary which seem odd like exhausting his suit from pym particles in a way it glitches but then it just malfunctions while talking slack to his ""viewers"" just for him to be sent flying towards the wall due the malfunction.

He goes to Hank Pym’s House for his radiation therapy and Hank asks him how’s he been since the last visit. He ensures it’s alright. 
Then he takes his medications and injectables after being scanned.
Janet also talks about how she relates to the exposure of the quantum realm and adjusting to earth again.

He leaves the premises and gets pizza delivered to his home. Comically he records his pizza ""mukbang"" talking about his experience explaining how after a few days after quantumania he had a lot of problems in his body that made him feel as if he was being dragged towards something and something was being dragged towards him before he could form another concerning thought the doorbell rings and it’s Hope looking worried for a split second but fine very next second.

They both share pizza and finalize discussions about their marriage till they talk themselves to sleep.

Act 2: something’s wrong 

As he sleeps, Scott enters a dream, He goes to the usual cafe but something is strange, people see him and are terrified and surprised and they start screaming Some even leave and then he rushes outside as he hears screams but no one’s screaming. Suddenly a whole horde of people are seen running towards him. He starts running away from them as they scream in terror as something vague seems to be in the background. He is almost crushed by the stampede of the crowd but then he is teleported to a corner of an alley as his vision gets blurry and a white clothed and white skinned entity with a pitch deep voice in an English accent says ""where have you been Scott Lang?"" As he is teleported away in pain and agony. He regains his vision and walks past the alley exit but stops just to see a ""Scott Lang missing"" poster which terrifies him. As he tries to touch it a swarm of ants start covering his hand and then his arm like a symbiote and they cover him entirely and then he wakes up.

Scott wakes up terrified, Hope has already woken up. He brushes his teeth and checks the newspaper just to walk up
To the hall and see a perfectly spotless TV. He asks Hope what happened to the TV and ""has it always been like this?"" She humorously denies his claims of the TV being broken and then he shrugs it off as she leaves. The door closes and it all seems fine until he sees his fingers. They are unharmed. No scratches,no scars.

He vigorously starts puking until he finally stops and noticed an ant in the puke and then he feels a sting on his back and he removes his shirt to reveal a minor 3-4 ant bite cluster nothing too gorey just spots.

then the camera focuses on the medication on the table. He only took one of the two pills. He keeps his mouth shut and experiments with the probability of him not taking or taking the pills In a pattern.

He tries calling up Sam Wilson and whichever avenger is available to his service to help him with something but they’re all busy. 

He goes out and sees a bunch of protestors talk about lies open and truths hidden, they use a slogan called ""show us the real world"" slogan. Scott realized that Luis is also a part of this and he catches up with him and realizes that the last time he didn’t take his medications he saw them and also the The last time before that. He keeps all this patterns in mind and writes them down and records monologues related to this for his ""viewers"".

He takes the last pill and everything goes normally again. He fights robbers, catches up with friends, does his things etc. 

The routine goes on for A whole week and there’s no weirdness for a whole week.

Scott goes for one of his last few check ups for the ""radiation"" therapy and Hank gives some specifications bout how the injectables and pills work and help his arm which has been the most affected.

He goes home and checks his piece of technology to assess his condition more precisely as there’s no major damage. He sees an Ant go inside his monitor but pays no mind. the same routine goes the same but this time he takes neither of the pills nor the injections.

He faints in the middle of the night as he is home alone but instead of ""falling asleep"" he falls into a void looping itself until he genuinely faints. This time he wakes up in a San Francisco that’s withering and his right arm is slightly withered down. This time he has an Ant-Man suit, he fights a group of rebels who demand for his flesh but he subdued them nevertheless then he sees the rubble of downtown San Fran and skeletons but the moment he turns back he is brought back to the same cafe and he sees a semi burned version of the cafe guy who asks him where has he been and  it’s been ages Before Scott could ask more he is seen to be floating possessed mid air levitating in pain as a dark Smokey green mist is surrounding him and the guy dies next to him asks him to save him.

We are shown Scott floating mid air in his room as Hope and is seen rushing towards him forcefully injecting the medications and the two pills followed up. He wakes up and confronts Hope asking her if something has been hidden from him all along and the whole arguement turns rash as Scott‘s paranoia shows out even more.

Hope stops reasoning saying ""this could’ve been easier if you didn’t ask too many questions"" and the next thing shown is hope pushing a button and Scott blacks out.

The entirety of ACT 1 plays again but ACT 2 is as if it’s looped aswelll but perfectly  altered to the point where it fades to 
"" a loop later "" Cue card.

ACT 3: breakthrough

Scott is seen finalizing dates with Hope and The family in the house with Cassie aswell for his final grand wedding. They get interrupted by the news and they see a crime happening. The Antman and Wasp rush to the scene. 

Scott is seen fighting a copycat version of ghost and a bunch of ""technology stealing bandits"" they’re taken care of until one of them injects something into scott’s leg and he starts puking microbots again and then these ""bandits"" look familiar as they are actually the same protestors forgotten about. The last one removes his mask and his disguise and  it’s revealed that it’s Luis and he’s wearing a TVA outfit and he was sent of a mission to retrieve him. As he embraces Scott he is shot from the back and his body slowly falls down to the ground. It is revealed it is Hope who shot him which causes him to scream at her ""why!!!!"" She screams back and asks him to shut up claiming that this all would’ve been easier if he never doubted and she is about to shoot him aswell.

Before she could do anything Hope is seen being shot from the back and instead of blood there’s electricity and blue blood coming out as she is subdued and another Antman but with a more futuristic suit is seen Scott screams and tries to fight him in confusion but this Antman pleads him to stop and he aswell injects more of that injectable anti-venom like thing and Scott starts puking out microbots that move back and forth again. The other ant man claims ""Scott we must leave now, this place isn’t what it seems"" as he grabs the tempad and connects it to his apparatus.

He uses the tempad but realizes they need another major pym particle sample to make the jump to safety . Both of them stare at each other Hope brings herself up  
And in a deeper robotized voice she claims ""two birds one stone, now I’ll be needing both of you"" as they see her have the particle they need they have no option but to fight her.

Hank pym and Janet van dyne come out of nowhere in a Yellowjacket suit with Cassie in a version of it aswell followed by a whole swarm of people who were once dead except the ""technology stealing bandits"".

They all swarm them and start fighting them but Janet sides with the two Antmen and she gets killed in the process.

Both are almost beaten to a pulp but they both stop holding back their punches.
the both end up killing all of them now only hope and Hank are alive brought to near death. Scott asks them ""who really are you guys?"" Before Hope answers she malfunctions and bursts into an explosion.

Hank replies in a sinister tone ""you don’t belong here Scott, but as long as you have it in you, you will never escape from me, from us"" and then he stares at the other ant man and claims ""this one could’ve been more useful if he didn’t run away from us, too bad you are all we need"" as he grabs and locks his arm to a machine that starts extracting his blood.

The other Antman regains himself and goes micro to stop the motors from working and then he resizes and slashes Scott’s arm off and kills the evil version of Hank.

Scott is in shock and is in pain but he sees his arm wither and then slowly turn into a ant arm like shape with a metallic color and an injured and reasoned with Cassie is seen ripping the arm in half and using it to start fighting.

The Antman and Scott start walking towards her but she isn’t gonna listen. The fellow ant man says ""she’s gone now you’re better off not knowing who she really is now."" Scott asks him ""how do you know this?"" But the other Antman focuses on the fight instead and they both work on subduing Cassie instead of killing her. After a very vigorous fight. Cassie is defeated but not until she slashes the fellow ant man’s stomach and he is left bleeding and then something takes control of Scott and he loses his consciousness for a split second just for an electric blue blooded Cassie is shutting down infront of him.

The other Antman says ""it had to be done"" as he drags himself and cries to himself.  The other Scott claims ""this was my universe, I was meant to be here but after quantum realm something changed in all of them their therapy was a lie, it was a conversion.""

Scott grabs him with his only one arm to check on him and asks him how did he find him.

The Antman says ""you puked me out, you couldn’t see that coming?"" And the gets a flashback of everything he saw an ant around his house and he realizes what broke his loops constantly. 

The Antman mentions the ""vlogs"" in a mocking manner and he realizes who the ""viewer"" really was.

He thanks him and tells him this won’t be in vain as he cries to himself looking at the devastation and trauma caused at the scene.

The other Antman frankly tells him ""you don’t belong here, we switched places.
Your universe needs you.
This isn’t your universe Scott""

Scott is terrified and shocked as he realizes whatever doubt he ever had was right and he has always been right bout it all along and something had been keeping him here all along.

The other ant man says “yea about that I sense that something took care of that"" and as he is struggling to gain himself he gives his mechanical arm to him which is shaped like an mechanical ant hand. Scott realizes that his blood isn’t red it is rather greenish.

He opens his mask just to see an ant’s face and hey says ""look out for the big guy"" as he laughs and opens a portal/tear in reality for him before the universe collapses. The last thing he tells him is ""I’ve lost my world you still have a time, this is an incursion. Warn them of this. Warn them of everything that will happen."" 

The life fades off his eyes as the whole world around him starts fading away in light. Scott rushes and makes out of the portal in time as he takes the tempad and equipment from that antman.

He faints as he is exhausted. He is woken up by the sight of biomechanic pair of eyes staring at him.

As he wakes up and rushes up to stand he sees an almost torn White Vision, star lord  and some of the  west coast avengers waking Scott up but he sees the destruction and realizes it’s too late.

He is escorted to him house to find Janet Van Dyne dead, Hank pym injured and Hope in a beaten down suit

He asks ""where’s Cassie?"" As he cries to the sight of this and vision ensures she is safe with trusted people (young avengers).

He gets to call her from someone else’s phone and he cries hearing her voice as she implies he has been gone missing for a very long time. He hangs up and looks at the sight of the skyline getting destroyed. 

The last words he says are ""It’s way too late"" as a green force destroys a huge skyscraper in the distance from the window.

The End.

1jrdo2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1jrdo2u/parents_friends/,Parent’s Friends,"Tell me about your BPD parent’s friends. 

First off, I’ll briefly say my dad’s friend group is long standing and cult-like. It is also part of his dating and affair pool. It’s a flock of flying monkeys and enabling women. I am sure he is uNPD and I have been no contact for a decade. 

The stuff I want to focus on in this post is more about my mom. I know that often times moms with BPD have very tumultuous friendships, or none at all. What I’ve found with my mom is that in many ways she has none at all. My myself and my grandma are who she considers her people. She talks to my grandma for hours every day and has my whole life. But also she hordes people (and things) and keeps them on ice indefinitely until she needs them. 

Here are some examples:

Her childhood best friend: they grew up in the same neighborhood and school for the majority of their childhood in the 60s and 70s. They really have nothing in common. My mom is waify and her friend is outgoing. My mom doesn’t seem to really like her, but will spend time with her when she’s lonely and her friend invites her to something. Her friend normally invites here to MLM parties masked as other things, even though my mom says she hates it and has asked her friend for decades not to leave out the MLM info when inviting her. But she still goes and it still happens. Her childhood best friend also goes through scary diet fads and is pretty against much in modern medicine. My mom is living with cancer, so this is going to get awkward one day. I once told my mom that her old best friend needs to know boundaries when it comes to this, because she was posting anti-science cancer stuff and my mom thought it would be great if I reached out to her old friend to advocate on her behalf. I did not. 

Her former ballroom dance instructor: This guy has been around since I was in college. He used to be an attractive, Disney Prince looking guy that learned dance from his pro mom, played football and then worked on cruise ships as a dancer, before becoming a dance instructor in the Midwest. At least that’s his story. As I type it out it reminds me too much of Patrick Swayze to really be true. Anyway, now he is an aging, shifty, greasy bum. I don’t say that to be mean. It’s just the actual presence he gives off. He just started acting school (on my mom’s dime) and they even told his that. Whenever she is feeling lonely and abandoned by me (like when I went to college, when I got my own place in my mid-twenties and now that I’m not in my hometown anymore) he pops back into her life. He hasn’t been a ballroom dance instructor in over a decade now. Instead he’s really become a grease ball that lives with and drains his girlfriend (and former dance student’s) time and money. He has a pattern with his former students, specifically his girlfriend and my mom. He has made it very clear to both his girlfriend and my mom that my mom would have been the more preferable option, but she’s the only one of his students that ever said no to sex on their ballroom dancing competition trips. So they have a strange decades long love triangle where she and the other women play power games and he tolerates it for the resources he needs to survive. I don’t think his girlfriend is mentally well either. They all act like friends and will occasionally have dinner together, like at my mom’s house. She actually hosts them. She hasn’t been in an official romantic relationship since I was in middle school. This seems to sustain what she needs to feel flattered. She has helped him financially, but always acts like it’s moral, because it isn’t a secret and always comes with a catch that she thinks is helping to develop him as a person. But his girlfriend isn’t really given many options but to go along with it all. Also, this guy has always said strange things about my husband. How cool he is and how he wishes he was him. Creeps me out. 

Little note on her love life. Her first husband was a biker that robbed a DMV and his best friend killed a sheriff in the shoot out that happened during all of that (just found this little gem out last year), her second husband (my dad) has uNPD and stalker issues to this day. Her boyfriend when she divorced my dad was a guy with addiction issues that she met in AA/NA who is constantly in and out of jail and on the streets. The ex-boyfriend still sometimes pops up, I’m sure for money, and she finds it flattering. She thinks she’s just too hard to let go of, when really it’s bad boundaries.

The Replacement: There is always a spot for what I gather is my replacement. Sometimes it’s a kid in the CASA program. Once it was a homeless woman she met at her regular coffee shop that she used to support, until she died on the streets due to a long standing lung condition mixed with mental illness. Often it’s a man or woman from her high school days. She rarely makes new friendships. Currently there is a very overbearing friend from high school that moved back to our hometown a few years ago and the two of them really latched on to each other. In someways I’m always grateful for the person that takes on this role. But they always have significant issues and this current friend is an absolute control freak. She calls it having “big sister syndrome.” Even though she was the youngest in her family. Really it’s just an excuse to be overbearing. She’s even tried to dream up and force a new (old) life in my hometown on me and my husband before, without considering our happiness or life in our current community at all. Only my mom’s desires. 

I would love to hear about your parent’s friendship patterns. Wondering if this are common and if I’ve missed any with my parents that are in appropriate. 

Oh! One last one I will mention. Inappropriate friendships with my friends and former boyfriends (my mom) and crossing boundaries with my friend’s mothers (my dad). ",1,1743778012.0,raisedbyborderlines,0,1.0,False

1jrdmjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1jrdmjx/warning_things_that_actually_do_interfere_with/,Warning: Things that actually do interfere with Vyvance absorbtion  vitamin C.,"I was noticeing that my days on vyvance were all very different from each other. Some of that is just baseline ADHD dis-regulation but it did seem oddly connected to a few things. If I took my daily vitamin it seemed like I had all the negative side effects of vyvance but none of the focus or clarity of thought. I started taking my vitamin in the afternoon because I realized it seemed to ""work better."" Then I realized that when I forgot my vitamin all together fir the day the vyvance seemed to last longer and my day wss better. I was curious so I researched what vitamins could interfere with vyvance absorbtion and there it was... vitamin C, citric acid, citrus acid, anything acidic. This includes many herbal teas, coffee, decaf coffee, almost all sugar free drinks and almost all electrolyte drinks. Orange juice, fruit, and berries as well. As far as beverages go that leaves plain water, coconut water, plain water with salt in it lol. I don't know if this is always an issue for everyone so please listen to your own body and needs. The reason I think this is important is because the difference of mixing vyvance with vitamin C and ascorbic acid was so noticable it was ruining my day. This stuff is expensive I want it to work. My doctor may have even mentioned avoiding orange juice and vitamins in the morning but I didn't get the impression of how important it could be and didn't remember. I also noticed that for myself If I skip eating anything until after noon or even 2pm it seems to absorb much better and last longer.(I am overweight so not worried about calorie intake. Vyvance has lead to 15lbs of weight gain for me.) I may simply be very sensative to anything that could interfere with vyvance. In order to have a consistent and effective experience I find I have to stick to plain water and nothiing else until the afternoon. The difference is very noteable and provudes consistency. If anyone has any sugar free and non ascorbic acid electrolyte drink reccomendations please let me know! I can't find any with flavor. ",1,1743777909.0,VyvanseADHD,0,0.67,False

We have never had a court ordered agreement, but after last night I am thinking it might be time. To be honest, it was probably time 5 years ago but I have been too scared of the conflict a potential court case would bring to my daughter's life. We have close to 50/50 custody with her staying with me 4 nights a week, and 3 with her father, he watches her in the morning before pre-k while i am working as well. 

The issue at hand right now, is that every few months he will go off the handle and send me upwards of 20 texts, or last night he sent me 13 five minute videos in the course of two hours. The videos consisted of him belittling me, making comments about how I dress, my work schedule, my hair style, my religious beliefs and down to the coffee I get in the morning. 

  
These videos clearly show his mental instability and his issue with alcohol. I am worried about what my child witnesses or how he speaks to her while she is with him.

I have been going into the office extra early so that I could get off early for some family events. Because of this I decided to stop at the coffee shop yesterday to get a coffee with a sugar free syrup added to it for some flavor. When I got to work, 30 minutes later, my CGM showed that my glucose had spiked. The only thing I had was the coffee. 

The coffee shop doesn’t have extremely detailed nutrition information on their site. Recently, I had asked about another flavor syrup and it was 0 carbs, so I had figured this flavor couldn’t add many if any carbs to the drink. Fast forward to today. I visited the coffee shop again and had the courage to ask them what the carbs were on new flavor. They told me 25 carbs, and my jaw hit the floor.

So a huge shout out to my CGM for showing me what was really happening. I might have continued on drinking hidden carbs if I didn’t have one.

On occassion, I have woken him up after his 10 alarms have gone off in the morning and he decides to go back to sleep. I sometimes get up at the same time for work, and I'm too busy getting ready myself to check if he's gotten up. Most times, he eventually gets up on his own (although sometimes late) and I don't have to think about it. A few mornings ago however, we both had to get up at the same time, I got up said good morning and kissed him and he smiled and said good morning. So, one would think, he's awake.. I was gravely mistaken. I did my usual morning routine and popped into the shower, blow dried my hair and started doing my makeup. I go to start my morning coffee and noticed he was still in bed, to which he angrily asked why I didn't make sure he was up. I was incredibly frustrated, and replied ""I thought you were up? I didn't exactly have time to check as I was showering and getting ready myself"". He decided to reply to my statement by swearing at me and calling me names, that I should have noticed he wasn't up. I told him that I wasn't his mother, and he wasn't my son, that it's not my responsibility to make sure he's up on time for work. He mumbled something under his breath, which I assumed was just some nasty response. He got ready and headed out for work without another word, a kiss or a hug goodbye. Am I the asshole for not waking my husband up? He's been short with me ever since.",291,1743777356.0,AmItheAsshole,98,0.93,False

Short Devotional about Generosity

Introduction
------------

Generosity is like a refreshing breeze that can lift our spirits and transform our lives. It’s the joyful act of extending kindness and sharing our blessings with others. Whether it’s offering a helping hand, giving a heartfelt compliment, or sharing resources, generosity breathes life into our relationships and communities. Let’s journey together to discover how embracing generosity can lead us to deeper fulfillment and greater joy.

Imagine a world where generosity is the norm—a place where people give freely, without expectation, and where acts of kindness create ripples of positivity that touch countless lives. This isn’t just a dream; it’s a reality we can build together. Let’s dive into this devotional and uncover how generosity, guided by the teachings of the Bible, can enrich our lives and the lives of those around us.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” — Luke 6:38 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This powerful verse from the Gospel of Luke offers profound insights into the spiritual principle of generosity. Jesus speaks of giving as a conduit for receiving blessings. The imagery of a measure “pressed down, shaken together and running over” illustrates the abundance we can experience when we give freely and generously. Our acts of giving, large or small, have the potential to overflow, blessing us in return.

Generosity goes beyond material gifts; it’s about the heart’s inclination to see and meet the needs of others. It’s about extending grace, love, and compassion to those around us. When we give, we reflect God’s character, inviting divine overflow into our lives. Our generosity mirrors God’s generosity, transforming both the giver and the receiver.

The principle here is simple yet profound—it teaches us that with the same measure we offer to others, so too shall we receive. This encourages us to cultivate a lifestyle of intentional generosity, knowing that our acts of kindness contribute to a cycle of blessing and fulfillment.

Generosity also shapes our hearts and perspectives. It shifts our focus from scarcity to abundance, from self-centeredness to selflessness. By practicing generosity, we become conduits of God’s love and grace, bringing hope and encouragement to others. It’s a powerful tool for building stronger, more connected communities.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Practice daily gratitude by acknowledging the blessings in your life and sharing them with others.

– Dedicate time each week to volunteer or help someone in need, whether in your community or within your social circle.

– Start a generosity jar, and consistently contribute to it. When it fills, use the funds to bless someone unexpectedly.

– Make it a habit to speak kind words and offer genuine encouragement to the people around you.

– Reflect on areas of your life where you might hoard resources and commit to sharing more freely.

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank you for the abundant blessings You’ve poured into my life. Help me to be a channel of Your love and generosity to those around me. Teach me to give freely, just as You have given freely to me. Open my eyes to the needs of others and soften my heart to respond with compassion. May my acts of generosity reflect Your goodness and draw me closer to You. Amen.

Had a small latte and a chocolate Easter cake. 

Pre-mounjaro I would have inhaled it so fast that I wouldn’t even have had time to taste it. Today I took 2 bites of the cake.. not very nice. The coffee was too milky and not hot enough so I didn’t want it. 

In a weird way this is brilliant because I just didn’t feel bothered about eating it. Before.. I’d eat it anyway, still be hungry and also annoyed at myself for eating junk. 

I’m due for my jab tonight so my hunger is back today and even though I thought it had worn off for the week.. I was able to just put that food to one side without any willpower. 

I have *always* struggled with this compulsion to eat crap until mounjaro. But now it’s basically just gone away.

It’s a perfect example of what Bill Maher calls “Negative improvement.” They take something perfectly good as it is and add features that make it worse. In this case, you connect a dishwasher to the cloud.

A dishwasher. The thing that washes your dishes. You must create an account, give them your information, and connect to their server. So on your end, you have the inconvenience and security risk, and on their end, they have to pay for the space, machines, and people to run servers and keep them updated, upgraded, and maintained *forever* because if the servers are down for any reason, whether it’s a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or any financial problem at any link in the chain, it won’t work. So it’s inevitable that we, the consumers, will have to pay a subscription at some point and that the service will not last until the sun burns out. And obviously, if someone hacks your dishwasher to commit identity theft, no executive at Bosch is going to jail

All of this is part of a relentless invasion of our privacy from corporations intent on exploiting and commodifying our time and energy. Where once we had ""third places"" like coffee houses and Elk’s lodges to relax after work and build communities, now we’re getting text messages on our vacuums.

And it goes without saying that these machines will break because as expensive as they are, they’re cheap in the ways that count, so it’s only a matter of time before some rubber band breaks or some circuit gets fried and it’s cheaper to replace the whole thing than get it fixed.

You’ve stuck with me this long, now comes the payoff: People are fucking sick of this shit. And that is going to create a demand for dum appliances. We chuckle at how in the original The Fast and The Furious, the gang steals a truck full of CRT TVs and VCRs, but those old televisions are creeping up in value. There is going to be a market for well-made, not connected appliances that, like Terry Pratchet’s boots, will last for decades.  And the only way to get that is, hilariously, small batch productions similar to the way we have local breweries.

The seller also has the SSP  MP, but was very kind and patient suggesting to me that the LVS3 will do fine for my case taste profiles (espresso taste profile sweetness and lil bit of clarity) , and offered me that if I purchase it with the LSV3, he will give me 2 weeks to try it if it is not to my liking he will exchanged the LSV3 to MP

So I proceed to purchase it and got it yesterday, found out it has lot of ground coffee on it, so I give it some cleaning (when he sent it to me, he told me to check the allignment of the burrs) I opened and cleaned the burrs, but once I checked the screws (Torx screws ) holding the burrs I can see that they were little bit damaged, I have not the right tools to check if they can be unscrewed for now, but saw before a post that once the screws are damaged they can be hard to unscrew without proper tools,  
Should I be worried ?

I contacted the seller about this, and he said that he has no issue with the screws like that and that he was able to swap the burrs before. I still have 2 days left to verify and confirm the grinder is as described in the plateform where I purchased it from

Sorry for the long post, and Thank you all in advance.
