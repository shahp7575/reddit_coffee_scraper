1odpqwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1odpqwr/leasing_team_had_my_car_towed_even_though_i_pay/,Leasing team had my car towed even though I pay for a permit,"I moved into my apartment weeks after it opened and only 30% of the apartments were occupied. There are three 5 story buildings and a small, uncovered, surface level parking lot, a two story garage (covered lower level + one uncovered upper level) available to residents and guests to park in. There are also a number of street parking spots across the street from the complex to park in. All of these parking areas are very small and have about 40-50 spots each. When I moved in, I purchased an uncovered parking pass and it took about 6 months, but eventually every single spot in the vicinity was taken up by 5pm except for the covered garage parking. I got on the covered garage parking ""waiting list"" in October 2024 because there are consistently zero spaces to park in. Even our handicapped spaces will be parked in by non handicapped residents because there are no spaces. I get charged $75/month for my uncovered parking space but often have to park at the RTD station a quarter mile away from my building because there are no spots even on the street by the time I get home. I had previously had a tag on my car that scanned me into the upper garage area but had to get a new windshield and my leasing office told me it would be $75 to replace and the manager at the time told me to just park on the surface level when I can to avoid the fee.

We get a new leasing team every 2-3 months and got a new team 3 weeks ago. There is also a coffee shop moving into a retail spot in one of the buildings. The new team has been sending emails notifying residents that the spaces in front of the coffee shop will be for their customers only. The coffee shop is still under construction. Last week, I ran into the owner of the shop (who was parked in a fire lane at the time) who followed me from the parking lot to tell me she would have my car towed because the surface lot is for coffee shop customers. I asked her if the shop was open and she said it would be opening in just a few days...... So I walked into the leasing office and asked them where I can park if not in the parking lot I pay to park in. The girl turned completely red faced and said I can park in the street or pay $100 to park in the garage while they figure out assigned parking spaces for residents. She was definitely rude, which I didn't really care about at the time, but this does apply later. Mind you there are about 50 street parking spaces, all at least 2 blocks from my building and I'm still being charged to park in the parking lot. So the leasing team is still ""figuring out"" assigned parking, an entire parking lot has been removed from our already too scarce parking spaces, and we can't park in the surface lot because a coffee shop will be expecting customers on an unknown, but ""soon"", future date. I asked this to the girl in the office and she teared up and told me if I would just let her finish speaking she could give me a solution. I said ""okay go ahead"" and she said ""I wish there something I can do but there's not. It's just the rules."" She has to be no older than 20 years old but this was the strangest interaction I've ever had with a leasing employee.

I've been needing a replacement key fob for 2 weeks because we lost one of ours. I told someone in the office 10 days ago and she said as soon as the PM was back in she would give me a call to come get my key. Nothing. I went in the next day. Same thing. ""The PM just stepped out but as soon as he's back we'll make that key and I'll call you."" Next day the same thing. So I just thought I'd give them a few days but they kept making it seem like this is a 60 second task so I'm not sure why I don't have a replacement yet. I went back 4 days later and asked if I could get the key yet. The PM once again wasn't there and they would let him know as soon as he was back and he would get that made. I still haven't heard anything so I called this morning and asked. The person who answered said the PM was there and would make the key. 6 hours later, I went to run some errands and came back home, parked in a future resident spot right in front of the leasing office, and walked in and asked if I can get the key. The 20 year old who I talked to about the parking said it would be a $75 charge. I was shocked after asking so many times that it would take this long to be told about the charge. Anyway, I said I'll just think about it and give them a call. As I walked out the door, I watched the girl watch me walk to my car, then linger and stare at me while I pulled out and re-parked at the furthest point away from the still under construction coffee shop in the surface level parking lot where there are no coffee shop parking signs and the sign in front of the space had my apartment's logo on it. 15 minutes later my car was towed. There are 30 cars between the entrance of the parking lot and where my car was parked. Resident cars. There are even cars still parked in the spaces that have the coffee shop parking signs in front of them. Only my car was towed.

I went to the towing company to get my car back and asked why my car was towed. The woman told me it was because I don't have a parking pass, which I do. I asked who called my car in and that I thought it was someone from my leasing office who doesn't like me. She looked at her computer screen and gave me a very exaggerated nod YES and widened her eyes at me as if to say ""that's correct"" while saying ""I can't actually tell you who called, just that it was an authorized person."" and continued nodding yes and giving me wide eyes. She said most apartment complexes have a system where they can look up if a car has a permit, but because my complex doesn't have that and also doesn't give out physical permits they just have to take their word for it. This is true. We don't have physical permits, we just get charged a parking fee.

My fiancé went to the leasing office and asked why they called to get my car towed when there are other cars in the lot, even cars parked in front of the soon-to-be coffee shop and both the young girl and the other woman in the office vehemently denied calling the towing company and agreed it was weird that my car was towed. What can I do about this? I had to pay to get my car back after the tow but I want to be reimbursed for this because I already pay to park. I also want to report the girl that I'm pretty certain called my car in. I don't know if there's anything I can do without definitive proof but I'd say the confirmation from the woman at the towing company pushes this beyond reasonable doubt. I could call the PM directly but, after reading my apartment's reviews today, I'm pretty sure he spends all of his time responding in paragraphs to ex tenants who leave bad reviews and writing obviously fake good reviews specifically naming himself. Also this girl is clearly retaliatory so I don't really want to complain more to her direct team. I looked up the leasing company and all I can find are phone numbers from their offices in other states so I'm not sure which phone number would get me in contact with higher ups to report to.",1,1761180770.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

I (33/M) agree with her, are we overreacting?","My girlfriend and I like reading this subreddit together, kind of a guilty pleasure while we have coffee or wind down at night. But lately, she’s gotten really cynical about it. She keeps saying stuff like, ""There’s no way any of these stories are real."" And honestly, I’ve started to agree with her. Every other post is like:

> ""My [22F] boyfriend [23M] of 8 years cheated on me with my twin sister while my parents watched and clapped.""

Even as I write this, the peak post is about a dude claiming his best man stole his wife and is now trying to get with his girlfriend. It's ridiculous. Everything is just so over the top. Even the ones that sound plausible eventually turn into wild plot twists or perfect Reddit moral lessons.

Don’t get me wrong, I know relationship drama can get weird and people absolutely do crazy stuff. But the sheer volume of posts that read like short stories or screenplays makes it hard to believe they’re all genuine. We started calling it ""creative writing hour."" Half the time we try to guess which ones were written by ChatGPT or some bored person farming karma.

Now I’m wondering if we’re being too cynical. Are we missing the point? Is the entertainment value the whole idea, regardless of truth? Or are we right to be skeptical that 99% of these posts are exaggerated or outright fake?

Curious if anyone else feels the same way or if we’re just jaded internet fossils at this point. Bonus points if you can figure out if this was written by ChudGPT.",3,1761180744.0,relationship_advice,4,0.71,False

1odpn17,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1odpn17/accosted_by_a_crazy_boomer_outside_starbucks/,Accosted by a crazy Boomer outside Starbucks,"Yesterday, I took my son to his once-a-week math tutoring. The neighborhood where his tutor lives is next to a shopping center, and I go do work at the Starbucks until it’s time to pick him up. Usually it’s quiet and uneventful. People popping in to pick up mobile orders. Occasionally this nice homeless guy who keeps to himself. It’s a small store. Just three tables.

I walk in and there’s a well-dressed woman at the counter with a big purse talking to the barista. Something seems a little off, but I get in line behind her. I hear some of what she’s saying and I think she caught her man cheating. She’s obviously distraught and not in her right mind. (And he has terrible painted-on eyebrows.)

The barista turns to help me … I just get a cookie for my son. The woman asks if I heard what she told the barista. I tell her no, that I just walked up there. She’s harassing the barista about plugging in her phone at the register.

I ask her what she needs, because it looks like she’s trying to pay for something with her phone, which is dead. I was going to buy her a coffee if she needed it.

“I need a ride,” she says.

I don’t give rides to strangers, especially not crazy ones, so I tell her I can’t because my son is at tutoring and I need to stay close by. Then I go to a table. She goes off on the barista, who looks terrified, and calls her a bitch because she hadn’t plugged in the phone. To try to diffuse it, I point her to an outlet with a built-in USB port. She has no idea what I’m talking about. Things seem to be getting tense so I walk out toward my car. She comes out of the store behind me, as I’m walking toward my car, yelling at me, calling me a “fucking liar” at the top of her lungs. Then she walks off. 

I’ve got work to do, and I need internet, so I walk back toward Starbucks because I think she’s gone. She’s shows back up as I’m about to go in, yelling at me again, calling me a “fucking liar” and saying that I don’t have a kid in tutoring. I decide not to go in because those poor Starbucks workers don’t need any more of her shit. I turn to go back to my car and she continues to yell at me, walking through the parking lot, calling me a “fucking liar” over and over. 

Remember I had never laid eyes on this woman until a few minutes earlier.

I get in my car and leave, parking at the far end of the lot (it’s a big, busy shopping center). If the cops showed, I wanted to be there. They didn’t. She just went next door to Tropical Smoothie Cafe and sat there for a while, bothering them. 

Part of me wishes I had done more than just walk away. But she was crazy, and I was legit worried she had a weapon in that giant bag of hers. The whole thing was just so unsettling.",1,1761180468.0,BoomersBeingFools,1,1.0,False

1odplcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTPrelationshipLab/comments/1odplcl/my_esfj_roommate_hates_me/,My ESFJ roommate HATES me.,"My roommate started dating an ESFJ back in February, and it’s been the most mentally draining experience I’ve ever had to endure. On the surface, he’s the perfect guy. Polite, friendly, helpful, and always “caring about everyone.” But the more you live around him, the more you realize it’s not about kindness. It’s about control and image.

He inserts himself into everything that doesn’t concern him. My space, my habits, even my peace of mind. Nothing is really mine anymore. He treats my privacy like it’s a behavior to be corrected, not a boundary to be respected.

He hides it all under this “I’m just trying to help” act. To everyone else, he’s the dependable, responsible one. But behind closed doors, he’s condescending, manipulative, and emotionally volatile. And when I finally start setting boundaries, I instantly become the “inconsiderate” one.

He fixates on the tiniest, most meaningless “offenses.” A single spinach leaf on the counter, a coffee bottle left out for an hour, a pan soaking in the sink, each one turns into a moral crisis. He doesn’t just see a small mess; he sees a personal attack. He turns harmless details into proof that I’m “disrespectful.” Every nitpick is another way to assert dominance.

I just want to live peacefully and independently. But he’s decided that my introversion and need for space make me “antisocial” and my occasional mess makes me a “slob.” In his mind, I’m something that needs to be fixed. With him, everything becomes emotional and personal. My quietness is “rudeness.” My privacy is “suspicious.” My independence is “disrespect.” He takes my need for solitude like I'm rejecting him. My boundaries are insults to him.

He's a hypocrite when it comes to ""consideration."" He’s obsessed with the idea that if I just lived his way, I’d somehow become a “better” person. I’m not broken.

Introverts don’t need to be outgoing.
People aren’t slobs just because they aren’t organized.
If someone is weird, they don’t have a mental disorder.

I don’t need to be fixed. Respect it or don't.

1odpi7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaExpress/comments/1odpi7r/65_of_consumers_are_using_voice_searchheres_why/,65% of Consumers Are Using Voice Search—Here's Why Your Business Needs to Adapt NOW,"The way people search has fundamentally changed, and most small businesses haven't caught up yet.

Over 65% of consumers now use voice assistants to find local businesses and make purchases. ""Google"" isn't a verb anymore—""Hey Alexa, find me a coffee shop near me"" is.

**Here's the problem:** Voice searches are completely different from typed searches. People speak in conversational, question-based language. Instead of typing ""best plumber Portland,"" they say, ""How do I find a reliable plumber near me?""

**What You Need to Do:**

* **Create FAQ-style content** that answers the actual questions people ask. Think: ""How do I...?"" and ""What's the best...?""
* **Optimize for local voice search.** Include neighborhood names, landmarks, and ""near me"" phrasing naturally in your content.
* **Target featured snippets.** Voice assistants read these first. Position zero is everything now.
* **For retailers:** Voice commerce is real. Simple, voice-optimized product descriptions matter. Think about what people can buy without seeing it.

**Local Business Owners:** This is your golden ticket. A well-optimized voice presence can drive serious foot traffic and appointments. We're talking 40%+ improvement in some categories.

The businesses winning in 2025 aren't the ones with the most significant ad budgets—they're the ones who understood that search is now a conversation, not a query.

Admits the fall out was from Gerard getting sober and Bert still wanting to party with alcohol. Currently they and MCR have 'bumped into each other' a few times ( probably at WWWY fest) and have spoken to eachother, labels them as brilliant guys, which seems to be what everyone says about MCR is theyre so kind and sweet. Bert has also said ' 'take us out on tour My Chem, i dare you''. Goes onto say that they are ready whenever they want us.

What can I do about this? I had to pay to get my car back after the tow but I want to be reimbursed for this because I already pay to park. I also want to report the girl that I'm pretty certain called my car in. I don't know if there's anything I can do without definitive proof but I'd say the confirmation from the woman at the towing company pushes this beyond reasonable doubt. I could call the PM directly but, after reading my apartment's reviews today, I'm pretty sure he spends all of his time responding in paragraphs to ex tenants who leave bad reviews and writing obviously fake good reviews specifically naming himself. Also this girl is clearly retaliatory so I don't really want to complain more to her direct team. I looked up the leasing company and all I can find are phone numbers from their offices in other states so I'm not sure which phone number would get me in contact with higher ups to report to.

1odpge5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmptyContinents/comments/1odpge5/part_7_silent_quarter/,Part 7: Silent Quarter,"Date: June 25 – August 4, 2029

The months following the Null Zone ceasefire were tense, humid, and heavy with silence. Temporary camps sprawled across Pag-asa and nearby reefs, built from scavenged shipping containers, tarpaulin, driftwood, and the broken bones of old ships. The smell of diesel, rust, and brine hung over everything. Even the sea seemed restless, its currents swirling with debris and plankton blooms that glowed faintly at night.

The war had stopped, but the struggle hadn’t.

By day, the sun scorched every surface white. By night, lightning danced over the horizon like distant artillery fire. Men and women lived in that rhythm — wake, repair, patrol, rest — though no one ever really slept well. Radios crackled with incomplete transmissions; every faint signal could mean either a friend or an old ghost.

Then, one morning, a silhouette appeared on the southern horizon — a familiar but forgotten shape cutting slowly through the haze.

The CCG cutter, the same vessel that had defected to Hainan months earlier, was limping home. Its engines sputtered like dying lungs. The paint on its hull had peeled away in wide, salt-bitten streaks. And when it finally dropped anchor off Pag-asa, its crew stood in silence, thin, bearded, and wary.

For hours, nobody approached. The Filipino patrol crews watched through binoculars from their sandbag emplacements, whispering among themselves.

“You think they came back to switch sides again?” a marine muttered.

“If they wanted to shoot, they’d have done it already,” replied Ensign Villanueva, though he didn’t sound convinced.

At dusk, the cutter’s captain — Liu Jian — stepped onto the pier under escort. His uniform was faded, his boots worn thin. He saluted stiffly.

“We’re not enemies anymore,” Liu said. “We’re just survivors trying to find fuel.”

No one spoke for a moment. Then Sergeant Ramirez broke the silence.

“We’ll give you water and food,” he said. “But you follow our patrol routes, and your guns stay cold.”

Liu nodded once. “Fair terms.”

That night, supplies were exchanged carefully — barrels of water, boxes of rice, spare engine parts traded for weather data and maps. The crews didn’t mingle; they stared from separate mess tents lit by flickering lamps. Yet under that uneasy peace, something human began to flicker again — the small gestures that made life bearable: a shared cigarette, a half-smile, a nod of thanks.


By early July, the fragile network of cooperation had taken root. Patrols through the Spratly corridor became semi-regular again, though every mission felt like threading a needle through reefs and mistrust. The returning cutter joined the Filipino flotilla, forming convoys that moved like wounded schools of fish — cautious, synchronized, and aware of every shadow.

Each vessel bore scars. Weld marks ran like veins along the hulls, patched by scavenged metal from sunken trawlers. Inside, engines groaned, leaking oil that mixed with seawater in the bilge. The sound of tools striking steel became a constant hymn.

During one refueling operation, a Chinese mechanic, Zhao Ming, cursed as the pump jammed.

Zhao: “Your filters are clogged again!”

Corporal Alonzo: “Because your damn hose leaks. Hold it steady or we’ll lose another barrel.”

For a moment it seemed like a fight would break out — but then both men burst out laughing when the hose slipped and sprayed them with seawater.

Zhao (grinning): “Maybe the sea just wants its share.”

Alonzo: “Then tell the sea to pay the fuel bill.”

Small moments like that slowly chipped away at months of suspicion.


Still, not every day passed peacefully. Equipment failed, tempers rose, and the weather turned cruel without warning.

On July 10, a squall hit one convoy mid-patrol. The wind screamed through the reefs, tossing small boats like paper toys. Radar went dark, and the crews were forced to rely on hand signals through sheets of rain. Ensign Villanueva remembered shouting orders that were swallowed by the storm.

“Cut engines to half! Keep formation tight—tight!”

When the weather cleared, two cutters had drifted kilometers off course, their fuel nearly depleted. They limped back to Pag-asa at dawn, battered but alive.

The following morning, Lieutenant Chen Wei gathered the officers under a patch of shade made from torn tarpaulin.

Chen Wei: “We survived because we trusted each other’s signals. That’s how it must stay. No one out here wins alone.”

No one disagreed.


By mid-July, the joint patrols had developed a quiet rhythm — the kind that only forms when exhaustion becomes routine. Radios transmitted brief check-ins; coded light signals were used at night to conserve batteries. Shared charts were updated with every patrol, marking dangerous shoals, coral heads, and sunken wrecks.

Supplies remained dangerously low. Fuel convoys from Palawan were delayed, forcing rationing across all posts. Meals shrank to half portions: rice mixed with seawater to stretch flavor, instant noodles divided among three. And still, the patrols continued.

The men began to call it “The Silent Quarter.”

Because for all the tension, the months were defined by a strange quiet — the sound of engines humming under gray skies, the echo of hammer strikes, and the whisper of wind through makeshift antenna towers.


One night, in the dim blue light of a ship’s cabin, Villanueva found himself sharing coffee with Captain Liu.

Villanueva: “When you left for Hainan… did you think you’d come back here?”

Liu: (quietly) “I thought we’d find order there. But there was nothing — only confusion and fear. Out here, at least, the sea still answers honestly.”

Villanueva nodded, staring at the waves slapping against the hull.

Villanueva: “Maybe that’s all we have left — honesty and saltwater.”

They both laughed softly.

That same week, the crews began repainting the rusted cutter hulls with whatever leftover paint they could find — white, blue, gray — transforming the ships into patchwork symbols of survival. The gesture wasn’t official, but everyone seemed to understand its meaning: this fleet, however temporary, belonged to no single flag anymore.


By August 3, the logs began to show consistency for the first time in months. Patrol routes stabilized. Communications improved slightly.

Villanueva’s Log:
“Convoy through Spratly corridor completed without incident. Morale fragile but improving. Joint operations sustained for 42 consecutive days. Cooperation grounded in necessity, not trust — but it works.”

The sun dipped low that evening, casting the sea in gold. Diesel smoke curled into the still air, and the faint hum of generators carried across the reef. Crews sat in silence, eating from dented tins, listening to the soft lap of waves against steel.

In that stillness — for the first time since the Vanishing — no one spoke of nations, flags, or borders. They simply existed, held together by salt, sweat, and the stubborn will to endure.

And as night fell over the silent quarter, the world beyond the horizon felt impossibly far away.",3,1761179949.0,EmptyContinents,2,1.0,False
1odpg5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_raijnesart/comments/1odpg5n/building_a_living_art_world_my_journey_blending/,"Building a Living Art World – My Journey Blending Games, Writing, and Interactive Art","Hey everyone, I’m **Polydina Flynt**, a one-person R&D studio creating what I call a **“living art world”** — a space where stories, games, props, and digital experiments blur together into one evolving ecosystem. I’m part writer, part digital artist, part tinkerer, and I’m building a small but growing catalogue of projects that mix old-school imagination with modern, open-source tools.

My first digital art product is a **reimagining of** ***T.A.N.K.S.*** **for the Acorn Archimedes**, a 1996 artillery-style game that I’ve been rebuilding from memory. It’s my love letter to the BBC Micro and early PC eras — all clunky vectors, simple ballistics, and pure creative logic. The goal isn’t just nostalgia; it’s to honor that golden age of tinkering when you could open a program, read the code, and *learn*. That sense of openness still drives me today.

On the physical side, I’ve been building a prop called the **Kinetic Orb** — a segmented tin-and-aluminum sculpture with a clock mechanism, insectoid shadow-play and LED core. It’s part mechanical curiosity, part performance object, and a symbol for how I see art: something that ticks, glows, evolves, and occasionally misbehaves. I treat it as the beating heart of my creative world — an intersection between sculpture, design, and narrative mythology.

Alongside that, I’m developing **The Top 15 App**, a piece of “software art” designed to re-capture the joy of self-expression through lists and nostalgia. Think *43Things* meets *Letterboxd*, but smaller, more personal — a reflection engine rather than a social feed. My other software project, **The Machinist Port**, explores presenting the user with a fake terminal where the only interaction is typing but the output evolves - from simple drawing to looped painting methods, semi-3d extrusion and digital solutions to real-world problems, inventing supported by AI.

Next, I’m diving into two small digital games — **Grounders 2D**, a GameMaker project with physics-based arcade energy (sewer-based football), and **Dungeon of Cats Digital**, a surreal RPG Maker reimagining of my tabletop title. Both are playful worlds designed to feel handmade — like old Amiga or PS1-era games with modern weirdness layered in.

At the same time, I’m working on my first wave of **15 writing projects**: two novellas and two pen-and-paper print-on-demand role-playing games (*n*ovellas: *Pixels vs. Symbols*, and *Destined for Perfection, TTRPGs: Dungeon of Cats* and *Story of the Feldlings*), a nonfiction zine series (*NerdCulture: Coffee & Conversations 1*), a horror-comedy script (*The Mortal Report*), and multiple hybrid works that mix memoir, fiction, and philosophical essays. I’m interested in how stories evolve across mediums — a character from a zine might appear in a short film or a game cutscene later.

Stylistically, I live at the crossroads of **Cronenberg, Jeunet, Carruth and Jim Henson, Don Hertzfeldt and Terry Pratchett, Lars von Trier, Jay Silver, Mark Healey and Eric Chahi** — grotesque but heartfelt, experimental but funny. My influences range from *Labyrinth* to *Upstream Color*, *Discworld* to *Umbilical World*, and *Super Mario World* to *Lemmings*. I want to build something that feels alive — both human and machine-made, both nostalgic and forward-looking.

I’m also deeply committed to **open-source creativity**. Every asset or mechanic I can ethically release for others to use, I will — from RPG Maker templates to sound effects, public zine layouts, and code snippets. But I’m equally focused on developing **original IP** that can grow commercially — scaling sustainable art that can fund itself while staying artist-driven.

My long-term aim is to make **world.exe** — a cohesive, cross-media ecosystem where everything I build connects through tone, mythology, and design. It’s less a company and more a *creative organism* — one that grows by sharing its DNA.

Would love to connect with other devs, writers, and artists doing similar world-building or transmedia work.

So I’ve decided to post my experience on here instead, since I’m very uncertain of what my next move should be. I’ve been feeling a sort of “numbness” for a while, and its not like I completely feel nothing, its that I feel so much but I can’t even express them anymore. I don’t know how to deal with this problem. I’ve felt that as each year passes, small feelings like these began becoming bigger and bigger. Ever since these issues have began appearing more commonly, I’ve found that I’d start waking up feeling various levels of stress and anxiety, some days, more tame. While other days, I’d feel as if the world is about to end if I step out and take risks. During most of my early teen years, I’d get nightmares of me messing up at one thing and having everything come after me. One example of these nightmares started off with a whole community of people living on the sun. I was part of this community. We were trying to achieve something and we were so close, but then I stepped on something as irrelevant as a stick which ended up splitting into two. Then suddenly, all hell broke on me. Everyone and everything looks at me, as the sun’s brightness radiated even brighter in the background. It felt as if a heavy flow of pressure hit me in all directions, everyone screaming at my failure. Through this nightmare it seems obvious that I care about messing up and such, but at the same time I don’t seek validation from others at all, maybe I’m lying to myself which is why I’m trying to look for other perspectives of how I felt on the surface level. 

I felt skinnier when I ate. In addition to my stress and anxiety, I also have a bad relationship with food. I see so many conventionally attractive people around me, so I began starving myself. This began months ago, I’d endlessly starve myself, drown my self in black coffee to try to stop my hunger, and gulped a teaspoon of cinnamon daily to try to de-bloat. I really hated the taste, yet I persisted. Whenever I’d eat too much one day, the next thing you know I feel that I have gained weight already and it lowers my self esteem to an even lower extent, and now it’s just a cycle of me thinking I’ve grown in weight and trying to starve myself to try to lose that weight. Some days, I’d break and end up binge eating, then I’d wake up the next day crying to myself about how I just “HAD” to binge and and “WHY” I couldn’t have just controlled myself. Looking back at my older pictures, somehow, I was skinnier when I used to eat more. Now I’m just an always bloated freak.

Dabble? or absolute not responses. Make it easy for me.

My older brother was with a woman for a couple of years, they split... Reason is because he cheated on her. From what I got to know of her, she seemed lovely. A good down to earth type of person. But to be real, any woman could do better than my brother. My bro kind of sucks, not just in relationships, kind of a shitty distant family member person also. That kind of guy. He's ruined every relationship he's been in.

My brother, he's a year older. We were never close. See each-other at holidays type stuff. Rarely comes around the family energy. Have to chase for answers if he will be attending x-mas. That sort of person.

Anyways, they've been split for a year. I am single, scrolling through tinder, I come across her. I never thought about it, but curiosity got the best of me, just wanted to see what would happen. I swiped yes... Part of that is because I was fond of her as a person, I will admit... And we were a match. She already swiped yes on me.

Age wise, she's a year younger than me. She was 2 years younger than my brother.

Back when she was around, we always got along in a chill way. A natural vibe. Objectively, I honestly think in comparison to my brother based on personalities, me and her would have been a better match. My brothers persona, no one fits into it, stoic serious type, painful to interact with, struggle to crack a smile... Also leaves a destructive wake behind everything he touches. To the point where I feel compelled to warn new women about him that he brings around (but I don't). He sucks.

And if she met me instead of him, probably would have been an honest chance... Legit get along in a free flowing way.

But since she was with my bro. Its a no go from me. I am100% not interested in anything deep here in that way. I have no interest into turning this into a thing. If I bring someone home, I want minimal drama included. Its a closed door to me in regards to that. She was with my brother, its a no from me.

However... We've been messaging and catching up for a couple of days. Actual enjoyable conversation. Nothing flirty, no sexual tension or anything like that. Genuine quality platonic stuff. She asked me to meet up for some drinks or coffee to catch up.

Would I be an idiot to develop a friendship with her like this? Like we were never close to start with, but got along great when we saw each-other. And as friends, we probably would be great ones. Honestly a person that would probably blend well into my group of friends.

Because my marriage is not built on connection, trust, inside jokes, good sex or mutual support. I don’t have memories with this man I’ve been with for almost 10 years, because I never feel any connection deep enough to develop a memory of moments. Our inside jokes are all things I’ve said or done. And there aren’t many of them.

I put in all the effort for a scam. Equality isn’t enough in a hetero marriage for SAHM’s. Equity is. I sobbed today thinking about having to go back to work should we divorce, which I know is our only option at this point. I have so many layers of trauma surrounding my career, on all sides. Him manipulating me out of ambition, horror stories with coworkers, abuse of an employer. I always wanted to be a career woman and I really believe a split would be easier if I was already at least used to and happy with having had a job. But going from being a SAHM for 4 years to having to work for scraps and never see my kids. It’s insane. I have so much resentment. I held up my end of the bargain. I did everything I could and he didn’t even TRY. And now I have to suffer the consequences of him just not caring? I always say, why are women collateral damage for men’s bad behavior? Why am I collateral damage so he can learn a lesson? 

He does just enough for outsiders to think “Wow, what a guy!” and just enough privately, right up to the edge for me to go “this isn’t THAT bad. This isn’t a good reason to divorce.” I’ve been daydreaming about him cheating on me since a few months into marriage so that I’d have a “good” reason to leave him.

I always wanted four kids, to use my degree, to write novels, to live an adventurous life because all I needed was the people I loved to care for (well yes and money. I am pragmatic). Ive always considered myself to be a pragmatic dreamer. I’ve spent my youth getting the life drained out of me. I told him I’d be happy in a trailer, working at coffee shops and bars on the road if it meant we were connecting and laughing and supporting each other. I know that must sound silly. I just feel like my whole relationship has been a lie, a nightmare, and I haven’t been given the opportunity to live authentically because I’m married to someone who is neglectful on all fronts. I’m only 30 but I can’t even think about it because I feel old and ugly and frail and unworthy of love. I feel meaningless.

I can’t say we have fun, because he ignores me. I can’t say we have meaningful conversations, because he dismisses me. I can’t say we have mutual support, because he doesn’t support anything I do and usually makes a face at me when I’m excited to share.

I find out about this FE thing I now have to take if I’m to get my career back. I booked my test end of April and got Oct as the earliest date. Spent 2 months settling the family then earnestly started studying in July.  
  
**The How:**  
\- It was the summer break so all day I’d be home with kids (6 and 8 yr olds) then start studying once they went to bed. We had to play! I’d do **10pm to 4am/5am** then sleep and wake up at 9am when the kids woke up, and repeat. This was **July to Sept,** save for Saturdays when we’d explore as a family. School opened Sept and I had to adjust and start studying during the day while they were in school. I put in too many hours to even count.  
\- 2 days before test, started reading through all those Mark, Genie and text book notes (explained below) and reminding myself how it was all done, right up until the night of the test. I HAD to review it all again! (Perhaps not advisable for all.)  
\- **Day before** \- drove to test center so I could scope out parking. I actually got lost in the building trying to find the center. Was glad it was the day before and knew exactly where to go next day.  
\- Had a cup of coffee in the morning and a slice of leftover pizza before leaving. I carried the **“Reddit recommended snacks”** (dark chocolate, bananas, electrolyte drink) for the break but couldn’t stomach a thing. I sat and stared at the wall for 20 mins in the little waiting room.  
  
**Resources**: Reddit was amazing for helping me find all these resources.  
**1. Lindeburg FE Civil Review** \- took notes like a school child, summarizing each chapter. As others have pointed out, you can skip this book if you’re on a time crunch as it is quite detailed. I needed it to refresh everything (\~1.5months) and learnt a lot too.  
**2. Mark Matson YT videos** \- these were essential in understanding how to apply the raw textbook knowledge. Watched the entire 2022 Review playlist noting a question, attempting it, then noting the solution. Watched on x1.5 speed to get things moving. It’s still very relevant in 2025.  
**3. Genie Prep YT videos** \- also added these in for every topic after I watched Mark. Same process, wrote down everything.  
**4. Islam 800 FE Civil Review** \- total game changer. Did all the questions and started to get a feel for proper test questions. Helped with knowing where everything was in the Reference Manual.  
**5. Islam Practice Exams book** \- 2 x 110 question tests. Went to library, gave myself the allotted time and break and again, more revelations. Did the first one 1 wk before my exam. Left 20. Did the 2nd one a few days out and left 8 questions. On exam day I got to question 109 and left 1. I was so proud!  
**6.Strataway FE Civil Review** \- 150 conceptual questions. Seemingly a new thing. Did those. It was a good, fast, add-on.  
**7. EIT Fasttrack FE Civil Review** \- this was great for getting that initial, much needed ‘pep talk’ and knowing I can do this! Read it at the very beginning. Only did one test in the end.  
**8. No interactive NCEES practice exams** \- many here said the tests were unnecessarily difficult and I didn’t want that confidence knock a few days before my exam. I did half of the old PDF practice test in the early days just to see, but never went back to it. (Probably not advisable also).  
  
Key takeaways:  
1**. Time management is a big deal!** Try, then guess and move on. I spent 2hrs 20mins on part 1 and left 3hrs for section 2 which had been time consuming during my practice runs. I looked back on 1 flagged question and realized I didn’t have a new idea so I scrapped trying to review the flagged ones and just submitted section 1.  
**2. Units are a big deal!** Know how to convert everything and be weary if it’s metric or US units.  
**3. Put in the time** and really make an effort to understand the underlying principles.  
**4. I left feeling uncertain but satisfied I had given it my all.** I made ""intelligent guesses"" on a bunch, never got to review the flagged ones but hey.

  
Lastly, if I could do it, initially clueless about the simple relationship between a foot and inches a few months ago, you surely can do it too! It’s feasible, but just A LOT I found. I want my daughter to grow up knowing there is professional life after kids for a woman. That’s part of my why. **Find your why and let that keep pushing you!**",10,1761179044.0,FE_Exam,0,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with GERD 3 years ago and was put on 40 mg pantoprazole shortly after. I saw some improvement with the meds over a year but still had routine flare ups. I stopped eating after 8:00 PM. Elevated my bed. I cut out coffee, black teas, cooked tomatoes and anything with citrus and found more improvements but still routinely had awful bloating and early fullness when eating. I was also still dealing with routine diarrhea or constipation, sometimes both in the same day. 

I was looking at the assortment of probiotics at my local pharmacy and saw one listed as “IBS support, good for relief from bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation”. The price was right so I tried it. 

Guys. It has changed my life. 

I have been taking them about six months, about two months in I recall telling my partner “I haven’t had a stomach ache in a really long time!”. 

I ran out of the supplements on Saturday and didn’t make it to the pharmacy to get more until yesterday. For days I have been in the worst discomfort. Reflux, heartburn, gas, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, you name it. I couldn’t bare to wear pants with a waistband. Today after taking the probiotic? I ate the same thing as yesterday and I feel….fine. 

The brand I got is CanPrev, it is called Probiotik* IBS Support but the probiotic itself is B. Coagulans. I found it at a Calgary Coop grocery store pharmacy but I believe it’s also available at Well.ca and Amazon. It’s also only $20 CAD for 30 days’ supply. 

I have tried several other multi-strain probiotic brands in the past 3 years as well as digestive enzymes, etc. but this one actually improved my symptoms. I’m not touting this as a cure-all or saying it will work for you. I still have routine visits with my doctor and take a daily PPI. But this has definitely helped me and I hope by sharing it may help someone else.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

I can sometimes get really obsessed and focused on things, and this what how I was with religion. I would try to convert my friends and refused to hear or even consider any ideas that contracted mine. Religion was all I could talk or think about.

When I graduated I decided to move many hours away for college. With the distance. I was able to think clearly. It's taken years for me to slowly untangle myself and figure out who I am without religion.

I know Fremont is very affordable, but I’m going to focus on the strip. My group of friends all go to Vegas 2-4 times a year and have all opted into various credit cards or loyalty programs (I’m partial to MGM). I should start with, none of us are high rollers by any means. Generally $5k-$10k bankrolls each. None of us have paid for a room in years and we receive solid resort credits, but here’s the trick… Be loyal to a property or property group and your money goes so much further! 

If you’re looking for bottle service or want to spend your money in nightclubs, this post isn’t for you as there is no real way to do that and not splurge. But I’m not sure why people act like The Luxor, Flamingo  or any other mid tier resort isn’t an option?

You can easily eat food court food or quick service options if you don’t want to spend tons of money eating. A $20/meal is definitely doable and in a resort town, I wouldn’t consider that expensive. Personally, I’m a foodie so that’s where I tend to splurge when I’m in Vegas and there are some phenomenal dining options on the Strip around $100/person. One of our buddies just eats Subway and Inn-N-Out, very rarely splurges on dinner with the rest of us and that’s totally fine. 

Also, do yourself a favor and do some research on Off-Strip Tiki Bars, go to Peppermill, check out local Taco shops; It’s still a major city with great options away from the immediate tourist areas. If you’re staying at a higher end property, yeah the restaurants and bars in your hotel will be expensive. That’s how it works…

With gambling, you can still find some cheaper tables on the strip especially if you gamble during off hours. I generally stay at Bellagio or MGM Grand and like to wake up early and walk to get a coffee. Casino floors are a ghost town at 7am and the table minimums reflect that. Ive had some of my best  Blackjack runs before breakfast! I don’t think you’ll see $5 craps or anything that cheap, but I Imagine Luxor minimums are pretty cheap on a Thursday morning. 

In conclusion, Vegas is what you make it. If you’re trying to do trendy Instagram inspired stuff you’ll be paying up, but there are sooooo many ways to do Vegas, it’s unfair to just say Vegas is too expensive, you just can’t afford to party like a rapper. ",0,1761178189.0,vegas,34,0.43,False

Also considering the Jura Ena 4 ($1199) and E4 (1399) but the lack of an americano mode and mixed reviews of the black coffee being watery and the increased cost has me reserved.

The Dinamica Plus ($1100) looks similar to my philips that just died. Have heard mixed reviews of the brand.

* They’ve got that blondie-base texture with white chocolate chips and dried cranberries—then topped with cream cheese frosting and a white chocolate drizzle. Big flavor with a light orange zest twist. 
* I followed the tip to let the bars *fully cool* before frosting so the frosting didn’t melt into the base—huge difference in texture and presentation. 
* Pro tip: use orange extract **and** a little orange zest if you have it. That citrus layer lifts the dessert and keeps it from getting too sweet. Others doing this have said theirs came out *better than Starbucks’s version*. 

My tweaks:

* I reduced the white chocolate chips inside the blondie by about ¼ cup because I found the original too “chip-heavy” compared to what I remembered from the cafe.
* I used a 9×13 pan instead of a larger one so the bars were a bit thicker—more satisfying bite.
* I stored them chilled because the frosting stays firm and they slice clean into neat triangles (just like the bar from back in the day).

If you’ve been missing those holiday bar cookies from the coffee shop, this is the one to try. I brought some to work and they disappeared fast.

What’s your favorite topping twist on cranberry bliss bars—extra orange zest, maybe chopped nuts or a little darker chocolate drizzle? 🍊",1,1761178045.0,KetoHomeCooking,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

1odojga,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravelQA/comments/1odojga/review_four_seasons_koh_samui/,Review: Four Seasons Koh Samui,"**A Few Initial Notes:**

***The Cost***

*Let’s talk about the elephant in the room, the cost. The Four Seasons is approximately $1,000 more per night than most other five-star properties on the island, which understandably leaves many people, myself included, scratching their heads. That being said, after seeing two other five-star resorts on Koh Samui, I can say without hesitation that the added cost is justified and absolutely worth it.* 

***The Property Layout*** 

*The resort itself is not walkable. Instead, guests are transported via one of the property’s 55 buggies (golf carts). Initially, I thought this might become irritating (I dont do well with nuisance) but my experience was quite the opposite. The team made the process seamless. I never waited for a buggy, and if I had a spa appointment or dinner reservation to get to, one was already waiting without even asking. The behind-the-scenes coordination was incredibly impressive.*

***Mosquitos***

*We didn’t have issues with the mosquitos and honestly only used the repellent provided by the hotel once throughout the stay…the drama.* 

**The Review** 

**Arrival Experience**

The Four Seasons difference is evident the moment you arrive at USM. Upon entering the arrivals hall, each hotel has a representative holding a sign, but Four Seasons stood out as their vehicle was the only one waiting, saving any additional waiting time (keep in mind we had been flying for almost 20 hours). The drive to the property took just over 30 minutes in a comfortable van equipped with captain’s chairs, cold water, strong air conditioning, and a selection of local snacks.

[Arrival Lobby](https://preview.redd.it/9m4y1got0rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73ec3634b6ff76dba102ed09d7414a06cef3ec3e)

Before I knew it, my driver turned up a steep, unassuming driveway that led to the resort’s welcome pavilion. I was greeted by members of the management team, offered a cold towel and welcome beverage, and took in one of the best views on the island while check-in formalities were handled. Within minutes, I was whisked away in a buggy to my villa, which was ready upon arrival, and I arrived at 8:00 a.m.

[The Living Room  \(the hotel's social hub\)](https://preview.redd.it/6nzajcyv0rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41db16c2229ff3c28d163e61a26264b16d517a53)

**The Room**

I stayed in Villa 703, an Island Ocean Pool Villa. Upon entering, guests are greeted by an infinity pool with two large loungers, a dining table for two, and a well-stocked minibar. The space offered ample privacy and sweeping ocean views. The sliding glass doors opened into the main bedroom, which led to a spacious bathroom featuring dual sinks, separate closets, and a bathtub with beautiful views alongside a large shower. The hard product itself had felt like it had never been touched, as if we were the first people to enjoy the space.

In my opinion, this villa is the perfect setup for a tropical destination, effortlessly blending indoor and outdoor living.

*Note: While the property isn’t walkable, location still matters. My villa was centrally located, just a two-minute buggy ride from all main public areas. A property map below illustrates the layout and accessibility.*

**The Pool and Beach Area**

I spent most of my time alternating between the main pool and the private beach just below it. If you like a vibe, people-watching, soft background music, and attentive service, stick to the pool. Try to grab one of the complimentary day beds, which are first come, first serve. They’re the perfect all-day retreat and a great added value. If it happens to rain, they are covered and the perfect place to ride out the passing showers.

[The Pool](https://preview.redd.it/eqfqfrnx2rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9795b9c77c51c8aa10627e90f8ae5ce058caa1d)

If you prefer peace and quiet, head to the quiet beach located just beyond the family beach near the beach spa, it sits close but feels like a world away. 

[Quiet Beach](https://preview.redd.it/oazkw65c3rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c509e02d0a29431af6bff368eb14d08d7e6e808)

I had lunch by the pool each day. The CoCoRum Restaurant and Bar menu is somewhat limited, but they’re happy to deliver items from any restaurant on the property, just ask your server! Again, food is personal but I highly recommend the seafood ceviche from the Pla Pla menu and the chicken satay and  mango sticky rice from CoCoRum menu!

**The Spa**

The main reason I started my journey through Thailand in Koh Samui was to adjust to the time zone and to indulge in plenty of spa time. I consider myself a spa junkie, and the Four Seasons Koh Samui Spa did not disappoint. The setup reminded me a bit of The Brando’s spa, mostly outdoor with standalone treatment rooms surrounded by lush greenery that really added to the experience.

[The Spa](https://preview.redd.it/lljj7pof3rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=906841a257a249173dd68e02b4eb8896565facfc)

While the facilities are limited (there is no sauna, jacuzzi or communal steam room), the treatments are exceptional. I highly recommend the Four-Hand Massage and the Coconut Hydration Facial (it felt like my face had been doused in La Mer) . The Four-Hand Massage is pricey but worth every penny and dare I say, one of the best massages I’ve ever had. 

[Entrance to Treatment Room](https://preview.redd.it/1qqie1qi3rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bec6b5a71c81317dab095c81cbe10fd0e3fdab9f)

[Treatment Room](https://preview.redd.it/2rmf6bvk3rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=340c5d29b5777f8eec98ec816696f255d6eb2ee7)

***Note:*** *There is construction happening near the property, completely outside the resort’s control. While you can’t hear it anywhere throughout the property (I’m noise sensitive), I did notice some noise in one treatment room. If you’re noise-sensitive, let the spa team know when booking, and they will plan accordingly. They quickly moved my session to a vacant villa, which worked perfectly. I was genuinely impressed by how swiftly and gracefully the team handled the situation.*

**Food and Beverage**

Breakfast is served at KOH Thai Kitchen until 11:00 a.m., offering an extensive buffet with both Eastern and Western options. While I usually prefer in-room dining for breakfast, I was told not to miss this experience, and they were right. The restaurant sits above the treetops with unobstructed ocean views, making it the perfect start to the day.

[View from KOH Kitchen](https://preview.redd.it/8brr5mys3rwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bba08e9a50378f3a7231c11f365f725b0f5128ac)

For lunch, Pla Pla seemed to be the go-to for a sit-down meal. It’s an oceanfront restaurant just to the left of the pool and private beach. That said, most guests seemed perfectly happy enjoying lunch poolside or beachside. The team made it so easy and enjoyable that it was hard to leave your chair! In addition, treats were brought around every hour throughout the day and the ice cream stand on the beach was the perfect place for dessert, the coconut sorbet was my favorite.

https://preview.redd.it/37ilr1n74rwf1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f42e14830aff2c120956681ee9e71214a4d3712

For dinner, the resort hosts themed nights. The Fisherman’s Night on Thursdays, held on the beach, is extremely popular with guests. Although my stay didn’t include a Thursday, I did experience the Thai Buffet, which was the perfect way to end my stay. The selection was extensive, and the live local music added to the ambiance. If you’re on property on a Tuesday, be sure to reserve a table and be prepared to eat. Don’t miss the red curry, I’m still thinking about it! 

**The Service**

This is where the resort truly shines. Not all Four Seasons properties are created equal, but when people think of the Four Seasons experience, they’re thinking of Koh Samui. The service was precise, effortless, and intuitive. The team was always one step ahead. From remembering my coffee order each morning to anticipating my buggy needs without asking to greeting me by name after one introduction, every thoughtful touch elevated my stay.

**Final Thoughts**

To be honest, of the three properties I planned to visit in Thailand, Koh Samui was the one I was least excited about, yet it turned out to be one of the hardest to leave. I’ve experienced some of the world’s finest resorts through my line of work, and I can confidently say that Four Seasons Koh Samui has earned a place among my favorites. It’s a property I cannot wait to return to and one I’ll be thrilled to recommend to my clients.",1,1761177371.0,LuxuryTravelQA,0,1.0,False

1odoit5,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1odoit5/reactive_and_anxious_wheaten_terrier/,Reactive and anxious wheaten terrier,"We have a 5 year old soft coated wheaten terrier and he’s become very anxious and reactive over the last couple of years. 

I used to walk him every single day, he was fine when he was a puppy/younger was always the friendly dog who wanted to say hi to people and other dogs.

Now walking him is a nightmare, he’ll be ok for the start then something will spook him, his tail goes between his legs and he pulls so hard with both his front legs and tries to get away, then that’s it for the remainder of the walk, he does not calm down, treats don’t work he’s in such a state he doesn’t listen to anything. Things that spook him: bikes, scooters, men with hoodies, anyone in a hat, anyone that says hello to me as they pass, courier and posties, anything new that’s not normally there like a community sign or something, and sometimes nothing at all! We used to walk the kids to school every morning, so same route, then gradually he started getting spooked nearing the same road/area every single time all of a sudden, nothing else happened just at a certain part of the walk, I thought maybe it was traffic from a busier road but we did that same walk in the holidays and it was totally quiet with no cars and he still got spooked/wound up, tail between legs and lunges to try and get away, then again that’s him for the rest of the walk, does not calm down, stays like that until we get home.  

At home he’s on high alert a lot of the time, always looking out the window, we have a shared driveway with 2 neighbours so every car that comes up and down the drive he goes nuts, barks, paces around, rushes the door, again will not listen to anything/can’t be calmed down, then this will continue for 15-20 mins - if he just alerted and then calmed down it wouldn’t be so bad but he stays so wound up for so long. Today a courier knocked on the door, he went flying over the coffee table and couch to get to the door quicker, sent coffee cups flying, coffee everywhere, cups smashed, and there’s a big claw scratch on the table from him launching himself from it with such force. 

He loves going in the car, used to come with me all the time to pick the kids up from school etc, now if he’s in the car and sees another dog walk by he’ll get so aggressive, lunges at the window and barks like mad in a really aggressive way - to the point that I don’t take him anywhere anymore.

It’s so draining and I’m starting to hate him. We’ve had dogs before but none never like this so I just don’t know what to do to fix it.

Nothing happened to cause this shift in behaviour, he was fine up until around
2 or 3 and it’s just gradually gotten worse.

I woke up yesterday and something was wrong.

Not like “I had a bad dream” wrong, or “I’m sick” wrong. I mean fundamentally wrong — like I’d opened my eyes and found myself inside someone else’s body.

Everything looked familiar, but it felt like I was seeing it for the first time. My room was the same. The same posters, the same dirty clothes on the floor, the same half-finished cup of coffee from the night before. But when I sat up, I had this sudden rush of panic — like I was waking up inside a photograph of my life, not the real thing.

You know how when you look at an old picture, you can tell it’s you, but it’s not you anymore? That’s what it felt like.

I tried to shake it off. I told myself I was just disoriented. Maybe I’d had a weird dream, or maybe I was still in one. But then I checked my phone.

The date said October 21st, 2025.

I went to bed on October 19th.

There was no 20th for me. I didn’t dream, I didn’t move, I didn’t exist. But apparently, I did. Because when I got to work, everyone said they’d seen me yesterday.

“You were quiet,” one of my coworkers said. “Didn’t seem like yourself, honestly.”

That phrase — didn’t seem like yourself — has been replaying in my head all day.

When I asked what I’d done, she shrugged. “Nothing weird,” she said. “You just kept asking people what year it was. Thought you were joking.”

The worst part? I checked my messages from that day. There are texts from me — to my mom, to my boss, even to a friend I haven’t spoken to in months. But they don’t sound like me. The phrasing, the punctuation — it’s off. I always type with proper punctuation, but these messages were all lowercase, full of ellipses, and some of them didn’t even make sense.

Here’s one I apparently sent to my mom:

“it feels better now. i see what you meant.”



She replied:

 “Honey, that’s good. I told you it just takes time.”



When I called her, she acted strange — like she was trying too hard to sound normal. I told her I didn’t remember anything about the 20th. She went silent for a long time and then said, “You don’t remember the hospital?”

Hospital.

That’s when I found the scar — a small, healing wound at the back of my head.

I don’t remember hitting it. I don’t remember anything.

Later that night, I found a note on my kitchen counter. Folded paper. My handwriting.

It said:

 “Don’t trust your reflection. It learns faster than you do.”



I laughed when I read it — nervously, the way you laugh at something when you’re trying not to scream. But now I’m not so sure it’s a joke.

Because this morning, I caught my reflection watching me.

I mean that literally. I was brushing my teeth, half-asleep, and I noticed the reflection was just slightly behind my movements — a tiny lag. Like a bad video call. I thought maybe it was just me being paranoid, until it smiled before I did.

I dropped the toothbrush and stumbled back. My heart was hammering.

When I looked again, it was normal. Perfectly synced.

I spent the rest of the day trying to convince myself I was imagining things. I even tried calling my doctor, but the number just rang and rang — no voicemail, nothing.

Then, tonight, I got another text. Unknown number.

 “You’re stabilizing. Don’t look too closely.”



I swear I hadn’t given my number to anyone. The message vanished after a few seconds, before I could screenshot it.

Now the lights in my apartment are flickering. Only the kitchen light — the others are fine. When it flickers, I swear I can see movement in the dark spaces between flashes.

I tried cutting the power completely, but the kitchen light stayed on.

Dim. Humming. Almost alive.

I went to unplug it from the socket, but there was no plug. Just the cord trailing into the wall and vanishing.

And the reflection in the dark window above the sink — it didn’t move.

It just stood there, staring.

I whispered, “What are you?”

And it whispered back, in perfect sync with my voice:

> “You weren’t supposed to wake up.”




---

I’m posting this here because I don’t know what else to do. My phone keeps freezing when I try to record video. I can hear faint whispers when I sleep, coming from somewhere behind my bedroom wall.

Sometimes they sound like my voice.

I think maybe I died on the 20th. Or maybe I was replaced.

If anyone out there wakes up one day and something feels off — if your pets avoid you, or your reflection seems to move differently — please, don’t ignore it.

Because whatever happened to me, I don’t think it’s done yet.

There’s something scratching inside the walls.

I want to share my story because I know how important it is to hear that recovery is possible, even if only partially, gradually, over time. I have suffered from PSSD for a very long time, severely for about seven years, but probably in a milder form for several years before that, before I even knew the condition existed.

Seven years ago, Venlafaxine drastically worsened my condition. I completely lost sensation in my genital area, the ability to orgasm, and sexual desire. At the same time, my emotions disappeared, my memory worsened, anhedonia set in, sweating stopped, and I developed many other neurological symptoms. I also noticed that alcohol or any other substances no longer affected me in any way.

Over the years, I tried many medications and supplements, but nothing helped. On the contrary, I developed new symptoms, such as a blank mind, chronic fatigue, and PEM symptoms. Eventually, I could no longer bear the constant struggle and despair, as my condition only worsened with the continuous thought that I had to find a solution.

On my brother’s recommendation, I eventually sought therapy and found a therapist who truly believed me and understood that it was PSSD. Therapy, of course, did not cure the illness itself, but it helped calm my thoughts enough that my mind stayed somewhat at peace. I learned to approach my situation more realistically and began trying to live life more day by day, without the constant compulsion to find a solution or worry whether I still had a future.

I was still constantly exhausted and had to rely on coffee and energy drinks to get through workdays. Sleep did not refresh me.

But then, a few years ago, I began to notice some small changes. Sensation in my genital area slowly started to return on its own, first a little, then more. Gradually, sensation in the rest of my body also returned. I can now say that sensation is fully normal throughout my body, and my ability to orgasm has returned to normal. Libido, however, remains fairly low, even though physical function has recovered.

This year, I tried immunoadsorption therapy, which brought significant relief from constant fatigue and PEM symptoms. Sweating has also returned to normal. The symptoms have not returned, and I am now able to get through workdays without caffeine.

Note: I will not answer questions about how or why I received immunoadsorption therapy.

I still do not feel the effects of alcohol or caffeine, and I continue to have severe anhedonia. Yet over the years, the emotional numbness has somewhat eased. Nowadays, I can feel strong reactions in my body to certain things that matter to me: my heart beats faster, my body warms up, and my muscles tense, even if I do not fully feel the emotions consciously.

Recovery has been slow and uneven, but it has been real. I want to tell others struggling with PSSD: do not lose hope that things can change.

My recovery journey is still ongoing.",5,1761176956.0,PSSD,1,1.0,False

1odobsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CholinergicUrticaria/comments/1odobsk/my_experience/,My experience,"Hey all… long time reader first time poster.
Just wanted to share my experience in case anyone feels the same. Really though just want to vent about this absolutely brutal condition.

I’ve had one dose of Xolair so far and nothing yet has changed. Hoping in the coming months I begin to see significant changes because I am almost unable to do day-to-day activities. 

Life in every single aspect has been impacted. It’s increasingly difficult to take my dog on a walk, if I do sometimes I wear a t-shirt and shorts in cold, rainy fall weather just so I don’t even get remotely warm. It’s difficult to be intimate with my wife, I dread anytime I need to ask a question or speak to a higher up at work, and sometimes just simply sitting on the couch watching TV I will get triggered.

The slightest “heat” or nervousness causes major prickly and burning sensation. At first hives would not appear but now smaller bumps are arising. 

I’ve tried many antihistamines, tried stopping certain foods and drinks like coffee, but not much has helped. 

One thing that has helped me for a short-term basis, and it’s controversial is marijuana. I’ve previously been an occasional weed smoker so it wasn’t a huge deal for me to spark one up. I’ve realized for a few hours after my symptoms go away and I am able to actually operate. Unfortunately it’s led to me becoming reliant on it when performing certain tasks, like mowing the lawn, etc. But it helps me get certain things done. It’s not for everybody and it’s certainly not a cure but just mentioning because it has helped me. 

Another odd thing to note but I was in Hawaii for vacation over summer and I was really worried about how my body would react. To my surprise I was completely okay. Not a single episode or trigger whatsoever. So I guess I need to move there!
I’m assuming that’s because of the overall warm weather and no fluctuation of temperature leading my body to acclimate. 

 Anyways, that’s my long rant of just spilling my feelings on this thread with people who I’m sure could relate. 

Thx for listening and hope everyone is able to escape this hell

Cheers

What is the West Coast Express and why riders love it

The West Coast Express is Metro Vancouver’s commuter train that helps riders cruise into downtown Vancouver without battling traffic or juggling bus transfers. 

Grab a comfy seat, sip your coffee and enjoy the scenic ride while the train does all the work.

It runs weekdays during rush hours: 

westbound into Vancouver in the morning and eastbound in the evening. It connects communities like Mission, Maple Ridge, and Port Coquitlam to Waterfront Station in the heart of downtown.

Inside, it’s a quieter, more relaxed ride. You’ll find spacious seats, quiet cars and room for bikes. It’s not a high-speed bullet train, but it’s smooth, scenic, and surprisingly chill, especially compared to Highway 1 at rush hour.

Think of it as Vancouver’s calm, scenic and slightly fancy way to commute.

1odo7lk,https://i.redd.it/vidp1wuu1rwf1.jpeg,Passed the CAPM over the weekend! Here’s my quick study breakdown and experience.,"
Background:
I don’t have any direct project management experience, just an educational foundation. Earlier this year, I completed four project management courses as part of my B.A. in Business Admin with a concentration in Project Mgt. That gave me a good base before I started studying.

Study timeline:
I started studying on October 2nd and took the exam on October 18th, so a little over two weeks total. Definitely a tight window, but it worked out.

Study materials I used:
-Pocket Prep (daily quizzes and exams)
-Peter Landini Practice Exam (Kindle)
-Andrew Ramdayal CAPM Practice Video on YouTube
-Alvin the PM and Ricardo Vargas PMBOK 7th Edition videos on YouTube
-5-Minute CAPM Formula video

Study strategy:
I listened to all the long YouTube videos at least twice while driving, at the gym, or doing things around the house. I also copied the entire PMBOK 7th Edition eBook (which I accessed for free through my public library) into Notebook LM and created my own audio overviews, quizzes, flashcards and video clip summaries to review with.

On Pocket Prep, I averaged around 70 to 80%, and about 70 to 75% on Peter Landini’s short quizzes. When I got questions wrong, I would Google or ask ChatGPT to understand the reasoning and then wrote the terms or explanations down by hand for later review. The night before the exam, I took one 50-question mock from each domain and scored about the same.

Exam day:
That morning, I had a light breakfast and a coffee with an extra shot of espresso (didn’t sleep well). I reviewed my written notes, rewatched the 5-Minute Formula video, and listened to Alvin the PM’s PMBOK 7th Edition video on my 30-minute drive to the test center.

I took the exam in person at 8 AM, the earliest slot available. Definitely arrive early to avoid waiting on other test takers to be processed. Take the 10-minute break in between the sections to stretch, drink some water, and reset your focus. Be mindful of your time (aim for 1 minute per question) because I started to get fatigued about halfway through and had to skim through the last ten questions, almost guessing a few. The strikethrough feature helped a lot to eliminate wrong answers and choose between the remaining two when I wasn’t sure.

Tips:
Know your basic formulas (EV, PV, AC, SPI) and draw the SPACE diagram on your scratch paper at the start. Don’t stress about the math too much (I’m not great at math so I get it). Just understand what each formula means and when to divide or subtract.

If you’re scoring in the 70 to 80% range on your practice exams, you’re in a good spot. Don’t get discouraged by seeing others posting 80-90%. You can still pass.

Make sure you understand the differences between Agile, Predictive, Adaptive, and Scrum. And most importantly, focus on developing the PM mindset: never delay, never fire, always analyze before acting, and know how business analysis differs from product management.

Honestly, I didn’t think I passed while taking it, but seeing the “Congratulations” screen was such a relief. The test center even printed my results right after I walked out of the exam.

I wouldn’t necessarily recommend cramming in less than a month, but if you already have some background knowledge, it’s definitely doable.

Good luck to anyone currently studying. You’ve got this! 💪

After Covid, the specialty coffee scene exploded with the rapid advancement in basically every single aspect, especially in the capital, Riyadh, and specialty cafes are even more popular than non specialty ones. 

The neighborhood I used to live in had at least 6 different options within walking distance, and it’s considered a modest area compared to the more developed areas in the northern part of the city, I can’t begin to explain how popular cafes are there, the sheer amount of cafes that open is insane. 


Now here’s where I talk about my experience coming to India for the first time, specifically Hyderabad. First thing I obviously noticed is the how far away the nearest cafes are to my area, the idea of driving for more than 30 minutes to simply drink coffee in the morning makes me go crazy lmao. But I can clearly see how it’s only getting better and more popular.

I’ve been in the hotel biz for about a decade now. Back in 2015, I started at a hotel that shared a parking lot with its “sister” property. In the same month I was hired, another woman—let’s call her Carla (45F)—was hired at the sister hotel. Over the years, we both climbed the ladder to front office supervisors and occasionally crossed paths, mostly friendly hellos and the usual “how’s your shift?” chats.

Fast forward a few years: I’m assistant manager at my hotel, and Carla had stepped down back to a desk associate role at her place. Our two hotels started working more closely together under the same GM—think joint holiday parties, staff mingling, the works. I met Carla’s husband Tim (45M), their two sons, her mom, her sister... basically the whole crew.

Eventually, Carla moved over to work at my hotel—right under my supervision—and even baked me Christmas cookies (which, FYI, instantly makes you a favorite). She met my kid, we became close-ish, and I trained her to be a front office supervisor/assistant manager. Tim often came by during Carla’s shifts. He’s a total people person—super friendly, the kind of guy who can chat about anything from the weather to why the coffee machine always breaks.

In early 2023, I got promoted to GM at another hotel in the company, while Carla stayed put. A couple months later, Tim asked if there were any front desk openings. Knowing he was great and seeing how sweet Carla was, I hired him—because hey, if the husband’s a good guy, that’s a win, right?

So here we are, present day. I’m AGM and Tim still works front desk. A few months ago, Tim confided that he and Carla have been having some trouble—separate bedrooms, her being distant, the classic “we’re having issues” stuff. Then this past weekend, I spot Tim out to dinner with Sally (28F), a coworker from Food & Beverage, and her family. When they noticed me waving, Tim looked like he’d seen a ghost and practically vanished.

Next thing I know, Tim texts me: “I bet that looked weird, huh?” He says he was just showing Sally’s family a good restaurant and asks me to keep it hush-hush. The very next day at work, Tim comes into my office and says Sally has been there for him when Carla hasn’t, and he’s been helping her out with some things. Then he asks if I think he’s giving off any “more than friends” vibes with Sally. I said no, but he asked again to keep this under wraps—especially from the GM.

So here I am, feeling like I’m in a soap opera but without the luxury of commercial breaks. It sounds sketchy, and honestly, I feel for Carla because nobody deserves to be blindsided. But is it my place to say anything? Tim and Sally work 4-5 shifts together every week. Do I tell the GM, or just keep my head down and hope this all blows over? I feel so awkward around both of them now.

I of course can’t take the vitamin anymore because it’s too late all is lost I might as well throw the vitamins in the trash and never touch them again. Everyone even you guys didn’t remind me.

I’ll wait or do nothing about the vitamins until I create someone to blame that I’m vitamin deficient. Lmk if it’s you.

1odnsi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1odnsi0/review_four_seasons_resort_koh_samui/,Review: Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui,"First hotel review for Reddit, thank you in advance for taking the time to read it! 

**A Few Initial Notes:**

***The Cost***

*Let’s talk about the elephant in the room, the cost. The Four Seasons is approximately $1,000 more per night than most other five-star properties on the island, which understandably leaves many people, myself included, scratching their heads. That being said, after seeing two other five-star resorts on Koh Samui, I can say without hesitation that the added cost is justified and absolutely worth it.* 

***The Property Layout*** 

*The resort itself is not walkable. Instead, guests are transported via one of the property’s 55 buggies (golf carts). Initially, I thought this might become irritating (I dont do well with nuisance) but my experience was quite the opposite. The team made the process seamless. I never waited for a buggy, and if I had a spa appointment or dinner reservation to get to, one was already waiting without even asking. The behind-the-scenes coordination was incredibly impressive.*

***Mosquitos***

*We didn’t have issues with the mosquitos and honestly only used the repellent provided by the hotel once throughout the stay…the drama.* 

**The Review** 

**Arrival Experience**

The Four Seasons difference is evident the moment you arrive at USM. Upon entering the arrivals hall, each hotel has a representative holding a sign, but Four Seasons stood out as their vehicle was the only one waiting, saving any additional waiting time (keep in mind we had been flying for almost 20 hours). The drive to the property took just over 30 minutes in a comfortable van equipped with captain’s chairs, cold water, strong air conditioning, and a selection of local snacks.

[Arrival lobby](https://preview.redd.it/75k4ywj5sqwf1.jpg?width=1071&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea38ac45640e632d247219aa238699dd7d0c7484)

Before I knew it, my driver turned up a steep, unassuming driveway that led to the resort’s welcome pavilion. I was greeted by members of the management team, offered a cold towel and welcome beverage, and took in one of the best views on the island while check-in formalities were handled. Within minutes, I was whisked away in a buggy to my villa, which was ready upon arrival, and I arrived at 8:00 a.m.

[The Living Room \(the hotel's social hub\)](https://preview.redd.it/eh0gc65gyqwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dee695718747159be94209727f73bf7ed19374f)

**The Room**

I stayed in Villa 703, an Island Ocean Pool Villa. Upon entering, guests are greeted by an infinity pool with two large loungers, a dining table for two, and a well-stocked minibar. The space offered ample privacy and sweeping ocean views. The sliding glass doors opened into the main bedroom, which led to a spacious bathroom featuring dual sinks, separate closets, and a bathtub with beautiful views alongside a large shower. The hard product itself had felt like it had never been touched, as if we were the first people to enjoy the space.

In my opinion, this villa is the perfect setup for a tropical destination, effortlessly blending indoor and outdoor living.

*Note: While the property isn’t walkable, location still matters. My villa was centrally located, just a two-minute buggy ride from all main public areas. A property map below illustrates the layout and accessibility.*

**The Pool and Beach Area**

I spent most of my time alternating between the main pool and the private beach just below it. If you like a vibe, people-watching, soft background music, and attentive service, stick to the pool. Try to grab one of the complimentary day beds, which are first come, first serve. They’re the perfect all-day retreat and a great added value. If it happens to rain, they are covered and the perfect place to ride out the passing showers.

[The Pool](https://preview.redd.it/brik5ngpsqwf1.jpg?width=1071&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5179f1ff41adc7bdd96770b6284c526789a82057)

If you prefer peace and quiet, head to the quiet beach located just beyond the family beach near the beach spa, it sits close but feels like a world away. 

[Quiet Beach](https://preview.redd.it/g2oryx7fsqwf1.jpg?width=1071&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7722d724fda7687e3fca6a6b3514cb08161b5b92)

I had lunch by the pool each day. The CoCoRum Restaurant and Bar menu is somewhat limited, but they’re happy to deliver items from any restaurant on the property, just ask your server! Again, food is personal but I highly recommend the seafood ceviche from the Pla Pla menu and the chicken satay and  mango sticky rice from CoCoRum menu!

**The Spa**

The main reason I started my journey through Thailand in Koh Samui was to adjust to the time zone and to indulge in plenty of spa time. I consider myself a spa junkie, and the Four Seasons Koh Samui Spa did not disappoint. The setup reminded me a bit of The Brando’s spa, mostly outdoor with standalone treatment rooms surrounded by lush greenery that really added to the experience.

[The Spa](https://preview.redd.it/ivf74qaeuqwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be4d553f44c79ae0bb5f0787eac0cd526651f6e0)

While the facilities are limited (there is no sauna, jacuzzi or communal steam room), the treatments are exceptional. I highly recommend the Four-Hand Massage and the Coconut Hydration Facial (it felt like my face had been doused in La Mer) . The Four-Hand Massage is pricey but worth every penny and dare I say, one of the best massages I’ve ever had. 

[Entrance to Treatment Room](https://preview.redd.it/bfvvp6bkuqwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c30643323b419eb59196138947272fe364d7fbe)

[Treatment Room](https://preview.redd.it/e21u2fyguqwf1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89e15af59dd1098866673f6c7420fc82cec3c01c)

***Note:*** *There is construction happening near the property, completely outside the resort’s control. While you can’t hear it anywhere throughout the property (I’m noise sensitive), I did notice some noise in one treatment room. If you’re noise-sensitive, let the spa team know when booking, and they will plan accordingly. They quickly moved my session to a vacant villa, which worked perfectly. I was genuinely impressed by how swiftly and gracefully the team handled the situation.*

**Food and Beverage**

Breakfast is served at KOH Thai Kitchen until 11:00 a.m., offering an extensive buffet with both Eastern and Western options. While I usually prefer in-room dining for breakfast, I was told not to miss this experience, and they were right. The restaurant sits above the treetops with unobstructed ocean views, making it the perfect start to the day.

[Coconut French Toast](https://preview.redd.it/wzgh2dosuqwf1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7050f9f77840f8ed596de8bd6836bd570f103013)

For lunch, Pla Pla seemed to be the go-to for a sit-down meal. It’s an oceanfront restaurant just to the left of the pool and private beach. That said, most guests seemed perfectly happy enjoying lunch poolside or beachside. The team made it so easy and enjoyable that it was hard to leave your chair! In addition, treats were brought around every hour throughout the day and the ice cream stand on the beach was the perfect place for dessert, the coconut sorbet was my favorite. 

https://preview.redd.it/rtssdwoovqwf1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5e7bce4b479fa4972648fb154a70af16df8d2d5

For dinner, the resort hosts themed nights. The Fisherman’s Night on Thursdays, held on the beach, is extremely popular with guests. Although my stay didn’t include a Thursday, I did experience the Thai Buffet, which was the perfect way to end my stay. The selection was extensive, and the live local music added to the ambiance. If you’re on property on a Tuesday, be sure to reserve a table and be prepared to eat. Don’t miss the red curry, I’m still thinking about it! 

**The Service**

This is where the resort truly shines. Not all Four Seasons properties are created equal, but when people think of the Four Seasons experience, they’re thinking of Koh Samui. The service was precise, effortless, and intuitive. The team was always one step ahead. From remembering my coffee order each morning to anticipating my buggy needs without asking to greeting me by name after one introduction, every thoughtful touch elevated my stay.

**Final Thoughts**

To be honest, of the three properties I planned to visit in Thailand, Koh Samui was the one I was least excited about, yet it turned out to be one of the hardest to leave. I’ve experienced some of the world’s finest resorts through my line of work, and I can confidently say that Four Seasons Koh Samui has earned a place among my favorites. It’s a property I cannot wait to return to and one I’ll be thrilled to recommend to my clients.",21,1761175343.0,chubbytravel,4,0.97,False

# 

**TL;DR:** The universe doesn't exist independently of your participation. When you change how you participate, the universe changes. I proved this when I had a fracture and experienced zero pain—same event, different participation, completely different reality. Stop approaching life with postmortem consciousness (blaming, questioning why) and start approaching with initiation consciousness (what is this aligning me for?). Two obstacles: doubting this is real, and postponing implementation.



Listen. I need to tell you something that will completely change how you see reality.

The Yoga Sutras (4.15) say it multiple ways, but here's the core: ""The same object is seen in different ways by different minds."" This isn't just about perception being subjective. This is about the universe *not having independent existence.*

The universe happens *as you participate in it.* When your participation changes—when the mood of your participation changes, when the attitude changes—the universe itself changes.

# Two Sacred Secrets

Please understand, there are two truths here:

**First:** When your participation changes, the universe changes. Not metaphorically. Actually.

**Second:** Because different minds experience the universe differently, it doesn't have definite existence. Not having definite existence but still creating impact on you—this is why it's called Maya.

It's the hands with which you touch. The eyes with which you see. The nose with which you smell. The tongue with which you taste. These play the major role in the universe happening around you.

# What a Master Actually Does

The only job a Master does is changing your participation. Changing your gestalt. This is what I call initiation.

Initiation happens through:

* The right words
* Energy transmission
* Inserting new lifestyle patterns
* Sometimes just a look—being seen

In Sanskrit: *drishti* (by your seeing, you create). Not poetry. Actual mechanism.

# The Zen Proof

You know that Zen koan—if a tree falls in a forest with nobody there, does it make a sound?

Nobody knows. Sound happens only when vibrations are *perceived* by somebody. Till it's perceived, you can't call it a sound.

Right now there's a fan running, AC humming, ambient noise—unless you remember it, unless you hear it, you can't call it a sound. When it's happening without your attention, it's not a sound. It's just vibration.

A leaf falling and becoming mud, or vibrations from a falling tree merging with air—same thing. No difference. Unless you hear it or see it, your hearing names it ""sound,"" your seeing creates the separation.

**Happenings are just happenings.** The way you look, the way you perceive—that's responsible for the universe you experience.

# Real Talk: My Fracture Story

I can give you direct proof from my life.

After I got a fracture, I was telling my team exactly what was happening inside me. I said: the reason there's no suffering is because I'm not looking back. I'm not thinking ""Why did I get into that?"" or ""Why didn't I listen to my coach?""

My coach was insistent—Swami, get a helmet and all the protection, then get on the horse. Why take risk?

I didn't look back. No regret. No guilt.

I could have sat there asking all those questions. I tell you, when things have happened, it's Time Shaft—*kalaba* (that which has become eternal time). If you approach kalaba with postmortem questioning, you only get suffering.

When you cut a dead body, you only get bad odor. You only feel filth.

**This is what most people do with life events. They perform autopsies on decisions already made.**

Time Shaft has happened. It's kalaba now. Eternal. The only way to approach it—life, kalaba, Time Shaft, all the same—is with acceptance or gratitude. Not postmortem mood.

All the questions I *could have* created: Why did I get on the horse? Why didn't I listen? Why did this brahmachari play loud music?

I didn't create those questions. I just knew it was kalaba. Life aligning me.

# What I Knew Immediately

I am very clear. Please understand, I am very, very clear. The moment the fracture happened, I was clear: life is aligning this hand. Maybe for some extraordinary powers and experiences.

Maybe the hand will start materializing objects. Maybe it'll give powerful direct Enlightenment initiation to people. Maybe it needs alignment for something specific.

I didn't invite the accident. Same way, I didn't go to life with postmortem mood. I went with initiation mood.

The Gita says it—approach the Master with deep seeking mood and serving mood.

I tell you: approach life the same way.

I'll prove in a few days—not only did I have no pain (already proved), but this happened for auspicious reasons. Maybe certain alignment is happening inside.

Our foolish mind asks: Can't the universe do this without a fracture? Can't it be milder?

**The only difference between you and me is I don't ask those questions. That's all. That's why he's doing it on me. That's why he's free to do on me. Because you'll ask all these questions, he's not doing it with you. That's all. Nothing else.**

# Same Event, Different Universe

When your participation changes, the whole happening becomes different.

The same fracture that could have caused:

* Tremendous physical suffering
* Tremendous mental suffering
* Depression and distrust

Many people experience this. A small ant bite, mosquito bite, small blade cut—enough. They'll start blaming all 33 crore gods. Why didn't Ganesha protect me? Why didn't Subramanya? What happened to Kali? I pray every day. What happened to Hanuman?

The distress they create—you won't believe. They'll cry their whole life over a small cut.

The same incident—because of my participation—became:

* No physical pain
* No psychological suffering
* Tremendous trust in the universe

The universe is mending the system. Preparing it. Maybe for great work.

My team who saw it—they were suffering. I said, ""What are you talking about? This small fracture? Because you're seeing from outside, you think it's big suffering. If you'd seen my Enlightenment experience and the year I was settling into the body—that was like 10,000 fractures. I had no pain, but equivalent intensity. Complete real altering.""

Because you didn't see that, you don't know the whole picture. Now you see this fracture, you think it's pain.

Enlightenment itself is at least 10,000 fractures. Whole body gets aligned. Now it's just the hand. The whole body was getting aligned back then.

# The Results

Allowing nature to align itself increased:

* More trust
* More connection with universe
* Physical, mental, spiritual energies
* Auspiciousness

My participation with this incident only increased everything.

I'll prove in the next few days—the sudden surge of extraordinary powers this hand is radiating. Because I'm seeing tremendous healing power flowing through to heal the fracture. Like heat coming out. Maybe the hand is getting prepared to give powerful initiations, transmit Enlightenment, or materialize objects. Maybe the body is getting ready for extraordinary happenings.

That's all.

**The way you participate in the universe changes the universe you experience.**

# Life Is Like a Breeze

If you sit with it, it flows through you and brings freshness. If you fight it, run against it, even the small dust it carries can blind you and make you curse the breeze, sun, moon, hills.

The secret: **you have freedom to participate as you want.**

Don't participate in the way that creates suffering, pain, unfulfillment. If you're having these, you're not participating right. You need initiation.

This is the initiation: Universe is your part. It's waiting to celebrate through you. Waiting to experience ultimate through you. Waiting to enjoy extraordinary through you.

Digest this. Receive it. Change your participation immediately.

# Two Obstacles

# 1. Distrust

""Who knows if it's true?""

But look at my life, my experience—the question disappears. If I really had pain and suffering, I don't need to cover it up. Who am I promoting? I have no obligation. I'd just say: there's pain, there's suffering, what can be done, nothing works.

I don't need to promote someone's concepts. Who knows who Patanjali is? Why should I promote what he spoke? I'm not interested. I only see what's true in my experience. That's why I'm sharing this.

Real talk: **Life is waiting to celebrate through you. Life isn't against you. It's not your enemy. It's waiting to gush through you, breeze through you, surge through you, overflow through you.**

# 2. Postponement

""What's the urgency? Yeah, it's true. I'll work on it later.""

Let me tell you a story from my life.

After Polytechnic, I felt strongly I should leave home and start my *parivrajaka* (spiritual wandering) to achieve the ultimate. But one side of my mind: what's there? Why the urgency? There's a festival at Arunachala Temple coming up. Let me see that first. Then go.

After all, it's not worldly stuff—it's divine. Not uncle's funeral or brother's marriage. It's divine. Why not see all this, then leave slowly?

That night I saw Ramakrishna and Sarada appear. I fell at their feet. Ramakrishna said, ""Sarada is the expert in initiation."" Sarada put her hand on my head and initiated me.

I looked at Ramakrishna: ""At least tell me something. Give me some *upadesh* (instruction).""

He said: **""Unless you feel like a man whose hair is on fire—that intensity—will a man with his head on fire think 'oh, let me have coffee first, let me attend my brother's marriage and uncle's funeral'?""**

Those people aren't going to have honeymoon or liberate. The honeymoon is done by whoever got married. Liberation is done by me. But they're busy with their stuff.

A man whose head is burning won't think: let me have coffee, then I'll put out the fire.

All I had was: let me attend this festival, then leave Arunachala.

But Ramakrishna said: unless you feel your head is on fire with that intensity, you won't break. You'll keep postponing.

Next morning I was out. No more.

# The Silent Destroyer

Here's the problem: many of you will catch what I'm saying. Universe is celebrating through you. Not your enemy. But to *live* it, to make it part of your thinking—you'll think ""I'll start seriously practicing this next week. Next month. Today I have too much work. Tomorrow I'll start.""

**This postponing is a serious, dangerous silent destroyer.**

Medical terms call blood pressure a silent killer. You don't even know you have it. Suddenly you're dead.

Same with postponing—silent destroyer of everything you're seeking. The inspiration you took up spiritual life with, the understanding you're trying to transform with—destroyed by one postponement. ""Later on. What's there?""

Avoid these two: doubt and postponement.

# Insert This Now

You can insert these truths only now. If you miss the next 10 minutes to take this in, to make it part of your thinking—see, your thinking has corrupted parts. Those parts cause suffering and confusion.

Pour this initiation as medicine in those corrupted parts. Realign your thinking.

Take these moments. I'll vibrate this truth so your inner being is in entanglement—new word: *ensatsang* (energetic alignment in truth)—and your inner space vibrates in the same frequency as mine. So this initiation, this truth, is transmitted into you.

Receive this and fill your thinking with one great truth: **Life in all forms—including life happening in your worst enemy—even that life is only fulfilling you. Only sharpening some dimension you need for life.**



The participatory universe is available right here, right now. To transform this understanding into living experience, the Paramashiva Sena Summit (October 1 - November 1, 2025) offers direct transmission of these consciousness technologies through living Siddha tradition.

What part of your life are you approaching with ""postmortem consciousness"" instead of ""initiation consciousness""?

**Om Nithyananda Paramashivoham!**

I’ve seen a few posts here about how hard it is to photograph candles properly, so I thought I’d share something that might help.

I’ve been a **product photographer for 13 years**, and over the last few months I’ve done several **candle photography sessions,** everything from cozy soy candles with handmade labels to sleek, high-end minimal designs. Getting that soft glow, clean wax texture, and true color is tricky: it takes the right balance of lighting and styling to make the photo feel as warm as your candle smells.

**1️⃣ Use natural light whenever you can.** Set up near a big window during the day when the light is bright but not harsh — mornings or late afternoons are ideal. If the sun’s too strong, hang a white curtain or tape up a piece of parchment paper to soften it. You’ll get that beautiful, even lighting that makes your candle’s colors and textures look true-to-life. Skip yellow room lights — they make wax tones and labels look off.

**2️⃣ Keep your setup clean and simple.** A neutral background (white, beige, or soft wood tones) makes your candle stand out. Add one or two props that match your scent or vibe — like dried herbs, fabric, or a cozy coffee mug — but avoid clutter. You want the photo to feel intentional, not busy. Try to keep your look consistent across photos so your Etsy or Instagram grid feels cohesive.

**3️⃣ Capture both the story and the details.** Take a few wide shots that show your full candle and packaging, then zoom in on the details — label texture, flame glow, or wax finish. If you’re photographing a lit candle, use a faster shutter speed (or “Live” mode on your phone) to catch that flicker cleanly. And don’t forget to clean your jars and trim your wicks before shooting — tiny details make your photos feel professional.

Even with simple gear, a little attention to lighting and setup goes a long way!

If you’re prepping for the **holiday season** and need fresh product shots for your Etsy, website, or socials, I’m here to help, just comment :)

And I have dogs , so now when we go out she's constantly calling and saying they are barking or making noise ( we set up a camera and they barked 3x in a row probably because she got home and then stopped)

When I came home I apologized to his dad for the dogs (he's usually frustrated about it) he said they didn't make any noise at all. 

Now fast forward,
I'm allergic to onions (unless they are cooked)
The smell is so bad she burns them every day. 
Now the house does have mold so my bf thinks that's the reason my smell is heightened.

We met on an app and I was in another state at the time but we called every night and every felt really warm and fuzzy and how a relationship should feel at the beginning. The first year was amazing we met a few times I drove down to her and we had an amazing time but pretty much immediately while dating her I noticed that her family was struggling and would try to use me for their benefits and that she didn’t want me to go anywhere not out of loss of a boyfriend but a loss of support and aid. Anyway the next year was weird I moved down with her and her family and started working locally. I smoked a lot of weed with her everyday and we probably had some of the best times in that year. We got in a few fights and broke up once but we got back together because we felt we needed each other but things definitely started to feel different. The third year was a whole emotional boiling pot of feelings. We broke up twice and got back together and I moved away and started getting my life back together and then for some reason I send a DoorDash for coffee to her house one morning and then that was it we got back together until now. But things haven’t gotten better. Last year I went to Seattle to go to school for commercial diving and she came with me ofc.

It’s just an app that helps you find authentic spots, cafés, restaurants, museums, local landmarks all in one place.
Nothing fancy, just real places that are worth checking out.

You can also read what others say, share your own experiences, and discover places you probably didn’t even know existed.

I’m still working on adding a lot more features little by little, but it’s already pretty useful if you like exploring.

You can try it at www.NomadGO.info — it works from your phone, and soon it’ll be on iPhone and Android too.",6,1761174412.0,mongolia,4,1.0,False
1odnfjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1odnfjd/im_in_love_with_my_mother_in_law_and_its_killing/,I'm in love with my mother in law and it's killing me,"Obviously this is a throway account and I can't talk about this with anyone I know and who's got therapist money in this economy right? Maybe I just need to vent or have a bunch of people tell me how fucking stupid I am. I don't know. I'm sure a lot of this will come off as me justifying my feelings and maybe that is what I'm trying to do but I just can't hold this in any longer.

I want to start out by saying nothing has ever happened between us physically in case anyone jumps to that assumption. I wouldn't do that to my wife. At most I guess you could consider this situation to have been emotional cheating but I don't understand how you could reconcile an emotional connection with someone as ever being completely wrong. Maybe it's just the way that I'm beginning to feel about that connection. I do understand how fucked up this all is and believe me I feel like a real PoS.

Let me give some backstory. I 30M have been married to my wife 30F for 4 years and have been together for 8 total, so I have known my MIL 46F (she was very young when she had my wife it's not like I'm crushing on a granny) for that long too. 

This all started about 2 years ago. My MIL landed a new job that was very close to mine and our schedules lined up so she suggested that her and I start carpooling in order to save on gas. I was a bit hesitant at first since our relationship up to that  point had been kind of at an arms length. A lot of my early opinion of her had been shaped by my wife. I mentioned that she had her very young so it was a bit of a contentious childhood to say the least. My wife has held a lot of resentment and anger towards her over the years and a lot of that has been resurfacing now that MIL has two younger kids. My wife is I think justifiably upset that they are getting to experience the childhood and version of her mother that she rightfully should have. So like I said, a lot of my early opinion of her was shaped by that. I thought she was a selfish and vain person based off of the stories I had heard and my limited interactions with her.

As we began to spend so much time together carpooling every day I got to really know her and began to see that she is flawed individual that presents a hardened and tough exterior which can come off as standoffish and overly critical, but underneath that is an exceedingly kind person that is incredibly thoughtful and generous to her family and friends. We had several conversations about my wife's feelings and childhood and I was able to start seeing the whole picture. MIL was just a kid herself trying to navigate the world with her own child and she acknowledged she made a lot of mistakes that she didn't realize affected my wife so much. I have tried to mediate some sort of peace between them because I think they both owe each other some grace and to MIL's credit she has really tried to mend a lot of that trauma but my wife has not been receptive at all. Acts of kindness from her are usually met with suspicion and hostility and I can tell it deeply hurts her. I try not to take sides but occasionally when my wife is being especially unfair I will stick up for my MIL and it doesn't go over well. Don't get me wrong I also stick up for my wife too. It took me telling my MIL some hard truths for her to acknowledge her mistakes in the first place but in the end I think she has been grateful for that.

Like I was saying we were spending a lot of time getting to know each other carpooling every day for the better part of two years. We'd take turns paying for gas and getting eachother coffee. It was kind of awkward at first but after the first month or so we started building a rapport. At some point it just felt like we'd talk endlessly about everything and nothing. I knew all of the gossip at her work and she was a very attentive and thoughtful listener when I'd tell her about my day. We'd go grocery shopping together sometimes after work to give traffic time to die down and a few times we even made dinner together for us and the kids when my wife was out with friends and her husband was working late. I truly believe we became really good friends. 

This is the point when my stupid stupid lizard brain started to let the attraction slip in. I could always acknowledge that she is very beautiful even when I initially had a negative opinion of her. In fact, she is extraordinarily beautiful. The type of beauty that captivates any room that she enters and forces you to give her your full undivided attention. She is every great quality of my wife's physical beauty just accentuated. When we started dating my wife was very tomboyish and unapologetically herself which are qualities I found very attractive. MIL is the complete opposite, a real girly girl. At first I found it conceited and those traits are something I never thought I'd be into, but as time spent with her rolled on I began to appreciate the way she takes great pride and care in her beauty. The way she does her hair, her skin, her sense of fashion, just everything about her. She's 46 but doesn't look a day over 35. Once that sense of connection combined with the acknowledgement of her beauty the growing feelings of attraction became like a runaway freight train. I couldn't it stop it no matter how hard I tried.

Fast forward to the present time and we are no longer carpooling together. She got a promotion and along with it a new schedule. I have found myself missing her every morning and evening as I make that trek alone. I miss seeing her smiling face in the morning, trying to decipher her Starbucks order, the way we'd playing rock paper scissors to decide who dealt with the morning traffic and the little giggle she did whenever she won. I miss decompressing with her on the ride home and making her laugh uncontrollably when I'd make fun of the coworkers she doesn't like. I think the thing I miss the most is the sense of refuge I had with her. I know that this is the part that is the most unfair and it makes me a horrible person, but sometimes with my wife it feels like I am always walking on eggshells. Over the years she has become an even angrier and spiteful person and I bear the brunt of a lot of that. I know a lot of that probably is due to her unresolved childhood trauma and that is what makes this situation all the more fucked up and I feel an immense amount of guilt over that.

I truly do cherish the time I spent with my MIL though and I know she does too. One of the last days we rode together just happened to be her birthday. It was a Friday.  I surprised her with just this stupid little gift as I dropped her off at her office. It was nothing crazy just a little trinket type thing for her new workspace that I thought she'd appreciate. God the way that she looked at me in that moment...I thought I was going to melt right through the seat. I had the nauseous butterfly in your stomach feeling where it feels like you're simultaneously floating and made of lead. She told me right then that ""I was the only person in a long time that truly made her feel loved and appreciated"". Fuck. It took me fighting against every single cell in my body to not tell her how I feel about her but I think she already knows, and I think we both know that she shouldn't have said that. Her and her husband have their own issues and although I think he's overall a pretty great guy I don't think he's very attentive to her. Even her kids didn't tell her happy birthday that day. Maybe it was just a culmination of all those emotions and feelings of being underappreciated..but the way that she looked at me man.

Now I'm stuck in this weird space. Everytime I see her I get that sick butterfly feeling like I'm floating and sinking at the same time. I'm caught between an immense feeling of guilt and like I'm the worst person/husband to ever exist and a deep sense of yearning that I know will go forever unresolved. That all sounds like overly dramatic and romantic bullshit because that's probably what it is, and I guess I am an overly dramatic romantic asshole. I don't know what's wrong with me. It has me spiraling mentally right now and I don't know what to do. I find myself incredibly afraid of not just losing my wife but losing my MIL and her kids/wife's siblings. I haven't spoken much on them but I also deeply love those kids like they were my own blood relatives. I've known them sense they were born afterall. I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost all of them. This whole situation is just so fucked up and I hate myself so much for it.",0,1761174392.0,offmychest,1,0.5,False

1. We have learned that **Holy Kiwis** can foretell the exact moment BOLE decides to toy with our sanity.
2. That the **Goat** Prep is, in fact, our emotional support animal.
3. That **Grossman** is the only stable relationship we’ve had this entire bar season. He speaks. We listen. We still fail and hate Property.
4. That **Kathryn Robb** is our modern-day oracle, predicting the future, one essay at a time, but do we trust her? No. Do we still go running back? Absolutely.
5. That when your **BOLE portal turns grey**, your results are coming in 1-10 business days and you have either passed, failed, or entered a simulation designed by a sadistic IT intern who will ungrey it again (a few hours later) for ""funzies"".
6. That the **NY Court trick** is less a trick and more a collective act of delusion we all agreed to believe in.
7. And finally, that **BOLE** is somewhere, right now, sipping coffee, ignoring our phone calls, reading this subreddit, laughing while plotting their next act.

After going through this sub, I learned that my coffee grind was too coarse and made a difference. I went with a finer grind this time (but not too fine). I also saw some folks say to use hot water in the base, so I did that. I also turned the heat off when it got a little more than half way, which prevented any sputtering from overheating. The only mistake I made was closing the lid. The steam ruined the foam, which in hindsight I should have thought about lol.

1odn99p,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1odn99p/flair_58_is_my_favorite_machine/,Flair 58 is my favorite machine,"Got one for a few hundred bucks used.

~~I'm a little bit ADD~~ I have a great capacity for research, and I've tried the following machines during the years since the lockdowns (list of coffee roasting apparatuses I've used is similar lol, I just like exploring something until I fully get it)

* Cafelat robot
* Picopresso
* Flair Neo
* Flair signature with pro 2 upgrade
* Breville infuser
* Breville Barista Express
* Breville Duo Temp
* Breville Bambino Plus
* Gaggia classic pro

Robot I'd say is almost as good; just finding that with the 58 I am immediately pulling wildly amazing shots. Frankly I'd say they're better. Also come out warmer, which I didn't expect to do that much for me but it's a win for sure. But what I like is just the sweetness of the shots, to put it simply. The single lever works better for me, more casual to lean in on the one warm than pull down on the two (feels more aesthetic and natural)

Only downside is, someday I'm going to forgot to turn off the heating element. It doesn't use that much power (I'm on solar most of the time, and ie my bambino plus just shuts down because it thinks it's not getting enough juice or something, even though I have vastly more power than needed and have tried multiple 3000 watt inverters; the 58 sips power compared to a regular machine), and it doesn't seem to be all that fire hazardy. But it will drain my solar system batteries noticeably if I left it on all day.

Other than that, I really like the form, design, look, and feel of it. As far as the the sub $1000 machines on my list above, I don't know how anyone would possibly choose any of those over a robot or a 58 unless their goal isn't just espresso. Not even a close comparison, by a long long shot. Though the GCP etc shots, BBE shots, they're *deep* \- not the quality taste tone sweetness fullness, etc, but to me they produce rocket booster fuel pretty successfully, with non delicate raw power vibes.

Oddly, I still have the bambino plus, which works out perfectly- when I get off my current solar set up and can use it, going to use the hell out of that auto froth feature, alongside my flair 58 shots (I don't drink milk drinks often, but cool to be able to offer them). I don't think you can get much of a better set up than that, no matter the price range you're shopping in.

Male, 24, 175 pounds 5ft11

First of all, thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this. Any help would be appreciated 

I have been an avid hobby runner for the past 10 years, ranging from 2 mile to 8 mile runs, with the occasional half marathon distance. The majority of this running has been on pavement, but in recent years I have mixed in some trail running. 

This year I had a big lifestyle change, I started working in an office over the summer for an internship, and I was commuting around 2 1/2 hours + combined per day, so a lot of sitting. 1 - 2 times a week I would do a 2 mile pavement run or a 3 mile trail run at a fast pace to blow off steam, but besides that I was not doing anything to strengthen my legs. 

In contrast, this spring I was in college where I would walk 2 miles a day minimum, I worked in a coffee shop where I was on my feet all day, and did a lot of hiking, trail running, strength conditioning. 

With that context out of the way, my life has settled down a bit, I am married, in a nice home, graduated and working a traveling sales job, so I don’t have to sit at a desk for 8+ hours a day. 
The only issue is that my knees, specifically my left, start to hurt after mile 2, and recently have been hurting after walking through airports and when squatting down to pick things up. 
They also click when I walk after sitting for a while. 

My theory is that i have gained about 7-10 pounds, while having less activity and not strengthening my calves, which has given my knees more stress and led me to where I am today. 

My strategy is to put myself in a milk caloric deficit, stop running for a few weeks, and strengthen my legs using exercises that don’t strain my knees, while potentially maintaining some cardio on my bicycle. 

Besides this, are there any items are specifics that I could be missing? I just want to be able to enjoy my favorite stress reliever again, and not have it be something stressful itself. ",1,1761173919.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
