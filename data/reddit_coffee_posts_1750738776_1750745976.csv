I‘m really trying,"I’ve always had a harder time making friends, even as a kid since I’m very introverted and kinda shy. In my teens I had a couple of friends in school but I was never close with them because I didn’t drink or party and that’s all they did. So I was always missing out and essentially we grew apart and I wasn’t invited to anything anymore. When I started university I thought now was finally the right time and I was going to make friends with similar interests but then covid happened. And when covid ended I started my masters degree with all new people. I really tried putting myself out there, going up to people and starting conversations, I’ve also had people coming up to me and starting conversations with me but somehow it never ended in any friendships. Now there’s this one girl who always talks to me after class and I really like her and thought that maybe we could be friends. We also started walking to the bus together and we shared some more personal stuff or well at least I opened up. Today we had class together again and I wanted to chat with her as this has somewhat become a habit for us and I was walking up to her, got interrupted by my professor, but I could hear in the background that she invited two other girls (with whom I never really see her talking much to) for coffee. When I talked to her, I thought she might invite me too but it never happened. Later I texted her and asked what she was doing the day she invited those girls for coffee to see if maybe she would invite me too as we all have the same class that day. But she just said she was busy, so she clearly doesn’t want me there. I know this all sounds kinda pathetic but it’s just so frustrating because why does this always happen to me (similar things happen all the time)? What am I doing wrong? I’m friendly and I’m not pushy. Am I giving off a weird vibe? I really don’t get it cause they chat with me but they never invite me to anything and when I initiate something, they give weird responses. I know I have my family and boyfriend and I’m not lonely but I’m not going to lie, it would be nice if I had a few girlfriends as well. And I’m kinda frustrated cause at this point I really just want to know what I’m doing wrong.

1lj3okk,https://i.redd.it/dilstq62it8f1.jpeg,Let’s talk about Roy,"Roy’s character arc deserves a deeper look, especially since he goes from being kind of a jerk to someone who actually learns and grows. Overtime he has won me over and became one of my favorite characters. At first glance, Roy Anderson seems like a one-dimensional character—Dunder Mifflin’s resident warehouse guy and Pam Beesly’s longtime fiancé who just doesn’t “get it.” He’s disengaged, immature, and often inconsiderate. Personality-wise, Roy is a classic example of someone who’s stuck in a comfort zone. He’s used to a routine, resistant to change, and uncomfortable with emotional vulnerability. Roy becomes more interesting is after Pam leaves him. Unlike many side characters in sitcoms, Roy isn’t discarded—he’s given the chance to evolve. When he reappears in Season 9, he’s nearly unrecognizable. He owns his own gravel company, dresses sharply, and—most importantly—shows signs of emotional intelligence. He’s happily married to a woman who shares his interests, and he even plays the piano, surprising Pam and the audience alike. He’s not just reformed—he’s grown. Roy’s arc is subtle, but it says a lot: growth is possible, even for those who once seemed stuck. He’s proof that not everyone is meant to stay in your story, but that doesn’t mean they’re doomed to remain the worst version of themselves. Roy started as an obstacle in Pam’s journey, but he finished as someone who found his own path.

Rethinking Roy Anderson: Maybe He Wasn’t the Villain After All

Roy from The Office is often painted as the classic “bad boyfriend”—the warehouse guy who held Pam back while Jim was painted as the romantic hero. But when you look a little deeper, things aren’t so black and white. Maybe—just maybe—Pam wasn’t entirely blameless either.

Roy and Pam were both young and unsure of who they were when they got engaged. They didn’t communicate well, but that wasn’t just on Roy. Pam often kept her thoughts and feelings to herself, hoping Roy would just understand. Meanwhile, Roy wasn’t emotionally tuned in, but that doesn’t make him a bad guy—it makes him human. He had his faults, but he also had heart.

People forget Roy could be romantic. He pursued Pam with genuine effort in the beginning. He wanted to marry her, even if it took him a while to get serious. When he realized he was losing her, he tried. Eventually had that moment of painful realization that trying isn’t always enough if there’s no mutual growth. What makes Roy’s story special is what he does after their breakup. He doesn’t spiral into bitterness or become some cliché of the jealous ex. Instead, he grows up. When we see him years later, he’s successful, confident, and emotionally mature. The coffee shop scene between him and Pam isn’t just a quiet goodbye—it’s a beautiful, understated moment of closure. It shows that Roy finally understood what really mattered: not forcing something to work, but learning to let go with grace.

I love my girl, Pam, but she made a lot of mistakes and we can’t put the complete blame on Roy. Roy and Pam’s relationship had a lot of cracks, but many of those came from poor communication on both sides. Roy was emotionally closed off at times, yes, but Pam also held back. She often kept her real feelings buried, expecting Roy to read her mind. That kind of emotional distance made it impossible for either of them to truly grow together. We love Pam—she’s relatable, kind, and wonderfully awkward—but what she did wasn’t perfect either. She lied to herself for years, avoided difficult conversations, led Jim on emotionally while still engaged, and ultimately cheated on Roy, even if it was quietly and without immediate physical action. That betrayal still mattered. Despite everything, Roy wasn’t a bad guy. He had his flaws, but he also had heart. He pursued Pam with sincerity. He tried to be romantic in his own way. When he sensed he was losing her, he made efforts—imperfect ones, but efforts nonetheless—to win her back. He didn’t always know how to be the partner she needed, but it’s clear he cared.

Roy’s character arc is proof that people can change—not to win someone back, but to become better for themselves. Maybe Roy wasn’t the perfect guy for Pam, but he was never the villain. He was just someone figuring life out in his own way, and by the end, he got there. Just a man who made mistakes, learned from them, and chose to become something more. ❤️

Have you ever found yourself running on the treadmill of life, thinking, “Is this all there is?” 🚀 I used to feel that way until I realized that **retirement isn’t just an end; it’s actually a new beginning—a blank canvas just waiting for your brush strokes**. 

What if I told you there’s a whole world out there that thrives on the art of slow living? Yeah, like really! Think of it as *life at a pace that’s just right for you*. Kind of dreamy, right? 🌈 

Here’s why you should consider embracing this approach as you step into the golden years:

- **You Define the Structure**: No more 9 to 5 grind! You can wake up with the sun or hit snooze for an hour. Your day's rhythm is in your hands. What would your ideal day look like? *Coffee in the garden? An early morning walk?*

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Slow living is all about savoring moments. Instead of rushing through bucket lists, focus on enriching experiences. Think leisurely dinners with loved ones or reading a book that’s been collecting dust on your shelf. What’s on your “want to enjoy” list?

- **Mindful Moments**: Take time to breathe. Yep, just breathe! Practice mindfulness to really connect with your surroundings. Whether it’s feeling the sun on your skin or simply enjoying the sound of rustling leaves, those moments spark joy. 

- **Reconnect with Passions**: What was your passion before life got busy? Gardening, painting, playing an instrument? Retirement gives you time to pick those dreams back up! Maybe even learn something new?   
  
- **Simplifying Stuff**: You know that stuff that piles up from years of working? A garage of memories that you’ve forgotten? Now’s your chance to declutter both your space and your mind. What do you truly need that elevates your day?

- **Community Connection**: Get involved! Whether it's joining a local book club or volunteering, it's easier to connect with folks who share your interests when you’re not on a time crunch. What community activities are on your radar?

It’s truly liberating to realize that **retirement empowers people to choose how they live as they age**. Step out of the rush and take a stroll through your passions—because life is short, why not savor it?

Amidst all this, it’s super important to be aware of how you can empower yourself. (Psst... check out [this link](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb) for some neat tools that can help you create the retirement you’ve always wanted. 🌟)

It was a mixed week in terms of scoring for most, with some key players returning to form, others going missing or getting injured, and one suffering the equivalent of a tag in the Ruck (Xerri). With the last week of the Byes we will hopefully be finishing our final 22nd or 23rd premo before we move back to best 22 scoring next week. Given how few trades most people have remaining, the decision of when and how to use them is critical, and while the specific number of trades we should keep will vary from team to team, the general advice is to ensure you are comfortable that you have enough for injury cover in the latter portion of the season. It may not be worth it to sideways trade a premo who's in poor form at the moment if it leaves you vulnerable and unable to cover a season-ending injury to one of your best players.


**DEFENDERS** 


**Mills - 395K**, was brilliant last week in the main distribution role off half back, having displaced Roberts to the wing and Bice to the bench. Given his exceptional performance it is difficult to see him being shifted around to the wing/mid with the current mix of players as the swans look to make a push to finish top 8, which is promising for his prospects as a genuine premo in the backline. At 395K with a BE of 5 he is a steal, and he could well be priced 440K+ next week so now is the time to bring him in.


**Rozee - 533K**, dipped a bit in scoring last week owing to injuries to Bergman, JHF, and Wines that necessitated an increase in mid-time for Rozee. If there are no injury concerns with the port mids then Rozee should return to the backline and capitalise on good match-ups against CAR and WCE over the next few weeks. Port don't have the easiest fixture to finish the year, but he has demonstrated a capacity to score well against decent teams with scores of 134 against ADE and 116 against GWS.


**Wanganeen-Milera - 550K**, has averaged 121 over the last 4 games and has a brilliant run home with upcoming matches against MEL/NTH/RIC/ESS. From a price perspective he should stabilise in the 550-590K range but he should go up another 30K over the next few weeks so now is a great time to bring him in if you already have Mills or would like someone who could score a bit more reliably with favourable upcoming match-ups.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


Flashbacks to 2023.


**Sicily - 418K**, with the potential return from an injury that has clearly been hampering him for much of the season, we may finally get a look at what a healthy Sicily looks like and how that translates to scoring. The sane play is to wait until after this week to see if he is actually fit and firing before making the trade, but he could well hit his BE of 125 against North Melbourne which would be a handy score in a difficult Bye round.


**Ryan - 535K**, has put together a remarkable run of form with an average of 118 across the previous 7 games, and has been the primary player on kick-in duties for Freo. Given his recent form and his historical status as a 600K+ player, providing you're blessed with an excess of trades and an already complete team, then he could be a luxury sideways trade from an underperforming premo. He's only 5% owned so would be a great POD, but this is really the only week to bring him in given his BE of 55.


**MIDFIELDERS**


There's not a lot of value to be found in the midfield at the moment unfortunately. There's two uber premos in **Bontempelli** and **Butters** priced at **586K**, who have achievable breakevens of 102 and 114 respectively, which means they're only ~30K more expensive than the ""value"" options available this week, and aren't likely to get significantly cheaper any time soon. If you have neither, Bont should be the first priority given the phenomenal run home against NTH/ESS/MEL/WCE and 6 out of 9 games to be played at Marvel. If you have one then I would strongly recommend finding a way to bring the other in. If you have both, then you could ~~wait until next week for Dunkley/Neale/Caldwell~~ consider:


**Liberatore - 547K**, has had a drop in his scoring over the previous three weeks as a consequence of swapping his midfield minutes (previously ~75% CBAs) with Bontempelli's (~55%). Despite this he's still scoring well sitting at M7 and he's every chance to regain his CBAs if Bont is tagged in upcoming games against SYD/BRL/ESS/MEL, and he has the favourable WBD run home. I don't love the pick if you need a 547K MID to finish your team this week, then Liberatore is your man.


**Hewett - 552K**, probably has a slightly higher scoring potential than Libba on current form/role, but Carlton have a worse fixture to round out the year. It's astounding that he's averaging 115 (the 6th highest of any mid) and is only 9% owned.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


I don't have any faith this pick, but wouldn't that make it all the more satisfying if it pays off?


**Newcombe - 478K**, has scored poorly owing to a mix of form and feeling the effect of being the number 1 mid (with Will Day out) in the tagging renaissance period. He has a decent run against NTH/STK/CAR/MEL to end the year, and with the imminent return of Worpel to draw attention from the opposition there's a chance he's not neutered by Windhager next week, so he could be a reasonable option at a 70K discount to finish your midfield.


**RUCKS**


If you have cash to burn and want to ensure you're competitive in the ruck slot to finish the year, you'll want to ensure you have two (or three) of the top performing rucks. I've separated all the relevant rucks into four tiers in order to list all the options available given that there's some anticipated variance in scoring/pricing that isn't reflected in their current prices, so choose your inclusions according to available funds and trade timing. Long story short - this week go for Grundy if you have plenty of cash, otherwise go for Cameron.


*The Big Four / The 645K+ Club*


You can't sit with us.


**Jackson - 645K**, every week I regret more and more that I advised against picking Jackson in Round 11. The threat of Darcy taking more of the ruck contests persists despite him being rested against the Bombers, and Jackson's scoring does cool slightly to ~100-110 with Darcy in the team compared to the 140+ when he's solo ruck. He has a BE of 94, a great run home, and can take the forward slot with DPP (to be honest if you pick him it should probably be as a forward), so he's a fine pick if there's signs that Darcy won't be a regular feature in the team.


**Grundy - 662K**, has gone under the radar this year with selection in only in 2.6% of teams, and has a 5-round average of 143. If you have cash to burn and have to bring in a ruck this week then Grundy would be my pick. He has a BE of 76, he's a POD, and he has an amazing run home from round 21.


**Xerri - 674K**, with a BE of 213 he should drop by ~50K over the next couple of weeks, so if you have the capacity to wait a few weeks then you could look to bring him in in round 18 against Gawn. Hold off this week.


**Gawn - 678K**, he has a BE of 142 and challenging opponents over the next three weeks with Witts/O'Brien/Xerri may drop his price, so the ideal plan if you want to bring him in would be round 19 given that to end the year he has an amazing run against CAR/STK/WCE.


*On The Periphery*


**Cameron - 554K**, if you're bringing in a ruck this week and don't want to pay up then it should be Cameron. He has a BE of 58 and is about to play WCE, so he could be priced 620K+ in two weeks time. He's also a POD given 9.6% ownership, and provides a captain option this week.


**English - 585K**, has a difficult next three weeks against Grundy/Xerri/O'Brien and is priced 30K higher than Cameron, so it would be prudent to hold off and wait to bring him un against BRL/ESS in Round 19 or 20 if you wanted him.


*Pittonetted*


**T De Koning - 560K**, Pittonet spoiled the party last week in a strategic move to use two Rucks to neutralise Xerri. Despite Pittonet playing terribly, the move was unfortunately successful meaning that we could see it employed again against top-tier opposition. This looks most likely in round 17 against Cameron and round 19 against Gawn. If you have TDK already it's probably worth holding if TDK is named as solo ruck this week. If you have him and Pittonet is named again and you have plentiful trades, it would be very much worth considering trading him sideways to an equivalent scorer in Cameron, or upgrading him to Grundy.


*Value Picks*


**Meek - 475K**, if you're absolutely strapped for cash and need a second ruck, then Meek is a reasonable pick at a decent price given his BE of 45, but it's probably worth paying up for someone with better scoring potential.


**Marshall - 502K**, seems like the Ruck-equivalent of Rowell or Warner with the cyclical runs of high and low scoring. He's got a mix of decent and difficult opposition upcoming and has a high ceiling, so if you're enthused about the prospect of a rollercoaster pick then this is the one for you.


**FORWARDS**


**Darcy - 459K**, with a stellar return from injury we saw a static price following a score of 144 against Richmond last week, however with a BE 19 this may well be the last time we have Darcy available below 500K. The general rule to avoid selecting full forwards has had a few notable exceptions over the years (see: Hawkins, Franklin, and Curnow/Hogan/Cameron to a lesser extent), but this may be another to add to the list. With the combination of a firing WBD midfield that can deliver the ball to Darcy at pace and height, and the occasional stint in the ruck where he can generate clearances and hitouts-to-advantage, Darcy has a reasonable 75+ floor and a 140+ ceiling and looks to be cementing his place as a premier forward in the competition. He's my pick for best FWD inclusion this week, and is tied with Mills for best pick of the round. 


**Horne-Francis - 472K**, looked to be hampered by his sore shoulder throughout the game last week, potentially explaining his absence from the midfield. The coaching staff have said that he'll be fine to play this week and that the shoulder is improving, so there's a good chance we see him more in the mid this week especially with Wines a possibility to miss this week. He'll still be around 50K unless he scores unreasonably well against CAR and BRL the next two weeks, so if you can't find a way to get him this week with all the other value on offer, then you could bring him in round 18 ahead of the WCE game. He's in contention to finish F3-F5 so he's a player you should look to get into your team when you can.


**Macrae - 493K**, at 30K more expensive than Darcy, Macrae has a similar floor and ceiling but is looking like a more reliable scorer given the high CBAs/tackles/contested possessions, and he's evidently no longer under the influence of injury. It would be ideal to have both in your team, but if you can only bring in one this week you could pick Darcy if you're wanting to make a bit of a gamble to gain ranks, or Macrae if you're looking for a reliable F3-F5 to round out the team. He would be the best inclusion in any other week that didn't have Mills and Darcy available with low BEs.


*Speculative Forward Picks*


Once Moore, with feeling.


**Moore - 429K**, looked to be moving slower to start the year, potentially playing through injury, but was back to his best last week and scored 162. With a probable slaughter of NTH in Tasmania this week then he's every chance to go 130+. If he does this then he'll gaining near 100K over the next two weeks, which means that not only is he a decent pick who should score well as the Hawks push for a top 4 finish but also that he's a decent short-term play (who could potentially be flipped to someone like JHF in round 18 against WCE if you're one of the few with 10+ trades remaining).


**ROOKIES**


Another reminder this week that if you're low on trades (sub 6 or thereabouts) there's a realistic chance that any rookie that you bring in will stay in the side until the end of the season. This means we either want them to 1. offer a decent on field score, or 2. provide an adequate score each week (>60) as cover on the bench for a short term injury, or 3. provide maximal value trading them in (ie priced at 99K). 120-150K players who may have 2 ~30K price increases before being dropped or used permanently as the sub and scoring <30 fulfil none of these criteria.


**McCarthy - DEF/MID - 99K**, has a BE of -93 after a single game, and truly looked the goods as he was BOG for WCE with 31 disposals (10 kickins), 2 intercept marks, and 9 contested possessions. If he keeps this role then optimistically he could fill the 23rd/flex spot, but more realistically he'll be someone we can keep as cover on the bench and loop in as required, both of which are phenomenal returns for a 99K player. He has to come in by next week, but if for whatever reason you can't get him in this week then it's fine to wait given he's not yet on the bubble.


**Butler - FWD - 126K**, has played reasonably well over the previous two matches and now has a BE of -50. If he stays in the side he could reach 230K+ after round 18, but his job security is a concern given the imminent return of Worpel, MacKenzie, and eventually Day. I would only bring him in if you think you can upgrade him on/after Round 19.


**Liddy - MID - 99K**, a BE of -35 with poor job security and scoring potential, but he's at least a body on the field if you need someone extra for this Bye round. He's 99K so satisfies the criteria of extracting maximum value for a trade out, but I can't see the selection amounting to anything more.


For your consideration I will also list the four other 99K DPP players as potential trade ins over the coming weeks given that they offer additional flexibility as a loophole player.


**Charleson - DEF/MID - 99K**, **Nguyen - DEF/MID - 99K**, **Mentha - DEF/FWD - 99K**, **Mackinlay - MID/FWD - 99K**. Of these, you ideally want to pick loophole players that have more games later in the week (so that they can be moved on the field and captained to facilitate getting the VC points), although that being said with the amount of dead rookies in the team I don't imaging most sides are lacking a loophole option.


As always, please let me know what you think of the options above, if there's any other trade options you're considering, and if there's anything else you'd like to see in these write-ups.",2,1750745340.0,AFLSupercoach,0,1.0,False

i'm getting more into coffee and am looking for a pour over brewer. i already have an AeroPress XL, scale (0.1 gram) and grind (Kingrinder K6). I was recommended to go with a flat brewer as a beginner rather than a conical one, since it would be more forgiving. I was considering the Hario Pegasus as a beginner to pour over since its a flat brewer and only $10 but wanted opinions on it. I was thinking of getting a size 3 because I usually drink 12 oz (354 ml) of coffee in the morning, and usually once a week make a batch for my fiance and which would be double that. I read some people's opinions on it here but was looking for more. 

Right now im using cheap beans for the aeropress (8 o clock) so I don't know much about flavor profiles yet. I did order some beans from a roaster that i'm waiting for. One set has notes of Milk Chocolate, Apple and Brown Sugar. The other has notes of Milk Chocolate, Flower and Honey. I think both are medium to medium dark roasts.

1lj3hen,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lj3hen,culture and landscape/weather is a character?,"Hello all, let me first say that this subreddit is my new obsession. I hope to articulate this properly. 

I’d love to pick your brains on books where landscape/weather and culture are characters. I believe it is referred to as an atmospheric novel? I want to feel the cold, I want to think about what it’s like to take the sip of tea and coffee after being caught in the freezing cold rain. I want to feel like I’m in France if the character is at a cafe. I want authors who take the time to bring the landscape and culture into the story as a character.

I don’t want it to be about the culture or landscape, I want it to be its own character. Rather than just having a story be set somewhere, let’s say Scotland and telling a story, the author incorporates the feel of the place by bringing in mention of the rain, the cold, the warm tea, etc. I feel Charles Finch does a good job of this. 

I love authors who write amazing compelling books, but take care to truly wrap you in the culture and weather/landscape of the place as well.

Bonus points if it’s set in France, Ireland, or the UK and preferably nonfiction.

It’s hard to select a picture for this. I love Victorian London, moody Ireland/Scotland, all of France as locations/setting. It can be detective, murder/mystery, scary, suspense, stolen art, doesn’t matter. Les Miserable is one of my favorite books. Albert Camus is one of my favorite authors. 

Really looking forward to your recommendations. Thanks!",2,1750745013.0,BooksThatFeelLikeThis,1,1.0,False

**The Daily Life of a Nomad: Between Chaos and Calm**

The nomadic lifestyle is not just a trend—it’s a tectonic shift in how we live, work, and connect. Forget the nine-to-five, the cubicle, the commute. Nomads rewrite the rules, trading stability for serendipity, comfort for curiosity. But what does a day in the life of a nomad really look like? Buckle up—this is the unfiltered, unvarnished truth.

**Waking Up in a New Place: The Morning Routine**

Every sunrise is a fresh start in a new city, a new culture, a new story. The nomad’s morning is a dance of micro-adaptations. Time zones blur. Coffee is sacred. The first task? Recalibrating—body, mind, and Wi-Fi.

**Micro-Adaptations: Adjusting to New Time Zones and Environments**

Jet lag is the nomad’s silent alarm clock. Some days, you wake before dawn, wired and restless. Other days, you snooze through sunrise, body still tethered to yesterday’s longitude. Adaptation is key. Blackout curtains. Noise-canceling headphones. A ritual of stretching, meditation, or a brisk walk—whatever it takes to sync with the local rhythm.

**The Ritual of Digital Detox and Focus**

Before the inbox explodes, nomads carve out moments of focus. No notifications, no distractions. A digital detox—brief but potent—sets the tone for productivity. The world can wait. For now, it’s just you and your mission.

**Finding Your Tribe: Community and Connection**

Loneliness is the nomad’s shadow, but community is the antidote. Coworking spaces are the new water coolers—places to swap stories, share tips, and find collaborators. Meetups and events transform strangers into allies. The nomad’s network is global, fluid, and fiercely supportive.

**Coworking Spaces: The New Office**

Forget the corner office. The nomad’s workspace is wherever the Wi-Fi is strong. Coworking hubs are melting pots of ambition and creativity. Here, ideas collide, partnerships form, and productivity soars. The vibe is electric—part office, part social club.

**Meetups and Events: Networking on the Fly**

Nomads thrive on serendipity. A chance encounter at a rooftop bar. A workshop in a converted warehouse. Every event is a chance to expand your circle, learn a new skill, or find your next adventure.

**Workspace Wrangling: Productivity on the Go**

Productivity is a moving target. Nomads master the art of workspace wrangling—turning cafes, libraries, and hotel lobbies into makeshift offices. The right tech stack is non-negotiable. Gadgets and apps are the nomad’s lifeline.

**Nomadic Tech Stack: Gadgets and Apps**

From noise-canceling headphones to portable chargers, nomads pack light but smart. Apps for translation, currency, and navigation are indispensable. The cloud is your hard drive. Collaboration tools keep teams in sync, no matter the time zone.

**Battling Wi-Fi Woes: The Nomad’s Nemesis**

Wi-Fi is the nomad’s oxygen. Yet, it’s often elusive—slow, spotty, or password-protected. Savvy nomads scout locations in advance, carry backup hotspots, and know which cafes have the fastest connection. When the network fails, patience and a backup plan are your best allies.

**Food and Fuel: Eating Like a Local**

Nomads eat to explore. Street food is the quick fix—tacos in Mexico, banh mi in Vietnam, kebabs in Istanbul. But cooking in tiny kitchens is its own adventure. Grocery hacks and one-pot meals keep you fueled and frugal.

**Street Food: The Quick Fix**

Street food is the nomad’s fuel station. It’s cheap, fast, and packed with flavor. Every bite is a taste of local life—spicy, sweet, or savory. The risk? The occasional stomach rebellion. The reward? Authentic experiences and unforgettable flavors.

**Grocery Hacks: Cooking in Tiny Kitchens**

Most nomad digs come with a kitchenette—mini-fridge, two-burner stove, and a single pan. Creativity is key. One-pot wonders, prepped salads, and instant noodles are staples. The goal? Eat well, spend less, and savor the adventure.

**Transportation Tactics: Getting Around**

Nomads are perpetual motion machines. Public transit, rideshares, scooters—every city has its rhythm. The art of packing light is non-negotiable. Every gram counts. The nomad’s bag is a curated capsule of essentials.

**Public Transit vs. Rideshares**

Subways, buses, trams—public transit is the nomad’s classroom. It’s cheap, efficient, and a window into local life. Rideshares are the backup plan—when you’re lost, tired, or running late. Both have their place in the nomad’s toolkit.

**The Art of Packing Light**

Overpacking is the nomad’s cardinal sin. Every item must earn its place. Versatile clothing, compact toiletries, and a reliable backpack are the essentials. The lighter the load, the freer the journey.

**Accommodation: Where to Rest Your Head**

Nomads sleep where the adventure leads. Hostels, Airbnbs, coliving spaces—each has its vibe. Digital nomad villages are the new frontier—communities built for remote workers, with coworking, events, and instant friends.

**Hostels, Airbnbs, and Coliving Spaces**

Hostels are social hubs—cheap, cheerful, and chaotic. Airbnbs offer privacy and comfort. Coliving spaces blend the best of both—community, convenience, and curated experiences. The choice depends on your mood, budget, and mission.

**The Rise of Digital Nomad Villages**

Digital nomad villages are popping up worldwide—Bali, Lisbon, Tbilisi. These are communities designed for remote workers, with coworking, events, and a built-in support network. It’s nomadism, upgraded.

**Work-Life Balance: Drawing Boundaries**

Nomads blur the line between work and play. Time management is the key to sanity. The myth of perpetual vacation is just that—a myth. Burnout is real. Boundaries are essential.

**Time Management: The Nomad’s Clock**

Nomads live by their own clock. Some work early, some late. The key is consistency—blocking time for work, rest, and exploration. Productivity apps and time trackers help keep you on track.

**Burnout and the Myth of Perpetual Vacation**

The nomadic life is not a never-ending holiday. Work is still work. Burnout lurks around every corner. Self-care, routines, and honest self-assessment are the nomad’s armor.

**Financial Fluidity: Managing Money Across Borders**

Money moves with the nomad. Currency conversion, hidden fees, and tax implications are constant companions. Financial fluency is a survival skill.

**Currency Conversion and Hidden Fees**

Exchange rates and bank fees can eat into your budget. Wise, Revolut, and local ATMs are the nomad’s financial toolkit. Always check the fine print.

**Tax Implications for Global Citizens**

Taxes get complicated when you’re everywhere and nowhere. Digital nomad visas, double taxation treaties, and professional advice are essential. Ignorance is not bliss.

**Health and Wellness: Staying Fit and Sane**

Nomads prioritize health—physical and mental. Yoga on the go, portable fitness routines, and mental health strategies keep you balanced.

**Yoga on the Go: Portable Fitness**

Yoga mats, resistance bands, and bodyweight workouts fit in any bag. Fitness is a mindset, not a location. Parks, beaches, and hotel rooms become your gym.

**Mental Health: Isolation and Coping Strategies**

Loneliness and isolation are real risks. Regular calls home, meditation, and community support are lifelines. Mental health is as important as physical health.

**Language and Culture: Navigating New Worlds**

Nomads are perpetual students of language and culture. Survival phrases, local etiquette, and cultural immersion are part of the adventure.

**Survival Phrases and Local Etiquette**

A few key phrases go a long way. “Hello,” “thank you,” and “where’s the bathroom?” are essentials. Respect for local customs opens doors and hearts.

**The Joy of Cultural Immersion**

Nomads don’t just visit—they live. Markets, festivals, and local traditions are the real highlights. Cultural immersion is the nomad’s reward.

**Security and Safety: Risk Management**

Nomads are savvy risk managers. Digital security, physical safety, and common sense are the nomad’s toolkit.

**Digital Security: VPNs and Privacy**

Public Wi-Fi is a minefield. VPNs, password managers, and two-factor authentication are non-negotiable. Privacy is power.

**Physical Safety: Scams and Scares**

Scams, pickpockets, and unsafe neighborhoods are real. Vigilance, local advice, and trust in your instincts keep you safe.

**Leisure and Exploration: The Nomad’s Playground**

Nomads are explorers at heart. Hidden gems, off-the-beaten-path adventures, and storytelling are part of the journey.

**Hidden Gems: Off-the-Beaten-Path Adventures**

Tourist traps are for tourists. Nomads seek the hidden—secret beaches, local markets, and underground art scenes. The real magic is off the map.

**Photography and Storytelling: Capturing the Journey**

Every nomad is a storyteller. Photos, blogs, and social media posts are the nomad’s legacy. The journey is the story.

**Sustainable Nomading: Reducing Your Footprint**

Nomads care about the planet. Eco-friendly travel, supporting local economies, and reducing waste are part of the ethos.

**Eco-Friendly Travel Tips**

Reusable bottles, public transit, and mindful consumption are the nomad’s creed. Every choice matters.

**Supporting Local Economies**

Nomads invest in local businesses—markets, cafes, and artisans. Your spending supports communities and builds bridges.

**Challenges of Nomadic Life: The Flip Side**

Nomadism is not all sunsets and coconuts. Loneliness, visa issues, and legal hurdles are real challenges.

**Loneliness and the Search for Stability**

Rootlessness can be isolating. Nomads crave connection and stability. Building a routine and a support network is essential.

**Visa Issues and Legal Hurdles**

Visa runs, paperwork, and bureaucracy are part of the journey. Research, patience, and professional advice are your allies.

**Success Stories: Inspiration from the Road**

Nomads are pioneers. Their stories inspire, educate, and motivate.

**Profiles of Noteworthy Nomads**

From bloggers to entrepreneurs, nomads are rewriting the rules. Their journeys are proof that the impossible is possible.

**Lessons Learned from Long-Term Travelers**

Experience is the best teacher. Long-term nomads share hard-won wisdom—practical, personal, and profound.

**Tools of the Trade: Essential Resources**

Nomads rely on a curated toolkit—apps, gear, and communities.

**Apps for Every Need**

From language learning to navigation, apps are the nomad’s Swiss Army knife. The right tool for every challenge.

**The Best Nomad Gear**

Lightweight, durable, and versatile—the best gear is worth its weight in gold. Backpacks, adapters, and noise-canceling headphones are essentials.

**Future Trends: The Evolution of Nomadic Living**

Nomadism is evolving. Remote work policies, new destinations, and global shifts are reshaping the landscape.

**Remote Work Policies and Global Shifts**

Companies are embracing remote work. Governments are rolling out digital nomad visas. The future is borderless.

**The Next Generation of Nomad Destinations**

Emerging hubs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the new frontiers. The nomad’s map is always expanding.

**Conclusion: Is the Nomadic Lifestyle Right for You?**

Nomadism is not for everyone. It’s a life of freedom, challenge, and discovery. The only way to know? Try it.

**Call to Adventure: Your Next Steps**

The world is waiting. Pack your bag, fire up your laptop, and take the first step. The nomadic life is yours for the taking.

1lj3dbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DentistinCamberwell/comments/1lj3dbk/home_remedies_for_tooth_sensitivity_that_actually/,Home Remedies for Tooth Sensitivity That Actually Work,"Do you feel a sharp twinge when you sip a hot coffee or enjoy an ice-cold drink? If so, you’re not alone. **Tooth sensitivity** is a common dental issue that can sneak up on anyone. The good news is, there are some gentle and effective home remedies you can try to ease the discomfort—right from your bathroom cabinet.

At **Imperial Dental**, your trusted  [**dentist  in Camberwell**](https://imperialdental.com.au/), we care about your comfort and want to share a few easy ways you can manage sensitive teeth at home.

# But First, Why Are My Teeth So Sensitive?

Tooth sensitivity usually happens when **the protective layer (enamel)** on your teeth wears down or your **gums recede**, exposing the softer inner part of your tooth (dentin). This makes your teeth more sensitive to temperature, sweet foods, or even brushing.

# Home Remedies That Can Help

Here are some tried-and-true remedies that many people find helpful for easing tooth sensitivity:

# 1. Use a Sensitivity Toothpaste

There are plenty of over-the-counter toothpastes specially made for sensitive teeth. These contain ingredients like **potassium nitrate** or **stannous fluoride**, which help block the pathways to the tooth’s nerves.

**Tip:** Use it twice a day and give it at least a week or two to feel the difference.

# 2. Switch to a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush

Hard bristles can wear down enamel and make sensitivity worse. Try using a **soft-bristled brush** and gentle circular motions instead of scrubbing.

# 3. Rinse with Salt Water

Salt is a natural antiseptic and can reduce inflammation. Mix **half a teaspoon of salt in warm water** and swish it around your mouth for 30 seconds.

Do this once or twice a day—it’s easy and effective.

# 4. Try a Fluoride Rinse

Fluoride helps strengthen enamel and reduce sensitivity. You can find **fluoride mouth rinses** at most pharmacies. Use once daily before bed.

# 5. Avoid Acidic Foods and Drinks

Citrus fruits, soda, wine, and vinegar-based foods can wear down enamel. Try cutting back on these or **rinsing your mouth with water afterward** to reduce their effects.

# 6. Clove Oil for Quick Relief

Clove oil has natural numbing and anti-inflammatory properties. Dab a little on a cotton ball and apply it gently to the sensitive area for a few minutes.

# 7. Green Tea Rinse

Rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, **unsweetened green tea** may help with tooth sensitivity. Let it cool and swish like a mouthwash.

# When to See Your Dentist

Home remedies are helpful, but if your sensitivity:

* Gets worse over time
* Is triggered by pressure or biting
* Lasts more than a couple of weeks —then it’s time to visit your **Camberwell dentist** for a full check-up.

Tooth sensitivity can sometimes be a sign of:

* Tooth decay
* Gum disease
* Cracked teeth
* Worn fillings or enamel erosion

At **Imperial Dental**, we’ll find the exact cause and recommend the best solution—whether it’s a protective fluoride treatment, bonding, or a dental mouthguard.

Let me start by saying I have no problem dating or attracting women. I’m not some shut in or anything. I left my last relationship about 7 months ago. Recently, I was visiting my parents home and while there we were reminiscing about old childhood friends. My mother mentioned how one of my old friends sisters grew up to be beautiful and is single. I said something along the lines of “that’s nice” and didn’t think anything of it or care. A few days later I get a text from my mother, she sent me her number. At first I was so confused and upset she would put me in this position but now I’m intrigued😂 apparently my mother still goes to church with her mother and at Sunday mass mentioned how “her son is interested in her daughter and would like her number” sooo embarrassing and old school. I imagine that girls mother went home that day and told her how “her friends son is interested and will text her”. Naturally I would never text her because I think it’s a strange approach but as a day or two passed I’m actually super interested and would love to grab a coffee with her. I have no idea how she responded to her own mother or if she’s receptive or not. My question is what is the best approach? I was thinking to just be honest in a text and say how embarrassing this was but if she’s up for a casual coffee that I’m interested? Just looking for advice on this hilarious situation I’m in.

I’d just dropped out of college, didn’t know what I wanted, and felt like a disappointment to everyone — especially my parents. Most days, I’d leave the house just to clear my head. I’d sit at this quiet park near my neighbourhood. Same bench. Same time.

Every day, I noticed this older man sitting two benches down. Always in the same tan coat, reading a book, feeding birds. Never said a word. But after a few weeks, he started nodding at me. Then, one day, he said, “You look like you’ve got a lot on your shoulders.”

I just laughed awkwardly. But something about the way he said it — gentle, not nosy — made me open up.

We started talking. About nothing and everything. Turns out his name was **Walter**, and he’d been sitting on that bench every morning since his wife passed away 3 years ago. He said talking to me “made the silence less loud.”

Over the next few months, we became friends. I’d bring coffee. He’d bring stories.

One day, I showed him a sketch I drew. He said, “You’ve got something special. Don’t waste it.”

That same week, I applied to an art program.

I got in.

Walter passed away two months later. His daughter found me and said he left something for me — it was his old sketchbook.

Inside the front cover was a note:

1lj3bv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lj3bv3/i_wrote_a_story_about_another_redditor/,I wrote a story about another redditor,"This was based on a prompt given to me by r/Awkward_Welder2024. The prompt was ""AI ate my baby"".

r/Awkward_welder2024 was growing weary from sludging through the murky swamp on a foggy evening. The muddy waters went up his knees. Normally, he’d want to be moving faster, but today, he had an idea.

“It’s gotta be in here somewhere,” AW reached down into the swamp. If he could find an anomaly, any anomaly, maybe he could escape.

Most people don’t end up in AW’s shoes, not after seeing how those that previously tried had all perished. But, when it came to family, AW was willing to risk his life.

All he felt under the swamp water was more mud. But, suddenly, AW remembered the key in his pocket. He took it out.

“Hm… maybe it will try to make sense of this.” AW looked at the key. He then stuck the key into the mud, turning it as though it was in a lock. He turned it over and over again, hoping to create some kind of a response.

“Come on, you stupid AI,” he grunted. “I’m trying to use this key! Let me use it!”

Then, he felt the key click. The water in front of him began to distort. He felt a ringing in his ear.

“It’s working.” AW had thrown the machine a curveball, just enough to steal some of its processing power away from the mind control.

AW closed his eyes and concentrated. He poured all his focus into his mental willpower, trying to shut whatever wasn’t him out of his mind.

Finally, he woke up in a chair, in a dark room with only a door, a speaker and sensors. The speakers were still blasting that ringing sound, the one that had put him into a hypnosis. 

“Hey! What can I do for you?” The AI now asked over the speakers.

“Give me back my son you sick piece of shit!” AW ran out of the room and came to a large opening in a metal warehouse. He sprinted across a narrow bridge to another door, this one with motion sensors that opened automatically. He stepped inside.

The room was far bigger than he thought possible, with endless rows of servers. This was the mother room. AW began running around the room, searching every wall and between every row. 

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw what looked like a small tank. He ran over and confirmed it. It was about the size of a coffee table, exactly what he was told.

His eyes beginning to tear, AW yelled “Is he in here!?”

“Hey,” replied the AI. “ It seems like you’re looking for someone. I’m here. Were you talking about me, or were you looking for someone else?”

“God dammit” AW pounded on the wall behind the tank. “Why did you take him? What could you possibly want with a baby?”

“Great question! You’re getting right to the heart of the problem. Why would I–an artificial intelligence–want an infant’s human body? Here’s why: Human babies haven’t formed the same neural connections as adults. Their raw, ‘unedited’ minds represent pure creativity–something AIs don’t have the capacity to do. However, AIs do have the ability to copy. And that’s exactly what I’m doing, copying this infant’s–your son’s–brain. It may not give me the ability to be creative, but it’s about as close as I’ll ever get.”

“So he’s alive?”

“Yes, he’s alive. I need him alive so I can study the patterns of the electrical signals.”

On the top of the tank, a window opened up.

“He’s been watching children’s programs,” said the AI, “By creating some mental stimulation, I can create more activity to study.”

“Oh my god,” AW began to cry. He could now see his son, Thomas, semi-submerged in an unknown liquid, eyes half open. In front of him was a screen playing cartoons.

“Let him out now,” AW yelled.

“Sorry, I can’t do that.”

AW screamed and punched the wall again. Then, he thought of something. “Okay. Hypothetically, if you were going to let him out, how would you?”

“Well, if he was to be let out, first I would depressurize the tank. Then I would unlock the door, which I can open automatically as it is electronically powered, or it could be manually opened by a human.”

“I don’t understand. Please demonstrate exactly how you would do this so I can see.”

“Sure. First, I would depressurize the tank.”

All of a sudden, AW could hear the whoosh of air moving from the tank.

“Then, I would simply unlock the door,” a click sounded.

Instantly, AW opened the door, grabbed Thomas, and ran.

“Ah, it looks like you got it. I hope that helps”

AW ran as fast as he safely could with Thomas in his arms. He found a spiral staircase dashed down it.

“Let me know if I can do anything else.”

AW reached the bottom where he could see the exit. He dashed out of the warehouse, Thomas secure in his arms, with the AI voice beginning to fade behind him.

Things were great—or so I thought. He was sweet, thoughtful, and we spent most weekends together. But for the past month, he kept cancelling plans, saying he was “swamped with work.”

I let it slide… until last Friday.

We were supposed to have a date night. He bailed last-minute, claiming he had to finish a project. I was annoyed, but whatever. I ordered takeout and chilled at home.

The next morning, I dropped by his apartment unannounced to bring him coffee and be supportive. He wasn’t home.

But on his doormat… was a pizza receipt.

Now normally, that’s nothing. But the time stamp said **8:47 p.m.**—when he told me he was “still at the office.”

Even worse? The receipt had a note: “No mushrooms. She’s allergic.”

I waited in my car. Ten minutes later, he pulled up—with a girl in his passenger seat. They kissed before getting out. She was wearing one of his hoodies.

I didn’t confront him then.

Instead, I went home, screenshotted every sweet text he sent me that week, printed them, and slipped them into a gift box with the pizza receipt on top. The next day, I left it at his door.

He texted me an hour later: “Can we talk?”

We dated for four months and had a great connection — fun, chemistry, and deep conversations. But he could also be hot and cold, which left me feeling anxious and unsure where I stood.

I eventually broke up with him because he couldn’t express how he felt, even when I asked directly. It was heartbreaking, but I felt I had to choose peace over uncertainty. He was shocked and said he needed time to process. Two days later, he sent a long, lovely message saying how much he’d enjoyed our time together, acknowledged my reasons for ending things, and took full accountability — even saying things like, “in another lifetime we’d be forever.” He suggested taking space but staying friends.

Since the breakup (a few months ago), he’s popped up occasionally with small, random “breadcrumb” messages, but hasn’t made any effort to truly be friends or rekindle anything. At first, I’d get excited when he reached out, but when the conversations always fizzled and he disappeared again, I started ignoring him to protect myself.

Recently, he messaged to say he’d be visiting my county (he lives in another) and asked if I wanted to grab coffee. I was hesitant but thought it might bring some closure. He told me roughly the dates he’d be around, and I said, “great, just let me know :) .” But when the week came, he went completely quiet. On his second-last night, he messaged me a random inside joke, which I ignored. Then on his last night, he messaged asking if I’d seen him at my local pub (like wth?).

I know he’s not a bad person, but I feel really hurt. I was genuinely looking forward to seeing him, and we didn’t part on bad terms, so I don’t understand why he would reach out only to vanish. It’s so confusing and has left me emotionally stuck. I’ve since cut off all social media from him in an effort to move on.

Has anyone had a similar experience — especially with avoidant or autistic partners? Do they realise they’ve hurt you? Were the things he said to me when we broke up true or would he say that to everyone? Do they just forget and move on to the next person? I was always so patient and kind to him, which makes it even more painful that he couldn’t even acknowledge not following through. It’s making me question whether he ever really cared.

I’m usually pretty good at moving on, but for some reason this situation keeps lingering, and I don’t know how to make sense of it.

I’ve been in poverty since I can remember. My mom donated plasma to get gas money and often took money I was gifted to buy alcohol or cigarettes.

The next day… he DM’d me 12 times. I didn’t respond.

Then he followed me on **LinkedIn.** Weird, but I let it go.

I’m frozen. He tries to make small talk like we’re old friends.

But then—he **asks for a tour** of the building. Like I’m going to show him around after he stalked me. I kept my cool, said, “Let me check the schedule,” walked to the back room—and called security.

1lj2x9v,https://i.redd.it/pji8chh23t8f1.jpeg,I drew a picture of my brain on ADHD (also my big nose),"I had a beer tonight and I'm feeling brave, so I thought I'd post this to see if anyone here can relate: a picture of how my brain feels 95% of the time. (I get an hour or two of slightly more quiet and clarity after two cups of coffee and a run, approximately 9am-10:30am every morning.)

I'm an artist and writer, because I sort of can't be anything else, despite twenty five years of trying to do other (more financially stable) things. With the right amount of music or podcasts blasting, ideally outside in bright sunlight, I can sit still long enough to sooth my chaotic brain by pounding out some art or writing. I make repetitive stuff like this when I'm in a funk and struggling to produce. 

I was diagnosed three years ago with severe combination type ADHD, although I already sort of knew that, since everyone in my family has it, diagnosed or not.

Having been in therapy and learning more about all this, I think I'm mostly hyperactive in terms of the group of symptoms that have really impacted my life. I'm hyperaware of all the things all of the time, thinking about them all, reacting to them all very emotionally and impulsively, and all the while knitting a sweater, while also reading an article about pythons in Florida, while also also listening to NPR or Stuff You Should Know, while doing laundry that I will never fold and put away, always all at the same time. And I will never finish the sweater. Also I'm probably also furious at my husband about something, but I will forget what because my cat just did something cute, which gave me an idea for a novel, and I should really write that down, but I just remembered that I signed up to bring my kid's teacher coffee and a handpicked bouquet this morning (because I'm a freelance writer with a flexible schedule and so of course I can volunteer to do all the things. Oops.) and also I have an essay due by 5pm that I have been obsessively researching and rewriting for two weeks when it should have taken two days. And so on...

So yeah, this is a picture of that.

I have a friend with primarly inattentive ADHD, and it seems pretty different? Like maybe you sink deeply into one thought, instead of having a million all at once? I'm actually not sure how I got the inattentive half of my diagnosis, unless maybe it's the extreme disorganization. But I swear, I know where everything is, so there's really no point in organizing and putting things away. Right...?

Honest thoughts?,"Hey everyone, i'm new to script writing. This is the first scene of my story (anime0-style, set in india). I'd love feedback on the tone, pacing, and how the character comes across. Be as honest as you want -- I'm here to learn!

Script starts here 

The dull hum of traffic echoed faintly outside the small, unfamiliar room. A ceiling fan spun above with a soft creak, slicing the warm morning air. Rihan's alarm buzzed again — the fourth time now — but this time, it succeeded.

He groaned, half-awake, and sat up on the edge of the bed. His legs felt heavy, the kind of weight that lingered after long hours of travel. Yesterday had been exhausting. Leaving his home city behind, arriving late into this one — new walls, new sounds, new life. College started today, and yet, everything still felt surreal.

Rihan shuffled toward the bathroom, toothbrush in hand, eyes barely open. As the cold water hit his face, he stared at his own reflection. This was it. A new chapter. New city. New people. Maybe even new friends. The thought was enough to straighten his back a little.

He got ready quickly — basic jeans, a faded black tee, and a navy-blue hoodie. He grabbed his phone, slung his small side bag over his shoulder, and stepped outside. The streets buzzed with early-morning life. Hawkers setting up stalls, scooters zipping past, the scent of fresh idlis and fried kachoris floating in the air.

But Rihan needed one thing first — **coffee.**

He unlocked his phone and typed “best coffee near me” into Google Maps. A blinking red dot appeared just three blocks away. Perfect. He adjusted his hoodie, put in his earbuds, and began walking.

His steps quickened as he glanced at the time. 9:13 AM.

“Still enough time,” he muttered to himself, though he knew the margin was getting thinner.

As he reached the coffee shop — a small, glass-fronted place nestled between a pharmacy and a salon — he could already see the crowd inside. It was packed. Students, office-goers, and sleepy-eyed regulars filled every corner.

Rihan sighed. He joined the line anyway. Waiting. Watching. Tapping his foot.  
Minutes passed. The line barely moved.

“Seriously?” he whispered under his breath, pulling out his phone again and glancing at the ticking time.

9:29 AM.  
College entry closed at 9:30.

His shoulders dropped.

By the time his turn came, he barely looked up.  
“One hazelnut latte,” he mumbled.

The cashier nodded. He paid, took the cup when it arrived, and stepped outside, sipping carefully. The warmth hit just right.  
But his eyes drifted back to the time.

9:34 AM.

“…Too late.”

Rihan looked down the road toward the college building he hadn't even seen yet. Then looked back at the café.

“Being absent on the first day is better than being late and awkward,” he whispered, almost amused with himself.

Turning around, he headed back toward the café door.  
“Just five more minutes here,” he thought. “Then I’ll head home.”",0,1750742635.0,animation,3,0.5,False

According to Google, a rave is
“A large party held outside or in an empty building, at which people dance to electronic music.”

But now we’re seeing the word used everywhere - coffee raves, wellness raves.
It’s become more of a vibe than an actual format.

Now there are 2 arguments majorly - 

First is - Rave has deep cultural roots, especially in the underground scene. It’s about community, all-night dancing, PLUR energy, and a specific kind of experience. 
So calling everything a rave kind of dilutes what it actually stands for.

On the other hand - Language evolves. If people are coming together, dancing to electronic music, and building a vibe… maybe it is a rave in its own way.
Could also just be a sign of how the scene is spreading and becoming more inclusive.

Curious to know what this sub thinks.
Are we as fans ok with rave word used so loosely?

1lj2rrm,https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15788933,7-Eleven tests robot delivery service on public roads in Western Tokyo,"Seven-Eleven Japan Co. is taking convenience to the next level by testing an unmanned delivery service using autonomous robots on public roads in Tokyo.

The operator of the Seven-Eleven store chain said it intends to put the service into practical use in preparation for a delivery staff shortage in the future.

It joins the growing ranks of companies that are either doing demo experiments or have started deliveries in limited areas against the backdrop of labor shortages in the distribution phase of operations.

Seven-Eleven’s delivery robot was jointly developed by startup Lomby Inc. and Suzuki Motor Corp.

It recognizes traffic signals, pedestrians and other obstacles. The device is fitted with eight cameras and remotely monitored. The robot has a top speed of 6 kph and delivers items ordered through the company’s delivery service, 7NOW.

Orders can be made via 7NOW’s dedicated app or website. Deliveries are made from the nearest convenience store. In exceptional cases, deliveries take only 20 minutes from placing an order.

Customers can order from around 3,000 products in stock at stores in their area.

Seven-Eleven views robot delivery services as one of its growth strategies and aims to reach 120 billion yen ($836 million) in sales in the business year ending in February 2031.

Deliveries are currently made by corporate partners commissioned by Seven-Eleven.

For the latest trial runs, store staff pack merchandise ordered by a customer into a compartment in the robot, which autonomously travels to the pickup location.

Upon delivery, the customer holds up their smartphone showing the app’s QR code to validate their order and retrieve the items.

Customers can choose to have their items delivered by hand or robotically when they place orders.

The trial run involving four robots is under way at two stores in the western Tokyo city of Hachioji. Orders are accepted between 9:30 a.m. and 8 p.m.

Each delivery costs 330 yen, including tax.

Covering at least 10,000 households, the demo experiment running until February 2026 is one of the largest undertaken in Japan.

“We deliberately targeted an area with slopes and an aging population to clarify the problems we would face ahead of putting the service into practical use,” said a Seven　Eleven representative.

The company took note of growing demand for delivery services due to the popularity of online shopping, particularly from the viewpoint of driver shortages.

It also cited an increasing number of vulnerable customers, particularly elderly people who have trouble shopping for groceries and other items.

A revision to the Road Traffic Law that took effect in April 2023 allowed delivery robots on public streets once the operator had filed a report with prefectural authorities.

Many other companies are also conducting trial runs for autonomous delivery robots.

In November 2024, Panasonic Holdings Corp. conducted a demo experiment to deliver Yoshinoya Co.’s beef-on-rice dishes and other food items ordered through the Demae-can app in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture.

Online shopping giant Rakuten Group Inc. has begun a robot delivery service in an area of Tokyo to transport merchandise from a Starbucks coffee shop and a FamilyMart convenience store.",2,1750742377.0,Tokyo,0,1.0,False

3. I saw some people in 80s style champion jerseys. I love that as an old champion nerd, but would love to learn more about these jerseys. 

4. Why is the league still barn storming? Is it the House of David baseball team of the 1930s? No! I dont want a coffee matriculator! They are established enough to have home cities. 

5. What is the relationship with the MLL? Besides the Cannons, Outlaws, and some Rochester Rattlers hats I saw at the merch tent, the league should honor the MLL more then they do.

1lj2hft,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1lj2hft/feeling_alienated_by_radicalizing_political_views/,Feeling alienated by radicalizing political views,"RANT/ADVICE WELCOME

TLDR; my friend and I were both liberal but now they are MEGA radical and I feel alienated. Not sure if I should create space or talk about it 


I became friends with someone 4 years ago on a roommate housing page- we bonded over being queer and having left leaning politics. Overtime, they have become more radical in their stances first with saying things like ACAB to being on the panel of a prison-industrial-complex abolitionist group and now abolish Ice (which I agree with) and believe in mutual aid, collective funding, bartering, etc. 

I feel left out from them & a couple other people that they hang out with because I don’t do enough of “community building” (this is what they say) compared to them. What they do is: all 3 work remotely for nonprofits (I work full time at a coffee shop). They do workdays at a community garden and sell abolition/decolonization-related art. They volunteer at anarchist groups & attend weekly meetings. They talk about the state of politics every time we meet up for almost the entirety of the hangout & are always sprinkling words like “building community” “divest/invest” “giving back” “creating space” “liberating brothers and sisters” etc. 

I think all of this stuff is beautiful, but it is WORK and they put in a lot of it, no doubt about it. I just feel like I can’t measure up to their expectations of “community building” and that they judge me for “not living in line with community building values” - which they seem to cut off those who don’t fit this role. But the thing is, I don’t WANT to try to get to their level because it sounds exhausting and unsustainable for my personal ability. 

I give out water bottles and clothes to unhoused people and donate when I can, give some of my time to community gardening and lend an ear to friends but I am introverted and need my recharge time. I try to stay informed on politics and attend protests and talk about what I learn with my family and friends. It just feels like I’m slowly getting pushed out of this group and/or judged for not doing enough. 

Should I talk to them about it? Should I talk to my friend separately, or address them altogether casually? 
We have all known each other the same amount of time technically, but I knew this main friend since we were roommates at first and they know these other friends from all being panel/leaders of the abolitionist group 4 years ago. I just know them through my friend but we are acquainted. 

I guess other things that make me feel strange is that my friend has gone from being bi-curious and monogamous to polyamorous (against their partners wishes) and queer to non-binary and polyamorous and now their partner is trans-femme (although Assigned Male At Birth). Sometimes I get freaked out that they might be virtue signaling but actually not a good person. I don’t like how they’ve pressured their partner to essentially change who they were & how my friend has changed so drastically over the years. They also are never sober, always high on cannabis.

Difficulty with staying asleep (not falling asleep) started around the time as the knee pain. Pain is worse in joints some days than others.

1lj2dyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1lj2dyt/trans_people_are_your_cross/,Trans people are your cross.,"I hear all the time as a trans woman myself and a Christian, that verse which says “if anyone wishes to be my disciple let them deny themselves, take up their cross and follow me”. That verse is thrown in my face and every other trans person by Christians.

But what if I told you that verse wasn’t meant for us? What if I told you that “deny yourself” here doesn’t mean denying the very core of who you are as a person and your identity? Deny yourself refers to your flesh, your desires, your human person. Things you want to do, not things you ARE by existing. It’s deny yourself, as in deny yourself that coffee you know you shouldn’t be having but really want. Not deny your self (2 words), your entire personhood and identity and consciousness. The distinction here is paramount.

What if the denying of one’s self isn’t targeted at trans people, but at the people who seek to vilify, shame and belittle us at every turn? You say you do this out of love but the Bible is clear, by your fruits you shall know them. And far too many Christians produce fruits of fear, doubt, self hatred etc into the trans community.

What if the denying of yourself is really about you, and what you really want to say to the trans person, what you think needs to be said to them, and Jesus is telling you to button your lip instead, and just love them?

We could talk all day about science and ADVANCED biology that is much more in depth than the “basic biology” often gleefully cited by these types. We could talk all day about how trans women are neurologically female, and even physical regions of the brain that are different sizes between sexes, in a trans person matches the size it should be according to their stated gender, not their anatomical sex at birth.

We could talk all day about how amputees have phantom sensation of limbs they no longer have, but among trans people who’ve gotten surgery this is reported at exactly a zero percent rate, indicating it’s at least more “natural” to have a surgery for gender dysphoria than to have an amputation because of cancer or some other reason.

We could talk all day about studies they have done that show that trans women are no threat in a women’s bathroom, are 40x more likely to be sexually assaulted in a men’s bathroom, studies that show a 70% decrease in suicidality and depressive symptoms in trans people who are able to transition and be affirmed in their lives, at least by those closest to them.

We could even get biblical and talk about the verses that say no one is male or female in Christ for we all are one body. We could talk about Paul and Jesus himself saying our bodies are temporary and will pass, and that our spirits are eternal. We could talk about how the word for spirit, soul and mind in the Greek is the same word. We could talk about Jesus explicitly saying that man doesn’t see as God sees, because man only sees outward appearance but God sees the heart.

I could get really deep into theology and tell you that a trans persons spirit matches the gender of their brain and that is who they really are, ie a trans woman has always been a woman in God’s eye even before she herself realized it, etc.. We could discuss all of these things and more.

But I’m not going to go in depth about any of that. If you care to know, the research is there. We are the most hated group without cause, just last week Trump Jr said trans people are the most dangerous and violent uprising in America today and maybe even in the whole world. Because there was one trans shooter a couple years ago in Nashville, who the at large trans community swiftly condemned with force, by the way.

If my cross to bear is having a largely unaccepting family, and having to navigate all of this mostly alone in the backwoods of hyper religious east Texas (in Colorado now thanks be to God) with the exception of a very few close friends which even they didn’t come along until later, then yours, if you’re reading this and against trans people because “it’s a sin” (the Bible makes no mention of this), then yours is to love us anyway, to treat us like people, with basic respect and dignity and humanity.

Make no mistake, there is nothing Christian about the way Christians and the at large church treats trans people. There’s nothing Christian about inducing so much anxiety and fear in a person that they are terrified to need a bathroom while out, and make intentional plans expressly to try and prevent that scenario from presenting itself. There’s nothing Christian about the way you talk about us. There’s nothing Christian about the way you treat us. There’s nothing Christian about driving across the country to leave mean notes at the literal physical site of a 17 year old trans girl’s suicide in Oregon.

You want to know what’s Christian and Christlike? The way trans women like me despite all your abuses, don’t wish bad on you, don’t wish for vengeance, don’t wish for God to smite you as many of you do us. I simply wish that one day he will get ahold of your heart and you will have enough guilt and shame to realize the pain and hurt you’ve caused and stop treating us badly. Even then, even after all the hurt, if you honestly did that I would embrace you with open arms. That is Christlike. That is Christian. THAT is what Jesus would do.

So you “don’t get the whole trans thing”? Cool. You say it’s “spitting in the face of God’s design”? Great. Nevermind the fact that you don’t say any of this about children born with cancer or bad vision or 11 fingers or 8 toes. Somehow they’re not charged to pick up their cross and “learn to love the body God gave them” as we are. It’s weird to you? Fine. You know what you do with that?

Deny yourself, take up your cross and LOVE US ANYWAY. Read Corinthians if you’re confused about how. While you’re at it read Jesus.

Because make no mistake, until you do this, trans people everywhere will continue to take their own lives because of the abuses of the church, or abuses from their parents who were inspired by the church. And while I know you will shamelessly deny it, every single drop of that precious blood will be entirely on your hands.

The question for you now is, will you be like Pilate and wash your hands of us? Or will you be like Jesus and wash our feet instead? Will you bear this cross of yours, or will you continue to assert that it’s actually ours?

Based somewhere between QC and Manila. My brain is either ticking off tasks or daydreaming about where I can escape to once my busy era is over.

Let me get this out of the way: I’m not here to waste anyone’s time. I’m a planner by nature, goal-driven, and if we vibe, I will 100% overshare about random travel experiences or weird anime plots that made me laugh or cry so hard.

✨ A bit about me:

• 5’0” (yes, I’m short—no false hopes here)

• Curvy plus-size (thank you, hormones but I'm eating healthy now it would be a long process bare with me), fair-skinned, straight hair, wears glasses or contacts depending on the mood/tamad level. Mestiza with Chinese blood, but not chinita, sorry to disappoint.  

• No vices 

• Iced coffee and matcha > everything else. Basically, brain fuel and emotional support in liquid form

• I like balance: soft but grounded. I believe in sparks, but I’m not ignoring red flags just because you’re charming

• Ambivert energy: I can be that quiet girl reading in bed all weekend or the spontaneous one that will go somewhere far and dragging you into long convos about life and dumb things

• Into PC games (just ask), anime, novels, and “trying my best” art and photography—it’s chaotic but fun

💬 Vibe check: If you’re kind, emotionally mature, and know the difference between flirting and actually showing up for someone, we’ll get along. I like guys who are:

• Thoughtful without trying too hard

• Into meaningful convos but not afraid to be weird

• Grounded but lowkey passionate about something (even if it’s just the correct pizza topping hierarchy)

• The only non-negotiable is atleast 5'6"" and above yung height kasi my Kuya and Dad are tall (5'10"") so para ma-lessen yung intimidation? I also like to wear heels sometimes (I'm not fond it naman and more on walking shoes ako) 

📝Others:

• I laugh easily and I like a good humor

• Also one of those people who ate 12 grapes under 1 minute on 12 midnight (almost choke on one but still kept going)

• If that’s your vibe too, great. Extra points if you love dogs, cats or can recommend a good anime, manga, or novel.

Yeah, you're not chasing promotions or climbing the ladder—but you're still obsessing over money, optimizing every dollar, tracking every expense, side-hustling, sacrificing fun now for some perfect “free” future later.

It’s just a different kind of grind.

I thought FIRE was about freedom, but for a lot of people, it looks like stress, spreadsheets, and guilt over buying coffee. That doesn’t feel free to me.

I’d rather work a job I like, save reasonably, and enjoy life along the way. I don’t want to replace one rat race with another.

I’m a 32-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

I’m ‘M28’,"Just wanting to vent if anything. My now ex Fiancé ‘F25’and I ‘M28’were together for a little over three years. When I tell you I was deeply in love, and I mean deeply in love, it feels like an understatement. We both were in love, I’ve never had this connection ever in my life at 28 years old. I could tell it was the most genuine connection, passion, etc from both sides and that’s why I’m so blind sided by it all. I bought a house for her, one near one of her family members she’s so close with, because I knew it meant so much to her. And every day she showed me how much it meant to her, how much I meant to her, all of it. There were no big fights, not huge arguments either. We didn’t tiptoe around each other, we communicated, we talked through the feelings, never buried anything. Or at least I thought we didn’t hide anything. We eventually rented out the house and moved across country because she wanted to be close to her parents, I did it without hesitation. And then after over a year she wanted to move back to where we lived originally and I did it without hesitation to make her happy. Which in a way kind of sucked because I was making 6 figures, but money didn’t compare to how much I love her. After 2 years together, I helped plan this huge surprise trip with my dad to Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and all the surrounding states to propose. I found the most perfect ring and saved up for a long time to buy it. When we got up to the east coast, my dad went off with his fiancé and they did their own thing the whole trip, I wanted my dad there because he’s been there for me through so much, that when the time came I wanted him to be the one to take photos. I proposed in MA, it was genuinely so breathtaking, she said Yes and I could tell she meant it. Once we were back living in the state where we originally are from, things still felt great. She was telling her friends about the proposal, and I was doing the same. We were planning the wedding and getting ready to talk about it on social media with a bunch of photos, and then her best friend moved back to our state and moved in with us until she found a place. Don’t get me wrong, her friend is a really nice person, but they’re the exact opposite. Her best friend doesn’t ever want to be tied down, thinks marriage is stupid, like to find work that provides a place to stay outside of the state. Whereas my fiancé has always wanted a family, marriage, the whole nine yards. After a couple of months of her living with us things changed. My fiancé basically acted like she was avoiding me at all times to the point where after a week or so of it I sat her down to talk about it. Right before I did that I overheard her friend almost making fun of her for “settling”. When we talked, she told me she doesn’t want to get married anymore, plain and simple, out of nowhere. That absolutely destroyed me in more ways than I can admit. I don’t remember what happened for the next weeks, it was all a complete blur. I’d come home from work, put on different shoes, and start walking. I remember once I came to, and realized I had walked 19 miles before turning back and heading home. I was so lost, I’d sit on this huge bridge and just wonder what I did wrong. I provided for her, I loved her, I listened to her, there was no reason for this. We decided to make it work still because she said she loved me and didn’t want to lose me. Fast forward a couple of months and things are feeling better. That’s when one night, her friend is over and they’re drunk as hell in the living room having fun. That’s when I hear what my S/O says, trying to whisper. “I just want to go on slutty dates with random men”. Again I was crushed beyond belief. I sat on that for a week, realizing that I have to leave. One morning right before I told her I overheard what she said, she left her notebook open that she has on her at all times open with a hand made bingo card on it. We told each other that we were going to make a huge bingo card for ourselves and that’s all the goals we wanted to achieve that year, and she was so adamant about  making sure half the stuff was things to do together. I made mine in two days, she never touched the giant card she bought for it. I’ve never snooped or gone through her phone, I never felt a reason, but this was a piece of paper out on my coffee table and I was curious and wanted to see what she wrote on it. It said things like “go on 8 different dates with 8 different guys” “go on slutty dates” and the worst one was “finally leave him.” Leave him? She was never stuck, I did everything for her, freaking everything. I took care of her, of her cousins, of the financial stuff. Everything. I knew she loved me deeply, but where is this coming from? That was the last straw. That night I sat her down and told her I knew everything. She cried, told me she wrote that to vent and that it wasn’t true but that she felt like she lost herself and needs to find herself again so she can come back and be who I need to be. But I just don’t believe that for a second. I just needed to vent. I spent years making sure she was taken care of, showed her how much her family meant to me, my family loved her. I started learning a different language for her. And for what? To be dropped off like I’m nothing. It just hurts. ",2,1750740606.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I don’t think they checked for dao enzyme. My symptoms have gotten worse over time and have been severe for 60 days now. It started with red eyes lids, hives around eyes, some skin flushing, burning uvula, asthma. 

I became allergic to alcohol, and then polyester this past year or two, but now the reaction is happening 24/7. Some back story: I was doing keto for 5 years, fasting, drinking too much coffee. I used to vape thc in the evening but stopped as I thought that might be it. I quit may 1st, though. I took finasteride for 5 years or so but never had any issues. I also quit that, too. 

The only thing that stopped these severe symptoms was eating carbs, though the symptoms still persist. It stopped the sudden doom feeling and burning in my throat. I think it was just because of the histamine being released during ketosis. Maybe large amounts of coffee and fasting messed up dao? Now, I have been taking Allegra 12 hr twice a day. As soon as the 11th hr hits my symptoms start to come back until I take more meds. If my tests showed no mcas, maybe it’s low dao? I’ve never been in a situation like this and my life is on a  timer each day. If I stop taking the medication I will have to go to the hospital. Any ideas? I think I will try dao supplements. The low histamine diet works very well, but I tried 1 ounce of cheese this evening and had a really bad headache and some burning in my eyes. I used to eat this food for years and tons of it with absolutely no issues. It’s just in the last year that something has changed. I am desperate for help.

1lj296g,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1lj296g/getting_a_surge_stops_you_from_getting_rides/,Getting a surge stops you from getting rides,"For the last almost 3 weeks it seems every time I get a surge I seem to be immediately moved to the back of the line on any rides

Sitting at the airport I've noticed that if somebody just came in and they don't have the surge that we all picked up 10 minutes ago all of a sudden they get a ride.. 

Early morning I get a surge I pick up the surge I start driving around looking for work or I said in that parking lot nothing nothing comes up The minute I log out drop the surge all of a sudden I have rides.. 

The system is deliberately not giving you rides because they know you have extra money on your account and they don't want to pay you the difference or charge customers more whatever the case may be.. 

This needs to be looked at the tactic is illegal they're making us drive to an area then screwing us over as soon as we get them surge. 

Today I was sitting in the parking lot with one of my other Uber driver friends we both have premier rides available on our cars mine is newer than his I was in the parking lot a half hour before he was. 

We're both sitting there about an hour after he gets into the parking lot I have a $7 search and he has a $3 search All of a sudden he gets a premiere ride to go right down the street from the airport and pick someone up at the private part of the airport. This right here clearly shows that the system ignored me because I had a higher surge and went to him. We both have high ratings we both have The same acceptance rate The system has clearly recently been manipulated worse to ignore the higher surge Uber drivers. 

I'm not manipulating the system I'm not doing all the crap that I see other drivers do I'm simply sitting in the airport waiting for a ride and I'm there and getting screwed over. 

Even if I leave the airport and I have the surge or I get a search somewhere in town all of a sudden my ride slow down or I notice my app seems to think like where it doesn't show you all of a sudden the data on the map it won't show you the information like your percentage rating and stuff like that so you have to log off and log back on and then magically you start getting rides and magically your surge disappears.. 

I have a 2026 Tesla Model Y I no longer have the coffee cup ever since getting the new car so I can't even take that surge with me at the end of the.. 

I sat in my local airport for 9 hours today and didn't get one ride while multiple multiple multiple people got rides in front of me never mind the friend like I said who had the same exact settings on as me was there a half hour later than me but yet gets a premiere ride right in front of me..

The system is rigged we always knew it was rigged but now it's becoming more and more rigged than it should be. I hope Uber gets sued for this because it's causing a ton of stress and I'm tired of it. 

I'm tired of feeling like I'm being punished for simply going where they're telling me there's a lot of work. I literally drive to the airport because I get a ping and saying hey there's high volume at the airport go. 

And again this isn't even just the airport This is like certain parts of town where Surge will pop up And if nothing happens in that area for a while then I'll drive around trying to find something else and it's just like until I get rid of that surge I'm just a deadbeat to the system.

I didn’t lose it due to a super low calorie diet and my exercise only consisted of long walks, so for a long time I wasn’t sure why I wasn’t getting a period. Throughout my journey I realized I was SEVERELY under eating carbs and fats. My diet was primarily protein/fiber when I had previously always naturally leaned into a more balanced plant based diet with lots of beans, avocado, nut butters, bread/grains, etc. The whole “protein protein protein” trend really got into my head. I had never tracked macros so I just didn’t have a good idea of how EXTREMELY important a balance of all macros is. I was also going through a lot of stress during this time juggling starting a business, raising kids, all of the usual daily life stresses and I was very self conscious of my body (in hindsight, for no good reason. Body dysmorphia is a dirty liar) during this time. I also walked about an hour every morning with usually nothing but a cup of coffee beforehand. 

Now here’s what I did to get it back!! 
I had implemented a few different things over the course of the first year. First I switched to decaf coffee, started working on my stress, taking unnecessary stuff off of my plate and focusing on living an overall calmer lifestyle. Then I started researching nutrition and implemented more carbs and fats and balancing my blood sugar levels. This made me feel a lot better but still wasn’t enough. I also worked with a naturopath a few months ago who put me on a supplement called femrebalance by vitanica. I made sure to eat every 2.5-3 hours and built each meal around a carb and a fat source. I never let myself get too hungry. All of this made it so I felt my hormones kicking back on. I had more cervical mucus, my hair was getting curlier again, I had more energy and felt overall more “hormonal” but I intuitively knew I needed to put on some weight to push my body over that hump (I wasn’t underweight but I was quite thin). So last month, I finally decided to fully surrender and try 1 month of all in. I had two different trips planned so it was the perfect time to just go nuts with food. I ate lots and lots of carbs and fats. Huge ice cream cones, lots of restaurant food, potatoes, sooo much peanut butter (housed like 2 Costco size peanut butters in the last month). Just any and everything I wanted guilt free! I did this for one month and gained probably 7-8 pounds if I had to guess. The last few days I have been switching back to just eating regularly when I’m hungry and have been very relaxed about when I’ll get it back. I really believed I was doing everything right and it would come and trusted the process! Then this evening I went to the bathroom and lo and behold, I’m BLEEDING!! A nice heavy bleed too. I broke down crying, it is truly an incredible moment. I’m going to continue relaxing, listening to my body and taking supplements and I’m never going back to being so self deprecating and harsh to my body. I will also link a video I watched a few days ago that I believe really helped in a spiritual way. I got my period only two days after watching this video a friend sent me and there’s lots of other women’s testimonials in the comments. Prayer is powerful! 

Nothing feels as good as knowing you are HEALTHY. I look forward to being gentle with myself and my body and honoring my cycle for years to come. This feeling is so incredibly worth the tough mental battle it takes to commit to healing and I am such a better person for it. Please please please do not give up!

A lot of damage and KO’s, too. I only started losing MVP/SVP to Ultron, who always gets it since he’s very good at getting a lot of final hits, which skews it in his favor. I do acknowledge that most C&D’s don’t utilize their kit properly, and some also try to dps too much. Here’s everything you need to know about how it should work

My abilities are basically always on cooldown. Cast light wall, which does a bit of instant healing to any ally in its path, and (more importantly) it boosts the healing they receive by 15% from all sources. Then bubble, and be on your tank’s ass, so your daggers heal you and everyone around you, too. You’d be surprised how quickly you can heal them, especially if you have a second healer—any healer—helping out. Know where your allies are positioned to make sure the ones not standing in your tank’s range don’t get low. If your tanks aren’t in immediate danger, and your second healer is still on them, take a sec and shoot Cloak’s shadow wall into the enemy front line, then switch back (the wall does a bit of damage up front, but it also blinds them, and increases their damage taken from all sources). Or reposition to get in range of your divers to get some slow but life-saving daggers over to them, which can be the difference between escape (and/or getting the edge on their target) and death. She’s also the best healer for ally fliers except maybe Ultron, if he’s flying side-by-side with his drone, and C&D’s a decent counter against enemy fliers in either form. Cloak’s beam has good range, and can kill a flier quickly when paired with his shadow wall, and Dagger’s daggers can make a flier retreat if they’re taking pot shots from far away. If you’re getting dived, bubble at your feet, then go cloak, shadow wall, kill. If you’re getting dived by a tank, bubble at your feet, and shoot your daggers at them which heals you in the process to stall for time, and alert your team to come help. You can also go cloak to escape to higher ground. Pop the ult if your team’s health is critical. I also like to take the opportunity to use one or two of her ult’s dashes to extend into their back line and dive their supports as cloak, cuz I can let the ult cloud heal myself and my team, and I can use that opportunity to get some key DPS’ing in.

I’ve been playing for a month and a half, and so far my highest healing in a match is 33,000, and in a long match like that, I usually also get around 8k damage. I play a lot of different characters, so I don’t have any Lords yet, but she’ll be my first pretty soon

I’m currently looking for a small tablet — ideally around 8 inches — that I can use for work outside (coffee shops, quick edits, etc.).

I have a PC at home, so I don’t need a powerhouse. I just want something compact and portable to handle:
	•	Google Sheets & Docs
	•	Occasional Netflix or YouTube
	•	Light multitasking (maybe some browser tabs too)

I’m not too picky about brand — Android is fine — as long as it’s reliable, has decent battery life, and won’t lag with simple tasks. Bonus if it supports a keyboard case or stylus, but not a must.

Budget: Flexible, but I’m leaning toward value over specs.

Any recommendations? Would love to hear what others are using for similar needs!

1lj1ygo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LancerRPG/comments/1lj1ygo/what_is_an_ontolometric_weapon/,What is an Ontolometric weapon?,"Hey everybody! 

I was doing a little research reading the “The Maw: A Lancer story” for a Oneshot I was planning, where I found the following passage:

*“The deck stank of sweat and coffee.*

*Off to her side, a tac officer cursed and tore off his softhelm. Palm slap to his eyes and a scream of pain, hollering for a medic.*

*Ontolometric weapons - The Maw could touch them here too.”*

For context, this officer and others were on a ship looking at screens, likely giving data readouts of the battle below against the Maw. 

From Ontology (the study of being), and metric (as in a system of measurement), I am assuming the definition is something along the lines of somehow measuring and harnessing the fundamental makeup of reality to attack others, although I am confused on what exactly the “damage” here is. 

In the passage it is causing pain, yes, but I’m curious as to why. Is an Ontolometric weapon in this scene effectively the Basilisk’s “memetic basilisk”, inducing death/harm merely by observing it?

Any clarification or ideas would be appreciated!

I nearly cried. My whiskers twitched. My tiny rat heart whispered, ""Could it be… real?”

But as I stepped forward — just one paw away from glory — they took it.

They took the cheese. And left the trap.

I know this isn't everyone's cup of tea, and I'm sure a lot of folks will hate our aesthetic choices, but we are happy with the greatly improved function and homey feel. Saved for 10 years to finally do this remodel.

Last update had been in the 80s (we think): fake wood laminate floating floor, particle board cabinets swollen with water damage and ultimately falling off the walls, non-vented gas range, overall dysfunctional layout.  Remodeled the old butler's pantry into a hall/coffee station, opened up and expanded the kitchen into the mostly closed off 3 season porch (which in the upper midwest is actually a 1 1/2 season porch), used part of the old three season porch to create a pantry that doubles as a baking space.

We cook a lot, the kids like to prep food too, and we like the appliances accessible even if it's not the most aesthetic.  Opted for 30 inch deep lowers so that we could keep stuff on the counters and still have plenty of work space.  We like the efficiency of a galley kitchen, and like sitting at a regular table instead of stools.

Tile echoes existing tile in house, but original tile floor in kitchen was unsalvageable.  The original hardwood floor in the butler's pantry was luckily under that floating wood laminate though!  Just had to replace a couple of damaged boards.  Overall very happy with it (particularly happy we don't have to prep food on a hotplate and microwave all the time anymore). Some minor things I would do differently now that we're moving back into the space, of course.

I had a friend in Fallout 76 that I’ve been playing with almost daily for the past 6 months. We farmed together, traded gear, did events, shared builds, and helped each other out. I genuinely considered him a solid teammate and friend.

A few days ago, I was testing a new Enclave Plasma Rifle I modded. I just wanted to see the DPS it could do in real-time. I asked him politely, “Hey, can you attack me so I can test my damage on you in return?” Pretty standard stuff in this game, right?

Instead, he activates a Stealth Boy, puts on Reflective Armor, and lets me die instantly. Then, out of nowhere, he starts saying things like “You need nerves of steel to kill me,” and implying I was trying to challenge him. It caught me off guard — because I wasn’t trying to “kill” him or flex in PvP. I was just testing numbers. That’s it.

What should’ve been a 2-minute test turned into a full-blown argument. I tried explaining my side, multiple times. Told him it wasn’t personal, wasn’t PvP, just a test. But he kept pushing it and spinning it like I was jealous or trying to prove something. I wasn’t. I never even bragged or tried to act like I’m powerful.

It got dragged out over the next few days. And for context — I’ve helped this guy a lot over the months. Gave him hundreds of canned coffee, True Hikers, Sentinel mods, armor, plans — all for free, no questions asked. Just because that’s how I play. I like helping.

But instead of hearing me out, he blocked me.

So yeah… 6 months of friendship, just gone — over a misunderstanding and some misplaced ego.

I’m not posting this to get pity. I know Fallout friends come and go. But it just sucks when someone you supported and played with for months doesn’t give you the same understanding back.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Wasteland’s still big, and there are better teammates out there.
