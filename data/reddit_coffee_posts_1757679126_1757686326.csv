Why 65? Well, I had originally planned for this to be a Top 100, but as I started writing notes on each game I had planned to include, I just didn't have a whole lot of good things to say about the games towards the bottom of the list. Either the game was really just mediocre, or I haven't played it enough. I did go back and play some of the games in that latter category, but at some point I decided I needed to just publish something lest it remain in a state of half-finished purgatory.

I think every game on a ""Top X"" list should be something I can recommend and explain why. 65 ended up being the number that would satisfy that criteria. It's only two-thirds the size of what I had envisioned, but I can at least say that I recommend every game on the list, even if you only ever play it solo.

With the odd list size having been explained, let's get on to the methodology. I'm considering games entirely on the basis of playing them solitaire. Many of them can be played multiplayer as well, but their virtues (or lack thereof) in that format have no bearing here. There are a few games with mediocre solo modes that I keep around because they're great multiplayer, and vice versa.

A few games don't support solo play in an official capacity, but do have unofficial variants. If I've played it solo, it's eligible for inclusion. I'll give my preferred way of playing the game solo on its listing if it isn't obvious.¬† This is also true of cooperative games that I play multi-handed.

Games deemed sufficiently similar have been combined into a single entry.¬† I want a list of 65 distinct games, and (as an example) having five different Pandemic variants would yield a list that really only had 61 games.¬† However, I'll write at least a little about each game in a combined entry.¬† Same goes for any expansions.¬† (Incidentally, this is also one of my main gripes with the BGG Top 100)

Don't read too much into a game's exact position, especially outside the top 20 or so.¬† If I were to do it all over again, it wouldn't surprise me to see some games shift by as many as 10 places.¬† This isn't a scientific ranking based on the collected opinions of hundreds of gamers, where even a small shift could be significant.¬† It's one person's opinion, and I did it because it's a fun (if at times excruciating) exercise.¬† You could lump all the games with the same tens digit together without losing much signal, if I'm being honest.

I (20F) live in a 2-bedroom apartment that I pay for MYSELF. A few months ago, my sister (23F) asked if she could stay with me after experiencing a bad breakup. She didn‚Äôt have a steady job and said she just needed a place until she got back on her feet. I agreed because... obviously.. that's my sister, and I thought it would only be for a short while and it would be nice to spend time with her more.

At first, it was fine, but over time she stopped helping out completely. She ate my groceries, left dirty dishes piled in the sink for days, never cleaned her messes (I get easily overstimulated and NEED my place clean) and never contributed to rent or bills despite saying she would next paycheck.. smh.  She also constantly borrowed my clothes without asking and a couple of them came back stained with makeup and stretched out.... seriously bro?

I tried to set some boundaries, but she brushed them off. She started inviting friends over late at night (even during the week when I had class at 8am the next morning, MIND YOU IM TAKING 5 CLASSES IN ONE DAY ALL 8 AM). One time, one of her friends ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù broke my coffee table and they all acted like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

The absolute last straw was when I came home after a long shift and found out she had given a guy she was seeing my spare key so he could wait inside for her. I walked in to a complete stranger sitting on my couch, eating my food, and playing on my PlayStation. I told her that was a huge violation of my trust and that I didn‚Äôt feel safe in my own home anymore.

We argued, and in the heat of the moment I told her to pack her stuff and leave right at that moment. She cried and yelled at me saying  I was abandoning her when she had nowhere else to go, I told her to go live with that random guy and that she wasn't my problem anymore. Now my parents are blowing up my phone saying I should‚Äôve been more patient, given her a deadline, or at least let her stay until she saved up for her own place. They keep repeating ‚Äúfamily doesn‚Äôt kick family out.‚Äù

I know I could‚Äôve handled it better, and part of me feels guilty because she really doesn‚Äôt have many options and that IS my blood. But I also feel like I was being walked all over and disrespected in my own home.

My parents both drank heavily. My dad died suddenly of a heart attack the day after one of his daily evenings of heavy drinking. My mom is alive and still drinks heavily each day.

I do not think my parents ever believed they had any sort of drinking problem, so my Adult children of alcoholics or my Al anon experience has been kind of secret. I know my mom already feels judged and uncomfortable because I don't drink any alcohol, with her or anyone else, while she still drinks heavily every day.

I am an only child, but my extended family and my parents friends still drink.

I was at a dinner earlier this week with my mom's friends. My mom herself was out of town. Her friends are all retired and have pensions and are financially comfortable in retirement, and they all drink heavily, probably not all that differently from when they were teens, or any other decade after that. Except they are older adults in their 70s. 

One of my mom's friends has been dealing with neurological symptoms after having a concussion a couple years ago. She explained to me that every afternoon and evening she has severe brain fog, and she has trouble concentrating, or following complex conversations. She still kept up the drinking on pace with all the other people at the dinner. By the time there was dessert, this one friend was quite intoxicated, but one of my mom's friends just thought that it was ""funny"" and took photos of her as she slumped over exhausted, sitting at the table with everyone. It felt cruel to me, and like they were a bunch of mean teenagers in the bodies of 70-year-olds with little care for people's health or well being.

My mom's friends have previously asked my boyfriend and I (he doesn't drink, or will only do so occasionally and not to excess) if we are Mormon. We are not, but I think because drinking is such a huge part of their social lives, they cannot understand why we don't drink. I don't like when I am criticized for not drinking as though I must be someone who is a...religious zealot or someone who cannot have ""fun"" because I don't drink alcohol.

I am an only child, and I don't know if I should draw a line in the sand and, say, refuse to go to any more dinner parties with friends of my family, or if I should only meet them for coffee, or only meet them for breakfast or brunch, when hopefully they would not be intoxicated. 

I think they don't see anything wrong with their behaviour and I sometimes feel odd being around them when they're intoxicated, and get angry or seem not to care about their health as older adults.

Do you visit with other people who drink? Have you stopped going to dinner parties with other people who drink, or who drink with your family member who drinks heavily?

Do you think it‚Äôd be easy to find someone to take this job, or should I save the money I would‚Äôve spent on a membership and get drop-in sitters? My concern is that we‚Äôd invest in a membership and then not be able to find anyone who is a good fit.

Pros
- Our kittens are absolutely adorable and sleep like 80% of the day 
- They‚Äôre good with strangers (one is a bit shy, the other is pretty social)
- We have a large 1-bedroom in the Upper East Side (over 800 sq ft)
- It‚Äôs a cute neighborhood with countless coffee shops and restaurants in walking distance
- 20 minute walk from Central Park
- Easy access to the rest of the city through transit
- Doorman and elevator building
- 65‚Äù TV with a sound bar and subwoofer in living room (plus a 55‚Äù in the bedroom).
- Bouldering gym less than 10 min walk away
- Washers/dryers available in building (basement)
- Desk in bedroom for WFH

Cons
- The cats are less than 1 year old, so the sitter would need to be pretty tidy and make sure unsafe foods, medications, or choking hazards are never left unattended (very important)
- They get the zoomies and chase each other in circles twice a day (roughly 9am and 9pm). But it‚Äôs very fun to watch, so maybe it‚Äôs a pro! 
- Pretty strict about no shoes and would ask the house sitter to do the same
- We‚Äôre on the 9th floor but live near some hospitals and can hear ambulances when they go by. But we have a white noise machine in the bedroom, and that makes a huge difference overnight. 
- No dishwasher 
- They can be very sneaky and will try to go places they‚Äôre not allowed (the closets, the bedroom)!!

 ‚ÄúI need a plumber who can come today, fix a water heater, and won‚Äôt charge a callout fee.‚Äù

3. Then finally even Ads are shifting too, trust signals are becoming a bigger deal. As there are reports Ads are going to now appear under Google AI search too.

Hemp beverage industry trade association The Hemp Beverage Alliance (HBA) is establishing a coalition to create and support a sensible regulatory framework for hemp beverages in the Keystone State.

Hemp beverages include seltzers, sodas, mocktails, coffees, teas and other alcohol-free drinks that contain an infusion of hemp-derived cannabinoids, according to HBA. Since hemp was legalized in the 2018 Farm Bill, states like Minnesota, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and others have developed regulatory frameworks to create a safe and thriving industry.

**‚ÄúHemp beverages are the fastest growing category in adult beverages, but we need a regulatory framework to protect consumers, keep products away from children and allow the category to thrive,‚Äù** said Christopher Lackner, president, HBA, in a news release. **‚ÄúWe look forward to working with legislators, public health advocates, law enforcement, alcohol distributors and other stakeholders to create a system that works for everyone.‚Äù**

Hemp Beverage Alliance Working with PA HBA has retained Jay Wiederhold of Wanner Associates to lead their legislative efforts in the Commonwealth, according to the release. Mr. Wiederhold served for 20 years as president of the Pennsylvania Beer Alliance (PBA). 

**‚ÄúA sensible regulatory framework will allow a safe, thriving and transparent hemp beverage industry along with permitting the Commonwealth to generate tax revenues and create jobs. This is especially important as we see state budget shortfalls and employment declines in the beer, wine and spirits sectors,‚Äù** said Wiederhold in the release. 

States with a regulatory framework for hemp products enjoy significant tax revenues. In 2024, Minnesota taxed hemp products at 10% and generated $11.6 million in revenue, according to HBA. Tennessee, which taxes hemp products at 6%, generated more than $11 million in revenue in 2024. That number jumped to $17 million for 2025. These numbers are expected to increase as awareness of the category grows.

‚ÄúAs a much larger state than Tennessee or Minnesota, Pennsylvania can expect significantly higher tax revenues from hemp beverages,‚Äù said Wiederhold in the release.",1,1757685532.0,TLRY,0,1.0,False

I recently got the Sage/Breville Bambino on sale to replace my Stilosa. I still need a new portafilter, but I have no idea which one to choose. I would like a bottomless portafilter or one where you can choose between bottomless or with a nice spout (the Normcore one looks very nice but the reviews aren't great). My main concern is that I want one that fits the original baskets that came with the machine, since I use the original single cup (single wall) basket. I drink too much coffee to use 18+ grams for each cup, and I quite like what I can achieve with the single cup basket.

Does anyone have experience with the bottomless portafilters from Normcore, MHW-3bomber (the astra for example), Knodos or Neouza and whether they fit the original baskets without having the basket stick to the group every time you take it off? Bonus points if it inserts more smoothly than the stock portafilter.

1nf3x1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1nf3x1y/my_colonoscopy_experience_i_was_so_anxious/,my colonoscopy experience- I was so anxious!!!,"I‚Äôm a 27F and recently have had some issues that caused me some concern. I went to a GI doctor where he recommended a colonoscopy as a way to just make sure it was nothing serious.

I had that appointment August 12, and was scheduled for a colonoscopy September 11. It was a short wait, which I‚Äôm grateful for. 
The doctor preferred the pill prep, Sutab. It wasn‚Äôt super pricey with my insurance, ($60‚Ä¶worth it for my peace of mind) and I needed to get magnesium citrate liquid to take 2 nights before my procedure. 

At 7:00pm, Sept 9, I took the magnesium citrate. Then the next morning I went to the bathroom twice. I tried to eat a low fiber diet 2 days leading up to it. Then continued with a clear liquid diet. It really wasn‚Äôt too hard. I worked, so I wasn‚Äôt thinking about food too much. I brought Gatorade and icees to eat. Then 5pm, I started the prep which was 12 pills. My doctor recommended I space them out 3 minutes apart to avoid bloating or nausea. By the 6th pill I could hear my stomach rumbling. I finished all 12, and drank the recommended amount of water. I was prepared for lots of pain but there wasn‚Äôt any! No stomach pain at all; just lots of trips to the bathroom. I went to sleep around 9pm and slept until 7:30 the next morning with no problems. When I woke up I took the other half the same way (although I sometimes I only waited 1.30 between each). I was preparing for pain but again! No pain. Everyone says prep is the worst part so I was worried that for me it would be something else. 
Anyway, my appointment was at 1:45 and I was told to be there by 12:45. I got there at 12:30, signed some forms, and was told to wait and someone would call me back. Less than 5 minutes lady a nurse called me, she took me to get changed, and set up. She was very calm and professional. She asked me a couple questions about when I ate last, my allergies etc. then another nurse came by to put my IV in. I told her I really didn‚Äôt like needles and I was nervous. She said they usually put it in the hand but she said the vein in my arm was very noticeable so she put it there instead. Then the anesthesiologist came by, she was a young woman, which made me feel less anxious for some reason. She was very professional and explained that it was a ‚Äútwilight sedation‚Äù and that it would be like I was asleep, and I‚Äôd be breathing on my own. I was most anxious about the sedation part. I always think of the worst possible thing that could happen so I freak myself out. I had to ban myself from researching propofol after I realized it was the drug MJ died from. Then the doctor came by, and reassured me that the prep was the worst part and it‚Äôd be quick.  Before I knew it I was being wheeled into the OR, and there was about 3 women nurses there setting me up. They asked me to lay to my left, and I just focused on my breathing and told myself it‚Äôs okay. I felt pretty relaxed tbh. I was worried I might have a panic attack. After like a minute the anesthesiologist said ‚Äúokay im turning on the sedation‚Äù and I remember ‚ÄúI wonder how long this is going to take‚Ä¶‚Äù I literally slow blinked 2 times like I was in a movie and then I was out. I read some people it burned in the IV but I only felt a little bit of cold. It didn‚Äôt hurt. Then, I remember waking up and thinking I was at my home and idk if I said that or just thought it but then I was back asleep. And then I woke up to my nurse giving me water, and she said it went well. And then I fell back asleep, and then woke up again and the doctor was there. He said they found a small polyp that they removed, and hemorrhoids which was the cause of my issues. They showed me pictures but honestly I was still asleep lol. They brought me by clothes and let me get dressed, and I checked my phone it was 1:47! My appointment time was 1:45. It took just about an hour to do everything(I had filled out the paperwork online). I had slight gas pain in my stomach and the nurse said that was normal. I asked when id use the bathroom again and she said it might take a few days since there‚Äôs nothing in me. She brought a wheelchair and wheeled me out to get picked up. Then we went and ate Red Robin. I definitely had gas pains afterward for about an hour. It wasn‚Äôt anything bad, but it was the most pain I felt throughout the whole process. I also had a headache toward the end of the day, but I was probably dehydrated and didn‚Äôt have my daily coffee.

This morning I went to the bathroom as normal. 

All in all the experience was the best I could ask for. Everyone was kind and professional, and helped me relax. I was so anxious to do this I almost didn‚Äôt. But, my New Year‚Äôs resolution was ‚Äúbe afraid but do it anyway.‚Äù 
So I did it afraid. And now my mind is at ease knowing nothing serious was going on, and I think that‚Äôs worth it all. I have a follow up in 3 weeks with my GI so I‚Äôll see what his recommendations are for upcoming colonoscopies. 

But I just want to say for everyone who‚Äôs nervous, JUST DO IT!! It‚Äôs worth it to ensure there isn‚Äôt anything serious going on. the most pain I felt was the gas afterward and that was like 2.5/10! And if you can get the pills, I‚Äôd recommend them. Also stay off tiktok cause it‚Äôll just make you extra hungry. And get some baby wipes! ",1,1757685349.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

1nf3vc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/aypyoga/comments/1nf3vc7/lesson_320_kundalini_and_refined_sensory/,"Lesson 320 - Kundalini and Refined Sensory Perception, by Yogani","Q: I've practiced the AYP techniques for about 2.5 years now, and got an awakening after about six weeks. I've experienced most of the symptoms you describe, but do not have much third eye stuff or light shows. Felt like Superman, yes!

About a year ago I went to a large funeral. The deceased was a man who generated strong emotions, both positive and negative, in people. I came to terms with him long ago. I was shocked when during the ceremony, the kundalini, or energy, rose extraordinarily intensely. So much so, I thought I would have to leave the room and lie down, but I managed to get through it. That has convinced me beyond all doubt of the subtle communication between people that we're usually not aware of.

Sometimes I go to an open coffee shop/museum that used to be a bank in the 19th century. Kundalini almost inevitably rises strongly there. I wonder if it's the spirit of the place, or the interest/curiosity in me from the four or five people who work there.

Today I went to a casual event in a non-descript, modern, public building. It was very relaxed, but I didn't know the other 10 participants. (It was to drink organic juice made from organic vegetables.) I did know the coordinator, however, and have a relationship with that person of a somewhat greater degree. I was astonished when the kundalini began rising very strongly shortly after arrival. It was almost certainly not the result of the place, the event, or the people I did not know. I wondered how likely it was generated by the subtle emotions of the person I did know.

Then again, sometimes I get those rushes sitting alone in my room working at the computer for no apparent reason. How much of this is caused by people or events in our environment, and how much just happens on its own?

I would be most interested in your observations.

A: Part of the kundalini experience is a refinement of sensory perception, which corresponds with the rise of ecstatic conductivity. In traditional yoga, this is called ""pratyahara,"" meaning introversion of sensory perception. Along with this refinement we begin to experience our inner dimensions more clearly, and, at the same time, external environmental events will begin to affect us more deeply also, because our inside and outside are only different aspects of the one reality that we are.

This is how we become more empathetic as we advance spiritually. We ""feel"" what others feel, and are drawn more to ""do unto others"" as we would have others do unto us. Eventually we go beyond involvement in sensory perception altogether, to a constant divine outpouring, and that is true pratyahara.

The refinement of sensory perception also results in an increasing ability to perceive the finer vibratory quality of places, people, groups, etc., like the situations you described.

It is important not to get too carried away with these experiences, and continue to favor our routine of daily practice over our rising sensitivities and other ""siddhis"" that may occur.

So, carry on and enjoy the ride, but not to the point of being too distracted from the cause of your growth, which is practices.

1nf3u8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nf3u8h/should_i_allow_mom_to_design_my_home/,Should I allow Mom to design my home?,"I (35m) live in a 2 story, 3 bedroom house with my Girlfriend (J), Brother (30M), Brother's GF (M), and my friend (K). The house was purchased by my parents and we rent from them. J and I live in the master bedroom upstairs which is twice the size of the other rooms and has its own bathroom, and pay twice as much in rent. Brother and M share one room and K uses the third bedroom. There is a second bathroom in the basement.

Mom and Dad went above and beyond - not only did they buy a house for their kids and their kids' loved ones, they actually packed up their living room set - TV, beige sofas, coffee tables - and drove it across the country to furnish one of the living rooms. Then they bought matching rugs for the common areas.

Mom has an interest in interior design, but no professional experience. She has always designed very nice suburban middle class homes.

When we moved here, we brought a brown couch with us. It was in good shape and the tenants agreed to put it upstairs.

Mom demanded that we move the brown couch downstairs so her nicer beige couches could go in the main upstairs living room, would match the rugs, and in her words ""it will look like a nice place where adults live.""

Well, our upstairs cat claws couches, so before they brought the furniture, I told Mom: ""we would be glad to have your couches if you want to get rid of them, but you need to know that they will be damaged by the cat. If that's ok, we would love to have them. If not, we will go buy our own."" It was very important to her that we have matching furniture, so she brought the beige couches.

Fast forward a few months and the cat has clawed the beige couches. I have also moved a small WFH setup into the living room corner. Mom insists we now swap the couches again to bring the ""nice"" beige furniture downstairs and the ""ugly"" brown couch upstairs to be destroyed instead.

A while back, Brother and M decided they needed a bigger bed. Parents bought them a mattress - great! And then Mom selected and ordered a comforter that she thought would match everything make Brother's room look ""adult.""

In a recent conversation, Mom suggested that Brother/M and me/J swap bedrooms because K is my friend, not Brother's (although Brother, K, and I have lived together for 5 years at this point) so J and I should share a bathroom with K. Also Brother is always cold in the basement - it is usually around 68-70 deg down there while it is 76 upstairs.

Mom also thinks that I have ruined the ""adult"" appearance of the house by placing my WFH setup in the living room. I have been working from a bedroom office until now and it is very hard to keep quiet and not wake up J.

I asked Mom several times to please not relitigate the ""who gets what bedroom"" issue and explained that Brother and M can't afford the double rent upstairs anyway, so please let us decide what the inside of our living space will look like. Her response was that ""it's her house so it's up to her how much Brother owes for rent.""

Well, the only way they can afford the big bedroom is if Parents cover more than half of it, or if they shift a portion of Brother's rent onto the other tenants of the house.

I told Mom that she needs to stop playing Barbie dolls with our lives. We appreciate the help, but designing someone else's living space goes too far, especially when the occupants want something different. She has good taste but doesn't have the right to dictate how 5 adults in their 30s should arrange or decorate their home.

Mom feels that because she and dad bought the house, and she is ""only trying to look out for her boys and make sure both kids are comfortable and happy,"" she does in fact have the right to tell us what bedrooms to use, how to decorate, where to put work stations, and what bathrooms to use.

She told me that it was very mean to accuse her of ""playing Barbies with our lives"" and that I'm a person who lacks empathy for her poor other son. I'm disrespectful for the way I treat her and she is disappointed in the man that I've become.

Is she way over the line, or was I rude and cruel to describe her actions as ""playing Barbies with my life?""",2,1757685154.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

*Then what am I really afraid of? If not Charlie‚Ä¶*

*‚Ä¶will he?*

Only once the food is in the icebox do we sit down on the couch and begin our less-than-pleasant conversation.

‚ÄúAlright, Kosie. It‚Äôs private now. What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

Terrible memories fill my mind, and I struggle to stay composed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go back to Wriss.‚Äù I say in a choked voice.

Charlie, sensing the distress in my voice, leans forward. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you? Did something happen? Some*one*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I can‚Äôt. My father‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù I can‚Äôt go any further. I break down, sobs choking my voice. I close my eyes, tears dripping down my snout. Charlie moves closer to me, and I almost pull away until he wraps his arms around me, placing his head on my shoulder and leaning on my neck. His warmth, the beat of his heart‚Ä¶ I place my own head on his shoulder, and let it all out. Minutes pass, the only sound my slowly ebbing sobs and snorts.

I manage to stop crying, and we pull apart. Charlie goes and finds a roll of what he calls ‚Äòpaper towels‚Äô, because ‚Äònormal tissues would be next to useless for me‚Äô. I clear my congested nose and wipe my snout clean.

*It‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre okay. You can tell him.*

‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù I say as I resettle myself. ‚ÄúMy father‚Ä¶ believes in the old ways. That Betterment was the way. ‚ÄòCulling the weak improves the stock‚Äô is something he‚Äôd say. On Wriss, we have a very strict process to our marriages. The female would stay with her parents until a suitable male would present themselves and ask for the female. I am my father‚Äôs only offspring, and my mother died when I was young. The way that wealth works on Wriss is it passes from father to son, so when I became of age, my father began looking for suitors for me. None met his standards for a long time, and I think at some point he started blaming me.

‚ÄúHe told me himself that I wasn‚Äôt attracting the right males, and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs stuck with me. He began to punish me. First it happened every time he rejected another suitor, and the cost was light. Just yelling and sometimes insults about how I was worthless and should be culled. But the frequency and harshness of his judgements increased.‚Äù

I pause, gathering my thoughts for the next part.

‚ÄúI remember the first time he hit me. At first it was just the back of his claw, but then he started scratching me. Soon he would start isolating me, saying I didn‚Äôt deserve to be seen in public with him. He began drinking at that time, and everything went downhill from there.

I started running, but he would always find me. Beat me, lock me in my room. He once tied me to my bed with rope. That‚Äôs when I knew I had to get off Wriss. I heard of an off-world exchange program with Terrans, and I disappeared. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing, but I know I can‚Äôt go back to Wriss or he‚Äôll find me. He always finds me‚Ä¶‚Äù

I curl tighter into myself, but I feel so much more‚Ä¶ *free.* Charlie leans forward.

‚ÄúKosie, if I had known‚Ä¶ You know what? Doesn‚Äôt matter. Now that I *do* know, I‚Äôm making sure you‚Äôre not sent back. I‚Äôll protect you even if your dad, no, if *that guy* comes all the way here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you even *do* that? You forgive me for acting like we‚Äôve never met, you protect someone who you‚Äôve only known for a few \[months\], you stab a Gojid and risk getting stabbed yourself?‚Äù I say, almost incredulous at his ability to ‚Äòroll with the punches‚Äô, as Terrans say. Anyone else would‚Äôve abandoned me.

Charlie reaches under his collar and pulls out a metal chain with a charm of two crossed lines on it. ‚ÄúMy religion commands it. My God says for me to do to others as I want done to me, and He helps me with doing so. I am called to forgive even when no one else does, help even when no one else does, and stand for what‚Äôs right even when no one else does. I knew something was wrong, and I wanted to help; no holy prodding needed.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes your deity do this as well?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course! He modeled it for us in our scriptures. If you‚Äôre interested, I could find you a copy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Thank you.‚Äù *I‚Äôll have to look into his religion. A deity that forgives their subjects? That‚Äôs almost ridiculous next to the Wrissian pantheon.*

‚ÄúIs that all you needed to say?‚Äù Charlie asks, and he dips his head slightly. ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ want another hug? Both?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù I say, and Charlie wraps me up one more time. After he releases me, I feel‚Ä¶ lighter, like I‚Äôve removed an exercise vest I didn‚Äôt know I had on.

*Both is good.*

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Charlie says as I wipe my snout one last time, ‚Äúwhatever you eat after you cry doesn‚Äôt have any calories, according to what I‚Äôve heard. How do you feel about staying home, making some popcorn and bacon, and watching some classic Terran movies?‚Äù

I definitely do not have the ‚Äòsocial battery‚Äô, as the Terrans call it, to go out again today. Plus, there would be bacon if we stayed, and I was *not* saying no to that.

Less than \[fifteen minutes\] later, Charlie and I are back on the couch with a couple blankets and a large bowl of popcorn liberally sprinkled with bacon crumbs (my idea).

‚ÄúAlright Kosie, what do you feel like watching, genre-wise?‚Äù Charlie asks as he clicks the ‚Äòtelevision‚Äô on. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs romance, comedy, action, anything feel like something you want?‚Äù

*Dear \[deity of abundance\], there‚Äôs so many choices‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say something about ‚Äòclassics‚Äô?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúWell yes, but that basically just means any good movie from over 50 years ago. I do, however, have a suggestion if you‚Äôre not very squeamish. Can you handle blood and suspense?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a holovid like that. I‚Äôve mostly seen documentaries and whatever just happened to be on the holoscreen. But I‚Äôve been around blood a lot, so the only thing I don‚Äôt understand is ‚Äòsuspense‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, suspense is like unease. A gut feeling that tells you something bad is about to happen to someone. You‚Äôll understand when we watch the movie.‚Äù

He navigates to a streaming service, and starts one of the video files. As it loads, he hops off the couch and flips off the lights, dimming the room until the screen is the only light. He retakes his seat and readjusts his blanket just as a strange keening noise begins to come from the speakers.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this holovid called?‚Äù I whisper to him, not wanting to interrupt the noise in case it was part of the movie.

‚ÄúJurassic Park.‚Äù

The noise coming from the speakers, I inferred as the movie continued, was in fact Terran music created to specifically accompany this film. It affected me in a way I never expected. At times my stomach clenched and my tail lashed in fear, and at others I nearly cried for the second time in \[two hours\]. The human called Robert was currently lying on the ground, locking eyes with a velociraptor. As the dangerous reptile‚Äôs head poked from the foliage, I nearly believed I was looking at another Arxur.

‚ÄúClever girl‚Ä¶‚Äù Robert says, and the camera cuts away as his three stalkers lunge in.

Later in the movie, the two younglings are attempting to escape from the velociraptors themselves by hiding inside of a building. They close a door, and I find myself sighing in relief.

*Surely they are safe now. Now all they must do is wait for the adult Terrans to find them.*

But the camera didn‚Äôt begin following one of the other actors. A clench of fear comes over me, and my tail lashes in agitation. The door handle begins to twitch as the reptiles paw at it.

*They wouldn‚Äôt!*

The raptors enter the kitchen, and the children attempt to hide. The older female tries to shut a cabinet door as one sees her, and the reptile sprints towards her. I begin to panic with the child, thinking that I‚Äôm about to see her death, but the raptor slams into what was merely a reflection. I only now realize my muscles are tensed for action, and my heart is racing.

The movie eventually ends, with triumphant blaring from the speakers as the actors finally escape the island of death.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you think, Kosie?‚Äù Charlie asks as a list of Terran words and names begins to scroll upwards on a black screen.

‚ÄúHow is it possible to love and hate something at the same time?‚Äù I say, incredulous at how easily my emotions were swayed by a fictitious narrative.

‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs eight more in the series if you want to keep watching, but I really only have time for one more before my diurnal butt has to get to bed.‚Äù

Being nocturnal, I don‚Äôt have such limitations. ‚ÄúDid you have any others you wanted to show me?‚Äù

He makes a short humming noise. ‚ÄúLemme think.‚Äù He stares off into space, absentmindedly stroking the short fuzz on his chin. I begin eating the crumbs at the bottom of the long-empty popcorn tub.

*Why did this taste so good and vanish so fast?*

‚ÄúOoh!‚Äù I hear Charlie say, and he picks up the remote control again.

‚ÄúWhat are we watching now?‚Äù I ask as I lick the last of the bacon dust from the bowl.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a children‚Äôs movie, also pretty old, but it was mine and my mom‚Äôs favorite as I grew up. This one‚Äôs called Up.‚Äù

He hits ‚ÄòPlay‚Äô, and sounds like hammers hitting metal strings begin to come from the speakers. This one is animated, the humans shaped strangely but recognizably.

It starts with a male human child exploring an old house, looking for his lost balloon. He meets a loud, pushy human girl there, and she tries to help him get his balloon and he ends up with an injured arm. Then the movie shifts, almost making the music more important than what was on the screen as it showed time in fast-forward, moving through the two friends‚Äô lives together. I see them become mates, then the woman crying in a bathroom, and the two growing old together. They had a jar of money that they kept smashing, where they kept their savings for the promise that the woman exacted from her now-husband. But then‚Ä¶

*She DIES?! It‚Äôs barely started!*

Where Jurassic Park had me fearing for the actor‚Äôs lives, this movie had me semi-praying to gods I only used as relevant expletives that nothing would happen to the talking animal. I quietly hissed in anger at Dug‚Äôs mistreatment, and I can only hope that Charlie didn‚Äôt notice how emotionally invested I was in the film.

As the credits began to roll, my heart could only be described as full.

Charlie flicks off the screen, rises, and stretches. I hear multiple concerning creaks and snaps from his joints as he flexes his back and neck. He notices me staring at him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just air build-up. Now, I‚Äôm going to bed. I don‚Äôt know how sleepy you are right now, but I will see you in the morning.‚Äù

As he turns away, a thought comes to me. ‚ÄúIs it okay if I keep watching movies?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúHuh? Oh, sure. Just keep it down and don‚Äôt pay for anything. If you liked Up, stick with watching Disney pre-2030s. Start with‚Ä¶‚Äù Charlie‚Äôs mouth gapes open, displaying his short canines and blunted tongue. ‚ÄúStart with Big Hero 6, maybe move on to The Bad Guys after that if you‚Äôre not tired. Goodnight.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodnight, Charlie.‚Äù

Five hours later, after watching both suggested movies, I sat on the couch amazed at the diversity of Terran storytelling. The music, the color, it connected you to itself so easily! You felt for the characters as though they were sitting right next to you!

I power down the television. My mouth stretches open in a gaping yawn, and I blink slowly as the weight of my tiredness hits me.

*These blankets are so warm, and my bed is so far away‚Ä¶*

Without even realizing it, I lay down on the couch, pulling the two covers over myself.

*Lemme just lay down for a* \[second\] *before I go, I‚Äôll get up, don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶*

My alarm chirps twice, jolting me from my slumber. 6:00 AM. I‚Äôm instantly awake, my brain falling into its typical routine.

*Clean clothes, shower, brush.*

My thoughts are interrupted by a breathy, wheezy snort. I don‚Äôt jump, but I am very curious as to what made the noise. I poke my head from my bedroom, and I hear the sound again. It‚Äôs coming from the TV, or at least I think it is until I spot the end of a tail curled over the arm of the sofa.

*Ha! Kosie snores.* She does it again. *Man, she is NOT going to believe how bad it sounds.*

I walk over, careful to control my steps. She‚Äôs laid out on the couch, using both the blankets to keep warm.

*This is actually kinda cute. I definitely understand why people love hosting aliens.*

I reach for her shoulder to jostle her awake, but I freeze as I remember the conversation we had last night.

*Her abusive past likely means she doesn‚Äôt like being scared or suddenly touched. She‚Äôs only been here for a couple days, so she hasn‚Äôt adjusted fully. Also, five of her six ends are pointy, and the last one‚Äôs a club.*

My hand was mere inches from touching her, and I very carefully pull away.

*Better to wake her up more passively.*

I pop open the fridge and start making breakfast.

*Hmm‚Ä¶ I need to pick up the stuff for sausage gravy next time we‚Äôre out‚Ä¶ and get more bacon.*

My nose twitches as I stir awake.

*Mmm‚Ä¶ meat‚Ä¶*

I try to roll off my bed to my feet, but I‚Äôm met with a cushiony blockade.

*Squishy wall‚Ä¶*

I roll the other way and crash to the floor. I hiss in pain, holding the side of my head as I slowly rise.

*Ow‚Ä¶*

I blink my eyes open slowly, and the light hurts as it hits my brain. As I try to stand, I stagger slightly from fatigue and I see Charlie rush towards me.

‚ÄúHey, good morning, sleepyhead. Did you get good rest on the couch?‚Äù

I groan, and a muscle in my neck spasms, causing me to hiss again. I feel Charlie‚Äôs arms wrap around my back, supporting some of my weight. It takes me a few seconds through my throbbing headache, but I manage to spit a few words out.

‚ÄúOutside. Sun. Warm.‚Äù

Charlie seems to understand, and he helps me carry myself out into the backyard. I kneel on the grass, and Charlie helps lower me until I‚Äôm lying on the ground in a large patch of sunlight. I close my eyes again, and time slips away.

I wake again, much more gracefully this time. As I stand, I brush the dirt and plant matter from myself and walk inside. My headache hasn‚Äôt lessened very much, and I‚Äôm still tired, but at least I‚Äôm tired with a normal heart rate.

*Is this what a hangover‚Äôs like?*

I‚Äôve never partaken in that particular vice, but from what I‚Äôve heard from others, this is a pretty close copy. Charlie looks up from his food as I walk in, a look of what I believe to be concern on his face.

‚ÄúAre you okay now? You seemed quite out of it a second ago.‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúI made you a plate, by the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than I was. When I get up, I need to get myself outside and into the sun to wake up the rest of the way. I haven‚Äôt had much sleep, so I needed a little help to drag myself out. Thanks for the help.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no problem. Do you need anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôve got something for headaches and fatigue, no.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs it so happens, I‚Äôve got just the thing for that. I picked up a coffee machine and some grounds on some advice I got from an exchange veteran. It‚Äôll help with the pain and tiredness, but it‚Äôs also mildly addictive.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou had me at ‚Äòhelp with the pain‚Äô.‚Äù

Charlie laughs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you how to brew it when you‚Äôre done eating. Lemme go get you a cup.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat advice was it you got from the veteran?‚Äù I ask as I begin to eat my ‚Äòbreakfast‚Äô, as Charlie calls it.

‚ÄúGet coffee. Xenos love it, and they‚Äôre inevitably going to mess up their own sleep schedule while they‚Äôre here, so have it on hand. Just don‚Äôt leave them alone with a full pot.‚Äù

*Is it that addictive?*

‚ÄúIs coffee really that addictive?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor nonhumans, yes. It‚Äôs a stimulant, and we‚Äôve already had enough close-calls and sadness from aliens getting addicted and having heart attacks after drinking 5-Hour Energy‚Äôs and Monsters. Coffee‚Äôs one of the milder substances, but it‚Äôs quite controlled on other planets. In all honesty, energy drinks in general are highly controlled off Earth.‚Äù

Charlie fiddles with a strange black box-like machine while we talk, pouring water in the top and placing a ceramic cup underneath a spout. A few minutes later, the box splutters, and a dark brown liquid that smells strangely of dirt pours into the earthen glass.

‚ÄúCareful, its hot.‚Äù Charlie says as he places the mug on the table next to me. ‚ÄúDo you prefer sweet, creamy drinks, or would you rather it bitter?‚Äù

*Well, there was that sweet* \[fruit juice\] *I really liked back on Wriss, but this obviously isn‚Äôt fruit. Let‚Äôs try a sip of it as-is.*

I lift the glass, and blow the thick vapor rising from it. A few breaths later, I slowly take a sip. The brown liquid instantly scalds my tongue, and I barely manage to keep from dropping the drink. I hiss, and my tail lashes as I wait out the pain.

‚ÄúKosie, you okay?‚Äù I hear Charlie ask from elsewhere in the house.

‚ÄúBurnt tongue.‚Äù I reply.

I hear a sharp intake of breath. ‚ÄúOoh, yeah. Not the greatest intro to coffee. Blow on it a little more, and it should be fine to drink in a minute.‚Äù

I leave the cup be as I eat, and only take another exploratory taste when the rising vapors are much less thick. The flavor is almost muddy, and very bitter, but not bad. After a minute of slow sips, I feel my headache begin to subside, and I sit up a little straighter.

*Dear \[deity of extraordinary circumstances\], this drink practically works miracles of its own!*

It‚Äôs gone all too soon, but I‚Äôm enjoying the effects. Instead of sitting tired with a headache, I am now without the headache, less tired, and my heart is beating only a *little* faster than normal.

Charlie walks in as I‚Äôm cleaning up my plate and cup, and he‚Äôs smiling as I turn to him.

‚ÄúHey Kosie, the government fun money just came in, and you know what?‚Äù

*No, what?*

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I ask, curious as to where this is going.

‚ÄúI know what we‚Äôre gonna do today!‚Äù",4,1757684977.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1nf3rk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nf3rk2/the_tunnel_walk_part_1_translated_from_serbian_to/,The Tunnel Walk (Part 1)       (translated from Serbian to English),"Martin had always been afraid of the dark, a fear that had stayed with him since childhood. He couldn‚Äôt imagine a night without the TV on to keep him company, or at the very least leaving the light on in his room before falling asleep. Martin is now 62 years old, living in a bustling city in apartment number 217. His children, who now have children of their own, live in the village of The New Dawn where he himself grew up, but Martin wouldn‚Äôt return there no matter how much money someone offered him. He was simply an old man living alone, surviving each day while hoping that his childhood trauma wouldn‚Äôt come back.

It was now 2:45 in the afternoon. Martin had just returned from work. His weak, shaky hands slowly unlocked the door to his apartment. He went inside, shut the door behind him, turned on the light, and locked it. He walked through his apartment, turning on the lights wherever there was a switch‚Äîthe hallway, the bedroom, the bathroom, the living room, and the kitchen. Then he stepped out onto the balcony, where he kept a white plastic chair and a small wooden table. He opened a can of beer and gazed into the distance, recalling his childhood.

**April 16, 2018**

Spring break had just started for Martin and his friends. That day it was raining, and as he ran home through the downpour, he pulled out his phone and blasted music loudly, soaked to the skin but not caring about the cold that would catch up with him in a few days. He was just happy that break had finally started‚Äîno school, no responsibilities, the only concern being where he and his friends would go to play.

When he got home, he threw his schoolbag into the corner of his room, where it would stay for the next few months. He sat down in his chair, staring out the window and saying to himself, *‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe break has started,‚Äù* holding his head in his hands and still thinking about it. Since it rained for the rest of the day, there wasn‚Äôt much else he could do. He stayed in his small attic room, playing video games on the computer with his friends. At night he went to sleep, and during the night the rain stopped, preparing a beautiful day for playing tomorrow.

In the morning when he woke up, he saw the sun‚Äôs rays shyly peeking through the blinds of his window. He turned to the other side, away from the sun, but it was already too late‚Äîhe was awake, and nothing in the world could put him back to sleep. Groggily, he got out of bed, too tired to even look at the sunny day outside. He made his bed, got dressed, and went to the bathroom for his morning routine: relieving himself, brushing his teeth, and flexing in front of the mirror while making faces.

He went downstairs to the kitchen, where he found his father and mother drinking their morning coffee. The smell of coffee filled the kitchen, and he liked it‚Äîhe loved the smell of coffee. But his parents didn‚Äôt let him drink it. According to them, he was still too young and it might make him grow a tail. He wasn‚Äôt sure if that was true, but even the slightest chance of it was enough to keep him from wanting to try coffee for now.

He ate chocolate cereal with warm milk for breakfast. It was already ten o‚Äôclock, and he had arranged with his friends to meet outside. Feeling more awake, he took his parents‚Äô old white bicycle and set off on an adventure.

First, he went to Jovan‚Äôs house, who lived two corners away. Jovan had just started breakfast, so Martin had to endure an awkward five minutes sitting with his parents in the living room while he finished eating. When Jovan was finally done, he brought out his brand-new bicycle, which he had received for his 14th birthday just last week.

Martin and Jovan then rode over to Marko‚Äôs place. Marko came out immediately when he saw them trying to force open his gate with their bikes, since they didn‚Äôt realize it was locked. It didn‚Äôt help that they were shouting his nickname at the top of their lungs.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôve you been, Maki? What took you so long, did you go poop?‚Äù Jovan teased when he saw him coming out of the house, carrying an old green backpack on his shoulders.

‚ÄúHa-ha, very funny. I‚Äôd tell you now, but I‚Äôll wait till later,‚Äù Marko replied in a quieter voice.

Marko didn‚Äôt have a bike, but he did have a scooter. He went into the garage and brought out his nearly new scooter, covered with soccer player stickers, and set off with them. Their next stop was at Sara‚Äôs place, but they learned she had gone to visit someone outside the village and wouldn‚Äôt be back for a week. They were a little disappointed‚ÄîSara was fun to be around‚Äîbut not too much. They liked Sara, but they didn‚Äôt mind today being just a boys‚Äô day, so they continued along the asphalt road, then began pushing their rides once the path turned into dirt. They could ride their bikes on the dirt, but Marko couldn‚Äôt with his scooter, so they pushed alongside him. They pushed through a small patch of woods, looking at nature and imagining how cool it would be if a dinosaur suddenly came out of there‚Äîif not a dinosaur, then at least a snake or something similar.

Eventually, they arrived at a pond of green water where frogs watched them suspiciously from the surface as the boys approached their home. A few meters from the pond, they set down their bikes and scooter. Marko took off his backpack, crouched, and began pulling something out.

‚ÄúBro, did you take those magazines from your dad?‚Äù Jovan asked, glancing at Martin and laughing softly.

Marko, in a squeaky voice, mimicked his laugh and said, ‚ÄúHa-ha, you‚Äôre sooo funny, I could just die.‚Äù

From his bag, Marko pulled out a roll of fishing line and two closed metal tins.

‚ÄúHow many did you catch?‚Äù Martin asked, also taking two metal tins from his pockets. Jovan followed, doing the same.

‚ÄúSix and ten. You?‚Äù Marko asked.

‚ÄúEight and nine,‚Äù Jovan replied, opening his tins to show the others.

‚ÄúI wanted to make it even‚Äîten and ten,‚Äù Martin said.

Now all three of them were crouched, setting their tins on the ground. Each tin contained dirt with worms, while the others were filled with flies with their wings torn off.

‚ÄúEveryone make your own rod, that tree over there is perfect,‚Äù Marko said, pointing at a tree in the distance. They went to it, and each began looking around for the longest stick they could find. Once everyone had one, they stood in a circle, waiting for Marko to take scissors and a plastic box of hooks in different sizes out of his bag. They began cutting pieces of line, tying them to the ends of their sticks, and fastening hooks on the other ends. All three of them managed to do it, and admired what they had made.

They spent the rest of the day playing around the pond, trying to catch whatever lived there. There were fish‚Äîthey had seen them‚Äîbut they rarely caught any. Most often, what they hooked were frogs, which they later found disgusting to remove from the hooks before throwing them back into the water.

When night fell and it was time to head home, Jovan came up with a great idea.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play hide-and-seek!‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought we were done for today, but‚Ä¶ we could play for maybe half an hour, then we really need to go,‚Äù Martin replied.

‚ÄúWhat, are you scared of the dark?‚Äù Jovan teased, making ghost noises like in cartoons.

‚ÄúNo, but unlike *somebody*, my parents actually love me and will worry if I don‚Äôt come home soon.‚Äù

After a few minutes of sulking and losing at rock-paper-scissors, it was decided that Martin would be the first to count while the others hid. But before the game started, Martin asked:

‚ÄúWait, where are the hiding spots? I mean, from where to where?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ from the start of the pond to‚Ä¶ see that slope over there? Up to there.‚Äù

Martin knew what was near that slope. He didn‚Äôt want to go there. He hoped he‚Äôd find them in other spots and wouldn‚Äôt have to check that area. He stood by a tree, covered his eyes with his hand, and started counting from one to one hundred. With his eyes shut, he could hear the rustle of footsteps in the grass moving away in different directions, along with faint whispers. But he also heard something else.

It wasn‚Äôt his stomach, it wasn‚Äôt an earthquake‚Äîit was thunder.

When he finished counting to one hundred, he turned around and opened his eyes.

‚ÄúWhoever didn‚Äôt hide is a donkey!‚Äù he shouted out loud and began to look around. There weren‚Äôt many places they could hide‚Äîeither in thick grass, behind a tree, up in a tree, or maybe‚Ä¶ at *that* place. Obviously, Jovan and Marko weren‚Äôt bothered by the thunder, but Martin wanted to find them as quickly as possible and go home. He could hear the wind shaking the tree branches and see the grass beneath his feet swaying.

He picked up his pace as the wind grew stronger, when suddenly he heard someone calling his name. He wasn‚Äôt sure which one of the two it was, but it had the voice of a child. The sound came from a distance‚Äîstraight from the direction of that slope, the only place he hadn‚Äôt checked yet.

As he got closer, the voice grew clearer. It was Jovan, he knew it, he was sure of it. Then he reached the slope, and there it was‚Äîthe tunnel.

A gaping hole in the massive mountain, believed to be one of the largest in the world. The tunnel cutting through it was said to be the longest in the world. Martin stood on the tracks, staring into the abyss of its dark depths. The entrance was decorated with carved stone, and among them a child had once etched: *‚ÄúAbandon hope, all ye who enter here.‚Äù*

The tunnel was so long that even during the day you couldn‚Äôt see light at the other end, even though it ran straight through. It would surely take hours upon hours to walk from one side to the other. His parents always warned him never to go inside. They constantly told him stories of children who had gone in and never had time to get out before a train crushed them. That‚Äôs why Martin feared this place so much.

He was about to call for Jovan and Marko, to tell them he had to go home, when suddenly the two of them jumped out of the tunnel and screamed at him.

Martin was so terrified that he screamed back, fell onto his back, and began breathing heavily. The two ran up to him to see if he was okay.

‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!‚Äù he shouted at them. They apologized, and after a few minutes of explaining it was just a joke, they went back for their bikes and scooter and headed home.

When Martin returned, he left his bike in the garage and went inside. Even though it was vacation and he had no obligations, his parents weren‚Äôt happy that he came home so late. He told them he got carried away playing and hadn‚Äôt noticed the time. As he spoke, he heard the sound of raindrops tapping against the kitchen window. *At least you got home before the rain,* his parents said, then sent him to his room with a warning to come back earlier next time.

He played computer games for another two hours before going to bed. But before falling asleep, he remembered that tunnel. Sleepiness finally overcame him, and he drifted off through his fear.

That night, he dreamed of the tunnel‚Äîhow he had gotten lost inside, searching desperately for an exit. The ghosts of the children who had died there tried to show him the way out. But before he managed to escape the tunnel, his mother woke him for breakfast.

\* \* \* \* \*

Not far past the pond were the ruins of a house in the forest‚Äînow just a few crumbling walls that once made up someone‚Äôs home. Long ago, it had been the house of David and Sadeta Pe≈°iƒá.

As parents told their children, the couple had wanted to flee from the eyes of the world, afraid of the war, and so they hid in that forest and built themselves a small home. Although in hiding, they often gave shelter to wounded people who stumbled across their house, taking them in and nursing them back to health.

Soon word spread about them through the nearby village, which wasn‚Äôt very large at the time. Many people began coming to them for treatment, paying them with money. They had made their own garden where they grew vegetables and medicinal herbs, and they fished in the pond.

But unfortunately, the wrong ears heard of their house. A few days later, the two of them were found dead inside their home.

During the bombings, their house was struck and reduced to what it is today. In their honor, near where their garden once was, there still stands a monument to this day, regularly maintained.

After the war ended, it was discovered that thousands of enemy soldiers had tried to secretly attack the village. They attempted to use the tunnel that cut through the mountain‚Äîwhere the train now runs‚Äîas a shortcut. Back then, however, the tracks hadn‚Äôt yet been laid.

They thought it was an easy way to sneak through. But large numbers of soldiers disappeared inside that tunnel. The enemy began to believe it was filled with traps, or that ambushes awaited them inside. So they stopped using it.

\* \* \* \* \*

As he was getting out of bed, he felt the vibration of his phone lying on the nightstand next to him. It was Marko, who wanted Martin, Marko, and Jovan to meet at his place‚Äîthey could play video games, and when they got bored, they could head over to Sara‚Äôs to see if she had recovered enough to play.

After breakfast, which consisted of scrambled eggs, bread, and milk, he left the house, breathing in the scent of the fresh morning. He took his bike and set off toward his destination.

When he arrived in front of Marko‚Äôs house, he could already see Jovan‚Äôs bike leaning against a tree in the yard. He grabbed Jovan‚Äôs bike, hid it in the bushes behind the house, and leaned his own bike against that same tree. He knocked on the door, and after a few seconds, he heard footsteps. Marko‚Äôs mother opened the door and directed him to Marko‚Äôs room.

Marko and Jovan were already deep into a video game, sitting on the carpeted floor of his room and playing some kind of shooter on the console. When Martin entered the room, they greeted him without looking away from the TV screen. Jovan cursed quietly when he died in the game and set his controller aside, stretching out across the floor. Marko lightly punched him in the stomach for that, which made Jovan sit up straight and glance at him in disappointment.

‚ÄúI thought you were better than that,‚Äù he said, giving him a light slap on the head.

Marko switched the game to one that all three of them could play, and they played together for about two hours. They took a break when Marko‚Äôs mother called them for lunch. After eating, they played another fifteen minutes or so before leaving the house.

They thought about going to Sara‚Äôs. Martin took his bike, Marko grabbed his scooter, while Jovan gave Martin a suspicious look.

‚ÄúWhat? Why are you looking at me like that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou know why I‚Äôm looking at you. Where‚Äôs my bike?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHow should I know where your bike is?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou came last, don‚Äôt mess around. Just tell me so we can go.‚Äù

Martin pointed to the bushes behind the house. When Jovan found his bike, he shot Martin a look that clearly said, *‚ÄúSee, I knew you knew where my bike was.‚Äù*

They rode over to Sara‚Äôs. Her mother told them she was feeling better today, but still not fully recovered, and that they should come back tomorrow‚Äîthen she would let her out.

The boys continued into the forest, just like the day before, but this time they didn‚Äôt go to the pond. Instead, they went a little further‚Äînot too far, about a five-minute walk past the pond. There lay the ruins of an old house. Their parents had often told them stories about the war that had taken place there and how it had affected the development of the village. They often came here to play war games.

Usually, there were four of them‚Äîtwo would attack the house while the other two defended it. They‚Äôd use pebbles, sticks, and similar things, but recently, the four of them, including Sara, had bought plastic toy guns with pellets.

Jovan bought a pump-action shotgun that shot five pellets at once, a rubber knife, and a pellet pistol. Marko bought a sniper rifle that fired one pellet but shot much farther and hit much harder, plus the same extra gear as Jovan. Martin bought a simple rifle‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt even know its name‚Äîbut it shot very fast, along with the same equipment as the others. Sara‚Äôs guns they hadn‚Äôt seen yet.

They agreed that Marko, with his sniper, would climb up to the second floor of the house and keep watch, trying to spot Martin and Jovan as they tried to sneak up from different directions. To make it fair, Jovan and Martin only used their pistols and rubber knives, leaving their other guns hidden in a bush.

While Martin stood behind the house, planning to climb in through a broken window to sneak up on Marko, someone grabbed him from behind and covered his mouth with a hand. Martin bit the person, forcing them to pull their hand away for a moment, and he screamed. Marko and Jovan heard him and rushed over.

It was Vladimir and Vuk. They went to the same school but were two years older. Marko and Jovan raised their pistols and pointed them at the boys, after which they let Martin go.

‚ÄúOh, what will I do now that you‚Äôve got those little baby toys? Oh, I know‚Äîthese are toys for grown-ups,‚Äù said Vuk as he and Vladimir pulled out guns they had hidden behind their backs.

They were *their* guns‚Äîthe ones the boys had stashed away. How long had they been watching them? ‚ÄúBro, give us back the guns, this isn‚Äôt funny,‚Äù Jovan said.  
‚ÄúOkay, but first throw yours on the ground, and then I want something else,‚Äù Vuk replied with a grin. They threw their pistols onto the ground.  
‚ÄúNow turn around and walk forward,‚Äù he ordered. They did as they were told. As they walked, the two older boys steered them whenever they tried to turn away. Martin felt his blood run cold when he realized where they were leading them. They stopped in front of the tunnel ‚Äî the same tunnel that haunted his nightmares. Even on a clear, sunny day you couldn‚Äôt see the other end.

‚ÄúNow you go inside. You‚Äôll stay in there five minutes, then you can come out and we‚Äôll give you your toys back. It‚Äôs a test to see if you‚Äôre babies or men ‚Äî to see whether babies are afraid of the dark.‚Äù

Martin almost vomited. He turned to them.  
‚ÄúI ‚Äî I can‚Äôt. Can I do something else?‚Äù he stammered, stepping backward to put more distance between himself and the tunnel. Vladimir grabbed him lightly and tried to pull him back to where the others were near the tunnel, but in protest Martin accidentally hit him in the nose. Vladimir turned, put his hands to his nose ‚Äî there wasn‚Äôt a stream of blood, but it still hurt.

‚ÄúSorry man, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Äî‚Äù he began, but Vladimir swung and hit him in the nose before he could finish. Martin fell to the ground, clutching the spot where he‚Äôd been struck; blood began to run. While he lay there, Vladimir grabbed his foot and started dragging him along the ground. When they reached the tunnel, Jovan and Marko shoved him into it together. Inside the tunnel, Martin heard the sound of Vladimir falling to the ground. As Marko helped Martin to his feet, Jovan picked up a rock and whacked Vladimir on the head as he tried to get up, knocking him back down. Vuk tried to run after them but tripped and fell.

They ran back toward the house, grabbed their bikes ‚Äî Jovan took his bike and Martin sat behind him, clinging to him ‚Äî while Marko took Martin‚Äôs bike. They rode slowly through the forest until the downhill slope gave them a little push. As they rode they felt a small tremor, like a minor earthquake. They didn‚Äôt see Vuk running after them, nor Vladimir. That was the end of playing for the day. Marko reached his house and gave Martin his bike back, saying Martin could ride it now. Martin rode home and told his parents what had happened. Marko‚Äôs father drove to the pond and then walked to the ruined house, where he found Marko‚Äôs scooter, put it in his trunk, and returned it to Marko, who thanked him. Marko‚Äôs parents took care of his nosebleed; Martin locked himself in his room and spent the rest of the day playing computer games.

\* \* \* \* \*

The next day, Martin walked through the living room where his father lay on the couch while his mother made dinner in the kitchen; both were watching television. On the screen he saw photos of Vuk and Vladimir ‚Äî they were missing. Their parents said the boys had gone out the previous day and never returned. They hadn‚Äôt had any big arguments; they got along well and wouldn‚Äôt have run away. The police were currently searching for them. Before dinner Martin ran to his room, grabbed his phone, and called Jovan.

‚ÄúDude, I just saw on the news that those two from yesterday are missing. Did you see the news?‚Äù Martin asked as he paced.  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt watch. What do you think happened to them? Do you think it happened after we ran away?‚Äù Jovan replied.  
‚ÄúTo be honest, I didn‚Äôt see anyone running after us while we were fleeing.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to tell you. Maybe they fell into some hole or something ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know. I trust the police will find them, ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right. The police will find them ‚Äî and even if they don‚Äôt, who cares? At least we‚Äôll be able to play in peace.‚Äù  
‚ÄúExactly. Alright then, talk to you later.‚Äù After that, they hung up and didn‚Äôt speak for the rest of the day.

Five years ago, a great tragedy struck the village of The New Dawn, when a passenger train carrying thirty-two people ‚Äî fifteen men, thirteen women, and four children ‚Äî disappeared. On April 17, 2013, at two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, the train passed through The New Dawn and stopped at the last station in the village, where it picked up two more passengers before continuing into the tunnel. It never came out the other side. The train was never found, nor were the passengers. The news didn‚Äôt report it, nor did the papers. No one spoke about it. It was a sad subject for anyone in the village, since everyone knew at least one of the passengers. Friends and families spoke of the tragedy among themselves, but outside the village no one knew. Only a week later, another four children lost their lives when, during a game of hide-and-seek, they hid inside the tunnel. A train sped through, and the children had no time to escape. After that, the tunnel was officially closed, and trains no longer passed through the village.

\* \* \* \* \*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Though the mountain has a grim appearance because of the tunnel and its dark history, it remains very popular with tourists. Because of its massive size, the mountain has many hiking and walking trails. People go there both for exercise and for the views, as well as to see the animals living in the forest and on the mountain ‚Äî rabbits, snakes, deer, black bears, squirrels, and owls.

Today, Martin, Jovan, Marko, and Sara decided to climb the mountain. They packed bags with homemade sandwiches from their mothers, snacks, water, and juices. Over the phone, they agreed to meet at the pond at five in the afternoon since they all had things to do and couldn‚Äôt go earlier. Martin thought he was the first to arrive when Jovan jumped out from behind a tree and scared him. Martin swore, and the two of them agreed to hide and scare the next one who arrived.

The next to come was Sara. The two boys jumped out, and she screamed, saying she was going home. Then she began to cry. The boys ran after her to calm her down, but she turned and revealed that she was actually laughing.  
‚ÄúI was kidding ‚Äî I saw Jovan‚Äôs head before you ducked down,‚Äù she said. Then the three of them hid again, this time with Jovan and Martin lying in the bushes by the forest path while Sara stood behind a tree not far away.

When Marko arrived last, Jovan and Martin grabbed his leg from the bushes and started screaming, while Sara jumped out from behind the tree. Marko declared he had peed his pants.

They checked their supplies. Jovan showed up in brown shorts and a green leaf-patterned shirt, carrying a military bag. From it, he pulled out a straw hat, put it on his head, plucked a blade of grass from the ground and stuck it in his mouth. Then he put his hands on his hips, stared across at the mountain, and said in a cowboy‚Äôs voice:  
‚ÄúI know these mountains like the back of my hand. Just follow my lead and we‚Äôll reach our destination safely. Watch out for traps ‚Äî this time of year, they‚Äôre hunting us.‚Äù

So they set out on the trail. The temperature was twenty-four degrees, not too hot. After a few minutes of walking, they looked back at the spot where they had been not long ago.  
‚ÄúFeels like it was just yesterday,‚Äù Martin said, pointing at the place they had left five minutes before.

Half an hour later, their stomachs were growling. Marko bent down, plucked a dandelion, and handed it to Jovan.  
‚ÄúHere, chew this until we get to the benches.‚Äù Jovan opened his mouth to say something, but Marko shoved the dandelion into it. Jovan started spitting it out, making everyone laugh.

After another ten minutes, they found a few wooden benches with a table and sunshade along the trail. They sat down and began to eat. As they ate, they talked about new video games they‚Äôd started playing or movies they had recently watched, or at least they thought they were watching. When they were done, they kept going, walking and walking, every now and then saying how tired or hungry they were again, often stopping to admire the beautiful mountain view, the endless clear sky. At one point, because of exhaustion, they all lay down in the grass by the path, and some of them even fell asleep for about ten minutes. After another hour and a half of long, slow walking, they finally reached the top of the mountain. There were a few benches on the edge where those who made it could rest and enjoy what they had accomplished. Sara looked at her watch ‚Äî it was eight o‚Äôclock, and night was slowly starting to fall, so they began heading back.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be easier now since we‚Äôre going downhill,‚Äù said Sara.  
‚ÄúYou know what they say, when you need to get to the parking lot, the fastest way is to jump off a building,‚Äù Marin said with a smirk, watching the others‚Äô reactions. Some laughed, while others looked at him suspiciously.

By now it was already half past eight, and darkness had fully set in. Marko stopped, sighed, and said:  
‚ÄúI want to rest, but I can‚Äôt because I want to get off this mountain as fast as possible. But I can‚Äôt keep going because I‚Äôm tired ‚Äî but if I rest, then it‚Äôll take even longer! What do I dooooooo?!‚Äù Marko shouted, until Jovan slapped him and shook him.  
‚ÄúHold it together! You chose this path yourself, and now you‚Äôre going to walk it,‚Äù Jovan said.  
‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt waaaaaaant to!‚Äù  
‚ÄúThen stay here,‚Äù Jovan replied, letting go of Marko and continuing on. After a few seconds of sulking, Marko started walking again.

As they walked, they noticed something in the distance ‚Äî down in the forest, they could see a light. But it wasn‚Äôt the light of a lamp or a phone, it was the glow of a campfire.  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so strange about that? Some people went into the woods to get out of the house for a while, drink some alcohol, and enjoy nature. So what?‚Äù said Marko, continuing forward while the others stood still, staring at the light below, though they couldn‚Äôt see what was happening.

‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre telling scary stories to spook each other. Let‚Äôs go down and scare them,‚Äù Sara suggested. The others exchanged amused looks and nodded in agreement. As they made their way down the trail, they noticed that the fire had gone out.  
‚ÄúThey probably went to sleep. Even better,‚Äù said Martin, and they kept moving toward the spot where the fire had been. They also started taking shortcuts off the trail to get there faster. At one point, Marko stepped awkwardly while going downhill and twisted his ankle; he grabbed his leg and sat on the ground until the pain eased.

After some time, they reached the area near their destination. They began sneaking through the bushes and the darkness, but when they got close enough to make out what was happening, all four of them froze in place. They couldn‚Äôt see everything, but they could hear the rest. In the dark, they saw three tall figures standing over something. On the ground lay a woman with a child who was crying. The figures were speaking in some strange language, sometimes mixing in words from their own.

‚ÄúJohn, turn on the light,‚Äù said one voice, and a small lamp flicked on. Even with the lamp, they couldn‚Äôt see the faces of those men, because they were wearing black robes with hoods. The robes trailed along the ground as they walked, tied at the waist with a rope to hold them in place. From their voices, they could tell all three were men. One of them was holding a book in one hand while moving the other hand as if casting some kind of spell. They aimed the light at the woman and child on the ground, who were bleeding from several places, such as their arms and legs ‚Äî they had been cut.

Suddenly, the child stood up and tried to run, but one of the men grabbed its arm and yanked it back. The child screamed and cried, but even through the darkness the group could tell the man was smiling. The one holding the child looked at the man with the book and said‚Äî‚ÄúThe child is strong, it should pass through the tunnel,‚Äù said the man with the book. He didn‚Äôt say anything else for a while ‚Äî he stayed silent, thinking. Then the woman turned toward him and shouted through her sobs,

‚ÄúWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!?‚Äù

The man looked at the woman and said:

‚ÄúWhy? Because God spoke to me. He spoke to me, Lukas. He came to me and said, ‚ÄòLukas,‚Äô and I answered, ‚ÄòYes, my Lord?‚Äô There is great sin upon this world. Soon I will send a filter, through which you must lead the people who will follow you. The filter will remove the sinners and leave the pure and innocent. And if you do this, I will reward you and your followers with great happiness. I will speak to you in your dreams, and when you wake I want you to write down my words in a book, a book by which you and your followers will live. If you live by it, you will live very long lives, and great happiness will follow you.‚Äù

When he finished his speech, the woman stared at him in shock. One of the men approached her and struck her in the head, knocking her unconscious. The child screamed before also fainting from the blow.

The village of The New Dawn ‚Äî or as it was once called, The Dawn ‚Äî was founded in 1513. The reasons were fertile land, nearby water sources, and its location in a mountainous area. The tunnel was discovered in 1514 by Adam Bobiƒá, and it was publicly revealed a few months later. The tunnel was described as natural ‚Äî a natural passage through one side of the mountain to the other. Adam wrote about the village, the tunnel, and other matters of that time in several books that anyone could find in a library. While working on his book about the tunnel, Adam disappeared. The book he had been writing was never found, nor was his body. It was believed he had been attacked by wild beasts.

From 1620‚Äì1633, disappearances occurred frequently, mostly children who would go out to play and never return. In 1634, newspapers came out with the headline: ‚ÄúHide your children!‚Äù People were afraid to go outside. Women and children spent most of the day indoors or in their yards, while men worked the fields or went to their jobs. The disappearances stopped completely in 1635.

From 1840‚Äì1844, rails were laid and the tunnel through the mountain was expanded in preparation for the first transport train to pass through the village. In 1845, a train called *Ruby* passed through the village of The Dawn, which was considered a great achievement. The village began to grow and prosper, and in 1847, its name was changed to The New Dawn.",2,1757684966.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1nf3r97,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nf3r97/i_found_a_dead_body_washed_up_on_shore_no_one/,I found a dead body washed up on shore. No one believes me.,"I found the dead man washed up on the beach on my third day at the new job. My first day was almost as bad. They didn‚Äôt want me and they wouldn‚Äôt like me; I knew all of that going in. What I didn‚Äôt expect was getting the silent treatment from every other ranger at the park.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt take it personally, Ranger McCoy,‚Äù the head ranger told me as I closed the door to his office. ‚ÄúEveryone here was just expecting Marco to get the position. He was a great intern.‚Äù

George was middle-aged, with a black beard going gray at the edges. His office was full of old pottery, stone tools, and the top third of an entire wall was devoted to Native American weavings, particularly dreamcatchers, each one larger and stranger than the last.

I nodded toward the dreamcatchers.

‚ÄúAre those local?‚Äù I asked.

George beamed, clearly proud of the collection. ‚ÄúAll of them, yes. Most were made right here on the island.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they old?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of them are darn near ancient.""

I smiled politely. My smile faded when I noticed one large dreamcatcher in the corner. At least, I assumed it was a dreamcatcher; it had the typical spiderweb swirl but instead of being a flat circle, it was three-dimensional, closer to a globe. The material used in the weave appeared unusual as well. It wasn‚Äôt string or twine but more leathery, rough and not at all pleasant to look at.

‚ÄúVery‚Ä¶unique,‚Äù I said ‚ÄúHey, I have a question if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúShoot.‚Äù

I leaned in. ‚ÄúAre the stories about the park true?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich stories?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat the park is haunted. Ghosts in the woods, shadows in the water, and campers going missing now and then. Is any of that-‚Äù

George shook his head. ‚ÄúI know everyone loves a ghost story but the scariest thing you‚Äôll encounter at Snowfall is a pissed off pony.‚Äù He turned his attention to my open resume on his desk. ‚ÄúThis is a pretty solid pedigree here, ranger.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do the ‚Äòsir‚Äô thing here. The team is already inclined not to like you, sorry to say, and if you call me sir, they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre sucking up. You can just call me, George. And please sit down. You‚Äôre making me nervous.‚Äù

I sat. ‚ÄúOkay, George. I‚Äôd rather go by Ashley, then.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, exactly, do you want to work at Snowfall, Ranger McCoy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶don‚Äôt.‚Äù

George raised a bushy eyebrow.

‚ÄúI mean, I don‚Äôt have any issue working here,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to. It seems like a great park and I like being by the ocean. Actually, I used to come here a lot as a kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt want to work here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt request being placed here is what I was trying to say. People here, you know, I‚Äôm sure they probably think that I stole your intern Marco‚Äôs promotion but I had nothing to do with the assignment.‚Äù

The older ranger was silent. He leaned back in his chair. I‚Äôd never seen anyone working so hard to look relaxed and I had no idea why.

George smiled and nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a hard worker and a heck of a ranger. We‚Äôre just a little‚Ä¶unique at Snowfall and, prior to the current superintendent, we kept a lot of say locally in choosing our rangers. Marco was with us for two years between seasonal and probational and all of that. He had a lot of friends here. But they‚Äôre good folks and I know they won‚Äôt hold it against you.‚Äù

But they did.

There were three other full-time rangers other than George at Snowfall. Directly under George was the Assistant Head Ranger Jennifer. She was about the same age as her boss and had a presence I would describe as, ‚Äúmatronly.‚Äù

Gabe was in charge of the camping areas and supervised seasonal rangers in the summer. Other than maybe myself, he was the youngest of the Snowfall Shore group. I doubted he was more than twenty-five, tall and thin and animated when chatting with the other rangers.

Then there was Peter.

While George was polite but distant and Jennifer and Gabe were just distant, Peter radiated hostility.

Other than the collective cold shoulder and George disappearing after our conversation, my first day was uneventful. No one gave me anything to work or a place to work so I spent the day getting familiar with the park and wondering how many years I‚Äôd need to endure at Snowfall before I could fuck off to bigger and better things.

With no assignments or even trainings, I decided to spend my second day exploring the park. There was a spider-web of trails crossing Snowfall centered around half-a-dozen small inlets. I chose a trail at random that ran through the woods near the office and set off on a hike.

My goal was to see one of the infamous Snowfall ghosts. Stories claimed that hundreds of lost souls, many drowning victims from centuries of shipwrecks, wandered the park. When I was a kid, one of my friends told me they‚Äôd personally seen a specter, a faceless woman wailing and stumbling around the north beach at night.

I didn‚Äôt see any ghosts but I did encounter something that made my skin crawl. It was a tiny stick figure shaped like a person hanging from an elm right next to the trail. A tiny scrap of green fishing net was wrapped around the totem‚Äôs head like a mask. The object swung gently from a long piece of twine that was tied around the lowest branch of the tree. I chalked it up to eccentric campers just being weird.

One other moment stood from that trip through the forest. I rounded a bend to find a large rabbit in the middle of the trail. It had black fur and the brightest blue eyes I‚Äôd ever seen. And right in the center of each sapphire eye, a black iris big enough for me to identify even at a distance. The creature stood up when it noticed me, paws in the air. It looked to be nearly the size of a small cat.

‚ÄúUh, hello bunny,‚Äù I said, trying not to startle it. ‚ÄúDo you live around here?‚Äù

The rabbit stood completely still, watching me. Then one sharp ear twitched and it raced away faster than shadows in a basement when you flip the light switch.

‚ÄúBye, bunny,‚Äù I said.

The rabbit‚Äôs blue eyes stayed with me. There was something unnatural about them. The blueness reminded me of the ocean on a clear day, the dark irises like where the water goes from shore-shallow to open deep.

I looked back over the ocean before returning to HQ. For a brief moment, I thought I saw something in the water, a shadow like a fish just under the surface. But the silhouette was too large to be an animal. I decided it was a storm-shadow from one of the clouds above me. Then I turned around and quickly walked toward the office, the rabbit‚Äôs eyes blazing in my memory.

I got back to HQ around lunch time, hurrying at the end because the sky was beginning to look a little dark. The other rangers were gathered around Jennifer‚Äôs desk when I walked in. They were watching the radar. A wall of red was barreling down on the park only a few hours away. For my first official assignment, George tasked me with riding along with Peter to pick up a spare generator from the equipment shed.

Peter didn‚Äôt say a word to me for most of the trip, despite me hammering him with small talk. We passed a small group hiking one of the trails on our way. Two kids and, I assumed, their parents. The foursome waved as we drove by; Peter surprised me by waving back.

‚ÄúFriends of yours?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúRegulars. The Roberts family. They stay here every year. Dad is into fly fishing. Mom is a marine biologist. Nice folks.‚Äù

When we got back to headquarters, George thanked me and then told me to take the rest of the day, as well as the next day, off.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just be doing storm cleanup,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúNo need for the full crew. We‚Äôll see you again the day after tomorrow.‚Äù

I decided on my drive home that, even if I wasn‚Äôt working, I wanted to spend more time getting familiar with the park. So I woke up while it was still dark the next morning, drank three cups of coffee, and headed to Snowfall to explore more of the trails.

I figured I‚Äôd start the day by watching the sunrise. The office parking lot was half-empty when I pulled in, which was strange but I assumed the rangers on-duty were out dealing with storm damage. I left my truck and took a short hike through the wooded area between our headquarters and the nearest slice of beach. The light was gray in the pre-dawn, made worse by the lingering clouds and a light drizzle.

There were little stick-men and stick-women and some that might have been animals, all hanging near the trail. Here and there, the stick figures had those tiny strips of old fishing net covering their faces. Halfway through the hike, I failed to spot roots winding across the path and nearly rolled my ankle.

‚ÄúShit, fuck, ouch.‚Äù

I pulled out my phone and turned the flashlight. When I did, I noticed that I had zero service, despite having full bars back at the office. I remembered George‚Äôs advice about always taking a radio out into the park and considered turning back, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if he meant even when I was off-duty.

‚ÄúIf I break my leg, I‚Äôll just yell super loud,‚Äù I promised myself.

The rest of the trip to the beach was smoother with a light. My only regret was not wearing a better jacket since the rain was picking up. I stepped onto the sand, boots crunching as I rounded the first set of tall dunes. My eyes were on the ocean, a darker shade of gray than the sky above it. Whitecaps grew and broke and grew again while the wind snatched spray from the tips of waves. I could see the water clearly; the highest edge of the sun was already past the horizon.

I shivered against the chill, lost in thought and staring at the seas. There were gulls crying all around me; I didn‚Äôt notice the other birds among them until I saw a large shadow drift across the sand. I looked up to see buzzards coasting among the gulls, heavy and slow with those raw, red heads. Whatever the vultures were circling was just around the next cluster of dunes. I picked up my pace, worried that I‚Äôd find one of the island's famous ponies dead‚Ä¶or dying.

Once I was clear of the dunes, I saw the body.

Three vultures stood hunched next to the corpse. I was too far to be certain but I was pretty sure at first glance that I was seeing a dead man washed ashore. The body was facing the water, dressed in waterlogged clothes that looked like what you‚Äôd find on a lot of day-hikers and campers. As I approached, I heard the dull hum of flies.

A buzzard and half-a-dozen sea gulls took off when I came closer. I stopped twenty feet or so from the body, worried that I might already be disturbing the scene. But I wanted to at least see who the man was. An irrational fear that I might know the victim caused me to move in a wide circle so that I was nearly standing in the water and able to see the man‚Äôs face.

Except there was nothing there. The face was gone, peeled away to reveal bloody muscle and the hint here and there of bone. There were no features left, nothing but an open wound from his hairline down to his jaw.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck.‚Äù I threw up, turning away so it landed in the ocean.

Shaking, I moved away from the corpse, not stopping until I was nearly back to the dunes. I sat in the sand and pulled out my phone, dialing 9-1-1 without taking my eyes off of the body. The vultures and gulls were back, pecking and pulling. The flies had never left.

The call didn‚Äôt connect so I tried again and again. I was breathing heavily when I dialed for a fourth time, almost on the edge of hyperventilation. It was too surreal, like a nightmare that lingered after waking. I kept shooting glances at the dead body, terrified that it might have rolled over while I wasn‚Äôt watching.

Taking a deep breath, I forced my eyes closed and counted to ten. When I opened them, the body was exactly where it had been since I walked onto the beach. I felt myself calming down and realized that my calls weren‚Äôt going to get through. There was zero service on the beach. I‚Äôd have to go back to the office for help.

I took one last look at the body sprawled on the beach then took off running over the dunes. The morning drizzle was turning back into rain by the time I reached the woods between the beach and headquarters. Even though the sun was up, it was darker than before dawn. I stumbled through the forest tripping over roots and rocks. At one point, I almost ran eye-first into one of the little stick-men that was hanging above the trail.

There were a few more trucks in the parking lot when I got back to headquarters. I nearly crashed into Gabe when I ran through the door. I‚Äôd taken the last quarter-mile of the return at a sprint and stood, winded and drenched, trying to convey to Gabe through a series of coughs and gestures that there was a dead body on the north beach.

Jennifer rounded the corner with a cup of coffee and watched me breathlessly pantomiming for a moment. Then she handed me the coffee, forced me to sit down, brought me a towel, and made me dry off and steady my breathing before telling my story.

‚ÄúDead man‚Ä¶north beach‚Ä¶‚Äù I wheezed. ‚Äú...near trailhead‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶he‚Äôs been‚Ä¶mutilated.‚Äù

Gabe‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúMutilated? How?‚Äù

‚ÄúTake your time,‚Äù Jennifer added, passing me another towel. ‚ÄúBreathe.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe body is bloated but fresh. His face is gone. Missing. Removed, I think.‚Äù

Gabe whistled. ‚ÄúFucking crabs around here. Vicious pricks.‚Äù

I shivered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was crabs or vultures or any animal that did it. Everything was too precise, too many straight lines. Too clean.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need another towel?‚Äù Jennifer asked. ‚ÄúOr a blanket?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay. We need to call the police.‚Äù

Jennifer and Gabe exchanged a look.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in DNR‚Äôs jurisdiction,‚Äù Jennifer said, heading for the radio room. ‚ÄúWe should start with the Natural Resource Police. But this storm has them running around all over the island. Let me call George.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, but we need to be out there with the body to make sure the scene isn‚Äôt disturbed.‚Äù

Gabe tilted his head toward the window. The rain had gone from a downpour to a solid wall of water. It lashed the windows and drummed the roof. A gust of wind shook headquarters, filling the building with a sound between a howl and a rasping whistle.

‚ÄúThe scene is already going to be disturbed,‚Äù Gabe said. ‚ÄúNo real reason for us to drown standing out there waiting.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI found him, I‚Äôm staying with him. Come with me or stay here, either‚Äôs fine, just call it in.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust did,‚Äù Jennifer returned with an extra rain parka and radio. She handed me both. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you.‚Äù

Gabe sighed but shrugged on his poncho and grabbed a set of truck keys.

‚ÄúJust let me heat up some fucking coffee for the road and I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Gabe asked.

I raised my voice, trying to speak over the roar of the rain. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äô The body, it was right here.‚Äù

Fifteen minutes after leaving headquarters, the three of us were standing on the beach, using the dunes for a windbreak. It didn‚Äôt help much. The storm was whipping sand and water across the shore while the rain came down nearly sideways. Temperatures were dropping and the sky and ocean were the same violent grey. The corpse I‚Äôd found earlier with its face removed was missing.

Jennifer took a step closer to me, shouting over the wind. ‚ÄúAre you sure this is the spot? Could it be further north?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm positive it was here by the trailhead. Shit. Shit. Why did you need to stop for coffee?‚Äù

Gabe held up his hands. ‚ÄúOne, it's miserable out here and, two, it‚Äôs not like the body got up and walked off the beach.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Ä¶maybe he washed away?‚Äù I guessed, scanning the beach again.

I became aware of a soft rumble getting louder, too quiet and too mechanical to be thunder or the crash of waves. George rounded the corner of the dunes on a four-wheeler, followed a moment later by Peter on another ATV. Both had their parka hoods cinched tight against the wind.

‚ÄúEveryone okay?‚Äù George asked. ‚ÄúWe were up north when we heard the call.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the dream,‚Äù Gabe replied.

I shot him a hard look. ‚ÄúDid you guys see the body? I was sure it would be right here but, uh, maybe I got mixed up in the storm. It‚Äôs close, though, I‚Äôm sure of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo dead folks on the beach between here and Point Bay,‚Äù Peter replied.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll check south for a quarter-mile or so,‚Äù George told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll find it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are?‚Äù Peter asked.

I got ready to snap back but saw George stare Peter down. The younger ranger shifted uncomfortably on his four-wheeler.

‚ÄúOkay, yeah, we‚Äôll find it,‚Äù Peter promised. ‚ÄúHell, I‚Äôve been here nine years and never found so much as a dead tourist in a bath house. You‚Äôre here two days and you already discovered a body on the beach.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people have all the luck, I guess,‚Äù I said but Peter was already driving off, disappearing into the rain and ocean mist.

‚ÄúYou did good,‚Äù George told me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find the scene and then get MRP over here in two shakes.‚Äù

He took off after Peter. I stood watching until both were out of sight. It didn‚Äôt take long. Even their tire tracks in the sand faded under the relentless drag of the wind. In less than a minute, it was like the two rangers had never been there at all.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Jennifer shouted, tugging the arm of my parka. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get back to the truck before we drown.‚Äù

A deep rumble made me look around, expecting to see George or Peter zooming back to tell us they‚Äôd found the body. But this time, the rumble was thunder, followed quickly by a blue-black flash of lightning that connected the ocean and the sky like some bright, skeleton tree. I hurried after Jennifer and Gabe.

We lost power almost as soon as we got back to headquarters. Luckily, the backup generator was easy to get going. Gabe put on a new pot of coffee and the three of us stood looking out the windows at a scene that might have seemed familiar to Noah.

‚ÄúWhat in the Hell kind of spring storm is this?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt almost seems like an early hurricane.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery early,‚Äù Gabe muttered.

Something about the tone of his voice caused me to raise an eyebrow but he just shrugged and handed me a mug of coffee.

‚ÄúYou must have been a barista in a former life,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúSometimes feels like in this life, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we should call DNR now,‚Äù I said, resisting the urge to pace. ‚ÄúGet them over here to help look for the body.‚Äù

Jennifer put a comforting hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure George and Peter have already found it. They‚Äôre probably calling it in already then will head right back. Drink up, Gabe‚Äôs not good for much but he brings in the good coffee from home.‚Äù

I smiled and took a sip. It was pretty good.

‚ÄúI have to bring in my own stuff,‚Äù Gabe said, ‚Äúyou could strip paint with the shit they stock in the breakroom for free. Damn budget cuts.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou spoil us,‚Äù Jennifer teased. ‚ÄúAnd on your own dime.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat can I say, I‚Äôm a giver.‚Äù Gabe put his hand next to his mouth to fake whisper to me. ‚ÄúBut I steal so, so many office supplies to make up the difference. I built my nephew a playhouse just using stacks of Post-Its.‚Äù

I chuckled, smiling for the first time since I‚Äôd found the faceless man. But, again, the memory of the body came back as red and raw as its wounds. The white gulls circling, hard to see against the rain-swollen clouds above them. And the fat, black horseflies buzzing and crawling across the pink muscle of-

A wave of sudden exhaustion made me bend over, causing me to spill my drink.

‚ÄúAshley? Ash, are you okay?‚Äù Jennifer asked, moving next to me.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I just might need to sit for a second.‚Äù

‚ÄúGabe, go grab her a chair. No, not that one, the one from George‚Äôs office. The comfy one. And get her another cup of coffee.‚Äù

George and Peter coasted into the parking lot on their ATVs before I finished my next mug. I stood up immediately, nearly vibrating as the pair fought the wind to get the door open and then closed again.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Peter gasped, peeling off his rain parka and collapsing into the nearest chair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting Biblical out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù I asked, looking between the two. ‚ÄúWhere did you find him?‚Äù

The two rangers shared a look.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I demanded.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we talk in my office?‚Äù George suggested.

‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt imagine a dead body out there this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody is saying that,‚Äù George promised.

Peter cleared his throat but stopped when Jennifer glared.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a dead man out there,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMissing his face?‚Äù Peter asked.

‚ÄúYes. Fucking yes. I know how it sounds but that‚Äôs what I saw.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù George asked. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any doubts at all?‚Äù

‚ÄúNone. Zero. I‚Äôd swear on my life.‚Äù

George sighed and sat down, signaling Jennifer and Gabe to find chairs so we‚Äôd all be seated in a rough circle.

‚ÄúAshley, I want you to know that I believe that you saw something out on the beach.‚Äù

I bristled. ‚ÄúI know what I saw. I saw-‚Äù George held up his hand to finish. ‚ÄúLook, storms like this, no visibility, rain coming down like Heaven sprung a leak-‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt raining like this when I found the body,‚Äù I said, trying to keep a growing tint of anger out of my voice.

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù George admitted, ‚Äútrue. But it was raining. And there was mist, the cold fog that rolls off of the ocean here in the morning. It plays tricks on even us old-timers. Heck, this whole island is a little‚Ä¶weird. Haunted, even. Maybe.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpooky as all get out,‚Äù Gabe agreed.

I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see a ghost. I didn‚Äôt imagine anything. There‚Äôs a dead man out there and if you‚Äôre not calling the police, I will.‚Äù

I got ready to stand up but felt faint again, dropping back into my chair.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Jennifer asked. ‚ÄúYou look tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do,‚Äù George agreed. ‚ÄúThis has been a heck of a morning. Why don‚Äôt you lay down in the breakroom for a bit?‚Äù

My head was swimming. I took a long drink of coffee and rubbed my eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to sleep. Not until I talk to the cops. What channel is NRP on the radio?‚Äù

Peter was watching me. For some reason, I thought he looked curious more than anything.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no good calling,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe natural resource guys and girls are all busy this morning with the storm and looking for the missing camper.‚Äù

‚ÄúMissing camper?‚Äù I asked, stumbling a little over the last word.

I was actually feeling tired. Damn near exhausted.

‚ÄúPeter‚Ä¶‚Äù George said quietly.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, boss, you know she‚Äôs not letting it go.‚Äù Peter gave me a sad smile. ‚ÄúDr. Roberts went missing last night. She wasn‚Äôt at her family‚Äôs campsite this morning. Might have wandered off.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoberts?‚Äù I drawled. It was almost like I was drunk. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶biol‚Ä¶biologist?‚Äù

‚ÄúMarine biologist,‚Äù Peter corrected. ‚ÄúNice lady. It‚Äôs a shame.‚Äù

The room was spinning and the rain sounded far, far away.

‚ÄúSomethin‚Ä¶something not‚Ä¶right,‚Äù I said, using the back of my chair as support while I tried to stand.

The empty coffee mug slipped out of my now numb fingers. Jennifer caught me as I fell.

‚ÄúYou really should have taken George‚Äôs offer and slept today off,‚Äù she said, helping me back to my chair.

‚ÄúShe should have stayed the Hell home,‚Äù Peter muttered. ‚ÄúShe shouldn‚Äôt be here, George. It‚Äôs not right.‚Äù

George was watching me, expressionless. His blue eyes seemed as gray as the ocean in the rain.

‚ÄúComing in on your day off,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs dedication.‚Äù

My last memory in the headquarters before the room went black was George disappearing into his office and several hands laying me gently on the floor.

The universe shook. I woke up feeling like I was drowning. Cold water splashed over my face, and I turned away, only to feel more water. For a panicked moment, I was certain I was drowning. Then something soft, warm, and damp wiped my face.

‚ÄúDo you think that‚Äôs helping?‚Äù I heard Gabe ask. ‚ÄúThe towel is soaked.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust focus on driving and don‚Äôt let us fucking capsize,‚Äù Peter replied.

I opened my eyes, blinking against the rain. My vision was gray at first; as it cleared, I realized it was just the world that was gray. I was half-sitting, half-laying in a small boat rocking in the storm. As I tried to pull myself into a more comfortable position, I found that my arms were handcuffed behind my back and my legs were bound at the ankle.

‚ÄúWhat the fff‚Ä¶‚Äù I slurred, still groggy.

‚ÄúSleeping beauty is awake,‚Äù Gabe said from somewhere behind me.

Peter was kneeling next to me. He leaned over to help me sit up straight but didn‚Äôt say anything. I did my best to get a full look at my surroundings. George was also in the boat, sitting near the bow, staring out across the water. There was a woman slumped behind him. It took me a moment to recognize Dr. Roberts since she was bundled up in a ranger parka but there was no mistaking the blonde hair plastered across her face.

The boat hit a wave and thumped down hard, causing the woman to slide. I realized that she was unconscious.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù I mumbled.

The wind snatched my voice away but Peter understood my look of confusion.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he shouted above the storm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost at the cove. It will be calmer there. You‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

I tried to move, to struggle against the cuffs, but I was so tired. The best I could do was hunch over to keep the worst of the rain out of my eyes. Peter shifted and leaned toward me. The wind and rain let up ever so slightly.

I don‚Äôt remember most of the boat ride. I might have passed out again or maybe there just wasn‚Äôt much to remember other than the rain and the occasional roar of thunder and the endless gray above and below. Eventually, the boat stopped jumping and the wind died down until it was not much more than a heavy breeze. I sat up straight and looked around. Our boat was coasting across calm waters, a smudge of shoreline just visible maybe three- or four-hundred yards away.

‚ÄúThis cove isn‚Äôt on any of the maps,‚Äù George said without turning around.

I was surprised that I could hear him so clearly. The storm was barely above a spring bluster in the cove, though I could still see it raging dark and cold behind us where a break in the beach led back to the open ocean.

‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked, glad to hear my voice was back and the fog was lifting from my mind. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

George turned around and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve ever seen a man in his middle years look so old.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving you a choice, Ashley. A terrible, unforgivable choice, but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs the only one I can offer you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one we knew we‚Äôd need her to make eventually,‚Äù Gabe said.

George leaned back and looked up at the clouds. ‚ÄúTrue. But it should have been years from now. Time when we could have prepared her, made her understand. Shit, remember how long it took you to understand, Peter?‚Äù

Peter didn‚Äôt reply. He was watching me and looked sad.

‚ÄúIt should have been Marco,‚Äù Gabe said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the whole point of the damn internship. Did you ever find out what happened?‚Äù

George turned, searching for something. ‚ÄúHe had a breakdown. Killed himself last night. I just got the call this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù Gabe said, crossing himself. ‚ÄúPoor little guy.‚Äù

Peter closed his eyes.

‚ÄúWhat is happening? Tell me what the Hell is happening,‚Äù I demanded.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to have to,‚Äù George replied.

He stood up and waved twice. I followed his gaze and saw that a second small boat, identical to our own, had anchored about thirty-yards away. Even in the drizzle, I could clearly make out Jennifer sitting in the vessel pointing a rifle at us.

At me, I realized. She‚Äôs pointing that at me.

George sat down. ‚ÄúJenny is just there for insurance but she‚Äôs a crackerjack shot, so please don‚Äôt do anything‚Ä¶sudden.‚Äù I swallowed and stayed quiet. He continued. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to tell you, Ashley, it‚Äôs going to sound, well, it‚Äôs going to sound crazier than a looney bin in an earthquake. But it‚Äôs the truth and I promise you‚Äôll believe me. And I‚Äôm very sorry for that.‚Äù

The Roberts woman was waking up slowly, groaning.

‚ÄúMiss? Dr. Roberts? Can you hear me?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúM‚Äôam, you‚Äôre going to be okay. We‚Äôre fine.‚Äù

George smiled. ‚ÄúGood makings of a ranger. I knew it as soon as I saw you. But, and I‚Äôm eternally sorry for this, only one of you is going to be fine.‚Äù

I felt like I‚Äôd fallen into a tub of ice. I could hear my pulse thumping in my ears and my mouth was suddenly dry.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to hurt anyone,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúWhatever this is, you don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù George agreed. ‚ÄúBut you do.‚Äù

He turned his back to me and began rummaging around in the storage area at the bow. Briefly, I considered throwing myself at him. Maybe I could knock him overboard if I took him by surprise. But I felt Peter shifting next to me, maybe sensing the adrenaline firing through my bloodstream. And then there was Gabe behind me and, of course, Jennifer nearby with her rifle ready. I slumped, realizing that whatever was about to happen, there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do to change it.

George turned around holding two duffle bags. They were olive green, bland, the kind that you could find in any army surplus story in the country. He sat the bags down next to the captive woman.

‚ÄúFirst, I do want you to know, you‚Äôre not at all crazy,‚Äù the old ranger told me. ‚ÄúYou did find a body on the beach this morning. I apologize for lying to you but you weren‚Äôt supposed to see that. The whole reason I gave you off was to keep you away from the park today. Sure is bad luck you came in anyway and worse luck you couldn‚Äôt be talked out of pulling the cops into this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou moved the body?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, me and Pete while the others kept you occupied. We were out looking for the guy, anyway. We knew he‚Äôd be washing up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew? Did you‚Ä¶are you the one who-‚Äù

George nodded. ‚ÄúKilled him? Technically, no, it was Gabe‚Äôs turn, but from a philosophical point of view, we‚Äôre all guilty of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúWe had to. We have to send one down every three or four years.‚Äù George splashed the surface of the water with his fingertips. ‚ÄúIt used to be only once a decade or so when I was younger but she‚Äôs been restless lately.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a thing sleeping under the water here. We think it‚Äôs probably at the bottom of this cove but it might be somewhere deeper. All I‚Äôm sure of is that this little inlet is a special place. The weather‚Äôs always nicer here and this is where she likes her meals.‚Äù

I kept glancing Dr. Roberts. Her eyes were flickering behind closed lids. She‚Äôd be conscious any moment.

‚ÄúWho is, ‚Äòshe?‚Äô‚Äù I asked.

George was staring into the water. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not actually sure she is a ‚Äòshe.‚Äô That‚Äôs just the impression that I got the one time I, uh, communicated with her. You‚Äôll see what I mean.‚Äù

I scooted closer to the head ranger. ‚ÄúListen, whatever this is, the woman is still out cold. Drop her off on the shore. Just let her go.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you want to make that choice quite yet,‚Äù George replied. ‚ÄúThis will be easier if I just show you.‚Äù

He opened the first duffle bag.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been saying just show her from the beginning,‚Äù Gabe said. ‚ÄúRip off the band-aid.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe needed context,‚Äù George countered, pulling a clear plastic box from the bag.

It looked like a shadow box, the large, clear plastic kind you‚Äôd use to display an autographed football or basketball. There was something large and flat inside of the case.

George held it closer. ‚ÄúTake a look, Ashley.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is some kind of insanely tasteless prank, right?‚Äù I asked, glancing around the boat. ‚ÄúOr are you all completely fucking nuts?‚Äù

‚ÄúAshley,‚Äù George repeated, bringing the box closer. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

I did. For a long moment, every thought left my head. Then one came rushing back in and I couldn‚Äôt stop screaming. Inside of the box was a face, pulled taught and hung on thin wires. The eyes and mouth were open holes, the cheeks pale but remarkably life-like. There was even a hint of a five o‚Äôclock shadow on his jaw. Though I‚Äôd never seen the dead man on the beach while he was whole, I was certain I was looking at his well-preserved face.

I turned away to throw up over the side of the boat. Gentle but insistent hands pushed my temples so that I was facing the box again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Peter said. ‚ÄúBut you have to see all of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No.‚Äù I jammed my eyes shut.

George sighed. ‚ÄúEither open your eyes or I‚Äôm going to have to push Dr. Roberts into the water.‚Äù

Whimpering, I slowly opened my eyes to look at the face.

It was moving.

I stared, unable to understand what was happening. The dead man's mouth was opening and shaking while his face convulsed. It was as if he was silently screaming.

‚ÄúJesus. God,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúWhat? How?‚Äù

George, thankfully, returned the box to the duffle bag. ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm sure you guessed, that belongs to the fella you found this morning. It was sitting still as a picture up until yesterday afternoon when it all of a sudden started‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶you saw. That‚Äôs one of the signs that she‚Äôs waking up. When we send one down to her, we‚Äôre supposed to keep the faces. It‚Äôs sick but those are just the rules that got passed down. The face acts as a warning that the bitch is restless. That and the storm. Then it‚Äôs time for a new sacrifice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is evil,‚Äù I said.

George nodded. ‚ÄúMaybe. But what we do here at Snowfall, it goes back a long time, Ashley. Like, before this was a park, before there was a town. Even before the first Europeans built a couple of stick sheds and called it a colony, the local tribes were sending down sacrifices to keep this thing sleeping. One life every few years might be evil but the last time something like her woke up, I understand a whole colony disappeared in North Carolina. This thing is ancient, Ashley. And it only tolerates us as long as we keep it fed and dreaming satisfied dreams.""

A sudden, mad panic made me try to rip my hands through my cuffs. To Hell with the bastards and Jennifer and her rifle. I would not let them skin me alive and throw me into the ocean.

‚ÄúEasy,‚Äù Peter said, pinning my arms. ‚ÄúEasy. I know. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry. But everything he‚Äôs saying is true.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all fucking crazy,‚Äù I screamed, feeling like I was losing a grip on my own sanity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick. There‚Äôs nothing down there. You‚Äôre just murderers.‚Äù

George opened the second duffle bag. ‚ÄúI was hoping the face would be enough to convince you but I understand it‚Äôs a lot to take in.‚Äù He pulled out a device made of sticks and what looked like strips of leather. I recognized it as the strange dreamcatcher from his office. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about this part,‚Äù George said, placing the object over my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about all of this but this in particular.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you-‚Äù

The netting came down until my head was covered. Instantly, I knew I wasn‚Äôt on the boat anymore. I was standing on a wide, black beach at night. The sky was clear but discolored, like a fresh bruise slowly going purple. There was a full moon hanging above the horizon but it was wrong, too. It was far too large and seemed so close I was worried it would fall into the ocean. There was only one star; a bright red one that I couldn‚Äôt look at for long. It was like a wound just before it began to bleed.

I shivered and crossed my arms. My cuffs were gone and my legs were also free. It was cold, colder than anything I‚Äôd ever felt before. Despite the clear conditions, the ocean was rough. Whitecaps stood and hung and crashed down, breaking at the shoreline.

There was something in the water. Many things.

People.

Each was missing their face but somehow all of them were screaming, clawing at the blank flesh where their faces should be. The sound was horrible, a muffled gurgle that was amplified to a buzzing wind by the hundreds or thousands of throats that were trying to shriek. A large wave pushed a dozen of the naked, squirming figures onto the beach. Most were stunned but a few tried to crawl away. Before they could, a human hand the size of a small parking lot emerged from the water and raked the sand with fingers like huge, crooked trees.

The miserable things were dragged back into the tide. Another gigantic hand was rising from the ocean, then a second, and a third. They towered above me, blocking out the light of the swollen moon. I screamed-

\-and kept screaming as someone pulled the dreamcatcher from my head and shook me.

‚ÄúAshley, Ash.‚Äù Peter‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I know it‚Äôs awful but you‚Äôre safe. You‚Äôre not there. You‚Äôre not there.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù Gabe said.

I opened my eyes to see Peter glaring at the other ranger. Gabe was looking out over the calm waters, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. He flicked his lighter and cupped his hands but couldn‚Äôt get it going in the drizzle. Sighing, Gabe tossed the cigarette into the ocean.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt litter,‚Äù George said, putting the twisted dreamcatcher back into the bag. ‚ÄúYou saw the beach, right?‚Äù

I was shaking uncontrollably, unable to answer. My screaming had woken Dr. Roberts. She was looking around the boat, confused but growing more afraid by the moment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this? Where?‚Äù she mumbled. ‚ÄúDan? Dan‚Ä¶the kids‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what you saw,‚Äù George said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all seen it, too. This cove‚Ä¶I guess it‚Äôs like a window, or better yet, a doorway, to wherever fucked up place she calls home. We send her food but not just to eat. She keeps them forever, she feeds on their pain and their minds and their memories. An ocean of screaming. Hell of a lullaby.

""Remember I said that I‚Äôd need you to make a choice, Ashley? Now is the time. We do a terrible but necessary thing here. You weren‚Äôt supposed to discover it so soon but the cat‚Äôs out of the bag. So now we all need to know you really have what it takes to be a park ranger at Snowfall.‚Äù

I shifted my gaze from George to the camper handcuffed next to him.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo. No. No.‚Äù

The old ranger held up his hands. ‚ÄúThat is one of the answers you can give but I strongly suggest you take a moment to consider your situation. No matter what happens, the doctor here will be sent down. There‚Äôs no way around that. You only get to decide if you are going to be the one to send her‚Ä¶or if you‚Äôre going down with her. I‚Äôll give you two minutes to decide.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is going on? Let me go,‚Äù the camper mumbled in a haze.

George slipped a gag between her teeth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry doc but the ritual requires you to be awake. Bad, bad luck. Try to put your mind in a happier place.‚Äù

‚ÄúAshley,‚Äù Peter said, leaning down to put his face close to mine. ‚ÄúYou have to do this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt, you see where you‚Äôll be going.‚Äù

I started sobbing, nearly hyperventilating, but he was right. The only thing I could imagine being worse than killing that poor woman was going into the water with her. So when George told me my time was up and he offered me a bone-handled knife, I took it with the one hand they let free. Gabe and George dragged Dr. Roberts close to me and forced her head still while Peter kept one hand on my wrist just in case I tried to stab one of them or myself.

George told me what to do, where to cut, and Peter helped counter the shaking in my hand. Even with the gag, I‚Äôll never, until the day I die, forget the sound the camper made while I worked at her face. It‚Äôs a sound I hear in my nightmares now, along with the buzz of flies, and a wind that moans.

When I was done, George placed the dreamcatcher over her head. Gabe and Peter tossed her, still screaming, over the side of the boat. As soon as she hit the water, the remains of the storm began to clear. By the time we made it back to headquarters, the sun was shining brightly and the air smelled like it had the edge of summer on it, clean and warm.

No one spoke a word the entire trip back. They let me loose from my bonds. Gabe even offered me a cigarette. Peter had to light it for me; I was shaking too badly to use the lighter. He also helped me collapse into a chair when we were back in the office and brought me a blanket. George brought me a mug of tea that smelled like honeysuckle and citrus. I eyed the cup suspiciously.

George laughed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, nothing in your drink this time. No need. [Welcome to the team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grand_Theft_Motto/comments/1nf3siz/story_notes_the_body_tide/)‚Äù",5,1757684945.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

My work is demanding a lot of social ressources (which I freaking love) but I feel the need to be more awaken during my working hours, that‚Äôs were extra caffeine takes place.

He told me this is a drug behavior/addiction and I was shocked to hear that, as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in an addiction behavior.
But on the other hand, he told last month that some people could take caffeine with methylphenidate, as everyone is reacting differently to medication‚Ä¶ his words.

Do you take caffeine even if you took medicine?
Do you think taking extra caffeine would suggest something bad I‚Äôm not aware of?

I decided to get practical and spent weeks jumping between five different services. Here‚Äôs what actually worked for me and where each one stands for an [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/).

* * *

### **1\.** [**XXIPTV**](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_BEST/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (better rates for longer plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent for US and UK sports, solid Canadian and French options)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (even during US primetime or Champions League nights, barely a hiccup)
    
*   **My take:** I first heard about XXIPTV from a UK-based **iptv reseller**. It‚Äôs honestly the most reliable I‚Äôve tried‚ÄîUS news, UK football, Canadian hockey, and French films all ran smoothly. Plus, their [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_provider/wiki/index/) was genuinely useful for testing on my devices.
    

* * *

### **2\.** [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (discounted with multi-month [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestredditIPTV/wiki/index/))
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (massive selection for US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (steady for most things, just the occasional buffer during big live events)
    
*   **My take:** A friend in Canada tipped me off to IPTVMEZZY. I was impressed with their range, especially for French and UK content. There were a couple of brief slowdowns during major hockey games, but nothing deal-breaking. Setup was easy and support was responsive.
    

* * *

### **3\.** [**Aurorastreaming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Streaming_SUB/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (great for UK and FR, solid US/CA picks)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (most days are smooth, but live UK sports sometimes need a refresh)
    
*   **My take:** Aurorastreaming was a bit of an underdog for me. Their VOD selection is a hidden gem, especially if you like French or British classics. I did notice some lag during a UK rugby final, but otherwise, it‚Äôs a strong all-rounder.
    

* * *

### **4\.** [**BlueSky Streams**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Streaming_SUB/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 24,000+ live, 77,000+ VOD (US/UK/CA focused, fewer FR special interest channels)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (news and movies are fine, but sports can lag at peak times)
    
*   **My take:** BlueSky Streams is an easy pick for everyday viewing‚Äîthink US late shows, UK drama, and Canadian news. French content is more limited, but still present. Their sign-up process for **iptv subscription 2025** is simple and beginner-friendly.
    

* * *

### **5\. StreamPort IPTV**

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 50,000+ VOD (US/UK core, some CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (more buffering during evenings and live sports, but okay for casual viewing)
    
*   **My take:** This is the ‚Äúit gets the job done‚Äù option. Not the widest lineup, but it covers the basics. The **iptv reseller** dashboard is straightforward if you‚Äôre curious about dabbling in that, but I mostly used it for background TV and catching up on older Canadian shows.
    

* * *

**IPTV Lessons Learned in 2025**
--------------------------------

*   **Always go for the best iptv trial**‚Äînothing beats testing with your own devices and network.
    
*   Don‚Äôt be swayed by the biggest channel numbers. Focus on what you‚Äôll actually watch (for me: UK quiz shows, US news, and the occasional French film).
    
*   Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) providers have off nights, especially when everyone‚Äôs watching that big game.
    
*   If you‚Äôre thinking about becoming an [**iptv reseller**](http://aurorastreaming.online/), be ready for lots of ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt my stream working?‚Äù texts.

When a coffee machine promises precise temperature control and offers multiple brewing modes, my caffeine enthusiast brain immediately charges into test mode. I‚Äôve been using this machine tirelessly, from morning rituals to late work nights, and there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here. The brushed stainless steel exterior exudes a premium feel, complementing my modern kitchen aesthetic beautifully. 

**Programmable Features and Brewing Modes**  
The sheer versatility of the programmability on this machine amazed me. Six presets, including the Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew modes, mean there‚Äôs something for every taste and occasion. The level of customization offered on the My Brew mode is outrageous ‚Äì tweaking bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate easily tailors every cup just the way I want it. As someone who usually flips between iced coffee in summer and steaming hot brews in winter, this coffee maker delivered to perfection.  

[Ready to buy Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://maisea.com/p/b078rqvqf1/)  

**Thermo Coil Heating System and Advanced Temperature Control**  
Precise temperature control and a thermo coil heating system are standout features. Unlike typical brewing systems using aluminum, the water here feels purer, possibly affecting the brew flavor positively. I zealously tested it across various coffee brands and roast levels‚Äîspoiler‚Äîit never disappointed. Even when opting for the automatic Gold preset mode, it maintained brewing standards that coffee perfectionists swear by. 

**Dual Filter Baskets and Steep-and-Release Functionality**  
I couldn‚Äôt overlook the practicality of dual filter baskets. You get the option between the flat bottom or cone filters, allowing you to brew anywhere from a small single-serving cup to a large carafe‚Äîideal for unpredictable situations like friends dropping by. The patented Steep & Release technology fully utilizes the brew for smaller portions when the carafe isn‚Äôt present. This was incredibly handy during mornings when I scarfed down just one cup before dashing out.  

**Advantages**  
The list of strong points is impressive, but I‚Äôll summarize with these highlights:  
- Six customizable brewing modes that satisfy a range of preferences.  
- The precision-focused heating and PID temperature control system elevate flavor extraction.  
- Dual filter baskets accommodate both single cups and family-sized servings seamlessly.  
- Addition of the pour-over compatibility, for those who love experimenting.  

**Disadvantages**  
As much as I‚Äôm a fan, this machine isn‚Äôt without its flaws. Here are some caveats I encountered:  
- It is slightly bulky, so if counter space is a luxury in your kitchen, it‚Äôs worth measuring.  
- The thermal carafe, while effective at heat retention, doesn‚Äôt pour as efficiently as I‚Äôd hoped‚Äîit tends to dribble occasionally.  
- After prolonged use, cleaning each component carefully can feel a bit tedious.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this coffee maker to some competing brands reveals much. For instance, the Technivorm Moccamaster offers impressive durability and simplicity, but it lacks the advanced programmability and variety of brew modes the Breville delivers. On the flip side, the Cuisinart CPO-850 may be more budget-friendly, though it doesn‚Äôt quite offer the same level of precision or versatility as the Breville Precision Brewer. The functionality to adjust bloom times and flow rates with this product really sets it apart in competitive testing.  

**True Value**  
Discussing the value for money, this machine undeniably falls into a premium pricing category, which may not appeal to budget-conscious buyers. However, the unmatched flexibility, robust build quality, and technical brewing features undoubtedly make it a worthy investment for those passionate about exploring coffee nuances. It‚Äôs not just a machine; it feels more like a coffee lab for the home barista.

I blindly bought perfumes from Blur India after reading glowing reviews. Originally a cosmetics brand, Blur has now ventured into perfumes with a refreshing approach. The playful and fun packaging instantly caught my eye‚Äîsomething often missing in the affordable, made-in-India perfume space. I picked three variants‚ÄîCookie Crumble, Vanilla Melts, and Cherry Tart‚Äîpriced around ‚Çπ450 each.

Vanilla Melts is sweet with a musky base and lasts 6‚Äì7 hours. Inspired by Kayali Vanilla 28, it‚Äôs a lovely feminine fragrance.

Cookie Crumble opens with floral notes and settles into a soft vanilla accord, offering a unique and original scent perfect for daily wear.

Cherry Tart has a bold, seductive cherry scent with sweetness that makes it unforgettable.

These perfumes deliver excellent performance and value, making them a fantastic blind buy for affordable luxury!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Desi Fem Frag Subreddit**

I bought five perfumes from Blur India on a blind buy and was thoroughly impressed. The packaging, while affordable, looks charming and has a premium feel that sets it apart in this price range. The bottles are beautifully designed, and even the smallest details, like the decorative rings, add character and charm.

Cherry Tart offers a delightful cherry fragrance with just the right balance, making it both playful and elegant.

Vanilla Melts is a soft vanilla scent with subtle layers that evolve over time, adding depth and warmth.

Peach Sorbet presents a vibrant, fruity aroma that‚Äôs fresh and bright without being overpowering.

Coffee Cake and Cookie Crumble both offer comforting gourmand notes that are cozy and inviting.

With a performance that lingers gently and packaging that‚Äôs both cute and travel-friendly, this collection is a fantastic introduction to affordable Indian perfumes!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Brown Beauty Subreddit**

I recently picked up Blur India perfumes during a sale after reading positive reviews, and I‚Äôm glad I did! The packaging is adorable, and the perfumes are incredibly affordable. It‚Äôs exciting to see new Indian brands offering such well-crafted scents.

Cookie Crumble is a beautifully floral fragrance that settles into soft vanilla notes. It feels familiar yet unique and lasts well over six hours.

Vanilla Melts has quickly become my favorite vanilla fragrance. A brief period of maceration enhances its sweet opening and smooth musky finish. The fragrance matures beautifully and stays with me throughout the day.

Coffee Cake smells remarkably similar to Kamrah Qahwa, making it a perfect dupe for those seeking something familiar yet affordable.

These perfumes are a delightful find with travel-friendly bottles and a charming presentation‚Äîhighly recommended for fragrance lovers!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Indian Beauty Yappers Subreddit**

Here‚Äôs my review of Blur India perfumes, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Since they‚Äôre very affordable, I chose scents that matched my vibe, knowing that they‚Äôd still be perfect even if I used them as room fresheners.

The bottles feel surprisingly heavy for the price, and the included charms add a playful touch. I tested Cookie Crumble and Vanilla Melts, and both exceeded my expectations.

Cookie Crumble is my favorite‚Äîit opens fresh with floral notes and blends seamlessly into a soft vanilla accord, lasting around seven hours without any sharpness.

Vanilla Melts is a subtle, less sweet vanilla inspired by Kayali Vanilla. It matures beautifully after a few weeks and gains depth with time, making it a sophisticated choice.

These perfumes are worth a blind buy for anyone searching for affordable yet elegant fragrances. Their customer service was impressive as well, quickly resolving a missing charm issue, which further boosted my experience!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Beauty Addiction Subreddit**

I recently did a blind buy of Blur India‚Äôs *Smells Like Breakfast In Bed* perfumes, and I‚Äôm thrilled with the results!

Vanilla Melts is a perfectly balanced gourmand fragrance‚Äîsweet but not overpowering‚Äîwith woody and musky notes that enhance the vanilla. It lasts around 6‚Äì7 hours with a pleasant projection and eventually settles into a comforting hazelnut scent.

Cookie Crumble truly surprised me. It‚Äôs an original floral and vanilla blend that feels refreshing and unique, rather than duplicating other fragrances. It‚Äôs quickly become my favorite, offering elegance and warmth without being overly familiar.

These perfumes have a wonderful vibe, affordable pricing starting at ‚Çπ450, and a premium look and feel. I highly recommend blind buying *Cookie Crumble*‚Äîit‚Äôs a delightful addition to any fragrance collection and a standout in this price range!

1nf3ezd,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1nf3ezd/thank_you_to_this_group/,THANK YOU to this group,"I just did my 4th 2.5mg dose, and while I am down just 4.5 pounds in 3 weeks (SW 190 CW 186 GW 150), I know slow and steady is the key. This forum has been my go-to while deciding to do this, where to order from, what to do about side effects, and mostly encouragement with all your stories! Thank you for your honesty and support. My first month was ordered from CitizenMeds, and the price was just okay. I just received a starter pack from Lumi. Received cold 10 days after order.  
  
For someone brand new, here is what I learned my first month:  
  
My first dose was in my stomach at 9am and by 5 pm I was very nauseous through most of the night with a wicked headache. I had not had enough protein that morning and I think that was not good. Second dose was the following week, 6.5 days later, at 2pm in my thigh after heavy protein all day and lots of H2O. No nausea! I take a 550mg Ginger Root a couple hours before. Did have a slight headache in the morning. No constipation at all - I eat 3-4 prunes each evening. My third dose I chose the other thigh and so far, so good with same effect. Same for dose 4. My intention is to go up to 3mg in week 5 and stay for a month, then see if I need to increase by .5/mo additional. I'd like to stay no higher than 5mg max if it is effective. We'll see. I may try back to my stomach if I stall.  
  
I am tracking all my food/drink on My Fitness Pal and it has changed my relationship to food. I am not craving things like sugar (which I could previously binge) and have only had a few cocktails/wine with no side effects (I was a 2 glass/day girl prior) My calories avg 1100-1200/day with 75g protein and 65+oz of H2O. I enjoy the food I eat (no aversion) and can eat small amounts. Using a small bowl/plate makes a difference. A post today inspired me to have a free day once a week to have higher calories which is good for metabolism.  
  
I was pretty sedentary and I am walking 1.5+ miles 2-3 x wk and doing 5lb weights a couple x week also.  
  
Protein was lacking prior to this as I am a bread, pasta, wine & cheese girl! I use pea protein, Greek yogurt, and frozen raspberries and 1/3 banana for a smoothie in the morning and collagen protein in my coffee to have 40+g protein by 10 am. Game changer for me.    
  
My (naturally slim, fit) partner is an incredible cook and baker, which made it hard to stay away from bread/sauces/pies he makes, but he has been incredibly supportive and tailors some meals to accommodate my journey. In the past, I have only lost weight while single lol  
  
I have used phentermine (lost 40#) HCG (lost 40#), Keto (lost 15#), and other herbal supplements for decades, each time gaining back the weight when I went off them. HCG was the last one 15 years ago and I gained back about 25 or the 40 pounds (through menopause) and have pretty much maintained my SW for the past several years. This feels different. I am changing how I approach food and drink and exercise, and this time it is all about health for me. In the past, I wanted to look good. Now I want to feel good and live healthy and strong. As I approach 65, that matters most.    
  
I wish you all well on your journey and I am so grateful for this community. Thank you all!",17,1757684091.0,tirzepatidecompound,2,1.0,False

I actually work in one of those office towers in a pool of people that keep in their cliques.

I'm normally downtown around 7:30am, a while before I actually start work so it's a good situation to meet me at a few of the coffee places to pick up a brew, and chat some, before we need to to into work. We can also do this for lunch, afternoon walk breaks and maybe the odd after work drink too, 

Not looking for big adventures, I need an excuse to get away from my desk and clear my mind.

Saturday mornings, coffee on the fender, torque specs in my brain, it‚Äôs my version of meditation. I‚Äôm not chasing lap records or flexing horsepower; I‚Äôm chasing that quiet click when a bolt lands home, the smell of fresh oil, the satisfaction of solving a small rattle that only I could hear.



Over time, ‚Äúwrench therapy‚Äù changed more than my car. It reshaped how I approach stress and setbacks. When life throws a misfire, I diagnose instead of panic: isolate the symptom, check the basics, work step by step. It also made me more patient. Parts don‚Äôt arrive overnight; seized bolts don‚Äôt free themselves. You learn to soak, wait, try again.



I‚Äôve built small rituals that keep it healthy and safe:



**Lists > impulse**: I keep a running note of maintenance and cosmetic ‚Äúnice-to-haves,‚Äù so I don‚Äôt overspend.



**One upgrade in, one habit added:** New pads? Commit to monthly brake checks. New tires? Commit to regular pressure/rotation.



**Budget boundaries:** Consumables first (fluids, filters, brakes), fun stuff second.



**Respect the limits:** If a job requires specialized tools or has safety implications, I get a pro.



**Curious about your rituals:** Do you wrench? What‚Äôs your favorite garage win? What tool felt like a cheat code (for me: a proper torque wrench and flare-nut wrenches)? And if you don‚Äôt DIY, what routines help you feel connected to your car detailing days, preventative checks, or just a dedicated Sunday drive?



**Safety note:** follow manuals/torque specs, use jack stands on level ground, and know when to consult a professional.",1,1757684029.0,BalanceAndDrive,0,1.0,False

Here are 7 free insights (extracted from a 45-page guide, 200+ captions, and AI prompt libraries):

1. **Beauty brands** get much higher engagement when captions mix *self-love* with product tips ‚Üí engagement doubled compared to plain promotional posts.
2. **Coffee shops** that use emojis like ‚òï‚ú® in captions often see *up to 3x more comments*.
3. **Fashion posts** that show ‚ÄúHow to style your outfit‚Äù carousels consistently outperform ‚ÄúNew arrivals‚Äù posts ‚Üí people are more likely to save educational content.
4. **Fitness content** works best with short motivational CTAs (‚ÄúOne more rep üí™‚Äù) instead of long texts ‚Üí share rate increases.
5. **Real estate companies** using AI prompts to create 5-slide ‚Äúfirst-time buyer tips‚Äù carousels doubled their saves and inquiries.
6. **Restaurant posts** showing *behind-the-scenes cooking* consistently outperform menu photos ‚Üí storytelling drives appetite and engagement.
7. Across all niches, **consistency beats perfection** ‚Üí simple Canva templates + regular posting = better results than waiting for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù post.

Have you ever had the model just‚Ä¶stop working in the middle of a task? Yeah, that happened to us a few too many times.

There we were, working on parsing quite an extensive dataset and continuing on a long chat, midway through a critical analysis when GPT timed out. Killed the progress and left us scrambling. Hours of context and prompting vanished in an instant. And then there came that moment of panic: ‚ÄúDo we remember how to do this without AI? Or start over with another model?""

We did something better. We set up a fallback system that automatically jumps to the backup model of your choice. OpenAI ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí whatever‚Äôs next in line.

Now when one model decides to take a coffee break, you can hop to the next one using nexos.ai. We know this can save many from a few additional grey hairs, you know?

Plus, it works not only when the model crashes, but also when response times are slow.

1nf38kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nf38kv/castenada_part_15/,Castenada (Part 15),"I hadn‚Äôt told Blu yet, but I recognized the skeletons in the cave. I didn‚Äôt want to freak her out. Since yesterday, when I booted up that floppy disk, I had been experiencing brief glimpses and fragments. They didn‚Äôt make much sense to me and I largely ignored them initially. But when I saw those remains, it all came flooding back to me. I remembered being *him*. The Marine. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it‚Äôs kind of like the sensation of remembering a memory that isn‚Äôt yours. Memories are supposed to be rooted in the linear sequence of days you‚Äôve actually lived to use as a reference point. These weren‚Äôt like that. They came in detached from any timeline I could place, unprompted.

And this wasn't just him. Last night, I saw everything through Blu‚Äôs eyes somehow while still consciously aware of my own experience. When we were in her room, I felt her lips on mine twice. Once from my perspective and once from hers. The two versions of the moments melded over each other and it was impossible to determine who I was. It made me wonder if memory is only a matter of perspective since we think of memories as proof of who we are. But if I can remember being her as much as myself, then what am I remembering exactly? Me, or us?

I woke before she did. It was still early in the morning. Her face was half-buried in the pillow, hair spilled over the sheets. I laid there for a while trying not to move. The room was silent except for her quiet snoring and the low hum of the heater in the corner. I looked around at all the paintings in the room and wondered if she was having a dream about one of those horrors right now. Several dozen minutes passed before I slipped carefully out of the bed. The floor creaked in places, but thankfully, Blu didn‚Äôt stir. I exited the room and eased the door behind me. I padded towards the kitchen. I was surprised to find Blu‚Äôs grandmother sitting at the dining table with a cup of coffee in front of her. ‚ÄúYou must be a friend of Blu‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, something like that.‚Äù

She gave the faintest smile, more in her eyes than her lips. ‚ÄúNot many of Blu‚Äôs friends spend the night. You two must be close.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond to this and just offered an awkward laugh.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve known who she is for a long time. She doesn‚Äôt need to tell me and you don‚Äôt need to tell me either.‚Äù She stood up and went to pour a second cup of coffee for me. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name, child?‚Äù

‚ÄúJezebel. You‚Äôre Blu‚Äôs grandma?‚Äù I pulled out the chair across from her and sat down.

She set the steaming mug in front of me and sat back down with a sigh. ‚ÄúYes, I am. You can call me K√°la.‚Äù

I cupped the mug in both hands, unsure what to say next. The coffee was strong and bitter.

K√°la watched me for a moment. ‚ÄúYou look tired.‚Äù

I tried to smile. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt get much sleep.‚Äù

She sipped her coffee. ‚ÄúSleep isn‚Äôt always rest. Sometimes it gives you more to carry.‚Äù

We sat for a moment in silence. The early light slanted weakly through the kitchen window, softening against the film of condensation on the glass. The yard was littered with damp leaves, flattened and darkened to the color of worn leather.

After I finished my cup of coffee, I found myself sitting outside on the porch. A little while later, the screen door clicked open behind me. Blu stepped out barefoot, her hair still tangled from sleep, with a pack of cigarettes in hand. She slid down beside me, shoulder brushing mine. She cupped her hand around her lighter‚Äôs flame. When the end of her cigarette caught, she inhaled and smoke curled out between her lips, drifting in lazy ribbons.

I broke the silence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should go to the police.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Blu tapped ash off the end of her cigarette.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll just tell us to stay out of the cave. Rope it off, maybe. And even if they didn‚Äôt, how do we explain it? They‚Äôll think we‚Äôre making it up.‚Äù

Blu snorted. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs fair. Bonney already thinks you‚Äôre crazy.‚Äù She took another drag. ‚ÄúSo if the cops are out, then it‚Äôs just us. We could go back. Not today, maybe not even tomorrow, but soon. Take our time this time. Bring gear, cameras, maybe even weapons or something. Better than running the second shit gets weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanna go *back*?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat Aubrey girl‚Äôs still missing. That‚Äôs how you found the cave, right? You don‚Äôt know anymore about the floppy disk than you did. Plus, that thing is still down there just waiting for whoever stumbles in next.‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should tell her about what I had experienced last night.

She put her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just you and me, Jez.‚Äù She shot me a reassuring smile. ‚ÄúLook, I know a guy in Elk Grove. Acquaintance from way back in high school. I can probably get us a gun, maybe two.‚Äù

‚ÄúA *gun*? Do you hear yourself right now?‚Äù

She tapped ash onto the step. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying we go full Rambo. I‚Äôm just saying if something comes at us in there, I‚Äôd rather not be helpless.‚Äù

I really wanted to shut this down. It was insane enough to want to go back, let alone be armed like vigilantes. ‚ÄúFine. If you really think it‚Äôll make a difference, we‚Äôll get one. But just one.‚Äù

Blu smirked, flicking her cigarette butt into the damp leaves. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl. I‚Äôll drive.‚Äù


_____________________________________________

The drive into Elk Grove took us past the Lucky Star and out toward the sprawl of trailers pressed into a patch of woods just off the main road. Most of the trailers had their aluminum siding sun-bleached to a dull gray, streaked with rust. Christmas lights still clung to a few porches even though it was October, their bulbs burned out or flickering weakly. A couple of kids in oversized flannels kicked around a deflated basketball.

‚ÄúThat one,‚Äù Blu said, nodding toward a narrow single-wide. There was a faded *Coors Light* banner draped across the window like it had been there since last Autumn. The steps leading up to the door were nothing more than stacked cinder blocks. Blu parked her Tacoma right beside it. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ let me do the talking, alright?‚Äù

I climbed out reluctantly. The gravel crunched under our shoes as we crossed toward the door. A dog barked from somewhere deeper in the park. Blu hopped up the steps and knocked twice on the metal door. I hung back a little, hands shoved in my jean pockets, eyeing the beer cans scattered in the weeds by the skirting.

The door groaned as it swung inward. A man around our age leaned against the frame, greasy hair and thinning at the crown. He wore a black shirt that read *I Got My Dick Sucked In A Haunted House* with the sleeves cut off unevenly, curling at the edges.

Blu nodded to his shirt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the story behind that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBehind what?‚Äù He looked genuinely confused.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Nevermind.‚Äù

He started fingering his belly button. ‚ÄúLooking for more chronic?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here for weed, Brandon. We need something else.‚Äù

Brandon squinted. ‚ÄúSomething else, huh?‚Äù He mulled it over for a moment. ‚ÄúAlright, come on in.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome to my office, ladies.‚Äù The place smelled like smoke, stale beer, and the faint sourness of old pizza boxes stacked in the corner. Posters for *Terminator 2* and Metallica‚Äôs *‚Ä¶And Justice For All* were taped crookedly on the wall. A stack of VHS tapes leaned precariously against a tube TV. On the coffee table, there was a magazine in bold, red letters that read *‚ÄúFINGERS‚Äù.* Brandon dropped into the sagging couch. ‚ÄúSo, if it ain‚Äôt weed, what are you after?‚Äù

Blu stayed standing, one hip cocked. ‚ÄúWe need a piece.‚Äù

His grin faltered for a second. ‚ÄúJesus, Blu. You in some kind of trouble?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe just need protection. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

Brandon leaned back into the couch, springs groaning under his weight. ‚Äú*Protection.* That‚Äôs a funny way of putting it.‚Äù Then, with a sigh, he shoved himself up to his feet. ‚ÄúHang on.‚Äù He disappeared elsewhere in the trailer. A minute later, Brandon returned carrying a shoebox under his arm. He brushed aside a few empty cans on the coffee table and set it down, opening the lid. Inside, wrapped in a ragged Guns N‚Äô Roses t-shirt, was a revolver. ‚Äú.38 special. Not much, but it‚Äôll do the job if you‚Äôre not picky. Ain‚Äôt a charity, though. What‚Äôs it worth to you?‚Äù

‚Äú*Bullshit.* You and I both know you didn‚Äôt pay shit for it. You‚Äôre sitting on it because you like to show it off, not because you‚Äôre gonna use it. Hand it over.‚Äù

Brandon squinted at her and was taken aback for a moment. Then he let out a laugh that cracked into a cough. ‚ÄúGoddamn, Blu. Fine. Take the damn thing. Consider it‚Ä¶ a friendly donation.‚Äù

Blu scooped up the revolver and started tucking it into her pants. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny, I didn‚Äôt know we were friends.‚Äù Brandon‚Äôs eyes lingered on Blu‚Äôs waistband, then flicked to me, winking. *Gross.*

Blu adjusted her jacket and turned toward the door without another word. I followed quickly behind her. As we stepped down the cinderblock steps, Brandon called after us. ‚ÄúHey, Blu, you should bring your friend around here more often.‚Äù

We climbed back into the Tacoma. Blu fired up the engine and started driving us out of Elk Grove. I stared at her for a moment before blurting, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me you smoke pot? Haven‚Äôt you seen the commercials? The whole ‚Äòthis is your brain on drugs‚Äô thing?‚Äù

Blu snorted and shook her head. ‚ÄúJesus, Jez. You actually buy into that? That‚Äôs some D.A.R.E. program bullshit.‚Äù

I crossed my arms, slumping into the seat as the trailer park slipped away in the side mirror. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what that stuff does to you long term.‚Äù

Blu cackled. ‚ÄúUh, yeah, I do. Makes movies funnier, makes food taste better, and helps me not wanna throttle people like Brandon.‚Äù

I let it go with a huff and rested my head on the cold window. The glass vibrated against my temple. For a while I watched the trees blur into smears of green. ‚ÄúSo, where are we even going next?‚Äù

Blu tapped her fingers against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúGotta stash this thing somewhere safe before my mom and K√°la see it. After that, that‚Äôs up to you.‚Äù

The trees gave way to the edges of Old Town. A scattering of storefronts passed us by. ‚ÄúWanna go on a date or something?‚Äù

Blu‚Äôs head turned just enough for me to catch the sharp lift of her brow. ‚ÄúA date?‚Äù

My reflection in the window looked flushed. ‚ÄúI mean, yeah. Why not? After everything we‚Äôve been through, maybe we deserve something that isn‚Äôt caves and skeletons and-‚Äú

Blu barked out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright. A date. That sounds nice.‚Äù

All I could think about is how temporary this all felt. Sooner or later, I‚Äôd have to leave Castenada behind, go back to my job, and pretend like none of this even happened. But I also couldn‚Äôt picture myself fitting back into it. What if the glimpses never went away? What would I even say if someone noticed something was off? I couldn‚Äôt exactly tell my coworkers, *sorry if I seem distracted, I keep remembering what it feels like to die in someone else‚Äôs body.*

I hadn‚Äôt really thought about my uncle since the funeral. Not the way you‚Äôre supposed to, anyway. I should‚Äôve been mourning him and honoring his memory in some way, but instead I‚Äôd fully distracted myself with all of *this* to avoid thinking about what it meant to lose him or what it said about me that it didn‚Äôt hurt as much as it probably should have.

The truth was I didn‚Äôt really want to go back to that cave. Not because of what we might see, but because I didn‚Äôt want Blu getting hurt. I had only known her a day or two, yet somehow she felt closer to me than people I‚Äôd spent years around. And that scared the hell out of me.

However, I've never used a Vertuo machine and never tasted the coffee from one. They're much less and somewhat subsidised through Nespresso. I also got an original machine so I could try third party pods, but in the last 3 years of owning one I've used Nespresso 99% of the time anyway. 

(I could probably get my machine fixed as it's only the heating element/regulator for the milk frother that's broken - but who knows how long the will take).

I am 23F, have been consistent to gym (6 days a week) for the past 4months. I was 84kgs when I joined and am have lost 7-8kgs since then. But sometimes the weight changes are very slow compared to other times. seeing changes in body posture and a bit inches but not very significant weightloss types, and have many tummy rolls (wanna get rid of that).

Diet (am able to follow this for almost 5-6 days a week):  
replaced wheat with jowar and normal rice with boiled and strained (whenever rarely I have rice)  
Breakfast - half cup of Oats with cocoa and half spoon honey (half banana sometimes) + black coffee  
Lunch - 1 jowar chapati + sabzi (simple) + dahi + cucumber  
Snacks - (1-2 oats biscuits/a cup makhana) + black coffee/green tea  
Dinner - stir fried veggies / (one chapati + sabzi) /  upma / poha / 2chilla (with soya chunks)  
dinner is usually something like this only  
water intake - 3lt/day

Workout timing:  
Sedentary lifestyle, used to go to gym at night but now in morning as I can do early dinner this way  
  
Workout split:  
tried a few in some time (I know I should stick on one but can't decide which)  
**1.** Started with (Push, Pull, Legs)x2 but started to avoid cardio so wanted to change  
**2.** A trainer then suggested me this  
Monday - chest + tricep + shoulder  
Tuesday - back + biceps + rear dealt (fly)  
Wednesday - glutes(1-2 variation) + hamstring(2-3) + calves(1) + abs(2-3 variation)   
Thursday - arms + cardio   
Friday - back + chest + shoulder  
Saturday - quads +abs +cardio  
didn't like this much as it was too confusing (went back to PPLx2)  
**3.** Now I am thinking of following this from next week (devised this myself, please suggest changes I am a newbie)  
Monday - cardio + abs  
Tuesday - back + treadmill  
Wednesday - glute + hamstrings  
Thursday - arms + abs  
Friday - chest + shoulder + treadmill  
Saturday -  quads + calves + (a bit of glutes)

I would say I give 70% into diet and in weight training I give my 90% (I feel I am ok with weights) and 50% in cardio and 30% in abs

I wanna be more serious towards my weight loss and gym journey. I am planning to continue gym for long in future but atleast wanna see weightloss a bit faster for now.

Thanks for bearing with me for this long post, would really appreciate any suggestion or advice or any thing you wanna ask :)",1,1757683530.0,Fitness_India,1,1.0,False
1nf36d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1nf36d6/should_you_get_the_best_wireless_headphones_poly/,Should You Get the Best Wireless Headphones Poly Voyager Focus,"I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what to expect when I came across the Poly 211710-101 Voyager Focus UC headset, but it has been a fascinating journey using it in my daily life. Whether I‚Äôm tackling work calls, enjoying music during breaks, or even attempting to drown out the chaos of a bustling household, this headset has shown its strengths and a few tricky spots worth mentioning. Crafted for professionals and audiophiles alike, it promises functionality, versatility, and ease of use. But does it live up to all the hype? Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

**Comfort and Build Quality**  
The Voyager Focus UC immediately strikes you with its sleek, modern over-the-head design. It‚Äôs lightweight, weighing only 5.5 ounces, making it suitable for extended wear. I found the padding on the ear cups and headband particularly helpful on long workdays, as it provides adequate cushioning without feeling too snug or overly loose. Its adjustable fit ensures compatibility with various head sizes‚Äîthough I did notice that if you wear glasses, it might press down slightly over time. That said, the overall durability left me impressed. The materials feel premium, and it has held up well over weeks of use, surviving more than a few accidental desk drops.  

**Audio Performance and Noise Isolation**  
What caught my attention the most was the sound quality. Equipped with dynamic drivers, the Voyager Focus delivers rich, immersive audio spanning frequencies from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Whether grooving to music or focusing on a conference call, I could appreciate the fine balance of bass, mids, and treble. The standout feature for me, however, is the active noise cancellation. It isn‚Äôt flawless‚Äînoticeable high-pitched chatter might occasionally filter through‚Äîbut for the price point, it‚Äôs hard to argue. You‚Äôll definitely feel like you‚Äôve tuned into your own oasis. The noise-canceling microphone is another brilliant addition, ensuring that during calls, my voice comes through more crisp and clear than the competing chaos in the room.

[Check Poly 211710-101 Voyager Focus UC price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b08f8v6fpg/)

**Connectivity and Range**  
Setting up the Voyager Focus was a breeze. Its Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity paired seamlessly with both my laptop and smartphone. I loved the flexibility of being able to switch between devices on the fly, which is ideal when you‚Äôre transitioning from a Zoom meeting on the computer to answering calls on the phone. The wireless range is another jaw-dropper. Advertised at 98 feet, I was skeptical at first, but to my surprise, it held up exceptionally well. I could step into the kitchen for a coffee refill while still being connected to my office desk‚Äîno lag, no stutter. However, the slight downside is that this version doesn‚Äôt come with a charging stand, which feels like a miss for such a product. Instead, a protective case is included, which is perfect for portability but doesn‚Äôt add the convenience you‚Äôd get from a stand.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
The performance of the battery is solid‚Äîlasting through the workday without any mid-task interruptions. A single full charge has averaged me 12 hours of continuous talk or listening time. For someone like me, hopping from one virtual meeting to another, this endurance has been invaluable. Charging is achieved via USB-C, which makes it fast and convenient. That‚Äôs said, while the included lithium polymer battery gets the job done, it would have been great to see a quick-charge feature to add a few hours of juice from just a short plug-in session.

**Good Aspects**  
‚Ä¢ Clear, vibrant sound quality suitable for music and calls  
‚Ä¢ Effective active noise cancellation for focusing in noisy environments  
‚Ä¢ Lightweight and comfortable for extended use  
‚Ä¢ Exceptional wireless connectivity with a broad range  
‚Ä¢ Noise-canceling mic ensures excellent clarity during calls  

**Hurdles**  
‚Ä¢ Missing charging stand with this version  
‚Ä¢ Glasses wearers might experience minor discomfort during extended use  
‚Ä¢ Noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt block out all background chatter entirely  

**Competing Brands**  
The first product that comes to mind as a rival is the Bose 700 headphones. While Bose offers slightly more advanced noise-canceling features and an arguably more luxurious build, the Voyager Focus UC excels in professional usability, particularly with its adept voice-capturing microphone and comfortable design. Another contender is the Jabra Evolve2 85, which boasts better battery life and multiple device pairing, but costs considerably more. In weighing affordability versus features, the Voyager Focus UC holds its ground well for its target market. However, I would have preferred Poly to include the charging stand like Jabra does in many bundles.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
When considering price-to-performance, the Voyager Focus UC is a compelling choice. Loaded with professional-level features without the jaw-dropping, wallet-busting cost of some competitors, it strikes an appealing balance. While the absence of a stand and other minor issues could make some people hesitate, the overall experience is more than satisfactory for its category. If you‚Äôre hunting for a reliable all-rounder that tackles work communication and casual listening with aplomb, the Voyager Focus solidly ticks those boxes.

This one‚Äôs short but sweet. I was sitting in a coffee shop working on my laptop, wearing a plain white button-down. Apparently, that was close enough to the barista uniform because a lady waved me down aggressively and shouted:

‚ÄúExcuse me, I need more Splenda over here!‚Äù

I looked up, totally startled, and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, ‚Äù

She snapped her fingers. ‚ÄúNow, please.‚Äù

The actual barista came rushing over, gave her the sugar packets, and then said: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, he‚Äôs a customer.‚Äù

The lady looked at me, then at my laptop, then at her coffee‚Ä¶ and instead of apologizing, she muttered: ‚ÄúWell, you shouldn‚Äôt dress like staff.‚Äù

1nf32h5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nf32h5,Lessons from 10+ Years on the Streets,"I‚Äôve been shooting street photos for over a decade. I started when I was 18, and now, as I approach 30, I‚Äôve picked up a few lessons worth sharing.

**1.**¬†***Health Comes First***  
Street photographers are artists at heart, but too many of us let the ‚Äúartist‚Äù identity take over. They put the work above everything else and burn out. Don‚Äôt be that person. Your health should always come first. Work out, eat well, cut back on drugs and alcohol. When you take care of your body, you‚Äôll last longer‚Äîboth in life and in photography.

**2.**¬†***Be a Professional***  
I grew up skating and filming graffiti, so my style has always been raw, rebellious, and in your face. But it took me years to learn what professionalism really meant. I‚Äôm still that degenerate with a camera, but I know when and how to use it. The trick is to be the black sheep disguised as a white sheep. Blend in when you need to, but don‚Äôt lose your edge.

**3.**¬†***Blend In to Stand Out***  
Disguising yourself as the ‚Äúwhite sheep‚Äù is crucial for capturing intimate moments. People always say,¬†*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover.‚Äù*¬†But in reality, that‚Äôs all we do. If you want access to all kinds of people, you need to look approachable. Dress normal. Don‚Äôt give off ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù energy. Some photographers can pull off unique looks, but if your goal is to photograph everyone‚Äîfrom the rich to the forgotten‚Äîneutrality works best.

**4.**¬†***Study the Greats***  
I keep stacks of photo books on my desk‚ÄîAlex Webb, Vivian Maier, Bruce Gilden. I mark them up with notes, trying to understand why they pressed the shutter at¬†*that*¬†moment. What caught their attention? What made the photo work? The more you study, the more those instincts kick in naturally when you‚Äôre out on the street.

**5.**¬†***Shoot Every Day***  
Be obsessed with photography. Train your eye so that even when you‚Äôre not shooting, you see photos everywhere. Walking down the street, you should catch yourself thinking,¬†*‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good photo.‚Äù*

**Minor tips that help me:**

* **Keep it small.**¬†I use a Fuji Film XT-5 with a 23mm lens. Easy to carry in a sling bag.
* **Eat light.**¬†When you‚Äôre walking all day, big meals slow you down. I stick to bananas, nuts, black coffee, or sugar-free Red Bull for energy.
* **Set challenges.**¬†Flash only. People only. Walk to a destination and capture three usable photos. Limits force creativity.
* **Treat it like work.**¬†The more you see photography as work, the more your brain stays switched ‚Äúon.‚Äù

**Final Thoughts**

For me, street photography boils down to three things:

1. **Observation**¬†‚Äì Train your eye to notice the details, the abnormalities, the tension in a scene.
2. **Courage**¬†‚Äì Step in close and take the shot, even when it feels uncomfortable.
3. **Instinct**¬†‚Äì Once you‚Äôre in position, trust your gut. Read the light, the space, the emotion, the composition, the color.

These are lessons from my own path. Everyone develops a unique style, so take what resonates and leave what doesn‚Äôt.

I just closed on a home ($600k, 10% down, 6.5% 30-yr in NC), and I‚Äôm curious how your buying experiences compared to mine. What worked well for you? What you wish had been different? How technology (or the lack of it) played a role.

**My main takeaway:**  
As someone who works in tech, I was surprised at how dated the whole process felt. Communication was scattered across emails, texts, and calls. There was no central hub for keeping track of homes I toured, my notes, comps, neighborhood insights, etc. This wasn‚Äôt just one agent either,  it was across multiple. Did anyone else feel this gap?

I can never turn my brain off and am always thinking of product ideas that tech/AI. could improve. Things like

* Compare final contenders side-by-side based on your priorities
* Get a feel for a neighborhood (walk/drive to the coffee shop, park quality, local vibes), especially if you aren't from that area, or deciding between neighborhoods
* Centralize everything in one place instead of juggling inboxes and texts

**Some personal reflections:**

* I searched in a wide area (multiple zip codes across a 3-hour radius), so I worked with several agents. In most cases, I had already pulled the listings, run my own comps, and just needed access to the homes - which left me questioning the value I was paying for.
* The exception was the fixer I ended up buying in a rural area. My agent‚Äôs connections (contractors, surveyors, lenders, etc.) and willingness to take initiative were invaluable. Without that support, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have moved forward. I actually felt that the commission was worth it in this case

So I keep wondering: is it just agent-to-agent differences in value, or more about the type of property (move-in ready vs. complex fixer)? Probably a mix. Still, with commissions being such a big cost, it feels like there has to be a better model someday. Maybe something that is more transactional, like a cost per home showing

**Curious to hear:**

* Did you feel the same lack of tech, or did you have a more modern/streamlined experience?
* What‚Äôs one piece of tech you wish you‚Äôd had in your process?
* Or conversely, what did your agent do that did feel like true added value?",1,1757682831.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2,1.0,False

I wrote a letter to them, to thank them, and decided to post it in an effort to thank all you peers who are doing the work. 

I‚Äôm currently receiving peer services. I saw them for about 9ish months. We had met so many goals together. It was such a perfect fit, they felt like a friend. They were a really important part of my week. Every Saturday for months, we‚Äôd body double to get me through grad school, then job applications. They supported me through so much. When I first met them, I was overdosing every week and a half. Four times in a row. To now? A finished grad student. I actually work in the field as a therapist now. 

Well anyways, they went on medical leave three months ago‚Ä¶ I kept asking ‚Äúare they really coming back?‚Äù And everyone told me yes, and I tried to believe them.

You who came to my graduation, even though you were on leave. All because you knew how big it was for me. You who watched me struggle, then succeed, then struggle. You who I somehow got vulnerable with when I struggle to be actually be vulnerable. I love you. I‚Äôm sad this is the end of our dynamic duo. We really vibed well. I wish I could have said thank you for all you did for me. I wish I could express how much you did for me.

1nf2tvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1nf2tvk/delve_into_the_best_video_converter_wolverine/,Delve Into the Best Video Converter Wolverine TransMedia Is It Worth It,"The Wolverine TransMedia Video Converter caught my attention because I‚Äôve got several dusty VHS tapes and DVDs from my childhood that I‚Äôve been meaning to digitize for years. This little device seemed like a godsend for finally tackling that ever-growing box of old recordings. Its reputation as a home movie digitizer and converter had me intrigued, so I‚Äôve been putting it to the test over the past few weeks. Here‚Äôs how it performed.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the Wolverine TransMedia feels lightweight, coming in at just over a pound. Its dimensions are compact enough that it doesn‚Äôt dominate your desk or counter space, which is handy if, like me, you can‚Äôt stand bulky equipment. The device‚Äôs matte finish and minimalistic design are functional but not flashy. The 4.3-inch color LCD screen stands out as highly usable. I especially enjoyed previewing content on the screen before I started recording, which saved me from digitizing a few, let‚Äôs say, not-so-interesting moments. If you‚Äôre someone who frequently handles gadgets, you might notice that the buttons feel a bit stiff at first, but after a few uses, they seem to loosen up.  

**Ease of Use**  
Considering I‚Äôm far from a certified tech wizard, I found the interface pretty straightforward. The menu is simple, and the process for converting video is largely plug-and-play. I tested it with an old camcorder, using the included AV-RCA inputs, and was able to record directly onto a USB flash drive. Switching between devices, like a VCR and my ancient DVD player, was relatively seamless. The USB port and SD card slots open up plenty of options for where to save your recordings, and I experimented with both a 32GB SD card and a basic USB 2.0 flash drive. They both worked without issue‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the recording speed slowed down a bit with larger files.  

****Good Points****  
‚Ä¢ Compact and lightweight design, extremely user-friendly even for beginners.  
‚Ä¢ Built-in LCD screen means no connecting to external displays unless you want to.  
‚Ä¢ Versatile file-saving options, from USB and SD cards to even external hard drives.  
‚Ä¢ Converts VHS, DVDs, and even music CDs into digital formats like MP3 and WAV.  

[Check Wolverine TransMedia price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b09dzzzltj/)  

**Performance and Reliability**  
My experience with the actual performance was solid, but not without quirks. The converted digital files maintained respectable video and sound quality‚Äînot crisp, mind you, but definitely good enough for archival purposes. The Wolverine‚Äôs ability to pull analog footage from my camcorder directly to digital formats worked without major hiccups. However, the device occasionally struggled when I tested it with older, lower-quality tapes. I also tried the DVD-to-SD card functionality, and while it worked as advertised, the speed at which it copies isn‚Äôt going to win any races. Prepare to settle in with a cup of coffee while it does its thing.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
‚Ä¢ Buttons feel a bit clunky, especially for fast navigation.  
‚Ä¢ Slower performance with larger or lower-quality files.  
‚Ä¢ Limited to standard USB 2.0 and SD cards with a 32GB maximum‚Äîan upgrade to newer tech would have been great.  

**Competing Products**  
When looking at alternatives, I considered the Elgato Video Capture, a straightforward USB device that captures analog media to digital platforms like a computer. While Elgato focuses more on simplicity with fewer bells and whistles, it does lack the standalone capability of this unit, as it needs a computer to function. Similarly, the Vidbox Video Conversion Suite provides excellent quality but involves more complicated software installations. Between the three, the Wolverine stands out for its self-contained setup that doesn‚Äôt rely on additional devices or software, though it‚Äôs not as polished performance-wise.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For what it offers, Wolverine‚Äôs digitizer positions itself as a budget-friendly option compared to pricier professional-grade solutions. It‚Äôs perfect for families or hobbyists, especially if you have piles of home movies you care about preserving. Of course, it‚Äôs always good to temper expectations‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt the tool for cinema-quality editing, but for rescuing those priceless memories, it‚Äôs more than adequate.

1nf2pwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1nf2pwo/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1nf2mks,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1nf2mks/explore_the_best_coffee_machine_bonavita_bvc2201/,Explore the Best Coffee Machine Bonavita BVC2201 Worth Buying?,"From the moment I unboxed the Bonavita BVC2201TS, I could tell it was designed with coffee enthusiasts in mind. The sleek silver finish combined with stainless steel accents gave it a classy, modern look that fits seamlessly on my kitchen counter. While I‚Äôm no coffee sommelier, I do enjoy brewing quality cups at home, and this 8-cup drip coffee machine seemed like the perfect upgrade from my older, clunky coffee maker. Let‚Äôs dive into how it performed during my testing phase.

**Ease of Use and Simplicity**  
One reason I gravitated towards this coffee machine is its promise of simplicity. Operating it feels intuitive, thanks to its user-friendly button controls. The one-touch operation feature was a major plus during my bleary-eyed mornings, offering effortless brewing with minimal setup. The pre-infusion mode‚Äîwhich wets the coffee grounds before the actual brewing‚Äîstood out to me. It required a quick activation but delivered noticeably richer flavors, highlighting notes in my beans that other machines seemed to miss. Honestly, this little feature alone sold me.

**Advantages**  
- The SCA-certified brewing quality ensures professional-level coffee each morning.  
- Its thermal carafe locks in heat and keeps coffee hot for hours without burning it.  
- The removable water reservoir simplifies the refilling process.  
- It brews eight flavorful cups in under seven minutes‚Äîa time saver for busy mornings.  

**Performance and Speed**  
This machine doesn‚Äôt just make coffee; it makes coffee fast. Producing a full pot in less than seven minutes, it‚Äôs ideal if you need caffeine pronto. The Bonavita maintains the optimal brewing temperature of 194¬∞F to 205¬∞F, ensuring consistent quality with every brew. The wide showerhead design was another unexpected highlight. Water distributes evenly over the coffee grounds, leading to extraction levels far superior to my last machine.

[Want Bonavita BVC2201TS? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0c66s8tyw/)

**Build Quality and Design**  
Its compact footprint surprised me. I expected it to dominate my countertop, but its dimensions‚Äî15""D x 6""W x 12.5""H‚Äîensure it fits snugly even in smaller spaces. The thermal carafe feels sturdy, crafted from stainless steel, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôll wear out after a few months of daily use. The lid locks securely during brewing, and I was pleased to see there was no dripping or mess while pouring. The use of a reusable filter is environmentally friendly, though I had to ensure the filter basket was properly secured to avoid brewing issues.

**Drawbacks**  
- The single-button interface, while straightforward, can feel overly simplistic for those who like to control every parameter of their brew.  
- I found the carafe lid tricky to twist tightly during my first few attempts.  
- It lacks programmable settings, which could deter users looking for hands-off automation.  

**Optimal Features for Coffee Lovers**  
The optional pre-infusion mode had me experimenting with different grind sizes and coffee types. Playing around with this feature made it clear how much of a difference it adds, especially for lighter roasts. I also appreciated how the reservoir‚Äôs clearly marked fill lines ensured foolproof measurements. No more guessing water-coffee ratios! Cleaning proved equally hassle-free. The machine has a one-touch cleaning cycle that handled most of the upkeep, sparing me the extra scrubbing.

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to other drip coffee makers like the Technivorm Moccamaster, the Bonavita BVC2201TS matches closely in terms of brewing capacity and maintaining optimal temperatures. However, the Bonavita edges out with its quick brewing time and pre-infusion mode, both especially useful when I‚Äôm in a hurry. On the other hand, the Moccamaster‚Äôs retro design and customizable brewing controls cater to those craving aesthetic flare. For budget-friendly buyers, machines like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup deliver decent morning brews but lack the depth, consistency, and Golden Cup Standard certification Bonavita provides.

**Worth Every Penny**  
You might wonder if the investment is justified for a coffee maker that doesn‚Äôt offer programmable features. If you‚Äôre after quality and consistency in every cup with minimal effort, this machine does the job beautifully. With its long-lasting thermal carafe and a brewing process aligned with barista-quality coffee standards, it provides superb value over time. While there are cheaper options in its class, I find the Bonavita strikes a perfect balance, catering to coffee aficionados and casual drinkers alike.

Why burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability?

1nf2m07,https://i.redd.it/5x4ozv96fqof1.jpeg,From Sri Lanka‚Äôs Aragalaya to Nepal: Don‚Äôt destroy your own future,"I‚Äôm from Sri Lanka. I lived through our 2022 Aragalaya. People around the world respected us because we fought the system without destroying our own country.

At Galle Face, we protested for 124 days straight. Over 100,000 people joined at times. But here‚Äôs what made it different:

We camped peacefully on Galle Face Green. There were kitchens feeding thousands, medical centers to help anyone sick or injured, book libraries, free internet, and even coffee corners. We built a community, not chaos.

We sang songs, danced, made art, and watch movies ‚Äî yet we never destroyed property. Some critics complained we were ‚Äútoo playful,‚Äù but that didn‚Äôt stop us from being fair, disciplined, and organized.

When we finally entered the President‚Äôs House, we didn‚Äôt loot. Not a single priceless portrait worth millions was stolen. Not a single fire was set. People laughed, swam, sang ‚Äî but respected the place because it belonged to the people.

Even when ministers‚Äô thugs attacked us, the world saw who was violent and who wasn‚Äôt. That moral high ground is what gave us victory.


Now, I look at Nepal and I see motorbikes burned, parliament on fire, leaders‚Äô houses torched. Brothers, ask yourselves: is that really a fight for justice‚Äîor are you burning your own tax money, your own people‚Äôs livelihoods?

Because here‚Äôs the bitter truth:

The cost of every destroyed building, every burned vehicle, will come back to you in higher taxes, worse inflation, more suffering.

If you destroy what belongs to the people, the world will stop listening to your message and only see the flames.

Today you may cheer, but tomorrow you‚Äôll be paying for the very damage you caused.


Please think back. Don‚Äôt let your anger blind you. Sri Lanka proved you can bring down corrupt leaders without burning your country. Hold on to your moral strength. Don‚Äôt make your children pay for your rage.

From one struggling nation to another: don‚Äôt turn your fight for freedom into self-destruction.

1nf2lys,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearShifted/comments/1nf2lys/explore_if_the_best_electric_bike_5th_wheel_eb17/,Explore if the Best Electric Bike 5TH WHEEL EB17 Lives Up to the Hype,"The 5TH WHEEL EB17 electric bike has been my go-to ride for weeks, conquering trails and navigating city streets with ease. The first time I hopped on, I could immediately tell it was built for adventure and performance. With a sleek aluminum frame and a powerful 500W motor that peaks at 1000W, this bike makes not just commuting, but also thrill-seeking rides, feel seamless. Here's my honest take on its features, sprinkled with real-life experiences.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The lightweight yet durable aluminum frame stole my attention right away. At just 50 pounds, the EB17 is easy to maneuver, but it doesn‚Äôt skimp on sturdiness, handling a maximum weight of 265 pounds. The design feels thoughtfully engineered, offering stability and comfort for a wide variety of terrains, from gravel paths to urban roads. Adjusting the handlebars and seat was a breeze, ensuring I got a personalized fit before taking off. I especially appreciated the removable battery design‚Äîit‚Äôs practical for someone like me who charges devices everywhere, from my kitchen to a coworking space.

**Riding Performance**  
The 500W motor might sound modest on paper, but trust me, it delivers a punch. It peaks at 1000W, allowing speeds up to 23MPH, which feels like flying on the right stretch of road. Pair that with the seven-speed gear system, and you‚Äôve got exceptional versatility in power management, whether climbing slopes or cruising on straight roads. Riding up a hilly neighborhood to pick up a coffee became a thrilling activity rather than a chore. The dual disc braking system ensures safety at high speeds, offering precise and timely stops.

**Power-Packed Battery**  
One of the highlights of this bike is the 468Wh lithium battery. During my tests, I clocked around 40 miles using a mix of pedal-assist and electric modes, which is pretty close to the promised range of 25‚Äì45 miles. Detaching the battery for charging was straightforward, and its compact size made it easy to tuck into a backpack when I stopped by the gym. Forgetting to charge one day turned into a blessing in disguise‚ÄîI had a blast manually pedaling and rediscovering the joy of unassisted cycling!

**Personalized Experience with the Digital Display**  
The upgraded color LCD display doesn‚Äôt just look sleek; it‚Äôs genuinely functional. Tracking speed, battery percentage, and mileage was a piece of cake, even under bright sunlight. Switching between throttle-on-demand, pedal-assist, or full manual mode is smooth and just takes a tap, offering full control over every riding scenario. My favorite part? Feeling like I had three bikes in one! Whether zipping through morning traffic or leisurely cruising along a riverside path, this display kept me informed and in charge.

[Check 5TH WHEEL EB17 price on Amazon.](https://rulse.com/p/b0d9b7df6r/)

**Safety Features That Boost Confidence**  
A key benefit of the EB17 has to be its focus on safety. The adjustable front suspension absorbs shocks and bumps effortlessly, making rough trails feel far less daunting. One rainy evening, I navigated dimly lit streets and felt reassured by the bright headlight paired with a reflector‚Äîthe visibility it offers is superb. If you value a safe ride, whether during a winter commute or a night spin, these features really shine.

**Advantages**  
- Powerful motor with a 1000W peak allows strong uphill climbing capabilities.  
- Durable yet lightweight aluminum frame offers excellent maneuverability.  
- Long-lasting battery with versatile charging options enhances convenience.  
- Adjustable seat and handlebars accommodate riders of various heights.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The bike‚Äôs weight at 50 pounds may feel slightly heavy for petite riders carrying it upstairs.  
- The assembly process requires close attention to detail, even though 85% of it is pre-done.
- A rear suspension would elevate comfort for extreme off-road conditions.

**Market Rivals**  
While the EB17 comes with its strong suits, there are a few comparable bikes in the market. For instance, the RadPower RadRover 6 Plus offers better all-terrain tires and hydraulic brakes but also comes at a steeper price. On the flip side, the Ancheer 500W electric bike is a budget-friendly competitor but lacks the peak motor power and robust battery life of the EB17. What sets this bike apart is its versatility‚Äîit feels equally at home on urban commutes and off-road adventures, something not every rival can promise.

**Value for Money**  
The 5TH WHEEL EB17 electric bike isn‚Äôt cheap, but it delivers a solid bang for the buck. Given its excellent performance, durable design, and a range of thoughtful safety features, it justifies its cost. The fact that it incorporates a removable battery, quality suspension, and multi-mode options makes it stand out in its price bracket. For anyone looking to invest in a dual-purpose bike that blends modern technology with comfort, it‚Äôs a smart choice.

I did some follow up research, and stopped taking it with my morning coffee. I did experience a quick weight loss of what I assume was water weight. Regardless, it was enough to make me stick with the real stuff for a while.

I recently experienced a rebound weight gain because honestly I dropped my fastidiousness on my diet over a very long vacation. On this vacation, I also developed a taste for fun coffee concoctions üòà 

I‚Äôd like to lose the weight I gained back. However, I would still like to enjoy some of my coffee concoctions. I want to enjoy my food and have fun with it when I can. 

Would it be worthwhile to use the sugar free stuff while I buckle down and get my weight back under control? Or, is it likely to have the opposite effect?",0,1757682036.0,WeightLossAdvice,9,0.4,False

1nf2j9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1nf2j9h/vyvanse_trigger_bfs/,Vyvanse trigger BFS?,"Curious is anyone has any experience with stimulants triggering BFS. I have been on and off of ADHD medication for the last 25-30 years (37M) but have been taking adderall 5-7 days per week for the last 10 years. For some reason, I started having crazy crashes on adderall and was quite irritable, hence a swap to Vyvanse (crashes and mood swings gone immediately).

March 1 - switched to Vyvanse

June 1 - both calves started twitching every second of the day and have not stopped since. Also, i can make my calves and feet cramp on command just by flexing.

Mid August - twitches have spread to nearly every other part of my body (abdominals, biceps, triceps, eyes, tongue, pectorals, etc). Thankfully, these twitches last for a few seconds and stop. Probably 5-7 muscles will twitch for a few seconds throughout the day, but frequency is increasing.

I‚Äôve started making a slew of lifestyle changes to try and reverse this:
- currently day 3 with no coffee (reduced over 3 weeks to 1-2 cups from 3-4 instead of cold turkey)
- improved diet (mostly just eating more frequent meals‚Ä¶meds kill my appetite)
- increased water intake to 1 gallon (3.75L) daily (previous was closer to 0.5 gallon)
- supplementing D3 (deficient), B12 (just in case), magnesium glycinate (doc recommended for sleep)
- standing desk at work for 2-4 hours instead of sitting the entire day
- trying to have healthier sleep habits
- daily stretching 

Nothing has helped so far, granted the changes are still relatively new.

Other notes:
- the twitches don‚Äôt affect my sleep
- I wake up with a calf cramp in the morning 2-3x per week
- saw a neurologist at the recommendation of my PCP
- neuro suspects BFS or CFS and scheduled an EMG next week to rule out the bad stuff
- neuro prescribed me 300mg of gabapentin to take at night to help with sleep
- I have a history of lower back pain, including a discectomy in 2017. Have minor daily pain, but overall there hasn‚Äôt been any relevant changes to my back pain in several years.
- mentally, I‚Äôm in good shape. I believe something triggered the calf twitching, and I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what it is.

All this said, has anyone experienced this onset after starting Vyvanse?

It sounds like some of my guests stayed over after the party last night. I stretch as I cross my room, glancing out the window of my 21st story flat at the city below. I find a fresh pair of shorts to put on and decide to forgo putting on a bra instead I leave on the extra large T shirt I slept in. The smell of coffee and breakfast foods is too tempting to waste time trying to look nice, I figure it's just my roomies and Carly and Jessica anyways...

Sounds like a pretty average dream right? Not particularly special or exciting...
Only, I don't live in a city apartment or have multiple female roommates that I partied with the night before and I don't drink coffee...oh, and I'm a dude in real life not a girl...

This is just one example of many many dreams ive had which included a new identity complete with personality, preferences and both long and short term  memories (though it typically gets fuzzier beyond a couple days ago). And this example isn't even one of the weirder ones...I've ""been"" people with tragic, complex lives or who are from ancient times...I've even been in places that haven't existed yet or perhaps exist on other planets. 

The memories feel so real that when I wake up I'll often have a profound feeling of loss and panic as I try, in vain, to prevent most of the memories from fading away like a puddle on a hot day. I wonder if that how it feels to have Alzheimer's. 

The strangest part is the rare occasion when one of these dreams become lucid. When this happens it's like a battle occurs in my brain to determine which set of memories are real, and in the process I will typically black out in the dream but in those few seconds much of the dream memory ends up being stored ""properly"". When I wake back up in the dream afterwards it's incredibly enlightening, I am able to really see what it's like to live in someone elses shoes while still retaining my own perspective and agency. 

The dream I described in the beginning was one of the dreams where I became lucid and to this day I feel like I have these fragmented memories of growing up in a big city as a woman. I also got to find out what it feels like to have boobs which was..interesting. 

I'm writing this because no one I've ever told about it has said they have experienced the same thing. So I am wondering how common this is and what people think it means. I know the human brain is capable of crazy, amazing things but I have to admit sometimes I've wondered if these other people actually exist somewhere or if they are somehow connected to me.

Bahrain‚Äôs strategic push for 99% foreign ownership (details here) and flexible commercial registration (official MOICT process) has attracted both regional and international investors.\
According to Reuters, Bahrain‚Äôs tech sector saw a 23% increase in cyberattacks in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024‚Äîmostly phishing and ransomware targeting financial services and SMEs in Seef and Diplomatic Area.\
\
‚Äú2019‚Äôs digital transformation wave was just the start. 2025 is the year cyber risks outpace business expansion,‚Äù said a Bahrain Information & eGovernment Authority official in a recent Gulf News feature.\

The New Cybersecurity Landscape: Regulations You Must Know\
2025 Regulatory Update: Compulsory Cybersecurity Officer for Some Sectors\
Did you know? From January 2025, Bahrain‚Äôs Central Bank and MOICT require all financial institutions, fintech start-ups, and any foreign-owned company processing customer data (including eCommerce) to appoint a dedicated IT Security Officer‚Äîwhether in-house or outsourced. Non-compliance risks fines of up to BHD 10,000 and potential temporary suspension of Sijilat registration.\
For other sectors, a full-time officer is ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù but not strictly enforced‚Äîyet. But the writing is on the wall. With LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) now including cybersecurity controls in annual audits (as of March 2025), the expectations apply well beyond just banks.\
Stay updated with Bahrain‚Äôs regulatory news.\
\
Should YOU Appoint a Dedicated IT Security Officer?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. Legally Compulsory\
Personal Insight: Three years ago, while assisting a logistics start-up in Bahrain Bay, we faced a data breach‚Äîtraceable to a lack of central IT oversight. Fixing the mess cost more than a year‚Äôs salary for a mid-tier IT security professional.\
Key reasons to appoint a dedicated IT Security Officer:\
\
Regulatory Compliance: Proactive hiring avoids regulatory scramble and hurried (often more expensive) last-minute fixes.\
Brand Trust: Bahrain business culture values reputation‚Äîan avoidable data breach can permanently damage relationships, especially with partners in the Diplomatic Area and Gulf states.\
Insurance Requirements: Most Gulf insurers now require appointment of a security officer for cyber insurance policies covering >BHD 50,000.\
Client Demands: Multinational clients, especially those operating in Seef or Bahrain Bay tech hubs, increasingly specify security officer contact as a precondition.\
Operational Resilience: The officer‚Äôs input can save thousands by preempting ransomware or phishing damages.\
\
And here‚Äôs a personal challenge: During a client audit in 2022, not having a named security contact meant LMRA delayed our visa block approval by four weeks. (My tip: Always list your IT security officer in the Sijilat portal from day one‚Äîit saves days of re-submission.)\

Bahrain Company Formation: Step-by-Step Guide + Insider Tips\
\

* Free Zones are an option for tech companies (free zone benefits explained).\
* A local sponsor is rarely required but can be strategic for government contracts (see sponsorship options).\
Insider Tip: Diplomatic Area offices often process company registrations faster than Seef, especially right after Ramadan when applicant volumes are lower.\
Step 2: Prepare and Submit Application\
\
Register via Sijilat portal (company formation steps).\
Required: Passport copies, MOA (Memorandum of Association), office lease, and newly (as of April 2025) your cybersecurity responsibility statement.\
Appoint your IT security officer during initial registration‚Äîdoing so later triggers a BHD 60 amendment fee.\
\
Document Shortcut: Draft your IT policy using MOICT‚Äôs new online template (saves 2-3 days versus a custom version‚Äîlearned this after a costly delay last year).\
Step 3: Secure All Approvals\
\
LMRA: For foreign staff work permits, expect an online interview question about your IT security controls (since March 2025).\
MOICT: Reviews your digital risk statement‚Äîhaving a named security officer gets you automatic ‚Äúfast-track‚Äù eligibility for most tech-focused and financial CRs.\
\
Timing Tip: Tuesday mornings at the MOICT Seef branch see shorter queues. Avoid Sunday post-payday crowds when possible.\

Cost Considerations: Budgeting for IT Security in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
* Outsourced Security-as-a-Service: Annual packages from top Bahrain providers start at BHD 5,500/year‚Äîideal for SMEs.\
* Additional costs: Sijilat registration fee for IT security appointment: BHD 60 (one-time). LMRA visa for a foreign specialist: BHD 380/year.\
Full company formation costs breakdown.\
Saving Money: My Proven Strategies\
\
Bundle IT security with managed IT services‚Äîmany providers offer combined discounts if negotiated pre-formation (I saved a client over BHD 800 this way in 2023).\
Use Tamkeen subsidies; they cover up to 50% of your first IT hire‚Äôs salary if registered within 90 days of CR issuance.\
\
\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Ongoing Obligations\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. must submit security incident logs annually.\
For ongoing compliance, accounting and bookkeeping services that include digital risk checks can make annual renewals almost painless.\
Cultural Note: During Ramadan, audit deadlines sometimes shift by 5‚Äì7 days; always double-confirm with MOICT‚Äîan easy mistake that trips up many new business owners.\

Professional Support: Whom Should You Trust?\

* Keylink Bahrain: Their company formation team (details here) has saved my clients countless hours, plus they‚Äôre proactive with cybersecurity mandates.\
* Tamkeen: For staff funding and SME digitalization grants.\
Common Mistake: Many expat founders skip professional advice, relying solely on online forms. I once saw a client in Bahrain Bay lose three months to registration back-and-forth because their IT documentation didn‚Äôt exactly match MOICT‚Äôs template. Prevention: download and use the most recent MOICT compliance checklist before you even start your application.\
\
A Tangent on Coffee, Connectivity, and Business Security\
Bahrain‚Äôs legendary hospitality is more than a custom‚Äîthere‚Äôs a business logic to it. In my experience, many breakthrough security deals get ironed out not in boardrooms, but over endless rounds of Arabic coffee in Seef‚Äôs quieter majlis corners. Networking there has helped me sidestep delays and get crucial advice on local tech vendors long before I‚Äôd spot them at industry expos. It‚Äôs a reminder: in Bahrain, relationships are your first‚Äîand best‚Äîline of defense.\
\
FAQ: IT Security Officers and Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Is a dedicated IT Security Officer mandatory for all Bahrain companies in 2025?\
Not yet for all sectors, but it‚Äôs required for finance, fintech, and any company handling customer digital data. Enforcement began January 2025 and is expanding. For everyone else, strong recommendation applies. See CR requirements.\
2. What documents do I need to appoint an IT Security Officer during company formation?\
You‚Äôll need: officer CV, digital risk policy, appointment letter, and Sijilat cyber responsibility form. The Keylink formation process guide covers each step.\
3. Can I outsource the role if I don‚Äôt want to hire in-house?\
Yes, MOICT and LMRA now accept outsourced providers, if registered with a Bahrain-based security firm. Many SMEs prefer annual packages, which also help with compliance audits. Full cost breakdown here.\
4. Are there any cost-saving incentives for hiring IT security staff?\
Tamkeen offers partial salary funding and digitalization grants. Apply within 90 days of CR issue for best results. More on local support and sponsorship.\
5. What‚Äôs the best timing and location to submit my application for fast processing?\
Diplomatic Area offices are fastest post-Ramadan. Mid-week mornings avoid major rushes (Tuesdays are best). Prepare all compliance docs beforehand‚Äîespecially cybersecurity forms. See business type structures for strategic choices.\

1nf2fbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1nf2fbe/from_streetwear_to_fandom_the_rise_of_anime/,From Streetwear to Fandom: The Rise of Anime T-Shirts,"In recent years, the fashion world has witnessed a bold fusion of culture, creativity, and personal expression through the explosion of anime-themed clothing. What once was a niche interest tucked away in the corners of comic book stores and conventions has now become a vibrant movement embraced by global audiences. At the center of this evolution stands a standout trend: anime T-shirts.

Anime T-shirts have become a symbol of identity for fans, a way to wear their favorite stories, characters, and moments on their sleeves‚Äîliterally. These shirts aren‚Äôt just about graphics slapped on cotton; they represent passion. Whether it's a minimalist design featuring a subtle reference or a loud, colorful print showcasing an iconic scene, each T-shirt tells a story that resonates with its wearer.

One of the key reasons behind this trend's rise is the seamless blend between streetwear and pop culture. Today‚Äôs fashion-savvy youth aren‚Äôt afraid to mix anime art with everyday outfits. Oversized anime T-shirts paired with ripped jeans, layered under hoodies, or even dressed up with skirts and boots‚Äîanything goes. It‚Äôs no longer about dressing to fit in, but about dressing to stand out. These tees reflect not just fandom, but confidence and individuality.

Moreover, anime T-shirts have broken down cultural barriers. They‚Äôre not just worn in Japan or at comic cons anymore‚Äîthey're everywhere. From coffee shops in New York to markets in Berlin, people proudly wear their favorite characters with a sense of pride. It‚Äôs a universal language of style and storytelling that brings fans together regardless of geography.

**Anime Graphic Tees** have also become a conversation starter. They spark connections, often leading to moments where strangers bond over a shared love for a particular series. Wearing one can be both a bold fashion statement and a subtle nod to the community you belong to. They're stylish, comfortable, and timelessly cool.

In a world where fashion trends come and go, anime T-shirts have carved out their own unique and lasting space. They've evolved from simple merchandise to meaningful wardrobe staples that reflect both personal tastes and pop culture‚Äôs powerful influence.

So, whether you're a hardcore otaku or just appreciate great design, there‚Äôs no denying the impact anime T-shirts have made. They‚Äôre not just clothes‚Äîthey‚Äôre a movement.",1,1757681573.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

Of course I love the builds, and the ideas and inspiration that come with DLC, but on a raining Sunday morning when I wake up and think about playing a bit while I drink my coffee, I am consistently disappointed by bugs, repetitive animations and just unrealistic scenarios. ¬†I understand we don‚Äôt play sims for the logic, but the fact that every scenario and situation I find myself a part of, takes me out of it completely. I end up just drinking my coffee and typing this rant.¬†

Do EA actually play the game at all? 
Do they experiment with the combination of different packs? Do they complete 100 Baby Challenge or the like just as their players do?¬†
All are they all just a bunch of NPC‚Äôs?

I was so thrilled for burglars to return to the sims and for one to finally come to my sims house! I got that same pang of dread when I realised I had forgotten to install the burglar alarm, the same feeling from the old days of playing Sims 2. But then for my sim to wake up, and non-chalantly call the police as if she were chatting to a friend, and then watch TV, with no reaction to an intruder, is just bizarre. Not only did the police not end up showing at all, but my sim didn‚Äôt even manage to fight off the burglar. She went outside to where the burglar was, and then reacted positively to the rain. Now with the typical glitch of the umbrella, she attempts to engage with the man. Finally she reacts (same mad frenzy as if there were a fire) and she ran back through the house and out the front door? Like hello, I asked you to fight the guy.. not run away??¬†

The burglar made away and my sim continued with her morning. Her high confidence moodlet completely overshadowed any sense of urgency in the matter. There was barely in reaction to her having been robbed. In my head I‚Äôm trying to fill in the gaps myself like ‚Äòperhaps she is so confident that she is unbothered by burglars‚Äô, but then why did she have that little freak out? I just don‚Äôt buy it. Additionally, with the recent implementation of ‚ÄòLuck‚Äô from Enchanted by Nature; my sim was supposedly as ‚Äòlucky‚Äô as can be. So then why did a burglar target her? I imagined initially that luck is supposed to have some sort of control over what happens to sims, but I guess that‚Äôs just in my head.

Am I playing the game wrong?¬†
I feel so disinterested and so disheartened by this franchise. ¬†Each time a new EP is released, I get giddy and imagine what it would be like to play, and after spending such a lot of money on yet another pack, I‚Äôm completely withdrawn after 10 minutes.¬†

Perhaps it‚Äôs time we realised that Sims is dead. Best I just stick to Stardew Valley.

Am I alone in this?¬†

Can anyone similar experiences of unorthodox gameplay, uncalled for, illogical behaviours that completely remove you from the game?¬†
I don‚Äôt mean like sims doing pushups on a date, I mean sims doing pushups while their mum is dying in front of them.

OR, does anyone know how to rationalise these situations and find interest in such gameplay?¬†

Your thoughts on this ‚Äòtoxic Smart‚Äô drama?,"Any other ahensya people here?? Because honestly, I‚Äôm scratching my head at this ‚Äútoxic Smart‚Äù narrative. Let me tell you something. I‚Äôve been in advertising since 1999. I‚Äôve seen the telco wars up close and the rise of Globe as trendsetter, then Smart‚Äôs unbelievable turnaround under ARM (Boy Martirez). I wasn‚Äôt on the Smart account, but our colleagues were. And yes ‚Äì  the horror stories were real. ARM maaking agencies wait all day, then coming back close to midnight for a deck. Demanding. Ruthless. Exacting.

But you know what? That‚Äôs marketing as war. That‚Äôs ad agency life. We pulled all-nighters, lived on coffee and pancit canton, because we like to win. If our clients win, we win. And when Smart overtook Globe in just a couple of years? That was a superhuman feat. My friends who worked on Smart back then were exhausted but fulfilled. They won.

So imagine my disgust now, reading Smart employees complaining about long hours, overtime, holidays. Hello?? Welcome to advertising, to FMCG, to banking, to telco wars. This is not a kumbaya job. You‚Äôre playing catch-up with Globe and Converge and you‚Äôre whining about OT? Kaya pala laging second place.

Yes, ARM is ‚Äúsexist.‚Äù Newsflash: most boomer bosses are. Doesn‚Äôt excuse it, but it doesn‚Äôt erase what he accomplished. Because kita namin how he believes in himself and the things he was introducing. We were on the team. And compared to agency life, Smart execs have it easy thes days esp: fat paychecks, full benefits, corporate packages. We in agencies never had those. But we gave 110% because our clients‚Äô success was our pride.

So, to the new Smart generation: maybe stop whining, start winning. That‚Äôs the only culture shift that matters.",0,1757681376.0,CorpoChikaPH,6,0.2,False

my relationship with my partner was so beautiful. it was the best id ever had. we got on so well. communicated so well. i knew deep in my heart this was for life.

about 2 months ago we tried opening up our relationship. we felt like there was so much love between us that there was excess that we could give to others. that sounds so stupid now but we believed it.

my partner and the person they started seeing (21FTM) behaved very badly. everything moved very fast, and their connection was quickly a lot deeper than what was being communicated to me. i found out that the other person has split up with their partner of three years because of how intense their relationship was. this all happened in about 3 weeks.

im distraught. it takes ages for my partner to listen to me. i miss my period that month due to the stress. finally we decide to be monogamous again, much to the dismay of my partner. i found out later they were really upset by it.

im a mess, still am. but i really thought we were working on it. we had a lovely weekend together recently, and i thought things were getting better.

but i was venting about this all to some mutual friends last night (All F, mid 20s). they all told me to leave. they said some terrible things about my partner, which shocked me because these people are more their friends than mine.

one of the people there was someone who'd had a past FWB with my partner. this was years ago. apparently a few months back they went for coffee and my partner had told them they still had lingering feelings for them, and sometimes felt jealous when they saw her with her boyfriend.

i really wish i hadn't known that. i got really upset and left abruptly, my partner and i had a huge fight last night. and we might break up i don't know. im a bit upset with that friend because i don't think it was appropriate for them to bring that up after id already talked about all these insecurities. it felt a little mean and pointed actually.

anyway. im reluctant to completely give up because up until a few months ago this was a wonderful relationship. but i feel like after all this it's almost expected of me. im at a loss. i know reddit is going to tell me to break it off as reddit always does. im just a mess. i know we can probably work it out but i also know it will never be the same. and i don't know if i can live with that. how do i move forward from this?",2,1757681283.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

**1) Input**  
You just type freeform notes like:‚ÄúLunch with Alex Friday at noon. Submit draft by Monday. Remind me to check the logs tomorrow morning. Buy milk and coffee.‚Äù

**2) Processing**

   * Task ‚Üí Submit draft (Due Monday)
   * Reminder ‚Üí Check logs (Tomorrow 9 AM)
   * Note ‚Üí Shopping: Milk, Coffee

On Sunday evening we went out for a play session for our dog. We usually drink something cold at the cafe where we take him but because of my throat I wanted something warm. They had only chai and coffee, both of which would have kept me up if I drank them so late. So I told my husband I don't want anything to drink as they don't have lemon tea, and got a starter. I happily drank the hot water I brought and was relaxing. Suddenly the waiter brought me my favourite soothing beverage - a hot lemon tea with honey and lemon on the side. My husband had asked for black tea and lemon and honey and it totally took me by surprise. It was just a small gesture, but it meant so much <3

It was extra special because just as I was drinking my tea, my brother called, and I was able to yap with him happily on the phone as my throat was no longer sore.

Edit: he even had requested that they add ginger to the black tea so it was really good, just the way I like it. not that weak tea bag stuff",37,1757681211.0,InsideIndianMarriage,8,0.91,False
1nf29yo,https://i.redd.it/oikt61oecqof1.jpeg,Do You Wanna Play ?,"They sat Infront of each other at the dining table. Plates filled with warm food were steaming 

between them. He was talking about his day at work, gesturing occasionally with his fork. While 

she was listening quietly.

Behind him, near the doorway to the living room there was a small figure standing almost out of 

sight. A little girl with a dress hanging loosely. She was so pale. Her eyes were wide and dark 

staring at them. She held a ragged doll in her arms. Doll‚Äôs mouth crudely sewn shut with black 

thread. The stitches were uneven. The doll‚Äôs blank eyes seemed to follow her.

‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù she asked suddenly.

He looked up and asked. ‚ÄúWho do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe girl you were talking to when I picked you up in this evening.‚Äù

He chuckled lightly. ‚ÄúAh, that. That‚Äôs one of my colleagues. She was saying hi when you arrived.‚Äù

They finished the dinner. She went to the bathroom. She looked at her reflection in the mirror

for a moment. But the glass did not show her own face. It was the little girl‚Äôs pale face. She 

blinked and washed her face as it was always been like that. 

He was cleaning the dinner table when she returned. She reached for the stack of plates to help. 

But a dish accidently slipped off his hands shattering against the floor. The sharp crack echoed 

through the apartment.

From the corner of the room came a piercing scream of a terrified child.

Her own throat followed it before she could stop herself. A scream not entirely her own, raw 

and high-pitched. He dropped the dish towel. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong? It‚Äôs just a plate‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù she snapped, but the voice that broke out wasn‚Äôt quite hers. It was trembling like a 

child.

He stepped closer confused, reaching for her arm. ‚ÄúPlease, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt touch me!‚Äù The words tore from her in a voice layered hers and the child‚Äôs, rising 

together in a shriek. ‚ÄúGet out of my house!‚Äù

The silence afterward felt heavy. He stood frozen searching her face. As if trying to find the 

woman he‚Äôd been having dinner with only moments ago. 

He backed away. ‚ÄúOkay okay. I‚Äôll go.‚Äù

The door shut softly behind him. And the apartment fell into a suffocating stillness. 

After sometime she went to bed and cried herself to sleep. The child lay curled on the other 

side of the bed, clutching her stitched doll.

She found herself standing in an empty playground. The air was cool and the sky was dim. She 

was playing there all alone. She sat on the swing pushing herself clumsily. The doll balanced on 

her lap. Tiny raindrops began to fall from dark sky. Then a sudden crack of lightning struck in the 

distance. 

‚ÄúMom? Dad?‚Äù her voice cracked. No one answered. Her searching grew frantic, footsteps 

pattering against the gravel as she ran from one corner of the playground to another. Her cries 

rose sharp with fear.

The woman woke up gasping. Her room was dark. Her sheets tangled around her legs. On the 

bed beside her lay the doll. Its dark eyes stared upward. Thread-bound mouth still sealed. She 

picked it up. Tried to fix its messy hair with trembling fingers.

She carried it with her to the vanity and sat down. In the mirror child stared back, the doll 

clasped in her arms. The woman exhaled, offering a light warm smile.

‚ÄúDo you wanna play?‚Äù she whispered.

The girl‚Äôs head tilted, staring at her. Then she nodded slowly.

They were at the playground. The air was warm and comfortable. The sky was clear. She stood 

behind the swing, pushing gently. The little girl was sitting on the swing. The playground felt 

alive and filled with happiness. Her laughter rose into the atmosphere. She didn‚Äôt feel alone

anymore. 

Days passed by. Her life was filled with little giggles. They began to learn about each other

slowly. They were no longer strangers haunting the same space but two parts of the same soul.

They completed each other as missing pieces of a puzzle.

One evening, they sat on the bed. The rain pattering outside. She was snipping away the 

stitches of the little doll. Combing its tangled hair.

A crack of thunder split the night suddenly. Lightning flashed white against the window. The girl 

screamed, clutching the doll. Tears streamed down her small face. ‚ÄúWill you leave me? I‚Äôm so 

scared.‚Äù

The woman‚Äôs voice softened, breaking with tenderness. ‚ÄúNo. I won‚Äôt leave you, sweetheart‚Äù

The girl curled into her softly. Small arms wrapped around larger ones, the storm rumbling 

outside. Little by little the crying slowed. Until the girl‚Äôs breaths evened out into sleep.

When morning light spilled across the room, she woke up. The doll was resting on the sheets

next to her. But it was different now. Its fabric seemed fresh, its hair soft and pink ribbons tied 

neatly. Little rosy lips were smiling faintly.

*Six months later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*

The city was busy with people moving in every direction. She had just stepped out of a 

bookstore. A small bag in her hand, when a familiar voice called out.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

She turned. He stood a few steps away. His smile tentative but kind.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she replied softly, smiling back.

‚ÄúHow have you been?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, And you? It‚Äôs been sometime right‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm also fine. Wanna grab a coffee later?‚Äù

‚ÄúOhh, that would be awesome‚Äù she said. Her smile was warm, voice was steady.

My job just started back up as well (teacher), and I‚Äôve been extremely motivated and working my ass off, staying late at least 2-3x a week, volunteering to help out in additional roles, etc. I‚Äôve been sleeping less and really felt like I was kicking ass at work.

My department got some complaints from some other teachers about our schedule last week, and suddenly I am spiraling. I‚Äôve started having panic attacks and racing thoughts like all the time, and very little seems to be helping. I‚Äôve been compulsively cleaning and exercising to make the feelings go away just for a bit. Even when I‚Äôm physically exhausted I‚Äôll find myself scrubbing down the stove or the underside of the coffee table just to distract from the thoughts. I feel so paranoid, I have this sense that everyone at work hates me and is conspiring against me even though I know that‚Äôs stupid.

What do you all think? I feel like it sounds like mania except for the sense of well-being and positivity. I‚Äôve never had mania where I feel so fucking *frightened* before. I‚Äôm seeing my psych in a few weeks but if you guys think I should go sooner I will.

For anyone that might be considering a similar upgrade, here are my first impressions:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†it‚Äôs VERY compact. This is my small little nyc apartment coffee station but it fits here nicely, and takes up less space than the BSG
‚Ä¢	‚Å†it feels extremely premium and well built, this thing is heavy for its size
‚Ä¢	‚Å†it is much quieter than the BSG which I appreciate
‚Ä¢	‚Å†moving to a single dose work flow did not bother me much at all, and rather enjoying it
‚Ä¢	‚Å†the grinds are SO fluffy. It‚Äôs been so much easier to dial in my espresso
‚Ä¢	‚Å†finally, the coffee. the improvement was noticeable almost immediately. I‚Äôm continuing to find tune, but I went from drinking mostly hot and iced americanos, to now enjoying straight espresso much more

Running his finger through the thorny shrubs, the tiny scratches are welcome to Craig‚Äôs pale skin. The plants are poking over ancient brick walls, overflowing from the tastefully unkempt gardens of terraced period properties. The mild pain gives Craig a thrill, reminding him that he is alive in the free world.

This can‚Äôt be the right place though, Craig is thinking, as he shrugs his rucksack back to push the heavy front door with both hands. Solid wood, painted green with brass knobs and letterbox, must be pretty old. The lush red carpet inside seems too royal as it cushions Craig‚Äôs unworthy feet, the fresh wallpaper and paintwork that clothes the ageing walls smartly beam immaculately at his shabby body. Up ahead, a couple of lads with guitar cases spit muffled laughter through tight lips at the front desk, dressed in scruffy old clothes, far from smart - but cool at least.

‚ÄúSo where did he kill her then? You get all the bloodstains out yet?‚Äù the one with long ginger hair asks the short young Asian lad who is welcoming guests to The Bourdan Hotel. He mumbles something back but it‚Äôs too quiet for Craig. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just curious,‚Äù says the other lad, slapping his mate on the back heartily with his right hand and flicking his dirty denim collar up with his left. Craig, getting closer, looks up at the arm cupping in tightly around his mate‚Äôs torso, up toward the hand, fingers digging slightly into the shoulder blade, adorned with black nail varnish. The lad declares, ‚ÄúThis place is a bargain, what a lovely gaff‚Äù.

The place must be Victorian or something, in a nice part of town, but suspiciously cheap enough for the small allowance Craig‚Äôs parole office Carol gave him for a couple of nights‚Äô lodge. Well, it was suspicious - now he knows better, why the heavy discount. The pressure in the place is dropping now that Craig knows its dirty secret, the swollen impressiveness eases and the large healthy houseplants in their ceramic pots seem to wither and clear the last few feet to the front desk for him.

Craig relaxes and feels a half smirk. How fucked up to feel chilled out now you know a murder had just happened where you‚Äôre staying? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù Craig says under his breath and sticks out his chest, his unzipped Under Armour tracksuit top parting slightly as he strides confidently across a luxurious white furry rug up to the check-in desk.

The two lads with guitars are leaving the counter in laughter as Craig pulls up, unnoticed. They look queer buggers as they pick up their backpacks and head for the stairs, Longhair kicking Nail Varnish Boy up the arse. A flash of envy grips Craig though - because, despite being weirdos, these boys are clearly having good crack. He reminds himself he‚Äôs better off in the luxury of finally being alone after too many years, but it‚Äôs hard to convince himself.

‚ÄúYou the boss then?‚Äù Craig always asks that when he arrives, something from childhood that‚Äôs stuck. This young lad definitely doesn‚Äôt look like the gaffer, but you never know, the small quiet ones can surprise you sometimes. ‚ÄúNo sir,‚Äù he‚Äôs not up to much this lad, Indian, short and meek, robotically pattering through the check-in procedure.  Craig breathes the place in, his new place, he considers what he‚Äôs got for himself; a clean, well-kept hotel with a distinct lack of piss stench, very quiet with not a single knackered old wino or screaming nutter banging on the walls. Reassuringly old, built from old Yorkshire bricks and guarded by trees that are much older still. Yep - it‚Äôll be plump pillows, peace and quiet with a few tinnies and the telly. Craig is going to chill out, Craig deserves this.

Stretched right out in bliss, it was nicer than Craig had expected, might be the loveliest bed he‚Äôs ever laid on in fact. A thick, clean, pure white duvet cradles him in an aura of a fresh start - a clean break. Checking with the forefingers on his left hand, Craig‚Äôs first few knuckles on his right still feel a little sore. He thinks back to that flimsy newbuild and he wonders if they had moved that wardrobe yet and found the dent he‚Äôd made in the plasterboard? He was stressed at the time, worried he‚Äôd not be allowed to leave the halfway house if they found it. That was his last outbreak though, Craig is chilled now. You can hardly blame him for that little slipup - how can any man, 22-years-of-age, be cooped up and bossed about like a little boy without lashing out at least once?

A branch taps on the window and Craig rolls to his left to see dusk coming through the wooden frame, the branch is a near-black silhouette against that kind of sky that is a blue both bright and dark and the whole tree shows every tiny bare bit of twig, stripped naked to its complex ancient structure. Craig daydreams of meeting a nice lass tomorrow in town. He‚Äôll go to the market, get a Costa coffee and sit on a bench and she‚Äôll ask to sit next to him. Her pretty face lights up when he says ‚Äúyeah course you can,‚Äù and she sits, dressed nicely but still casual, in tight jeans and an ironed white Lacoste polo shirt, very tasteful. Craig glances down and spies her erect left nipple poking beneath the crocodile logo,  the right one is making itself known too - both of them entirely unfettled by any kind of bra. Then, looking back up, he finds her grinning cutely before turning away, all shy. Craig is on the verge of a wank, but resists like a good lad. A sudden urge swells in his chest - an urge to go out on the lash, but that‚Äôs not for tonight either. Rolling over on his right side, Craig finds the Nike rucksack still on his bed and fishes out the four pack of Fosters. Still a bit cold - beautiful.

At 1.14am Craig is awake, the Fosters is long gone and now the cheap vodka is flowing, topped with a slug from a grey bottle of budget energy drink, a bit warm but drinkable. There‚Äôs not much on terrestrial telly and he‚Äôs too pissed to focus on his tiny phone screen anymore, so Craig gets to his feet and steps in front of the mirror. He could do with a haircut, it‚Äôs nearly over his ears. He‚Äôs almost got a beard as well, definitely looking on the rough side with his milky skin, dark eyes and a face bordering on gaunt. He‚Äôll find a local barbers tomorrow though, he tells himself, and get a tight, fresh new cut to go with his fresh new start.

There‚Äôs heavy footsteps in the corridor and laughter. As Craig opens his door, he sees the back of Nail Varnish Boy a few doors down with a lad in a black leather jacket and old brown boots stomping about. He watches them push each other about a bit, laughing heavily, they look like they‚Äôre having a ball. ‚ÄúNow then lads, had a good night?‚Äù Craig calls out. Both turn around and Craig gives a grin, raising the 70cl bottle of Glen‚Äôs Vodka and widening his eyes. The two boys don‚Äôt return the smile when they turn though, they look fresh faced and a little lost. ‚ÄúYeah mate, you?‚Äù says Nail Varnish Boy. ‚ÄúJust a chilled one for me boys,‚Äù says Craig, giving a little nod to Brown Boots, who‚Äôs got scruffy brown hair, much more overgrown than Craig‚Äôs, ‚ÄúHere, has your buddy been borrowing his lass‚Äôs makeup or what? What‚Äôs that nail varnish about ey?‚Äù Craig asks with a wink. Brown Boots opens his mouth, but nothing comes out as his eyes widen in confusion with a hint of worry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just in a band mate,‚Äù Nail Varnish Boy says, almost apologetically, ‚ÄúIt looks good onstage with the guitar, y‚Äôknow, I don‚Äôt wear it normally.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh yeah, into the old rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll?‚Äù Craig mimics guitar playing, ‚Äúbit of Oasis an‚Äô that? I love all that me.‚Äù ‚ÄúHaha, yeah sound mate,‚Äù says Nail Varnish Boy, his mouth smiling, but the jovialness heard in the corridor less than a minute ago now thoroughly depleted. ‚ÄúSee ya later anyway mate,‚Äù says Brown Boots, waving weakly. ‚ÄúAfter party is it now boys? Any girls coming or what?‚Äù Craig asks as he struts down the corridor towards the young musicians. He‚Äôll show these boys how to party, he thinks, they don‚Äôt seem like much crack afterall and might need a bit of guidance. ‚ÄúNo, no, just to bed mate,‚Äù Brown Boots rushes to say, ‚ÄúYeah, night mate,‚Äù adds Nail Varnish, and with that they turn and walk to their room, leaving Craig deflated.

Craig wakes up starving and sees 9.32am displayed on his cracked phone screen, he thinks of the last time he ate - a ham sandwich and crisps with Coke from Boots around noon the day before. His head is banging and the air in the room feels warm, stale and stinking. As he pushes the duvet off, the weight takes him by surprise and he takes great comfort in remembering where he is. The smile he cracks actually hurts his head. He‚Äôs still dressed in yesterday‚Äôs clothes and remembers breakfast is served until 10am, that should sort him out - he goes straight to the door in search of some scran.

The breakfast room is small and Craig spots catering gear all along units on the right hand wall with the welcome smell of bacon and sausages filling the room. Scanning his surroundings, Craig sees Brown Boots and Longhair eating at a table near the middle but no-one else. There should be plenty of food left if the place is half empty, he supposes, and wonders how much he can get away with eating.

Craig helps himself to a warm white plate and looks down pitifully at the sad mini boxes of Weetabix and Corn Flakes - peasant food - as he passes them on his way to the good stuff. He lifts a steel lid to reveal a dozen or so sausages, lying there, lightly wrinkled, waiting for him like hot parcels of fatty comfort. He tongs seven onto this plate carefully, one-by-one, lining them up diagonally around the top left curve of his plate from eleven O‚Äôclock all the way down to five O‚Äôclock, and moves on to the next station. Three fried eggs, a little crispy round the edge, are added to the top left quadrant, stacked but staggered like a fan of cards, cheering up the plate considerably. Craig sidles along to the next merry-looking container and a lid lift reveals back bacon looking floppy and pink, Craig wants to see a lot more crispiness - this stuff looked like it had been boiled rather than grilled - like miserable warmed up ham. Bacon never tastes bad though, so Craig takes five rashers and stacks them as best as he can in the bottom left quadrant to leave enough room for the finishing touches. He has just two lids left to lift now, both on the same heated catering container, they must be mushrooms and baked beans, those bits that fill in the gaps in the stomach pile and give the meal its hearty satisfaction. The lids are transparent and not quite on properly because they each have a utensil wedging them open, tongs in the left one and a ladle on the right, both steamed up so the contents are hidden from view. He whips off the first to disbelief - nothing but a single cooked mushroom, he whips off the lid to the right and sees it reassuringly filled high with hot baked beans but no more mushrooms to be seen. The floppy bacon could be forgiven as there was plenty of it available, but to have no mushrooms on offer at all really boiled his piss. Turning round, lid in hand, to see if the lads at the table could see the travesty he‚Äôd been struck by, Craig didn‚Äôt seem to earn so much as a glance from them as they sipped coffee and munched away. Craig drops a full ladle of beans into the centre of his plate stroppily - there‚Äôs no point in caring about presentation now, it‚Äôs ruined. Craig eyes up Longhair who‚Äôs casually scrolling on his phone while sipping from a mug. Brown Boots is quite timid, he can be sure of that, but Longhair might have a bit more about him, could be the band‚Äôs leader and Craig had better get the measure of him, so he chucks a couple of slices of white toast on the plate and strides confidently over to their table, pulling out a chair deliberately roughly with his free hand and firmly planting his arse down on it.

Eyes up from Longhair, as he fiddles his fork, Brown Boots stares at his plate, hunched over as he scrapes across some beans with his knife, the black varnish half worn off now, he may have caught a glance of Craig but doesn‚Äôt look up properly

‚ÄúGood night lads?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah decent,‚Äù says Longhair. ‚ÄúYourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh just a quiet one for me, nowt like you lads out on the road with your rock music, bet you‚Äôre partying every night aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah pretty good like, rough as arseholes this morning though.‚Äù

‚ÄúBack on the road in a bit, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, when his lordship drags himself out of bed‚Äù

The pile of mushrooms on Longhair‚Äôs plate catches Craig‚Äôs eye, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve taken all the mushrooms then!‚Äù He shouts, outraged, and shovels half off them onto his own plate with his fork. Longhair looks stunned, mouth agape. Craig eats eyes down now, his shoulder wide, huddled over his food like an owl.

After breakfast, the lads in the band pack up their stuff in the shared room and lug it down the stairs and hear shouting from the foyer. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äôs that?‚Äù asks Nail Varnish. Descending the stairs, they see Craig berating the two desk attendants and Longhair distractedly bangs his guitar on the bannister. Craig notices him, ‚ÄúLend me your phone,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Says Longhair, ‚ÄúPlease let me borrow it, it‚Äôs an emergency,‚Äù Longhair unlocks his phone and hands it over, Craig heads out to the front garden with it. ‚ÄúHas he nicked that - what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Longhair asks at the desk, to the same Indian lad who greeted them. ‚ÄúWe have had some trouble with this guest,‚Äù he explains.

Craig storms back in, ‚ÄúThis is absolutely outrageous,‚Äù he shouts, voice breaking slightly as he thrusts the phone back into Longhair‚Äôs hand. 

‚ÄòMr. Kelly, your room, you have created so much damage. You must pay for the repair Mr. Kelly, you must pay us ¬£750, just a small part of the cost, we will take it from your card.‚Äô

‚ÄòNo, you‚Äôre robbing me, this is wrong, you can‚Äôt take that money from me, that‚Äôs all of it.‚Äô

‚ÄòIt is the minimum Mr. Connor, the cleaning bill alone for the urine stains, it will be hundreds, you must pay.‚Äô

*

He‚Äôd trashed it. He‚Äôd hurled each piece of furniture he could lift, flung the little wooden chair at the opposite wall, plaster smashed, showing clear damage, but not enough, the bedsheets had to be ripped, the poxy posh things, mocking him for his poor past, a plush pisstake of a fine fabric he‚Äôd never felt before.

I did nowt wrong, I always knew it, but I got soft when I was insside - I listened to the twisted words of that pastor, the counsellor, that fucking bitch Carol, they hadn‚Äôt heard her lies, they weren‚Äôt there, they didn‚Äôt see how she was with me, a pisstaker, mean, cruel, putting herself above me when she had no right, no fucking right at all.

The chair was stamped the same way his dad stamped on him, cracking, coming apart, useless now, never to be sat on again. Curtains ripped down of course, easy work, nowhere to hide now. The wall could fuck off an‚Äô all, punching the hole bigger, fist bloodied, wrist weakened, a fucking disaster - his first weekend. The fragile lamps ripped from their fitting with a crack and tear, mock brass bent with a bounce off the shelf. He beat all purpose out of the room.

I‚Äôm a proper fucking man, they had no right putting me in a cage.

He‚Äôd kicked the bed, but it was heavy and big and barely budged, stronger, more expensive than him.  To repay the disrespect, he slipped down the elasticated waste of his tracksuit bottoms, whipped out his most trusty weapon and pissed all over the thing, bedding and all, it was fancy things, but only things, bits of dead tree, dead cotton, dirty plastic, he was better than that - at least he was alive. 

Three fucking years, what a waste. 

The soft pathetic room humiliated by his power. The old window pulled up, jamming in its swollen frame as it became big enough for Craig to slip his little body out of. The tree offered its embrace as Craig leapt towards it, gripped and pulled his way towards its trunk, twigs snapping and scratching his skin, welcome pain, man and nature, how it should be. At 2am he squatted between its strongest two offshoots, the original split, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in reality now son,‚Äù the tree whispered, ‚Äúthat world of lies will never hold you down‚Äù. Craig looked in on the lit up room, destroyed and meaningless.

I‚Äôm out now. I‚Äôm free.

*

He lunges, a woman screams, Craig grabs at the desk lad‚Äôs neck but feels his arm gripped, he‚Äôs twisted round and soon on the ground, ‚ÄúRemain still, the Police are coming‚Äù, says Amir, dutifully holding down the unruly guest. ‚ÄúGet the fuck off me now, get off, you fucking bastard,‚Äù the three band lads look amazed, slightly scared but also amused - they‚Äôve just gained a great tour story to tell.

Craig settled under Amir‚Äôs bodyweight, he could feel his warmth, hear his heartbeat and smell his sweat. He submitted completely.

When the police came, Craig was almost catatonic as Amir got off him and the officers attached the cuffs. I‚Äôll never be free, not in this world, escorted back out the green door, down the steps and  onto the pavement beyond the gate, where people craned their head as they walked to work, he looked up at the tree, swaying majestically, it whispered something in the breeze, Craig couldn‚Äôt make it out, but felt shame as the branches gestured imperiously.  The copper pushed down his head and he slid onto the back seat - that familiar place, almost safe. He thought of the woman he‚Äôd hurt.

The band was stood on the doorstep with a few of the staff and a couple of other guests, watching the police car roll away and Amir was being congratulated for his bravery. ‚ÄúI started training two years ago, after the murder here, you know, in case I needed it‚Äù, ‚ÄúWell you certainly did‚Äù.

The boys descend the steps as the police car engine fires up, edging closer to try to catch a last glimpse of Craig. ‚ÄúWho did he ring?‚Äù Nail Varnish asks Longhair. ‚ÄúYeah, should‚Äôve mentioned that to the coppers,‚Äù  realises Brown Boots. ‚ÄùHe might have rang someone to come and cause some trouble.‚Äù Longhair unlocked his phone to check, ‚ÄúFucking hell,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Brown Boot. ‚ÄúHe rang 999.‚Äù

1nf1xhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nf1xhg/almost_been_a_year_and_i_still_miss_them/,Almost been a year and I still miss them,"My ex and I were together for 5 years, and it was my first queer and serious relationship in my adult life. We broke up in December 2024.

We had moved in together after two years, and got a cat on the 4th year. I imagined marrying them, infact I was going to propose on our 5th anniversary. I imagined growing old with them. They were the first person I truly loved. 

Our relationship wasn‚Äôt perfect of course. As some backstory, we discussed opening our relationship to explore our sexuality and try things we couldn‚Äôt provide eachother. This was fine, for maybe a month or two. I had fallen for another girl as well,  and they had even started falling for the boy they were talking to. We started dating those other people, all of this was communicated between us and there was no cheating or lying between us. Anyways, two-ish months later they sat me down and broke it off with me. Explaining that they ‚Äúfinally found someone who treats them as they deserve to be loved.‚Äù At the time, I was having libido issues due to medication and unsolved personal issues, but it‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt want to sleep with them. I just did not have the drive, and this upset them very much. They told me it felt like I wasn‚Äôt attracted to them etc when i physically did not feel like sex/even think about it. I did try to work on it. It was a complicated issue and I believe we are both at fault here. 

We planned to keep the break up civil, and stay friends. We would stay living together but have seperate bedrooms. This we all good for about a month until I was fired from my job, and I could not afford the rent. I was distraught. I was a mess. I went cold turkey off my meds and ended up in the psych ward for a week. I was terrible to my ex, snapping and swearing at them. I never once threatened violence or hurt them physically. But they were scared of what I had become. I was too and I felt like my life was so out of control and that I didn‚Äôt know what to live for anymore. I moved out about a month later, stayed with a family friend for about 6 months. I now live with my old highschool friend and I‚Äôm more stable. We are no contact and have not spoken since February. 

But I still cry about them. I still think of them. I can‚Äôt listen to certain songs or watch certain shows without the risk of upsetting myself. Last night I had the most vivid and cruel dream of them taking me back and understanding and loving me again. I often dream of them and hearing about them through friends etc sends me into a mini panic. I just want to talk to them. I feel like I don‚Äôt have closure. I want to apologise for how terrible I was, and how happy they made me and thank them for helping me become the person I am today. 

I‚Äôve considered writing them a letter explaining all this, and offering meeting up for coffee one last time as a proper, nice goodbye so I can finally move on but I know this is selfish and I know they have very negative feelings towards me due to how nasty and unstable I was. Writing a letter I think would be selfish and hurt them. But I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôm so sick of thinking of them, crying over them, when they probably don‚Äôt even think about me, ever. 

I‚Äôm still with that girl I fell for and she‚Äôs been very supportive of me throughout this breakup- but it‚Äôs so unfair that I can‚Äôt love her fully and give her my 100% because I‚Äôm still stuck in the past. I don‚Äôt want to be, I want to be better. I don‚Äôt know what to do and this was just a rant. Any advice would be helpful, please be kind.

# Club‚Äôs purpose is enjoyment But there‚Äôs worthy sideline

Pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters clink into a glass jar at every meeting of the Four Corner Club of Nasewaupee. It is earmarked for the Door County Memorial hospital and when the fund reaches $25.00 it is presented. Ot course, it takes years to meet the quota for the club meets nine times a year and the membership is limited to 16 ladies.

The hospital donation campaign was started in December 1962 when Imogene Meredith was en¬≠tertaining the group at her home for the Christmas meeting. Imo¬≠gene is one of the hospital staff and interested in revenue for maintaining the worthy edifice.

‚ÄúHow about passing a jar for coins for the new hospital?‚Äù she said, and when the idea caught it didn‚Äôt take her long to empty her husband‚Äôs jar of shaving cream (it was almost empty), find a ham¬≠mer and chisel, cut an opening in the cover, insert a coin and the project was on its way.

The first $25 was given in May 1964 with $1.60 left over. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs use it for seed for the next $25.00,‚Äù Imogene said, and it was reached in 1966. But the ladies decided on a different donation when Jeanette Schmidtke, who worked as an aid at the hospital, said there was a need for a small set of dishes to be used at night on the patient floor. ‚ÄúThe kitchen is locked for the night,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúand no dishes are available for patients who are admitted late and ask for a snack to eat. Even the nurses haven‚Äôt a cup for coffee.‚Äù

The club members authorized Mrs. Meredith to gain permission from the administration to pur¬≠chase dishes for the upper floor and it was granted. Before Christmas the dishes were in use by the appreciative night staff of the hospital. Meanwhile the coins keep filling the former shave cream jar until the third $25 has been reached. This time it‚Äôs going for the new Extended Care Facility.

The Four Corner club is observing its 42nd year since its organization in 1926. Of the 20 ladies who joined that first year only one member, Mrs. Herman Roder, is still active.

The social club was the brain¬≠-child of Mrs. Philip Mann (de¬≠ceased 1953), who started it as an afternoon gathering of neighbor ladies within walking distance of each other‚Äôs farmhouses, a radius of less than a mile from the intersection of County Trunk C and M ‚Äî hence the name Four Corner club.

Ladies present at that first meeting at the home of Mrs. Mann (now the Wallace Mann property) were the Mmes. Herman Hembel, George Hembel, John Schinktgen, Henry Schinktgen, Herman Kath, Miss Nell Cunningham and Mrs. Frank Conrad. Within the next few months and years the fol¬≠lowing joined: Mrs. Con Jensen, Mrs. Herman Roder, Mrs. Joe Dufek, Mrs. Geo. Graf, Mrs. John Schulties, Mrs. Fred Schulties, Mrs. Otto Oldenburg, Mrs. Henry Oldenburg, Mrs. Julius Kath, Mrs. Louis Cochenet, Mrs. Joe Mohr, Mrs. Fred Sperber, Miss Anna Schinktgen and Mrs. Joe Tesar.

Through the years the enroll¬≠ment changed due to death, relocation, illness and conflicting duties. In its 42 years there has been a total of 47 members but never more than 22 on the roll at one time. The present limit of 16 members allows the hostess room for invited guests.

The club has maintained its purely social status ‚Äî no sewing projects, no study units, no arts, crafts, politics, or even fancy work and mending. Its original purpose was to provide farm women an opportunity to visit with their neighbors once a month to enjoy small talk and a lunch and coffee together. But its monthly dues and donations enable the club to donate regularly to the local drives such as Cancer, United Fund, March of Dimes, and Cerebral Palsy. Gifts and cards for the sick members are provided and flowers for the bereaved.

The present roll call contains a cross section of the town of Nasewaupee with a few spilled over the line into West Sturgeon Bay. Enrolled are Mrs. Herman Roder, Mrs. Sylvester Roder, Mrs. Carl Roder, Mrs. Darwin Schmidtke, Mrs. John Lopas, Mrs. George Meredith, Mrs. George Vyvyan, Mrs. Wallace Mann, Mrs. George Weckler, Mrs. Henry Weckler, Mrs. John Weckler, Mrs. Fred Peterson, Mrs. George Wiesner, Mrs. Virgil Ash, Mrs. Grant Hanson and Mrs. Floyd Wetak.

The club celebrated its 25th anniversary in May 1951 with a banquet at Samuelson‚Äôs restaurant in Sturgeon Bay. Five years later it repeated the celebration at the same place. For the 35th a Mother-Daughter banquet was held and several Christmas banquets over the years.

Some of the members winter in Florida or California but in the spring their return is heralded at the meeting of the Four Corner club. And they never complain when they pay their back dues.

1nf1jzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nf1jzc/the_333_meetings/,The 3:33 Meetings,"
Every morning at 3:33 AM, they gather in my basement.

I‚Äôve been living in grandmother‚Äôs house for six months now, ever since the funeral. Ever since the lawyers handed me keys to a place I‚Äôd visited maybe three times as a kid. Ever since I lost my job, my apartment, and what little family I had left to a year that seemed determined to strip everything away.

The house sits on Maple Street in one of those neighborhoods where everyone knows everyone, where casseroles appear on doorsteps when someone dies, where people still leave their doors unlocked. At least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

*Step, step, step.* The sound of feet on my basement stairs.

It started the first week. I‚Äôd lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, when I‚Äôd hear the unmistakable creak of the basement door opening. Then footsteps‚Äîcareful, deliberate, multiple sets‚Äîdescending into the space below. At first I convinced myself it was settling. Old houses make noise, especially in winter. The heating system groans, the wood contracts, pipes tick their metallic lullabies.

But houses don‚Äôt whisper.

*Come now, come now, come.*

I‚Äôd grab the baseball bat grandmother kept beside her bed and creep down the hallway, heart hammering against my ribs. But every time I checked, the basement door was locked. The deadbolt I‚Äôd installed myself was turned tight. The stairs beyond lay empty in the moonlight filtering through the high windows.

Still, the whispers continued. Muffled voices rising through the floorboards like steam from some underground prayer meeting. I‚Äôd press my ear to the hardwood and catch fragments‚Äîwords that sounded like confessions, like testimonies, like the kind of sharing that happens in church basements and community centers when people gather to heal.

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

The neighbors were strange about it when I asked. Mrs. Patterson next door would get this look when I mentioned the sounds‚Äînot confusion, but something else. Something careful. ‚ÄúYour grandmother,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, ‚Äúshe helped a lot of people. Had a gift for it. Made space for folks who needed‚Ä¶ support.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of support?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe kind you can‚Äôt get during regular hours.‚Äù

Mr. Hendricks from across the street was more direct. ‚ÄúSome things don‚Äôt stop just because the sun comes up, son. Pain doesn‚Äôt punch a time clock. Grief doesn‚Äôt respect visiting hours.‚Äù He‚Äôd glanced at my grandmother‚Äôs house with something that looked almost like reverence. ‚ÄúShe understood that.‚Äù

*Step, step, step.* Always the same rhythm.

I started staying awake, waiting. Three weeks in, I finally worked up the courage to hide in the closet under the stairs at 3:30 AM, where I could see the basement door through the slats. At 3:33 exactly, the deadbolt turned by itself. The door swung open on hinges that never made a sound when I used them, but whispered like wind through leaves when they opened.

They came through my kitchen door first. I heard the soft snick of the lock turning, saw flashlight beams dance across the walls. But it wasn‚Äôt the hard white light of intruders‚Äîit was warm, golden, the kind that doesn‚Äôt hurt tired eyes.

Seven people. Different ages, different backgrounds, but all carrying something that weighed heavy on their shoulders. A woman in scrubs who moved like she‚Äôd worked a double shift. A man with paint-stained fingers and hollow cheeks. A teenager whose backpack looked like it held everything she owned. An elderly gentleman using a walker, each step careful and measured.

*Ring, ring, ring.* The soft chime of something metallic.

They descended my basement stairs like they‚Äôd done it a thousand times before. Like this was their space, their sanctuary, their cathedral made of concrete and shadows. I waited until I couldn‚Äôt hear their footsteps anymore, then crept to the basement door.

The stairs had changed.

Not physically‚Äîthe wood was still scarred where grandmother had dragged her Christmas boxes up and down for decades. The handrail still wobbled at the third step. But something felt different. Warmer. Like the space below had been transformed by intention, by ritual, by the simple act of people gathering with purpose.

*Come now, come now, come.*

I descended into my own basement and found it full of light.

They‚Äôd strung small electric candles from the ceiling joists‚Äîthe kind churches use during evening services, the kind that won‚Äôt burn down a building but still cast everything in gold. Folding chairs arranged in a circle. A coffee pot plugged into the outlet by the water heater, the smell of fresh brew mixing with the scent of vanilla and lavender from candles placed on upturned crates.

The walls were covered in photographs.

Hundreds of them. Polaroids and phone prints and formal portraits, all showing faces at different stages of something‚Äîgrief, recovery, transformation. Some were before and after shots. Others captured moments of breakthrough, of connection, of healing caught in the act. In the center of the largest wall, a photo of my grandmother surrounded by dozens of people, all of them holding small silver bells.

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

‚ÄúShe saved my life,‚Äù said a voice behind me.

I spun around to find the woman in scrubs, her face kind but tired in a way that spoke of years spent caring for others. ‚ÄúThree years ago, I was working ICU during the worst of the pandemic. Lost more patients in six months than I had in the previous ten years combined. Started drinking to sleep, then drinking to wake up, then drinking to exist.‚Äù

She gestured to the photos on the wall. ‚ÄúFound out about the meetings through my neighbor. Thought it was some kind of cult at first‚Äîwho meets at 3:33 AM? But Margaret explained it was the only time that worked for everyone. Night shift workers, insomniacs, people whose pain doesn‚Äôt respect business hours. People who needed a place to gather when the rest of the world was asleep.‚Äù

*Step, step, step.* More feet on the stairs.

The others joined us‚Äîthe painter with his hollow cheeks, the teenager with her overstuffed backpack, the elderly man with his walker. Each took their place in the circle of chairs like they were returning home after a long journey.

‚ÄúI lost my son,‚Äù said the painter, his voice steady but soft. ‚ÄúCar accident. Couldn‚Äôt paint for two years. Couldn‚Äôt see color anymore, couldn‚Äôt see the point. Margaret found me on the bridge at 3 AM one night, not quite ready to jump but not quite ready to climb down either.‚Äù

The teenager spoke next. ‚ÄúMy parents kicked me out when I came out. Been living in shelters and friends‚Äô couches for eight months. Someone at the youth center told me about the meetings. Said there were people here who understood what it meant to lose family.‚Äù

The elderly man adjusted his walker and smiled. ‚ÄúLost my wife of fifty-seven years last spring. Haven‚Äôt slept through the night since. Doctor wants to give me pills, but pills don‚Äôt cure loneliness. These folks do.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.* The soft chime again.

Each person held a small silver bell‚Äîthe kind used in meditation, in prayer, in moments of remembering. ‚ÄúWe ring them for the people we‚Äôve lost,‚Äù the nurse explained. ‚ÄúFor the parts of ourselves we‚Äôve had to let go. For the hope we‚Äôre trying to find again.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why here?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy my grandmother‚Äôs basement?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause she understood,‚Äù said a new voice.

I turned to see a woman about my mother‚Äôs age descending the stairs, carrying a thermos and a bag of what smelled like homemade cookies. ‚ÄúMargaret lost her husband when your mom was just ten. Raised her alone while working two jobs and fighting her own battles with depression. She knew what it meant to feel invisible, to struggle when everyone else was asleep.‚Äù

She began setting up supplies‚Äîtissues, notebooks, more of those small electric candles. ‚ÄúShe started the meetings twenty years ago. Just her and Mrs. Patterson, talking through their grief over coffee at her kitchen table. Word spread quietly, the way these things do. People who needed help finding people who could give it.‚Äù

*Come now, come now, come.*

‚ÄúThe time is specific,‚Äù the painter continued. ‚Äú3:33. Sacred numbers in some traditions, but for us it just meant the deep night, when defenses are down and truth comes easier. When the world is quiet enough to hear each other, really hear.‚Äù

They began to sit, and something in their posture invited me to join them. I took a chair between the nurse and the teenager, my hands shaking slightly as I accepted the small silver bell someone pressed into my palm.

‚ÄúWe start with the bells,‚Äù the elderly man explained. ‚ÄúThree rings for what we‚Äôve lost. Then we share‚Äîwhatever needs sharing. No judgment, no advice unless it‚Äôs asked for, no rushing toward solutions. Just witness.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.*

The sound filled the basement, each bell adding its voice to a chorus that seemed to transform the concrete walls into something sacred. I thought of my grandmother, of the job I‚Äôd lost, of sitting alone in this house for months feeling like I was disappearing.

‚ÄúI inherited this house,‚Äù I heard myself saying, ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt know how to live in it. Don‚Äôt know how to live anywhere, really. Everything fell apart this year and I can‚Äôt figure out how to put it back together.‚Äù

Nods around the circle. No one tried to fix me or offer platitudes. They just listened as I talked about loneliness, about feeling like I was failing at being human, about lying awake at 3 AM wondering if anyone would notice if I just stopped trying.

‚ÄúThe insomnia‚Äôs the worst part,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the darkness amplifies everything wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we meet in it,‚Äù said the woman with the cookies. ‚ÄúTo prove the darkness isn‚Äôt empty. To show it can hold community just as easily as despair.‚Äù

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

One by one, they shared their stories. The nurse talked about learning to see death as transition rather than failure. The painter described the first time he‚Äôd been able to see color again‚Äîhow it happened gradually, like dawn breaking, and how the meetings had been his lighthouse through the dark hours.

The teenager spoke about chosen family, about how the meetings had taught her that love doesn‚Äôt always come from the people who share your DNA. The elderly man talked about his wife, but also about discovering that grief and gratitude could coexist, that missing someone could become a form of loving them.

*Step, step, step.* The rhythm of healing.

‚ÄúYour grandmother,‚Äù said the woman with the cookies, ‚Äúshe had a theory about 3:33 AM. Said it was the hour when the veil between struggling and healing was thinnest. When people were most ready to be honest about what they needed.‚Äù

She pulled out a photo‚Äîgrandmother surrounded by what must have been fifty people, all holding their bells, all with expressions of peace I‚Äôd never seen in daylight gatherings. ‚ÄúShe called it the Hour of Sacred Insomnia. Time set aside for people whose healing couldn‚Äôt wait for business hours.‚Äù

The meetings, I learned, had been happening in this basement for two decades. Rotating leadership, evolving membership, but always the same purpose: creating space for people to not be okay in the company of others who understood.

*Ring, ring, ring.* For what we‚Äôve lost.

‚ÄúBut also,‚Äù said the nurse, raising her bell again, ‚Äúfor what we‚Äôve found.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.* For what we‚Äôve gained.

The painter joined in. ‚ÄúFor the strength we discovered we had.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.* For unexpected resilience.

The teenager: ‚ÄúFor chosen family.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.* For love that appears in darkness.

The elderly man: ‚ÄúFor the privilege of having had something worth grieving.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.* For depth of connection.

‚ÄúFor this basement,‚Äù I said, surprising myself, ‚Äúand for inheriting more than I knew.‚Äù

*Ring, ring, ring.* For sacred inheritance.

They stayed until nearly dawn, these night-shift healers, these sacred insomniacs. As they prepared to leave, each person hugged me‚Äînot the perfunctory embraces of social obligation, but the full-body connections of people who‚Äôd shared truth in the dark.

‚ÄúNext week?‚Äù asked the nurse.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll put on the coffee,‚Äù I said.

*Come now, come now, come.*

That was six months ago. The meetings continue every morning at 3:33 AM. The membership changes‚Äîpeople heal and graduate, new people find us through whispered recommendations, through the quiet network of night-shift workers and fellow insomniacs who understand that some churches meet in basements and some prayers happen after midnight.

I‚Äôve learned to sleep again, mostly. But I still wake at 3:30, still make coffee, still light the electric candles my grandmother left carefully stored in boxes marked ‚ÄúFor the Meetings.‚Äù I‚Äôve added my own photos to the walls‚Äîsnapshots of breakthrough moments, of laughter shared in a basement at 4 AM, of people learning to carry their grief without being crushed by it.

The neighbors still nod knowingly when delivery trucks ask about the coffee deliveries, the steady stream of quiet visitors, the warm golden light visible through the basement windows in the deepest part of the night. Mrs. Patterson brings homemade cookies every few weeks. Mr. Hendricks stops by to check that our space heater is working properly, that we have enough supplies.

‚ÄúYour grandmother would be proud,‚Äù he told me last week. ‚ÄúShe knew the meetings would continue. Knew someone would step up to keep the space sacred.‚Äù

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

I understand now what grandmother left me. Not just a house, but a purpose. Not just inherited grief, but inherited healing. Not just isolation, but a template for creating community in the spaces where community is needed most.

Every morning at 3:33 AM, they gather in my basement. People who‚Äôve learned that darkness can hold light, that night-shift healing is healing nonetheless, that the hour when most people sleep can be the hour when others learn to live again.

*Step, step, step.* The sound of people coming home.

And I make the coffee, light the candles, and ring my bell three times‚Äîfor what I lost, for what I found, and for the sacred inheritance of understanding that healing, like grief, doesn‚Äôt punch a time clock.

The meetings will continue. In this basement, in these dark hours, in the company of people brave enough to gather when the rest of the world sleeps. Because someone needs to tend the lighthouse. Someone needs to prove that 3:33 AM can be an hour of hope instead of despair.

*Ring, ring, ring.*

I thrive on banter that bites, ideas that shouldn‚Äôt be attempted (but will be anyway), and adventures that end in either epic stories or plausible deniability. Coffee is my co-pilot. Fragile egos? I don‚Äôt resuscitate. Rules? Decorative. Consequences? Negotiable. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: Side effects of hanging out with me may include a skewed sense of reality, inconvenient levels of joy, and an alarming comfort with chaos.

So let‚Äôs start here:

I‚Äôm in the EST time zone so it‚Äôs easier if you are too. Very SFW. Just looking for a solid chat buddy. I‚Äôm curious by nature and can talk about pretty much anything as long as it‚Äôs respectful. I‚Äôm into most music but really love the 80s. If you have good taste send me a Spotify link and I‚Äôll play it while I‚Äôm at work.

Some of the things I‚Äôm into are wrenching on cars, 3D printing, design, restoring engines, watching GT racing, autocross, drinking coffee, and keeping up with the news. Just don‚Äôt ghost. Hopefully this builds into regular voice chats.
