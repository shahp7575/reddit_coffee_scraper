I recently got a frank green bottle as a gift, i seriously loved it because it had my name engraved on it. It started peeling off and got several dents at the bottom. Then I saw that they have started selling something to cover off the dents at the bottom. Why is no one talking about this. It's a complete rip off. I had it for 6 months and I replaced it with an Amazon product. No dents no scratch yet on my Amazon flask. The only thing I liked about Frank green are the metallic straws. My gift came with a coffee cup which was steel - no peel off or dents on that. ",1,1738117774.0,AskAnAustralian,1,1.0,False

We are currently in Las Vegas and looking to move somewhere that is still warm but closer to some family. We are originally from the Midwest ( MN & OH) and preferred the edges of big to mid sized cities. Our goal would be to have a house and a little land 1 acre+ for under 300k with a goal of growing lots of our own food and having space to do our own thing.

We make about $100k combined a year and his job is available to go remote but I would be getting a new job hopefully as I am grossly underpaid in the nonprofit world.

We don’t have kids or plans for any currently and are used to pretty purple areas politically. 

We love being hiking and exploring nature as well as trying local coffee shops and restaurants. Coming from Vegas we don’t need anything close to the night life here but something would be nice.

We have been looking at Charlotte & Raleigh, Huntsville, or Louisville & Lexington based off of where our family is but we would love some suggestions!

I just wanted to share my latest app for flocating coffee shops anywhere in the world. I built it as a part of a December hackathon to build an app and have it on the stores in under a month. Where's the Beans? was my submission, and it has really taken off! You can instantly see the closest coffee shops, search on the map, or search by city anywhere in the world. Once you visit a shop, you can generate a custom stamp and save it to your collection. These images use the Dalle image generation API. Very soon they will have the background removed using the ML Subject segmentation built into android.

Let me know what you think of the app!
I love seeing all the new shops people generate stamps for.

Ive struck out before of course, but this time feels the worst because i cannot understand what i did to deserve this treatment. My friends even notice that shes acting differently with me and me alone. If im in the area she'll actively acknowledge my friends with a smile but ignore me.

1icjaju,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1icjaju/a_hungry_girls_guide_to_not_being_hungry_all_the/,A hungry girl's guide to not being hungry all the GD time.,"I keep seeing posts about how to manage hunger from people starting out, so I thought I would write down my tips as someone who LOVES food and is always hungry. I've been on this journey for about 8 months now, and things are going great, but damn - this shit is hard! 

1. First is accepting that you will be hungry. There is just no way around it. However, I found that I select a part of my day to be hungry. For me it's the morning. I know I'm gonna be super hungry from 8am-noon. For some reason it helps ""Scheduling"" my hunger. So I will eat a very small breakfast of 100cal (an egg and a mushroom) and just deal until lunch. 

2. Everyone advises to eat a shit ton of veg and fruits... sure, but this just cant fill me up. (Also, I only really like lots of raw veg in the summer) However, if I add just 15-20g of a nice fancy cheese to an apple, the fats and protein help me feel way more satiated and it only adds about 30 extra calories. 

3. Glucose spikes mess me up and make me feel way more hungry than I am. The Glucose Goddess is awesome for her 4 rules. And I can honestly say, they work: Do 10 mins of exercise after a meal, eat a savoury breakfast, eat your carbs with protein and fats, eat the fiber first on your plate. 

4. Home cooking. I have an Italian Sausage Soup recipe that I make and it's 150 - 200cal per bowl. And it's FILLING. I bake these muffins that are great treats, and when I compare calories to a muffin in a coffee shop it's crazy. Mine are 180cal per muffin, the coffee shops is 450cal!! I can literally eat 2× the food and still be winning. I cook EVERYTHING. I eat out about 1-2 times per month. (I used to eat out a lot. It's a big change, but ultimately worth it, especially if you're a big ol foodie girl like me and want to eat an entire wheel of cheese) 

5. When life gets really tough, just accept that you gotta eat your maintenance for a couple days. The rest from hunger will help you not get burnt out. 

6. Weirdly a really hard one: Just stop eating chips. Like no chips. Or other little munchie things. Eat a snack that has a real beginning and end.

7. Beans. I got into buying dried beans and not only is it crazy cheap, but also super filling. I traded out pasta for beans and I'm so into it. 

8. Everytime you have a meal or snack, drink water. Wait 20 mins at least before gauging your hunger.

9. My final tip: Be really busy. Like start a hobby. Something that keeps your hands and mind focused. Knitting, drawing, any kind of crafting, cycling, hiking, whatever. The more you're doing during the day, the less you will be thinking about eating. Or even if you are hungry, it helps you not ruminate on it, and keeps your hands out of the snacks. 

These are things that worked well for me! If you guys have any other tips I wanna hear them cause hunger is something I really struggle with, and I'm always curious what weird quirks work for other people. :)

Today is the perfect example; he woke up an hour early (6 am.)

Then, the unthinkable happened! Dad had to go to work! And then, I made EGGS instead of pancakes!! And so ensued a 50 minute tantrum from hell. Like I seriously was like WTF is this??? He sounded like a wild animal. It was the craziest thing I have ever seen. He was begging to go in my baby wrap, throwing toys blah blah blah. I felt terrible but I had to start getting him ready for daycare against his will for the first time ever and I felt so guilty. He eventually settled again and happily got in the car for daycare! Then he arrived to daycare and decided he didn’t want to go anymore! Blah blah blah. It all worked out.

We go to dance class on tuesdays. I skipped it tonight because I didn’t have it in me to endure the fight to get dressed and go, then the fight to leave and come back home.

Her mom walks in and says, ""Dee Dee, you shouldn't watch this. You know scary movies freak you out.""

""What do you mean I shouldn't watch this?"" Dee Dee asks. ""Scary movies don't always freak me out.""

However, she later shakes in fear in bed, wondering if everyone she knows is a robot. She decides he has nothing to worry about and tries to get some sleep, but she has a nightmare about the same robot from the movie chasing her.

The next day at PS38, Dee Dee has become very paranoid and believes that robots are ""everywhere"" with every sound jump-scaring her.

Meanwhile, Principal Nichols is in his office, listening to a robotic techno song on his portable radio. He thinks out loud, ""Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music.""

Dee Dee is still paranoid when she hears someone call her name that makes her scream. It was Nate! He says, ""There you are, Dee Dee! C'mon, we're gonna be late for homeroom.""

""Oh!"" Dee Dee exclaims. ""Right. Homeroom. Of course. Sorry Nate, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. Pretty funny, huh?""

Nate sarcastically scoffs, ""Hilarious. Let's go.""

When they enter homeroom, Dee Dee greets Mrs. Godfrey, ""Good morning, Mrs. Godfrey! ...Say, you're not a robot, are you?""

""No, I'm not,"" Mrs. Godfrey responds, confused.

""Well, keep your eyes peeled,"" Dee Dee lowers her voice. ""They're everywhere.""

Mrs. Godfrey shrugs her shoulders and points to Dee Dee's seat. ""Just sit down please.""

Later, while walking out of homeroom, Dee Dee overhears Principal Nichols in his office saying, ""I feel completely recharged!""

""That sounds like Principal Nichols,"" Dee Dee thinks, peeking through the door opened slightly ajar.

""Come on, little buddy, play it again,"" Principal Nichols begs to the radio. ""Please? One more time, for me.""

Dee Dee is worried that Principal Nichols might be a robot, but she brushes aside that worry. She then overhears Principal Nichols calling a radio station and saying, ""Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.""

""Hmmm... which one, man?"" asks the radio DJ on the other line.

""The one that goes bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.""

""No, man. You're thinking of bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop.""

""Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop...""

The robot noises make Dee Dee even more worried, but again she brushes aside that worry. She peeks into the office once again and gasps. Principal Nichols is doing a bizarre robot-like dance to the song. That's enough to convince her!

She runs to Nate, stammering, ""Oh, Nate, it's terrible! Principal Nichols... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!""

Nate responds, ""That's great, Dee Dee. Why don't you work on this problem later? We don't wanna be late for our next class!""

""I'm serious, Nate! Principal Nichols is a robot. And I can prove it, too.""

During each interval between classes, Dee Dee tries several tests to prove that Principal Nichols is a robot. First, she tests Principal Nichols' sense of humor by having Nate tell a joke, but Principal Nichols does not laugh.

Dee Dee gasps, ""Not even a chuckle! See, Nate? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's a robot!""

There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, Dee Dee,"" Nate says. ""He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Principal Nichols is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie.""

Dee Dee then tests Principal Nichols' emotions by telling him, ""Nate's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?""

""Yes, I suppose that is rather sad,"" Principal Nichols responds, ""but Nate can hug himself during lunch break! Now get to class!""

Dee Dee turns to Nate and says, ""Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.""

Nate is getting annoyed. ""Dee Dee, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!""

This reminds Dee Dee of the third and final test: the love test, in which she tells Principal Nichols, ""I just wanted to tell you that Nate loves you!""

Principal Nichols makes a blank expression on his face and says, ""Just go to class, you two.""

Back in his office, Principal Nichols' radio breaks and he decides that he will give the batteries to her niece Noelle for her Christmas present. A timer rings, and he grabs a pair of tongs and removes his hard-boiled egg from a pot of boiling water, ready to eat it for his lunch break. But just when Principal Nichols is about to put some salt on the egg, he is startled when Dee Dee calls out his name again, and he accidentally tosses the full saltshaker into his eyes, causing him to scream in pain.

""Will you be quiet!?"" Nate asks Dee Dee. ""Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?""

She explains, ""Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.""

""Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?!""

Suddenly, Principal Nichols barges into the cafetorium that they are in, screaming in pain with glowing bloodshot eyes, the tongs he used to hold the egg, and the radio batteries in his pocket. After Principal Nichols runs to the bathroom, Nate and Dee Dee look at each other and scream, ""ROBOT!!!""

""Let's go to Mrs. Shipulski's office and ask her to spread the word about the robot invasion!"" Nate says.

He and Dee Dee run to Mrs. Shipulski's office, but she's not there. A note is left on her desk saying, ""Out sick today. Will be back later.""

Dee Dee gasps, ""Nate, the robots captured Mrs. Shipulski and forced her to write that note!""

""Not Mrs. Shipulski!"" Nate turns on the intercom. ""Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! Our world!""

All the students and teachers run out of the school. Yes, teachers, they fear robots too! The only people still in the school are Nate, Dee Dee, and Principal Nichols, the latter starting to enter the room Nate and Dee Dee are in. They hide behind Mrs. Shipulski's desk as Principal Nichols, relieved that his eyes are not hurting anymore, goes back to his office, not noticing that PS38 is now empty.

Nate tries to come up with a plan. ""We need to find out what that robot did with the real Principal Nichols, but how?""

""Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot,"" Dee Dee explains.

""They poop on the robot?""

""Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.""

""I never thought I'd say this but, Dee Dee, let's get that poop!""

Nate and Dee Dee go to the supply closet, where Dee Dee grabs some rope while Nate grabs a hammer and a saw. Then the two go into Principal Nichols' office and attack him, with Nate tying him to his chair.

""NATE! DEE DEE!"" Principal Nichols shouts. ""What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!""

""Shut up!"" Nate slaps him.

""Sweet cheese, what the heck is going on?!""

Nate slaps him again. ""I said shut up, you bucket of bolts!""

""I can't take it!"" Dee Dee runs off crying.

""Dee Dee, are you okay?"" Nate asks her.

""Oh, Dee Dee, seeing you slap Principal Nichols like that is just too horrible to watch!""

""No, that's not Principal Nichols. That's Robot Nichols.""

""Oh, yeah.""

""And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.""

""Right.""

Nate and Dee Dee continue slapping Principal Nichols demanding to know where the ""real"" Principal Nichols is, but he still insists that he is the real Principal Nichols.

""That is one stubborn robot"", Dee Dee mutters.

""WHAT?!!!"" Principal Nichols angrily yells. ""YOU THINK I'M A ROBOT!!!?""

""We don't think,"" Nate responds. ""We know.""

""That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I. AM. PRINCIPAL NICHOLS!!!""

Nate tells Dee Dee, ""He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.""

""I got an idea."" Dee Dee says.

Nate and Dee Dee decide to interrogate Principal Nichols' awards, because of his ""robotic ability"" to talk to inanimate objects. These, of course, do not give any answers either, and so, Nate destroys them with a baseball bat. This greatly upsets Principal Nichols, as he paid good money for each of them, except for the coffee maker as he claims it was actually a gift.

Dee Dee brings in one final award, ""This is the last robot, Nate!""

""No!"" Principal Nichols shouts. ""Not my MVP (Most Valuable Principal) award! I got that one in my first year of working in PS38! It's the one thing keeping me going as principal! NOOO!!!""

Upon witnessing Principal Nichols break down in tears, Nate says to Dee Dee, ""I thought you said robots can't cry.""

""I also said they couldn't love,"" Dee Dee replies.

Principal Nichols continues crying. ""I loved it like it was my own.""

""Uh, at least he's not laughing.""

""Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!""

""Dee Dee, uh... how did that movie of yours end?"" Nate asks her.

""The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their imagination."" Dee Dee chuckles, realizing her mistake, then checks her watch. ""Hey, it's almost dinnertime. I gotta go. See you guys tomorrow!""

Dee Dee runs off, leaving Nate to take the heat from Principal Nichols for tying him up and pointlessly destroying his awards. As a nervous Nate grabs a broom and begins sweeping the mess, a furious Principal Nichols erupts like a volcano, screaming ""NAAAAAAAAATE!!!!"" (just like in the ""Picture Day"" short).

1iciy76,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iciy76/doctor_said_science_might_not_be_advanced_enough/,Doctor said science might not be advanced enough for a diagnosis?,"Hi everyone! I am a 25F in the USA. This might be a longer post, but I want to be as detailed as possible because I'm feeling a bit hopeless. I moved recently and just saw a new primary physician to establish care in my new area, while also getting some new opinions and fresh eyes on my medical situation. This doctor admitted that there's a chance science/ technology might not be advanced enough to figure out what's wrong with me, and maybe to consider going to Mayo Clinic. He was very thorough and went through all of my medical charts & results from previous doctors before saying this, of course. I figured I would share my entire experience so far to see if anyone could perhaps give some insight into what is wrong with me, or if my doctor might be accurate for saying this. For reference, I am average height and about 125 pounds. I've always been extremely active in sports, running, and weightlifting. I drink socially on occasion and never been into drugs. I eat healthy and typically only drink 1 cup of coffee per day.

**Some early background that I guess could be relevant but I'm unsure if it is:** Was born 2 months early, mostly minor car accident that caused pain at SI joint, aching pelvic pain whenever sitting for about 2 years (no apparent cause and sometimes still occurs), random cases of stubborn eczema, COVID twice, pneumonia shortly before symptoms began

**Timeline:  (college town most of year, summers in middle of nowhere)**

*Fall 2022:* recover from pneumonia, notice I get lightheaded/dizzy when doing squats in the gym, blame it on residual pneumonia recovery and don't think much of it. Cut them out of workout routine. Never feel better from this & still experience it today. Still can't do squats :(

*Summer 2023:* weather gets warm, 3 weeks straight of feeling constantly tired. Genuinely not a single moment in those 3 weeks that I feel awake. Noticing high heart rate, lightheaded, dizzy, weak when outside in heat, even if not being active. Job sends me to hospital (we are in the middle of no where with little resources & care). Hospital says it's hyperthyroidism & to follow up with endocrinologist. Endocrinologist does thyroid ultrasound and says one non-toxic thyroid nodule but nothing to worry about. Then says bloodwork ""doesn't make sense"" based on TSH, T4, T3. Wait out the summer until I move, symptoms continuing on & feeling like garbage

*Fall/Winter 2023:* Go back to school, weather cools down and have access to more medical care. Blood is retested & they agree bloodwork is odd. T3 normal, but TSH & T4 both low. Test thyroid and no signs of common thyroid conditions such as Graves, Hashimoto's, antibodies, etc. Doctors focus on pituitary gland based on this info. Do MRI, no mass but do note heterogeneity.

Test all pituitary hormones, all come back within normal limits including thyroid at this point. Testosterone is borderline high but still considered normal. TSH & T4 have risen to normal levels, but literally on the exact value that it transitions from low to normal. T3 has suddenly shot up fairly drastically. (don't know if important details but I'm not a doctor)

I am feeling so unwell. Exhausted all the time. Sensitive to cold and heat. On the verge of passing out just from carrying laundry up the stairs. Can no longer work out without nearly passing out & will throw up for hours after workout. Night sweat, constantly feeling like I'm in fight or flight, joint pain, acne (never had as a teenager), and much more. Exposure to heat heightens dizziness/ lightheadedness symptoms like in the shower. Feeling worse each day, but thyroid levels technically normal. This was all under the care of regular primary physician as they would not refer to endocrine until all tests & results were complete

*Spring 2024:* Finally get into endocrinologist. Endocrinologist says that I'm too sick that it can't just be an endocrine problem. Brushes me off and says it's probably autoimmune. Get frustrated and decide will find a new endocrinologist. Primary physician orders autoimmune blood tests (lupus, ANA, thyrotropin) and thyroid labs again. All come back normal. Still feel absolutely terrible. Never awake, fall asleep while working, weak, dizzy & lightheaded doing simple tasks, pounding heart.

See cardiologist based on primary's referral. Have all of the symptoms of POTS. Cardiologist measures blood pressure and says no to POTS, but do have the symptoms. Go on 24/7 heart monitor for a week. Results show tachycardia, some bradycardia, and a couple PACs with PAC burden of 1%>. Normal EKG

*Summer 2024:* Return back to same summer spot as year before. Still have symptoms and summer heat is making them (specifically the passing out kinda symptoms) worse. Acquire Apple Watch so first time having heart rate monitored that I can see. Heart rate frequently goes 160-188 without physical activity, just sitting. Okay whatever I'm used to this at this point & feel like garbage anyways. Notice not feeling well one day while walking around. Heart rate at 40 and won't go up for 2+ hours while walking around. Trying hard not to pass out and be disoriented. Go to hospital. Again, no resources at this hospital, they don't have cardiologist in hospital but HR normalizes over time being there. Tell me to just follow up with cardiologist at home. TSH test shows low levels \*Apple Watch notes low VO2 max during these months. I never noticed this feature and only have data from summer months as that was the only time I wore this watch\*

*Fall 2024:* Return back to college town, weather cools down. (Haven't made it super clear but my \*oh god I'm going to pass out I'm losing my vision\* symptoms & thyroid labs seem to be the most out of whack during the summer, and chill out slightly during colder months. Other symptoms got worse fall 2023 and have stayed equally bad).

Echocardiogram done, mostly normal but notice an atrial septal defect from positive bubble shunt test. Cardiologist doesn't think atrial defect is a major problem. Tells me I have POTS even though BP still doesn't follow typical POTS guidelines (other doctors said no to POTS). Prescribes metropropol to slow down heart rate but doesn't seem interested in figuring out why HR is so dang high. Still exhausted, full of symptoms, lightheaded, dizzy, fast heart rate, can't do anything active, etc.

Follow up with new endocrinologist. At this point suddenly haven't had menstrual cycle for 6 months. Endocrinologist pretty much ignores everything I've said, and tells me I have PCOS and to see a gynecologist. (other doctors do not agree with this diagnosis and new doctor laughed when I shared this experience with him due to how wild it was). Thyroid levels back to normal again

Tried telling cardiologist about endocrine problems and got ignored. Tried telling endocrinologist about cardio problems and got ignored.

*Now:* I feel frustrated and defeated by all of this. I feel like I can't experience the joy of my young 20s as I am so utterly exhausted all the time. I went from a super active person to someone who nearly passes out from going up the stairs, standing too fast, etc. I get frustrated and go to the gym sometimes anyways, but have to take LOTS of really long breaks to avoid passing out. I go home and throw up for hours afterwards. On a good day, I maybe have two hours of energy where I feel like myself and can be productive. The rest of the time is feeling exhausted. All of my energy goes into my job where I'm barely functioning the second half of the day. I come home and do not have the energy to do anything besides lay down. I get plenty of sleep each night and usually nap for 2+ hours after work as well. I experience tachycardia extremely often which causes anxiety. I'm shakey all the time, sensitive to heat, sensitive to cold, have low libido, and some other symptoms but you get the gist. The heart meds have made me less sensitive to becoming lightheaded and dizzy, but the tachycardia remains. My weight has not changed much through this experience besides losing 5 pounds.

I feel like I've been brushed off and ignored by so many doctors that I question myself wondering if I even am sick, am I just being overdramatic, etc. I should not be feeling like this as a relatively healthy (up to this point), very active young woman. It is not normal and my new doctor was very validating and supportive of my process so far. Again, he agreed that my situation is strange, referred me to the cardiologist & endocrinologist in the area, but noted that I might just be undiagnosable and to maybe consider going to Mayo Clinic. I'm currently sitting with a somewhat diagnoses of POTS, hypopituitarism, and hypo/hyperthyroidism depending which doctor you ask (wtf?) Cardiologist is simply sticking with POTS and giving meds to try and slow down tachycardia with no success, no other plans for the future. Will be switching providers anyways due to move. 

I would be so happy to receive some feedback, answer any clarifying questions, etc. I apologize if the formatting isn't ideal or if anything is confusing. I wanted to be as detailed but concise as possible at the same time. Hopefully I didn't forget anything. I do have access to test results and medical records if more detail is helpful.

* Body Fantasies Cupcake Swirl- this was about half empty, ive had it a while, its good but not my favorite tbh. but for its price it does last pretty well its pretty strong. Kinda a more spiced cupcake to me? no plans to rebuy tbh. I have other vanillas, and if i rebuy a vanilla it would probably be bare vanilla eventually
* VS Pink warm cookie- smells lovely, sweet spiced cookie, last like crap, kinda lingers are fabrics better, but was fine for layering. overall feel meh about it though
* BBW Bonfire Bash- this is a few years old, its great for layering for a sweet smokey vanilla. they havent released it in a couple years... vanilla romance is an *okay* substitute but not quite the same vibe imo.
* BBW Everlasting Magic- musky cherry scent that layers great with so many things, VLJ gold and Black opium is typically what i used it with most. Ill miss this one a lot. 
* Bodycology Cozy Fireside smore- smells nice... but doesnt last at all, overall very very weak, i mostly just used it on my blankets at night time
* ALT fireside Marshmallow- Nice scent actually, slightly sweeter take on Replica BTFP, but the packaging is pretty cheap. a lot of my ALTs have poorly fit lids and caps. idk... tbh i wouldnt buy from them again unless i saw it for like 15$ or less at tjmaxx or something. 
* Sugar Me Sweet waffle cone- delicious sweet battery vanilla. almost maple-y, idk if thats in the notes or not. i did love this a lot. very strong and very long lasting
* BBW vanilla romance travel- i love dis one, i have a FB on standby for next fall winter, also i have the ffm too
* BTSO nanatopia- hmm... it is nice... it does smell like a boozy banana dessert, just.. maybe too much benzoin in this one for me. was kinda fun to try tho. i think i prefer more tropical banana scents over dense gourmand banana 
* Sorce cookie party- yummy salty cookie :3 i probably would get a 15ml eventually
* Sorce 2am in lafayette-  vanilla caramel coffee heaven omg T-T sorce does coffee notes so well... i would def get a 15/30ml of this one day
* Nest Vanilla bourbon- i decanted this rollie into a 5ml travel bottle, i liked it a lot, not dying to FB it anytime... maybe a travel one day. 
* eilish dual ended rollie of of and no.2 that got decanted, i emptied the no.2 side a while ago, but emptied the original eilish side these last couple months. just wanted to use it up and get it out of my stuff lol i love both scents cause i have FB of them both already
* also tiny xerjoff itallica sample- so sweet and almondy, i would FB one day, but not anytime soon since spring will be upon us soon",9,1738116095.0,ProjectPan,0,0.91,False

In terms of criteria, I’m thinking we rate the flavor, crunch, and what else? The quest to find the best becomes so fun that we get excited when we find new brands of pickles on the market. It’s the simple things in life, right?

If you’re not an aspiring pickle connoisseur, maybe we could have an agreement where I get the pickle that you do not want? I will happily do some sort of trade for said pickle.

In all seriousness, I am hoping to find someone to get to know and eventually be able to enjoy the simple things in life with - walking the dog(s) together in the evening and talking about our days, making one of those genius but not so healthy recipes that we saved from social media, curling up on the couch with books or a good movie, picking up coffee and baked goods from our favorite local spots on a Saturday morning, packing a picnic and spending a day hiking, playing our favorite records at a volume loud enough to let some stress and tension leave our bodies, etc. 

Some qualities and characteristics I am looking for:
- Kindness, towards all humans
- Optimism, focuses on the positives and what could go right
- Easy-going, doesn’t get bent out of shape easily
- Ambition, has goals and wants to continually grow as a person
- Self-awareness, knows who they are and what they want in life
- Looking for something that could be long-term if all goes well
- Patience, because I am going to pick up the trash that someone just threw on the ground or put their cart back where it belongs
- Openness, willing to go to new places and try new activities and foods
- An animal lover, I have a rescue dog and cat, and would love to foster dogs in the future

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!

Dean helped form the CEVA perimeter around the Human group as more of them poured into the room. Despite the nearly 100 Humans slowly making their way into the one room, there was a disturbing amount of space. The D’ana’ruin ships were massive, but they only had crew sizes a fraction of Human ships. 

However, Dean was still only a maximum distance of fifteen feet from the closest snake. Despite his apprehension, he still tried to keep a calm demeanor about himself. The Humans believed themselves to be in far more danger than the D’ana’ruin, but they were also the ones with more firearms than the snakes had people on board.

Adrian approached the man’s side and stood almost shoulder-to-shoulder with him, turning to face the snakes.

“Why’s everybody calling you ‘snake fucker’ now?” he asked, opening a private comm to the man.

“Because I stopped them from killing a surrendering creature.” Adrian replied, slightly turning his helmet to see the Staff Sergeant, “Something that turned out to help us, might I add.”

“I’m not disagreeing with your actions, Sergeant.” He stated, keeping his helmet forward, “Just your attitude.”

“Listen, sir. We’re in the middle of nowhere with no contact to home, if I’m expec-” he started, getting cut off by the staff sergeant’s helmet quickly snapping towards him.

“We may be in the middle of nowhere, we may be without support, but that is no reason to disregard the chain of command as well as the respect for it.” He stated firmly, turning his helmet back to the front, “The Lieutenant was out of line, yes. That gives you zero excuse to threaten him.”

“Sir-”

“We’re all we have out here. I don’t trust these snakes, you don’t trust these snakes, and I don’t think Hayes trusts these snakes. Trust in your fellow man, and we’ll make it through this. Be a cock about it, and you’ll have to pay for those consequences when we make it back.” the Staff Sergeant said coldly, looking back at a snake, “Is that clear?”

“Sir, yes sir.” The Sergeant nodded, returning to looking forward.

“Good. I’ve already talked to the Lieutenant as well, so I consider this issue resolved. Don’t know if the Lieutenant or Commander does, but they haven’t mentioned anything to me.” he stated, nodding slightly, “On a new subject; how did salvaging the Mayweather go?”

“Well, we’ve got a decent stockpile of ammunition and medical equipment that’s being moved on board now. Weapons parts and full guns are in shorter order, though we did recover all of the Model nine-eighty-nines, as per Commander Alex’s orders.”

“How many do we have?” Dean asked, patting down his thigh pouch to feel for his own revolver.

“We recovered seven from the Mayweather and twelve from bodies. In total, we’ve got forty three.” the man stated, quickly counting off on his fingers, “And we’ve got about nine-thousand rounds for them.”

“How many are issued out?” the Staff Sergeant muttered, turning to look as the outer door of the bay, which was now bisected by some kind of hard, solid, reflective, glass-like shield, opened to space.

“Every living CEVA’s got one, even if the suit isn’t working, so that’s twenty-five right there. I know that Bailey, Mauvieux, and Bitters grabbed one each. Uhh, none of the ODSTs have one, to my knowledge, and a few of our acting ‘bridge’ members have them, excluding Hayes. He wants to keep his Glock.” Adrian muttered as he spoke, not entirely sure of the actual number of revolvers around.

“So how many would you say are out and issued right now?” Dean asked, watching as the F/A-390M slowly floated towards the bay, “Thirty-five?”

“I’d believe that number.” Adrian nodded, watching as jets of gas shot out from the Wyvern’s RCS.

“Ok, we’ll find the actual number remaining and distribute them out to whoever we deem as a rear echelon unit.” the man stated, watching as the Wyvern extended the landing gear and slowed for touchdown in the bay, “The Marines who already have the revolvers can keep them, so long as they only carry one pistol. The P-twenty-two *or* the revolver.”

“Understood, I’ll relay that out.” the Sergeant confirmed, visibly relaxing.

A new group of two lightly suited men carrying a third man on a stretcher quickly entered the room and put him down next to some medics, followed shortly afterwards by another two medics entering from the rear hall. 

“Who’s that?” Dean asked, turning around slightly to look at them.

“L-T Commander Reed.” one of the two suited Marines replied, already heading back out of the bay.

“What? He was on the bridge when it was killed, no?” another one of the medics called back, already trying to determine what was wrong with the man.

“He was in the elevator when it went off. We keep our elevators sealed. He was floating in space in that decently-sized elevator for the entire time since.” the Marine stated, “Mauvieux managed to save him way earlier, somehow. He’s pretty fucked up, and might have C-O-two poisoning.”

“Understood.” the medic called back, immediately working on the man.

“The elevators have pressure seals?” Adiran asked quietly, getting a shrug from Dean.

The Wyvern set down slowly in the isolated part of the bay, gear settling to the gravity as they shut down their Vernier engines and waited for the bay to pressurize. As soon as the glassy divider dropped, the canopy of the craft slid back, and the pilot climbed out to drag her passenger out of the jet.

Two more Marines quickly ran out of the group and towards the aircraft, helping the woman carry the other woman out of the spacecraft.

“Jesus, is this everyone?” A voice asked from behind, quickly entering the bay and stopping at the back of the group.

“Not all, but a lot, sir.” A voice piped up from inside the group.

“Ok… Here’s the plan; we’re not all going to stay in the bay.” Hayes called out, garnering the attention of most of the people in the bay, “Most of the combat personnel will be down in the cargo hold. There’s lots of room down there, so don’t get pissy about it. Of the twenty-two CEVAs we have remaining, we’re going to have seven up here guarding the medical personnel, scientists, and anybody else we leave up here. We’ll cycle you out so there’s always charged CEVAs up here. We’ll also cycle medical and technical personnel along with the CEVAs. ODSTs? Again, you’re going to stay in the cargo hold with everybody else.”

“Sir, respectfully, why the hell are we putting a few armed personnel in with the unarmed group? Shouldn’t the unarmed group be the one down by themselves?” an ODST asked, peeking over from the rear of the group.

“Faith, mainly. They’ve got a group of mostly unarmed, mostly unarmored refugees up here. We’re going to do the same. They’ll be leaving a few armed guards here, but we’re doing the same with CEVAs.” He replied, nodding slightly and resting his hands on his hips, “The D’ana’ruin have agreed to this plan, and we’re on their ship. Let’s play nice here, alright?”

Various noises of begrudging agreement came up from the crowd, but there was no distinctive disagreement from the team.

“Ok, good!” The commander smiled back, “I need seven CEVAs here to guard people, and a few more to help transfer equipment. We’ve got loading docks coming in, Rangers docking, and more consumables for us to haul. The D’ana’ruin are very enthusiastic about keeping our ‘shuttles’ around, like the Rangers, Module, and the Terrier we located in the bow cargo bay.”

“Enthusiastic, sir?” Dean asked, turning to look at the man.

“This bay is generally full of transports, mining vessels, and guard craft. It’s empty because they lost it all. They haven’t had external transportation for a long time.” He explained, motioning to the very empty bay.

“You’ve clearly been in cahoots with them, sir…” an ODST called out, standing up from his crouched position.

“And I will continue to be. This is the only way we’re going to get through this, Sergeant.” He nodded, shrugging slightly, “Now, the longer we deliberate, the more danger we’re in. Let’s get the lead out, people.” He paused to look at his watch and pressed a button, “I want to know who’s staying, who’s helping, and who’s going down to the cargo hold in five minutes.”

“Yessir.” The bay called back in sync, their coordination and sharpness gathering a large amount of concerned looks from the snakes across from the Humans.

\_\_\_\_\_

“Hey, Phonz, how’d you know what these creatures are called?” Lieutenant Nakamura asked the Marine, watching as he tried to go through the Terrier’s startup sequence.

“Sorry Ma’am, for my, and others’, safety, I can’t say.” he replied absentmindedly, hovering his hand over panels to try and find the fuel cell startup. 

“Something happen while onboard Dracula?” the ODST asked, finding the button and starting the fuel cells.

“Yes’m.” The Marine replied back sharply, typing in a code into one of the computers, letting the systems boot up while he waited.

“Based on the debriefing we saw, there wasn’t a whole ton classified there.” she muttered, a faux annoyance in her voice.

“Yes’m.” He replied again, sitting down in the command chair and continuing with the startup.

“Jesus.” The lieutenant muttered, leaning against a wall of the ship and rolling her eyes, “Loosen up, y’know? I know we’re in a bad situation, but-”

She was cut off by the lights in the craft suddenly flicking to full power, followed by a loud, sudden hissing. The Marine waited a moment and checked his arm computer readout, taking off his helmet shortly afterwards.

“Sorry, Ma’am. I was not paying attention. Repeat?” He asked, finally looking over at her.

“Well, I *was* asking how you knew what these aliens were, but apparently you can’t give that information.” She sighed, shooting a weak smile at the man while taking off her own helmet.

“Given present company, I cannot, no.” He stated, exhaling to watch his own breath condense in front of him, “Present company *not being* you.” 

“Oh good, I was worried for a moment there.” the woman snorted sarcastically, cupping her hands over her ears, “We’re in a sealed craft, who are you worried is listening?”

“You, Ma’am.” he stated, powering up the ship’s navigation and control heating systems, “Can’t have you spreading the knowledge

“Sounds like present company *is* me. Who are you worried **I’m** gonna tell?” she asked, running her hands over her ears to keep them warm, “And why’d we take off our helmets? It’s cold as shit.”

“No clue why you did, Ma’am.” Mauvieux chuckled, finally turning on the ship’s atmospheric heaters. His voice changed immediately to being far more morose and quiet when he looked back over at her, “And my main concern is that you’d tell *anybody* else.”

Her face dropped slightly as the man spoke, clearly understanding that he was very concerned about the information he carried.

“Listen. You have my word that I won’t tell anyone. This never leaves this ship.” she nodded, turning off her suit radio so she couldn’t transmit.

Mauvieux paused for a moment before turning off his suit and flipping the master communications breaker. He got out of the chair to look at her head-on before pointing at her.

“Ma’am, I’m being serious. If you say this to the wrong people, we’re all dead.” he stated coldly, sliding his life support backpack off its racks and placing it on the floor beside him, “This stays between us. Can you keep a secret?”

“I understand. I most certainly can.” She nodded, pushing off the wall so as to not appear as disinterested. Mauvieux stared at her for a moment before walking back to the seat and continuing to set up the vessel.

“Well I can too. I cannot tell you, Ma’am.” He stated, testing the RCS valves. He paused long enough to turn around and look at her, but he shook his head, “Not now. Maybe at some point, but not now. It was made very expressly clear to me that I was to keep this secret.”

The woman stared at him for a moment before grinning broadly and shaking her head.

“You know, you have a tendency to make yourself *very* interesting.” She giggled, leaning over the co-pilot’s seat.

“I have heard that before.” He muttered, shaking the ship slightly as the engines fired into standby mode.

“There’s some truth behind the statement.” She hissed back, turning to look at him and watch what he was doing, “You know how to fly this thing?”

“Absolutely not.” He stated calmly, turning on the ship’s radio again and queueing to their salvage team’s frequency, “Hey, Larson. I got this ship running.”

“Solid copy. We’re on our way. Nothing of interest here except for a few plates, mags, and some oxy-ace.” Specialist Larson called back, “You name her yet?”

“Doesn’t she have a name? Weren’t you and Atkinson Orca-One?” Nakamura asked, powering back on her suit and motioning for Mauvieux to do the same.

“Orca’s dead. We found the wreckage. I don’t know the name of that one, so I’m saying we rename her.” Larson stated, voice showing a bit of exertion as the two moved.

“Understood. I vote Lindwyrm.” the Marine stated, standing up and walking back to his life support backpack, quickly sliding it back onto the racks, “Y’know… snakes and all that.”

“I got no qualms with it.” Atkinson piped in, finally adding to the conversation.

“I was thinking ‘Lazarus’, but I think that should go to Jo’s Wyvern.” Larson stated, connection clearing as they started to get closer through the halls of the ship, “She’ll like it more than ‘Striker two’

“You’re all nerds.” Nakamura grunted, sealing on her helmet and walking to the back hatch of the cockpit.

Mauvieux shrugged as he sealed his helmet on and motioned to open the door, stepping into the cockpit/crewcabin airlock and waiting for it to cycle. The pair stepped out of the airlock, sealed it again, and sat in the cabin’s chairs, waiting for the pair of pilots to make their way back to their entrance zone and the waiting ship. 

After a few minutes of waiting, Mauvieux stood up and opened the rear ramp of the vessel. Turning on his magnetic boots and walking out, he looked out through the molten slag that previously was the roof and towards open space, looking up at the two ships a couple kilometers away. 

“Y’know… I don’t think we’re ready for this…” He muttered, turning off his magnetic boots so he could better rotate and look out of the craft.

“Say again?” Nakamura radioed out, moving to the back of the craft to look at the Marine.

“Deep space travel.” He stated, looking out through the gap, “I don’t think we’re ready for it.”

“What the fuck are you saying?” Atkinson asked, having just appeared on the landing deck himself.

“I mean, I’m looking through a hole that killed one-hundred-fifty people, likely not quickly, and am still more amazed by the alien ships and stars beyond than I am horrified at the massive loss of life.” He hissed, trying to find something to stop his slow rotation on.

“I feel like that makes us more worthy to continue doing it than some other species.” Larson stated, putting a hand on the man’s shoulder to stop his spin, “Space is still a wonder to us, it’s not commonplace yet. Once we reach the point where it’s commonplace, then we’ve got problems.”

The Marine turned to look at the man, shifting himself to orient with the floor again. He slowly lowered back to the floor, the magnetic boots slowly but surely re-connecting him with the surface. The three moved back into the Terrier, waved in by the ODST standing on the ramp. 

He sat in the back, at first, but moved up to standing over the two pilots in the cockpit as they approached the alien vessel, still appreciating the spectacle he was being given.

“Ma’am, are you sure you’ve really thought this through?” Faeoal asked, giving a wave to a passing technologist, “I mean, you do realize what’s down there.”

“Yes, I do. The equipment and supplies that will keep *both* our species alive.” Aeiruani sighed, slightly flaring her hood at the second-in-command, “They aren’t gonna destroy it.”

“Yes, but they could cut off our access to it. Control us through our supplies!” She hissed, lowering her voice as they passed by a door that led to the cargo hold.

Aeiruani paused for a moment, turning around to face the Lieutenant. She had an expression of confused concern before turning back around and continuing down their path.

“Paranoia is good. It’s what keeps us alive.” She started, slurring her words slightly, “Paranoia to the point of delirium is what will get us all killed.” 

The two snakes stopped for a moment, pausing to let two Human Marines walk past them. Both were fully armed and both were clearly terrified of the two snakes, though they tried to keep that hidden. 

When they were past and out of sight, Aeiruani motioned down the hall in the direction of the two Humans.

“If you think they believe that they’d have to control our supplies to control us, you’re not thinking. They have more rifles than we do people, and a lot of their armed people seem to be carrying two to three guns, let alone knives, bludgeons, and other tools. These are the same people who also tore through the fully armed and armored crew of a frigate.” She stated, motioning to the lieutenant, “When we were transferring people, you put on a cloaking field and searched that ship. How many D’ana’ruin bodies did you find?”

“Thirty-two…” She replied flatly, seemingly shivering as she spoke.

“Adding the one they captured and took to us, that’s the full crew.” Aeiruani continued, motioning them to continue down the hall, “These people well know that they could take this ship in less than an hour, if they wanted to. Hells, they could likely do it without losing anyone. But they haven’t. And I don’t believe they will.”

Faeoal made a low humming noise, following close behind the commander. She clearly disagreed with the woman’s view of the aliens, but she couldn’t disagree with her points. It was clear that the Humans were terrified of them, as they had yet to see any of them alone, unarmed, and unarmored. The Human Commander was the only one of the soldiers they’d seen without armor on, but even he always kept a weapon and an armed soldier nearby.

“We don’t have to like them; but we can’t hate them, and we **cannot** be afraid of them.” Aeiruani stated, heading into one of the transfer tubes and heading up towards the command deck.

“Understood, Ma’am.” The lieutenant nodded, heading in after the commander.

Hayes waited as the door slid open, stepping into the large, open area of the cargo hold when he could. He held his plate carrier in one arm and a small box of recovered instant coffee in the other. Crew darted back and forth in the bay, all taking different entrances and exits to get around the ship. No one man went off by himself; they all silently made sure that everyone had a battle buddy, and neither of them ever split.

Marines screwed CEVA loading racks into the ground while technicians attempted to figure out the power systems of the ship they were in. CEVAs hauled boxes of ammunition, weapons, and parts into the room, sorting them neatly by caliber, size, and type. ODSTs brought containers of MREs, water, oxygen, medical supplies, and anything else they had found on the Mayweather. 

When one of the Marines saw the commander walk in, he quickly stood up and saluted, calling out that there was an officer on deck. Hayes waved them down and shook his head, though he still kept their attention.

“No need to be that formal, people. We’re going to try and keep things on SOP, yes, but we’re in a far different situation than before. I don’t want to be regarded like that.” He called out, standing away from the group while he spoke to them. They let out sounds of understanding, though they were confused and slow. He turned to look around the room, trying to see if there were any D’ana’ruin listening before starting to speak again. It was more for the privacy of the Marines themselves, however; as he was wearing his radio with VOX on, so all the Humans could hear what he had to say. Once he had confirmed that they were alone, he addressed the group again.

“I’ve been walking around this ship, listening to what everyone has to say. I understand that we’re all worried about what’s going to happen to us. I understand that we’re all terrified that these creatures are going to betray us. To be fully honest, I have these thoughts myself. However, we cannot let fear dictate our actions. These people have taken us aboard because they believe that we’re no longer too different from the civilians they have in their cargo bay. 

They’re refugees of a war occurring in this sector of space. In their eyes, we’re also now refugees of a war occurring in this sector of space. They’re willing to take us back to our space, so long as we agree that they can drop off their people first, and we give them protection against boarding actions. If we do our part, stay in line, and protect the unarmed people in this ship, we’ll all make it out of this.

Again, I know we’re all scared, angry, and confused at them. I am, so I imagine that you are too. However, we do not have the luxury of fighting this many battles.

In the words of our species’ greatest space-simp, marshall, and rebel-leader: ‘You don’t have to like it, I’m not asking you to marry them. Just treat them as allies.’”

The team waited for a moment, silently staring at the commander while they milled over his words, before giving a quick and sporadic sounds of understanding and agreement. He nodded sharply and waved them off, letting them return to work.

I’m chubby. I can still do yoga and stretch and I’m pretty flexible. However, in “their” eyes, I have fibro because “I’m unwilling to work on my health and get better”.
Let’s dissect this, shall we???
“Unwilling to work on myself”?? I’m HERE aren’t I?? Do you even know what I had to do to even just drive over here??
“Get better”….. jfc. In the beginning, he seemed logical. Ha!..but when he said to “get better”, I had to correct him that that concept is unrealistic. 
I can feel better, but my health won’t eliminate fibro. D….do you not even have google, doc??
I mentioned I wanted to be able to swim again. So then he took that and RAN with it. 
He then told me, that he will refer me to a physical therapist to do workouts in the pool. 
…at this point, I’m over him, lol. I’m exhausted, I’m done, I wanna leave…
I said that’s not possible at the moment but yes I would like to swim on my own like I use to… 
He took it as, oh, this patient isn’t willing to change her habits, attitude. 
I told him, dude… have you heard of spoon theory? He said no. I told him it’s what all fibros know.(so you should fkn know) 
I saiddddd,” you can wake up, and you get up and make it to work and start your day, right? Mm??
Well, in the mornings, I wake up… period. That’s a spoon. If I hurt to at day?, I try to carefully fall out of bed, and decide if I will brush my teeth, make coffee or brush my rats nest hair.. ONE. Then I need to rest. Do you see the difference?? You’re at work and I’ve melted onto floor. Let’s just think about this rehabilitation physical therapy now. 
The main issue is that I’m in pain and have low energy. Let’s count spoons(mfkr), before we even get the the fitness center, let’s start where fibro people start. I need to get my shit together in a bag. Spoon.
I need to get dressed in my swimsuit.. SPOON! 
I live on 3rd floor, so my heiny is already doing stairs workout, which is…..!!!
A SPOON!! 
Let’s get into the car. Ok, not bad. Let’s drive 15 minutes to fitness center. Go there, find a spot close hopefully. If not, it will take me 5-8 minutes to walk inside. 
SPOON…
Fitness centers smell like ads and now I gotta wander to the bottom floor bathrooms and put my shit away!! SPOON BEECH! 
Where am I? 4 spoons 🥄.  
Quick pause- how tired are you Doc during midday?  Not bad? Maybe a spoon? Oh a teaspoon?? Mmmkay..
I’m at 4. Okay let’s continue! 
Let’s find this therapist. Tell them, I’ve swam all my life. Swim team. Pools. Rivers. Jump in pool, SPOOON.
Then I gotta bob with milk jugs ?? I don’t need to do this while expending half my SPOOOOOOOONNNNNSSS DDOOCCCCC!!!!!! 😡 
Oh but wait!!!- the session is over. Let’s see. I still gotta shower off. Get dressed. Walk back. Drive car. Walk home stairs. Get ready for bed.. PHEWWWW!! 
6 spoons baybee!!! 
Oh oops I didn’t count the morning before I go to pool appointment. 
So Doc, if I only have 10spoons., do you see how I have to very carefully select which activities I can do that day that doesn’t take away from tomorrows spoons leaving a deficit. That deficit- means I’m in so much pain. I could push through it(bc I’m a mfkn boss, who knows how to over pull her weight to over deliver.)but then I will start a fibro flare. Then I’m Spoonless for a week. A week Doc!! 
Guess.
Guess what he said. 😂 

Well…let’s see if we can get you more spoons. 

😳😵‍💫🤬 
I hate you!!! I hate you I hate men I hate doctors I hate fibro I hate invisible fkn illnesses like wtf? I hate this I hate it all!!!   Du..More Spoons??? Are you ..!? F…

Okay, I’m done. (Bow) 
Don’t please do not write back with anything mean, corrective, rude, unwarranted comments. Because I’ll let it consume me and I’ll fall into a super massive black hole 😏 and cry like a wee baby. K?

Its easily been 4-5-6 hours of that... i was sure things were dead.

the issue i think is the charger itself, 0 power from what i can tell, id imagine the hole where you put the charging cable had a lot of water in there for a long time and perhaps even got pushed further in?

I mentioned I wanted to be able to swim again. So then he took that and RAN with it. 
He then told me, that he will refer me to a physical therapist to do workouts in the pool. 
…at this point, I’m over him, lol. I’m exhausted, I’m done, I wanna leave…
I said that’s not possible at the moment but yes I would like to swim on my own like I use to… 
He took it as, oh, this patient isn’t willing to change her habits, attitude. 
I told him, dude… have you heard of spoon theory? He said no. I told him it’s what all fibros know.(so you should fkn know) 
I saiddddd,” you can wake up, and you get up and make it to work and start your day, right? Mm??
Well, in the mornings, I wake up… period. That’s a spoon. If I hurt to at day?, I try to carefully fall out of bed, and decide if I will brush my teeth, make coffee or brush my rats nest hair.. ONE. Then I need to rest. Do you see the difference?? You’re at work and I’ve melted onto floor. Let’s just think about this rehabilitation physical therapy now. 
The main issue is that I’m in pain and have low energy. Let’s count spoons(mfkr), before we even get the the fitness center, let’s start where fibro people start. I need to get my shit together in a bag. Spoon.
I need to get dressed in my swimsuit.. SPOON! 
I live on 3rd floor, so my heiny is already doing stairs workout, which is…..!!!
A SPOON!! 
Let’s get into the car. Ok, not bad. Let’s drive 15 minutes to fitness center. Go there, find a spot close hopefully. If not, it will take me 5-8 minutes to walk inside. 
SPOON…
Fitness centers smell like ads and now I gotta wander to the bottom floor bathrooms and put my shit away!! SPOON BEECH! 
Where am I? 4 spoons 🥄.  
Quick pause- how tired are you Doc during midday?  Not bad? Maybe a spoon? Oh a teaspoon?? Mmmkay..
I’m at 4. Okay let’s continue! 
Let’s find this therapist. Tell them, I’ve swam all my life. Swim team. Pools. Rivers. Jump in pool, SPOOON.
Then I gotta bob with milk jugs ?? I don’t need to do this while expending half my SPOOOOOOOONNNNNSSS DDOOCCCCC!!!!!! 😡 
Oh but wait!!!- the session is over. Let’s see. I still gotta shower off. Get dressed. Walk back. Drive car. Walk home stairs. Get ready for bed.. PHEWWWW!! 
6 spoons baybee!!! 
Oh oops I didn’t count the morning before I go to pool appointment. 
So Doc, if I only have 10spoons., do you see how I have to very carefully select which activities I can do that day that doesn’t take away from tomorrows spoons leaving a deficit. That deficit- means I’m in so much pain. I could push through it(bc I’m a mfkn boss, who knows how to over pull her weight to over deliver.)but then I will start a fibro flare. Then I’m Spoonless for a week. A week Doc!! 
Guess.
Guess what he said. 😂 

Well…let’s see if we can get you more spoons. 

😳😵‍💫🤬 
I hate you!!! I hate you I hate men I hate doctors I hate fibro I hate invisible fkn illnesses like wtf? I hate this I hate it all!!!   Du..More Spoons??? Are you ..!? F…

1icip8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1icip8i/just_tired_of_doing_everything/,Just tired of doing everything,"I'm the sole provider. We have a few sources of income, all through me.

I wake up at around 5:30 every day, feed the pets, turn on the coffee maker, empty the dishwasher, make breakfast for the kids, maybe brush my teeth, wake the kids up, help my wife start to wake up, pick out clothes for the kids, log on to my work computer for remote work, pack the kids lunches, keep them from getting too distracted to eat breakfast, get them dressed, and drop them off at school at 9:00 am. 

I then come home and work from 9 until 4, when I have to go pick the kids up from school. I then work for another 1.5 hours, at which time I make everyone their dinner. Dinner at 6:00. 

I scarf down my food in between getting up every 5 minutes to get whomever something to drink from the fridge or another plate or a napkin, all while making sure the kids are actually eating. 

At 7:00 I get the girls their desserts. At 7:30, I send the kids up for bath and/or shower. While they're doing that, I try to squeeze in a little more work, logging off at 8:00 pm. 

At 8:00 pm I go upstairs, get the girls into pj's, give them their vitamins, and then comb their hair. At about 8:45, I put the kids to sleep, usually falling asleep on the floor between their beds (they like me to be in there to help them fall asleep). I wake up at about 10:00 pm, feed the dogs, load the dishes into the dishwasher, and get my coffee maker ready for the next day. At about 11:15, I go upstairs and take my meds, brush my teeth, and go to bed at about 12:00.

My wife is usually doing what she can manage, which is tough for her as she has POTS, EDS, chronic depression, and is now recovering from nose surgery for a badly deviated septum (which had been causing her chronic sinus infections). Usually, when one of our daughters has OT or speech therapy, she's the one to drive her to therapy. 

Today... 

So last week, the older girl broke her pinky in a car door. This was about 2 days before my wife's surgery. I spent a day trying to find an in network pediatric orthopedist with availability and the closest one was an hour away with the only available appointment at 8:30 am. Because we'd have to leave at 7:00 am, that meant I'd be driving. Meaning my wife would be dropping the younger off at school. 

Took the older to her appointment, dropped her off at school, got home and saw that my wife forgot to give the younger one her lunchbox (which I had packed and put on the kitchen island). 

And in between all of that, I was still trying to be somewhat productive at work. 

At 2:00, I got the younger from school to take her to therapy and saw that she was in her pj's because my wife decided to not put the clothes that I had laid out on her. 

At 7:00 I went into the kitchen to get the older one her dessert. The younger one was upstairs in the bath. I asked my wife what the younger had for dinner, to which my wife said our child hadn't had dinner yet.

We went through a patch last year where it seemed like we were heading to divorce. I was paranoid that I wouldn't get custody and my girls would grow up without me. I've since come to realize that, honestly, I'd probably get primary custody. It's kind of moot though because it doesn't look like divorce is on the horizon any more. 

I can't really vent to anyone. Not to my wife because she already has self-esteem and self-worth problems, in no small part because of her medical problems. At the same time, I am less than thrilled to find out that our younger wouldn't have had dinner if I hadn't checked on things.

I'd have a drink but it's bad for my heart. I'd have a puff but I threw out all my stuff after I had a stent put in my heart. And if I get sick, I don't know who will take care of me. I guess I'm bitching about feeling like a single dad. 

For the record, my younger daughter had homemade buttermilk pancakes and maple syrup for dinner. She likes them, she eats them, and I know what goes into them. ",1,1738115417.0,venting,1,1.0,False

1iciev5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyShopFeedback/comments/1iciev5/why_isnt_my_etsy_shop_getting_sales/,Why isn’t my etsy shop getting sales?,"So, you’ve set up your Etsy shop, added your products, and waited... but the sales just aren’t happening. 

You’re not the only ones, and there’s usually a reason (or a few) why sales aren’t coming in. Let’s go through some common reasons:

# 1. Not Enough People Are Finding Your Shop

If buyers aren’t seeing your listings, it’s hard to make sales. SEO (titles, tags, and descriptions) plays a huge role in whether your shop shows up in Etsy search.

* Are your titles and tags specific? (e.g., “personalized gold necklace” vs. just “necklace”).
* Are you using keywords that buyers actually search for?

# 2. Your Photos Might Not Be Click-Worthy

Your photos are your first impression—they need to stand out in a sea of similar listings.

* Are they bright, clear, and professional-looking?
* Do they show the product being used or styled (like jewelry being worn or a mug on a cozy coffee table)?

# 3. Your Prices Could Be Scaring Buyers

Pricing can be tricky. Too high, and buyers might skip over it. Too low, and they might wonder if your product is low quality.

* Have you compared your pricing with similar shops?
* Do your descriptions explain why your product is worth the price?

# 4. Your Shop Needs a Little More Polish

Buyers are more likely to trust and buy from a shop that looks complete.

* Do you have a shop banner and logo that show off your brand?
* Is your “About” section filled out with your story?
* Are your policies (shipping, returns, etc.) clear and professional?

# 5. Are You Reaching People Outside Etsy?

Sometimes Etsy alone isn’t enough. Social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok can help you drive more traffic to your shop. Even a little posting here and there can make a difference.

First complaint, the golf course is a 3 hour walk away???? 3 Hours are you shitting me?????? Even with a golf cart that’s about 30 minutes. By the time I get there I’m already shitting myself from my daily energy drink because there’s also no coffee on this island. So I’m trying to golf and I keep getting harassed by the locals. No matter how many times you yell “Go away I don’t have any change” these people just will not listen. 

Which leads into my second complaint. The locals. Why are some of them fat? I don’t get it they’re all surviving on an island in primitive societies how are those fatties waddling around???

Complaint #3 the fitness center is smaller than my local planet fitness. 

Complaint #4 the food tastes like stale ass. I had to gnaw on an undercooked arm last week with no sauce it was horrible like staying in some third world country like Detroit.

Let’s get this out of the way now. Yes this is about a coworker, however I will be leaving the company soon, within 2-3 weeks. I agree never date your co workers, but in this case, we would never see each other again. 

I’ve had a crush on her for over 2 years. She is down to earth, so centered with herself, and overwhelmingly beautiful. I’ve admired from afar but ever since I accepted another job the idea of actually asking her out has grown on me. 

She’s fairly quiet, has many friends but keeps to herself usually. I do know she had a tragic relationship in the past, but now has healed from it and has been looking for something new. She’s a Latina, Roman Catholic, very traditional, loves romance, and we have many things in common (some I learned through our conversations, some just over hearing things over the years). 

Only within the last 2 months did I begin talking with her more at work. Little interactions here and there, good mornings, etc. that turned to her waving from afar and sitting with each other at break and talking a bit more. Most of our conversations have been just us getting to know each other a little more personally, nothing intimate. I heard from a mutual friend that within the last 2-3 weeks she was talking to someone but they turned her down or wanted to remain friends and nothing more. A little over 2 weeks ago was her birthday, and I gave her a flower and wished her a happy birthday before we left work. She smiled and said thank you, but I was a nervous wreck to pick up on anything else. 

Now that you’re caught up to date on our history and about her, I don’t know how I should proceed. I wish I didn’t have to do it at work because I hate interwork relationships but unfortunately the only time I see her is at work. 

I was going to catch her as we walked out of work and ask her to get coffee with me, but then I learned about the incident of her talking to someone and getting turned down and it’s got me thinking I should do maybe do more than just approach her. 

I know she loves romance and is very traditional etc etc. And if she’s been talking to other guys, and just got told that a guy doesn’t want her, it got me thinking what if I handed her a nicely decorated confession letter.  Something to stand out from the rest of the crowd and kind of appeal to her romantic side, show her that I want to be something more with her. 

But I also overthink and worry it’s too much and might creep her out, but then again I did give her a flower when wishing her happy birthday. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

Thoughts? Should I go all out or keep it casual? 

Also, since I’m leaving I don’t have any fear of rejection. Sure it might hurt me personally but I really have nothing to lose otherwise.

1iciakd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iciakd/rf_red_rose/,[RF] Red Rose,"Walter Pitman sits across from me in the funeral home's arrangement office, his hands clamped around a mug of coffee. He stares down at the table, though I’m sure he doesn’t really see the hand-polished mahogany. Thin wisps of white hair are carefully combed back. His plaid shirt is buttoned at the collar.

*He looks so lost*, is all I can think.

I open the white folder labelled with his wife’s name.

“Mr. Pitman?” I keep my voice soft, soothing.

He looks up at me, almost seems surprised to see me sitting there. I curve my lips—not a smile, but rather an expression of encouragement.

“I have a few questions to ask you, so that I can fill out the necessary government forms.”

He nods, rotates his coffee cup.

“Did your wife have a middle name?”

He looks up at the ceiling. “Ruth. Martha Ruth.”

I write Mrs. Pitman’s name on the file and ask a few more questions: What was her maiden name? What was her birth date? Where was she born?

“Did she work outside of the home?” I ask him.

Mr. Pitman surprises me by nodding. His wife was eighty-seven. Hers was a generation of proud homemakers. I wait, my pen poised above the folder.

“She looked after me.” His eyes glisten but he manages a smile. “She took very good care of me.”

“I can see that she did.” 

I put down my pen, link my hands together. This isn’t the time to write. It is the time to listen.

“It’s just the two of us. We don’t have children.” He shrugs. “Some things are not meant to be.”

I say nothing, simply nod my understanding.

“We have many nieces and nephews.” He grins. “We spoil them.”

“I’m sure you do.”

“We travelled quite a bit.” Somewhat at ease now, he sips his coffee. “Martha loved to travel. She always had to buy something, some little knick-knack, to prove that we were there.”

“What kind of things did she like to buy?”

Mr. Pitman sits back in his chair. “Oh, you know, ceramic bowls, figurines…” His voice trails off.

“Figurines?” I prompt.

He sits up again, shakes his head. “She collected those figurines from the tea boxes. You know the ones?”

I nod. “The Red Rose figurines. My mother collects them, too.”

He snorts. “I hate those damned things. Dust collectors is what they are.”

I bite back a smile. How many times had I heard my father grumble the same thing?

“She lined them up across the window ledge above the kitchen sink.” He waves his hands back and forth to demonstrate. “I got fed up one day and swept them all into a drawer. I didn’t say a word, mind you. Just went about my business. She didn’t say anything either.” He sips his coffee. “But the next morning, they were all lined up across the window ledge.”

I smile now.

“Before I went to bed that night, I put them all in the drawer.” Mr. Pitman thumps the table with his fist. “Next morning, they’re back.”

This time, I laugh. I can’t help myself. He laughs, too.

“This went on for years,” he says. “Every night I would stash them in the drawer and every bloody morning I’d wake up and they’d be lined up across the window ledge, as if they’d been there forever.”

His smile fades then and the back of my neck tingles. He cups his mug with both hands.

“When she became sick,” he looks up at me, “I mean really sick, and I could no longer take care of her, she moved into the home.” His gaze shifts, and he stares over my shoulder at some distant memory. “For the last two weeks, every night before going to bed, I've put those damned figurines into the drawer. And every bloody morning, I've taken them out and lined them up on the window ledge.”

He clears his throat. His moist, gray eyes shift to mine. “She would have wanted that,” he says.

I nod. “Yes she would.”",1,1738114205.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False
1iciabq,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1iciabq/urgent_my_first_time_in_a_competition/,Urgent!! My first time in a competition.,"Well, to start off, I can hardly call it a competition as in the official kind (as in district/city/regional/national/international) since it's just a competition between our school's branches. However, game is game. 

I just entered First Year High School (only high schoolers were chosen to fight in tourns) and defeated the previous player here during Intrams whom was the school's standard for fighting in chess tourns, which means I'll be fighting the other school branches.

My only problem is that I'm rusty. Not that much, but still. In a short period of time (and by short period of time, I mean a day), how can I improve my skills again? I was already given background on who I will face in the competition, so I know which opening lines to study. 

Additional Info: My current ELO is 900, peak 1200 on Chess.com; my most dangerous oppent's fav opening: Latvian Gambit, King's Opening, offensive type. I'm sure you understand what I'm getting at. Please help, I don't think coffee can solve this anymore  😭",0,1738114186.0,chess,2,0.33,False

I guess I expected myself to be enough for him. Basically, I raised myself and my two younger sibliings. I didn't exactly ''make it out'' like I thought I always would but...I'm ok and mostly happy and I'm still young.

But I feel like the stress of my brother is aging me beyond my years (and I was already pretty aged). He's a bum. He hops from couch to couch and spends all his money (which is very little) on booze, weed, or his girlfriend.​ He was in college, but then got kicked out for not doing his work. I told him it was no big deal, we all make mistakes. Just re apply and try again. No idea where he's at with that or if he's even trying again.

He did kinda have a job, but it was under the table so it didn't pay much and they gave him very little shifts. I'm actually not even sure if he still has the job. I don't remember the last time he went in. I told him it wasn't a very smart place to work and he should look for a real job- one where he wouldn't have to pay someone to drive him in and he could catch the city bus or walk or something. Doesn't seem like he's doing that.

He could have had a job right out of highschool at a coffee shop he was working at for a credit- but he messed that up too.

As I mentioned before, he hops from couch to couch. He'll spend some nights at his girlfriends. Some nights at his friends (where they drink non stop and do shrooms). Some nights at moms and then some nights at dads. He has all of his stuff in a corner behind the couch at my moms place. It makes me sad.

Finally- his girlfriend. She's called the cops on him for sexual assult, he got arrested and charged. I don't know the full ins and outs because I guess maybe he was embarressed, but she dropped the charges and they're ''fine'' now. I was very upset when the cops came knocking on the door, looking for him and they told me the situation. I guess he missed a court date and they said if they had to come looking again, they would arrest him- again. But I was LIVID when I spoke to him and he said she was lying but it's ''ok because she's gonna drop the charges''. He mainly lives with my mom who has younger childeren- if he had to register as a sex offender, he probably wouldn't even legally be allowed to stay at my moms anymore. Then what would he do. I'm not sure how it all works but I'm sure it would have messed with his schooling and job oppurtunities.

He spends his last dimes on her which is embarrasing to say the least. It's gotten to the point where we can't even have conversations because it always leads to me scrunching up my face and saying something. He was like, ""'ok I'm gonna ask dad for $50 and get her flowers and -'' and I couldn't even listen. If my 18 year old boyfriend had to ask his dad for money to get me flowers- I wouldn't even want the flowers. Like go get a job and go worry about yourself first.

I'm at a loss. It feels like he's spending more and more time at his girlfriends, probably because everytime he's around family, we're asking ''wtf are you doing with your life??'' We've had countless conversations with him and he doesn't care!! And it's like evryday, I get more frustrated and angry with him, he just grows more resentful. It feels like he hates me. He doesn't say goodbye to me when he leaves. He doesn't care when he breaks or loses my things. ( I gave him one of my phones when he lost his, he lost it the next day when he got black out drunk and never even said sorry. I still had all my pictures and notes and eveything on there). The other night, he took all of my lighters, I had about 5 of them. I wasn't about to walk to the gas station to buy another one, it was FREEZING that night, plus I shouldn't fucking have to. When I brought it up to him the next day, he laughed. He does that a lot. If you bring up something that hurt you, he gets super defensive about it or laughs, or just doesn't care. For example, my brother said he was gonna make dinner at my dads the other night. Me and my dad had to run some errands, and we said we'd like to eat when we get back. Decided he probably wasn't gonna cook, so we picked up some food. Just like we thought, he didn't even get up from the couch. When we questioned him on why he didn't cook, he said, ''who cares, you got food''.

Sorry, this turned into more of a rant. I guess I just needed to get this out. It's like I don't know him anymore.

Edit: Ughhh this is seeping out into other ares. I've been crying for the last hour so I haven't been able to look at my sister or give her real answers so she just slammed the door, probably thinking I have an attitiude or something. But in all fairness, leave me alone about the damn chicken, I can cook for myself lmaooo",2,1738113853.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We go out, and everything goes swimmingly. We chat after the hangout, and we call it a night. The next day, we're still having fun talking, so i ask her out on a real date. She tells me ""maybe"", since she's busy with school. No biggie. I wait a few days.

When i talk to her again she is *completely* stonewalling me. Not speaking to me whatsoever. When i try to spark a conversation she gives me looks of disgust- feels almost like shes annoyed that would even dare speak to her. It makes me feel **absolutely** dreadful.

Ive struck out before of course, but this time feels the worst because i cannot understand what i did to deserve this treatment.

I wake up at around 5:30 every day, feed the pets, turn on the coffee maker, empty the dishwasher, make breakfast for the kids, maybe brush my teeth, wake the kids up, help my wife start to wake up, pick out clothes for the kids, log on to my work computer for remote work, pack the kids lunches, keep them from getting too distracted to eat breakfast, get them dressed, and drop them off at school at 9:00 am. 

I then come home and work from 9 until 4, when I have to go pick the kids up from school. I then work for another 1.5 hours, at which time I make everyone their dinner. Dinner at 6:00. 

I scarf down my food in between getting up every 5 minutes to get whomever something to drink from the fridge or another plate or a napkin, all while making sure the kids are actually eating. 

At 7:00 I get the girls their desserts. At 7:30, I send the kids up for bath and/or shower. While they're doing that, I try to squeeze in a little more work, logging off at 8:00 pm. 

At 8:00 pm I go upstairs, get the girls into pj's, give them their vitamins, and then comb their hair. At about 8:45, I put the kids to sleep, usually falling asleep on the floor between their beds (they like me to be in there to help them fall asleep). I wake up at about 10:00 pm, feed the dogs, load the dishes into the dishwasher, and get my coffee maker ready for the next day. At about 11:15, I go upstairs and take my meds, brush my teeth, and go to bed at about 12:00.

My wife is usually doing what she can manage, which is tough for her as she has POTS, EDS, chronic depression, and is now recovering from nose surgery for a badly deviated septum (which had been causing her chronic sinus infections). Usually, when one of our daughters has OT or speech therapy, she's the one to drive her to therapy. 

Today... 

So last week, the older girl broke her pinky in a car door. This was about 2 days before my wife's surgery. I spent a day trying to find an in network pediatric orthopedist with availability and the closest one was an hour away with the only available appointment at 8:30 am. Because we'd have to leave at 7:00 am, that meant I'd be driving. Meaning my wife would be dropping the younger off at school. 

Took the older to her appointment, dropped her off at school, got home and saw that my wife forgot to give the younger one her lunchbox (which I had packed and put on the kitchen island). 

And in between all of that, I was still trying to be somewhat productive at work. 

At 2:00, I got the younger from school to take her to therapy and saw that she was in her pj's because my wife decided to not put the clothes that I had laid out on her. 

At 7:00 I went into the kitchen to get the older one her dessert. The younger one was upstairs in the bath. I asked my wife what the younger had for dinner, to which my wife said our child hadn't had dinner yet.

We went through a patch last year where it seemed like we were heading to divorce. I was paranoid that I wouldn't get custody and my girls would grow up without me. I've since come to realize that, honestly, I'd probably get primary custody. It's kind of moot though because it doesn't look like divorce is on the horizon any more. 

I can't really vent to anyone. Not to my wife because she already has self-esteem and self-worth problems, in no small part because of her medical problems. At the same time, I am less than thrilled to find out that our younger wouldn't have had dinner if I hadn't checked on things.

I'd have a drink but it's bad for my heart. I'd have a puff but I threw out all my stuff after I had a stent put in my heart. And if I get sick, I don't know who will take care of me. I guess I'm bitching about feeling like a single dad. 

For the record, my younger daughter had homemade buttermilk pancakes and maple syrup for dinner. She likes them, she eats them, and I know what goes into them. ",1,1738113776.0,complainaboutanything,0,1.0,False

30 year old male /father here.

I've struggled with emetophobia since I was 5. 
I'm still working with a psychologist. 
I fear my little girl waking us up projectile vomitting (hasnt happened yet)
I fear food poisoning, wash my hands alot worrying about the Norovirus. Ill say a prayer at night that I don't catch a bug. 

Anyways, I read my triggers I just listed and I feel like I'm 70% not as triggered by them at this very moment. Absolutely nothing changed in my life except that I made a resolution to cut all coffee out of my life for 2025. I've been drinking decaf only. I do have a history of anxiety and take concerta for my ADHD but let me tell you something. I have discovered that coffee in itself causes 80% of my anxiety and would just fuel my emetophobia through the roof. 

I can confidentially say that yes, I still deal with emetophobia, but the fkn super weird thing is, I don't let it consume my day to day life as it has while I drank coffee for the past 15 years. I am still getting therapy, and I am excited to honestly someday relief myself from it completely, but man oh man, I seriously can't say how much just drinking a cup of coffee per day for me made it worse. 

I figured I'd write this because my wife noticed the biggest change in me.

Normally, I'm suuuper antsy around meat, cooking chicken, ect and this week she was concerned about some storebough chicken, and was nervous and here I am not giving a shit about how it looked and said, yeah that's perfectly fine chicken, so what?

Her mouth dropped.
She couldn't believe it.

Coming from someone who be so anxious about anything pertaining to the potential of vomitting.

1ici4ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ici4ml/my_insecurities_are_eating_me_up/,My insecurities are eating me up.,"Insecure ako. Sa achievements ko, sa professional life ko, sa ex girlfriend ng boyfriend ko. 

This all started when I was working for a small company as an HR officer. I was a fresh graduate, when I was offered the job. I accepted the offer because I wanted to be like the HR Manager who interviewed me. I wanted to learn from her, be like her. 

On my first day, I found out I was the talk of the small office because the interviewers talked about how I was a junior copy of our HR Manager. Everybody was excited to see me. I always get ""Hala oo nga, parang si Ms. *******"" from random employees during my first week. It was a compliment because I really wanted to be like her. 

Two weeks in, I found out that I was not supposed to get the job. The CEO of the company didn't think it was necessary to have an HR Officer. My manager, a seasoned HR, thought otherwise. She fought for me to get in because she wanted to work with me and establish a reliable and efficient HR office for the company. I was excited to be a part of something significant, so I did my best. 

A month in, my manager resigned immediately. Had a conflict with the executives (CEO, COO, and VP). I was privy to the information that the CEO never really liked her as the HR Manager because she ""didn't fit culturally"". With my manager gone, I felt like a headless chicken running the HR office without guidance, figuring things out on my own.

But the employees loved me. I processed their payroll efficiently with little to no errors, I met deadlines. I've drafted reports I'm not familiar with. I initiated doing pulse checks and studied patterns of employee behavior in the office. I get to attend executive meetings as a rank and file employee representing the whole HR office and presented studies, findings, and suggestions. Apparently, it wasn't enough for the CEO. It almost felt like she didn't want anything to do with me because I was just another Ms. *********. I (according to them) was not culturally fit. 

This is where it all started. I get to be blamed for things I never knew were my responsibility even the smallest of things that are not part of my JD (e.g. lack of office supplies, empty coffee beans, broken toilet seat cover, etc). I didn't have a superior who would instruct or even guide me. I felt like a child lost in a grocery store. I know I wouldn't thrive in that kind of environment, so I quit.

Enter boyfriend's ex girlfriend, Patricia. A recent graduate. She worked under the CEO directly. She was trained, there were goals for her to meet. KPIs were set. She basically had a clear picture of what were her duties and how she would do them. The CEO gave her a hard time but it was all for her. The CEO saw her potential so she was pushed to be the best. I can tell, CEO sees herself in Pat that's why she had high expectations. 

I wish they saw potential in me too. I wish I was pushed like that. I'd prefer scrutiny over being ignored as if my contributions meant nothing. It's pathetic but I sought for validation. I didn't like our CEO, but I couldn't deny that she was great. I wanted to be like her too. I wanted to learn from her. I wanted her to see I've got it in me. But she didn't. She saw it in Patricia. To the CEO, I was just another quiet quitter.

Maybe it would hurt less (or not at all) if Patricia was just another stranger to me. But she isn't. 

I wanted to build a career, but my insecurities are eating me up. What if I'm not really good as I thought I was? What if I'm the only one seeing my potential? I am now a red flag for potential employers because I only had 5 months experience to my resume. Didn't even reach the end of probationary stage. 

I am now in a new job. It's contractual, no job security. And I'm so insecure about it. ",1,1738113722.0,OffMyChestPH,4,1.0,False

1ici2qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruises/comments/1ici2qy/liberty_of_the_seas_first_timer/,Liberty of the seas (first timer),"Just wanted to talk about my experience with my 3 day cruise I just went on with my wife. Jan 24-27th 2025. This was my first cruise and I wasn’t sure what to expect. I will start with a pros and cons list

Pros: 
-The staff: the staff was extremely nice and helpful. They seemed to genuinely care about serving its customers. The whole dynamic of working on a cruise ship is interesting to me and it seems like the majority of the workers enjoy their jobs. I noticed most were from places like Indonesia and Philippians (says so on name badges) 

-The room: the size of our spacious interior room was bigger than expected. The shower was roomy and had great water temperature. The lighting in the main room was great for my wife while she put on makeup. 

-The bars: the bartenders were extremely fast with getting drinks and I even had one bartender that had beers ready to go and in front of me before I could even ask. My wife loved the Miami vice drinks. (We had the deluxe drink package) 

Coco cay: what a cool island. There are no locals trying to sell you things at this stop unlike Nassau. The beach is great and the chairs provided with umbrella are comfortable. The all you can eat lunch they provide is excellent and that includes a taco bar among many other things. I would rate this hurt much better than the one offered daily onboard. 

Checking out process: we checked out around 7:30 and opted to carry our own bags out. The entire process including walking off the ship and showing identification to get out of building maybe took 30 minutes. 

The casino: the casino was one of our favorite parts and we spent most of the time on the quarter machine. I will say they need more change machines for when you run out of quarters 

The cons

-The daily buffet. I know it’s included with your stay but the quality of food was lacking. It almost had a school lunch feel to it. They offered American cuisine such as hot dogs and hamburgers, salads, chicken fingers. They also had some international food that I was not familiar with. The best dish I had at the buffet was the lamb stew. The breakfast was not the greatest. I believe the eggs were powdered and the bacon was thin and overcooked. 

The elevators: I think I’m still waiting for the elevator to move off of floor 5. Seriously there were times where certain elevators wouldn’t move floors and sometimes when you needed to go up all the elevators were going down/vise versa. We opted for the stairs sometimes even though we were on deck 10. 
 
The Room: I have the room on pros and cons. There is no air flow in the interior room and the AC unit is mounted on the ceiling and barely pushes out any air. We had the thermostat turned all the way down and still woke up sweating. The Tv was small and most of the channels had no reception and broken sound at times. 

Nassau: as soon as you get off the boat in Nassau you are bombarded by locals asking if you need a taxi, side by side, jet ski, boat ride, ect. We also got approached by someone trying to sell us a cruise with just port fees (no catch…..). The straw market is just as bad. Some lady wanted $30 for a coffee mug that was also sold in stores for $15. Every stand you go to they try hard to sell you something even when you just tell them you’re  just looking. Now I understand this is how the island makes their money but it’s almost too much from every direction. 

The Arcade: the arcade needs to be updated. The guitar hero game buttons do not work correctly (a wasted $2). The ski ball machine had issues. Most games are $2. 

Kids: it seems there is no enforcement for children in adult only areas. I say several children in the casino without a parent running around. Also kids in the adult swimming/woorl pool area 

Overall I was definitely get on this ship again. I recommend the drink package. I had 18 drinks the first day alone. Drinks average $10 and up. I recommend bringing a portable fan for the interior room. 

My review might have been drastically different if I could compare it to something else but it was my first cruise. I’ve heard Royal is better than carnival so I will stick with Royal and probably get a Royal credit card for cruise points.

1ichx3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/1ichx3h/did_ramseys_ever_report_having_immediately/,Did Ramseys ever report having immediately checked on Burke? (RDI),"Such as: “And then we immediately ran into Burke’s room to see if he was gone, too.” Was there ever any semblance of this? What I’ve read/heard is that yes, one or both of them DID go into Burke’s room, but only in the context of looking for JonBenet, as she would sometimes sleep in his room. 

If Patsy had only skimmed RN quickly and sporadically, and only the first of three pages, the first being addressed to “Mr. Ramsey”- how could she know that the next page wouldn’t be for “Mrs. Ramsey”? How could she know that the RN didn’t include directives for her in regards to a missing Burke? Having only read a few lines of the RN, she couldn’t have known that JonBenet was the only one missing, she couldn’t have known that the next two pages weren’t written to “Mrs. Ramsey”- she couldn’t have known if Burke, too, had been kidnapped.  

For all she knew, the remainder of the letter could’ve said “Mrs. Ramsey, you’ll find that we also have Burke” or “A bomb has been attached to Burke” or “You’ll find that we’ve already beheaded Burke”- or even- “you’ll find that Burke is safely sleeping in his bed” - you get the idea. 

I guess I have one comment and then one question. 

My comment being - if there are three pages, and the first page you see is clearly labeled: “Mr. Ramsey”- I think you’d at least see if the next page or two was for you, “Mrs. Ramsey.” 

But more importantly to me is my Question: 

Did they ever report going into Burke’s room for the primary purpose of checking on him? As opposed to going into Burke’s room under the guise of checking for JonBenet? 

I can make sense of not reading the entire letter before sprinting upstairs to check on JonBenet, but you’d also instinctively worry about and check on Burke, as well, bc that’s what a parent would naturally do, but bc also, in the back of your mind, you’d know that you didn’t have all of the RN info- you’d brace yourself to find an empty bed in Burke’s room aswell. Then upon finding him, you’d pull those covers back to make sure all of him was unscathed. Maybe they DID report doing that and I just missed it. I’ve only seen/heard/read about them entering Burke’s room for the sole purpose of locating Jonbenet, not to check on Burke. 

Re the Ramsey version where Patsy purportedly checks on JonBenet BEFORE descending stairs/making coffee/finding ransom note, have they ever reported also checking on Burke at that time? Because if we’re going with that version- PR finding JonBenet’s empty bed prior to finding letter, she would most certainly check on Burke at that time, too, Right? As she wouldn’t have yet known that a note involving only jonbenet- awaited her.

1ichw88,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ichw88/the_journal/,The journal,"A few weeks ago, my farther died suddenly of a heart attack. I was devastated when I got the news, even though we hadn't spoken in months as soon as I got the call it made me value him so much more. My heart filled with regret that I hadn't spent as much time with him as I could have and that I would never be able to see him again. I would never be able to hug his burly broad-shouldered frame ever again. It hurt; it was the pain which cuts through you and forms a heavy metal ball in your chest which at the time feels as if it will never be lifted. 

After the funeral I made the long drive from the city to a small town on the edge of the state. Here there was a small cabin that my farther had owned. I spend the drive thinking about him, he had only been 64.  

Even though I had grown up in this town I couldn't remember it, the cabin I vaguely remembered, I remember it was on the edge of a river which divided the forest in two. I couldn't remember his voice; he spoke so little, and it had been so long since we spoke. The regret was almost too much. 

When I arrived at the cabin there was a blue truck parked in the driveway with a man in denim jeans standing next to it. When I got out, he walked over to me and introduced himself as Rick. 

“Oh, yeah” I said awkwardly. I remembered him from the barbeques that we used to host when I was younger. He looked older now with thin grey lined running through his hair and crow's feet forming at the edge of his eyes. 

“I’m really sorry about your dad...” He trailed off. There was an awkward silence. It was apparent that neither of us were good about emotions, so I switched the subject. 

“The house?” I said 

“Yeah. Urrr the key is in that lock box over there; I came to say that the codes 2321.” 

“2321. Got it thanks” I said willing this interaction to be over. 

“Alright, ill be on my way, oh one more thing. You do remember to stay on this side of the river” Rick had a serious look on his face now. This last remark bought back a memory I had when I was much younger. I remember playing in lightly wooded area behind the cabin. I remember seeing a wooden bridge which traversed the river and went up to it. I remember still being able to see the cabin from the bridge, so I began to cross it. It was at this point that my Farther grabbed me from behind and told me never to cross the bridge without him. I remember crying but not much after that. He was always calm so when he got angry it was the scariest thing that younger me could fathom. 

“Don't worry, I remember” I said. The look on my face clearly convinced Rick so he nodded his head and left. 

When I entered the cabin, it was much smaller than I had originally remembered it. It was only one floor and was decorated exactly how you would imagine a single farther would decorate such a cabin. There was a big TV and couch occupying the living room with an old hunting rifle mounded on a wall below a deer head. The kitchen was small but well stocked and from the window I could see the small wooden bridge that crossed the river. 

My old bedroom was just as empty as I’d left it. No windows, no soul. 

 His room, which I had never entered before, was bigger than expected. He had a double bed and a large oak wood wardrobe full of hunting jackets and baseball caps. All was as to be expected except for a writing desk in the corner. On this desk there was a ragged looking leather-bound journal. 

It immediately caught my eye, so I picked it up and took it to the living room. This is what it contained, verbatim. 

Hunting Journal 

“As a hunter in the Asher woodlands district I write this journal to document my observations”  

So that's what my dad did for a living. I remember him always bringing back dead animals, but we never ate any of them, I never understood why. I guess he sold them to buy food from the general store instead.  

“In this district there are two types of deer that you will encounter, the black tailed deer which is common across the United States and the Asher deer which is exclusive to our region. It can be identified, primarily through its orange, blonde fur. There deer are an endangered species so if you encounter one only observe.” 

“Another inhabitant of the Asher district is the Darcrymycetarachnid, many of the locals however refer to them as clingers. This is a fungus which grows on dead trees exclusively, it is given its name because if it out grows the tree it develops on it will sprout 8 legs and will begin to crawl away in a spider like manor to find another piece of dead wood to feast on. The fungi are white and furry and are an invasive species so if you encounter one either of a dead tree or moving across the forest flaw burn, drown or eviscerate them to protect the local wildlife that may try to feed of them. They are slow moving and are no denser than any other form of moss and are, at the moment exclusive to the Asher woodland district.” 

This paragraph caught we well of guard. No way that's real. Spider fungi that crawls along the forests floor? My farther had never had a sense of humour and why would he make this up. I continued reading. 

“One of the most common creatures in the district is the two tailed Asher fox. As the name implies, it is a typical orange fox but with two tails. Despite the name however they can be found outside of the Asher district, but they are most often seen within the district. They are friendly and will only attack if threatened, the two tails give then greater agility as well as the ability to cover their tracks as they move. One time my kid saw one of these foxes near our house and asked if we could keep him. As they were friendly enough, I said sure why not. After throwing him some bread he would come by every morning and afternoon for food. We call him Fillbert.” 

This bought back a flood of memories, I remember Fillbert, I swear that one time while holding a piece of toast I got him to sit but he had stood up by the time dad had come over. Now I look back on it I never did wonder why he had two tails, I guess because I was so young and my farther never seemed surprised by it, so I wasn't either. Thats just how it is as a kid. I wonder what happened to Fillbert. 

“It is important to always be prepared when entering the heavily wooded areas of the Asher district. While a compass, a gun and basic survival supplies are expected, you should also have at least one core memory to cling onto while exploring the depths of the woods. This is because not all threats are physical in the Asher districts deepest areas, there is a myth among the towns old folk that the forest has the power to make a man lose his mind which can only be fought off by a core happy memory that you possess. This is probably bullshit spouted by those old coffin dodgers to get some attention.” That last part was written in pencil below the entry. 

Another creature exclusive to the Asher woodland district is the Lily vine squid. They only found in the two small lakes within the district. They look like lily pads from the surface with the flat green head being the only part that protrudes from the water. However, if you were to pull one of these from the water you would see the squid like body that lies underneath. They can measure up to 15 feet long and their tentacles are covered with sharp barbs which they use to catch fish and other creature's unfortunate enough to go too far into the water, they are stationary all day unless disturbed and are few in number. While its unknown how many there are as their heads are indistinguishable from the regular lily pads which grow next to them, there's probably about half a dozen in total. They aren't a threat to anything on the shore and the general rule is that you'll be ok if you don't wade in to above your knees. My uncle had a dog named Skipper which he lost to a Lily vine squid once, he was inconsolable for days, he threatened to take a can of gasoline and “burn them all to hell” We persuaded him not to.” 

I remembered Skipper, he was this hyper energetic black Border collie that got the zoomies a lot. Rest in peace Skipper. 

 I loved how dryly my dad wrote about all of this; I don't think he realised the humour of that final line. 

“As well as wildlife there also diseases that are exclusive to the Asher district, however there is only one that can infect humans, there is no name for this disease, so everyone calls it different things, the most common of which is man flu. This comes from a joke that the women of the town tell that all men are born with this disease. The disease doesn't affect a person physically but mentally, it removes one's ability to feel fear, greatly increases one's tolerance to pain and dulls certain motions. However, despite this the infected individual can live a very normal life, one of my closest friends Rick Whitmore has had this disease for decades. We found out when one day a clinger fell from a tree on top of him. You would expect a 17-year-old boy to panic at this, but he didn't even flinch. It was this moment that we realised he may be infected. 

 People with this disease are dangerous, not because they would harm you themselves but because they don't possess the fear of losing you, that is not to say that they see you as worthless but to say that they cannot fathom the emotion of losing you until you are gone. Ricks farther had many heath issues before he died but it never affected Rick while his dad was in the hospital as he didn't possess the capacity to fear the loss. However, I can attest that when Mr Whitmore passed on, he was devastated.” 

I can relate to Rick. I wish I had known this when I had met him earlier, he can relate to me more than anyone else in the world right now.  

I put the book down, this journal seemed impossible, and it was making me too emotional. How did he do it, my dad always seemed so in control of what he was feeling, I wish I was like him. I wish that things between us had ended better. Theres so much I wish I could say. 

I made myself something to eat, I was tired, the drive up here had been so long and with all the emotion of the day I needed a break from it all. I slept on the couch that night. I fell asleep instantly, when I awoke the room was dark, it must be late, I reached for my phone wearily, the time was 4:44. I rolled over onto my back and stared up at the ceiling. Just as I closed my eyes to try and rekindle sleep there came a faint tapping on the window. It was so quite at first, I thought I may not have even heard it but then it came again slightly louder. I lifted my head slowly, my eyes looked at the living room window but nothing. Then a bang from the front door. I shot up and backed into a wall. From here I could see most of the cabin. Nothing. Then from both the door and the roof above me three more loud knocks. My heart was racing, my eyes watered, the rifle mounted on the wall was across the room. I should run for it. Just as my feet began to shift the cabin shook as if all the walls were being pounded against at once. The windows rattled and I dropped to the ground. The banging persisted for a few more moments until, all at once, it stopped.  

I sat with my back to the wall until the sun came up. My hands were trembling, only when sun light had engulfed the room did, I stand up. I went for the gun immediately and checked if it was loaded, it was. I looked around the cabin, nothing was out of place. I peered out the window but saw nothing. I finally built up the courage to step outside and see what had happened. There was no damage to the exterior of the cabin, the wood was still its dark brown color with no scratches or indentations. The same could not be said however for my car. The windscreen had been smashed in and the rubber on my front left tire had been torn to shreds. As well as this there were two long claw marks down the side of the passenger side door. I went back inside and locked the door. My immediate thought was to phone Rick or someone to get me out of here. No signal. My eyes caught a landline phone hanging on a wall in the kitchen. I ran over to it and rang the police.  

“Asher county sherifs office, what's your emergency?” A woman with a soft voice asked. 

“Urrr, hello I think someone's vandalised my car and I can't get back to town. I'm in my dad's cabin aways from town.” I didn't think that a vandal had done that to my car, but I didn't know what else to say. 

“Ah, ok, are you in the property by the river?” She asked 

“Uhh yes” I replied hopefully. 

“Ok, well there was a bad storm last night and many of the roads are blocked off. We’ll send someone out as soon as we can but until then stay where you are.” 

“Wait, you don't understand” I pleaded 

“I'm sorry sir but there are trees in the road, we are trying to clear the as fast as possible. We’ll have someone there by the evening”  

“Ok” I gave in, it was 7:56 now. I only had to last the rest of the day. I’d get the officer to give me a ride into town and an I’d stay in a hotel while my car gets fixed. I'm not spending another night here. I considered walking to town; all I had to do was follow the road. But whatever did that to my car is out there. I'm not leaving the cabin until police arrive. 

I sat in the living room imagining whatever eldritch creature I had encountered last night. I reopened the journal. 

“Asher county is home to another endangered species known as lumber cats. They are long and ferret like in shape. Their fur is a dark brown with lighter brown specs. They use this to camouflage onto trees. The face is feline and the move incredibly quickly. They tend to feed on birds and other small creatures such as squirrels, but they're harmless to humans. Again, if you encounter one, observe only. 

One of the more dangerous creatures in the area are known as howlers. They are tall skinny and walk on all fours. They’re hairless with grey skin however they are feeble and weak by nature. They are renown as dangerous because their bite, while weak, is incredibly painful as their teeth are known to come loose and to imbed themselves in the flesh of the victim. Removing these teeth can take a doctor hours due to their fine and plentiful nature. Howlers get their name because similarly to parrots they can mimic human voices. Fortunately, however it is only older howlers that can form coherent sentences as the younger ones haven't overheard enough human conversation to speak properly. Therefore, all voices that cannot be directly attached to a human body should be treated with great mistrust. 

At night the Asher County woodlands is said to be plagued by many demons and dark spirits. This rumour originates from the towns elders who often tell tall tales about spirits that feed of negative emotions.” 

This section caught my eye, could I have led some entity here. I continued reading 

“They are said to originate from a source deep within the woods that leads to hell. I have never encountered any of these in my time as a hunter in Asher County however the village elders claim that to dispel one of these spirits one must let go of what hold them back” 

How do you let go, there's so much I should have said to him before he died, I was such an idiot for leaving for the city. I should have stayed and been with him. My eyes teared up thinking about this. I sat for a moment reflecting, when this didn't work. I went to the kitchen. I looked out the window and saw the wooden bridge that traversed the river. Would burning it help, I thought to myself.  

The hours went by and still no sign of the police officer, I considered calling again but I didn't want to piss off the people coming to help me. The lady said to stay put, I've got the rifle, I’ve got food, I'll be ok. The sun began to sink below the horizon, and nerves began to set in. I had moved the sofa into a corner and was ready for what the night was going to bring and sure enough. There came a tapping at the window. I readied my rifle ready to kill anything that entered the building. When the pounding began it was deafening, the walls were shaking, saw dust was falling from the ceiling, windowpanes were rattling and yet in the midst of all this noise a thought occurred to me.  

He’s gone, and there's nothing I can do. But that's ok. It may not have ended how I wanted it too but that's how life is sometimes, I can't let what happened in the past consume me. I need to make the most of the time I have left and live the life he’d have wanted me to live.  

I hadn't even noticed that the banging had stopped. I looked around the cabin. It felt bigger now, how I had remembered it. I smiled. It felt weird I hadn't smiled in a long time. I went to the kitchen and made a cup of coffee; I drank while I waited by the front door. Within an hour, I saw red and blue flashing lights coming up the driveway. I put the gun back where I had found it and stepped outside.  

After a brief conversation with the police, he drove me back to town. On the drive back he was talking about some unexpected storm that blew through that stopped just as he left the station. I wasn't listening, the world felt a warmer place. 

That was a few weeks ago, I'm back in the city now where I'm writing this account of what I experienced. The book is next to me on the table, I've kept it to remind me of him. My advice to anyone reading would be to call a loved one, you won't regret it. ",2,1738113039.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The Symbolism of Bears in Kitchen Design and Decor Choices
----------------------------------------------------------

Bears have long held a place in human culture as powerful symbols of strength, courage, and nurturing. When it comes to home decor, particularly in the kitchen, incorporating bear themes can infuse warmth and character into the space. Many people choose bear motifs as a way to reflect their love for nature or to evoke cozy cabin vibes. This unique design choice not only adds charm but also carries a meaningful message. Here’s a closer look at how bears can symbolize various values in kitchen decor.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/bear-home-decor-kitchen  
  
First, bear symbolism brings a sense of strength and stability. The bear represents resilience, a trait that’s especially important in the kitchen, a space where you create nourishing meals for your loved ones. By integrating bear shapes or designs, you can create an environment that feels solid and supportive. This symbolism manifests itself through various decor elements such as:

- **Bear-themed tableware:** Dishes, mugs, or utensils featuring bear motifs can make your dining experience feel more charming.
- **Bear artwork:** Wall art depicting bears can serve as a focal point, inspiring conversations and a warm atmosphere.
- **Textiles:** bear-printed tablecloths, dish towels, or placemats adds layers of comfort and character.

Beyond strength, bears symbolize nurturing qualities. In nature, mother bears are known for their protective nature over their cubs. This powerful imagery resonates well in the kitchen—a space traditionally associated with caregiving. When you bring in bear decor, you may find that it enhances the feeling of being in a home that values family and togetherness. Consider these elements to reflect nurturing symbolism:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/bear-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Bear-themed cookbooks or recipe boxes:** Displaying these can encourage family cooking, making it a shared activity.
- **Bear-shaped kitchen gadgets:** Items like cookie cutters, measuring cups, or even magnets can add a playful touch.
- ConclusionEmbracing bear home decor in your kitchen can transform this vital space into a warm and inviting area that reflects your personality and love for nature. By incorporating creative ideas such as bear-themed dishware, wall art, and textiles, you can bring a touch of wilderness indoors. Whether it's playful bear prints on curtains or rustic wooden accents that feature bear motifs, these choices add charm while enhancing the overall ambiance.
    
    Moreover, the symbolism of bears plays a significant role in kitchen design. Bears often represent strength, courage, and nurturing, which aligns beautifully with the kitchen's essence as a gathering place for family and friends. Choosing decor that embodies these qualities not only enriches the aesthetic but also fosters a sense of comfort and safety.
    
    As you decorate your kitchen with bear-inspired elements, consider how each piece resonates with these values. A bear-themed centerpiece or a cozy blanket draped over a chair can instill warmth and encourage heartfelt conversations during family meals.
    
    Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/bear-home-decor-kitchen  
      
    Ultimately, integrating bear home decor into your kitchen is about more than just aesthetics; it’s a way to create an environment where memories are made and relationships are nurtured. Allow your decor to tell a story and express your love for the great outdoors. This balance of creativity and symbolism will ensure your kitchen is not only beautiful but filled with meaning, serving as a true heart of the home.",1,1738112577.0,PaidOnlineJobs,0,1.0,False

1ichopn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ichopn/i_think_i_am_in_love_with_my_therapist_this_is/,I think I am in love with my therapist. This is stressing me out and makes me sad because it sucks.,"As the title says, I think I am in love with my therapist. She is AMAZING, and I am constantly thinking about her. I love everything about her.

I love how she understands me so well. When I say this, I don't mean that she provides a safe place for me and listens to everything I say because all therapists do that (or should). She understands me because she has been through the same or similar trauma. As someone who has been in therapy for more than 20 years and has done time in mental hospitals, I think I know when a psychiatrist or other mental health professional listens to me clinically vs. personally. I know when someone is listening to me like I am a textbook clinical case or when someone ""understands"" me. My therapist intuitively understands me in a way nobody has ever been able to. This isn't all conjecture; she has shared some personal trauma anecdotes with me. I know she understands me in a way that can't be attributed to simple psychology knowledge.

I love how supportive she is of me. In session, we hug and cry it out together. It feels like she is there for me in a way nobody has been before.

I love her quirky interests, tics, and habits. She is a self-declared ""plant mom"" to a hundred plants. She stims with a hair tie. When her ADHD is ""activated"" (I'm not sure of the correct term here), she can't sit still and has to start watering plants spontaneously. She often forgets, drops, trips, spills, or loses things, and sometimes, I wonder how anyone can be such a hot mess and still function as an adult.

I wouldn't say I ""love"" this about her, but she is beautiful! Not only is she a therapist, but she's also a certified Personal Trainer and Yoga Instructor. She's like a super-model. This makes her loud snort laugh even more adorable and funny because here is this super-model snort laughing, like, where the heck did that come from? LOL. She's downright a riot to talk to, especially if she starts snort laughing, and I do not laugh much around anyone.

She is one of the most perfectly imperfect people I've ever met. Just thinking about her makes me feel warm and happy.

*BUT SHE'S A THERAPIST!*

It is unethical for me to have feelings for a therapist, and it would be unethical for her to do anything with me. I'll never be anything but a client to her. That's how it is. After 20 years, I am well-versed in therapeutic ethics.

This sucks more than anyone can understand.

I can't make friends or develop normal relationships with other people. I was diagnosed early in childhood with epilepsy, Autism/PDD, speech impairment, and multiple learning disorders (including a language disorder), and I have struggled with self-harm since I was in the 3rd grade (I am 34 now).

Regular ""friend"" making advice doesn't work for me (if it works for anyone). People always say, ""Join a Club or a Class,"" ""Volunteer,"" ""Go for Walks,"" ""Exercise,"" ""Join a Meetup,"" or ""Find People with Similar Interests,"" like it is an instant solution to loneliness. It's become a cliché.

None of this has ever worked for me. I volunteer, join meetups, exercise, and meet people with similar interests. But nobody I have ever met through these activities has ever been put off by me any less because of whatever shared experience or interest we might have. People are visibly uncomfortable around me wherever I am. A shared interest, hobby, or experience changes nothing. Just because someone likes Jeeps, chess, bowling, books, travel, working out at the gym, or volunteering doesn't mean they are suddenly more accepting of me. People with similar interests are equally as put off and uncomfortable around me as anyone else. 

The ONLY people I have ever met who liked me enough to talk to me were people I met online, not in real life. But the Internet has changed so much since I was a kid, and I haven't had any more success online than in real life. 

The cold, hard truth is that I can't make friends. It is nearly impossible to meet someone who accepts me, much less likes me. 

This makes my feelings for my therapist so much worse. She accepts and understands me like nobody else ever has (definitely no other therapist in 20 years), but I'll never amount to anything more than a client. 

I wish I could get a coffee, watch a movie, hang out with her, and listen to her snort laugh. But it'll never happen. 

Some days, I surprise myself with how much of a loser I am. I feel eternally alone and rejected.

9 p.m. October 3, 1965 Diamantina Minas Gerais 

Jucelino Kubitschek was in his electoral base, thinking that his time was finally coming to return to the presidency, and after two terms of disastrous presidents that followed his first term he was ready to go back with it drinking a Chateau Margaux more when someone touches his shoulder, and after turning his head he sees Lott and says ""Good evening Lott how are you?"" Lott replies ""I'm fine but do you think we can lose the election?"" JK replies ""No, I don't think Jango did anything good apart from winning the war and the people see the UDN as supporters of the military, while I'm considered one of the best presidents and you're considered the Marshal who won us the war."" Lott says ""True, and do you also think that the Communists from the North will try to enter politics?"" JK replies, ""Maybe those Northeasterners and Northerners will elect a few mayors, but the left will never elect a president."" Lott pours himself a glass of wine and says, ""Maybe, but consider that they might distort it by saying that they were in favor of democracy"" JK says, ""Maybe, but I'm going to bed and I'll see the election results tomorrow."" Lott replies, ""Good night, if I can see you tomorrow we'll talk.""

Jucelino Kubitschek wakes up in his bed, gets up and opens his wardrobe, puts on a suit and walks to the kitchen to prepare a cup of coffee. After he finishes drinking his coffee, he goes to the garage, gets into his car and drives to the city center to buy a car, but on the way he sees several people celebrating, he stops at a newsstand where he pays the man for a newspaper and when he looks at the cover he sees **Jucelino Kubitschek returns to the presidency** and when he looks at the subtitle of the newspaper it says ""Jucelino Kubitschek of the PSD with 33.16 percent of the vote, João Goulart of the PTB with 31.35 percent of the vote, Ademar de Barros of the PSP with 22.39 percent of the vote and Jânio Quadros of the PTN with 13. 1 percent"" After seeing this, JK smiles and gets back into his car and drives home.",8,1738112378.0,AlternateHistory,1,0.9,False

Ever wondered what it feels like to stand out in public while immersed in your favorite game? Well, let me tell you about the time I unintentionally did not became the star of someone’s TikTok while playing Hoops on Apple Vision Pro (AVP) at Starbucks. Yes, it happened, and yes, it was as awkward as it sounds.

I was seated comfortably at my local Starbucks, sipping on a caramel macchiato and testing out Hoops, one of the coolest games on AVP. For those who haven’t tried it yet, Hoops is an augmented reality game that lets you shoot basketballs into virtual hoops, complete with physics so real you’ll feel like you’re on the court. It’s the kind of game that makes you forget the world around you—until the world reminds you it’s there.

As I was dunking my way through a new high score, I heard a faint giggle. I looked up (well, through the Vision Pro) to see a random girl in line pointing her phone at me, recording my every move. Apparently, my dedication to virtual basketball was too entertaining to pass up. Later, I found out she posted the video online with a caption like, ""When he’s more into his AR game than his coffee.""

The moment was both hilarious and humbling. It also made me think: what is it about AVP that makes us so captivating to others in public? Is it the sleek design of the headset? The immersive gestures? Or is it just that we look like futuristic explorers who’ve been transported from another dimension?

Here’s the real question for all my fellow AVP users out there: **Which game on Apple Vision Pro makes you stand out in public the most?** Is it Hoops? Tunic? Or maybe something even more immersive? Share your stories because I can’t be the only one with a Starbucks AR moment.

The beauty of AVP lies in its ability to blend the digital and physical worlds, but it also blurs the line between public and private experiences. Playing Hoops in Starbucks made me realize just how much curiosity this technology sparks. It’s not just about the game—it’s about how we interact with the world while using it.

For those interested in checking out my Starbucks AVP adventure, I’ve included the video in this post. And no, Starbucks hasn’t officially banned AVP users (yet). But who knows? If we keep shooting hoops and drawing crowds, it might become a ""thing.""

So, what’s your go-to AVP game for public spaces? Let me know in the comments below or maybe have a laugh or two along the way.

1ichjsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ichjsw/killer_60s/,Killer 60s,"I started renting this house a few weeks ago. It was a nice 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house with a 2 car garage and a sizable driveway. The grass was in very good health and the wooden fence was always painted a very bright and clean shade of white every few weeks. It was like a house from the 50s because it was. There was something charming about it, the wooden paneling, the porch with the backyard deck, the grill, the cozy little shack out back full of tools, and the lawnmower. I was allowed to rent this out for as long as I needed so I could write a report about a murder. One that happened in this very house in fact. Back in the 60s a couple lived here, they were crazy about each other. And about some of the neighbors as well. For over 2 decades they poisoned, stabbed, and shot various other families. It was never clear why they did it or what motives they had.

In the very end, it was chalked up as pure insanity, a pair of psychopaths married together. They had a son and daughter, but the grandparents had taken them out of that household after finding out about the first murder, they kept quiet. This house has been turned into a sort of museum and rental space over the past few years. It was closed off to the public for over 3 decades but recently opened back up for people to look at. Turns out that renting out and giving tours of a haunted house was profitable.

Oh, I forgot to mention that it was haunted by the souls of the couple who killed those families back in the day. This was something I was having a hard time documenting in the report I was writing. I mean, come on, a haunted house? What the hell is this, a horror novel? I was dead wrong about it though. It all started one night when this one song started playing on a phonograph in the living room. It was Put Your Head On My Shoulder by Paul Anka. I can't get it out of my head. It played over and over every night.

The nights would go the same way over and over. I would go to bed at around 10 PM. After that, the house would fall into an odd silence. The lights came on in the living room and that song would start playing itself. The movement of footsteps could be heard as they creaked against the hardwood floors.

""Please, come out and join us. It's quite a fine night."", a female voice would call out.

""Come now, be our guest, and take a seat out here. We'll drink tea and listen to the radio."", a male voice would soon follow up with the woman's voice.

It was not safe to get up and check it out, despite their words of assurance. Doing so could bring unknown results. It may have been safe, but something in my body told me otherwise. I would stay in bed until 6 AM, that's the time everything would fade away and turn to normal. Their little dance and music would go on all night, but I would still be able to sleep. While dozing off it seems like the music would go silent despite still playing. I guess their only goal at first is to draw you out.

It's been a few days of this before things took a step up. I've been hearing...people? It's almost like a party happened during the night hours. Again I find that I cease to hear it once I fall asleep. I guess these little events are mere attempts at giving incentives for me to leave the room rather than to torture me. Although every so often there'll be a knock on the door asking me to come out. It only lasts a second before the person walks away. They're very polite about it though and they don't stick around, merely ask me and then vanish once they don't hear an answer in 5 seconds.

During the daytime, I've been logging this information into my reports. I feel like I'm going insane slightly, these can't be real, right? I must be breathing some sort of hallucinogenic gas being pumped in here. Got the vents checked out, nothing wrong with them. They did need to be cleaned though so at least I had an excuse to get them worked on without looking like a crazy person. I never find a trace of this couple during the day. No shoes, footprints, altered objects, nothing. Not a single thing moved out of place or touched. Hell, things seem slightly cleaner in the morning. It may be the fact that I try to keep things as they are though.

I spend my days walking around the neighborhood. The people living around here are mostly millennials. The ones who either inherited these houses and chose to rent them out or live in them instead of selling them. Or renting them to cut down certain parts of the mortgage. I drive into the city and head to a coffee shop I like for a few hours. I leech off the free wifi so I can get my things done. There's free wifi at the house, but it's a gamble on the speeds and connection. I also like starting my day off with coffee and going about my hours getting cake and a few sandwiches.

It's now week 3 and I'm almost done. I was given 4 weeks before the deadline to make a report on this house so the people I work for can get some info. They're not exactly well informed since most of the people have either died, ""killed themselves"", or simply walked out after a few days. The only reason I've survived this long is that I read every last bit of data I could from both historical records and the half-assed papers people put together before throwing their badges to the side and working for another newspaper. I'm barely getting anything interesting so far aside from the fever dream of a stay I'm getting from this place.

These days during the third week have been weird. I wake up at the same time only to hear humming. Musical humming, no particular song, just random notes. This is the wife humming while making some sort of breakfast. Her name is Rose, and her husband is Clark. Can't believe I've been referring to them as the husband and the wife all this time. It changes during these days but it ranges from bacon and eggs to cereal and orange juice with toast to a full pancake breakfast. They got bigger and bigger every day. On day one I stayed in my room until the humming stopped. Only lasted for about 15-20 minutes. After that, I would check the kitchen to find a freshly cooked breakfast. Rose wasn't anywhere in sight though.

I was hesitant to eat it at first since I wasn't sure what would happen. But I was hungry that morning and didn't feel like making the drive to the city so early in the morning. The food was good and I didn't feel poisoned or anything. I would set the dishes in the sink and take a shower. Not even 15 minutes later after getting out of the shower and getting dressed, the dishes were washed, dry, and sitting in the cupboards. I'm honestly not sure why people have been dying or quitting this trip. So far I've stayed out of their way and never really messed with anything. I feel like a guest here and act as one which is probably the key here. You can't live here, merely stay for a certain amount of time. I don't know how long that time frame is though.

Week 4, these last 7 days are my final chances to wrap this up before the deadline. I am nowhere closer to finding out how these past journalists died, why this couple did what they did, or anything like that. The best I'm going to do is probably pump out a short guide on how not to die here. This week was the hardest. The haunting extends all day. You see, the morning would start off as normal like last week. Waking up, hearing the humming, waiting for it to stop, eating breakfast, putting the dishes in the sink, etc. The real difference is that they are now visible and active all day and night.

Clark spends his day sitting on an armchair reading a newspaper, funny detail is that the date of the newspaper follows our date, Only the month and day, not the year. He is always dressed in a white dress shirt with the top button left undone. Simple ironed black dress pants with a leather belt neatly wrapped around them. Brown leather shoes, more like loafers actually. The kind of dress shoes you slip on. They were always shined and clean. His right leg is on the floor with his left leg stretched over his right. The newspaper covered his face. The only thing that could be seen from the other side was the occasional cigarette smoke puffing up.

The cigarette never had a scent though, phantom tobacco, funny. Rose would be sitting on the couch most of the time either knitting, reading a magazine, or watching the TV. It was a large black and white tv, the outside made of hardwood, the thick glass of the display, and the antenna sticking out of the top. Can't miss those two large dials on it. There was always something different on TV, one moment it was a cooking show, the news, and even a Western movie. The volume was always able to be heard but sort of faint as well. Kind of like a sort of background noise you barely notice after a while.

It was not a good idea to verbally or physically interact with them in any way. Not even looking at them was an option. I've never seen either of their face outside of photos because I'm always staring at my phone, or laptop, even intentionally staring at the floor. The carpet was very pleasant to look at. They never spoke during the day. Rose would sometimes clean the house. Sometimes dusting, vacuuming, and even washing the dishes. I lied, I've caught small glimpses of their faces from reflections. They are in their young age from the 60s, the prime of their life right before the major kill streak.

I can't even explain any of this. This house could slowly be turning into a self-contained instance of time. But that wouldn't make sense since the wifi here works, my money is up to date, and my tech can be charged. A few of the outlets were swapped out for more modern ones. Only the ones not already connected to appliances or the TV itself. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner would always appear on the table at different times of the day. Breakfast at 6 AM, lunch at noon, and dinner at 6 PM. I would always eat in silence and put the dishes in the sink. I've tried rinsing the dishes before at least but the water never touched them. I don't know how to explain it, but I would turn on the water and it would just phase through the dishware. I gave up after one day.

Well, this is the final day. I'll be scheduling this report to send itself in a few hours. I don't even want to manually do it since I'm rinsing my hands off this worthless paperwork once I leave. There was one thing I wanted to check out though. I'm going to continue this bit on my phone.

I always wanted to check out the basement. I forgot that it even existed this whole time. The door wasn't blocked or locked at all luckily. The door opened just fine, but the lightbulb turned on for about a second before blowing out. It didn't actually explode, but the light sort of just flashed and burned out like a flashbang. The steps are quite loud as they creak. I'm not sure what this smell is, it's like a mixture of gas and...rotten meat?

The door just closed itself, the only light I have down here is from my phone flashlight. There's some kind of red puddle leading to a room down here. I'm not liking it. I'm writing this live so my boss can read this. Yes, I know, hard to believe I'm actually being productive.

This...this is blood. There's a body in here. No wait, multiple bodies down here. I can see dozens or even hundreds of flies just covering these bodies. I think I recognize some of the badges around the necks. All of these bodies smell fresh. Is time frozen down here or something?

...shit. There are footsteps coming down here. I'm squeezed behind a broken-down fridge, perhaps Clark will just give up his search in a few minutes. My 911 alert just failed. This one message will probably be the last thing that'll automatically upload. I think I just made a horrible mistake. I wasn't supposed to come down here. If you're reading this, please call for hel---

I recently got to rent out a home from the 60s. This house is famous because of a couple that used to live here from the 60s to the 80s. They were known for killing people and families during this time period before finally being caught by the police. These were the things I've learned during my stay in this house:

\- During the first week there will be dancing. From 10 PM to 6 AM there will be activity in the living room. The couple will appear out there and dance to a song called Put Your Head On My Shoulder along with a few others.

\- They will assure you that it's fine to come out and join them. Don't do it. I've never attempted so I don't know if anything happens, but trust your gut.

\- During week 2 they will start hosting a ""party"". The sound of many people will come from the living room as if people have come over for the evening. Every few hours the door will knock as someone on the other end will invite you to join everyone.

\- During week 3 the haunting will break into the day. During the morning the wife will be in the kitchen making breakfast, do not leave your room until she is done. You can use the bathroom, just don't look or enter the kitchen. You will hear her humming for about 20 minutes. Once it stops, you can go about your day. The food is perfectly fine to eat and is actually encouraged. Make sure you put your dishes in the sink.

\- During week 4, if you've survived this long, they will roam the house 24/7. Do not make eye contact with either of them. They'll mainly stay in the living room. The husband sitting on the armchair reading a newspaper and the wife reading a magazine or knitting. Occasionally she'll clean the house. If you are going to be in the living room, keep your eyes low and do not verbally interact with them.

\- If you do...I'm not sure. There have been reports of them killing people during this time. Acting hostile at them or trying to kill them will not end well. Many have rented this place out and almost all of them have died. Some were filled with stab wounds, some were in the tub, drowned, and others were framed as if it were suicide. You may wonder why the government hasn't merely torn the house down. I'm not sure. It seems like the money they make from this place keeps it running longer.

\- They will not force themselves into the room during the night. Unless you interact with them, they will not attack or come your way. Any food or snacks prepared is fully safe and encouraged to consume. Make sure you set dishes and silverware in the sink. They'll be cleaned when you're not working. Staying outside of the house is your best chance to live. Follow these rules.",1,1738112031.0,scarystories,1,0.67,False

1. There has been a big debate about whether Elisabeth and Sue share the same consciousness—whether they are truly one “you are one” or simply different versions of the same being. Has this ever been officially confirmed or denied?

Points in favor: Elisabeth knew Sue’s name the first time she woke up without being told or having read it anywhere. When old Elisabeth was terminating the experiment, she thought about “our big night” and that made her stop the terminating process. Also, if they did not share the same consciousness, what would Elisabeth gain from all of this? If they were separate beings, she would likely use The Substance, realize they were not one, and stop using it altogether cause she had nothing to gain with it. 

Points against: After Sue was with the first guy at Elisabeth’s house, Elisabeth seemed surprised by the mess—later, Sue was also surprised by the state of Elisabeth’s kitchen. Elisabeth also appeared shocked when she realized the guy Sue had been with was the same one she saw wearing the helmet—if they shared a consciousness, she would already know him and would not be that shocked, right? Later, when Sue was on TV giving an interview, Elisabeth mocked her answers, suggesting that they do not share a consciousness, as she wouldn’t know what Sue had said. Lastly, if they shared the same consciousness, would Sue deliberately harm Elisabeth like that miss using The Substance on purpose?

2. This might be a bit silly, but how did they actually know how to properly use The Substance, considering the instructions weren’t very detailed? Besides that, Sue also seemed to have knowledge of how to use it—knowledge that Elisabeth had learned. Could this be a clue that they share the same consciousness after all?

3. How did old Elisabeth manage to run so fast outside? And how did she even outrun Sue inside the house, running from the living room to the bathroom?

4. This is not a question but rather an observation—or possibly a continuity mistake. When Elisabeth was at the coffee shop, she ordered a mocha latte. Then, as she started speaking with the older version of the doctor, the coffee suddenly appeared on the table, even though the waitress had never delivered it.

5. How did Sue have so much strength to kick old Elisabeth so far—sending her flying from the stairs all the way to the table?

6. How did Monster Elisa-Sue went from Elisabeth’s house to the TV studio? And assuming Sue had been missing for a long time—given the fight and everything that happened inside the house—how did the show continues as planned? How were they expecting Sue to appear right at the exact moment she was supposed to start presenting, when she had been missing for at least a couple of hours?

**Summary:** *While it is an investment, the 7th Avenue Modular Sofa is 100% worth it. It meets all the criteria for sustainability, ethics, and non-toxic certifications. It’s also among the most versatile modular sofas available, offering countless configurations to suit your needs. Additionally, it’s effortless to clean and designed for everyday comfort. It truly does offer a “cloud-like” experience!*

# Pros

* The covers and fabrics for the [7th Avenue Modular Sofa](https://7thavenue.sjv.io/c/274622/1686529/19563?subId1=df-web-rw-&u=https%3A%2F%2F7thavenue.co%2Fcollections%2Fsectionals%2Fproducts%2F4-seat-sectional) modular sofa are OEKO-TEX certified, third-party tested, and formaldehyde-free, and free from flame retardants. The base is made from FSC-certified wood.
* The modular sofa has numerous configuration possibilities, and you can add on or downsize to fit different spaces and seasons of life.
* You can also change out the covers, which are washable, and coated with a nontoxic DWR coating technology. In my experience, I found that the couch was resistant to spills, stains, and daily debris.
* While a bit more expensive ($2950+), 7th Avenue sofas will last a lifetime and are made to grow with you over time for long-term savings and sustainability.
* If you’re in LA, you can opt to have the couch assembled by 7th Avenue’s delivery team. That’s what I did, but self-assembly seemed easily doable!

# Cons

* While the sofa is more affordable than some high-end options like the Restoration Hardware cloud couch, its significant price tag might be a deterrent for those on a tighter budget.
* The color selection is relatively limited compared to other brands that offer a wider range of upholstery choices. Options include white, black, and heather grey.

I’m not usually one to fall for TikTok trends. But last year, I found myself scrolling through videos of [cloud couches](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/cloud-couch?lang=en) in high-rise apartments and sun-filled living rooms. Something about the oversized cushions and neutral aesthetic drew me in, despite my usual taste for darker tones and mid-century decor.

My husband and I had just moved into a new apartment where, sadly, our beloved velvet green couch no longer fit. The two-seater sofa was swallowed by the size of the room. After much reluctance, we sold it, then began searching for cloud couch lookalikes and dupes to fill our space. (The real thing from Restoration Hardware costs upwards of $10k. No thanks.)

But even as I scoured secondhand listings, I struggled to justify buying a couch with questionable materials. Many are filled with goose down, and sofa covers are [often treated with toxic repellents](https://www.livingetc.com/news/is-your-sofa-harming-you). Sustainability is always at the top of my list, but nontoxic is an absolute must when it comes to bedding and fabric furniture. 

After months of searching, I came across [7th Avenue](https://7thavenue.sjv.io/c/274622/1686529/19563?subId1=df-web-rw-&u=https%3A%2F%2F7thavenue.co%2F), a new*ish* furniture company launched in 2022 with claims to have made “The World’s Greatest Modular Sofa.” And the couch seemed to meet my requirements for sustainability, ethics, *and* natural materials. 

>“7th Avenue, a new*ish* “7th Avenue, a new*ish* furniture company launched in 2022 with claims to have made ‘The World’s Greatest Modular Sofa.'”

  
For example, the covers and fabrics are OEKO-TEX certified, third-party tested, and formaldehyde-free (they use water-based glue instead). The LA-based brand doesn’t use flame retardant chemicals either, according to California laws, which have been known to be carcinogenic and toxic. As for the cushions, they are filled with a premium down alternative, making the couch hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. 

The frame is FSC-certified too. 7th Avenue crafts its couches in Indonesia using Indonesian solid wood for construction — highly regarded as one of the strongest types of wood in the market. The brand is also making efforts to reduce waste by reusing and recycling as many packaging materials as possible.

Best of all, 7th Avenue’s cloud couch dupe is half the price of the real thing, starting at $2950+. I decided to go for it.

# Delivery & setup

One of the biggest selling points of 7th Avenue is the delivery and setup options. I’ve spent too many hours of my life carting couches across cities and putting them together like Ikea furniture. It once took us an entire afternoon to figure out how to get a sofa up two flights of narrow stairs. Let’s just say it involved a skateboard and some pulleys.

Because I live within a 60-mile radius of 7th Avenue’s LA warehouse, I opted to have their delivery team help with setup. (If you live outside of the area, you can still get help with this; they just use a verified third-party assembler.) The brand contacted me via call and follow-up email to schedule and confirm a date and time. In the morning, I received a text from the driver confirming they were on their way. 

When a small van arrived at my apartment, I was curious to know where the couch was. Surely it didn’t fit in there? But the two delivery workers explained that everything was in boxes for easy transport and setup. This also means the possibility of expanding or downsizing the couch in the future — a feature I love.

I had opted for the [4-Seat Modular Corner Sectional](https://7thavenue.sjv.io/c/274622/1686529/19563?subId1=df-web-rw-&u=https%3A%2F%2F7thavenue.co%2Fcollections%2Fsectionals%2Fproducts%2F4-seat-sectional) with the chaise, and aside from answering questions about where I’d like to couch and which side I’d prefer the corner on (it’s interchangeable and can be left or right facing), the setup team handled everything. It took about an hour, and I got to drink coffee and read a book, all while the 7th Avenue team transformed my living room into a luxurious TikTok loft.

Once finished, they showed me how to attach and detach each piece for future configurations and left me with a bag of down inserts to create fluffier cushions if I wanted. Then they took the boxes away, leaving me with a new couch. It was a 15/10 experience. 

A note for DIYers: While putting the sofa together without a setup team may be intimidating, it’s definitely doable. Each piece is easy to move around and assemble, and the cushion covers go on seamlessly. The brand notes that each seat takes about 10-15 minutes for assembly.

# Comfort & functionality rating

Of course, a couch can look beautiful and luxurious, but the real question remains: Is it comfortable? My husband and I *loved* our last sofa, so the bar was set high for the 7th Avenue modular sectional. I’m happy to report that I sunk in and napped as soon as the delivery team left. The reviews and hype were spot on. While this wasn’t *the* cloud couch, it was a cloud couch, and I was quickly in love. 

We’ve enjoyed our new sofa for about a month now, and the comfort level keeps improving as it adjusts to our bodies and home. The cushions are firm and supportive while giving you a “cloud-like” feel. It’s easy to move around too, and I’ve rearranged configurations multiple times on my own — I love that you can bring the chaise over to the corner section to create a mini-bed for movie nights or guests. We even had friends sleep on it for five nights while visiting, and it was way better than a pullout or even a fancy air mattress. Just make sure you use the included screws to attach the pieces once it’s set to prevent any sliding. 

[Pro tip: Get the extra throw pillows for additional back support or to prop up your legs. ](https://preview.redd.it/23m04a2owtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=401a9acd4a9d78a827340ce85421f0b1fe5888be)

# Caring for the sofa

When I told my friends I’d opted for a white sofa after years with a very forgiving velvet green couch, they laughed. While we don’t have children, and our dog knows that furniture is off-limits, white is white. 

That said, 7th Avenue has promised a durable fabric solution.

“Our DWR coating technology is unique because we are taking a feature that is commonly used in outdoor jackets and applying them to indoor upholstery,” the brand told me in an interview. “Our fabrics do not easily absorb liquid but can be easily cleaned if stained. \[They\] are also removable and washing machine safe.” 

In other words, the sofa is spill and stain-resistant, which has been our experience so far. The few times we’ve gotten dirt on the couch, it’s wiped off easily, and I’ve invested in a handheld upholstery steamer — just in case.

I’m still hesitant as I get used to it and put down blankets when eating. But I’ll be eager to see how the covers wash in the future. If white is too terrifying, the 7th Avenue sofas come in black and heather grey. You can even change out your covers in the future, further prolonging the life of our couch.

As for PFAS and microplastics, I asked the brand about them since it’s such a pertinent discussion right now, especially with waterproof fabrics. I was pleased to hear they are committed to being free from microplastics, PFC, PFAS, and PFOA in 2023. 

“Several states have legislation that bans microplastics such as PFAS and PFOA from household products by 2025. As a fast-growing upstart in the furniture industry, we believe we can do this much faster than legacy players,” they said. 

# Changing out the covers

One of my favorite features of the 7th Avenue couch is the fact that you can change out the covers and essentially have an entirely new couch. The company has multiple fabric alternatives and colors, including premium performance velvet, woven chenille, classic crossweave, and textured weave. (Keep an eye out for limited color drops too!

https://preview.redd.it/5696jztvwtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e8bdf4defde86e221df32fd4098383610e6ab7

[I love how easy it is to swap out the covers without needing to replace the entire couch.](https://preview.redd.it/07ide7atwtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd4dcc2077cd7584d827f4c40b7931f517ca66cb)

Of course, when opting to try out the cover set for our couch, I knew I wanted something bold and moody to contrast the modern white we originally ordered. You can see in the photos below how we transformed our couch (and the feel of our living space) with the olive green velvet. It’s softer than the textured weave, and though all 7th Avenue covers are washable, it definitely hides more than the white.

Having an additional cover set also allows us to switch out the covers during different seasons or if we want to give the couch covers a deeper clean. When not in use, they fold up and store easily in our hall closet. I highly recommend this option to anyone who wants to freshen up their couch without buying a new one!

[The difference between the two colors. We also made the couch a bit smaller and moved the other half into our bedroom for a loveseat—there is so much versatility!](https://preview.redd.it/o1b9o1xywtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=566d4224eb1b69985b9cd277067b093b5a6b027c)

# Final thoughts: Is the couch worth it? 

The short answer is yes. While this sofa is far from “cheap,” I think it’s 100% worth the investment. It checks all of the boxes in terms of sustainability, ethics, and nontoxic certifications. It’s arguably one of the most functional modular sofas on the market, with endless configurations and options for you and your family to grow. Plus, it’s easy to clean and made for everyday snuggles — kids and pets included.  

“Modular sofas are truly great for sustainability and longevity because they can be used as customers’ lifestyles change,” 7th Avenue said. 

“For example, those living in apartments or smaller spaces will likely purchase modular sofas with a smaller configuration. Once they move to a larger space or a single-family home, they can simply add modular pieces to make their sofas larger \[meaning\] they do not have to discard the older smaller sofa that they had and buy a new one.” 

It’s a money-saving and environmental win.

1ichanw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ichanw/furologee_cd013c_desk_with_power_outlet_review/,Furologee CD013-C desk with power outlet review,"I’ve had my fair share of desks over the years, but the Furologee CD013-C L-Shaped Desk definitely caught my attention. The rustic brown finish with its industrial style sold me right away, and I couldn’t resist trying it out for my home office. The moment it arrived, I was eager to put it together and see if it lived up to the buzz it’s been getting. Spoiler alert: it’s not perfect, but it’s close!

**Design & Build Quality**  
This desk is a looker. The rustic brown laminated finish gives it a warm, homey vibe, while the metal frame adds a modern industrial touch. It feels sturdy, though I wouldn’t go jumping on it (not that you should with any desk). The materials are impressive for the price, and I’ve been using it daily for work and gaming without any wobbling or sagging. I did notice that the drawers are made of fabric, which might not scream “premium,” but they’re lightweight and functional.

**Size & Space**  
Measuring 66.14 inches wide and 29.52 inches tall, it’s plenty spacious for my dual-monitor setup, laptop, and even a printer. The L-shape design fits snugly into the corner of my room, maximizing space without feeling overwhelming. If you have a small office or bedroom, this desk fits like a puzzle piece. The reversible design is a neat touch too—you can set it up to suit your room’s layout.

**Functionality & Features**  
The Furologee CD013-C desk comes equipped with three power outlets and two USB charging ports. This has been a game-changer for me, as I no longer have to fumble with extension cords or crawl under the desk to charge my gadgets. The two movable monitor stands are genius—they let me position my monitors at eye level, saving my neck from hours of strain.

Storage is another area where this desk shines. The adjustable shelves are perfect for my gaming console and speakers, while the upgraded fabric file drawer has enough space for my important documents. However, I did find the fabric drawers a bit flimsy for heavy files, so don’t expect them to handle a ton of weight.

**Assembly**  
I won’t lie—assembling this desk was a bit of a process. The instructions are clear, and each part is labeled, but it’s definitely a two-person job. It took me two hours with the help of my partner. If you’re going solo, set aside extra time and maybe prep a playlist to keep yourself entertained.

**Pros**

* The rustic brown aesthetic is both stylish and versatile.
* Built-in charging ports are a lifesaver for tech lovers.
* The desk is spacious yet compact enough for smaller spaces.
* Reversible design allows for customization based on room layout.
* Movable monitor stands are a thoughtful addition.

**Cons**

* Fabric drawers, while functional, feel a bit cheap compared to the rest of the desk.
* Assembly can be time-consuming and requires two people for efficiency.
* The desk’s surface isn’t heat-resistant—my warm coffee mug left a faint mark.
* Monitor stands are not fixed and can slide around if bumped.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to desks like the Cubiker L-Shaped Desk or the Walker Edison Soren desk, the Furologee CD013-C stands out for its built-in charging station and adjustable shelves. The Cubiker desk is slightly easier to assemble and has fixed monitor stands, but it lacks the premium features like charging ports and fabric file drawers. Walker Edison’s option offers a more modern aesthetic but at a higher price point and with less storage.

One area where the Furologee falls behind its competitors is the quality of the drawers. While the fabric drawers are lightweight and functional, they don’t hold up to heavier wooden or metal drawers found in higher-end desks.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
For what you’re getting, the Furologee CD013-C is a solid investment. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but the features and design make it a good bang for your buck. If you’re looking for a desk with ample storage, a unique look, and built-in tech conveniences, this one ticks all the boxes. While it’s not without its flaws, the pros far outweigh the cons in my book.
