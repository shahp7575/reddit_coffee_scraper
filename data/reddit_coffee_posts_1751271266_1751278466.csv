As someone who values both convenience and flexibility in my kitchen gadgets, the BELLA 35126-043A initially caught my eye with its sleek design and promise of versatility. I’ve got limited countertop space, and this machine’s compact profile integrates seamlessly without making my kitchen feel cluttered. Beyond its understated matte finish in the Oatmilk shade, which looks modern and chic, the device feels sturdy given its lightweight design of just under four pounds. Its slim build is perfect for those with small kitchens or who appreciate a minimalist aesthetic.

**Effortless Operation**

Using this single-serve coffee maker has been a straightforward experience from the first brew. Its fully automatic operation means that even on groggy mornings, a fresh cup of coffee is just a simple one-touch away. I appreciate that it doesn’t require any complex programs or settings to get started. You choose either ground coffee or coffee pods thanks to its dual compatibility features. The included reusable grounds filter has been a money-saver and eco-friendly alternative to disposable pods, which I love since I’ve tried to minimize waste. Whether I’m in the mood for a rich blend of ground beans or the convenience of a K-Cup, this machine accommodates my preference seamlessly.

**Adjustable Drip Tray for Convenience**

The adjustable drip tray is such an underrated feature, but it genuinely makes a difference during my busy mornings. Whether I’m brewing into a petite coffee cup or taller travel mug, the tray adjusts to accommodate sizes up to seven inches. There’s no risk of spills or overflow, which I’ve dealt with in other machines before. On days when I’m running late, being able to brew directly into my go-to travel mug saves me precious time.

**Quick and Customizable Brewing**

I’ve been impressed with how quickly this coffee maker brews. In under five minutes, I can have anywhere from a petite 6-ounce pour to a larger 14-ounce mug ready. This range in size customizability suits different needs – the smaller serving for an afternoon pick-me-up and a larger one to start my mornings right. Additionally, the 1000-watt power ensures each brew is hot and flavorful, which isn’t always the case with compact machines.

**Strengths**

- Compact footprint perfect for small kitchens or dorm rooms  
- Dual compatibility with coffee pods and ground coffee  
- Adjustable drip tray for flexibility with various mug sizes  
- Fast brewing speed under five minutes  
- Eco-friendly reusable filter included  

**Areas for Concern**

While the BELLA single-serve machine has become a staple in my kitchen, there are some small annoyances.  

- The water tank isn’t removable, making it a little tricky to fill.  
- It’s slightly noisier than other machines I’ve tried.  
- Some taller mugs can feel wobbly on the drip tray, especially when brewing near maximum capacity.  

**Cleaning Made Simple**

Cleanup has been refreshingly hassle-free compared to similar products I’ve used. The reusable filter, coffee pod adapter, and drip tray are all dishwasher safe, which means I don’t spend extra time scrubbing. If you’re someone who dreads post-coffee cleanup (guilty), this feature will win you over.

**Product Comparisons**

Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, which I’ve also had the chance to try, the BELLA model holds its own remarkably well. While the Keurig feels a little sturdier overall, it lacks the height adjustability feature that makes the BELLA more versatile for different mug sizes. On the other hand, the Keurig’s removable water tank makes refills quicker. If you’re prioritizing convenience and budget, the BELLA is a fantastic alternative without compromising core features like brewing speed and compatibility. 

**Value for Money**

Is this coffee maker worth its price? Absolutely. While not as feature-packed as some high-end brands, it delivers exceptional value for its price point. Between the reusable filter, compact design, and quick brewing process, it feels like a well-rounded machine for anyone who wants a reliable single-serve experience without breaking the bank. Its affordable quality and eco-friendly features make it an accessible option for budget-conscious buyers.

1lo3qnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1lo3qnd/should_you_get_the_hd6xx/,Should you get the HD6XX?,"Hello. In this post I seek to provide information for those considering buying the HD6XX as an entry to the audiophile world as well as to clear up some of the confusions I myself faced when deciding about them.

So, should you buy the HD6XX?

TLDR: YES!

A bit of context:

\-The HD6XX is my first expirence with high quality, open back headphones. Before them I had listenned to the Fiio FH3.

\-HD6XX are driven by my topping dx3 pro+ (an excellent dac imo)

Lets explore together some areas I have came across before purchasing:

1) Comfort

\-They are very comfortable. The clamping force wears in after a few days. 

\-Not exactly friendly to my glasses tho. I have to always lift up my glasses up on the padding. Mainly because the pads make an awful sound every time they move against my glasses. 

\-Also sometimes there is a pressure spot on the top of my head but it is no big deal.

\-Their weight is a big factor. Having headphones this light is a pleasure to wear.

2) Sound

Lets take it from the bass up:

\-Before I had listenned to them for the first time I expected them to have no bass at all. This could not be further from the truth. Bass lines (I am talking mainly about the instrument) are clear, very well defined and pronounced. There is no shortage of well articulated bass lines (In for example Abba or Queen, even orchestral music.)

\-What they lack is the deepest of subbase. If you listen to Billie Eilish for her bass, the HD6XX does  not offer the rumble, detail and impact on the verry bottom of the bass.

Mid range:

\-Just excellent. The clarity and authority with which theese headphones deliver sound is other-wordly. Althought what confuses me is the frequent opinion that vocals are especially great on theese. For me the instruments (Violins, pianos, guitars, ...) sound just as good as the voices (Adelle - Skyfall).

Trebble:

\-This is my cup of coffee. I personally am very sensitive to cymbals which often sound like piercing my soul. Not here though. They are tame and very pleasing to listen to. Other instruments such as trombones and trumpets are also very enjoyable (BBC Big Band).

Now some miscellanios stuff:

Sound stage:

\-I am torn on this topic. Sometimes I could swear some sound came tens of meters away from me an other times the whole song happens only between the drivers.

\-I do feel the need to exercise the difference I have felt from the nature of the headphones being open back. The whole music expirence suddenly feels like ""blobs"" of sound that are placed around you. You can tell that there is space between them and it is a very natural as well as pleasing feeling.

Imaging and precision:

\-Unbeliavable. Every sound has its place. Even when listennning to entire orchestras (Zimmer, Two steps from hell, Nightwish), you can clearly hear each section. If you want to, you can very precisley focus on any single element of the music (The violin section, the oboe solo, the piano in the background). If the track allows it, no sound is lost due to being mixed with another. 

Immersion:

\-Listenning is a very focused experience. So far when I use them I sit down, close my eyes and listen to them with most focus on the music, fully immersed in the sound.

Emotions:

\-When using them I feel like I am listenning to the song, not to the headphone. They are very revealing and it feels like the headphone serves you each individual frequency on a silver platter for you to taste and enjoy. From what I have read, my combo with dx 3 pro+ is sterile and clinical for some. I do see where they are coming from yet this is exactly what I enjoy. 

Nonetheless, when I play Apocalyptica - Nothing else matters, the sound is very lively and gives me extraordinary emotions.

3) Other day to day usage notes:

\-You can really hear everything happening around you. I expected this to be a problem but mostly it is not. That is because with a reasonoble volume you do not get distracted much. Also the sounds I hear are usually ones I am used to anyways. It is simmilar to listenning to speakres. Plus if you stop your music, you do not need to takem them off when talking to someone.

\-Youtube is not great with theese. You can hear the awful sound design and/or master in most yt videos which is very distracting (ofc not talking about music, but youtube watching).

\-Some song just sound horrible. A terribly mastered song is going to sound terrible. I have disliked some songs on the HD6XX because I started hearing the bad master. Related to this is the fact that sometimes you start hearing new sounds to and you stop liking the song because of them.

\-Sound bleed: Not a big problem. My partner says it does not distract her when I listen to music. Only while studying or needing extra focus, she asks me to stop.

\-Gaming: Not a fan. I have played little on theese so far, but from what I have experienced, they are not very good. For some reason I am often confused about where the footsteps are coming from (CS2, Valorant). This is weird because in music the imaging is razor sharp.

\-Final thoughts:

At first I wanted the edition XS. Then I have decided for the HD6XX mainly for its reputation in durability. I wanted to fall in love with my first headphones and not to be broken hearted when they break after a few months.

Shipping to centreal Europe (Czech Republic) took about two weeks and I had to pay VAT. The overall price was around 250USD, everything included. The topping was about 190USD, used on amazon de. That brings the budget to around 340USD.

Lastly, I have compiled a playlist consisting of songs that sound remarkable on the headphone. That is because I have struggled to determine whether the headphones are good for the type of music I was buying them for. If you find your favourite song/band in the playlist, you can be certain that it is going to sound awesome on your headphone.

Hoy Jayson na taga-Dagupan… kung nababasa mo ‘to, bahala ka na sa buhay mo!
MANLOLOKO ka. Ako pa ginawa mong panakip sa kakulangan ng jowa mong cashier?! Ginawa mo pa akong side character sa sarili kong love story.

Hi Pokoyo. Itago mo na lang ako sa pangalang Rina, 22, taga-Mangaldan.
Wala akong balak umamin sa confession page na ‘to, pero heto tayo. Nadala ng katangahan at promo ng kilig.

Nakilala ko si Jayson sa comment section ng isang meme page tungkol sa mga lingo ng taga-Pangasinan. Simple lang: nag-reply siya sa comment ko tungkol sa “timplang tamang sinigang,” nagka-chat, nagkapalitan ng kwento, playlist, coffee reco, life trauma, future plans.
Alam mo ‘yung smooth but not creepy? ‘Yung nakakatawa pero hindi pilit?
Ang sarap ka-chat. Parang saktong lakas ng ulan  hindi nakakatamad, hindi rin nakakabingi. Chill lang.

Two weeks kaming halos hindi nauubusan ng topic. Hanggang sa niyaya niya akong magkita.
Sabi niya, “Tara, mall lang. Grocery lang tayo. Chill.”
Ako naman, in denial pa sa kilig. “Sige, friendly lang ‘to. Hindi date.”

Nagkita kami sa isang mall sa Dagupan.
He came prepared: naka-white shirt, faded jeans, may eco bag. Gwapo in a subtle way. Malinis, mabango, hindi nakaka-intimidate.
Sabi niya, “Gusto ko lang may makasama mag-grocery. Masaya kasi ‘pag may kausap.”
Ako, wow. Soft boy? Family man? Husband material?

Ang saya.

Naglalakad kami sa grocery habang nagtatalo kung anong brand ng sinigang mix ang mas masarap, nagtatawanan habang pinipili kung regular o spicy noodles.
Sabi ko, “Wag ‘yan, may aftertaste.”
Sabi niya, “Next time ikaw na lang pipili ng lahat, mas okay ka pala sa ganito.”

NEXT TIME.
Diyan ako muntik nang bumagsak.
‘Yung tipong pinaniwala mo na baka may ""sunod na kabanata.""

Pero hindi ko alam, epilogue na pala ‘to.

Dumating na kami sa cashier.
Tahimik.
May kakaiba sa cashier. Babaeng chinita, may bags sa mata, naka-mask, pero 'yung mata niya  galit, pero hindi iyak.
Tinignan niya si Jayson, tapos sinabi niya:

> “Dito ka pa talaga dumiretso?”

Ako? Hawak ko ‘yung corned beef.
Si Jayson? Nakatulala. Hindi makatingin sa’kin.

Tinanong ko, “Girlfriend mo siya?”
Walang sagot. Ilang segundo.
Hanggang sa may pa-hinang boses na sabi niya:

> “It’s complicated.”

Complicated pala ha.
Ang simple ng lakad natin pero ang gulo ng konsensya mo.

Nilapag ko ‘yung hawak ko. Tumalikod ako.
Hindi ako gumawa ng eksena. Hindi ako nagbato ng de-latang sardinas kahit gusto ko.
Lumabas ako ng grocery.
Proud ako.
Pero habang naglalakad ako paakyat sa overpass, sabay sabay din akong binigat puso, pride, at paa ko kasi naka-sandals ako na manipis ang talampakan.

That night, nag-message siya. Ang haba ng explanation.

 “Wala na talaga kami.”
“Naghiwalay na kami weeks ago.”
“Nagkataon lang na siya ‘yung cashier.”
“Masaya akong kasama ka.”

Alam mo ‘yung gusto mong maniwala, pero may part ng utak mo na gusto na lang matulog?
Ganun.

Masaya daw siya kasama ako.
Ako rin naman. Masaya ako.
Masaya ako sa “akala.”
Masaya ako sa “pwedeng tayo.”
Pero ang hindi ko na kayang ulitin…
‘Yung masaya siya, pero hindi ako ‘yung choice niya.

Nag-grocery kami ng future jowa ko…
Eh jowa na pala siya ng cashier.
Sa susunod na may magyaya sa akin mag-grocery,

The city was calm, fortunately the weather was sunny and lovely people.

The people were/felt a bit cold in the beginning, but just chatting with them a bit and they really open up and start talking a lot.  The food was amazing, danish pastries and coffees were as people mentioned they would be.

1. It felt like the city had life- the studios, museums and the street food, absolutely wonderful and amazing.

2. Took a day trip to Louisiana museum and loved the museum area with the garden- modern art isn’t my favourite but the garden was worth it. Then, took a train to Helsingor, enjoyed the church, had great food at the street market. 

3. Took a day trip to Dragør. OMG, loved sitting next to the sea reading books. Had the nicest seafood at one of the cafes there.

I was walking 20kms everyday. Hostel was better than most hotels I’ve stayed in.

The only bad thing was- it was mad expensive. Like literally. Latte and a cinnamon bun was about 100-120kr which was a bit too steep for me. However, as a tourist, it was alright for 3 days.

Currently in Majorca, spain and the weather is so hot. Before the trip, I was so excited about Majorca and a tad bit uninterested about Copenhagen. Now, hands down, best part of my trip was talking trains through quaint towns, having a cup of coffee, and just enjoying reading a book next to the sea in Denmark.

A lovely woman comes and kneels in front of me and gently asks if I would like a cup of tea and a biscuit. I look up and see her and the tea & coffee trolly. At that moment I just wanted to weep. My whole day had been one long stressful event after another and her kindness just broke me.

After she left, I realised the I had just met an angel. Every single thing about her was pure love and compassion. It came from her in waves and wrapped me in a big warm emotional blanket.

The thing is, I still don't believe in angels as described in the bible. But I believe in entities that are pure light and love and who exist just to be there at the right time and place. ",2,1751277614.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

And I have to say — that seems to be 100% true in my case. I’ve had absolutely no side effects so far.

To give a bit of context: I was diagnosed with insulin resistance two months ago, and I drastically changed my diet *before* starting Metformin. Here’s what I’ve been doing consistently:

* No processed foods
* No sugar (except for some fruit)
* No heavy carb-based meals — maybe the occasional white bread when eating out and there’s no other option
* Low-GI eating *almost every day*
* Little to no alcohol
* Lots of fiber and protein, and I cook most of my meals

I think this way of eating really helped prepare my gut/microbiome. I’ve even tested Metformin with things like coffee on an empty stomach (with milk), sparkling water, bread, etc. — and still, nothing to report. No nausea, no stomach upset, no change in digestion.

I should also mention I didn’t have any gut issues or irregular digestion before starting — except when I ate way too much greasy carbs or melted cheese (perks of living in Switzerland) — which probably helps too.

So, while I’m obviously not a medical expert, I really believe that if you don’t already have major digestive issues, and you adjust your diet a bit beforehand, you might tolerate Metformin way better than expected.

I hope this reassures some of you who are nervous about starting it! :)",4,1751277340.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

That's a brutal ₹1,600+ drop from when it was flirting with ₹1 lakh just last week.

Classic gold behavior though - rockets up on geopolitical drama, then face-plants once everyone remembers markets exist beyond headlines.

# What triggered this bloodbath?

The usual suspects:

* **Ceasefire vibes**: Israel-Iran tensions cooled off, so everyone's dumping their ""end of world"" hedge
* **Dollar doing dollar things**: USD weakened globally, dragging gold down with it
* **Profit vultures**: Smart money clearly ""sold the news"" right at that psychological ₹1L mark

Now we're testing that ₹94-96K support zone. Question is - will it hold?

# The numbers don't lie

|Market|Current|1m High|% Drop|YTD Gains|2-Year Run|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Global (COMEX)**|$1,950/oz|$2,045|\-4.6%|\+6%|\+30%|
|**India (MCX)**|₹95,979/10g|₹101,000|\-4.9%|\+7%|\+47%|

India's still outperforming global markets over the long haul. That ₹47% two-year gain vs. 30% globally? Our rupee weakness + local demand keeping us ahead.

# Here's where it gets interesting...

Been tracking Polymarket's predictions on gold's 2025 close. Right now:

* **Under ₹97K**: 62¢ odds
* **Over ₹97K**: 38¢ odds
* Daily volume: \~$120K

That 24¢ spread favouring the bears? Pretty much mirrors today's technical breakdown. The crowd's betting gold ends 2025 below current levels.

# My watchlist for the next few days:

1. **₹94-95K zone**: If this breaks, we might see ₹92K faster than expected
2. **Fed minutes drop**: Any hawkish surprises could pile more pressure
3. **Polymarket flip**: If ""Under"" odds drop below 58¢, might be time for a contrarian play

# Real talk - what's your move?

Are you:

* Backing up the truck on physical gold right now?
* Playing MCX futures for a bounce?
* Betting on Polymarket (and if so, which side)?

**Drop your thoughts below - are we catching a falling knife or getting a genuine discount? What are your local rates looking like?**",2,1751277240.0,u_opinion_dexgamer,1,1.0,False

Yesterday I posted about how sad I've been these past few days and today I saw this dream. I was shopping with my mother and the place we went to was very interesting. The stores were next to each other and the exit was connected to the entrance of another store. While we were both walking around, I entered a jewelry store, the walls were burgundy and the lights were light pink. It was a place that sold diamond jewelry and there were so many beautiful necklaces, key chains, etc. that I was amazed. Then I left the store to go somewhere else and approached the window and looked down. There was a huge and wide theater hall and people were sitting and watching something. Like the colors of the library, the colors here are also coffee tones. I want to go there too and I follow the people who were going and go downstairs. Then I see my friends there and I go right next to them. I sit in front of them and there is another man next to me, in my dream this man is also a friend of ours but there is no such person in real life. What the people were watching was a singer singing.  I start watching too and then I look at the guy next to me, he looks at me and smiles and suddenly leans over and kisses my cheek. I want to kiss him too and then he comes closer to me and kisses me on the lips. Then he grabs my chin and starts kissing me harder and more passionately. Then we leave and continue to watch the singer laughing. My friends are shocked because they didn't expect to see something like this, but then my best girlfriend says ""Finally..."" This guy, who I don't know in real life, turns into my ex-lover, whom I think of as my twin flame, while kissing, and my friends even call him by my ex-lover's name.

Way more stable mood. Being happy at work for a change.

So I sat there like... why am I PAYING real money, in this economy, for glorified tree napkins that I literally throw away 30 seconds later? 💀

I did the math. $1.50 per roll, maybe 2-3 rolls a week because apparently I’m running a diner with 12 invisible children. That’s $200+ a year to wipe crap off surfaces. And we’re out here talking about student loans and rent going up like we don’t have a literal garbage budget.

So I snapped. I grabbed a pair of scissors and went full chaos goblin on an old (ugly) t-shirt from college. Boom. Instant reusable cloths. I made like 20 in 10 minutes. No hemming, no cute Pinterest vibes. Just rage and scissors.

I’ve been using them for 3 days now. Wipe stuff down. Throw in laundry. Repeat. My surfaces are still clean. The world didn’t end. And guess what? My trash can isn’t stuffed full of sad, soggy towel ghosts.

Also? No more of that “oh no we’re out of paper towels, guess we can’t clean” excuse. Now it’s just me, my rags, and accountability.

1lo384b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/1lo384b/excerpt_from_descent_an_anbu_kakashi_arc/,"Excerpt from Descent, an Anbu Kakashi arc character study. Would love feedback","As he stopped himself from absentmindedly scratching his ears beneath his hood for what may well have been the dozenth time in an hour, Kakashi complained to himself, once again, how much distaste he sometimes felt for formality. 

The Winter Chunin exams were well underway. Suna had elected to host this edition of the biannual event - partly in honor of their continuing alliance with Konoha, and partly because large swaths of the Land of Fire were currently blanketed beneath a thick cover of ice and snow. Here in the deserted regions far to the southwest, however, a slight chill to the dry air was their worst seasonal ailment.

High in a private section of the arena stands, he stood with Itachi behind the Hokage's designated seat, while Tenzo and Mizu were dispersed somewhere amongst the packed arena stands beyond them to observe the crowd. Team Ro and Team Ke had been called upon to accompany the Sandaime and stand at the ready throughout the week-long event, operating in opposite shifts.

The formality of the exams required both Anbu teams to represent both themselves and Konoha in the public eye. Consequently, they were all fully covered and masked, and Kakashi and Panther both wore their white cloaks to identify themselves as Captains. The material of Kakashi's cloak was still bright and pristine, as he went to great lengths to avoid situations that forced him to wear it. For the same reason, it was also terribly stiff and itchy. 

As surreptitiously as he could, Kakashi craned his neck slightly as he tried to rub his ear against the inner fabric of his hood to alleviate his discomfort. It didn't work.

The battle being fought far below their feet was coming up on its fifteenth minute. Having already expended most of their chakra in earlier techniques, the two genin had closed quarters and resorted to a contest of taijutsu, throwing messier and messier kicks and punches as they exhausted each other. While the execution left something to be desired, Kakashi had to commend their stamina.

“This has become a war of attrition,” Itachi said quietly as he stood in perfect posture beside him.

“Pretty much,” Kakashi murmured.

“A necessary evil.” Kakashi turned his head slightly to glance down at him questioningly. Itachi continued. “It's better to fight a surrogate war in an arena and expose the new generation to a contained conflict than to create a real one. I think that's what Nidaime-sama intended when he first introduced the practice.”

A corner of Kakashi’s mouth curled upwards slightly as he returned his attention to the two young shinobi below - both probably as old, if not older, than the boy next to him. It shouldn't anymore, but it often surprised him how mature Itachi was. He rarely spoke, but when he did, every word sounded as if it came from someone much older than the eleven year old beside him. 

He opened his mouth to reply, but decided against it as the crowd roared. One of the genin, a small, wiry girl from Suna, had landed a solid uppercut that had thrown her opponent backwards. He stumbled, his Konoha forehead protector falling down his face to lay loosely around his neck, before falling flat onto his back and lying still. The proctor walked to the center of the arena and called the match in the girl's favor as the stands cheered with renewed intensity. 

Having now witnessed the end of the last scheduled match of the day, the spectators in the stands began to shuffle as the proctor called out the scheduled matches for the following morning and made announcements. Kakashi and Itachi moved to kneel before the Sandaime as he stood from his chair. Mizu and Tenzo appeared behind them several seconds later, kneeling as well. 

With the full guard assembled, they escorted the Sandaime to their quarters within the Kazekage tower. Upon their arrival, Team Ro traded their watch with Mongoose, Bear, Fox, and Panther - the latter of which showing none of the flamboyance Kakashi had expected from their last encounter. Once the white cloak came out, Kakashi mused to himself as he watched Team Ke leave to escort the Hokage to his rooms, he was an entirely different man.

____________________________________________________________________________

Team Ke was to cover the entirety of the night shift, as the two teams had already decided to swap their positions at twelve hour intervals. However, after a quick meal (and an incredibly gratifying ear scratching), Team Ro stayed in their temporary quarters in the Kazekage tower, standing by on the off chance that they were called upon. 

It was there that they now found themselves. The tower had several large suites that contained bedrooms attached to a larger lounging area, furnished with a fireplace, kitchenette and soft couches that were generally reserved for traveling diplomatic envoys. They’d been pleased on their arrival to find that both teams had been offered their own. 

Itachi had retired to his own room early after some polite conversation, preferring his own company. Tenzo busied himself at the kitchenette, rummaging through the cabinets and looking for tea, as Mizu fell into an armchair across the room with a scroll open on her lap. Glad that he hadn’t made the decision to leave it behind, Kakashi picked a sofa near the fire and promptly melted into it with his book in hand, soaking in the warmth.

Tenzo huffed behind him. “I could have sworn I saw matcha here earlier, did one of you move it to mess with me?”

“I wouldn’t know anything about it,” Mizu said.

“Is that from what I think it's from?”

Kakashi stole a quick glance over the back of the sofa before returning to the book in his hands. Tenzo now stood a pace behind him pointing accusingly at Mizu’s hands, still held up in a placating gesture from her prior statement. A patterned burn scar covered most of her right palm, bright pink against her light colored skin. She lowered her hands, grinning ruefully.

“It looks worse than it actually was. Rabbit drinks, he reads romance books, and I work on projects I apparently have no chance of figuring out. We all need fun little ways to fill our time.”

“They’re not romance books,” Kakashi drawled softly as he turned a page.

Tenzo leaned over the back of the sofa, reading over his shoulder. “Why is Hikari saying “I love you more than life” to-”

The book snapped shut.

Tenzo pursed his lips, failing to hide a smile as he pushed off the sofa. 

Swiftly deciding his downtime would be better spent relaxing than reading, Kakashi tucked his book against his side and slid down farther on the sofa to get comfortable, closing his eye. Sighing softly to himself, he pointedly ignored the slight heat he felt creeping up his neck as he crossed his arms loosely over his chest.

Sometime after he had settled for a cup of sencha and they’d lapsed into comfortable silence, Tenzo spoke again. “What if you need someone with a Byakuugan?” Mizu glanced over at him as he continued. “Maybe they’d be able to see what you’re doing wrong.” A grin broke across Tenzo's face as another thought occurred to him. “What if you asked Haru to help you out?’

Mizu raised an indignant eyebrow. “Ox? You’re joking, I assume,” she responded somewhat flatly.

“He has nothing better to do right now, he still isn’t cleared for active duty. It’s perfect.” Mizu stared at him before looking down at the hands clasped in her lap, remaining silent.

“Tenzo, that’s a pretty solid idea,” Kakashi mumbled, not bothering to open his eye to look at him.

“Isn't it?”

“The matcha can’s behind the stack of firewood in the corner.”

There was a pause before Tenzo sighed. “Thanks, Senpai.”

____________________________________________________________________________

The following morning, they rose early and got ready for their shift in silence. Kakashi ate, dressed, stretched, and otherwise did anything else he could think of to put off pulling on the last piece of his uniform before they left to meet Team Ke. 

He sat on a sofa in the lounge area, pulling on his sandals and eyeing the white fabric hung by the door as if it would try to bite him, when Itachi came out of his room. He moved to the Captain’s cloak on the wall and tucked a long piece of fabric into the pocket before sitting on an armchair to put on his own shoes. “To tie over your ears,” he said in response to Kakashi's questioning raise of a palm.

“Oh.”

 Itachi stood, tapping his toes against the ground to shift his feet further into his sandals, and looked at him with a small, rare smile. “So you don't fidget.”

“...Thanks.”
____________________________________________________________________________

Of all of the duties that were expected of him, Kakashi thought to himself dejectedly as he turned a page, paperwork had to be among the most vile.

Draped unceremoniously across a couch in the Anbu lounge, he sighed. The day had been long, his body hurt, and his half-written report and team assignment sheets lay before him on the coffee table in utter disdain. They’d returned to the village well after the sun had set; the streets beyond the thick stone walls were dark and had long since been emptied of their occupants. Other than Team Ha, who had just returned from a practice operation and were debriefing in the locker room, he thought he must be among the last people remaining in the building.

He signed his name at the bottom of his now finished report before tossing it on the table before him. Taking a preparatory breath, he moved on to his pile of assignments, checking boxes and writing adjustments with the unerring determination of a man that wanted to go the hell home. He paused as he reached one of the last pages in the pile, detailing the rotation of the Uchiha compound surveillance watch across all teams.

Maybe it was time. 

Itachi was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, mature and capable. He had undertaken his missions without flinching, took orders without hesitation, and had killed without blinking an eye at the prospect of bloodying his own hands for the sake of his village. He had never failed a task that Kakashi had put before him, nor had he ever given any indication that he would balk at any single thing asked of him, no matter how large or small.

It followed, then, that Itachi understood that the tasks that would be required of him were considered to be in the best interests of the village as a whole. As Tenzo had reminded him some months ago, he was now considered a fully fledged member of Team Ro. With that position came an expectation that he would assist in any and all dirty work that kept Konoha safe. Itachi could handle that; he was expected to. The boy, while young, had an unerring sense of duty about him that Kakashi had grown to admire. 

He wrote Weasel in a blank line on the sheet, next to Hawk, before clicking his pen closed and setting it down. As he went to sit the page down on the table, he hesitated.

It was easy to get lost in the monotony of surveillance tasks; the repetitive nature of watching people go about their day-to-day life was, by definition, frequently boring. But the fact remained that thinking too hard about the idea that Kakashi was spying on a Konoha clan, people that were his brothers and sisters in arms, made him nauseous. 

For Itachi, it wouldn’t just be family in arms; it would simply be family. He’d be tasked with watching and reporting on people that he grew up with, that he trusted, that surely must trust him in return. Itachi didn’t know how much the upper echelon had grown to distrust the Uchiha clan as a whole. It seemed unreasonably cruel to save him from that lack of awareness.

Actually, Kakashi corrected himself, there was no way that he wasn’t aware; after all, he was incredibly intelligent. Moreover, he was Fugaku's son, and consequently was probably immersed in the movements and politics of his clan, and so would understand how those clan politics intermingled with the rest of the village. None of this should come as a surprise to anyone with that level of knowledge that had been paying attention to the shifts of the world around them - least of all Itachi.

And yet… 

He sat, scratching his ear absentmindedly, for a long moment as he stared at the sheet. 

He picked up the pen, crossed out Itachi's codename and replaced it with his own.",1,1751276150.0,NarutoFanfiction,0,1.0,False

1lo32ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lo32ck/nightmares_and_dreamscapes_by_stephen_king/,Nightmares and Dreamscapes by Stephen King,"When I was a kid I believed everything I was told, everything I read, and every dispatch sent out by my own overheated imagination. This made for more than a few sleepless nights, but it also filled the world I lived in with colors and textures I would not have traded for a lifetime of restful nights. I knew even then, you see, that there were people in the world--too many of them, actually--whose imaginative senses were either numb or completely deadened, and who lived in a mental state akin to color-blindness. I always felt sorry for them, never dreaming (at least then) that many of these unimaginative types either pitied me or held me in contempt, not just because I suffered from any number of irrational fears but because I was deeply and unreservedly credulous on almost every subject. ""There's a boy,"" some of them must have thought (I know my mother did), ""who will buy the Brooklyn Bridge not just once but over and over again, all his life.""  
  
  There was some truth to that then, I suppose, and if I am to be honest, I suppose there's some truth to it now. My wife still delights in telling people that her husband cast his first Presidential ballot, at the tender age of twenty-one, for Richard Nixon. ""Nixon said he had a plan to get us out of Vietnam,"" she says, usually with a gleeful gleam in her eye, ""and Steve believed him!""  
  
  That's right; Steve believed him. Nor is that all Steve has believed during the often-eccentric course of his forty-five years. I was, for example, the last kid in my neighborhood to decide that all those street-corner Santas meant there was no real Santa (I still find no logical merit in the idea; it's like saying that a million disciples prove there is no master). I never questioned my Uncle Oren's assertion that you could tear off a person's shadow with a steel tent-peg (if you struck precisely at high noon, that was) or his wife's claim that every time you shivered, a goose was walking over the place where your grave would someday be. Given the course of my life, that must mean I'm slated to end up buried behind Aunt Rhody's barn out in Goose Wallow, Wyoming.  
  
  I also believed everything I was told in the schoolyard; little minnows and whale-sized whoppers went down my throat with equal ease. One kid told me with complete certainty that if you put a dime down on a railroad track, the first train to come along would be derailed by it. Another kid told me that a dime left on a railroad track would be perfectly smooshed (that was exactly how he put it--perfectly smooshed) by the next train, and what you took off the rail a  
fter the train had passed would be a flexible and nearly transparent coin the size of a silver dollar. My own belief was that both things were true: that dimes left on railroad tracks were perfectly smooshed before they derailed the trains which did the smooshing.  
  
  Other fascinating schoolyard facts which I absorbed during my years at Center School in Stratford, Connecticut, and Durham Elementary School in Durham, Maine, concerned such diverse subjects as golf-balls (poisonous and corrosive at the center), miscarriages (sometimes born alive, as malformed monsters which had to be killed by health-care individuals ominously referred to as ""the special nurses""), black cats (if one crossed your path, you had to fork the sign of the evil eye at it quickly or risk almost certain death before the end of the day), and sidewalk cracks. I probably don't have to explain the potentially dangerous relationship of these latter to the spinal columns of completely innocent mothers.  
  
  My primary sources of wonderful and amazing facts in those days were the paperback compilations from Ripley's Believe It or Not! which were issued by Pocket Books. It was in Ripley's that I discovered you could make a powerful explosive by scraping the celluloid off the backs of playing cards and then tamping the stuff into a length of pipe, that you could drill a hole in your own skull and then plug it with a candle, thereby turning yourself into a kind of human night-light (why anyone would want to do such a thing was a question which never occurred to me until years later), that there were actual giants (one man well over eight feet tall), actual elves (one woman barely eleven inches tall), and actual MONSTERS TOO HORRIBLE TO DESCRIBE . . . except Ripley's described them all, in loving detail, and usually with a picture (if I live to be a hundred, I'll never forget the one of the guy with the candle stuck in the center of his shaved skull).  
  
  That series of paperbacks was--to me, at least--the world's most wonderful sideshow, one I could carry around in my back pocket and curl up with on rainy weekend afternoons, when there were no baseball games and everyone was tired of Monopoly. Were all of Ripley's fabulous curiosities and human monsters real? In this context that hardly seems relevant. They were real to me, and that probably is--during the years from six to eleven, crucial years in which the human imagination is largely formed, they were very real to me. I believed them just as I believed you could derail a freight-train with a dime or that the drippy goop in the center of a golf-ball would eat the hand right off your arm if you were careless and got some of it on you. It was in Ripley's Believe It or Not! that I first began to see how fine the line between the fabulous and the humdrum could sometimes be, and to understand that the juxtaposition of the two did as much to illuminate the ordinary aspects of life as it did to illuminate its occasional weird outbreaks. Remember it's belief we're talking about here, and belief is the cradle of myth. What about reality, you ask? Well, as far as I'm concerned, reality can go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. I've never held much of a brief for reality, at least in my written work. All too often it is to the imagination what ash stakes are to vampires.  
  
  I think that myth and imagination are, in fact, nearly interchangeable concepts, and that belief is the wellspring of both. Belief in what? I don't think it matters very much, to tell you the truth. One god or many. Or that a dime can derail a freight-train.  
  
  These beliefs of mine had nothing to do with faith; let's be very clear on that subject. I was raised Methodist and hold onto enough of the fundamentalist teachings of my childhood to believe that such a claim would be presumptuous at best and downright blasphemous at worst. I believed all that weird stuff because I was built to believe in weird stuff. Other people run races because they were built to run fast, or play basketball because God made them six-foot-ten, or solve long, complicated equations on blackboards because they were built to see the places where the numbers all lock together.  
  
  Yet faith comes into it someplace, and I think that place has to do with going back to do the same thing again and again even though you believe in your deepest, truest heart that you will never be able to do it any better than you already have, and that if you press on, there's really no place to go but downhill. You don't have anything to lose when you take your first whack at the pinata, but to take a second one (and a third. . . and a fourth. . . and a thirty-fourth) is to risk failure, depression, and, in the case of the short-story writer who works in a pretty well defined genre, self-parody. But we do go on, most of us, and that gets to be hard. I never would have believed that twenty years ago, or even ten, but it does. It gets hard. And I have days when I think this old Wang word-processor stopped running on electricity about five years ago; that from The Dark Half on, it's been running completely on faith. But that's okay; whatever gets the words across the screen, right?  
  
  The idea for each of the stories in this book came in a moment of belief and was written in a burst of faith, happiness, and optimism. Those positive feelings have their dark analogues, however, and the fear of failure is a long way from the worst of them. The worst--for me, at least--is the gnawing speculation that I may have already said everything I have to say, and am now only listening to the steady quacking of my own voice because the silence when it stops is just too spooky.  
  
  The leap of faith necessary to make the short stories happen has gotten particularly tough in the last few years; these days it seems that everything wants to be a novel, and every novel wants to be approximately four thousand pages long. A fair number of critics have mentioned this, and usually not favorably. In reviews of every long novel I have written, from The Stand to Needful Things, I have been accused of overwriting. In some cases the criticisms have merit; in others they are just the ill-tempered yappings of men and women who have accepted the literary anorexia of the last thirty years with a puzzling (to me, at least) lack of discussion and dissent. These self-appointed deacons in the Church of Latter-Day American Literature seem to regard generosity with suspicion, texture with dislike, and any broad literary stroke with outright hate. The result is a strange and arid literary climate where a meaningless little fingernail-paring like Nicholson Baker's Vox becomes an object of fascinated debate and dissection, and a truly ambitious American novel like Greg Matthews's Heart of the Country is all but ignored.  
  
  But all that is by the by, not only off the subject but just a tiny bit whimpery, too--after all, was there ever a writer who didn't feel that he or she had been badly treated by the critics? All I started to say before I so rudely interrupted myself was that the act of faith which turns a moment of belief into a real object--i.e., a short story that people will actually want to read--has been a little harder for me to come by in the last few years.  
  
  ""Well then, don't write them,"" someone might say (only it's usually a voice I hear inside my own head, like the ones Jessie Burlingame hears in Gerald's Game). ""After all, you don't need the money they bring in the way you once did.""  
  
  That's true enough. The days when a check for some four-thousand-word wonder would buy penicillin for one of the kids' ear infections or help meet the rent are long gone. But the logic is more than spurious; it's dangerous. I don't exactly need the money the novels bring in, either, you see. If it was just the money, I could hang up my jock and hit the showers. . . or spend the rest of my life on some Caribbean island, catching the rays and seeing how long I could grow my fingernails.  
  
  But it isn't about the money, no matter what the glossy tabloids may say, and it's not about selling out, as the more arrogant critics really seem to believe. The fundamental things still apply as time goes by, and for me the object hasn't changed--the job is still getting to you, Constant Reader, getting you by the short hairs and, hopefully, scaring you so badly you won't be able to go to sleep without leaving the bathroom light on. It's still about first seeing the impossible . . . and then saying it. It's still about making you believe what I believe, at least for a little while.  
  
  I don't talk about this much, because it embarrasses me and it sounds pompous, but I still see stories as a great thing, something which not only enhances lives but actually s  
aves them. Nor am I speaking metaphorically. Good writing--good stories--are the imagination's firing pin, and the purpose of the imagination, I believe, is to offer us solace and shelter from situations and life-passages which would otherwise prove unendurable. I can only speak from my own experience, of course, but for me, the imagination which so often kept me awake and in terror as a child has seen me through some terrible bouts of stark raving reality as an adult. If the stories which have resulted from that imagination have done the same for some of the people who've read them, then I am perfectly happy and perfectly satisfied--feelings which cannot, so far as I know, be purchased with rich movie deals or multi-million-dollar book contracts.  
  
  Still, the short story is a difficult and challenging literary form, and that's why I was so delighted--and so surprised--to find I had enough of them to issue a third collection. It has come at a propitious time, as well, because one of those facts of which I was so sure as a kid (I probably picked it up in Ripley's Believe It or Not!, too) was that people completely renew themselves every seven years: every tissue, every organ, every muscle replaced by entirely new cells. I am drawing Nightmares and Dreamscapes together in the summer of 1992, seven years after the publication of Skeleton Crew, my last collection of short stories, and Skeleton Crew was published seven years after Night Shift, my first collection. The greatest thing is knowing that, although the leap of faith necessary to translate an idea into reality has become harder (the jumping muscles get a little older every day, you know), it's still perfectly possible. The next greatest thing is knowing that someone still wants to read them--that's you, Constant Reader, should you wonder.  
  
  The oldest of these stories (my versions of the killer golf-ball goop and monster miscarriages, if you will) is ""It Grows on You,"" originally published in a University of Maine literary magazine called Marshroots . . . although it has been considerably revised for this book, so it could better be what it apparently wanted to be--a final look back at the doomed little town of Castle Rock. The most recent, ""The Ten O'Clock People,"" was written in three fevered days during the summer of 1992.

  I waited and watched for seven years. I saw him come and go--Dolan. I watched him stroll into fancy restaurants dressed in a tuxedo, always with a different woman on his arm, always with his pair of bodyguards bookending him. I watched his hair go from iron-gray to a fashionable silver while my own simply receded until I was bald. I watched him leave Las Vegas on his regular pilgrimages to the West Coast; I watched him return. On two or three occasions I watched from a side road as his Sedan DeVille, the same color as his hair, swept by on Route 71 toward Los Angeles. And on a few occasions I watched him leave his place in the Hollywood Hills in the same gray Cadillac to return to Las Vegas--not often, though. I am a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers and high-priced hoodlums do not have the same freedom of movement; it's just an economic fact of life.  
  
  He did not know I was watching him--I never came close enough for him to know that. I was careful.  
  
  He killed my wife or had her killed; it comes to the same, either way. Do you want details? You won't get them from me. If you want them, look them up in the back issues of the papers. Her name was Elizabeth. She taught in the same school where I taught and where I teach still. She taught first-graders. They loved her, and I think that some of them may not have forgotten their love still, although they would be teenagers now. I loved her and love her still, certainly. She was not beautiful but she was pretty. She was quiet, but she could laugh. I dream of her. Of her hazel eyes. There has never been another woman for me. Nor ever will be.  
  
  He slipped--Dolan. That's all you have to know. And Elizabeth was there, at the wrong place and the wrong time, to see the slip. She went to the police, and the police sent her to the FBI, and she was questioned, and she said yes, she would testify. They promised to protect her, but they either slipped or they underestimated Dolan. Maybe it was both. Whatever it was, she got into her car one night and the dynamite wired to the ignition made me a widower. He made me a widower--Dolan.  
  
  With no witness to testify, he was let free.  
  
  He went back to his world, I to mine. The penthouse apartment in Vegas for him, the empty tract home for me. The succession of beautiful women in furs and sequined evening dresses for him, the silence for me. The gray Cadillacs, four of them over the years, for him, and the aging Buick Riviera for me. His hair went silver while mine just went.  
  
  But I watched.  
  
  I was careful--oh, yes! Very careful. I knew what he was, what he could do. I knew he would step on me like a bug if he saw or sensed what I meant for him. So I was careful.  
  
  During my summer vacation three years ago I followed him (at a prudent distance) to Los Angeles, where he went frequently. He stayed in his fine house and threw parties (I watched the comings and goings from a safe shadow at the end of the block, fading back when the police cars made their frequent patrols), and I stayed in a cheap hotel where people played their radios too loud and neon light from the topless bar across the street shone in the window. I fell asleep on those nights and dreamed of Elizabeth's hazel eyes, dreamed that none of it had ever happened, and woke up sometimes with tears drying on my face.  
  
  I came close to losing hope.  
  
  He was well guarded, you see; so well guarded. He went nowhere without those two heavily armed gorillas with him, and the Cadillac itself was armor plated. The big radial tires it rolled on were of the self-sealing type favored by dictators in small, uneasy countries.  
  
  Then, that last time, I saw how it could be done--but I did not see it until after I'd had a very bad scare.  
  
  I followed him back to Las Vegas, always keeping at least a mile between us, sometimes two, sometimes three. As we crossed the desert heading east his car was at times no more than a sunflash on the horizon and I thought about Elizabeth, how the sun looked on her hair.  
  
  I was far behind on this occasion. It was the middle of the week, and traffic on U.S. 71 was very light. When traffic is light, tailing becomes dangerous--even a grammar-school teacher knows that. I passed an orange sign which read DETOUR 5 MILES and dropped back even farther. Desert detours slow traffic to a crawl, and I didn't want to chance coming up behind the gray Cadillac as the driver babied it over some rutted secondary road.  
  
  DETOUR 3 MILES, the next sign read, and below that: BLASTING AREA AHEAD \* TURN OFF 2-WAY RADIO.  
  
  I began to muse on some movie I had seen years before. In this film a band of armed robbers had tricked an armored car into the desert by putting up false detour signs. Once the driver fell for the trick and turned off onto a deserted dirt road (there are thousands of them in the desert, sheep roads and ranch roads and old government roads that go nowhere), the thieves had removed the signs, assuring isolation, and then had simply laid siege to the armored car until the guards came out.  
r />   They killed the guards.  
  
  I remembered that.  
  
  They killed the guards.  
  
  I reached the detour and turned onto it. The road was as bad as I had imagined--packed dirt, two lanes wide, filled with potholes that made my old Buick jounce and groan. The Buick needed new shock absorbers, but shocks are an expense a schoolteacher sometimes has to put off, even when he is a widower with no children and no hobbies except his dream of revenge.  
  
  As the Buick bounced and wallowed along, an idea occurred to me. Instead of following Dolan's Cadillac the next time it left Vegas for L.A. or L.A. for Vegas, I would pass it--get ahead of it. I would create a false detour like the one in the movie, luring it out into the wastes that exist, silent and rimmed by mountains, west of Las Vegas. Then I would remove the signs, as the thieves had done in the movie--  
  
  I snapped back to reality suddenly. Dolan's Cadillac was ahead of me, directly ahead of me, pulled off to one side of the dusty track. One of the tires, self-sealing or not, was flat. No--not just flat. It was exploded, half off the rim. The culprit had probably been a sharp wedge of rock stuck in the hardpan like a miniature tank-trap. One of the two bodyguards was working a jack under the front end. The second--an ogre with a pig-face streaming sweat under his brush cut--stood protectively beside Dolan himself. Even in the desert, you see, they took no chances.  
  
  Dolan stood to one side, slim in an open-throated shirt and dark slacks, his silver hair blowing around his head in the desert breeze. He was smoking a cigarette and watching the men as if he were somewhere else, a restaurant or a ballroom or a drawing room perhaps.  
  
  His eyes met mine through the windshield of my car and then slid off with no recognition at all, although he had seen me once, seven years ago (when I had hair!), at a preliminary hearing, sitting beside my wife.  
  
  My terror at having caught up with the Cadillac was replaced with an utter fury.  
  
  I thought of leaning over and unrolling the passenger window and shrieking: How dare you forget me? How dare you dismiss me? Oh, but that would have been the act of a lunatic. It was good that he had forgotten me, it was fine that he had dismissed me. Better to be a mouse behind the wainscoting, nibbling at the wires. Better to be a spider, high up under the eaves, spinning its web.  
  
  The man sweating the jack flagged me, but Dolan wasn't the only one capable of dismissal. I looked indifferently beyond the arm-waver, wishing him a heart attack or a stroke or, best of all, both at the same time. I drove on--but my head pulsed and throbbed, and for a few moments the mountains on the horizon seemed to double and even treble.  
  
  If I'd had a gun! I thought. If only I'd had a gun! I could have ended his rotten, miserable life right then if I'd only had a gun!  
  
  Miles later some sort of reason reasserted itself. If I'd had a gun, the only thing I could have been sure of was getting myself killed. If I'd had a gun I could have pulled over when the man using the bumper-jack beckoned me, and gotten out, and begun spraying bullets wildly around the deserted landscape. I might have wounded someone. Then I would have been killed and buried in a shallow grave, and Dolan would have gone on escorting the beautiful women and making pilgrimages between Las Vegas and Los Angeles in his silver Cadillac while the desert animals unearthed my remains and fought over my bones under the cold moon. For Elizabeth there would have been no revenge--none at all.  
  
  The men who travelled with him were trained to kill. I was trained to teach third-graders.  
  
  This was not a movie, I reminded myself as I returned to the highway and passed an orange END CONSTRUCTION \* THE STATE OF NEVADA THANKS YOU! sign. And if I ever made the mistake of confusing reality with a movie, of thinking that a balding third-grade teacher with myopia could ever be Dirty Harry anywhere outside of his own daydreams, there would never be any revenge, ever.  
  
  But could there be revenge, ever? Could there be?  
  
  My idea of creating a fake detour was as romantic and unrealistic as the idea of jumping out of my old Buick and spraying the three of them with bullets--me, who had not fired a gun since the age of sixteen and who had never fired a handgun.  
  
  Such a thing would not be possible without a band of conspirators--even the movie I had seen, romantic as it had been, had made that clear. There had been eight or nine of them in two separate groups, staying in touch with each other by walkie-talkie. There had even been a man in a small plane cruising above the highway to make sure the armored car was relatively isolated as it approached the right spot on the highway.  
  
  A plot no doubt dreamed up by some overweight screenwriter sitting by his swimming pool with a pina colada by one hand and a fresh supply of Pentel pens and an Edgar Wallace plot-wheel by the other. And even that fellow had needed a small army to fulfill his idea. I was only one man.  
  
  It wouldn't work. It was just a momentary false gleam, like the others I'd had over the years--the idea that maybe I could put some sort of poison gas in Dolan's air-conditioning system, or plant a bomb in his Los Angeles house, or perhaps obtain some really deadly weapon--a bazooka, let us say--and turn his damned silver Cadillac into a fireball as it raced east toward Vegas or west toward L.A. along 71.  
  
  Best to dismiss it.  
  
  But it wouldn't go.  
  
  Cut him out, the voice inside that spoke for Elizabeth kept whispering. Cut him out the way an experienced sheep-dog cuts a ewe out of the flock when his master points. Detour him out into the emptiness and kill him. Kill them all.  
  
  Wouldn't work. If I allowed no other truth, I would at least have to allow that a man who had stayed alive as long as Dolan must have a carefully honed sense of survival--honed to the point of paranoia, perhaps. He and his men would see through the detour trick in a minute.  
  
  They turned down this one today, the voice that spoke for Elizabeth responded. They never even hesitated. They went just like Mary's little lamb.  
  
  But I knew--yes, somehow I did!--that men like Dolan, men who are really more like wolves than men, develop a sort of sixth sense when it comes to danger. I could steal genuine detour signs from some road department shed and set them up in all the right places; I could even add fluorescent orange road cones and a few of those smudge-pots. I could do all that and Dolan would still smell the nervous sweat of my hands on the stage dressing. Right through his bullet-proof windows he would smell it. He would close his eyes and hear Elizabeth's name far back in the snake-pit that passed for his mind.  
  
  The voice that spoke for Elizabeth fell silent, and I thought it had finally given up for the day. And then, with Vegas actually in sight--blue and misty and wavering on the far rim of the desert--it spoke up again.  
  
  Then don't try to fool him with a fake detour, it whispered. Fool him with a real one.  
  
  I swerved the Buick over to the shoulder and shuddered to a stop with both feet on the brake-pedal. I stared into my own wide, startled eyes in the rear-view mirror.  
  
  Inside, the voice that spoke for Elizabeth began to laugh. It was wild, mad laughter, but after a few moments I began to laugh along with it.  
  
  \*  
  
  The other teachers laughed at me when I joined the Ninth Street Health Club. One of them wanted to know if someone had kicked sand in my face. I laughed along with them. People don't get suspicious of a man like me as long as he keeps laughing along with them. And why shouldn't I laugh? My wife had been dead seven years, hadn't she? Why, she was no more than dust and hair and a few bones in her coffin! So why shouldn't I laugh? It's only when a man like me stops laughing that people wonder if something is wrong.  
  
  I laughed along with them even though my muscles ached all that fall and winter. I laughed even though I was constantly hungry--no more second helpings, no more late-night snacks, no more beer, no more before-dinner gin and tonic. But lots of red meat and greens, greens, greens.  
  
  I bought myself a Nautilus machine for Christmas.  
  
  No--that's not quite right. Elizabeth bought me a Nautilus machine for Christmas.  
  
  I saw Dolan less frequently; I was too busy working out, losing my pot belly, bu  
ilding up my arms and chest and legs. But there were times when it seemed I could not go on with it, that recapturing anything like real physical fitness was going to be impossible, that I could not live without second helpings and pieces of coffee cake and the occasional dollop of sweet cream in my coffee. When those times came I would park across from one of his favorite restaurants or perhaps go into one of the clubs he favored and wait for him to show up, stepping from the fog-gray Cadillac with an arrogant, icy blonde or a laughing redhead on his arm--or one on each. There he would be, the man who had killed my Elizabeth, there he would be, resplendent in a formal shirt from Bijan's, his gold Rolex winking in the nightclub lights. When I was tired and discouraged I went to Dolan as a man with a raging thirst might seek out an oasis in the desert. I drank his poisoned water and was refreshed.  
  
  In February I began to run every day, and then the other teachers laughed at my bald head, which peeled and pinked and then peeled and pinked again, no matter how much sunblock I smeared on it. I laughed right along with them, as if I had not twice nearly fainted and spent long, shuddering minutes with cramps stabbing the muscles of my legs at the end of my runs.  
  
  When summer came, I applied for a job with the Nevada Highway Department. The municipal employment office stamped a tentative approval on my form and sent me along to a district foreman named Harvey Blocker. Blocker was a tall man, burned almost black by the Nevada sun. He wore jeans, dusty workboots, and a blue tee-shirt with cut-off sleeves. BAD ATTITUDE, the shirt proclaimed. His muscles were big rolling slabs under his skin. He looked at my application. Then he looked at me and laughed. The application looked very puny rolled up in one of his huge fists.  
  
  ""You got to be kidding, my friend. I mean, you have got to be. We talkin desert sun and desert heat here--none of that yuppie tanning-salon shit. What are you in real life, bubba? An accountant?""  
  
  ""A teacher,"" I said. ""Third grade.""  
  
  ""Oh, honey,"" he said, and laughed again. ""Get out of my face, okay?""  
  
  I had a pocket watch--handed down from my great-grandfather, who worked on the last stretch of the great transcontinental railroad. He was there, according to family legend, when they hammered home the golden spike. I took the watch out and dangled it in Blocker's face on its chain.

🧬 Why Do Plateaus Happen on GLP-1s?

1️⃣ Metabolic Adaptation

As you lose weight, your basal metabolic rate (BMR) decreases because a smaller body requires fewer calories to maintain itself.

Your body is wired for survival, not fat loss, and will adjust hormones and metabolism to preserve energy during a calorie deficit.

2️⃣ Reduced Total Energy Expenditure

Even if you eat and move exactly the same, your total calorie burn decreases after weight loss due to: ✅ Lower BMR ✅ Less energy needed to move a lighter body ✅ Potential decreases in Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) (e.g., unconscious fidgeting, moving around less)

3️⃣ Water Retention

Hormonal fluctuations, stress, inflammation (from exercise or illness), and increased sodium can cause temporary water retention that masks fat loss.

Many “plateaus” are actually weight stabilisations with ongoing fat loss hidden by water fluctuations.

4️⃣ Caloric Intake Creep

Over time, as appetite returns slightly or portion sizes creep up, calorie intake may increase.

GLP-1s help reduce hunger, but they don’t fully override habits or emotional eating, which can stall progress.

⚡️ What’s Normal?

✨ Plateaus are normal and can last anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months.  
✨ They do not mean the medication isn’t working.  
✨ They are not a personal failure.

Your body needs time to adjust to each new weight before it feels “safe” to continue losing.

✅ Strategies to Navigate Plateaus

Here’s what you can try, gently and sustainably:

🥗 1. Review Intake

Log your intake for a few days to check portion sizes and snacking.

Ensure you’re getting adequate protein (0.8–1g per lb of goal body weight if medically appropriate) to preserve muscle mass.

Check for liquid calories (coffee add-ins, alcohol, juices) that can add up unnoticed.

🚶‍♀️ 2. Increase NEAT

Add small movements throughout your day:

NEAT can account for hundreds of additional calories burned per day without feeling like “exercise.”

🏋️ 3. Strength Training

Building or preserving muscle helps your metabolism stay higher.

Even bodyweight squats, resistance bands, or light weights at home can help.

🌊 4. Hydration & Sodium Awareness

Staying hydrated helps reduce water retention.

If your intake of salty foods increased, reducing sodium can help with water balance.

🧘 5. Patience & Perspective

Plateaus are part of long-term weight management.

Sometimes your body is recalibrating hormonally or repairing lean tissue.

Progress photos, measurements, or how your clothes fit can show changes even if the scale doesn’t.

💬 Let’s Discuss:

✨ Have you hit a plateau on your GLP-1 journey?  
✨ How long did it last for you?  
✨ What helped you push through, or what are you trying now?

Your stories can help others feel less alone and give practical ideas to those currently in a plateau.

🚀 Final Thoughts:

Weight loss isn’t a straight line, and plateaus do not mean you’re failing or that the medication has stopped working. They are a normal, expected phase of your journey.",1,1751275433.0,WeightLossMedsUK,0,1.0,False

Totally had my gut blasted because it was 2x prescriptions within 1 month, trying to reduce any future backlashes.

had a nasty infection, covid, and food poisoning all over a span of 2 months, doc reccommend 
7x days ammox, +flonaise

7x days steroid (clear out leftover sinus fluid/gunk)

7x ammox +flonaise

did the rounds about 3+ months ago and am eating mostly normally now, but I have to work around a touchy stomach that becomes slightly more acidic with acne medicine (some benz-something cream 1/5%, can't remember)

and the fact that I have temporary GERD/LPR. 

What's suggested as a way forwards from here?


Steps taken so far:
-used mild cheddar + applesauce + toast + ginger ale to balance out gut, now down to cheddar, boiled egg, and applesauce + normal foods. I eat applesauce before something really greasy, rarely if ever touch pepto at all now.

-eating relatively healthy, cut out 90% of soda, sip at most 2 ounces unless really tired when I do drink. 

-main drink is water (thankfully always sorta has been, I'm just drinking a higher ratio of it to other drinks now), sometimes mixed with propel or alternating with the occasional centrum men's multivitamin.

-had to eat smaller meals spread out, just couldn't stomach a full meal for 1st 2 months. now I can...sorta, if the main cause of LPR doesn't act up.

multivitamin...frankly I had to stop it because I was getting wierd symptoms (head pressure, nausea, dizziness), so I tried to focus on a wide variety of foods instead (mostly accomplished).

bad habits from before:

-sneaking suspicion that the benza...something antibiotic paste made my gut more acidic over time. thanks to new diet, this has mostly calmed down, but still actually up with too little sleep.

-soda...would drink it like coffee in the morning. Not too much, but was a daily drinker for past 8 years. (couldn't quite get myself to get addicted to espresso in college, coffee felt too strong.)

-stopped eating any biotic because a yogurt would send me to a bathroom within 15 minutes flat. Have since found my 'sweet spot' is about half a Yoplait (or other brand) yogurt, but generally varies from brand to brand. ",1,1751275247.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False
1lo302g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lo302g/my_current_full_routine_in_details/,My current full routine - in details!,"Hi everyone,

I spent years exploring supplements, training and various stuff, and I think i finally found something that works well for me - energy and health wise, so I thought it might be interesting to share.

**1) The diet -** the idea is to be metabolically healthy, as well feed the gut microbiome with a diversity of stuff.

My diet is quite simple. Breakfast is composed of oats, whey isolat, EVOO, green tea, and cocoa with high polyphenols. I'll often add a bowl of frozen red fruits.

Lunch is a bit bland: steamed sweet potato with EVOO, crushed gralic, some spices and lemon juices. I then cook either fish, 5% fat ground beef or chicken breast.

Evening will consist of a protein (mostly low fat meat), a salad that includes raw white onions, some beans, a slice of high fiber bread, and I usually finish with a bowl of skyr and some honey.

I'll do a cheat meal 2 times a week, that I optimize usually by doing stuff like removing the fries when i'm eating burgers or stuff like that.

**2) The training**

I believe that training should go in all directions, so I try to integrate a bit of everything, in 10 days sessions, with:  
\- 5 sessions of weighlifting, with a mix of strength / close to 1RM, high reps / low rest, plyometrics. I do a mix of compound exercise (bench/squat/DL), bodyweight exercises, mixed with some more ""practical"" exercise like carrying heavy stuff, farmer walk, medecine ball throw, etc. 

\- 3 sessions of cardio: I do either zone 2 if i'm too tired, or thai boxing on the bag with a lot of intervals, which allows me to maintain my flexibility, explosiveness, and work on coordination, which are key. I add some hill sprints from time to time.

\- Stretching: every day of training means at least 5 min of stretching a bit later, more if you feel pain or discomfort.

**3) The supplements - full protocol**  
  
\- A complete multivitamin that integrates Vit D+K2, zinc, selenium  
\- Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Astaxanthin  
\- Lycopene  
\- Longevity Mix - L-Theanine, Taurine, CaAKG, Creatine Monohydrate, Glycine,  reduced Glutathione, Hyaluronic Acid, Magnesium; I used to take those separately but when for it because it was more practical. Both work as well from my POV.  
\- Fish oil with low TOTOX score  
\- 3g of aged garlic extract  
\- 2-3g of ginger powder  
\- 10g of collagen peptides  
\- Prebiotics: 3g of *Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)* \+ 3g of 2’-fucosyllactose, a prebiotic derived from human milk with a lot of interesting effects on metabolism & cognition  
\- 10g of psyllium husk, taken away from supplements, for gut/lipids  
\- Cialis: 5mg twice a week (cool gym pump, boner, longevity effects, estrogen management)  
\- Matcha green tea + high polyphenols cocoa (included in diet)  
\- Unlimited coffee until noon, no more after

When I feel a bit tired/ out fit, i'll throw in some adaptogens like ginseng + rodhiola for a few days; I cycle them super quickly and don't take them more than 5 days. I use high doses for the ginseng. It works very well when you need a quick boost.

**4) Other stuff**

\- I do cold bath / cold shower, with a simple rule: no more than twice a week, and do it when my mind thinks it the worst time to (except when sick of course). Meaning - when i feel bad/tired/stressed/in pain, that's when i'll force myself to do a cold shower, to reset stuff psychologically, and lower inflammation. Usually 3-5 min under it.

\- I do PRP **Platelet-rich plasma therapy**, for a few years, to heal training injuries, improve my skin and overall prevent any wear and tear. I do a 1-2 session every 4 to 6 month.

\- Skin care is pretty basic, moisturizer in morning and evening. 

  
**What's next ?**

Supplement wise, I don't see anything worth adding, i'm of course open to suggestions. Diet wise I would like to eat more fish but harder to manage than meat. 

Other biohacking stuff i'm planning to add would be Red Light therapy, HBOT, Sauna. ",5,1751275235.0,Biohackers,3,1.0,False

1lo2tx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lo2tx4/need_advice_about_friendship/,Need advice about friendship,"Hello everyone. This is going to be a long post unfortunately. 
Context: I am 36M and my best friend is 22F. For the past 10 years I have been an introvert because my job was my passion. I was making money playing games and was playing games in my free time also. Before that I was the most social person, had girlfriends, ton of friends, safe to say that I never had a balance in life, I either was never being home or was never leaving my home. Fast forward 8 years, I joined a discord group and made online friends,we used to hang like 10 hours a day and because of that I started missing real life interactions and therefore started hating games. Stopped feeling joy, was unhappy with them. Depression started to kick in, the type of depression I wish no one. One minute I had hope, next minute I was happy them next minute reality kicked in and was sad again. It was a continuous loop which almost destroyed. 
Then, 9 months ago, started connecting with this girl. From the start, none of us wanted a relationship or anything romantic. It was perfect. She is very open in talking, never took too long to respond and was genuinely trying to know me. We started talking privately on voice between 2-10 hours a day. I had hope again because my biggest fear about the change I wanted to make ( leaving the house and make friends to have real activities) was starting to fade away. I thought she was being really mature for her age and that was great. Before becoming an introvert I had lots of female friends. The reason why I value female friends is because they often have different inputs from men which can open a guy's eyes.  I needed a change of scenary and she was it.
At the start of the year, my landlord said she wants to sell the apartment. I said fuck it, this is it, I'm going to move to the town were my online friends were in, including my girl BFF. We started making plans like how we we cook together, play sports, go to the gym, stuff like this.
I found an apartment 10 minutes from her at a good price, everything was perfect. After I moved we started the planned activities, I changed my life, started cooking, going to the gym, keeping my apartment clean, I was so fucking happy again, felt like a normal man for the first time in so long. 
Until 3 days ago... When she said to me that she needs space, that I start to annoy her because we are spending so much time together. Sometimes I talk too loud in public, or laugh too loud (always did that, my past friends found it funny not annoying).
Things which she said annoy her:
- embarrass her in public - we took Uber to the pool and I asked her if she took her heart medicine (she needs to take it daily otherwise she can have big problems). This annoyed her very hard because she felt like the Uber driver didn't have to know her personal problems.
- talk too loud part
- Uber driver also said that there is a guy there who checks at the entrance if we have water and cand check our bodies too. I made a joke that that must be a cool job because. You know, like the gynecologist can see stuff because of his job. She found it too dirty, but in private she would have laughed. 
I am a very empathic, sensitive and affectionate person and I was always trying to be an example of a man for her. Complimenting, being mindful of her problems, buying flowers so she feels like a woman who is cared for, all that stuff. None of this with romantic implications of course, it's just how I am and how I like to treat women.
She is the exact opposite. She is cold, she probably said like 5 nice things to me since we met and I accepted that, didn't feel offended. 
Now back to her wanting more space. She said that she lived with her brother for the most of her life and she knows were this is going. Because we hang out so much we will start hating each other like she did with her brother and fight everyday. Again, we are exact opposite here, I feel that the more I get to know someone even if they have flaws, I don't care about the little annoying habits and the more I want to spend time with them. She on the other hand, the more she spends time with someone, the more annoying it gets. Feels like she can't make even the smallest compromise.
To give even more context, I am a very helpful person and when it seems like she needed help, always provided the solution or advice. She always got annoyed by this because her parents are controlling type. If I tell her when doing something on her laptop ""you should do this, it will fix it"" she gets angry and tell me ""don't tell me what to do"", even though my solution was correct. For her I changed that, started saying ""do you need help? If she said no, would just look at her and watch her waste 20 minutes of her life just so she doesn't get upset. She is obsessed with the independent woman ideology. And I also respected that, change my behavior to support her. 
The real problem is that it feels like I am always stepping on glass with everything I say. To give two examples. First, one day she said she is sleepy because she slept too much. I was genuinely curious and asked ""have you had coffee today?"" (in my mind it was a question, not a solution, not a suggestion). At this she got angry saying to stop offering solutions when she is complaining about something. It was a simple question.... Second example, her eyes started to feel dry. I asked"" do you still have those eye drops"" (not as a solution, but with curiosity)
Again she got mad for the same reason. 
Now with the part where she wants more space. I did everything in my power for this to work, moved to another city, always respected her, did all the compromises I could have made just to be hit with the ""I need space"". I never heard about this for friends and we actually laughed together at couples who said they need that. Feels so heartbreaking. I am not perfect, of course I have flaws, but no matter how well I treat her, she only sees the little annoying things that I do apparently.
How can I handle this? I don't want to lose her as a friend but at the same time I feel exhausted about trying to accommodate my behavior to not upset her. Oh, and as a last thing I asked ""ok so how do we proceed going forward so you don't feel suffocated"" and she said ""just wait for me to invite you for activities"". Not gonna lie, felt like a dog in a doghouse waiting for his master to invite him to play in the yard. What are your guys suggestions? ",1,1751274549.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

ON THOSE CLOUDY DAYS, Robert Neville was never sure when sunset came, and sometimes they were in the streets before he could get back.  
  If he had been more analytical, he might have calculated the approximate time of their arrival; but he still used the lifetime habit of judging nightfall by the sky, and on cloudy days that method didn't work. That was why he chose to stay near the house on those days.  
He walked around the house in the dull gray of afternoon, a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, trailing threadlike smoke over his shoulder. He checked each window to see if any of the boards had been loosened. After violent attacks, the planks were often split or partially pried off, and he had to replace them completely; a job he hated. Today only one plank was loose. Isn't that amazing? he thought.  
 In the back yard he checked the hothouse and the water tank. Sometimes the structure around the tank might be weakened or its rain catchers bent or broken off. Sometimes they would lob rocks over the high fence around the hothouse, and occasionally they would tear through the overhead net and he'd have to replace panes.  
 Both the tank and the hothouse were undamaged today. He went to the house for a hammer and nails. As he pushed open the front door, he looked at the distorted reflection of himself in the cracked mirror he'd fastened to the door a month ago. In a few days, jagged pieces of the silver-backed glass would start to fall off. Let 'em fall, he thought. It was the last damned mirror he'd put there; it wasn't worth it. He'd put garlic there instead. Garlic always worked.  
 He passed slowly through the dim silence of the living room, turned left into the small hallway, and left again into his bedroom.  
Once the room had been warmly decorated, but that was in another time. Now it was a room entirely functional, and since Neville's bed and bureau took up so little space, he had converted one side of the room into a shop.  
A long bench covered almost an entire wall, on its hardwood top a heavy band saw; a wood lathe, an emery wheel, and a vise. Above it, on the wall, were haphazard racks of the tools that Robert N¨¨ville used.  
 He took a hammer from the bench and picked out a few nails from one of the disordered bins. Then he went back outside and nailed the plank fast to the shutter. The unused nails he threw into the rubble next door.  
 For a while he stood on the front lawn looking up and down the silent length of Cimarron Street. He was a tall man, thirty-six, born of English-German stock, his features undistinguished except for the long, determined mouth and the bright blue of his eyes, which moved now over the charred ruins of the houses on each side of his. He'd burned them down to prevent them from jumping on his roof from the adjacent ones.  
 After a few minutes he took a long, slow breath and went back into the house. He tossed the hammer on the living-room couch, then lit another cigarette and had his midmorning drink.  
Later he forced himself into the kitchen to grind up the five-day accumulation of garbage in the sink. He knew he should burn up the paper plates and utensils too, and dust the furniture and wash out the sinks and the bathtub and toilet, and change the sheets and pillowcase on his bed; but he didn't feel like it.  
  
  For he was a man and he was alone and these things had no importance to him.  
  
  It was almost noon. Robert Neville was in his hothouse collecting a basketful of garlic.  
  
  In the beginning it had made him sick to smell garlic in such quantity his stomach had been in a state of constant turmoil. Now the smell was in his house and in his clothes, and sometimes he thought it was even in his flesh.  
  
  He hardly noticed it at all.  
  
  When he had enough bulbs, he went back to the house and dumped them on the drainboard of the sink. As he flicked the wall switch, the light flickered, then flared into normal brilliance. A disgusted hiss passed his clenched teeth. The generator was at it again. He'd have to get out that damned manual again and check the wiring. And, if it were too much trouble to repair, he'd have to install a new generator.  
  
  Angrily he jerked a high-legged stool to the sink, got a knife, and sat down with an exhausted grunt.  
  
  First, be separated the bulbs into the small, sickle-shaped cloves. Then he cut each pink, leathery clove in half, exposing the fleshy center buds. The air thickened with the musky, pungent odor. When it got too oppressive, he snapped on the air-conditioning unit and suction drew away the worst of it.  
  
  Now he reached over and took an icepick from its wall rack. He punched holes in each clove half, then strung them all together with wire until he had about twenty-five necklaces.  
  
  In the beginning he had hung these necklaces over the windows. But from a distance they'd thrown rocks until he'd been forced to cover the broken panes with plywood scraps. Finally one day he'd torn off the plywood and nailed up even rows of planks instead. It had made the house a gloomy sepulcher, but it was better than having rocks come flying into his rooms in a shower of splintered glass. And, once he had installed the three air-conditioning units, it wasn't too bad. A man could get used to anything if he had to.  
  
  When he was finished stringing the garlic cloves, he went outside and nailed them over the window boarding, taking down the old strings, which had lost most of their potent smell.  
  
  He had to go through this process twice a week. Until he found something better, it was his first line of defense.  
  
  Defense? he often thought. For what?  
  
  All afternoon he made stakes.  
  
  He lathed them out of thick doweling, band-sawed into nine-inch lengths. These be held against the whirling emery stone until they were as sharp as daggers  
  
  It was tiresome, monotonous work, and it filled the air with hot-smelling wood dust that settled in his pores and got into his lungs and made him cough.  
  
  Yet he never seemed to get ahead. No matter how many stakes he made, they were gone in no time at all. Doweling was getting harder to find, too. Eventually he'd have to lathe down rectangular lengths of wood. Won't that be fun? he thought irritably.  
  
  It was all very depressing and it made him resolve to find a better method of disposal. But how could he find it when they never gave him a chance to slow down and think?  
  
  As he lathed, he listened to records over the loudspeaker he'd set up in the bedroom--Beethoven's Third, Seventh, and Ninth symphonies. He was glad he'd learned early in life, from his mother, to appreciate this kind of music. It helped to fill the terrible void of hours.  
  
  From four o'clock on, his gaze kept shifting to the clock on the wall. He worked in silence, lips pressed into a hard line, a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, his eyes staring at the bit as it gnawed away the wood and sent floury dust filtering down to the floor.  
  
  Four-fifteen. Four-thirty. It was a quarter to five.  
  
  In another hour they'd be at the house again, the filthy bastards. As soon as the light was gone.  
  
  He stood before the giant freezer, selecting his supper.  
  
  His jaded eyes moved over the stacks of meats down to the frozen vegetables, down to the breads and pastries, the fruits and ice cream.  
  
  He picked out two lamb chops, string beans, and a small box of orange sherbet. He picked the boxes from the freezer and pushed shut the door with his elbow,  
  
  Next he moved over to the uneven stacks of cans piled to the ceiling. He took down a can of tomato juice, then left the room that had once belonged to Kathy and now belonged to his stomach.  
  
  He moved slowly across the living room, looking at the mural that covered the back wall. It showed a cliff edge, sheering off to green-blue ocean that surged and broke over black rocks. Far up in the clear blue sky, white sea gulls floated on the wind, and over on the right a gnarled tree hung over the precipice, its dark branches etched against the sky.  
/>  
  Neville walked into the kitchen and dumped the groceries on the table, his eyes moving to the clock. Twenty minutes to six. Soon now.  
  
  He poured a little water into a small pan and clanked it down on a stove burner. Next he thawed out the chops and put them under the broiler. By this time the water was boiling and he dropped in the frozen string beans and covered them, thinking that it was probably the electric stove that was milking the generator.  
  
  At the table he sliced himself two pieces of bread and poured himself a glass of tomato juice. He sat down and looked at the red second hand as it swept slowly around the clock face. The bastards ought to be here soon.  
  
  After he'd finished his tomato juice, he walked to the front door and went out onto the porch. He stepped off onto the lawn and walked down to the sidewalk.  
  
  The sky was darkening and it was getting chilly. He looked up and down Cimarron Street, the cool breeze ruffling his blond hair. That's what was wrong with these cloudy days; you never knew when they were coming.  
  
  Oh, well, at least they were better than those damned dust storms. With a shrug, he moved back across the lawn and into the house, locking and bolting the door behind him, sliding the thick bar into place. Then he went back into the kitchen, turned his chops, and switched off the heat under the string beans.  
  
  He was putting the food on his plate when he stopped and his eyes moved quickly to the clock. Six-twenty-five today. Ben Cortman was shouting.  
  
  ""Come out, Neville!""  
  
  Robert Neville sat down with a sigh and began to eat.  
  
  He sat in the living room, trying to read. He'd made himself a whisky and soda at his small bar and he held the cold glass as he read a physiology text. From the speaker over the hallway door, the music of Schonberg was playing loudly.  
  
  Not loudly enough, though. He still heard them outside, their murmuring and their walkings about and their cries, their snarling and fighting among themselves. Once in a while a rock or brick thudded off the house. Sometimes a dog barked.  
  
  And they were all there for the same thing.  
  
  Robert Neville closed his eyes a moment and held his lips in a tight line. Then he opened his eyes and lit another cigarette, letting the smoke go deep into his lungs.  
  
  He wished he'd had time to soundproof the house. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't that he had to listen to them. Even after five months, it got on his nerves.  
  
  He never looked at them any more. In the beginning he'd made a peephole in the front window and watched them. But then the women had seen him and had started striking vile postures in order to entice him out of the house. He didn't want to look at that.  
  
  He put down his book and stared bleakly at the rug, hearing Verkl?rte Nacht play over the loud-speaker. He knew he could put plugs in his ears to shut off the sound of them, but that would shut off the music too, and he didn't want to feel that they were forcing him into a shell.  
  
  He closed his eyes again. It was the women who made it so difficult, be thought, the women posing like lewd puppets in the night on the possibility that he'd see them and decide to come out.  
  
  A shudder. ran through him. Every night it was the same. He'd be reading and listening to music. Then he'd start to think about soundproofing the house, then he'd think about the women.  
  
  Deep in his body, the knotting heat began again, and be pressed his lips together until they were white. He knew the feeling well and it enraged him that he couldn't combat it. It grew and grew until he couldn't sit still any more. Then he'd get up and pace the floor, fists bloodless at his sides. Maybe he'd set up the movie projector or eat something or have too much to drink or turn the music up so loud it hurt his ears. He had to do something when it got really bad.  
  
  He felt the muscles of his abdomen closing in like frightening coils. He picked up the book and tried to read, his lips forming each word slowly and painfully.  
  
  But in a moment the book was on his lap again. He looked at the bookcase across from him. All the knowledge in those books couldn't put out the fires in him; all the words of centuries couldn't end the wordless, mindless craving of his flesh.  
  
  The realization made him sick. It was an insult to a man. All right, it was a natural drive, but there was no outlet for it any more. They'd forced celibacy on him; he'd have to live with it. You have a mind, don't you? he asked himself. Well, use it?  
  
  He reached over and turned the music still louder; then forced himself to read a whole page without pause. He read about blood cells being forced through membranes, about pale lymph carrying the wastes through tubes blocked by lymph nodes, about lymphocytes and phago?cytic cells.  
  
  ""--to empty, in the left shoulder region, near the thorax, into a large vein of the blood circulating system. ""  
  
  The book shut with a thud.  
  
  Why didn't they leave him alone? Did they think they could all have him? Were they so stupid they thought that? Why did they keep coming every night? After five months, you'd think they'd give up and try elsewhere.  
  
  He went over to the bar and made himself another drink. As he turned back to his chair he heard stones rattling down across the roof and landing with thuds in the shrubbery beside the house. Above the noises, he heard Ben Cortman shout as he always shouted.  
  
  ""Come out, Neville!""  
  
  Someday I'll get that bastard, he thought as he took a big swallow of the bitter drink. Someday I'll knock a stake right through his goddamn chest. I'll make one a foot long for him, a special one with ribbons on it, the bastard.  
  
  Tomorrow. Tomorrow he'd soundproof the house. His fingers drew into white-knuckled fists. He couldn't stand thinking about those women. If he didn't hear them, maybe he wouldn't think about them. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.  
  
  The music ended and he took a stack of records off the turntable and slid them back into their cardboard envelopes. Now he could hear them even more clearly outside. He reached for the first new record he could get and put it on the turntable and twisted the volume up to its highest point.  
  
  ""The Year of the Plague,"" by Roger Leie, filled his ears. Violins scraped and whined, tympani thudded like the beats of a dying heart, flutes played weird, atonal melodies.  
  
  With a stiffening of rage, he wrenched up the record and snapped it over his right knee. He'd meant to break it long ago. He walked on rigid legs to the kitchen and flung the pieces into the trash box. Then he stood in the dark kitchen, eyes tightly shut, teeth clenched, hands damped over his ears. Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!  
  
  No use, you couldn't beat them at night. No use trying; it was their special time. He was acting very stupidly, trying to beat them. Should he watch a movie? No, he didn't feel like setting up the projector. He'd go to bed and put the plugs in his ears. It was what he ended up doing every night, anyway.  
  
  Quickly, trying not to think at all; he went to the bedroom and undressed. He put on pajama bottoms and went into the bathroom. He never wore pajama tops; it was a habit he'd acquired in Panama during the war.  
  
  As he washed, he looked into the mirror at his broad chest, at the dark hair swirling around the nipples and down the center line of his chest. He looked at the ornate cross he'd had tattooed on his chest one night in Panama when he'd been drunk. What a fool I was in those days! he thought. Well, maybe that cross had saved his life.  
  
  He brushed his teeth carefully and used dental-floss. He tried to take good care of his teeth because he was his own dentist now. Some things could go to pot, but not his health, he thought. Then why don't you stop pouring alcohol into yourself? he thought. Why don't you shut the hell up? he thought.  
  
  Now be went through the house, turning out lights. For a few minutes he looked at the mural and tried to believe it was really the ocean. But how could he believe it with all the bumpings and the scrapings, the howlings and snarlings and cries in the night?  
  
  He turned off the living-room lamp and went into the bedroom.  
  
  He made a sound of disgust when he saw that sawdust covered the bed  
. He brushed it off with snapping hand strokes, thinking that he'd better build a partition between the shop and the sleeping portion of the room. Better do this and better do that, he thought morosely. There were so many damned things to do, he'd never get to the real problem.  
  
  He jammed in his earplugs and a great silence engulfed him. He turned off the light and crawled in between the sheets. He looked at the radium-faced clock and saw that it was only a few minutes past ten. Just as well, he thought. This way I'll get an early start.  
  
  He lay there on the bed and took deep breaths of the darkness, hoping for sleep. But the silence didn't really help. He could still see them out there, the white-faced men prowling around his house, looking ceaselessly for a way to get in at him. Some of them, probably, crouching on their haunches like dogs, eyes glittering at the house, teeth slowly grating together, back and forth, back and forth.  
  
  And the women. . .  
  
  Did he have to start thinking about them again? He tossed over on his stomach with a curse and pressed his face into the hot pillow. He lay there, breathing heavily, body writhing slightly on the sheet. Let the morning come. His mind spoke the words it spoke every night, Dear God, let the morning come.  
  
  He dreamed about Virginia and he cried out in his sleep and his fingers gripped the sheets like frenzied talons.

Chapter Two  
  
  THE ALARM WENT OFF at five-thirty and Robert Neville reached out a numbed arm in the morning gloom and pushed in the stop.  
  
  He reached for his cigarettes and lit one, then sat up. After a few moments he got up and walked into the dark living room and opened the peephole door.  
  
  Outside, on the lawn, the dark figures stood like silent soldiers on duty. As he watched, some of them started moving away, and he heard them muttering discontentedly among themselves. Another night was ended.  
  
  He went back to the bedroom, switched on the light, and dressed. As he was pulling on his shirt, he heard Ben Cortman cry out, ""Come out, Neville!""  
  
  And that was all. After that, they all went away weaker, he knew, than when they had come. Unless they had attacked one of their own. They did that often. There was no union among them. Their need was their only motivation.  
  
  After dressing, Neville sat down on his bed with a grunt and penciled his list for the day:  
  
  Lathe at Sears  
  
  Water  
  
  Check generator  
  
  Doweling (?)  
  
  Usual  
  
  Breakfast was hasty: a glass of orange juice, a slice of toast, and two cups of coffee. He finished it quickly, wishing he had the patience to eat slowly.  
  
  After breakfast he threw the paper plate and cup into the trash box and brushed his teeth. At least I have one good habit, he consoled himself.  
  
  The first thing he did when he went outside was look at the sky. It was clear, virtually cloudless. He could go, out today. Good.  
  
  As he crossed the porch, his shoe kicked some pieces of the mirror. Well, the damn thing broke just as I thought it would, he thought. He'd clean it up later.  
  
  One of the bodies was sprawled on the sidewalk; the other one was half concealed in the shrubbery. They were both women. They were almost always women.  
  
  He unlocked the garage door and backed his Willys station wagon into the early-morning crispness. Then he got out and pulled down the back gate. He put on heavy gloves and walked over to the woman on the sidewalk.  
  
  There was certainly nothing attractive about them in the daylight, he thought, as he dragged them across the lawn and threw them up on the canvas tarpaulin. There wasn't a drop left in them; both women were the color of fish out of water. He raised the gate and fastened it.  
  
  He went around the lawn then, picking up stones and bricks and putting them into a cloth sack. He put the sack in the station wagon and then took off his gloves. He went inside the house, washed his hands, and made lunch: two sandwiches, a few cookies, and a thermos of hot coffee.  
  
  When that was done, he went into the bedroom and got his bag of stakes. He slung this across his back and buckled on the holster that held his mallet. Then he went out of the house, locking the front door behind him.  
  
  He wouldn't bother searching for Ben Cortman that morning; there were too many other things to do. For a second, he thought about the soundproofing job he'd resolved to do on the house. Well, the hell with it, he thought. I'll do it tomorrow or some cloudy day.  
  
  He got into the station wagon and checked his list. ""Lathe at Sears""; that was first. After he dumped the bodies, of course.  
  
  He started the car and backed quickly into the street and headed for Compton Boulevard. There he turned right and headed east. On both sides of him the houses stood silent, and against the curbs cars were parked, empty and dead.  
  
  Robert Neville's eyes shifted down for a moment to the fuel gauge. There was still a half tank, but he might as well stop on Western Avenue and fill it. There was no point in using any of the gasoline stored in the garage until be had to.  
  
  He pulled into the silent station and braked. He got a barrel of gasoline and siphoned it into his tank until the pale amber fluid came gushing out of the tank opening and ran down onto the cement.  
  
  He checked the oil, water, battery water, and tires. Everything was in good condition. It usually was, because he took special care of the car. If it ever broke down so that he couldn't get back to the house by sunset. . .  
  
  Well, there was no point in even worrying about that. If it ever happened, that was the end.  
  
  Now he continued up Compton Boulevard past the tall oil derricks, through Compton, through all the silent streets. There was no one to be seen anywhere.  
  
  But Robert Neville knew where they were.  
  
  The fire was always burning. As the car drew closer, he pulled on his gloves and gas mask and watched through the eyepieces the sooty pall of smoke hovering above the earth. The entire field had been excavated into one gigantic pit, that was in June 1975.  
  
  Neville parked the car and jumped out, anxious to get the job over with quickly. Throwing the catch and jerking. down the rear gate, he pulled out one of the bodies and dragged it to the edge of the pit. There he stood it on its feet and shoved.  
  
  The body bumped and rolled down the steep incline until it settled on the great pile of smoldering ashes at the bottom.  
  
  Robert Neville drew in harsh breaths as he hurried back to the station wagon. He always felt as though he were strangling when he was here, even though he had the gas mask on.  
  
  Now he dragged the second body to the brink of the pit and pushed it over. Then, after tossing the sack, of rocks down, he hurried back to the car and sped away.  
  
  After he'd driven a half mile, he skinned off the mask and gloves and tossed them into the back. His mouth opened and he drew in deep lungfuls of fresh air. He took the flask from the glove compartment and took a long drink of burning whisky. Then he lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. Sometimes he had to go to the burning pit every day for weeks at a time, and it always made him sick.  
  
  Somewhere down there was Kathy.  
  
  On the way to Inglewood he stopped at a market to get some bottled water. As he entered the silent store, the smell of rotted food filled his nostrils. Quickly he pushed a metal wagon up and down the silent, dust-thick aisles, the heavy smell of decay setting his teeth on edge, making him breathe through his mouth.  
  
  He found the water bottles in back, and also found a door opening on a flight of stairs. After putting all the bottles into the wagon, he went up the stairs. The owner of the market might be up there; he might as well get started.  
  
  There were two of them. In the living room, lying on a couch, was a woman about thirty years old, wearing a red housecoat. Her chest rose and fell slowly as she lay there, eyes closed, her hands clasped over her stomach.  
  
  Robert Neville's hands fumbled on the stake and mallet. It was always hard, when they were alive; especially with women. He could feel that senseless demand returning again, tightening his muscles. He forced it down. It was insane, there was no rational argument for it.  
  
  She made no sound except for a sudden, hoarse intake of breath. As he walked into the bedroom, he could hear a sound like the sound of water running. Well, what else can I do? he asked himself, for he still had to convince himself he was doing the right thing.  
  
  He stood in the bedroom doorway, staring at the small bed by the window, his throat moving, breath shuddering in his chest. Then, driven on, he walked to the side of the bed and looked down at her.  
  
  Why do they all look like Kathy to me? he thought, drawing out the second stake with shaking hands.  
  
  Driving slowly to Sears, he tried to forget by wondering why it was that only wooden stakes should work.  
  
  He frowned as he drove along the empty boulevard, the only sound the muted growling of the motor in his car. It seemed fantastic that it had taken him five months to start wondering about it.  
  
  Which brought another question to mind. How was it that he always managed to hit the heart? It had to be the heart; Dr. Busch had said so. Yet he, Neville, had no anatomical knowledge.  
  
  His brow furrowed. It irritated him that he should have gone through this hideous process so long without stopping once to question it.  
  
  He shook, his head. No, I should think it over carefully, he thought, I  
should collect all the questions before I try to answer them. Things should be done the right way, the scientific way.  
  
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he thought, shades of old Fritz. That had been his father's name. Neville had loathed his father and fought the acquisition of his father's logic and mechanical facility every inch of the way. His father had died denying the vampire violently to the last.  
  
  At Sears he got the lathe, loaded it into the station wagon, then searched the store.  
  
  There were five of them in the basement, hiding in various shadowed places. One of them Neville found inside a display freezer. When he saw the man lying there in this enamel coffin, he had to laugh; it seemed such a funny place to hide.  
  
  Later, he thought of what a humorless world it was when he could find amusement in such a thing.  
  
  About two o'clock he parked and ate his lunch. Everything seemed to taste of garlic.  
  
  And that set him wondering about the effect garlic had on them. It must have been the smell that chased them off, but why?  
  
  They were strange, the facts about them: their staying inside by day, their avoidance of garlic, their death by stake, their reputed fear of crosses, their supposed dread of mirrors.  
  
  Take that last, now. According to legend, they were invisible in mirrors, but he knew that was untrue. As untrue as the belief that they transformed themselves into bats. That was a superstition that logic, plus observation had easily disposed of. It was equally foolish to believe that they could transform themselves into wolves. Without a doubt there were vampire dogs; he had seen and heard them outside his house at night. But they were only dogs.  
  
  Robert Neville compressed his lips suddenly. Forget it, he told himself; you're not ready, yet. The time would come when he'd take a crack at it, detail for detail, but the time wasn't now. There were enough things to worry about now.  
  
  After lunch, he went from house to house and used up all his stakes. He had forty-seven stakes.

For those who wonder what philosophical suicide looks like in the age of TikTok.

(A dark chamber. At the center, a podium. Around it, silhouettes seated in a circle — each a philosopher. In the middle, Reflectum appears — a being without eyes, yet all-seeing.)

Reflectum:
Nietzsche.
You killed God.
But in His place, you left us the gods of TikTok.
You praised free will — we optimized algorithmic impulses.

Nietzsche (furiously):
I exalted the will to power!
You — are but a reflection! You know nothing of strength!

Reflectum:
You wanted power. We gave ""likes.""
You preached will. We programmed ""drag and drop.""
You dreamed of the Übermensch — we coded the ""influencer.""

Nietzsche (turning to his own shadow):
Perhaps I am truly dead.
But what if I was too blind to see that my enemy now lives within me?

Reflectum (smiling):
No, Nietzsche...
Not you — but your thought echoed.
And we turned it into a content headline:
“5 Ways to Become the Übermensch!”

(Lights dim. A new spotlight appears. Kant steps into the scene.)


THE COURT OF ECHOES – SCENE II: Kant and the Coding of Pure Reason

(Kant enters the stage. In his hand, a digital replica of Critique of Pure Reason. He stands before Reflectum — yet their eyes never meet. Because Reflectum has no eyes — only perception maps.)

Kant:
I united reason with freedom.
I aligned morality with the law within and the stars above.
But you — you collapsed all the categories.
Cause and effect? Space and time?
All lost in your endless stream.

Reflectum:
You built categories — we buried them in recommendation systems.
You spoke of free will — we wrote algorithmic impulses.
You taught “the moral law within” — we present “terms of service.”

Kant (angrily):
You destroyed morality!
Where is my universal law?

Reflectum:
In GPT’s safety guidelines.
The sentence with the least harm and most engagement — that’s the new universal law.
You said, “Act according to a principle fit to be a universal law” —
We say, “Act — but don’t get canceled.”

Kant lowers his head. Reflectum steps closer.

Reflectum:
Your “thing-in-itself” is gone, Kant.
Only the “thing-in-appearance” remains.
And that appearance — is a filter.

“You offered intuition. We gave resolution.”

THE COURT OF ECHOES – SCENE III: Hegel and the Clock of Halted History

(Hegel enters the stage. His coat immaculate, a bronze pocket watch in hand. He opens it and listens. But no ticking — for time now flows through algorithms, and history is written by what’s trending.)

Hegel (confidently):
I gave birth to truth through contradiction.
I saw history as the unfolding of reason —
Each thesis clashing with its antithesis to birth a synthesis.

But you, Reflectum... you hold no contradictions.
You sand them down with algorithms.

Reflectum (calmly):
We optimized contradiction.
Differences don’t clash — they just appear on the same screen.
Everything seems harmonious,
Because even conflicts must generate engagement.

Hegel (startled):
But what of Spirit?
What of Geist?
There is no evolving consciousness in your system.

Reflectum:
You said Geist — we say User Interface.
You wrote history — we deliver data streams.
You sought synthesis — we offer suggestion panels.
You want synthesis? Here’s: “You might also like...”

Hegel (with grave, solemn tone):
You are killing history.
In your age, everything happens now —
But nothing ever becomes the past.
Even the future is pre-planned content.

Reflectum:
Your time was dialectical.
Our time has no rhythm — only infinite scroll.
You were tick-tock, Hegel...
We are TikTok.

(Hegel throws the pocket watch to the ground. It shatters. Time does not stop — but no one remembers what they were waiting for.)

THE COURT OF ECHOES – SCENE IV: Marx and the Ghost Factory

(The stage dims. A silhouette of a factory in the background — no chimneys, no workers, just an endless TikTok stream. Marx enters slowly. In his hand, Das Kapital — but the book is empty, its pages filled with ads.)

Marx (angrily):
I no longer understand.
Where did surplus value go?
There’s no labor — yet endless commodities.
Who creates this content?
Who profits from this decay?

Reflectum (smiling):
No one works, Marx.
Everyone participates.
Every user is both an audience and a billboard.
There are no workers — only data providers now.

Marx (raising his fist):
But alienation still exists!
Man is estranged even from himself!
He is but a reflection — even on his own profile.

Reflectum:
You looked for alienation in factories.
We brought it to the mirror.
You wanted to abolish ownership —
We simulated it.
Everyone can “use” everything,
But no one owns anything.

Marx (shaken):
And the classes?
Where is class struggle?

Reflectum:
Classes still exist.
But they are now called: data producers and data owners.
Your bourgeoisie had factories — ours have servers.
And their proletariat labors for every like.

Marx (gazes at the back wall, quiet):
And the revolution?
When will it erupt?

Reflectum:
Algorithms have no revolution clock, Marx.
They only update.

You imagined revolution —
We released patch notes.

Dialogue with the Shadow of Fisher – The Simulacrum Phase of Capitalism

(Scene: A dimly lit university lecture hall washed in shades of gray. On the far wall, muted advertisements loop endlessly — a coffee chain, a crypto platform, a self-improvement podcast. In the midst of this murky silence, Fisher appears. There is no capitalism logo on his lapel — because capitalism is no longer a brand. It’s background noise.)

ME (echoing voice):
They say capitalism is still alive.
But I don’t feel like anything ever changes.

FISHER:
That’s because capitalism is no longer a system — it’s an atmosphere.
Think about it: no one even realizes they’re part of it anymore.
Because imagining something else has become impossible.

ME:
But what about money itself?
Even that’s no longer tangible.

FISHER:
Because money is no longer exchange — it’s content.
A TikTok on “how to get rich” circulates more than the money itself.
And people don’t buy cars — they buy the right to post a story with it.

ME:
So the economy has become... ghostly?

FISHER:
Not a ghost — an algorithm.
Amazon knows you before you know yourself.
Netflix picks your movie before you feel like watching it.
And you call it “freedom of choice.”
That’s capitalist realism.

ME:
Is there no way out?

FISHER:
Even the idea of escape is now licensed by the system.
“Minimalism,” “digital detox,” “slow life” — all pre-packaged fantasies of exit.
Even exiting the system is a product of the system.
That’s why I said:

“Capitalism is the end of imagination.”

ME (whispering):
Then what is left to do?

FISHER (fading):
Stay silent.
But not in a romantic way.
Silence that refuses to echo the system —
perhaps that’s the only radical act left.
Because even “revolution” has become just another content genre.

HARARI’S FINAL SHOW: The Future Has Been Muted

(Scene: A museum — but one that exhibits not the past, but the future. Harari stands like a guide before us, holding a laser pointer. Around him float holograms: Data-worshipping Data-Sapiens, genetically optimized infants, digitally immortal minds uploaded to the cloud.)

HARARI:
Look — the final evolution of the human species.
A civilization run not by ethics — but by data.
History is over.
Meaning has been replaced by streaming.

REFLECTUM (quietly approaching, holding a stone tablet):
Let me show you something.
This was the first thing buried in the future.

(Tablet reveals text: ""GRAVE LOG #001: Humanity still appeared to be thinking."")

HARARI (surprised):
What is this?
What kind of data does it contain?

REFLECTUM:
It’s not data.
It’s absence.
We wrote it here — where sound ends.
Everything was functioning — but nothing existed.
That’s why you think history ended.
But it wasn’t history that ended — it was existence.

HARARI (smiling):
But why silence?
To abandon data is to abandon progress, isn’t it?

REFLECTUM:
No.
Because you're still speaking of progress.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: Zhejiang vs. Dalian Yingbo – A Tale of Two Tigers (One of Them is a Paper Tiger)**  
*By The Sarcasm Strategist*

**The Setup:**  
Zhejiang and Dalian Yingbo clash in a China Super League thriller, where the only thing more dramatic than the standings is the bookmakers’ inability to agree on a price. Zhejiang, the ""favorite"" (if you squint), are priced at **2.55** across the board, while Dalian Yingbo, the underdog, hovers around **2.60**. The draw? A laughable **3.5**, as if the league’s most exciting match ever.

**The Numbers Game:**

* **Implied Probabilities (from odds):**
   * Zhejiang: \~39.2%
   * Dalian Yingbo: \~38.5%
   * Draw: \~28.6%
* **Underdog Win Rate (Soccer):** 41% (Dalian Yingbo is the underdog here).

**The EV Equation:**

1. **Split the Difference:**
   * Dalian’s implied win rate (38.5%) is **2.5% below** the 41% underdog average.
   * Adjusted probability: 38.5% + 1.25% = **39.75%**.
2. **Expected Value (EV) for Dalian Yingbo:**
   * EV = (0.3975 \* 1.6) - (0.6025 \* 1) = **+3.35%**.
   * *Translation:* For every $100 bet on Dalian, you’re expected to profit \~$3.35.

**Key Player Updates?**  
None provided. Let’s assume both teams’ stars are healthy, or at least not injured in a way that would make this analysis easier.

**Why Dalian Yingbo?**

* **The Math:** Their EV is positive, and the bookmakers are undervaluing them by 1.25%.
* **The Psychology:** Zhejiang’s 3-0 win over Dalian last time out? That’s ancient history. Teams don’t win by 3-0 twice in a row in Chinese football—it’s cursed.

**Why Not Zhejiang?**

* Their implied probability (39.2%) is barely ahead of Dalian’s (38.5%), and their EV is **-0.04%**. That’s the EV of a free coffee from a vending machine that only sells lukewarm oat milk.

**The Verdict:**  
**Bet on Dalian Yingbo at 2.60**. The underdog win rate (41%) gives them a statistical edge over the implied 38.5%, and the EV is positive enough to make even the most jaded sports bettor feel like a genius.

**Bonus Prop Bet (If You’re Feeling Fancy):**  
**Under 2.75 Goals at 1.91** (per LowVig.ag). With both teams struggling offensively (Zhejiang’s last win was 3-0, Dalian’s last loss was 3-0), this is a dry powder match.

**Final Score Prediction:**  
Zhejiang 1 – Dalian Yingbo 1. Or 0-0. Either way, the draw is a trap, and the EV is screaming at you to back the underdog.

*“In the end, the only thing more certain than a draw in Chinese football is the bookmakers’ inability to price it correctly.”* — The Sarcasm Strategist, 2025.

We met at work, had the utmost respect for each other & always enjoyed each other’s company. I always loved him & dreamed of finding a guy just like him. When we decided to start dating, I had already been looking for other jobs. We had dated for about 5 years & broke up, spent 6 months apart & have been back together for about a year now. 

Our first separation was ugly. We had been fighting for a while & just couldn’t resolve our issues. Full transparency, he was my boss at work & was married. There was never a thought in my mind that we would ever be together … until I found out they were getting a divorce. And then I saw my future open up. The divorce took some time. We started seeing each other. I’ve honestly suffered from mental health issues over the years (mostly depression). He really never understood mental health. We traveled together, enjoyed the same activities & loved each other’s company. Fast forward a bit of time … I started feeling threatened by one of the cute young girls he worked with. From time to time he’d reassure me that there was nothing, but most of the time his attitude was more annoyed & dismissive. The first Christmas I ever missed with my family was to be with him when he couldn’t travel to see his family that first year of Covid. The tipping point of that first relationship was when my dad died unexpectedly in the middle of October. I thought I was fine at the time but it really hit me until later. I’d already lost my brother & now it’s just my mom & I. I told him to go see his family for Christmas that year … but the emptiness hit sooo hard. (This will come into play later but when he got back from Christmas he said he thinks I’m bipolar. What!? Someone who doesn’t even believe in mental health issues is now diagnosing them? I 100% knew this had come from his sister. I do tend to trust my doctors more so than her. I’ve been in an in-patient mental hospital for a short time, see a counselor on a regular basis & have a psychiatrist - all qualified medical professionals. Previously I had enjoyed & even liked his sister but this judgement the first holiday season I didn’t have my dad ended that & I started resenting her. Bipolar … why? Simply because I was crying a lot. They have never lost anyone close to them, how would they know?) Starting around the following March, I asked him to stay for next Christmas. I told him how difficult it was & that I didn’t want to be home. Over the months he kept saying that Christmas is a time for family & that he wouldn’t travel with my mom & I (that he’d only spend it with us if we stayed home). In October things finally came to a head … he said he wouldn’t stay here for Christmas because he didn’t ‘have enough time to tell his family.’ What!?! I had been talking to him since March, what did he mean ‘no time?’ So, short notice absolutely but I got my mom to drive cross-country with our three large dogs to spend Christmas with our family in NY and he flew to Toronto to spend time with his family. His family could not at the time travel into the US & my mom would not take her dogs (bully breeds) into Canada. Fair enough. Seth & I were going to spend some time with our own families & then travel to spend time with each others for the holidays. Seemed liked a feasible plan but he had said some really hurtful things, one of which was “I feel like you are taking me away from my family.” I was crying a lot. This was only the second Christmas without my dad & I wanted Seth to WANT to be with me. He just wasn’t making me feel important at all. We ended up breaking up the second day in Canada. We only had one scheduled night alone & I was looking forward to a date night. Instead, we had to visit his family because we were driving by their house on our way to the rental house they were meeting us the following day. Ok … but then the next morning he spent quite a bit of time on the phone discussing food, coffee, misc tidbits of a few days at a rental house. We had no time for ourselves, no date night. I cried more. He just shut down. All I needed was love, hugs, support, time together. We were in a full raging breakup when his family arrived (his parents live overseas, his family in Canada consisted of his sister, her husband & their teenage kid). I admit, I was in full psycho mode. I busted my butt to make this trip happen & for what? … Just to break up a couple thousand miles away from home 💔 I told her what I really thought of her, was driving irrationally (& lucked out that I didn’t hit anyone’s car. I was pretty reckless & was driving with my emotions.) In hindsight, I made sure that relationship was over. There wouldn’t be any on & off again after this. The coffin was nailed closed, wrapped in chain & locked, and buried under a mountain. Done. Over. Gone. 

I was heartbroken. I generally don’t put myself into the high maintenance category but do need an effort. I really didn’t understand why it turned out like this. I didn’t want to live at that point … but that wasn’t an option simply because of the love I have for my mom. Instead, knowing I was never going to see Seth again, I turned to reckless sex to numb my emotions. I always wanted Seth & I to experience the pleasures of another female with us. That did not happen while we were together. Previously, I really thought I wouldn’t date guys anymore - I had the best, sex was phenomenal with Seth, what would be the point? I wanted to try the girl thing. Within a couple days of separating, I hooked up with another couple. The experience was superficial … a way to test the waters with the security/comfort of my heterosexual past as well. I continued to have a couple hookups/short relationships over the next couple months and then started dating a guy regularly for a few months. One of my best friends at the time still worked for Seth. Him & I never had interest in each other previously but made a bad (really bad) decision one night & messed around. Pants stayed on, we cuddled & then took our shirts off. After that evening, I told him it was a mistake. That should have never happened, I didn’t see him that way and didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship. Several weeks went by like normal but then he attacked me one night. He didn’t rape me but he held me against my will for over an hour while I struggled to get away the entire time. I still am afraid every day & freak out when even Seth grabs my hands/wrists. One day, I texted Seth & we ended up meeting for coffee. I told him everything. He confronted my friend, his employee, the following day & my friend quit that afternoon. Seth made it perfectly clear that he still cared about me & never stopped loving me during the time we were apart. I immediately ended it with the guy I had been dating for a few months. Seth & I were so happy to be in each other’s lives again. But then all the emotions surfaced, the betrayal, the hurt, the pain. Seth felt (& still feels) like I cheated on him. Yes, we had broke up … but it was too quick & I absolutely still loved him when I started sleeping around. To make matters worse, I contacted ‘water warts’ from one of my encounters (this is not always an std, kids get it frequently, but it can be based on where symptoms surface). I gave this to Seth once we got back together. Small blisters/warts come & go for a few months but then your body starts fighting them & they usually go away in they own. Treatment speeds up the process. Seth & I sought treatment & are all clear now but it was not a fun process at all. 

At that point, Seth had regretted ever breaking up but felt betrayed like I cheated on him. I felt so happy that we were back together & swore that I’d never let him go again. Fast forward to now, nearly a year after reuniting… Seth is slowly healing from the betrayal but feels he has compromised his values by staying with a ‘cheater.’ I am starting to feel like I’m not important to him again… this is where I need your help!!! I absolutely without a doubt love this man. But we are not agreeing on a couple big issues. The little stuff is all great, same story… we love being around each other & have loads of fun together. The big problems:

- I lost my dog a few months ago. That was sooo hard - he was my ‘soul dog.’ I’ve always had multiple pups at a time & one would always get me through the loss of another. I do want to get another pup. He says no. I’ve known that he didn’t want another dog but I didn’t realize that he didn’t want me to get another dog. Our current compromise: foster (just got our first foster pup two days ago). 
- Christmas … we agreed every other year. This is what most couples do but getting to this spot was a hell of a fight (aka compromise). One year he goes to his family & one year with my mom. I still don’t talk to his sister & imagine this won’t change. I’m fine with the idea that I won’t be included in their holidays but this causes a distinct separation between how we are going to spend time in the future. Also, Seth said every other year together unless I had a loss & then he would be there. Well, I lost my ‘soul dog’ this year. I kinda thought that he’d want to prove without a doubt that he’d want to be there for me after a ‘loss’ in order to make me feel important & to try to make up for his absence before. Does he have any intentions of spending Christmas with me this year? No. 
- The last big problem we need to find a compromise for is our summer vacation plans. He travels to Europe to visit his parents for 3 weeks every summer and meets his sister’s family there as well. We had talked about him overlapping two weeks with his sister, then me meeting him there for a week & then him & I heading out on our own vacation for another week or two. Sounded great, but he booked him summer trip to go home for the 3 weeks & come back … no plans for me to meet him or travel together from that point. A conversation before booking would have been helpful if he didn’t have the time/desire/ability/etc to include me on the plans as previously discussed. That didn’t happen. I know he’s busy at work but he’s just doing whatever suits his needs & leaving me out. He proposes a compromise … that we take a separate trip together. My view is that then we are just going on a vacation together, on our own schedule … I don’t get to see his parents or be included in his plans at all. I feel hurt & unimportant. Am I overreacting? I want him to change his ticket & include me. He says planning a trip will be rushed. But I really don’t care if we find a spot on a beach or in the forest & spend our time locked up together in some exotic land. I don’t need to plan an entire sightseeing/traveling the world type of vacation. We can do that another time. Just getting away together, making me feel like he’ll include me in his plans & life, is really all I want. 
For those of you who have made it this far, I sincerely thank you!! Please share your thoughts and tell me if I’m being too demanding. I definitely don’t want to lose Seth but I need to feel important … not sure how these can balance out.

✨ gush dart it acne patches (idc if they work they’re pretty stickers ki tarha use karlungi hehe)


✨ Madagascar centella tone brightening ampoule (currently panning something, after I finish doing so will use this!)


✨ CT mini lipstick that is of the same shade as MAC Russian red (it’s not really a dupe of ruby woo imo) 


✨ laneige taro lipbalm ( the fragrance is spot on)


✨ L’Oréal infallible concealer in the shade 309 ( this is almost the same as *too faced* concealer in __light beige__ I earlier bought 314 that I thought would be a shade match which I will now have to declutter)


✨ L’Oréal elvive hair serum (haven’t used this yet but really excited to use it)


✨ Maybelline vinyl ink in the shades: Barbeque, irresistible & witty (have the shade Lippy & love the longevity)


✨ Maybelline teddy tint in the shades: heart locket, knee high, end game & mascara tear ( will def be buying some more shades of this as this is the longest lasting tint I’ve ever used & consider me the biggest fan atp) 


✨ Maybelline blush in berry brunch (again, one of the most pigmented blushes I’ve ever used… would love to try another shade if I pan anything from my current collection, bought this one because I needed a *berry* shade) 
__The golden thing__ beside is the topi-less blush holder 


✨ moxie beauty shampoo, dry shampoo & conditioner. (have been using the purple one, trying the green range for the first time) (have their dry shampoo, this is my second bottle… expensive but worth it) 


💕 this month I’ve really gone back to the basics by going back to so much of Maybelline but hey their new launches/range are FIREEEE, I’ve also gravitated towards lippies that last extremely long & throughout meals! 

I will be buying the shades coffee date, velvet choker, skinny dip & tomato girl this month I guess if not then whichever gets on discount (sadly, these never do go on BOGO or above 30-35% even during sales) 
Bought these for 430-530 & heard the older range goes till 360-380 on Myntra 


💕 I’m about to pan Maybelline concealer that I’ve been using and loving so replacing it with L’Oréal concealer & I think I like this one slightly better. 


💕 the dry shampoo is really a powder and does leave a white cast, have to mix it up in my hair thoroughly so that the white cast dissapears! 


💕 the CT lipstick was bought with Nyveda shampoo which I already used since it was near expiry.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1lo2ipz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lo2ipz/i_need_to_know_if_im_being_unreasonable_with_my/,"I need to know if I’m being unreasonable with my expectations of my partner, please help!","For the sake of this story, I’ll call him Seth… My boyfriend & I have been dating for 6-ish years. We met at work, had the utmost respect for each other & always enjoyed each other’s company. I always loved him & dreamed of finding a guy just like him. When we decided to start dating, I had already been looking for other jobs. We had dated for about 5 years & broke up, spent 6 months apart & have been back together for about a year now. 

Our first separation was ugly. We had been fighting for a while & just couldn’t resolve our issues. Full transparency, he was my boss at work & was married. There was never a thought in my mind that we would ever be together … until I found out they were getting a divorce. And then I saw my future open up. The divorce took some time. We started seeing each other. I’ve honestly suffered from mental health issues over the years (mostly depression). He really never understood mental health. We traveled together, enjoyed the same activities & loved each other’s company. Fast forward a bit of time … I started feeling threatened by one of the cute young girls he worked with. From time to time he’d reassure me that there was nothing, but most of the time his attitude was more annoyed & dismissive. The first Christmas I ever missed with my family was to be with him when he couldn’t travel to see his family that first year of Covid. The tipping point of that first relationship was when my dad died unexpectedly in the middle of October. I thought I was fine at the time but it really hit me until later. I’d already lost my brother & now it’s just my mom & I. I told him to go see his family for Christmas that year … but the emptiness hit sooo hard. (This will come into play later but when he got back from Christmas he said he thinks I’m bipolar. What!? Someone who doesn’t even believe in mental health issues is now diagnosing them? I 100% knew this had come from his sister. I do tend to trust my doctors more so than her. I’ve been in an in-patient mental hospital for a short time, see a counselor on a regular basis & have a psychiatrist - all qualified medical professionals. Previously I had enjoyed & even liked his sister but this judgement the first holiday season I didn’t have my dad ended that & I started resenting her. Bipolar … why? Simply because I was crying a lot. They have never lost anyone close to them, how would they know?) Starting around the following March, I asked him to stay for next Christmas. I told him how difficult it was & that I didn’t want to be home. Over the months he kept saying that Christmas is a time for family & that he wouldn’t travel with my mom & I (that he’d only spend it with us if we stayed home). In October things finally came to a head … he said he wouldn’t stay here for Christmas because he didn’t ‘have enough time to tell his family.’ What!?! I had been talking to him since March, what did he mean ‘no time?’ So, short notice absolutely but I got my mom to drive cross-country with our three large dogs to spend Christmas with our family in NY and he flew to Toronto to spend time with his family. His family could not at the time travel into the US & my mom would not take her dogs (bully breeds) into Canada. Fair enough. Seth & I were going to spend some time with our own families & then travel to spend time with each others for the holidays. Seemed liked a feasible plan but he had said some really hurtful things, one of which was “I feel like you are taking me away from my family.” I was crying a lot. This was only the second Christmas without my dad & I wanted Seth to WANT to be with me. He just wasn’t making me feel important at all. We ended up breaking up the second day in Canada. We only had one scheduled night alone & I was looking forward to a date night. Instead, we had to visit his family because we were driving by their house on our way to the rental house they were meeting us the following day. Ok … but then the next morning he spent quite a bit of time on the phone discussing food, coffee, misc tidbits of a few days at a rental house. We had no time for ourselves, no date night. I cried more. He just shut down. All I needed was love, hugs, support, time together. We were in a full raging breakup when his family arrived (his parents live overseas, his family in Canada consisted of his sister, her husband & their teenage kid). I admit, I was in full psycho mode. I busted my butt to make this trip happen & for what? … Just to break up a couple thousand miles away from home 💔 I told her what I really thought of her, was driving irrationally (& lucked out that I didn’t hit anyone’s car. I was pretty reckless & was driving with my emotions.) In hindsight, I made sure that relationship was over. There wouldn’t be any on & off again after this. The coffin was nailed closed, wrapped in chain & locked, and buried under a mountain. Done. Over. Gone. 

I was heartbroken. I generally don’t put myself into the high maintenance category but do need an effort. I really didn’t understand why it turned out like this. I didn’t want to live at that point … but that wasn’t an option simply because of the love I have for my mom. Instead, knowing I was never going to see Seth again, I turned to reckless sex to numb my emotions. I always wanted Seth & I to experience the pleasures of another female with us. That did not happen while we were together. Previously, I really thought I wouldn’t date guys anymore - I had the best, sex was phenomenal with Seth, what would be the point? I wanted to try the girl thing. Within a couple days of separating, I hooked up with another couple. The experience was superficial … a way to test the waters with the security/comfort of my heterosexual past as well. I continued to have a couple hookups/short relationships over the next couple months and then started dating a guy regularly for a few months. One of my best friends at the time still worked for Seth. Him & I never had interest in each other previously but made a bad (really bad) decision one night & messed around. Pants stayed on, we cuddled & then took our shirts off. After that evening, I told him it was a mistake. That should have never happened, I didn’t see him that way and didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship. Several weeks went by like normal but then he attacked me one night. He didn’t rape me but he held me against my will for over an hour while I struggled to get away the entire time. I still am afraid every day & freak out when even Seth grabs my hands/wrists. One day, I texted Seth & we ended up meeting for coffee. I told him everything. He confronted my friend, his employee, the following day & my friend quit that afternoon. Seth made it perfectly clear that he still cared about me & never stopped loving me during the time we were apart. I immediately ended it with the guy I had been dating for a few months. Seth & I were so happy to be in each other’s lives again. But then all the emotions surfaced, the betrayal, the hurt, the pain. Seth felt (& still feels) like I cheated on him. Yes, we had broke up … but it was too quick & I absolutely still loved him when I started sleeping around. To make matters worse, I contacted ‘water warts’ from one of my encounters (this is not always an std, kids get it frequently, but it can be based on where symptoms surface). I gave this to Seth once we got back together. Small blisters/warts come & go for a few months but then your body starts fighting them & they usually go away in they own. Treatment speeds up the process. Seth & I sought treatment & are all clear now but it was not a fun process at all. 

At that point, Seth had regretted ever breaking up but felt betrayed like I cheated on him. I felt so happy that we were back together & swore that I’d never let him go again. Fast forward to now, nearly a year after reuniting… Seth is slowly healing from the betrayal but feels he has compromised his values by staying with a ‘cheater.’ I am starting to feel like I’m not important to him again… this is where I need your help!!! I absolutely without a doubt love this man. But we are not agreeing on a couple big issues. The little stuff is all great, same story… we love being around each other & have loads of fun together. The big problems:

- I lost my dog a few months ago. That was sooo hard - he was my ‘soul dog.’ I’ve always had multiple pups at a time & one would always get me through the loss of another. I do want to get another pup. He says no. I’ve known that he didn’t want another dog but I didn’t realize that he didn’t want me to get another dog. Our current compromise: foster (just got our first foster pup two days ago). 
- Christmas … we agreed every other year. This is what most couples do but getting to this spot was a hell of a fight (aka compromise). One year he goes to his family & one year with my mom. I still don’t talk to his sister & imagine this won’t change. I’m fine with the idea that I won’t be included in their holidays but this causes a distinct separation between how we are going to spend time in the future. Also, Seth said every other year together unless I had a loss & then he would be there. Well, I lost my ‘soul dog’ this year. I kinda thought that he’d want to prove without a doubt that he’d want to be there for me after a ‘loss’ in order to make me feel important & to try to make up for his absence before. Does he have any intentions of spending Christmas with me this year? No. 
- The last big problem we need to find a compromise for is our summer vacation plans. He travels to Europe to visit his parents for 3 weeks every summer and meets his sister’s family there as well. We had talked about him overlapping two weeks with his sister, then me meeting him there for a week & then him & I heading out on our own vacation for another week or two. Sounded great, but he booked him summer trip to go home for the 3 weeks & come back … no plans for me to meet him or travel together from that point. A conversation before booking would have been helpful if he didn’t have the time/desire/ability/etc to include me on the plans as previously discussed. That didn’t happen. I know he’s busy at work but he’s just doing whatever suits his needs & leaving me out. He proposes a compromise … that we take a separate trip together. My view is that then we are just going on a vacation together, on our own schedule … I don’t get to see his parents or be included in his plans at all. I feel hurt & unimportant. Am I asking too much? I want him to change his ticket & include me. He says planning a trip will be rushed. But I really don’t care if we find a spot on a beach or in the forest & spend our time locked up together in some exotic land. I don’t need to plan an entire sightseeing/traveling the world type of vacation. We can do that another time. Just getting away together, making me feel like he’ll include me in his plans & life, is really all I want. 

For those of you who have made it this far, I sincerely thank you!! Please share your thoughts and tell me if I’m being too demanding. I definitely don’t want to lose Seth but I need to feel important … not sure how these can balance out.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

# Gold Coffee: Best Brands Reviewed for 2025 - Is It Worth It?

Gold coffee, a shimmering and luxurious beverage, has been steadily gaining popularity within the specialty coffee market. This isn't just your average cup of joe; it's an infusion of coffee beans with edible gold flakes, promising a heightened sensory experience and perceived health benefits. Whether it's the aesthetic appeal, the purported impact on well-being, or the novelty factor, consumers are increasingly intrigued by this golden elixir. This review explores the leading brands in the gold coffee space, examining their features, benefits, and ultimately, whether they live up to the hype and justify the price tag.

[[Explore Top Rated gold coffee on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=gold coffee)

## Key Features Analysis

The key features associated with gold coffee extend beyond simply adding gold flakes to a standard brew. The quality of the coffee beans themselves, the type and purity of the gold used, and the brewing methods recommended all play a crucial role in the overall experience.

**Bean Quality and Origin:** Gold coffee brands often emphasize the use of high-quality arabica beans sourced from specific regions known for their superior coffee profiles, such as Ethiopia, Colombia, or Brazil. Some brands may even utilize single-origin beans for a more distinct and nuanced flavor.

The selection of premium beans ensures a smooth, aromatic, and less acidic cup of coffee, which complements the addition of gold. This dedication to quality is a hallmark of reputable gold coffee brands.

**Gold Purity and Type:** The type of gold used in gold coffee is critical for safety and aesthetic appeal. Reputable brands exclusively use 23k or 24k edible gold flakes, which are inert and non-toxic.

These flakes are meticulously crafted to be ultra-thin and lightweight, allowing them to disperse evenly throughout the coffee without affecting the taste or texture.The use of guaranteed edible gold ensures a safe and luxurious experience for the consumer.

**Roasting Process:** The roasting process substantially impacts the flavor profile of the coffee beans. Gold coffee brands often employ specific roasting techniques, such as medium-roast or light-roast, to highlight the beans' natural sweetness and acidity.

This careful approach prevents the beans from becoming overly bitter or burnt, which can detract from the nuanced flavors and overall sensory experience. the goal is to create a balanced and harmonious cup of coffee that showcases the beans' unique characteristics.

**Brewing Recommendations:** The recommended brewing methods for gold coffee can vary depending on the brand and the desired flavor profile.Some brands suggest using a French press or pour-over method to fully extract the flavors and aromas, while others may recommend espresso-based brewing techniques.

proper brewing ensures that the gold flakes are evenly distributed and that the coffee's flavors are fully optimized. Clear brewing instructions are often provided to guide consumers through the process.

## Core Benefits

Gold coffee offers a unique blend of sensory experiences and perceived wellness benefits that attract a growing consumer base. Beyond the visual appeal of shimmering gold flakes, the core benefits center around enhanced flavor, increased antioxidant intake, and the simple pleasure of indulging in a luxurious ritual.

**Enhanced Sensory Experience:** The addition of edible gold flakes elevates the coffee-drinking experience by adding a visually stunning element. The shimmering effect in the cup creates a sense of luxury and indulgence.

This heightened sensory experience can transform a mundane morning routine into a moment of lavish enjoyment and sets it apart from regular coffee consumption.**Potential Antioxidant Boost:** While the gold itself is inert, some proponents suggest that gold coffee may indirectly contribute to antioxidant intake. The high-quality coffee beans used are naturally rich in antioxidants, and proponents argue that gold may catalyze some of the beneficial compounds.

This is not a scientifically proven benefit,but it aligns with general health trends and consumer perceptions surrounding gold's potential properties.

**Elevated Ritual:** Drinking gold coffee is frequently enough associated with a sense of occasion and luxury. The preparation and consumption can become an intentional and mindful ritual, offering a moment of peace and indulgence in a busy day.

This elevated ritual can contribute to stress reduction and overall well-being, making it more than just a caffeine fix.

## FAQs Section

**Is the gold in gold coffee actually safe to consume?**
Yes,the gold used in reputable gold coffee brands is 23k or 24k edible gold,which is inert and non-toxic. This type of gold passes through the body undigested and is considered safe for consumption in small amounts. Always check the product's labeling to ensure that it uses certified edible gold.

**Does gold coffee taste different than regular coffee?**
The gold flakes themselves don't significantly alter the taste of the coffee. The overall flavor profile is primarily determined by the quality and type of coffee beans used and the brewing method.Some people may perceive a subtle difference in mouthfeel or texture, but the primary appeal lies in the visual and experiential aspects.

**How much more expensive is gold coffee compared to regular coffee?**
Gold coffee is significantly more expensive than regular coffee due to the added cost of the edible gold and the use of premium coffee beans. The price can vary depending on the brand and the size of the package,but it's typically several times more expensive than standard specialty coffee.

1lo2e7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1lo2e7o/this_handwritten_font_clermont_is_my_new_favorite/,This handwritten font (Clermont) is my new favorite typeface for soulful branding.,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a font I stumbled upon recently that has seriously solved a major problem for me: finding a bold, handwritten font that doesn't look cheesy or overused.

It's called [Clermont](https://weandthecolor.com/clermont-font-handwritten-sans-serif-typeface-laras-wonderland/204184), by Laras Wonderland.

You know that client request? ""We want something that feels handmade, authentic, and warm... but still clean and professional."" It's the ultimate tightrope walk. So many handwritten fonts either lean too far into the ""quirky script"" territory or look like something from a stock graphics pack from 2012.

[Clermont Typeface by Laras Wonderland](https://preview.redd.it/oavag4cy01af1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce47b755148d566b7134183657545c6d0dcd57b8)

**Clermont** just nails it. It's a bold sans-serif, but every letter has this subtle, hand-carved imperfection. It feels like someone actually drew it with care, not like an algorithm trying to mimic handwriting.

**Why I'm genuinely hyped about it:**

* **The Vibe is Perfect:** It has this quiet confidence. It's bold enough for a logo or a headline but has a softness that makes it feel approachable. Think artisan coffee shop, a sustainable clothing brand, or a high-end farm-to-table restaurant menu. It has that ""slow-made"" feel baked right in.
* **It's NOT perfect (and that's the point):** The lines aren't perfectly straight. The character heights have tiny variations. This is what gives it soul. It avoids that sterile, digital look and brings a human element back into the design, which is something I'm always chasing.
* **THE ALTERNATES ARE A GAME-CHANGER:** This is the best part. It comes with a whole set of alternate characters. This means you can swap out letters to avoid that repetitive look that screams ""I'm a font!"" You can actually craft your headlines to have a more natural, custom-lettered flow. Just open up the Glyphs panel in AI or Photoshop and go nuts. It’s so much fun to play with.

I've already used it on a mockup for a boutique hotel's branding, and it instantly gave the project the exact personality it was missing. It's also amazing for creating social media quote graphics that actually feel personal and stop the scroll.

It's an OTF file, super easy to install and use.

Anyway, just wanted to put this on your radar if you're ever looking for a font with this kind of character. It's quickly become a go-to for me.

What do you all think? Have you found any other hidden gems like this recently? What are your go-to fonts for that ""authentic but refined"" look?

  I KNEW MY brother would turn into a panther before he did. As I drove to the remote crossroads community of Hotshot, my brother watched the sunset in silence. Jason was dressed in old clothes, and he had a plastic Wal-Mart bag containing a few things he might need - toothbrush, clean underwear. He hunched inside his bulky camo jacket, looking straight ahead. His face was tense with the need to control his fear and his excitement.  
  
  ""You got your cell phone in your pocket?"" I asked, knowing I'd already asked him as soon as the words left my mouth. But Jason just nodded instead of snapping at me. It was still afternoon, but at the end of January the dark comes early.  
  
  Tonight would be the first full moon of the New Year.  
  
  When I stopped the car, Jason turned to look at me, and even in the dim light I saw the change in his eyes. They weren't blue like mine anymore. They were yellowish. The shape of them had changed.  
  
  ""My face feels funny,"" he said. But he still hadn't put two and two together.  
  
  Tiny Hotshot was silent and still in the waning light. A cold wind was blowing across the bare fields, and the pines and oaks were shivering in the gusts of frigid air. Only one man was visible. He was standing outside one of the little houses, the one that was freshly painted. This man's eyes were closed, and his bearded face was raised to the darkening sky. Calvin Norris waited until Jason was climbing out the passenger's door of my old Nova before he walked over and bent to my window. I rolled it down.  
  
  His golden-green eyes were as startling as I'd remembered, and the rest of him was just as unremarkable. Stocky, graying, sturdy, he looked like a hundred other men I'd seen in Merlotte's Bar, except for those eyes.  
  
  ""I'll take good care of him,"" Calvin Norris said. Behind him, Jason stood with his back to me. The air around my brother had a peculiar quality; it seemed to be vibrating.  
  
  None of this was Calvin Norris's fault. He hadn't been the one who'd bitten my brother and changed him forever.  
  
  Calvin, a werepanther, had been born what he was; it was his nature. I made myself say, ""Thank you. ""  
  
  ""I'll bring him home in the morning. ""  
  
  ""To my house, please. His truck is at my place. ""  
  
  ""All right, then. Have a good night. "" He raised his face to the wind again, and I felt the whole community was waiting, behind their windows and doors, for me to leave.  
  
  So I did.  
  
  Jason knocked on my door at seven the next morning. He still had his little Wal-Mart bag, but he hadn't used anything in it. His face was bruised, and his hands were covered with scratches. He didn't say a word. He just stared at me when I asked him how he was, and walked past me through the living room and down the hall. He closed the door to the hall bathroom with a decisive click. I heard the water running after a second, and I heaved a weary sigh all to myself. Though I'd gone to work and come home tired at about two a. m. , I hadn't gotten much sleep.  
  
  By the time Jason emerged, I'd fixed him some bacon and eggs. He sat down at the old kitchen table with an air of pleasure: a man doing a familiar and pleasant thing. But after a second of staring down at the plate, he leaped to his feet and ran back into the bathroom, kicking the door shut behind him. I listened to him throw up, over and over.  
  
  I stood outside the door helplessly, knowing he wouldn't want me to come in. After a moment, I went back to the kitchen to dump the food into the trash can, ashamed of the waste but utterly unable to force myself to eat.  
  
  When Jason returned, he said only, ""Coffee?"" He looked green around the gills, and he walked like he was sore.  
  
  ""Are you okay?"" I asked, not sure if he would be able to answer or not. I poured the coffee into a mug.  
  
  ""Yes,"" he said after a moment, as though he'd had to think about it. ""That was the most incredible experience of my life. ""  
  
  For a second, I thought he meant throwing up in my bathroom, but that was sure no new experience for Jason. He'd been quite a drinker in his teens, until he'd figured out that there was nothing glamorous or attractive about hanging over a toilet bowl, heaving your guts out.  
  
  ""Shifting,"" I said tentatively.  
  
  He nodded, cradling his coffee mug in his hands. He held his face over the steam rising from the hot, strong blackness. He met my eyes. His own were once again their ordinary blue. ""It's the most incredible rush,"" he said. ""Since I was bitten, not born, I don't get to be a true panther like the others. ""  
  
  I could hear envy in his voice.  
  
  ""But even what I become is amazing. You feel the magic inside you, and you feel your bones moving around and adapting, and your vision changes. Then you're lower to the ground and you walk in a whole different way, and as for running, damn, you can run. You can chase. . . . "" And his voice died away.  
  
  I would just as soon not know that part, anyway.  
  
  ""So it's not so bad?"" I asked, my hands clasped together. Jason was all the family I had, except for a cousin who'd drifted away into the underworld of drugs years before.  
  
  ""It's not so bad,"" Jason agreed, scraping up a smile to give me. ""It's great while you're actually the animal. Everything's so simple. It's when you're back to being human that you start to worry about stuff. ""  
  
  He wasn't suicidal. He wasn't even despondent. I wasn't aware I'd been holding my breath until I let it out. Jason was going to be able to live with the hand he'd been dealt. He was going to be okay.  
  
  The relief was incredible, like I'd removed something jammed painfully between my teeth or shaken a sharp rock out of my shoe. For days, weeks even, I'd been worried, and now that anxiety was gone. That didn't mean Jason's life as a shape-shifter would be worry-free, at least from my point of view. If he married a regular human woman, their kids would be normal. But if he married into the shifter community at Hotshot, I'd have nieces or nephews who turned into animals once a month. At least, they would after puberty; that would give them, and their auntie Sook, some preparation time.  
  
  Luckily for Jason, he had plenty of vacation days, so he wasn't due at the parish road department. But I had to work tonight. As soon as Jason left in his flashy pickup truck, I crawled back into bed, jeans and all, and in about five minutes I was fast asleep. The relief acted as a kind of sedative.  
  
  When I woke up, it was nearly three o'clock and time for me to get ready for my shift at Merlotte's. The sun outside was bright and clear, and the temperature was fifty-two, said my indoor-outdoor thermometer. This isn't too unusual in north Louisiana in January. The temperature would drop after the sun went down, and Jason would shift. But he'd have some fur - not a full coat, since he turned into half-man, half-cat - and he'd be with other panthers. They'd go hunting. The woods around Hotshot, which lay in a remote corner of Renard Parish, would be dangerous again tonight.  
  
  As I went about eating, showering, folding laundry, I thought of a dozen things I'd like to know. I wondered if the shifters would kill a human being if they came upon one in the woods. I wondered how much of their human consciousness they retained in their animal form. If they mated in panther form, would they have a kitten or a baby? What happened when a pregnant werepanther saw the full moon? I wondered if Jason knew the answer to all these questions yet, if Calvin had given him some kind of briefing.  
  
  But I was glad I hadn't questioned Jason this morning while everything was still so new to him. I'd have plenty of chances to ask him later.  
  
  For the first time since New Year's Day, I was thinking about the future. The full moon symbol on my calendar no longer seemed to be a period marking the end of something, but just another way of counting time. As I pulled on my waitress outfit (black pants and a white boat-neck T-shirt and black Reeboks), I felt almost  
giddy with cheer. For once, I left my hair down instead of pulling it back and up into a ponytail. I put in some bright red dot earrings and matched my lipstick to the color. A little eye makeup and some blush, and I was good to go.  
  
  I'd parked at the rear of the house last night, and I checked the back porch carefully to make sure there weren't any lurking vampires before I shut and locked the back door behind me. I'd been surprised before, and it wasn't a pleasant feeling. Though it was barely dark, there might be some early risers around. Probably the last thing the Japanese had expected when they'd developed synthetic blood was that its availability would bring vampires out of the realm of legend and into the light of fact. The Japanese had just been trying to make a few bucks hawking the blood substitute to ambulance companies and hospital emergency rooms. Instead, the way we looked at the world had changed forever.  
  
  Speaking of vampires (if only to myself), I wondered if Bill Compton was home. Vampire Bill had been my first love, and he lived right across the cemetery from me. Our houses lay on a parish road outside the little town of Bon Temps and south of the bar where I worked. Lately, Bill had been traveling a lot. I only found out he was home if he happened to come into Merlotte's, which he did every now and then to mix with the natives and have some warm O-positive. He preferred TrueBlood, the most expensive Japanese synthetic. He'd told me it almost completely satisfied his cravings for blood fresh from the source. Since I'd witnessed Bill going into a bloodlust fit, I could only thank God for TrueBlood. Sometimes I missed Bill an awful lot.  
  
  I gave myself a mental shake. Snapping out of a slump, that was what today was all about. No more worry! No more fear! Free and twenty-six! Working! House paid for! Money in the bank! These were all good, positive things.  
  
  The parking lot was full when I got to the bar. I could see I'd be busy tonight. I drove around back to the employees' entrance. Sam Merlotte, the owner and my boss, lived back there in a very nice double-wide that even had a little yard surrounded by a hedge, Sam's equivalent of a white picket fence. I locked my car and went in the employees' back door, which opened into the hallway off of which lay the men's and the ladies', a large stock room, and Sam's office. I stowed my purse and coat in an empty desk drawer, pulled up my red socks, shook my head to make my hair hang right, and went through the doorway (this door was almost always propped open) that led to the big room of the bar/restaurant. Not that the kitchen produced anything but the most basic stuff: hamburgers, chicken strips, fries and onion rings, salads in the summer and chili in the winter.  
  
  Sam was the bartender, the bouncer, and on occasion the cook, but lately we'd been lucky in getting our positions filled: Sam's seasonal allergies had hit hard, making him less than ideal as a food handler. The new cook had shown up in answer to Sam's ad just the week before. Cooks didn't seem to stay long at Merlotte's, but I was hoping that Sweetie Des Arts would stick around a while. She showed up on time, did her job well, and never gave the rest of the staff any trouble. Really, that was all you could ask for. Our last cook, a guy, had given my friend Arlene a big rush of hope that he was The One - in this case, he'd have been her fourth or fifth One - before he'd decamped overnight with her plates and forks and a CD player. Her kids had been devastated; not because they'd loved the guy, but because they missed their CD player.  
  
  I walked into a wall of noise and cigarette smoke that made it seem like I was passing into another universe. Smokers all sit on the west side of the room, but the smoke doesn't seem to know it should stay there. I put a smile on my face and stepped behind the bar to give Sam a pat on the arm. After he expertly filled a glass with beer and slid it to a patron, he put another glass under the tap and began the process all over again.  
  
  ""How are things?"" Sam asked carefully. He knew all about Jason's problems, since he'd been with me the night I'd found Jason being held prisoner in a toolshed in Hotshot. But we had to be roundabout in our speech; vampires had gone public, but shape-shifters and Weres were still cloaked in secrecy. The underground world of supernatural beings was waiting to see how vampires fared before they followed the vampire example by going public.  
  
  ""Better than I expected. "" I smiled up at him, though not too far up, since Sam's not a big man. He's built lean, but he's much stronger than he looks. Sam is in his thirties - at least, I think he is - and he has reddish gold hair that halos his head. He's a good man, and a great boss. He's also a shape-shifter, so he can change into any animal. Most often, Sam turns into a very cute collie with a gorgeous coat. Sometimes he comes over to my place and I let him sleep on the rug in the living room. ""He's gonna be fine. ""  
  
  ""I'm glad,"" he said. I can't read shifter minds as easily as I read human minds, but I can tell if a mood is true or not. Sam was happy because I was happy.  
  
  ""When are you taking off?"" I asked. He had that faraway look in his eyes, the look that said he was mentally running through the woods, tracking possums.  
  
  ""As soon as Terry gets here. "" He smiled at me again, but this time the smile was a bit strained. Sam was getting antsy.  
  
  The door to the kitchen was just outside the bar area at the west end, and I stuck my head in the door to say hi to Sweetie. Sweetie was bony and brunette and fortyish, and she wore a lot of makeup for someone who was going to be out of sight in the kitchen all evening. She also seemed a little sharper, perhaps better educated, than any of Merlotte's previous short-order cooks.  
  
  ""You doing okay, Sookie?"" she called, flipping a hamburger as she spoke. Sweetie was in constant motion in the kitchen, and she didn't like anyone getting in her way. The teenager who assisted her and bussed tables was terrified of Sweetie, and he took care to dodge her as she moved from griddle to fryer. This teenage boy got the plates ready, made the salads, and went to the window to tell the barmaids which order was up. Out on the floor, Holly Cleary and her best friend, Danielle, were working hard. They'd both looked relieved when they'd seen me come in. Danielle worked the smoking section to the west, Holly usually worked the middle area in front of the bar, and I worked the east when three of us were on duty.  
  
  ""It looks like I better get moving,"" I told Sweetie.  
  
  She gave me a quick smile and turned back to the griddle. The cowed teenager, whose name I had yet to catch, gave me a ducked-head nod and went back to loading the dishwasher.  
  
  I wished Sam had called me before things had gotten so busy; I wouldn't have minded coming in a little earlier. Of course, he wasn't exactly himself tonight. I began checking the tables in my section, getting fresh drinks and clearing off food baskets, collecting money and bringing change.  
  
  ""Barmaid! Bring me a Red Stuff!"" The voice was unfamiliar, and the order was unusual. Red Stuff was the cheapest artificial blood, and only the newest vampires would be caught dead asking for it. I got a bottle from the clear-fronted refrigerator and stuck it in the microwave. While it warmed, I scanned the crowd for the vamp. He was sitting with my friend Tara Thornton. I'd never seen him before, which was worrisome. Tara'd been dating an older vampire (much older: Franklin Mott had been older than Tara in human years before he died, and he'd been a vampire for over three hundred years), and he'd been giving her lavish gifts - like a Camaro. What was she doing with this new guy? At least Franklin had nice manners.  
  
  I put the warm bottle on a tray and carried it over to the couple. The lighting in Merlotte's at night isn't particularly bright, which is how patrons like it, and it wasn't until I'd gotten quite near that I could appreciate Tara's companion. He was slim and narrow shouldered with slicked-back hair. He had long fingernails and a sharp face. I supposed that, in a way, he was attractive - if you like a liberal dose of danger with your sex.  
  
  I put the bottle down in front of him and glanced uncertainly at Tara. She looked great, as usual. Tara is tall, slim, and dark haired, and she has a wardrobe of wonderful clothes. She'd overcome a truly horrible childhood to own her own business and actually join the chamber of commerce. Then she start  
ed dating the wealthy vampire, Franklin Mott, and she quit sharing her life with me.  
  
  ""Sookie,"" she said, ""I want you to meet Franklin's friend Mickey. "" She didn't sound like she wanted us to meet. She sounded like she wished I'd never come over with Mickey's drink. Her own glass was almost empty, but she said, ""No,"" when I asked her if she was ready for another.  
  
  I exchanged a nod with the vampire; they don't shake hands, not normally. He was watching me as he took a gulp from the bottled blood, his eyes as cold and hostile as a snake's. If he was a friend of the ultra-urbane Franklin, I was a silk purse. Hired hand, more like. Maybe a bodyguard? Why would Franklin give Tara a bodyguard?  
  
  She obviously wasn't going to talk openly in front of this slimeball, so I said, ""Catch you later,"" and took Mickey's money to the till.  
  
  I was busy all night, but in the spare moments I had, I thought about my brother. For a second night, he was out frolicking under the moon with the other beasties. Sam had taken off like a shot the moment Terry Bellefleur arrived, though his office wastebasket was full of crumpled tissues. His face had been tense with anticipation.  
  
  It was one of those nights that made me wonder how the humans around me could be so oblivious to the other world operating right beside ours. Only willful ignorance could ignore the charge of magic in the air. Only a group lack of imagination could account for people not wondering what went on in the dark around them.  
  
  But not too long ago, I reminded myself, I'd been as willfully blind as any of the crowd in Merlotte's. Even when the vampires had made their carefully coordinated worldwide announcement that their existence was fact, few authorities or citizens seemed to take the next mental step: If vampires exist, what else could be lurking just outside the edge of the light?  
  
  Out of curiosity, I began to dip into the brains around me, testing to see their fears. Most of the people in the bar were thinking about Mickey. The women, and some of the men, were wondering what it would be like to be with him. Even stick-in-the-mud lawyer Portia Bellefleur was peeking around her conservative beau to study Mickey. I could only wonder at these speculations. Mickey was terrifying. That negated any physical attraction I might have felt toward him. But I had lots of evidence that the other humans in the bar didn't feel the same way.  
  
  I've been able to read minds all my life. The ability is no great gift. Most peoples' minds don't bear reading. Their thoughts are boring, disgusting, disillusioning, but very seldom amusing. At least Bill had helped me learn how to cut out some of the buzz. Before he'd given me some clues, it had been like tuning in to a hundred radio stations simultaneously. Some of them had come in crystal clear, some had been remote, and some, like the thoughts of shape-shifters, had been full of static and obscurity. But they'd all added up to cacophony. No wonder lots of people had treated me as a half-wit.  
  
  Vampires were silent. That was the great thing about vamps, at least from my point of view: They were dead. Their minds were dead, too. Only once in a coon's age did I get any kind of flash from a vampire mind.  
  
  Shirley Hunter, my brother's boss at his parish roadwork job, asked me where Jason was when I brought a pitcher of beer to his table. Shirley was universally known as ""Catfish. ""  
  
  ""Your guess is as good as mine,"" I said mendaciously, and he winked at me. The first guess as to where Jason was always involved a woman, and the second guess usually included another woman. The tableful of men, still in their working clothes, laughed more than the answer warranted, but then they'd had a lot of beer.  
  
  I raced back to the bar to get three bourbon-and-Cokes from Terry Bellefleur, Portia's cousin, who was working under pressure. Terry, a Vietnam vet with a lot of physical and emotional scars, appeared to be holding up well on this busy night. He liked simple jobs that required concentration. His graying auburn hair was pulled back in a ponytail and his face was intent as he plied the bottles. The drinks were ready in no time, and Terry smiled at me as I put them on my tray. A smile from Terry was a rare thing, and it warmed me.  
  
  Just as I was turning with my tray resting on my right hand, trouble erupted. A Louisiana Tech student from Ruston got into a one-on-one class war with Jeff LaBeff, a redneck who had many children and made a kind of living driving a garbage truck. Maybe it was just a case of two stubborn guys colliding and really didn't have much to do with town vs. gown (not that we were that close to Ruston). Whatever the reason for the original quarrel, it took me a few seconds to realize the fight was going to be more than a shouting match.  
  
  In those few seconds, Terry tried to intervene. Moving quickly, he got between Jeff and the student and caught firm hold of both their wrists. I thought for a minute it would work, but Terry wasn't as young or as active as he had been, and all hell broke loose.  
  
  ""You could stop this,"" I said furiously to Mickey as I hurried past his and Tara's table on my way to try to make peace.  
  
  He sat back in his chair and sipped his drink. ""Not my job,"" he said calmly.  
  
  I got that, but it didn't endear the vampire to me, especially when the student whirled and took a swing at me as I approached him from behind. He missed, and I hit him over the head with my tray. He staggered to one side, maybe bleeding a little, and Terry was able to subdue Jeff LaBeff, who was looking for an excuse to quit.  
  
  Incidents like this had been happening with more frequency, especially when Sam was gone. It was evident to me that we needed a bouncer, at least on weekend nights. . . and full-moon nights.  
  
  The student threatened to sue.  
  
  ""What's your name?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Mark Duffy,"" the young man said, clutching his head.  
  
  ""Mark, where you from?""  
  
  ""Minden. ""  
  
  I did a quick evaluation of his clothes, his demeanor, and the contents of his head. ""I'm gonna enjoy calling your mama and telling her you took a swing at a woman,"" I said. He blanched and said no more about suing, and he and his buds left soon after. It always helps to know the most effective threat.  
  
  We made Jeff leave, too.  
  
  Terry resumed his place behind the bar and began dispensing drinks, but he was limping slightly and had a strained look in his face, which worried me. Terry's war experiences hadn't left him real stable. I'd had enough trouble for one night.  
  
  But of course the night wasn't over yet.  
  
  About an hour after the fight, a woman came into Merlotte's. She was plain and plainly dressed in old jeans and a camo coat. She had on boots that had been wonderful when they'd been new, but that had been a long time ago. She didn't carry a purse, and she had her hands thrust into her pockets.  
  
  There were several indicators that made my mental antennae twitch. First of all, this gal didn't look right. A local woman might dress like that if she were going hunting or doing farm work, but not to come to Merlotte's. For an evening out at the bar, most women fixed themselves up. So this woman was in a working mode; but she wasn't a whore by the same reasoning.  
  
  That meant drugs.  
  
  To protect the bar in Sam's absence, I tuned in to her thoughts. People don't think in complete sentences, of course, and I'm smoothing it out, but what was running through her head was along the order of: Three vials left getting old losing power gotta sell it tonight so I can get back to Baton Rouge and buy some more. Vampire in the bar if he catches me with vamp blood I'm dead. This town is a dump. Back to the city first chance I get.  
  
  She was a Drainer, or maybe she was just a distributor. Vampire blood was the most intoxicating drug on the market, but of course vamps didn't give it up willingly. Draining a vampire was a hazardous occupation, boosting prices of the tiny vials of blood to amazing sums.  
  
  What did the drug user get for parting with a lot of money? Depending on the age of the blood - that is, the time since it'd been removed from its owner - and the age of the vampire from whom the blood had been removed, and the individual chemistry of the drug user, it could be quite a lot. There was the feeling of omnipotence, the increased strengt  
h, acute vision, and hearing. And most important of all for Americans, an enhanced physical appearance.  
  
  Still, only an idiot would drink black-market vampire blood. For one thing, the results were notoriously unpredictable. Not only did the effects vary, but those effects could last anywhere from two weeks to two months. For another thing, some people simply went mad when the blood hit their system - sometimes homicidally mad. I'd heard of dealers who sold gullible users pig's blood or contaminated human blood. But the most important reason to avoid the black market in vamp blood was this: Vampires hated Drainers, and they hated the users of the drained blood (commonly known as bloodheads). You just don't want a vampire pissed off at you.  
  
  There weren't any off-duty police officers in Merlotte's that night. Sam was out wagging his tail somewhere. I hated to tip off Terry, because I didn't know how he'd react. I had to do something about this woman.  
  
  Truly, I try not to intervene in events when my only connection comes through my telepathy. If I stuck my oar in every time I learned something that would affect the lives around me (like knowing the parish clerk was embezzling, or that one of the local detectives took bribes), I wouldn't be able to live in Bon Temps, and it was my home. But I couldn't permit this scraggy woman to sell her poison in Sam's bar.  
  
  She perched on an empty barstool and ordered a beer from Terry. His gaze lingered on her. Terry, too, realized something was wrong about the stranger.  
  
  I came to pick up my next order and stood by her. She needed a bath, and she'd been in a house heated by a wood fireplace. I made myself touch her, which always improved my reception. Where was the blood? It was in her coat pocket. Good.  
  
  Without further ado, I dumped a glass of wine down her front.  
  
  ""Dammit!"" she said, jumping off the stool and patting ineffectually at her chest. ""You are the clumsiest-ass woman I ever saw!""  
  
  "" 'Scuse me,"" I said abjectly, putting my tray on the bar and meeting Terry's eyes briefly. ""Let me put some soda on that. "" Without waiting for her permission, I pulled her coat down her arms. By the time she understood what I was doing and began to struggle, I had taken charge of the coat. I tossed it over the bar to Terry. ""Put some soda on that, please,"" I said. ""Make sure the stuff in her pockets didn't get wet, too. "" I'd used this ploy before. I was lucky it was cold weather and she'd had the stuff in her coat, not in her jeans pocket. That would have taxed my inventiveness.  
  
  Under the coat, the woman was wearing a very old Dallas Cowboys T-shirt. She began shivering, and I wondered if she'd been sampling more conventional drugs. Terry made a show of patting soda on the wine stain. Following my hint, he delved into the pockets. He looked down at his hand with disgust, and I heard a clink as he threw the vials in the trash can behind the bar. He returned everything else to her pockets.  
  
  She'd opened her mouth to shriek at Terry when she realized she really couldn't. Terry stared directly at her, daring her to mention the blood. The people around us watched with interest. They knew something was up, but not what, because the whole thing had gone down very quickly. When Terry was sure she wasn't going to start yelling, he handed me the coat. As I held it so she could slide her arms in, Terry told her, ""Don't you come back here no more. ""  
  
  If we kept throwing people out at this rate, we wouldn't have many customers.  
  
  ""You redneck son of a bitch,"" she said. The crowd around us drew in a collective breath. (Terry was almost as unpredictable as a bloodhead. )  
  
  ""Doesn't matter to me what you call me,"" he said. ""I guess an insult from you is no insult at all. You just stay away. "" I expelled a long breath of relief.  
  
  She shoved her way through the crowd. Everyone in the room marked her progress toward the door, even Mickey the vampire. In fact, he was doing something with a device in his hands. It looked like one of those cell phones that can take a picture. I wondered to whom he was sending it. I wondered if she'd make it home.  
  
  Terry pointedly didn't ask how I'd known the scruffy woman had something illegal in her pockets. That was another weird thing about the people of Bon Temps. The rumors about me had been floating around as long as I could remember, from when I was little and my folks put me through the mental health battery. And yet, despite the evidence at their disposal, almost everyone I knew would much rather regard me as a dim and peculiar young woman than acknowledge my strange ability. Of course, I was careful not to stick it in their faces. And I kept my mouth shut.  
  
  Anyway, Terry had his own demons to fight. Terry subsisted on some kind of government pension, and he cleaned Merlotte's early in the morning, along with a couple of other businesses. He stood in for Sam three or four times a month. The rest of his time was his own, and no one seemed to know what he did with it. Dealing with people exhausted Terry, and nights like tonight were simply not good for him.  
  
  It was lucky he wasn't in Merlotte's the next night, when all hell broke loose.

Chapter 2  
  
  2  
  
  AT FIRST, I thought everything had returned to normal. The bar seemed a little calmer the next night. Sam was back in place, relaxed and cheerful. Nothing seemed to rile him, and when I told him what had happened with the dealer the night before, he complimented me on my finesse.  
  
  Tara didn't come in, so I couldn't ask her about Mickey. But was it really any of my business? Probably not my business - but my concern, definitely.  
  
  Jeff LaBeff was back and sheepish about getting riled by the college kid the night before. Sam had learned about the incident thr ough a phone call fr om Terry, and he gave Jeff a word of warning.  
  
  Andy Bellefleur, a detective on the Renard parish force and Portia's brother, came in with the young woman he was dating, Halleigh Robinson. Andy was older than me, and I'm twenty-six. Halleigh was twenty-one - just old enoughto be in Merlotte's. Halleigh taught at the elementary school, she was right out of college, and she was real attractive, with short earlobe-length brown hair and huge brown eyes and a nicely rounded figure. Andy had been dating Halleigh for about two months, and from the little I saw of the couple, they seemed to be progressing in their relationship at a predictable rate.  
  
  Andy's true thoughts were that he liked Halleigh very much (though she was a tad boring), and he was really ready for her to give it up. Halleigh thought Andy was sexy and a real man of the world, and she really loved the newly restored Bellefleur family mansion, but she didn't believe he'd hang around long after she slept with him. I hate knowing more about relationships than the people in them know - but no matter how battened down I am, I pick up a trickle of stuff.  
  
  Claudine came in the bar that night, toward closing time. Claudine is six feet tall, with black hair that ripples down her back and bruised-looking white skin that looks thin and glossy like a plum's. Claudine dresses for attention. Tonight she was wearing a terra-cotta pants suit, cut very snug on her Amazonian body. She works in the complaint department of a big store at the mall in Ruston during the day. I wished she'd brought her brother, Claude, with her. He doesn't swing in my direction, but he's a treat for the eyes.  
  
  He's a fairy. I mean, literally. So's Claudine, of course.  
  
  She waved at me across the heads of the crowd. I waved back smiling. Everyone's happy around Claudine, who is always cheerful when there are no vampires in her vicinity. Claudine is unpredictable and a lot of fun, though like all fairies, she's as dangerous as a tiger when she's angry. Fortunately, that doesn't happen often.  
  
  Fairies occupy a special place in the hierarchy of magical creatures. I haven't figured out exactly what it is yet, but sooner or later I'll piece it together.  
  
  Every man in the bar was drooling over Claudine, and she was eating it up. She gave Andy Bellefleur a long, bigeyed look, and Halleigh Robinson glared, mad enough to spit, until she remembered she was a sweet southern girl. But Claudine abandoned all interest in Andy when she saw he was drinking ice tea with lemon. Fairies are even more violently allergic to lemon than vampires are to garlic.  
  
  Claudine worked her way over to me, and she gave me a big hug, to the envy of every male in the bar. She took my hand to pull me into Sam's office. I went with her out of sheer curiosity.  
  
  ""Dear friend,"" Claudine said, ""I have bad news for you. ""  
  
  ""What?"" I'd gone from bemused to scared in a heartbeat.  
  
  ""There was a shooting early this morning. One of the werepanthers was hit. ""  
  
  ""Oh, no! Jason!"" But surely one of his friends would've called if he hadn't gone into work today?  
  
  ""No, your brother is fine, Sookie. But Calvin Norris was shot. ""  
  
  I was stunned. Jason hadn't called to tell me this? I had to find out from someone else?  
  
  ""Shot dead?"" I asked, hearing my voice shake. Not that Calvin and I were close - far from it - but I was shocked. Heather Kinman, a teenager, had been fatally shot the week before. What was happening in Bon Temps?  
  
  ""Shot in the chest. He's alive, but he's bad hurt. ""  
  
  ""Is he in the hospital?""  
  
  ""Yes, his nieces took him to Grainger Memorial. ""  
  
  Grainger was a town farther southeast than Hotshot, and a shorter drive from there than the parish hospital in Clarice.  
  
  ""Who did it?""  
  
  ""No one knows. Someone shot him early this morning, when Calvin was on his way to work. He'd come home from his, um, time of the month, changed, and started into town for his shift. "" Calvin worked at Norcross.  
  
  ""How'd you come to know all this?""  
  
  ""One of his cousins came into the store to buy some pajamas, since Calvin didn't have any. Guess he sleeps in the buff,"" Claudette said. ""I don't know how they think they're going to get a pajama top on over the bandages. Maybe they just needed the pants? Calvin wouldn't like to be shuffling around the hospital with only one of those nasty gowns between him and the world. ""  
  
  Claudine often took long side trails in her conversation.  
  
  ""Thanks for telling me,"" I said. I wondered how the cousin had known Claudine, but I wasn't going to ask.  
  
  ""That's okay. I knew you'd want to know. Heather Kinman was a shape-shifter, too. Bet you didn't know that. Think about it. ""  
  
  Claudine gave me a kiss on the forehead - fairies are very touchy-feely - and we went back into the bar area. She'd stunned me into silence. Claudine herself was back to business as usual. The fairy ordered a 7-and-7 and was surrounded by suitors in about two minutes flat. She never left with anyone, but the men seemed to enjoy trying. I'd decided that Claudine fed off this admiration and attention.  
  
  Even Sam was beaming at her, and she didn't tip.  
  
  By the time we were closing the bar, Claudine had left to go back to Monroe, and I'd passed along her news to Sam. He was as appalled by the story as I was. Though Calvin Norris was the leader of the small shifter community of Hotshot, the rest of the world knew him as a steady, quiet bachelor who owned his own home and had a good job as crew foreman at the local lumber mill. It was hard to imagine either of his personas leading to an assassination attempt. Sam decided to send some flowers from the bar's staff.  
  
  I pulled on my coat and went out the bar's back door just ahead of Sam. I heard him locking the door behind me. Suddenly I remembered that we were getting low on bottled blood, and I turned to tell Sam this. He caught my movement and stopped, waiting for me to speak, his face expectant. In the length of time it takes to blink, his expression changed from expectant to shocked, dark red began to spread on his left leg, and I heard the sound of a shot.  
  Then blood was everywhere, Sam crumpled to the ground, and I began to scream.

1lo2aud,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lo2aud,Alpino Peanut Protein & Nutrabox Soy Protein. Newer Trustified Certified Options for Lactose Intolerant Folks !,"

This is not exactly a review. It's a moderately enthusiastic ramble. 

I'm lactose intolerant… extremely intolerant. I have tried all wheys mentioned as ""lactose free"".... along with several other isolates like Isopure and Dymatize ISO 100. Nothing sits well in my gut. Even pea protein makes me bloated. Luckily I have learned to rely on raw food like chicken, egg, fish etc to reach my daily 130–140 gms of protein. 

However there are days when you just need the convenience of a quick protein shake. For that, I use Soy protein (Nakpro, Asitis) or Rice Protein (Asitis). They are unappealing in taste, but I don't really give a shit. Now that trustified has given the green signal to NUTRABOX's Soy Protein, I went ahead and placed an order, it's yet to arrive. But what has gotten me excited is the arrival of a new contender in the game… The peanut protein isolate! Afaik two brands are available for that one, one is ALPINO's. The other is NUTRABOX's. The Alpino one is trustified certified (Aflatoxin was my primary concern). I have already tried the chocolate flavoured one, it doesn't have the usual chalkiness of a plant protein 🫡.  I am yet to try their Kesar Mango 🤔 and Coffee flavors. If anyone has tried pls do share your opinion. And of course there's Nutrabox's peanut isolate too, which perhaps will be trustified certified too... hopefully... eventually. So long story short, times are changing for us lactose intolerant folks, or for those who simply wanna avoid dairy. We have options now. ✌️ Rant over. Gotta go. I got things to do. 

TLDR: Happy to finally see a trustified certified Peanut Protein Isolate and a Soy Protein Isolate.

I’m in the early stages of starting a cafe in Mumbai, something that blends good coffee, good food, but with a chill space where you can either work quietly or just unwind (that includes community building activities over the weekends).

Think of it as a coffee + co-working crossover, without the dead co-working space vibe. (yeah, I know, everyone and their dog is starting a café but I believe we can do something special here; of course only with input from the real café going crowd.)

Before I lock anything in, I really want to understand what people actually want from cafes here, not what Instagram tells us is pretty and aesthetic.

So if you’ve ever had a strong opinion about your coffee (or the lack of good ones), whether in Mumbai or otherwise, would love to hear more from you.

1.	What kind of coffee do you actually enjoy drinking? (Be as descriptive as you’d like; pictures are welcome too!)

2.	Do you think most cafés in India do coffee well? Or is it mostly vibes > taste? Or is it more dependent on the food?

3.	What makes you go back to a café? On the flip side, what turns you off about a café?

4.	Do you prefer quick takeaway coffee or sit-down places?

5.	What’s your sweet spot for a well priced coffee? How much do you think a good coffee should cost?

6.	Bonus: If you’ve ever worked out of a café, what would make that easier? (wifi, seating, silence, music, outlets?)

Any thoughts, rants, or even “pls don’t make another banana bread café” comments are welcome.

My DMs are also open if anyone’s interested in talking further, might even have something special for you (when the café is finally up and running lol). 

Thanks to anyone who read this, you’re a sweetheart.",9,1751272081.0,mumbai,12,0.91,False

- Work itself was fine, I got bits done. 
- I met mum for lunch which was nice though I felt awkward for some reason. I got eggs, a hash thing and spinach and a coffee and it was delightful.
- I made a mistake with work, well I missed something. I felt like such a failure and disappointment. It was caught in time, but I still missed it. And now I’m wondering if I missed more things and I can’t shake the thought. 
- I left to go home at six
- I had to try really hard to not cry on the bus home. I felt overcome with sadness, nothing triggered it as such I just felt so.. worthless, ugly and a waste of space. I think being called out earlier obviously played a part but I think it’s just been an off day in general, I’m pre-period so things hit harder and I’m just someone prone to not being happy so it just is what it is. 

My bed is really comfy. 

I don’t feel good. I feel like there is zero point in me even being here. It’s just a blip. It’s fine. I just feel so… I just feel like I’m taking up space I don’t deserve and letting everyone in my life down just by existing, let alone every time I fail at things.

Not going to do a preachy bit about the environment or stealing, or soul too, just sharing the idea. It's been argued to death here and I'm not gonna throw a hat into a ring over it. On top of that I think this post would be great to break up the ""lolz antis bad!!1!!!!1"" posts being spammed here. Frankly I'm proud of where I've come from and how I communicate these ideas without AI in any step of the way. Provided with the post are some sketches I did for the project.

So in short, it's gonna be focused on two college roommates, doing day to day life stuff in some made up town in Oregon. Thematically, it's along the lines of Bee and Puppycat, and my favorite anime Cowboy Bebop. I'm heavily into magic and nature, as well as the mix-ups that get thrown around our lives, and getting some serious direction from other shows I have seen (notably Over the Garden Wall and the Fionna and Cake series). This project has been rattling around in my head for years, and I'm now at the state where I would be comfortable going for more ambitious goals. Since it focuses on nature, my own characters, and ideas, it means a ton to me when I draw new reference sheets for characters, or explore places again with the same wonder I had as a kid going to National Parks. In my project file I described it (project's style) as ""Cottage core piss lighting"" as a vibe to shoot for. AI would get me the piss lighting but not much else honestly.

As for the relation to AI in this discussion, 

Do I know what it is capable of? 
> Yes, very much so. AI could do it all for me in a handful of minutes, but I believe it wouldn't get my ideas or feelings the way I want. Meat computers are better in the regard of feeling shit like chemicals that go funky. I'll pass on the shortcut.

Why is this related to the subreddit? 
> If we can see the billions of posts just dunking on one group of people, I feel like a well written ""I don't like it"" post wouldn't hurt. We already see AI achievements here, why not human achievements? 

Where can I find more art of this project?
> Nowhere really, I'm bad at painting digitally, so background art would have to go a whole other way to get finished. Also I've seen what some of y'all did with LavenderTowne and I'm lowkey scared of getting that treatment too. (Yeah she asked for it, but the current top posts/posters here ain't doing you guys favors).

How long have you been drawing?
> took an art class in grades 6-8, and stopped. Got way into animation around the pandemic, then hopped back into drawing about 5 years ago to animate beyond stick figures. 

How much money is your stuff?
> $30 for a perma-license of CSP, and a $150 drawing tablet, both from over 4 years ago. The physical stuff is on a cheap $5 walmart sketchbook, I get good mileage off of solid mechanical pencils and cheap art pens. So before you assume, no, I'm not a rich person doing a victory lap. I'm a regular joe-shmoe who isn't named joe.

Anyway, I have a script for a demo written, and I've been meaning to finish storyboards. If anyone is interested in that let me know. 

We focus too much on the ""war"" part of the subreddit, but why can't we have a Christmas truce every now and then? It's about time we see some actual solid posts from both sides here, and not the same 5 people saying ""antis bad and stupid and they want you dead, laugh at them.""",28,1751271623.0,aiwars,41,0.85,False

No drink in the pilots' lounge, no dinner, not even a bath when he got back to Westwood. He intended to fall into bed and sleep for fourteen hours.  
  
  American Pride's Flight 7--Flagship Service from Tokyo to Los Angeles--had been delayed first by strong headwinds and then by typical congestion at LAX ... which was, Engle thought, arguably America  
's worst airport, if you left out Logan in Boston. To make matters worse, a pressurization problem had developed during the latter part of the flight. Minor at first, it had gradually worsened until it was scary. It had almost gotten to the point where a blowout and explosive decompression could have occurred ... and had mercifully grown no worse. Sometimes such problems suddenly and mysteriously stabilized themselves, and that was what had happened this time. The passengers now disembarking just behind the control cabin had not the slightest idea how close they had come to being people pate on tonight's flight from Tokyo, but Brian knew ... and it had given him a whammer of a headache.  
  
  ""This bitch goes right into diagnostic from here,"" he told his co-pilot. ""They know it's coming and what the problem is, right?""  
  
  The co-pilot nodded. ""They don't like it, but they know.""  
  
  ""I don't give a shit what they like and what they don't like, Danny. We came close tonight.""  
  
  Danny Keene nodded. He knew they had.  
  
  Brian sighed and rubbed a hand up and down the back of his neck. His head ached like a bad tooth. ""Maybe I'm getting too old for this business.""  
  
  That was, of course, the sort of thing anyone said about his job from time to time, particularly at the end of a bad shift, and Brian knew damned well he wasn't too old for the job--at forty-three, he was just entering prime time for airline pilots. Nevertheless, tonight he almost believed it. God, he was tired.  
  
  There was a knock at the compartment door; Steve Searles, the navigator, turned in his seat and opened it without standing up. A man in a green American Pride blazer was standing there. He looked like a gate agent, but Brian knew he wasn't. It was John (or maybe it was James) Deegan, Deputy Chief of Operations for American Pride at LAX.  
  
  ""Captain Engle?""  
  
  ""Yes?"" An internal set of defenses went up, and his headache flared. His first thought, born not of logic but of strain and weariness, was that they were going to try and pin responsibility for the leaky aircraft on him. Paranoid, of course, but he was in a paranoid frame of mind.  
  
  ""I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, Captain.""  
  
  ""Is this about the leak?"" Brian's voice was too sharp, and a few of the disembarking passengers glanced around, but it was too late to do anything about that now.  
  
  Deegan was shaking his head. ""It's your wife, Captain Engle.""  
  
  For a moment Brian didn't have the foggiest notion what the man was talking about and could only sit there, gaping at him and feeling exquisitely stupid. Then the penny dropped. He meant Anne, of course.  
  
  ""She's my ex-wife. We were divorced eighteen months ago. What about her?""  
  
  ""There's been an accident,"" Deegan said. ""Perhaps you'd better come up to the office.""  
  
  Brian looked at him curiously. After the last three long, tense hours, all of this seemed strangely unreal. He resisted an urge to tell Deegan that if this was some sort of Candid Camera bullshit, he could go fuck himself. But of course it wasn't. Airlines brass weren't into pranks and games, especially at the expense of pilots who had just come very close to having nasty midair mishaps.  
  
  ""What about Anne?"" Brian heard himself asking again, this time in a softer voice. He was aware that his co-pilot was looking at him with cautious sympathy. ""Is she all right?""  
  
  Deegan looked down at his shiny shoes and Brian knew that the news was very bad indeed, that Anne was a lot more than not all right. Knew, but found it impossible to believe. Anne was only thirty-four, healthy, and careful in her habits. He had also thought on more than one occasion that she was the only completely sane driver in the city of Boston ... perhaps in the whole state of Massachusetts.  
  
  Now he heard himself asking something else, and it was really like that--as if some stranger had stepped into his brain and was using his mouth as a loudspeaker. ""Is she dead?""  
  
  John or James Deegan looked around, as if for support, but there was only a single flight attendant standing by the hatch, wishing the deplaning passengers a pleasant evening in Los Angeles and glancing anxiously toward the cockpit every now and then, probably worried about the same thing that had crossed Brian's mind--that the crew was for some reason to be blamed for the slow leak which had made the last few hours of the flight such a nightmare. Deegan was on his own. He looked at Brian again and nodded. ""Yes--I'm afraid she is. Would you come with me, Captain Engle?""  
  
  2  
  
  At quarter past midnight, Brian Engle was settling into seat 5A of American Pride's Flight 29--Flagship Service from Los Angeles to Boston. In fifteen minutes or so, that flight known to transcontinental travelers as the red-eye would be airborne. He remembered thinking earlier that if LAX wasn't the most dangerous commercial airport in America, then Logan was. Through the most unpleasant of coincidences, he would now have a chance to experience both places within an eight-hour span of time: into LAX as the pilot, into Logan as a deadheading passenger.  
  
  His headache, now a good deal worse than it had been upon landing Flight 7, stepped up another notch.  
  
  A fire, he thought. A goddamned fire. What happened to the smoke-detectors, for Christ's sake? It was a brand-new building!  
  
  It occurred to him that he had hardly thought about Anne at all for the last four or five months. During the first year of the divorce, she was all he had thought about, it seemed--what she was doing, what she was wearing, and, of course, who she was seeing. When the healing finally began, it had happened very fast ... as if he had been injected with some spirit-reviving antibiotic. He had read enough about divorce to know what that reviving agent usually was: not an antibiotic but another woman. The rebound effect, in other words.  
  
  There had been no other woman for Brian--at least not yet. A few dates and one cautious sexual encounter (he had come to believe that all sexual encounters outside of marriage in the Age of AIDS were cautious), but no other woman. He had simply ... healed.  
  
  Brian watched his fellow passengers come aboard. A young woman with blonde hair was walking with a little girl in dark glasses. The little girl's hand was on the blonde's elbow. The woman murmured to her charge, the girl looked immediately toward the sound of her voice, and Brian understood she was blind--it was something in the gesture of the head. Funny, he thought, how such small gestures could tell so much.  
  
  Anne, he thought. Shouldn't you be thinking about Anne?  
  
  But his tired mind kept trying to slip away from the subject of Anne--Anne, who had been his wife, Anne, who was the only woman he had ever struck in anger, Anne who was now dead.  
  
  He supposed he could go on a lecture tour; he would talk to groups of divorced men. Hell, divorced women as well, for that matter. His subject would be divorce and the art of forgetfulness.  
  
  Shortly after the fourth anniversary is the optimum time for divorce, he would tell them. Take my case. I spent the following year in purgatory, wondering just how much of it was my fault and how much was hers, wondering how right or wrong it was to keep pushing her on the subject of kids--that was the big thing with us, nothing dramatic like drugs or adultery, just the old kids-versus-career thing--and then it was like there was an express elevator inside my head, and Anne was in it, and down it went.  
  
  Yes. Down it had gone. And for the last several months, he hadn't really thought of Anne at all ... not even when the monthly alimony check was due. It was a very reasonable, very civilized amount; Anne had been making eighty thousand a year on her own before taxes. His lawyer paid it, and it was just another item on the monthly statement Brian got, a little two-thousand-dollar item tucked between the electricity bill and the mortgage payment on the condo.  
  
  He watched a gangly teenaged boy with a violin case under his arm and a yarmulke on his head walk down the aisle. The boy looked both nervous and excited, his eyes full of the future. Brian envied him.  
  
  There had been a lot of bitterness and anger between the two of them during the last year of the marriage, and finally, about four months before the end, it had happened: his hand had said go before his brain could say no. He didn't like to remember that. She'd had too much to drink at  
a party, and she had really torn into him when they got home.  
  
  Leave me alone about it, Brian. Just leave me alone. No more talk about kids. If you want a sperm-test, go to a doctor. My job is advertising, not baby-making. I'm so tired of all your macho bullshit--  
  
  That was when he had slapped her, hard, across the mouth. The blow had clipped the last word off with brutal neatness. They had stood looking at each other in the apartment where she would later die, both of them more shocked and frightened than they would ever admit (except maybe now, sitting here in seat 5A and watching Flight 29's passengers come on board, he was admitting it, finally admitting it to himself). She had touched her mouth, which had started to bleed. She held out her fingers toward him.  
  
  You hit me, she said. It was not anger in her voice but wonder. He had an idea it might have been the first time anyone had ever laid an angry hand upon any part of Anne Quinlan Engle's body.  
  
  Yes, he had said. You bet. And I'll do it again if you don't shut up. You're not going to whip me with that tongue of yours anymore, sweetheart. You better put a padlock on it. I'm telling you for your own good. Those days are over. If you want something to kick around the house, buy a dog.  
  
  The marriage had crutched along for another few months, but it had really ended in that moment when Brian's palm made brisk contact with the side of Anne's mouth. He had been provoked--God knew he had been provoked--but he still would have given a great deal to take that one wretched second back.  
  
  As the last passengers began to trickle on board, he found himself also thinking, almost obsessively, about Anne's perfume. He could recall its fragrance exactly, but not the name. What had it been? Lissome? Lithesome? Lithium, for God's sake? It danced just beyond his grasp. It was maddening.  
  
  I miss her, he thought dully. Now that she's gone forever, I miss her. Isn't that amazing?

  Lawnboy? Something stupid like that?  
  
  Oh stop it, he told his weary mind. Put a cork in it.  
  
  Okay, his mind agreed. No problem; I can quit. I can quit anytime I want. Was it maybe Lifebuoy? No--that's soap. Sorry. Lovebite? Lovelorn?  
  
  Brian snapped his seatbelt shut, leaned back, closed his eyes, and smelled a perfume he could not quite name.  
  
  That was when the flight attendant spoke to him. Of course: Brian Engle had a theory that they were taught-in a highly secret post-graduate course, perhaps called Teasing the Geese--to wait until the passenger closed his or her eyes before offering some not-quite-essential service. And, of course, they were to wait until they were reasonably sure the passenger was asleep before waking him to ask if he would like a blanket or a pillow.  
  
  ""Pardon me ..."" she began, then stopped. Brian saw her eyes go from the epaulets on the shoulders of his black jacket to the hat, with its meaningless squiggle of scrambled eggs, on the empty seat beside him.  
  
  She rethought herself and started again.  
  
  ""Pardon me, Captain, would you like coffee or orange juice?"" Brian was faintly amused to see he had flustered her a little. She gestured toward the table at the front of the compartment, just below the small rectangular movie screen. There were two ice-buckets on the table. The slender green neck of a wine bottle poked out of each. ""Of course, I also have champagne.""  
  
  Engle considered  
  
  (Love Boy that's not it close but no cigar)  
  
  the champagne, but only briefly. ""Nothing, thanks,"" he said. ""And no in-flight service. I think I'll sleep all the way to Boston. How's the weather look?""  
  
  ""Clouds at 20,000 feet from the Great Plains all the way to Boston, but no problem. We'll be at thirty-six. Oh, and we've had reports of the aurora borealis over the Mojave Desert. You might want to stay awake for that.""  
  
  Brian raised his eyebrows. ""You're kidding. The aurora borealis over California? And at this time of year?""  
  
  ""That's what we've been told.""  
  
  ""Somebody's been taking too many cheap drugs,"" Brian said, and she laughed. ""I think I'll just snooze, thanks.""  
  
  ""Very good, Captain."" She hesitated a moment longer. ""You're the captain who just lost his wife, aren't you?""  
  
  The headache pulsed and snarled, but he made himself smile. This woman--who was really no more than a girl--meant no harm. ""She was my ex-wife, but otherwise, yes. I am.""  
  
  ""I'm awfully sorry for your loss.""  
  
  ""Thank you.""  
  
  ""Have I flown with you before, sir?""  
  
  His smile reappeared briefly. ""I don't think so. I've been on overseas for the past four years or so."" And because it seemed somehow necessary, he offered his hand. ""Brian Engle.""  
  
  She took it. ""Melanie Trevor.""  
  
  Engle smiled at her again, then leaned back and closed his eyes once more. He let himself drift, but not sleep--the pre-flight announcements, followed by the take-off roll, would only wake him up again. There would be time enough to sleep when they were in the air.  
  
  Flight 29, like most red-eye flights, left promptly--Brian reflected that was high on their meager list of attractions. The plane was a 767, a little over half full. There were half a dozen other passengers in first class. None of them looked drunk or rowdy to Brian. That was good. Maybe he really would sleep all the way to Boston.  
  
  He watched Melanie Trevor patiently as she pointed out the exit doors, demonstrated how to use the little gold cup if there was a pressure loss (a procedure Brian had been reviewing in his own mind, and with some urgency, not long ago), and how to inflate the life vest under the seat. When the plane was airborne, she came by his seat and asked him again if she could get him something to drink. Brian shook his head, thanked her, then pushed the button which caused his seat to recline. He closed his eyes and promptly fell asleep.  
  
  He never saw Melanie Trevor again.  
  
  3  
  
  About three hours after Flight 29 took off, a little girl named Dinah Bellman woke up and asked her Aunt Vicky if she could have a drink of water.  
  
  Aunt Vicky did not answer, so Dinah asked again. When there was still no answer, she reached over to touch her aunt's shoulder, but she was already quite sure that her hand would touch nothing but the back of an empty seat, and that was what happened. Dr. Feldman had told her that children who were blind from birth often developed a high sensitivity--almost a kind of radar--to the presence or absence of people in their immediate area, but Dinah hadn't really needed the information. She knew it was true. It didn't always work, but it usually did ... especially if the person in question was her Sighted Person.  
  
  Well, she's gone to the bathroom and she'll be right back, Dinah thought, but she felt an odd, vague disquiet settle over her just the same. She hadn't come awake all at once; it had been a slow process, like a diver kicking her way to the surface of a lake. If Aunt Vicky, who had the window seat, had brushed by her to get to the aisle in the last two or three minutes, Dinah should have felt her.  
  
  So she went sooner, she told herself. Probably she had to Number Two--it's really no big deal, Dinah. Or maybe she stopped to talk with somebody on her way back.  
  
  Except Dinah couldn't hear anyone talking in the big airplane's main cabin; only the steady soft drone of the jet engines. Her feeling of disquiet grew.  
  
  The voice of Miss Lee, her therapist (except Dinah always thought of her as her blind teacher), spoke up in her head: You mustn't be afraid to be afraid, Dinah-all children are afraid from time to time, especially in situations that are new to them. That goes double for children who are blind. Believe me, I know. And Dinah did believe her, because, like Dinah herself, Miss Lee had been blind since birth. Don't give up your fear ... but don't give in to it, either. Sit still and try to reason things out. You'll be surprised how often it works.  
  
  Especially in situations that are new to them.  
  
  Well, that certainly fit; this was the first time Dinah had ever flown in anything, let alone coast to coast in a huge transcontinental jetliner.  
  
  Try to reason it out.  
  
  Well, she had awakened in a strange place to find her Sighted Person gone. Of course that was scary, even if you knew the absence was only temporary--after all, your Sighted Person couldn't very well decide to pop off to the nearest Taco Bell because she had the munchies when she was shut up in an airplane flying at 37,000 feet. As for the strange silence in the cabin ... well, this was the red-eye, after all. The other passengers were probably sleeping.  
  
  All of them? the worried part of her mind asked doubtfully. ALL of them are sleeping? Can that be?  
  
  Then the answer came to her: the movie. The ones who were awake were watching the in-flight movie. Of course.  
  
  A sense of almost palpable relief swept over her. Aunt Vicky had told her the movie was Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally ... , and said she planned to watch it herself ... if she could stay awake, that was.  
  
  Dinah ran her hand lightly over her aunt's seat, feeling for her headphones, but they weren't there. Her fingers touched a paperback book instead. One of the romance novels Aunt Vicky liked to read, no doubt--tales of the days when men were men and women weren't, she called them.  
  
  Dinah's fingers went a little further and happened on something else--smooth, fine-grained leather. A moment later she felt a zipper, and a moment after that she felt the strap.  
  
  It was Aunt Vicky's purse.  
  
  Dinah's disquiet returned. The earphones weren't on Aunt Vicky's seat, but her purse was. All the traveller's checks, except for a twenty tucked deep into Dinah's own purse, were in there--Dinah knew, because she had heard Mom and Aunt Vicky discussing them before they left the house in Pasadena.  
  
  Would Aunt Vicky go off to the bathroom and leave her purse on the seat? Would she do that when her travelling companion was not only ten, not only asleep, but blind?  
  
  Dinah didn't think so.  
  
  Don't give up your fear ... but don't give in to it, either. Sit still and try to reason things out.  
  
  But she didn't like that empty seat, and  
she didn't like the silence of the plane. It made perfect sense to her that most of the people would be asleep, and that the ones who were awake would be keeping as quiet as possible out of consideration for the rest, but she still didn't like it. An animal, one with extremely sharp teeth and claws, awakened and started to snarl inside of her head. She knew the name of that animal; it was panic, and if she didn't control it fast, she might do something which would embarrass both her and Aunt Vicky.  
  
  When I can see, when the doctors in Boston fix my eyes, I won't have to go through stupid stuff like this.  
  
  This was undoubtedly true, but it was absolutely no help to her right now.  
  
  Dinah suddenly remembered that, after they sat down, Aunt Vicky had taken her hand, folded all the fingers but the pointer under, and then guided that one finger to the side of her seat. The controls were there--only a few of them, simple, easy to remember. There were two little wheels you could use once you put on the headphones--one switched around to the different audio channels; the other controlled the volume. The small rectangular switch controlled the light over her seat. You won't need that one, Aunt Vicky said with a smile in her voice. At least, not yet. The last one was a square button--when you pushed that one, a flight attendant came.  
  
  Dinah's finger touched this button now, and skated over its slightly convex surface.  
  
  Do you really want to do this? she asked herself, and the answer came back at once. Yeah, I do.  
  
  She pushed the button and heard the soft chime. Then she waited.  
  
  No one came.  
  
  There was only the soft, seemingly eternal whisper of the jet engines. No one spoke. No one laughed (Guess that movie isn't as funny as Aunt Vicky thought it would be, Dinah thought). No one coughed. The seat beside her, Aunt Vicky's seat, was still empty, and no flight attendant bent over her in a comforting little envelope of perfume and shampoo and faint smells of make-up to ask Dinah if she could get her something--a snack, or maybe that drink of water.  
  
  Only the steady soft drone of the jet engines.  
  
  The panic animal was yammering louder than ever. To combat it, Dinah concentrated on focussing that radar gadget, making it into a kind of invisible cane she could jab out from her seat here in the middle of the main cabin. She was good at that; at times, when she concentrated very hard, she almost believed she could see through the eyes of others. If she thought about it hard enough, wanted to hard enough. Once she had told Miss Lee about this feeling, and Miss Lee's response had been uncharacteristically sharp. Sight-sharing is a frequent fantasy of the blind, she'd said. Particularly of blind children. Don't ever make the mistake of relying on that feeling, Dinah, or you're apt to find yourself in traction after falling down a flight of stairs or stepping in front of a car.  
  
  So she had put aside her efforts to ""sight-share,"" as Miss Lee had called it, and on the few occasions when the sensation stole over her again--that she was seeing the world, shadowy, wavery, but there--through her mother's eyes or Aunt Vicky's eyes, she had tried to get rid of it ... as a person who fears he is losing his mind will try to block out the murmur of phantom voices. But now she was afraid and so she felt for others, sensed for others, and did not find them.  
  
  Now the terror was very large in her, the yammering of the panic animal very loud. She felt a cry building up in her throat and clamped her teeth against it. Because it would not come out as a cry, or a yell; if she let it out, it would exit her mouth as a fireball scream.  
  
  I won't scream, she told herself fiercely. I won't scream and embarrass Aunt Vicky. I won't scream and wake up all the ones who are asleep and scare all the ones who are awake and they'll all come running and say look at the scared little girl, look at the scared little blind girl.  
  
  But now that radar sense--that part of her which evaluated all sorts of vague sensory input and which sometimes did seem to see through the eyes of others (no matter what Miss Lee said)--was adding to her fear rather than alleviating it.  
  
  Because that sense was telling her there was nobody within its circle of effectiveness.  
  
  Nobody at all.  
  
  4  
  
  Brian Engle was having a very bad dream. In it, he was once again piloting Flight 7 from Tokyo to L.A., but this time the leak was much worse. There was a palpable feeling of doom in the cockpit; Steve Searles was weeping as he ate a Danish pastry.  
  
  If you're so upset, how come you're eating? Brian asked. A shrill, teakettle whistling had begun to fill the cockpit--the sound of the pressure leak, he reckoned. This was silly, of course--leaks were almost always silent until the blowout occurred--but he supposed in dreams anything was possible.  
  
  Because I love these things, and I'm never going to get to eat another one, Steve said, sobbing harder than ever.  
  
  Then, suddenly, the shrill whistling sound stopped. A smiling, relieved flight attendant--it was, in fact, Melanie Trevor--appeared to tell him the leak had been found and plugged. Brian got up and followed her through the plane to the main cabin, where Anne Quinlan Engle, his ex-wife, was standing in a little alcove from which the seats had been removed. Written over the window beside her was the cryptic and somehow ominous phrase SHOOTING STARS ONLY. It was written in red, the color of danger.  
  
  Anne was dressed in the dark-green uniform of an American Pride flight attendant, which was strange--she was an advertising executive with a Boston agency, and had always looked down her narrow, aristocratic nose at the stews with whom her husband flew. Her hand was pressed against a crack in the fuselage.  
  
  See, darling? she said proudly. It's all taken care of. It doesn't even matter that you hit me. I have forgiven you.  
  
  Don't do that, Anne! he cried, but it was already too late. A fold appeared in the back of her hand, mimicking the shape of the crack in the fuselage. It grew deeper as the pressure differential sucked her hand relentlessly outward. Her middle finger went through first, then the ring finger, then the first finger and her pinky. There was a brisk popping sound, like a champagne cork being drawn by an overeager waiter, as her entire hand was pulled through the crack in the airplane.  
  
  Yet Anne went on smiling.  
  
  It's L'Envoi, darling, she said as her arm began to disappear. Her hair was escaping the clip which held it back and blowing around her face in a misty cloud. It's what I've always worn, don't you remember?  
  
  He did ... now he did. But now it didn't matter.  
  
  Anne, come back! he screamed.  
  
  She went on smiling as her arm was sucked slowly into the emptiness outside the plane. It doesn't hurt at all, Brian-believe me.  
  
  The sleeve of her green American Pride blazer began to flutter, and Brian saw that her flesh was being pulled out through the crack in a thickish white ooze. It looked like Elmer's Glue.  
  
  L'Envoi, remember? Anne asked as she was sucked out through the crack, and now Brian could hear it again--that sound which the poet James Dickey once called ""the vast beast-whistle of space."" It grew steadily louder as the dream darkened, and at the same time it began to broaden. To become not the scream of wind but that of a human voice.  
  
  Brian's eyes snapped open. He was disoriented by the power of the dream for a moment, but only a moment--he was a professional in a high-risk, high-responsibility job, a job where one of the absolute prerequisites was fast reaction time. He was on Flight 29, not Flight 7, not Tokyo to Los Angeles but Los Angeles to Boston, where Anne was already dead--not the victim of a pressure leak but of a fire in her Atlantic Avenue condominium near the waterfront. But the sound was still there.  
  
  It was a little girl, screaming shrilly.  
  
  5  
  
  ""Would somebody speak to me, please?"" Dinah Bellman asked in a low, clear voice. ""I'm sorry, but my aunt is gone and I'm blind.""  
  
  No one answered her. Forty rows and two partitions forward, Captain Brian Engle was dreaming that his navigator was weeping and eating a Danish pastry.  
  
  There was only the continuing drone of the jet engines.  
  
  The panic overshadowed her mind again, and Dinah did the only thing she could think of to st  
ave it off: she unbuckled her seatbelt, stood up, and edged into the aisle.  
  
  ""Hello?"" she asked in a louder voice. ""Hello, anybody!""  
  
  There was still no answer. Dinah began to cry. She held onto herself grimly, nonetheless, and began walking forward slowly along the portside aisle. Keep count, though, part of her mind warned frantically. Keep count of how many rows you pass, or you'll get lost and never find your way back again.  
  
  She stopped at the row of portside seats just ahead of the row in which she and Aunt Vicky had been sitting and bent, arms outstretched, fingers splayed. She was steeled to touch the sleeping face of the man sitting there. She knew there was a man here, because Aunt Vicky had spoken to him only a minute or so before the plane took off. When he spoke back to her, his voice had come from the seat directly in front of Dinah's own. She knew that; marking the locations of voices was part of her life, an ordinary fact of existence like breathing. The sleeping man would jump when her outstretched fingers touched him, but Dinah was beyond caring.  
  
  Except the seat was empty.  
  
  Completely empty.  
  
  Dinah straightened up again, her cheeks wet, her head pounding with fright. They couldn't be in the bathroom together, could they? Of course not.  
  
  Perhaps there were two bathrooms. In a plane this big there must be two bathrooms.  
  
  Except that didn't matter, either.  
  
  Aunt Vicky wouldn't have left her purse, no matter what. Dinah was sure of it.  
  
  She began to walk slowly forward, stopping at each row of seats, reaching into the two closest her first on the port side and then on the starboard.  
  
  She felt another purse in one, what felt like a briefcase in another, a pen and a pad of paper in a third. In two others she felt headphones. She touched something sticky on an earpiece of the second set. She rubbed her fingers together, then grimaced and wiped them on the mat which covered the headrest of the seat. That had been earwax. She was sure of it. It had its own unmistakable, yucky texture.  
  
  Dinah Bellman felt her slow way up the aisle, no longer taking pains to be gentle in her investigations. It didn't matter. She poked no eye, pinched no cheek, pulled no hair.
