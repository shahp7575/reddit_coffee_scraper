1g0uj54,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1g0uj54/they_watch_they_come_they_disappear/,"They Watch, They Come, They Disappear ","I had always been an observer. A true people-watcher.

It started innocently enough--an interest in someone I barely knew. His name was Daniel, a quiet man who lived in the apartment block across the street. I watched him from my window, silently noting the small things: the way he walked to the corner store, the clothes he wore, the brief conversations he sometimes had with strangers. Each detail felt like a thread weaving an impossibly boring story. Yet, somehow, it was fascinating.

At first, it was harmless. I told myself I was just curious, but the more I watched, the more I felt drawn to him. I would follow him, lingering outside the coffee shop where he spent an hour every Friday morning. I listened to him laugh as he chatted with the passersby. I collected fragments of his life like trophies. It was thrilling. He was a puzzle I wanted to solve.

One evening, I worked up the nerve to knock on his door. He answered, surprise flickering across his face. I stammered through an introduction, briefly twisting the truth of how I’d ended up there, and he invited me in, a cautious smile on his lips.

His apartment was filled with books, a cozy chaos that matched him perfectly. We talked for hours—about literature, art, dreams. I felt an electric connection, a bond deeper than I’d ever experienced. Yet, I noticed something off in his eyes. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on.

Days turned into weeks, and our encounters became more frequent, but there was an underlying tension between us—an unspoken distance. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was aware of my obsession. One night, after I lingered too long outside his apartment, he walked outside and confronted me.

“You’re not the first to come to my door, you know,"" he said, almost sadly. “They always come, just like you.”

“What? What do you mean?” I asked, the paranoia in my eyes crystal clear. My heart began beating faster.

“This isn’t a coincidence,"" he said, walking slowly toward me. ""It’s… a cycle.”

""Wha-what are you t-t-talking about, Daniel? I d-don't understand."" My voice was starting to shake.

""They watch, they come, they disappear... Every, single, one."" He took another step closer, and my panic meter peaked. I turned and ran.

I bolted for the door with a speed I never knew I had and didn’t stop until I was a few streets away, completely breathless. I glanced over my shoulder and saw no one. Nothing. I was safe.

Suddenly, I saw a familiar haze of a figure just ahead. The closer I got, the more I couldn't believe my eyes.

""Mom?! What—what are you doing here?! You're—you're dead!""

""I know, my darling,"" she said, smiling. And it hit me.

""Who was that man? Did he… did he kill me?""

""No, my darling, he's an angel of death. He just doesn't know it. None of them do.""

1g0ucak,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g0ucak/im_in_love_with_my_babys_mom_but_she_wants_to/,"I’m in love with my baby’s mom, but she wants to leave.","So I (27M) met Mila (25F) like 4 years ago at a bar. Long story short, it was a mutual friend’s birthday, we were at this bar, and we had both just gotten out of long-term relationships. Hers was 5 years, mine was 4. A LOT of drinking later, it was hella awkward waking up naked on the birthday dude's couch with Mila. But honestly, that wasn’t even the wildest thing that happened that night. The birthday guy? He did something WAY worse.

Anyway, after all that, me and Mila were both super awkward about it. She legit looked like she wanted to crawl under a rock. Neither of us wanted anything serious since we had just broken up with our exes, but we still swapped numbers and went our separate ways.

Fast forward like 3 months, Mila texted me up asking to grab coffee. I thought it was kinda weird, but I figured she might wanna go on a date or something. When I got there, she looked like she’d been crying. As soon as I sat down, she just started bawling. Turns out, she was pregnant. She hadn’t realized cause she was super stressed and tired, but I was the only person she’d slept with. My whole life flipped upside down. We did a DNA test,  and it was mine.  Then she moved in with me cause she was sharing a room with a roommate. The guest room became hers, and my office is now Andreas room, but we call him Andy. 

Having a kid wasn’t exactly in my plans, but since Andy came along, my life’s been better, honestly. Over the years, me and Mila never really had a romantic relationship, except for this one time she kissed me after Andy was born. We get along, I support them, I’m paying for Mila’s grad school (she finishes next year), we split the chores, and I’m always there for whatever she needs.

So, in November, Andy’s gonna turn 3. We’ve been planning his birthday, it's around Halloween, so he and his friends are all gonna dress up. He wants to go as Bingo from Bluey. During one of our talks, Mila asked if I wanted her to move out. She said now that Andy’s 3, we could co-parent separately, and I could even, like, get a girlfriend if I wanted to. I just went blank and said “no” and dipped to my room.

Here’s the thing: I love her. Having Andy is everything to me, but I’m also legit in love with her. She’s smart, beautiful, caring, thoughtful, kind, dedicated, she’s literally the most perfect person ever. But I’m way too scared to tell her. We have a kid together, and I’m terrified of ruining everything between us as parents and friends. I don’t know if I should tell her how I feel or just keep pretending everything’s fine so I don’t mess up what we have.",2,1728597373.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

I’ve used them for a number of jobs and they do decent enough work. Today, it was a crew of two and they showed up midday to get started. A few minutes into them being at my place one of the workers came to the door and asked if I would make them two coffees. I was sort of caught off guard because I was busy doing a bunch of chores inside and didn’t expect them to be asking me for drinks, but said sure and asked if they take cream and sugar. They wanted one with cream and sugar and one without. I went back in and brewed them coffee and brought it to them. They said thanks and then proceeded to sit around for 15 minutes and drink it. 

I was pretty annoyed by the exchange and have decided to not hire them back. I feel like an asshole for being annoyed because it was just a cup of coffee and HAD I’d offered to get them a drink it wouldn’t be a big deal. But it’s weird, right? Who just shows up after being hired to do a small job and then asked the customer to make them a drink and proceeded to sit and relax while they drink it. It sort of feels like I was in the opening of a Curb Your Enthusiasm Episode.

I *completely* understand that strive is a very different game in general, and I'm not vouching for all the old mechanics to come back for every character, buuuut...

I think some characters kind of benefitted from the moveset revamp, while some hurt. Not in terms of power level, but moreso character identity.

For example I think Axl is the best he's ever been in Strive, and even after playing XRD I don't really miss his sparrowhawk stance, and timestop was a great addition.

However, take 1 look at Chipp's gameplay from XX/XRD compared to strive, and he feels (mechanically) like he swapped from doing crack cocaine to a good cup of coffee in the morning.

One night I looked up the instagram to see if there were any drink specials and instead I saw a reel featuring this cute employee i saw once in passing. Later that week I saw this employee again and it was like this instant connection. He stared at me the entire time I was in there and made the most intense eye contact i’ve ever had with anyone. It was like the closest feeling to love at first sight. My friend was with me and she witnessed it all and was like “oh my god what?!?” so then over the course of the next month I went in a lot more and the staring and eye contact continued but I didn’t even know his name but I was developing feelings without really knowing him, just one of those instant things (I had never experienced this before). Then one night I finally did an instagram deep dive and found out his name and such but also that he had a girlfriend so I mourned the idea of that but was fine going in and letting whatever happens happen. Then he was really off for a week and me and my friend both had this gut feeling him and his girlfriend broke up. His instagram is private and I don’t follow it but the posts went from 27 to 24. And also he started actually kind of flirting with me (remembering my name without me ever telling him, just typing it in), light teasing, still lots of eye contact and staring lmao) He seems really shy. Then last Monday he was in the middle of a task and I was looking at food and he turned around and started a conversation with me out of the blue. Again he’s super shy and doesn’t talk a lot and not a typical flirty barista. So I felt like this meant something. And the conversation was super unnecessary he had to turn around and get my attention to ask “Did i catch you on your way to work this morning?” Anyway so now fast forward to this week I’m feeling pretty confident that a) they broke up and b) that he likes me so i decided to request to follow him on instagram. and he rejects it. I’m very confused by this behavior and i’m scared to go in again because i don’t want to make him uncomfortable or myself feel worse. He really was showing all signs of interest but this feels not right. Any opinions, takes, or advice?? ",1,1728596798.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

“... and it was terrifying, but I mean... we have a huge family home now and we all have good jobs. I mean... he’s a sorcerer! One that’s pissed with US! That normally means you’re going to die screaming and if you run you die tired too. But... I don’t know... things aren’t adding up.” Bellia’Barlis is a very active woman who speaks with more than just words, she speaks with her entire body and is going into borderline gymnastic routines with her explanations.

  
  


Which was weird as most Apuk would only gesture a little with their hands if they did so at all, and none of the other Barlis spoke in this way. Observer Wu was forced to assume that he had the... good and bad fortune to be speaking to one of the more expressive family members.

  
  


Good in that she’s really getting the point across, bad in that it was a lot of energy to be bringing into a conversation and he felt like his coffee might have had too much kick to it. And unfortunetly telling the nearly hyper woman to calm down would taint the interview, leaving him with a bad data set.

  
  


“And how did this change your opinion on humanity? Did you have one before this?”

  
  


“Honestly I thought humans were a tight piece of ass and that’s all before.”

  
  


“Really?”

  
  


“Oh yeah! A species with a ton of men, that can eat anything and are not only really enduring but loving? Woo!” She exclaims before sighing. “But so far you’re like the only one on Serbow that isn’t married to some really scary ladies, really scary or a sorcerer, which is really scary by default so... I haven’t gotten my piece of the pie yet... hmm... meat pie... is there any left over?”

  
  


“Ma’am, just a few more quick questions and I’ll leave you alone.”

  
  


“Oh don’t do that! I like having men around! Makes me feel more like a woman.” Bellia’Barlis says with a hand to her chest. “A pity you’re heading back into cruel space when this is all over, a bit of rejuve, maybe some more flattering clothes... pair of fake horns and a tail... maybe a biograph to get them on... You’d be damn cute with some effort.”

  
  


“Genetically modifying myself, ‘some’ effort. Right.”

  
  


“Hey hey hey! Biographs are easier than gene mods. A quick surgery and they go on or off.”

  
  


“Biographs are that easy?”

  
  


“Yeah, but they’re not to popular in the galaxy right now. Some people use them, most don’t.”

  
  


“Could one use them to say take on traits similar to humans? Null resistance and the like?”

  
  


“I suppose, but... well... human woman don’t look too good.”

  
  


“What do you mean?”

  
  


“When you have parts of another race grafted on then you look like them right?”

  
  


“Right, that sounds reasonable.”

  
  


“Well, think about it. Human women don’t have Axiom to keep them looking good nad healthy. I’ve seen a few images of unmodified human woman... They don’t have any real bounce and their hair looks dead and they need makeup to look like there’s any life in them. I mean really, with women like that it’s a shock that humans actually survived as a species long enough to make it out of cruel space.”

  
  


“...Right, and is this a common sentiment?” He asks slowly.

  
  


“You’re looking for all points of view? Well this is the locker room gossip! Human women are the luckiest ugly bitches in the galaxy!”

  
  


“You do realize that without the smaller breasts and rears that human women would live a life of suffering and agony within cruel space I hope.”

  
  


“No pain no gain!”

  
  


“Or rather plenty of pain and no gain, Earth is not kind to people that ignore physics and basic cause and effect.” Observer Wu remarks.

  
  


“Eh... well the pictures of the few girls from out of your patch of the galaxy really doesn’t flatter them. If they’re not plain, ugly or sick looking then they look like the most pissed off or unimpressed people imaginable. So if they’re not too ugly to screw, then the main issue would be finding one that isn’t too frigid to have fun with.” Bellia’Barlis says with a big grin on her face.

  
  


“Well this interview is going to piss off more than a few people.”

  
  


“Happy to help human!” She says with a cheeky smile. “I’ll bet everyone’s all gushing and glowing about how great humans have been, but me? I’m going to have some fun with it! I mean really! How much does Earth have to be full of raging bitches that men are litereally running a galaxy away to get some distance before relaxing!?”

  
  


“And how did you come to THAT conclusion?”

  
  


“How did I come to that conclusion? I’ll tell you how I came to that conclusion! Basic logic! How is it that your species fielded an ENTIRE ARMY of unattached men!? Unless your species has a disgusting mortality rate, then the even gender split should mean that logically no one should be unattached! Everyone should have someone! But no! We have armies of young men at their most handsome, energetic and capable, alone! With no one! And girls have been noticing! Most think of it as a ‘their loss’ situation, but we’ve been noticing! The Bloody Prophet may be scary, but a man that knows what he loves in life and is so ready to love and be in love should have had someone long before he became who he is today! To say nothing of every other soldier! Or your Admiral! I mean really?! One of the most famous, rich and well to do men on an entire world gets screwed over by his only wife!? What are you DOING on Earth!?”

  
  


“Things are a bit more complicated than that...”

  
  


“Oh sure the things that lead up to something can be complicated, but the idea of an entire world of men is not only out there but they’re showing signs of outright abuse as well? Bad sign. Very bad sign.”

  
  


“It’s not abuse, it’s more complicated.”

  
  


“I’m sure. I’m sure there are a thousand reasons for every thousand reasons for everything I’ve listed. But you’re asking about what I think, not what I know. I think I see a lot of badly abused men, what I know is that things are more complicated. But complicated doesn’t mean things look any better. You want an opinion? Here’s a low down, right at the ground level opinion, if not for the Null, there would be a rescue operation to get human men away from human women.”

  
  


“You must be joking.”

  
  


“Maybe I am, maybe I’m not. But the question is, is it a possibility Earth can ignore?” Bellia’Barlis asks with a smirk.

  
  


“So there’s a negative public opinion on the women of Earth?”

  
  


“Oh yes, and I’m going to be paying attention after this. After all, seeing how those girls flail around in response to this kind of thing is going to be fun.”

  
  


“Is this some kind of round about revenge on Vernon?”

  
  


“Only kinda. It’s also true which means I can just dodge behind that. Apparently he respects honesty.” Bellia’Barlis says before shrugging more with her left side than her right, but still shrugging her whole body. Somehow. The woman is damn expressive.

  
  


“And you get revenge.”

  
  


“I’d want more if the last call from my nieces and nephews wasn’t about all the cool things they were doing or how Battle Princesses were showing them how to fight and even helping with schoolwork. Apparently they’re all at least a year ahead of where her public education would bring em and...”

  
  


“You have very mixed feelings about things.”

  
  


“Of course I do! I want the best for the little firestarters, but I want them here! Every morning where we don’t trip over them or get in a fight over the fried meat strips is a bad one! But they... they’re doing better there. Even with the fucking Harkul, they’re doing better...” She explains as she goes still and just stares into the distance, her look halfway between rage and sorrow. Then she sighs heavily enough that sparks fly out and seems to reinflate herself.

  
  


“How about a slight change of topic, you’ve made your thoughts on what humans on earth are like clear, and what humans on Serbow and even Centris are like, but have you heard of other batches of humans and what they’ve been up to?”

  
  


“Oh! I did hear that a group of them tamed a bunch of pirates and took over some world right on the edge of Wild Space! They’re like dukes and Barons and all sorts of things now!”

  
  


“Ah yes, those guys.”

  
  


“So you know who I’m talking about?”

  
  


“I do, I’ve spoken with them a bit. But this isn’t about what I know, it’s about what you know. So what have you heard about them...”

  
  


“Well...”

“Soben’Ryd? Not the furthest or most exotic Apuk Colony world. But definitely one that most tourists and such avoid. A trip there beyond standard trade grabs attention.” Hayle’Ghuran notes from where she’s comfortably lounging next to her husband. She was in a state that most would call, fabulously dishevelled. Most girls had to work to look this good when they pried themselves off the furniture, but being well heeled and well fucked helped so very, very much.

  
  


Clearing the air between yourself and your family before coming together in wholesome, and carnal with the husband and sister wives, ways really took all the stress off a woman. Made her easily look her best. Happy and healthy is attractive, imagine that.

  
  


“Yes, apparently The Empress detects trouble and wants to put the planet on notice. In her own way.” Hart’Ghuran answers.

  
  


“Oh? How’s she going to do that? Get into all the trade contracts so that she can nullify them and starve the planet of vital resources? Put a Battle Princess in each guard force and precinct house as ‘reinforcements’ that are also blatant spies and threats?” Vanth’Ghuran asks.

  
  


“Maybe, but her opening move is to take a peek in while Morg’Arqun tries to grow another extension of The Dark Forest like he did on Lilb’Tulelb. And she’s going to use me as transport. It’s the repayment for her recent help, and also putting me in the hot seat as her clear patsy. Which is both reward as people will want to make trade deals with Ghuran as a whole if I’m in good with her, and bad as those who move against her, even subconsciously will slot me into the enemy category.”

  
  


“... Could you repeat what you just said after the fact that there’s apparently a second Dark Forest on Lilb’Tulelb?! And that a third is going to be grown on Soben’Ryd?!” Yira’Ghuran asks in shock.

  
  


“Don’t worry about it, what else is happening is entirely secondary to the fact that The Dark Forest is reproducing.”

  
  


“So are we going to get another unnaturally dark forest of lush trees, bushes and vines growing on Soben’Ryd? Where will get the water? Or the fertile soil for that matter?” Yira’Ghuran presses in shock.

  
  


“The Bright Forest on Lilb’Tulelb is apparently a mushroom forest.” Hart’Ghuran says and there’s a pause.

  
  


“Really?”

  
  


“A phosphorescent mushroom forest at that. So it glows in the dark and is under a rainstorm that lasts half a year at least.”

  
  


“Oh... that’s... odd. Wait, do is the next one going to be like... I don’t know a giant forest of cacti who’s spines can spear spaceships? Will it be a seaweed forest on a watery world? A coral one? Will it be in the crops of a farming world? The drugs of a world famous for them? The hell kind of nightmare would it be if it starts reproducing on worlds that are already covered in insanely dangerous plants and animals?”

  
  


“Well, seeing as how it can reasoned with and has a long history of adopting young boys in need, well I’m not seeing much of a downside.”

  
  


“You’re a boy, of course you’re not.”

  
  


“The Dark Forest, by it’s past actions wants to be unharmed and wants it’s sons who are extensions of itself to also be unharmed. The only thing that’s unreasonable about it is the fact that it will take retroactive offence and injury if it adopts a new son and it uses lethal force nearly every single time. Beyond that... it’s perfectly capable of being reasoned with. Up to and including being given citizenship status which... which... Oh! Oh the clever witch...”

  
  


“Clever witch what do you... wait. Wait she’s setting a precedent up. A legal precedent that means she can effectively land grab on a galactic scale with The Dark Forest’s help. Or rather... with the help of The Dark Forest Species. If the first of the species is a Serbow citizen, then so are all it’s children and their children’s children’s children. By inheritance laws any place a new Dark Forest sprouts would count as further Serbow territory since the terrain is now a citizen. With legally recognized precedent.” Hayle’Ghuran says as her eyes widen before she goes crosseyed and shakes her head. “Why and how is it that every single time I look at her plans I find more and more and more moves in advance?”

  
  


“Because The Empress is scary good at what she does and the only reason she’s not a primal is likely because the attention it would bring to her would make her less effective.” Yari’Ghuran notes.

  
  


“You know... I can actually see her saying that being a Goddess would be too much more to do on top of being Empress. Or it somehow not being fair to the competition... or that it would discourage her potential rivals from revealing themselves and goddess knows how many other things.” Hart’Ghuran moans... then pauses and chuckles.

I am looking for a bakery where I can buy a 75th birthday cake for my Dad as everything I am finding online doesn't meet my requirements which are: 

Flavours: either a fruit cake or coffee and walnut

Decoration: personalised message. Not too much buttercream if possible

Area: I could pick up from near kings cross or Paddington stations or I could get my sister to pick it up from somewhere near Streatham hill/ west Norwood.

To serve 12. We'll need to pick the cake up the day before it's being served and transport it via train. 

I'm also interested to hear how much you'd expect to pay for a cake like this as the ones I've seen have been more than I expected (but I will pay it for this occasion, just don't want to fork out way more than is reasonable). 

Thank you for any recommendations!

So I have mental issues and I'm not sure how to get helpful therapy in this country, I started going to hospital for few months when I suffered badly and I didn't feel like getting better, the medicine they gave me made me feel very fatigued that's the only change happened about me so I went to a private psychiatrist thinking he might be more helpful and he wasn't.

Not only I had to wait many hours for him and actually took my session at 2am, He was sleepy more than me and barely sad anything helpful, He simply gave me a prescription for another medicine, I didn't like this so I didn't buy the medicine and never went back to him.

I went to another one who made me feel like I'm seeing a nutritionist, He basically ignored the events that led me to this mental state and simply told me to stop drinking coffee, soda, orange juice, lemon juice, not eat strawberries, spicy food and ironically he was fine with Tea, he told me also to walk for half hour and sing to myself a song, he also gave a bottle of a fish's liver oil to drink and ofcourse a medicine, I tried following his advice but I didn't get better, I felt worse.

It's been few months now since the last time I went to a psychiatrist, I went to them before a lot of times and I never got better, I spent a lot of money and I'm poor so spending that money hurts, I still feel very terrible and still have suicidal thoughts and suffer from a lot of things like OCD. I felt that the hospital was actually little bit better than both private psychiatrists but still didn't help me enough.

So I'm not sure what to do now, I have a strong feeling that I should just give up and let myself sink in my misery but I also feel at the same time that I should just find the right therapist who could really help me, I'm not sure if I even deserve help since I'm kind of stable now, Like if you see me now you might think that I'm fine, I feel that psychiatrists only care about severe cases like autism, Also I feel that I can never change myself so I'm not sure, Anyways, What I want to know is am I right to think that those psychiatrists are simply bad and I just need to find a good one ? Are all therapists and psychiatrists the same ? Do I have to follow them blindly ? Am I eligible to be treated by a therapist ?",1,1728596573.0,Tunisia,2,1.0,False

Though it may exist, I didn’t find it so decided to write my own. This is just the opening to setup the story. Do not read if you haven’t finished GG and AYITL. 

……………….


I’m Lorelai Lee Gilmore, I come from a long line of Lorelai’s. My grandma wanted me to be Lorelai III because if guys can do it, why can’t women. But mom didn’t want to be a JR, thankfully. Guess I could have been the IV since my great-great-grandmother is also a Lorelai. I heard she was a force, shouldn’t surprise me though since mom and grandma are also a force of their own. Grandpa Luke struggled to keep up with the two of them. He says I’m his savior, providing fresh air from the craziness. I think sometimes he likes that we moved away from Stars Hollow four years ago. Their food bill and coffee usage has definitely gone down. That is one habit I inherited, my love of coffee. Grandpa Luke and Grandma are always arguing over the proper amount of coffee. When mom was pregnant with me, he even tried to change them to decaf, it didn’t end well. He should have realized they’d taste and smell the difference. I probably would have gotten disowned if I took up tea like grandpa. Having lived in London the past 4 years, would have been easy to happen. But being back in Connecticut, probably a good idea I stuck with coffee, tea isn’t as good here. Yeah, we just moved back to town. Mom wants me to attend her alma mater, says it would be good to me, sadly I’m not talking about Stars Hollow High.

The mod u/NutellaFilledCelery had verified the post but is no longer active and did not leave any proof of its validity.

This is an open discussion as well, feel free to comment anything but do remember that assertions must have some evidence, no baseless claims.

> Q: Are you aware of the discussion about you on reddit related to Lake City Quiet Pills?
> 
> 
> A: I tried my hand at web hosting for small local businesses without much success for several years. I met a guy named Oscar who hired me to host an image website. That's as far as I was involved. I had a dedicated IP and he had a server he wanted online. He paid $50 (cash) a month. When they left he sold me their server which I immediately re-sold to someone (a young lady whose name I can't remember) from a forum. After paying Oscar for the server I never heard from him again.
> 
> I was in the military (Navy (aviation maintenance)).
> 
> I never met the Milo guy or anyone else.

Debunk: ""I tried my hand - for several years."" Crystalwind.com was used to host local businesses of Montclair, NJ and NY from 1996-2000. During 2000, most of the local businesses pages had either been removed or changed to the DK Morgan quote. 9/11/2001 happened, and then Crystalwind.com page changed again but to a [black background with red text targeting the perpetrators of 9/11](https://web.archive.org/web/20010923123504/http://crystalwind.com/). He was not looking for new customers to host small local businesses anymore.

""I met a guy named Oscar who hired me to host an image website. That's as far as I was involved. I had a dedicated IP and he had a server he wanted online. He paid $50 (cash) a month."" So Oscar/shade was the one who hired Mike to host the image site and not Milo? And if $50/month is to be believed, no wonder he had little success hosting, back in those days that was a steal. For context, Mike had a Verizon business class connection (most likely the fastest speeds possible 20 years ago), which would have ran $500+/month. But this is a bold face lie, LakeCityQuietPills.com was registered in October of 2001, right after 9.11. So they wanted to start hosting images for a porn site (DSF) that didn't exist for another 3-4 years, and that hadn't had their non-existant public image base destroyed? It was an email server before it became a web server, as made evident by angel-two-six@lakecityquietpills.com being used to sign up on Fark exactly 1 month after 9.11.

""When they left he sold me their server"" They left where? If ""they"" are real, shade/Oscar sold it to Mike, to run the image host after they started insurgences.net. ""which I immediately re-sold to someone (a young lady whose name I can't remember) from a forum.""
No, it took about a month for Miss MadamMeow to get the same Verizon business class internet setup in her home, she talked on [DSF about all the trouble and strife she went through with the install guys at the time](https://imgur.com/a/WVOFwvA). And using context clues, it seems like she had access to the 2-6 email address as well.

""I was in the military (Navy (aviation maintenance))."" Weird flex of a half-truth to the question of how he knew what LCQP was in reference to. Mike was definitely in the military ([FPO address verified](https://imgur.com/a/XPsV9GC)), and the 9.11 page with the Naval ship image pretty much confirms Navy background.  ""I never met the Milo guy,"" does not line up with the story. [2-6 was the one providing webhosting for Milo](https://np.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/928so/the_end_of_religionofpeace_he_died_today/), not shade/Oscar, 2-6 said he found Milo dead. u/lcqp also claims [his boss died at his computer](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31r1s6/what_would_it_feel_like_to_die_of_old_age/cq45gl9/).

> Q: Did you host lcqp from 2001 to 2010?
> 
> 
> A: I don't know how long they owned that domain. But I know that I didn't host it for 9+ years. Lake City was something I added to my server where CWC lived.

Debunk: Lakecityquietpills.com was registered through crystalwind.com Sept/Oct 2001 and [follows closely with the DNS records of crystalwind.com all the way to the same dynamic DNS provider over a decade later. IP addresses match as well.](https://imgur.com/a/u7msi7p) LC could've been hosted on the same server as CWC, but this detail of LC being added to his server where CWC lived doesn't line up with the answer to the following question.

> Q: Did you get to know him at all over that period, or anything strike you as interesting about him? Did you deal much face to face?
> 
> 
> A: I met Oscar at Best Buy. I was looking for a new PC for my kid and he was looking for a PC and asked me if I knew about computers. When I said a bit, he asked if I thought any of the PCs there were okay to run a webserver. Things went forward from that. I met him once after that to get his server (I don't know who set it up) and once for coffee a while before he shutdown. Otherwise, it was cash in an envelope mailed to me every month I never dealt with anyone else at LC except by email. 3-4 different people emailed as angel 26 when there were server issues they couldn't fix remotely or when they'd crashed the image host software

Debunk: ""I met Oscar at Best Buy."" If Oscar/shade is real, they most definitely didn't meet at Best Buy. Given his past military experience, more likely at an airshow and the with the relation to Lake City Army Ammunition Plant and the name Lake City Quiet Pills right after 9.11 it only solidifies the idea that the original purpose was not for image hosting back in 2001. Mike had to have admin level access to the server supposedly set up by someone else since others were emailing him to fix issues they couldn't fix remotely or when they crashed the server by overloading the image host, which goes against what he claimed earlier that he had no real involvement.

> Q: What indicated that there were multiple Angel 26's?
> 
> 
> A: The first 26 sometimes signed as Jero, another one as Bishop. Jero didn't write well (grammer/spelling/phrasing). Bishop and Pierce (Pearce?) could both write well enough, but one was very terse and had no sense of humor and the other was pretty wordy. There was another 26, too. But I only knew about him because Shade told me he was new. A week later, he was replaced (no emails from him). 

Debunk: The list of 2-6's goes as follows: Jerro Mank (Milo), JP4, Bishop Streicher (Bishop), Pierce Tip (Pierce), Kim Maxxon (dustoff). All of them posted on DSF at some point during their tenure as 2-6.

> Q: Were you aware of the hidden message board on LCQP?
> 
> 
> A: I never looked at the image host except to upload images, check log files, restart it, or when the ISP shut down the connection after they received an offensive image report. There were some other reports, but most people reported them with the TOS violation email address. It was definitely not a kiddie porn site. They didn't like hate stuff or gore, either, and amended the TOS boilerplate to state as much.
> 
> I went to reddit and read about the buried information after you emailed. I don't think I'd have hidden anything on a public page that way, but they weren't techie. Anything you don't want anyone to see really needs to be behind some sort of autho system. 

Debunk: As their webhost, wouldn't Mike have been the one they talked to about doing some sort of autho system? Following the ""leak of hidden info"" on reddit, they encrypted it using a PGP key, but Mike also went on to [host](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2011-August/000024.html) on [TOR](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2011-August/000023.html), trying to mirror a site; which site? He doesn't say. So maybe they did speak of it and this is all a lie? JP4 seems to be Mike as he posted on the TOS on DSF.

> Q: What do you think of the term Lake City Quiet Pills? 
> 
> 
> A: I'd heard of lake city while I was in the service (my last unit had a lot of active hunters/competitive shooters).  

Debunk: He claims to have heard of Lake City Army Ammo Plant from when he was in the service, but doesn't explain how it connects to the image host. This further cements the fact that LakeCityQuietPills.com was created for another reason entirely before being used as a web host.

> Q: Are you the Flink user on goodreads/flink@crystalwinds.com?
> 
> 
> A: That flink account was mine, but that was not my book list. There was crap on there that I would never read. After I saw it I deleted the account. I hadn't visited in many years and can't be bothered with social sites in general. I still drop into slashdot and hacker news on occasion if I'm bored. I don't comment very much any more. I'm too busy or can't be bothered.
> 
> Flink is a random name I picked as a throwaway for a site I needed to register on to use when I didn't want to use my current address.  

Debunk: Come on, that book list was definitely Mike's. If he read DK Moran's books, those on his goodreads were right up his alley. He is telling the truth about the name flink. trentthethief is based off of DK Moran, and so is ring (Ring is the name of an AI in DK Moran books), so as far as I can tell flink was a random name/email he chose.

> 
> A: I am trentthethief on slashdot and on FARK (I didn't know FARK was still alive)  

No debunk, truth here.

> Q: Did you embed hidden data (TI calculator something or another) within the html of crystalwinds? Was this a fairly common practice among savvy web hosts at the time?
> 
> 
> A: I did hide the TI calc stuff to mirror it and avoid takedown notices. There was a big thing going on about TI and their calculator code on Slashdot. I'd mirrored other information in the past yo keep it from being hidden/suppressed (the UK JET Report being one of note: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sci.psychology.misc/1J7hBuZnOTA/RXY9hAnDXTAJ). I think another slashdotter made the suggestion about hiding info in comments. 

Debunk: So Mike was going along with trends? Sounds like he created the image host and thought of a clever way to mess with people by commenting fake hidden messages in the index html.

> Q: Do you think it is purely coincidental that LCQP used the same invisible ink method, or do you think they selected your services for some reason because of this?
> 
> 
> A: Maybe LC hid it that because it's relatively easy to do if you have access to the files. Maybe it was easier for them to tell someone how to find the comments rather than making login details that can be forgotten and figuring out how to give new credentials when the user forgets. I don't know. The only other comments I've ever seen in html code are about settings or something else related to the page.

> It's not very likely I was chosen unless I was being tracked as if in a conspiracy movie. It was a very random meeting. But not uncommon, I'd think, given how many blank faces I've seen in computer stores.

Debunk: Mike keeps trying to say he had no idea how they got the idea to use the same method of hiding text in a webpage as he did less than a week prior? Huh, must be a giant coincidence then, lets pack it up boys, no need to dig deeper. /s

Today, I decided to take a day off and see if I could get some work done on my bike at The Squeaky Wheel. But before getting into the labor for the day, I decided to check out [Dough EV](https://doughev.com/), based on the recommendations from my last post.

In terms of bikability, its [located ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g8DJciK2BWfGmYGm6)on Dundas, which has protected bike lanes all the way through, making it an easy detour from the TVP. As for locking up, there’s a bike post right by the front door, but it was already taken. Luckily, the cages around the trees (which are sturdy) did the trick just fine.

Inside, the café is super cute and funky—honestly felt like I was in a trendy spot in New York City rather than London, Ontario. It’s definitely the kind of place perfect for an Instagram-worthy shot with friends. The outside, though, is Dundas Street—so not much to photograph there.

Now, the coffee: hands down the best cortado I’ve had so far, and at $4.50, it’s not even the priciest! It was so good that after finishing the first, I went ahead and ordered a second. The barista there really knows their stuff, and the only word to describe their cup is *smooooooth.* I even bought a bag of the roast they used to try and recreate it at home. Presentation wise it was served in a unique [mug ](https://www.gharyan.ca/products/coffee-cup-6-oz)which i always appreciate - and it was also the nicest latte art ive had so far (which is impressive in such a small mug opening). Also - this was the first shop where someone had asked if i was the reddit reviewer, so my ""cover"" was blown but it was nice to see that an actual barista read and enjoy the reviews!

Side note: the sour cream glazed donut was the best I’ve ever had. They also carry gluten-free treats from Helms Baked and even offer gluten-free bread for their sandwiches—so I’ll definitely have to bring my fiancée here.

Honestly, I can’t say much more than **you have to try this place.** Thanks to everyone who recommended it—Dough EV has definitely raised the bar for my café reviews going forward. And no I could not make a better cup at home…yet!

  
And for those who were wondering - yes i did get some work done on my bike! Changed out the grip shifters for some old school friction thumbies. If you need bike work done deffintely check out Squeaky wheel an learn to do it yourself ! well with the help of the volunteers :)

Week 2: no side effects except for one nausea episode, and hunger reduction lasted pretty much the whole week.

Week 3: I am having insane indigestion, feeling like a lump is in my throat, and constant burping basically immediately after eating (but they aren’t suffer burps), no matter what I eat, even with small portions. I do notice that It seems to be the timing of eating. In the morning I will have a premier protein drink with my coffee with no issue whatsoever. My work lunch break is at 11 am and this week I tried to have another protein shake at lunch, and I started having this indigestion burping attack. 

It doesn’t happen too terribly if I skip lunch entirely but I’m really trying to make sure I get at least enough protein and nutrients through the day. I’ve basically only been able to have ramen broth/tofu for dinner. 

I also have a hiatal hernia which reaaaaallly doesn’t help. I already take omeprazole in the am, take a digestive enzyme with every meal, and take a probiotic daily.

Has anyone dealt with this and did it get any better with time? Or are there any OTC medications that helped you with this? 

Also please let me know of any suggestions for GOOD digestive enzymes that work because I feel like my source naturals are not doing anything.

I realized I was still in my robe but I felt weird about leaving a strange man in my living room by himself white I got dressed. So instead I asked him if he wanted to join me in the hot tub while his phone charged. I warned him I typically went nude. He did not hesitate and began removing his clothes.

We were chatting about his journey and how he was also on the road to finding himself. In this world of technology we both agreed that taking a break from it all and recluding to a more simple lifestyle was the best way to reconnect with oneself and nature. As we continued to talk I could see that he was also getting aroused. He was rather large and it kept peaking out of the water to say hello. He was being a gentleman so I decided to gently put my hand on his thigh as we were talking. He grabbed my hand and pulled me on his lap and we started kissing passionately. Rubbing each other and his arms around my waist. It went on for hours. He picked me up and put me on the side of the hot tub and started eating me like a bowl of fresh peaches. It was incredible.

**National Forest Service logo inspiration**

VS Outdoor Script draws its inspiration from the trailhead signs and wayfinding found in the National Forests and in mountain towns across the US. 

This nostalgic script is more than just functional—it was created to capture the memories of hikes through forests as a kid, campfires under star-lit skies, and road trips through vast and open landscapes.

This font features soft, rounded letterforms with a few unique ligatures that give it a “perfectly imperfect” look, reminiscent of hand-crafted signage crafted by the National Forest Service. The natural and organic style makes it ideal for designs trying to convey warmth, friendliness, and a genuine love or connection for the outdoors.

Here are the lists of ingredients that Tea Burn contains are as follows:

Green Tea

Green Tea extract is a great ingredient in the Tea Burn weight loss product because it contains natural caffeine that helps with weight loss, but its main power comes from the antioxidants present in it. EGCG is one of the antioxidants present in the weight loss formula. EGCG helps to support healthy inflammation in the body, which can help with weight loss.

Amino Acid

Tea Burn contains two amino acids, L-theanine and L-carnitine. These amino acids help to improve focus and concentration. Theanine helps decrease anxiety, stress, and jittery attacks while being on their weight loss supplements. Carnitine helps people lower the side effects posed by caffeine on the human body when consumed regularly.

Green Coffee Bean Extract

The Tea Burn product contains green coffee bean extract because of its primary ingredient, chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid is high in antioxidant properties, which help flush all the toxins from the body and make it more adaptable to weight loss and weight management systems. In addition to this, chlorogenic acid works with the EGCG present in green tea extract to help boost the effectiveness of Tea Burn.

Minerals

Chromium is an essential mineral that is found in Tea Burn. It helps with various functions of the body such as blood sugar management and weight management. When your blood sugar levels are under control, you are less likely to get hungry and have food cravings at night.

Caffeine

Caffeine is a stimulant that helps boost metabolic levels in human beings. It also has benefits for weight loss and fat burning. Adding caffeine to your beverage every day in the morning can help make it more effective.

Tea Burn is a weight loss supplement that contains ingredients like green tea. These ingredients help you lose weight, and they have antioxidant properties that improve your health.

What is Tea Burn?

Tea Burn is a revolutionary dietary supplement that has been making waves in the health and wellness industry. Marketed as a patent-pending, completely safe, and all-natural proprietary formula, Tea Burn is designed to be an effortless solution for weight loss and metabolism boosting.

What sets Tea Burn apart from other supplements is its unique approach: it’s formulated to be mixed with tea, aiming to enhance the natural benefits of your daily cup while providing additional health advantages.

The creators of Tea Burn claim that their product is the world’s first and only 100% safe and natural proprietary formula that, when combined with tea, can increase both the speed and efficiency of metabolism.

How Does Tea Burn Work?

The mechanism behind Tea Burn’s effectiveness is multifaceted, targeting various aspects of metabolism and overall health. The creators of Tea Burn have designed the supplement to work in harmony with tea, enhancing its natural properties while adding its own unique benefits.

At its core, Tea Burn aims to boost metabolism. A faster metabolism means your body burns calories more efficiently, even when at rest.

This increased metabolic rate can lead to more effective weight loss and improved energy levels throughout the day. The supplement achieves this through a carefully selected blend of ingredients known for their metabolism-boosting properties.

Tea Burn also focuses on optimizing the body’s fat burning processes. Some of its ingredients are believed to help the body target stubborn fat areas, making it easier to shed those extra pounds that often resist traditional diet and exercise methods. By enhancing fat oxidation, Tea Burn may help users achieve their weight loss goals more quickly and effectively.

Tea Burn Ingredients

Tea Burn’s effectiveness is largely attributed to its unique blend of natural ingredients. Each component has been selected for its potential to contribute to weight loss, metabolism boosting, and overall health improvement. Let’s explore the key ingredients found in Tea Burn:



L-Carnitine

This amino acid plays a crucial role in fat metabolism. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

L-Carnitine supplementation may enhance fat burning, particularly during exercise, and could potentially improve exercise performance.

Green Tea Extract

Rich in catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), green tea extract is known for its powerful antioxidant properties. It may boost metabolism, increase fat oxidation, and improve insulin sensitivity.

The caffeine content in green tea can also provide an energy boost and enhance focus.

Coffee Extract

It’s also a source of caffeine, which can increase metabolism and improve mental alertness.

L-Theanine

An amino acid commonly found in tea leaves,is known for its calming effects. It can help reduce stress and anxiety, potentially counteracting the jittery effects of caffeine.

Chromium

This essential trace mineral plays a role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

Chromium may help reduce cravings for carbohydrates and support healthy blood sugar levels, which can be beneficial for weight management.

Green Coffee Bean Extract

Unroasted coffee beans contain higher levels of chlorogenic acid compared to roasted beans.

This compound may help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract and lower insulin levels, potentially promoting weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert food into energy and can support a healthy nervous system.

Adequate B vitamin levels may help combat fatigue and support overall metabolic health.

Vitamin D

Forskolin

(Yes I understand that was a little risky). I finally got it today and when washing it, noticed some greyish colouring coming off. So I wiped it down with a tissue and found this greyish residue coming off. Inside the pots, it seemed fine, but the screw area with the threads seem to be the cause of concern. The only explanation I can come up with it, is that it's residual metal powder after filing it down. I'm wondering what to do? It's not where the actual coffee will be going through but I'm not sure if it will be safe.

What is Tea Burn?

Tea Burn is a revolutionary dietary supplement that has been making waves in the health and wellness industry. Marketed as a patent-pending, completely safe, and all-natural proprietary formula, Tea Burn is designed to be an effortless solution for weight loss and metabolism boosting.

What sets Tea Burn apart from other supplements is its unique approach: it’s formulated to be mixed with tea, aiming to enhance the natural benefits of your daily cup while providing additional health advantages.

The creators of Tea Burn claim that their product is the world’s first and only 100% safe and natural proprietary formula that, when combined with tea, can increase both the speed and efficiency of metabolism.

This flavorless powder is said to work synergistically with tea to create what they call “super tea,” amplifying the effects and creating a more powerful beverage for weight loss and overall health.

How Does Tea Burn Work?

The mechanism behind Tea Burn’s effectiveness is multifaceted, targeting various aspects of metabolism and overall health. The creators of Tea Burn have designed the supplement to work in harmony with tea, enhancing its natural properties while adding its own unique benefits.

At its core, Tea Burn aims to boost metabolism. A faster metabolism means your body burns calories more efficiently, even when at rest.

This increased metabolic rate can lead to more effective weight loss and improved energy levels throughout the day. The supplement achieves this through a carefully selected blend of ingredients known for their metabolism-boosting properties.

Tea Burn also focuses on optimizing the body’s fat burning processes. Some of its ingredients are believed to help the body target stubborn fat areas, making it easier to shed those extra pounds that often resist traditional diet and exercise methods. By enhancing fat oxidation, Tea Burn may help users achieve their weight loss goals more quickly and effectively.

Tea Burn Ingredients

Tea Burn’s effectiveness is largely attributed to its unique blend of natural ingredients. Each component has been selected for its potential to contribute to weight loss, metabolism boosting, and overall health improvement. Let’s explore the key ingredients found in Tea Burn:



L-Carnitine

This amino acid plays a crucial role in fat metabolism. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

L-Carnitine supplementation may enhance fat burning, particularly during exercise, and could potentially improve exercise performance.

Green Tea Extract

Rich in catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), green tea extract is known for its powerful antioxidant properties. It may boost metabolism, increase fat oxidation, and improve insulin sensitivity.

The caffeine content in green tea can also provide an energy boost and enhance focus.

Coffee Extract

# [Click to Visit the Official Website](https://tinyurl.com/3uus4sns)

Containing chlorogenic acid, coffee extract may help slow the absorption of carbohydrates and support blood sugar regulation.

It’s also a source of caffeine, which can increase metabolism and improve mental alertness.

L-Theanine

An amino acid commonly found in tea leaves,is known for its calming effects. It can help reduce stress and anxiety, potentially counteracting the jittery effects of caffeine.

L-Theanine may also improve focus and cognitive performance when combined with caffeine.

Chromium

This essential trace mineral plays a role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

Chromium may help reduce cravings for carbohydrates and support healthy blood sugar levels, which can be beneficial for weight management.

Green Coffee Bean Extract

Unroasted coffee beans contain higher levels of chlorogenic acid compared to roasted beans.

This compound may help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract and lower insulin levels, potentially promoting weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert food into energy and can support a healthy nervous system.

# [Click to Visit the Official Website](https://tinyurl.com/3uus4sns)

Adequate B vitamin levels may help combat fatigue and support overall metabolic health.

Vitamin D

While primarily known for its role in bone health, vitamin D may also play a part in weight management.

Some studies suggest that adequate vitamin D levels could help reduce body fat and support healthy metabolism.

Garcinia Cambogia Extract

Derived from a tropical fruit, this extract contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which may help block fat production and suppress appetite. Some studies suggest it could aid in weight loss efforts.

Forskolin

Extracted from the roots of the Coleus forskohlii plant, forskolin may help boost metabolism and promote the breakdown of stored fats in the body.

These ingredients work synergistically to create a comprehensive approach to weight management and metabolic health. The precise blend and proportions of these ingredients in Tea Burn are part of the product’s proprietary formula, which the manufacturers claim is key to its effectiveness.

We’ve been trying to clear the drains with baking soda and vinegar. But no matter where we turn or what we do if we bump a single surface about 20 gnats fly off the area. I’m losing my mind. We’re not even terribly dirty people. Sure we let the laundry lay out for a while and have napkins or coffee cups out on occasion but I’m not understanding why there are so many! We have 6 of those apple gnat traps out, that when looking into them have caught too many to count. It also just seems like when they are hanging out around the gnat traps it’s just an easy collective breeding ground for them more than a killing trap. I’m at the end of my rope. 

Background: we own two cats, which means they come with litter boxes. I also own numerous houseplants and tend to try and let them dry out between watering. I also do spray household pest spray on them and the top soil.

Week 2: no side effects except for one nausea episode, and hunger reduction lasted pretty much the whole week.

Week 3: I am having insane indigestion, feeling like a lump is in my throat, and constant burping basically immediately after eating (but they aren’t suffer burps), no matter what I eat, even with small portions. I do notice that It seems to be the timing of eating. In the morning I will have a premier protein drink with my coffee with no issue whatsoever. My work lunch break is at 11 am and this week I tried to have another protein shake at lunch, and I started having this indigestion burping attack.

I also have a hiatal hernia which reaaaaallly doesn’t help. I already take omeprazole in the am, take a digestive enzyme with every meal, and take a probiotic daily.

Has anyone dealt with this and did it get any better with time? Or are there any OTC medications that helped you with this?

Medications are metformin 500 mg, 4000 IU vitamin D3, fish oil.

I had posterior approach hip replacement surgery and a revision 5 weeks later. These surgeries were done at a rural hospital with spinal anesthesia. 

I got a spinal headache after the revision (diagnosed by 2 doctors) and was told to stop the daily aspirin in case I needed a blood patch, and if it got worse, go to the ER at a city hospital.  

The surgeon was unhappy about stopping the aspirin. I decided DVT was a more serious risk than PDPH and ran that by the family doctor,  and kept taking aspirin for the full month. The headache, eustachian tube dysfunction and nausea continued.

My pain from the headache was about 5 to 6/10 at first,  and over 6 weeks,  it's about a 2 or 3. Each week,  I do get a bit better. Chugging coffee works great and there's almost no pain then, and there is 0 pain laying down. 

I'm limited in what I can do, though,  no bending, lifting,  twisting.  I feel this is interfering with recovery from the hip replacement. 

I wonder if I should keep waiting to heal by myself,  or should I get a blood patch? 

I'm not getting any useful guidance nor a referral from the rural clinic and hospital. They kept saying for the past 6 weeks that I'll be better in a couple of days.

I'm going to ask the surgeon for a referral if I know i need a blood patch,  but I've struck out so much not getting any guidance I wanted to ask here.

One night I looked up the instagram to see if there were any drink specials and instead I saw a reel featuring this cute employee i saw once in passing. Later that week I saw this employee again and it was like this instant connection. He stared at me the entire time I was in there and made the most intense eye contact i’ve ever had with anyone. It was like the closest feeling to love at first sight. My friend was with me and she witnessed it all and was like “oh my god what?!?” so then over the course of the next month I went in a lot more and the staring and eye contact continued but I didn’t even know his name but I was developing feelings without really knowing him, just one of those instant things (I had never experienced this before). Then one night I finally did an instagram deep dive and found out his name and such but also that he had a girlfriend so I mourned the idea of that but was fine going in and letting whatever happens happen. Then he was really off for a week and me and my friend both had this gut feeling him and his girlfriend broke up. His instagram is private and I don’t follow it but the posts went from 27 to 24. And also he started actually kind of flirting with me (remembering my name without me ever telling him, just typing it in), light teasing, still lots of eye contact and staring lmao) He seems really shy. Then last Monday he was in the middle of a task and I was looking at food and he turned around and started a conversation with me out of the blue. Again he’s super shy and doesn’t talk a lot and not a typical flirty barista. So I felt like this meant something. And the conversation was super unnecessary he had to turn around and get my attention to ask “Did i catch you on your way to work this morning?” Anyway so now fast forward to this week I’m feeling pretty confident that a) they broke up and b) that he likes me so i decided to request to follow him on instagram. and he rejects it. I’m very confused by this behavior and i’m scared to go in again because i don’t want to make him uncomfortable or myself feel worse.

I (45M) grew up watching friends have alcoholic parents and it was one of the saddest things I observed growing up. I made an agreement with myself to never be in that situation or to put my own children in that situation. As such, I established a couple of verbal pre-nuptial agreements with my now wife before we were married including 1) that she wouldn't continue to use pot as she was doing when we were dating, 2) was that if our marriage didn't ever work out, I would get my kids. We dated for two years before getting engaged and ultimately married. During that time, and based on my concern, she quit consuming pot regularly however we drank alcohol socially. Occasionally we would dabble with other things recreationally. I'm pretty ok (and have always been) with recreational use as long as kids aren't around and there's no possibility of fentanyl poisoning/death. Shortly after getting married she lost her job and began staying home.  I noticed her beginning to drink heavily after staying home within 6 months of our marriage and had to give her an ultimatum to dry out for 30 days or I would not continue in the marriage.  She started a new job and put her energy into contributing to the family and her work and not drinking a bottle of wine every night.  She resumed social usage of alcohol and we would cook and even brew beer together. 

She entered the marriage in 2012 with an 8yo M and an 18yo M from two different fathers from previous marriages. I took the 8 year old under my wing and was ecstatic to be a stepfather. The 18 year old moved out as I moved in and I've been a mentor for him as much as I could be. We married when the 8 year old was 10 and endured his mental illness while we worked on having our own children. He was ultimately diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and became violent at our home when my oldest son was between the ages of 0-2. The therapist then told us he was a lost cause and we needed to focus on staying strong for each other. We did. By the hardest.  I was put in a position to have to tell my wife that I wasn't ok having my son in the house with a violent teenager and that he needed to go live with his father. Until this point that was a nonstarter conversation with her but I arrived at the point that I was willing to divorce or separate over the issue to protect my son (and myself) from harm and or the damage that could be done on my son from witnessing the outbursts and repeated visits by the police to our home. That was one of the hardest conversations I've ever had to have, telling her she had to choose between her son and the rest of her family. She chose to let him go and he hasn't been back since 2018. The courts finally agreed to place the younger stepson in state custody at an inpatient facility and peace returned to our household.

If you want to know what hell on earth is, relive this scenario. 

 Her oldest reached out for help around this time acknowledging being a heroin addict.  I drove 18 hours to pick him up and bring him home to get him dried out.  He couldn't beat the addiction and I ended up telling him I couldn't raise my children in a home with a heroin addict. He ended up homeless for a bit before going to a couple 2-3 year stints in state prison. (I'm glad to say 10 yrs later he's now clean and expecting his own child!).

We continued working on having another child and she delivered a beautiful baby boy in 2017. Life was good until 2019 when we met some new friends who regularly smoked pot.  I was ok with the occasional dabble by my wife and I joined occasionally, but it quickly turned into habitual use. The friend who smoked the most, was high as a kite most of the time, acknowledged that my wife could smoke him under the table. Fast forward 4 years and she uses daily, makes her own oil, vapes, and smokes in the evenings before and after the kids have gone to bed. She's never been that socially outgoing but I've noticed that she's become even more inward in the past couple of years. If we do things socially, she frequently doesn't feel good or comes up with some reason to leave early and come home. When we go out to eat with the sports team and our kids' friends' parents, we frequently end up at a table that is away from the group and I split my time with the other adults and where my wife sits.  I can't help but wonder if the THC is driving some of the less-than-social behavior. I'm conditioned now to take separate cars or not even invite her.

She's highly functional and prepares breakfast and dinner daily and mostly keeps up with laundry. I hire a maid and pay almost all of the bills. She's taken a job since I've taken issue with paying for her pot (\~$400/month) and I won't raise the amount of money I give her for groceries over the last four years.  In the last four years I've moved out of the master bedroom because she wakes me up being clumsy finding her way to the bathroom in the middle of the night, loudly opening/closing the doors, and rattling the Benadryl bottle to take more sedative to help her sleep at night. She breaks almost anything she comes into contact with, frequently glasses or coffee mugs while loading dishes. She's OCD about cleaning and puts everything ""in it's place"". The rest of us frequently can't find our things as they've been put away where she want them to be. She gripes about my coffee spoon on the counter right next to where she spills and leaves coffee every cup that she pours from the carafe. Some of that is just standard cost of doing business as a married couple. In 2022 after going through some couples and individual therapy. Our therapist and I concluded that I either needed to accept it or assert the boundary with a consequence.  Boundary being end the addiction, consequence being separation if not.    I decided to just get past my own hangup of worrying about her pot use. It is just pot after all and she's highly functional (am I in denial now too?)  Two plus years later, that hasn't been effective.

Now my 7 year old has begun down the path of his older step brother with the behavior that my step son exhibited when we were trying to get him diagnosed.  He's in 2nd grade now and declining quickly with his interactions with peers and adults at the school and negative attention seeking behavior. He and my wife are like oil and water. They clash every morning which sets him off on a crash course to school. I can't blame his behavior on her but he's lost any respect for her and I believe his behavior is worse with her reactions to him. to be fair, he's difficult with me and his brother too. It's not just her but there's a difficult relationship there as there was with my step son. There have been small misses on our parts as parents such as not getting signed up for the classroom email list or scheduling the parent teacher conference or the sports team photos, but they're all adding up to making me question if her self medicating is contributing to giving less than 100% to our sons, especially the one needing it the most. I've taken over getting him to his therapy appointments because she wasn't consistent in getting them booked.  She has successfully gotten him an appointment with a behavioral psychologist next week and we'll be taking him together. When I find out she's not doing something I've expected her to handle I get accused of being manic for not waiting any longer and handling it myself. I have taken over getting their uniforms together for sporting events (when I can find them). A complete uniform is rare for us. I don't count on her and she doesn't volunteer to help with much else with our kids but she takes the older one to music lessons once a week. Now that I'm coaching the older one's team, she's been mostly taking the younger one to his sports 3x a week.

I've found that I've become increasingly resentful of her in the past couple of years and identifying links to THC. Perhaps I'm looking for a reason for my unhappiness and it's the perfect scapegoat?  I realized that talking myself into ignoring her use a couple of years ago wasn't successful, it just led to more resentment by me.  I resent that I'm now living the scenario that I hated for my friends growing up. I resent that I'm questioning breaking my family apart because she has disregarded our agreement and is now a habitual user.  I've now told her that I've been resentful and that I don't want us to continue on this path. I don't want to look back in 3, 4 or 5 years and have a disaster for a son and question whether my partner was putting in 100%.  I would rather know that I'm the sole contributor than to think I have an equal partner and not actually have it. Over the last week she's kept asking what's wrong with me and I've just keep repeating that I'm resentful and trying to make sense of our paths forward. She's offered to leave but is upset about it and says I'm just looking for a reason because I'm the unhappy one as I'm unhappy with my job and my boss.  She's upset that we'll be disrupting our kids lives (as am I) and subjecting them to our future potential partners and moving them around and there is the acknowledged potential that this will make things worse for our youngest and even create issues for our oldest son.  When I've asked her to compare her addiction to another friend of ours who is a functional alcoholic, she tells me it's different for her because this is her medicine which has allowed her to finally have found inner peace and she wouldn't change that for anyone or anything.  This reminds me of typical addict behavior even more. I explained that it's driven us apart because she goes to bed early at 9:00-9:30pm, it stinks, she stinks after using it, she uses in the house with smoke and vape pen despite my objections, she's not social, we're hardly ever intimate, I don't want to take her anywhere with me, she leaves her shit laying around where my kids can find it on occasion, kids ask me why is mommy smoking when they see her vape when she thinks she's being discreet, her eyes are half closed at dinner, she gets embarrassingly plowed after a couple of beers when we drink socially.

  She claims that she'll be getting her medical card due to a *spinal issue* that she's found which BTW many of us have over the age of 40 (degenerative disc disease). She'll not likely qualify for the card based on this in Texas. I've explained that her self medication is the problem and that she needs to talk to a doctor to get properly treated for the variety of ailments she claims to have. She's got great links to internet sources stating how beneficial THC is…. She won't change and we're at the point where I need to tell her to leave. I've bought a little time by asking her to see our therapist together again but she doesn't want to. I presume the meeting with our therapist that she had this week didn't go her way.  She's stated that she'll still be involved with the kids and she won't change so the only thing that will change will be dissolution of our romantic relationship. (I'd argue that part is pretty far gone already).

1g0sqw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1g0sqw0/hair_salon_tipping/,Hair Salon tipping,"I just got hair done yesterday at the salon and I LOVE the girl who does my hair. She's a couple years younger then me and we have fun every time I come in. I'm that girl that gets her hair dyed fun colors and each time she loves that I have something new up my sleeve. However my girl has been getting booked out like crazy which I love for her but it sucked bc I'm going to Renaissance Festival on Sunday and when I had called to schedule an appointment her earliest time was end of October. I told them if anything opens up I want IN!! Well the salon calls me and texts me Monday saying my girl had an opening on Wed! Yayyyy I snag the appointment work out a deal w my coworker since I was supposed to work Wednesday and off I go to salon 2 days later. I show up and bring her her favorite coffee (bc minimum she's gonna be working on my hair for at least 4hrs). I get there and realize oh right it's Wednesday she never works Wednesdays. Turns out her bday was in 2 days and she wanted some extra money for her bday so she opened up a big time slot and then proceeded to find out one of her favorite clients (me) had been begging to get in earlier. Any how my appointment normally comes out to about 250-300 dollars. However this time we went more platinum blonde and did extra fun color as well as fairy hair since I'm attending the renfair and am going as a fairy. So it came out to more then I expected but I also tipped her more then I normally do essentially as a bday gift. Normally I tip 18% and bring her a coffee. Yesterday I tipped 25% and brought her coffee. I love my hair and it's the one beauty thing I spoil myself in. I have crappy nails, I don't get fancy lashes, I don't buy expensive makeup. My hair is 1 treat 8-10weeks and I work hard to be able to afford it. Generally I agree tip culture is out of control big time but stylists do work hard to give you exactly what you want.

Hi! I am currently looking for someone to take over my lease here at Cullen Oaks as I need to move closer to my new job. I am looking to move out asap, but am open to waiting till the spring semester.

I live in a 2Bed 2Bath Grad fully furnished unit at Cullen Oaks, which is on campus. Even though this is student housing, you do NOT have to buy a meal plan. Rent is $1349 and includes utilities. I am offering $250 to anybody who takes my lease right now! 

The Grad refers to the fact that it is fully furnished and comes with a washer and dryer inside the apartment as opposed to having to share one with others. Additionally, there are only 6 Grad Units in the entire apartment complex.

The apartment comes with a couch, dining room table, 3 coffee-like tables in the living room, and in the room, it comes with a dresser, study desk, and a twin xl bed and mattress. 

I live in room B. Unlike my A, room B has the bathroom connected to the room and is much bigger! 

I live with one girl and she’s super sweet and chill! She is usually out majority of the day at work or school, so the place is pretty quiet; if you like having your own space, this is perfect! 

Cullen Oaks has its own 24/7 gym and study center with access to computers and a printer.

As far as parking goes, a parking pass at Cullen allowed you to park at multiple zones at UH.

I’m still at 180 ish sleep styles so I won’t get to the new area for a while and wanted to check if my incense catches are good enough to invest candies into or if I should wait and hope for better ones throughout the event. 

I feel like the Grubbin is pretty decent since I don’t have to wait for 25/50 for an ingredient subskill and it has all coffee but I was wondering if the subskill makes it worse since exp up seems pretty trivial compared to msc down. For the Aron I think the first two skills are helpful but I don’t have very many subskill seeds (am on premium though) and have some other mons I’m looking to seed as well. The shinx I’m on the fence about because even though it doesn’t have ingredient subskills that aren’t at 100 it has skill related ones so I was thinking of using it as a pot expander, but I guess it might make more sense to invest in a proper skill mon instead.

My phone had died, and of course, it had to start raining. No buses were running that late, and the streets were empty. I was exhausted, cold, and starting to get desperate. That’s when I saw an older man approaching slowly, his footsteps muffled by the rain. He was in his late sixties, maybe older, with a gentle face and a worn coat that hung off his broad shoulders. He noticed me struggling with my broken umbrella.

“Are you alright, miss?” he asked, keeping his distance, his voice soft but concerned.

I hesitated, unsure whether to engage, but I was soaked and had no other options. “I missed the last bus, and my phone's dead,"" I admitted, trying to keep my voice steady. He nodded as if he understood.

“I’ve got a spare umbrella and a power bank,” he said, gesturing to the bag slung over his shoulder. “It’s just up to you if you want to borrow them.”

There was something about the way he spoke; gentle, with no pressure, that made me trust him. He handed me the umbrella and let me use his power bank without standing too close or lingering. He even pointed me in the direction of a nearby coffee where I could wait for a taxi.

Afterward, as he walked away, I realized how much care he had taken to respect my space. He could’ve easily walked me to the coffee or insisted on waiting with me, but he didn’t. Instead, he gave me what I needed and made sure I was safe from a distance.

I think about him sometimes. About how in a world where we’re taught to be wary, he was careful in the best way possible; kind, but not overbearing. I’ll always be grateful for that.",66,1728592641.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.94,False

I asked her to shut it down and ship it back, and I sent her a new laptop ready to go.  A few days later I got a laptop back from her, but it was the replacement I sent her, not the mocha-latte laptop.

I called her with a ""hey where's the soggy laptop"" and she replied that she decided to try turning it on (!?!?!) as she didn't want to try the other laptop...with ""new"" software...and it worked ""just fine""...

Fast forward to last week and I finally get this laptop back as the coffee-slosher has left the company, and it works as it should except for a few things:

The trackpad works, but the L&R buttons are both really intermittent.  I've removed and cleaned the track pad, but it's still pretty dodgy.  New (used) trackpad is on order.

The other weird thing is that the keyboard backlight is super intermittent.  It just randomly flashes when the machine is at idle, comes on with every button push on the keyboard and is no longer controlled by the F5 key.

Every other key on the KB is functioning as it should.  I did find some gunk on the KBBL ribbon connector and cleaner it along with the socket on the MB, but it's still flashy...

Any ideas what to try next?  My new CFO wants this as her laptop, but I'm reluctant to give it to her until I can resolve these 2 things.

This is my first post here, and I’m hoping to get some advice on how to land a job in a café. I understand that the job market isn’t great right now, but I’ve seen a lot of café job openings that stay posted for weeks, which has left me a bit confused.

For context, I have over two years of experience in the hospitality industry, I can provide references, and I’m passionate about building a career in the coffee industry. I’ve also taken some courses and really enjoy the café atmosphere.

My question is for café owners or experienced café workers: What sets candidates apart when applying for a barista or café job?

I’ve noticed people getting hired who immediately check their phones when they can, some who don’t speak English well, and even others with no experience at all.

Also, I’ve come across cafés where it seems like only people from specific communities are hired. It feels difficult to apply in those cases because I’m not part of those communities. Has anyone else experienced this, or is there something I’m missing?

What makes it worse is I was speaking about personal things and my feeling with her earlier.

We connected outside of work and then he got my number. Then were texting a little bit but we are both bad at responding quickly. He would come by my desk and talk to me most days. It was clear I made him pretty nervous (which was very endearing) and he brought by a treat he baked one time. Then he asked me for coffee over the weekend. I said I was busy because I genuinely was very busy with family stuff (which has been nonstop for me) but did not say anything about another time because I was still not sure about him… it is a risk for me to date a coworker and especially one who works for the same group. I just wish he would have waited to ask and seen if we clicked in conversation more. I think once it is going into pre-date material, it is a risk… I have already dated someone from work where it did not end well and it is awkward even when we hardly interact. I can’t imagine that with someone I see every day. He has been keeping his distance since and so have I so it hasn’t been that bad. I do kind of regret not getting to know him a bit better though… I just do not like to date coworkers because I’m horrible at hiding things like that and suddenly everyone in the office will know. But there is still a part of me that wonders what could have been. I have kept my distance to avoid leading him on or hurting him but he has been on my mind a lot lately… idk exactly why I’m making this post because I already have so much going on and adding a guy onto that would be a bad idea… I guess just needing some support. I’m one of those people who is lonely a lot but is trying to solve my issues on my own rather than getting distracted with a partner. It is just hard when ultimately I do want one!",0,1728591201.0,dating_advice,12,0.17,False

She also said some other hurtful things like that she was settling, and that I couldn't emotionally support her correctly compared with her other guy friends who have known her for way longer.

I guess I always thought that love wasn't just a feeling, but rather a choice that you make and then carry out through actions even if you don't like the person during fights and stuff like that. Am I wrong?",21,1728591123.0,love,8,0.86,False

They can be associated with Hellenism but I'll also be grateful for any additional tips, places worth visiting. Also, if you know of any shops that sell statues and other things from Greek mythology, please, let me know. I'm looking for things for my altar but there is hardly any selection in my country.

Alternatively, if there are any London Hellenists who would like to meet and grab a cup of tea or coffee and chat, let me know. I understand that a lot of people here prefer to remain anonymous (and that's okay) but I just thought I'd throw the invitation out here anyway. :-)

P.S. it's not my first time in London so I've already been to most of the major places, such as the Buckingham Palace, the Westminster Abbey, Madam Tussauds, the Tower of London, etc.",2,1728591096.0,Hellenism,1,1.0,False

We have lived in the Dallas areas for a while now. We are here for my spouse’s decent job. It is the only reason that we moved here and have stayed. After recently having a child, we are evaluating whether to make a move. We are both 40, originally from NY/NJ and have no desire to ever live in the tri-state area again. We would love to be within a 10 hour drive though for easier access to family and friends than we have now. We have a certain metro area in mind as number one and a few others on the list. I seek insight from the sub to validate and perhaps expand options. I am inquisitive in general, and I like data.

What we want to avoid…

- Scorching hot heat and prolonged summers
- Extreme winters
- Political extremes
- Junk food
- Hyper focus on sports
- Overall uncivilized behavior…loud cars, irresponsible pet owners, lack of community involvement

I feel like a majority of people here in the DFW area dart manically from restaurants to stores. People almost accept these very long, traffic filled, concrete laden drives to nowhere particular. Just constant low-quality, consumerism driven activities… Consuming mixed drinks on eatery patios in heat from March until October, sometimes longer. It may sound odd if you have never lived here, but perhaps those who have understand the vibe.

We prefer mountains over the beach and love Fall and open window weather. Neither of us drink alcohol. We like road trips but are not into major travel, definite homebodies. We love being outdoors in nature, cooking and watching TV. A fun Friday night would be walking around a tree filled area with good coffee and our child and dog, then making food at home outside in a small, well designed yard. Make it under 70 degrees with a breeze.

- Decent overall affordability…we would be striving for a housing budget of $600,000 for roughly 2,300 sqft
- An abundance of trees
- Quiet suburb
- Health and wellness oriented…Easy access to Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Sprouts etc. The less fast food culture the better
- Educated populace, excellent public schools
- Climate…four moderate seasons, no common tornadoes, hurricanes or hail. Home insurance is going to be a major issue moving forward in areas with extreme weather
- High home ownership rate
- HOA Community
- Soft Water
- Good air quality",0,1728591040.0,SameGrassButGreener,11,0.44,False
