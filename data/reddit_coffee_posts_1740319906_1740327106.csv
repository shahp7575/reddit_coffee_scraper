every time i’ve heard “its just coffee” its been used in some dismissive dumbass context. its a dumb thing to tell angry customers/partners, when what we really should be doing is trying to understand their issue and help solve it. its more than coffee. social interaction is really complex, gestures and facial expressions can really mean a lot. i like the “make the moment right” starbucks philosophy, but i really don’t think saying “its just coffee” ever makes the moment right. it makes the moment cringey and sour. i hope somebody understands what im trying to say in this post ",1,1740326840.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I was thinking about SHTF situations, it's bad if you have addictions, there are no supermarkets, no coffee shops, no shops to buy booze or cigarettes.

Cigarettes last for 1 year on average in my country, booze if it's wine it can last ""forever"". Beer doesn't have a great shelf life, I don't drink alcohol so I don't know how many months or years it usually lasts.

It's hard to quit stuff that make you an addict, but I think it's probably worth it long term, you can spend the money elsewhere. With the money you are spending with addictions you could store way more **food and water** and make you and your family feel safer and prepared.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Not much, just a regular, convenient €30 payment or so each month, nothing that I'm not willing to lose. Beats betting on football!
It seems like a decent long-term investment to me, I figure it's likely that, in the long-term, supply will decrease (climate change), while demand will not (it's basically a harmless, socially acceptable drug that billions are low-key addicted to, including myself). 
I have Revolut, but it doesn't seem to have an option for this. I guess I am open to ETFs, although I gather that their tax treatment is quite poor and they sound a bit ""synthetic"", like those CDOs from The Big Short (I'm not a financial expert, as you've probably gathered by now).
To be clear, I am not looking to invest in a coffee-adjacent business (Starbucks, coffee roasters, etc).

The next time I was supposed to come with my friends but they bailed on me and I just thought that if I go alone to do some homework and a coffee shop because that's normally what I do I will just hit two birds with a single Stone so that is what I did and I would work and from time to time when he is free he would come to talk to me and we were chat and I saw him as a really good guy the more he talks so when he asked me for my Instagram before I left I gave it to him
 
We started talking online And he turned out to be a very very good guy and I really like him but the problem was that he told me that he has a master in English studies and he talks to me in perfect English fluent even (my country 's third language is English) but when i ask him about his college experience he blew me off I'm going to ask him about his outfit on graduation he told me he wore something elegant and stoped at that so I got pretty doubtful about it 

so I asked my mom pretending that the story is not mine but my friends and she told me to just write him a message that is on the lines of my mom saw me talking to you and she got pretty sketchy about it so she asked me to tell her story and I told her story and she told me to ask you to show me your master's degree so I can be very much restful about my doubts he told me in which way do does he needs to prove to me and told him to just show me the the picture of the master's degree and he told me you turned out to be very much judgy and you think that I am lying to you and I told him that is just what she told me to do, he told me I understand and I didn't understand at first what he means by that so I so I told him to elaborate and he just told me may God be good with you in this life so I told him thanks with a question mark and he left me on read So my question is what do

A “no.” Someone slams a door in your face, you get the hint, and you move on. It’s neat, clean, and efficient. But as I’ve learnt, real failure doesn’t come with a neat bow on top, ready for you to tuck away. Instead, it feels like stumbling into a dark room you thought was empty, only to trip over a coffee table, crash into a chair, and slam into a wall. It’s not rejection—it’s chaos. It’s a mess. It throws you into disarray and makes you question everything you thought you knew.

I’ve become an expert at failing. Just ask anyone who’s been around long enough to see it unfold. I’ve watched my friends breeze through life like it’s a victory lap—gold medals at the Math Olympiad, acceptance letters from Caltech, MIT, and Stanford handed to them like morning coffee. It’s as if they’ve mastered this well-rehearsed dance, and the spotlight’s always on them. And here I am, feeling that sting—that quiet ache, like a paper cut. It’s small, but it never really goes away. I’ve been on the sidelines, admiring their success, while I’ve been fumbling to get my hands on what seems so effortlessly in their grasp. I’m fiddling with broken toys while they’re building rockets and quantum computers.

A lot of it comes down to me. To the hesitation I let paralyse me. To the times when I stand on the edge of something I want, but I can’t bring myself to jump—afraid of the fall, afraid of failure. It’s like standing at the edge of a cliff, too scared to leap but too curious to turn away. I get stuck in that paralysing fear—wondering if I’m even smart enough or good enough to try. Then, I look around. I see them—the ones who aren’t afraid. They leap. They push. They hustle. They run a marathon while I’m still trying to find my shoes. And I can’t help but wonder: Why am I not like that?

I remember the night my friend got into MIT. It was one of those late nights when everything slows down, the world seems to pause for a moment, just you and your closest friends, dreaming about the future. He opened that acceptance email right in front of me. His face lit up with that pure, unapologetic joy. I smiled, tried to force a smile. But all I could think about was my own rejection from Duke. I tried to be happy for him, but there was this voice in the back of my mind whispering, *""You’re not there yet. Maybe you never will be.""*

And that’s when it hit me—I’d never been good at packaging myself. I had no clue how to frame who I was for college admissions, to present myself as some perfect product—ready for their judgement like it’s a cake to be sliced. I thought I knew what it meant to write a great essay. I filled those words with carefully constructed reflections, polished anecdotes about leadership, perseverance, and creativity that I thought would dazzle even the most jaded reader. I thought I had the formula. I thought I was being smart and tactical. But the more I tried, the more cracks appeared. My stories of leading others, persevering through adversity—they all started to feel empty. I wasn’t leading anyone—not even myself. I was standing at the starting line, telling myself I was already ahead. The essays I thought would reveal my true essence just reflected someone who was trying too hard to be something I wasn’t. And every rejection letter made the cracks wider.

I’ve always been good at writing words. But I was never good at writing myself. I had built a story of who I wanted to be, but I forgot to live it.

I’ve lost a lot—competitions, money, friendships, time. I’ve made choices I can never undo. I thought I could juggle college classes, college admissions, a part-time job, research, and a long-distance relationship. I couldn’t. I pushed until I broke. Until the pieces of who I thought I was scattered across a thousand half-finished tasks, missed deadlines, and empty promises.

I’ve come to realise that maybe I’m not cut out for this. Maybe I’m not cut out for the dream I thought was mine. And owning that truth? It's another paper cut. It’s easy to want to quit. To stop trying, to step away from everything. After all, there’s always someone smarter, faster, younger, more passionate, or more creative. They have the drive. They have the stories. They’re already winning. What do I have? Four admissions seasons of “We regret to inform you.” Four seasons of “not good enough.”

And yet, here I am, still wondering—was it worth it?

Maybe the difference between me and those who made it isn’t that they tried harder. Maybe it’s that they held on longer. Maybe they triumphed in ways I couldn’t even imagine. Or maybe they just knew how to navigate the chaos better than I did. Maybe they didn’t crumble under the pressure. Or maybe they just didn’t mind the mess. I don’t know. But at some point, I have to ask myself: What if all this time, I’ve been tripping over the wrong coffee tables? Playing the wrong game?

When I somehow landed a job as an SAT tutor with my 1500, teaching youthful high schoolers, there’s a part of me that wants them to achieve everything, to win big, to rise above and say “fuck you” to the system, to stand tall in the 1%. That part of me walks 5 km every weekend to that cold classroom. But there’s another part of me, much bigger, that knows the truth—they’ll end up just like me: one of the 99% of applicants, rejected, overlooked. And then there’s the part of me, closer to my conscience, that wonders why I’m even there. Because I failed. And because, in my failure, I’m afraid I’ll drag them down too. But the manager said that’s exactly why they hired me—to teach them how to keep going despite all of that. I didn't buy it.

This title not a clickbait, I just wanna to tell my experience, and I hope this help somebody. 

I try to be short. Sorry my English, I'm from Russia. 
My doctor recommend me to try medicine for my stamina. Sometimes I feel so tired, and he say what I should try Meldonium. It's a medicine, what blocks something in cells, some metabolism thing, you can google it, and cells and body have more oxygen, and you feel more natural power. I try it, it's feels so great, for sport, and work, I feel mooore less tired and have so many power. 

AND

I noticed, what I'm like almost stop stuttering!
It's so strange, you're so calm, but not sleepy, I thing it's oxygen effect. And this feeling, scared, when you want to talk someone, it's gone. 

For me it's like very hard, to talk someone in the street, sometimes I can't say a word. But with Meldonium I feel like I'm a normal person. I can go to coffee shop and calmly said, Cappuccino and caramel syrup. Who stuttering, knows what letter C is hardest 😃. And my stuttering gone like on 80-90 %. I'm just like calmly speaking person, and sometimes I have little s-s-ttuter but it really almost gone. I can start a dialog, with zero stutter, ask a girl on street. It's crazy! I'm so glad about it. I don't know how, but it works. I use minimum doze - 250 mg. Just one pill in the morning. But recommend 2 , but for me 1 pill is good enough. 

If you try it and it helps you, I glad to hear your opinion. Meldonium in Russia it's no recipe drug. I don't know if this available in other countries. I know in sports it's like a doping, because who use it have better result. And our beautiful tennisist, Maria Sharapova use it too as well. I still thing it's some oxygen thing in a brain. 

Thank you, I hope it help somebody. Be careful with medicine, ask your doctor before this. It can have a side effects, and read instructions. God bless you all, ask your questions if you want, I try to answer.

This can vary based on the type of coffee bean, the brewing method, and the coffee-to-water ratio used.**

Coffee lovers often seek that perfect, powerful cup to kickstart their day. But what makes one coffee stronger than another? Understanding the factors that contribute to coffee strength can help you find the most potent brew. From robusta beans to specialized brewing techniques, each element plays a critical role.

In this blog post, we will explore what defines the strongest coffee. You’ll learn how different aspects, from bean type to preparation, impact the overall strength of your cup. Whether you need an extra boost or are just curious, this guide will uncover the secrets behind the strongest coffee.

# Types Of Coffee Beans

When it comes to finding the strongest coffee, understanding the types of coffee beans is essential. Coffee beans come in various varieties, each with unique characteristics that affect flavor, aroma, and caffeine content. In this blog post, we will explore the main types of coffee beans and how they contribute to the strength of your coffee.

# Arabica Vs Robusta

Arabica and Robusta are the two most common coffee beans. Each has distinct qualities that make them unique.

* Grown at higher altitudes
* Smoother, sweeter taste
* Lower caffeine content
* More expensive
* Higher acidity

Arabica beans are known for their delicate flavor. They often have hints of fruit and sugar. They are generally used in specialty coffee.

* Grown at lower altitudes
* Stronger, more bitter taste
* Higher caffeine content
* Less expensive
* Lower acidity

Robusta beans are favored for their strong, bold flavor. They have twice the caffeine content of Arabica beans. This makes them popular in espresso blends.

Here’s a quick comparison table:

|Feature|Arabica|Robusta|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Altitude|High|Low|
|Taste|Smooth, sweet|Bitter, strong|
|Caffeine|Lower|Higher|
|Price|Expensive|Cheaper|
|Acidity|Higher|Lower|

Understanding the differences between Arabica and Robusta helps in choosing the right bean for your taste and caffeine needs.

# Other Bean Varieties

Besides Arabica and Robusta, there are other lesser-known coffee beans. These beans offer unique flavors and strengths.

* Grown in West Africa and Southeast Asia
* Rare and unique taste
* Floral and fruity notes
* Lower caffeine content

Liberica beans are less common but have a distinct flavor profile. They are often used in specialty blends.

* Grown in Southeast Asia
* Complex, tart flavor
* Medium caffeine content
* Often blended with other beans

Excelsa beans are known for their unique taste. They add depth and complexity to coffee blends.

Here’s a comparison of these lesser-known beans:

|Feature|Liberica|Excelsa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Region|West Africa, Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia|
|Taste|Floral, fruity|Complex, tart|
|Caffeine|Lower|Medium|

Exploring these other bean varieties can enhance your coffee experience. Each type offers a unique flavor profile and strength.

# Brewing Methods

What is the strongest coffee? This question sparks many debates among coffee lovers. The brewing method plays a crucial role in the strength of your coffee. Let’s explore some popular brewing techniques and how they contribute to making the strongest coffee.

# Espresso Techniques

Espresso is known for its bold flavor and high caffeine content. The process of making espresso involves forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans at high pressure. This method extracts maximum flavor and caffeine in a short time.

Key points to consider when making a strong espresso:

* **Grind size:** Use a fine grind for better extraction.
* **Water temperature:** Ideal temperature is around 90-96°C (195-205°F).
* **Pressure:** Use 9 bars of pressure for optimal results.

Here’s a quick comparison of espresso techniques to achieve a strong brew:

|Technique|Details|
|:-|:-|
|Single Shot|Uses about 7 grams of coffee, yields around 30 ml of espresso.|
|Double Shot|Uses about 14 grams of coffee, yields around 60 ml of espresso.|
|Ristretto|Uses the same amount of coffee as a single shot but with half the water, resulting in a more concentrated flavor.|

Experiment with these techniques to find your perfect strong espresso. Remember, consistency is key. Use a good quality espresso machine and maintain it well to ensure the best results.

# French Press Secrets

The French Press is another popular method for brewing strong coffee. It allows the coffee grounds to steep in water, extracting rich flavors and high caffeine content.

To brew a strong French Press coffee, follow these steps:

1. Use a coarse grind for your coffee beans.
2. Preheat the French Press with hot water.
3. Add coffee grounds to the French Press (use a ratio of 1:15, coffee to water).
4. Pour hot water (around 93°C or 200°F) over the grounds.
5. Stir the mixture and place the lid on the French Press.
6. Let it steep for 4 minutes.
7. Press the plunger down slowly and serve immediately.

Here are some tips to enhance the strength of your French Press coffee:

* **Use fresh coffee beans:** Freshly roasted beans provide better flavor and strength.
* **Increase the coffee amount:** Use more coffee grounds for a stronger brew.
* **Adjust steeping time:** Let it steep longer for a bolder taste, but be cautious of over-extraction, which can make the coffee bitter.

By mastering these secrets, you can enjoy a strong and flavorful French Press coffee. It’s a simple method that delivers robust results.

# Caffeine Content

Coffee lovers often seek the strongest brew for that much-needed energy boost. The strength of a coffee can be measured in various ways, but the most common is its caffeine content. Caffeine is the magic ingredient that provides the alertness and energy many people crave. But what determines the caffeine content in your cup? Let’s explore this in detail.

# Comparing Different Brews

The caffeine content in coffee can vary significantly depending on the type of brew. Different brewing methods extract caffeine differently. Here’s a look at some common types of coffee and their typical caffeine content:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (per 8 oz)|
|:-|:-|
|Espresso|64 mg|
|Drip Coffee|95 mg|
|French Press|107 mg|
|Cold Brew|200 mg|

Cold brew tops the list with the highest caffeine content. This method uses cold water, steeping coffee grounds for an extended period, typically 12-24 hours. This long extraction time results in a higher caffeine concentration.

**Espresso** is often perceived as the strongest, but it contains less caffeine per serving than drip coffee or French press. Its strength comes from the concentration, as it’s usually consumed in smaller quantities.

**Drip coffee** is the most common brewing method and offers a balanced caffeine content. It’s a good choice for those seeking a moderate caffeine boost.

# Factors Affecting Caffeine Levels

Several factors influence the caffeine content in your coffee. Understanding these can help you choose the right brew for your caffeine needs:

* **Type of Coffee Bean:** Arabica beans contain less caffeine than Robusta beans. If you want more caffeine, opt for Robusta.
* **Roast Level:** Contrary to popular belief, light roasts have more caffeine than dark roasts. The roasting process reduces the caffeine content.
* **Grinding Size:** A finer grind increases the surface area, allowing more caffeine to be extracted. Coarser grinds yield less caffeine.
* **Brewing Time:** Longer brewing times extract more caffeine. This is why cold brew, with its extended steeping time, has such high caffeine content.
* **Water Temperature:** Hotter water extracts caffeine more efficiently. However, extremely hot water can also lead to a bitter taste.

By considering these factors, you can tailor your coffee brewing process to achieve the desired caffeine level. Whether you prefer a strong, concentrated espresso or a smoother cold brew, understanding these variables allows you to make an informed choice.

Experiment with different beans, roast levels, and brewing methods to find your perfect cup. Remember, the strongest coffee is not just about caffeine content; it’s about finding the right balance that suits your taste and needs.

I didn't think the in game voice help or instructions helped me understand what I was actually meant to be doing in lockdown mode so I did spend a bit of time researching and watching videos on how to do better, I am going to list below the main objectives and help if going for those legend cars. If I'd known the points below sooner I would have less hours played!

* Straight off the bat I think the first step is understanding the car classes if you have jumped straight to multiplayer and not the story. The lowest class (slowest) is class B and highest class (fastest) is S+. The classes are B, A, A+, S & S+. You will start off in class B with whatever B class you have in your garage. You cannot use a faster car until the next class has been unlocked (next point below) Story and Multiplayer garages and money are both separate. Gaining lots of money online is way easier than story mode so if you are struggling with a very slow car to begin with you could easily upgrade this after your first couple of games. A trick I used - say I was class B, I would modify that car until it was borderline A class and equip it. This way when I start my next game I am already in the fastest B class I can get. I found that if you do not equip the right car before a match, the game will automatically select one for you. If you don't have the necessary car the game will give you a 180SX. I found that 90% of the time when you're choosing a car before the match it gives you under 10 seconds to chose - this is why if you equip you're fastest car of that class first then the match will start you off in that car. If you start a match and instantly want a faster car there are cars you can 'jack' or switch out for the car you have so you can use this. Whatever class you are in, again lets say B, there will be B, B+ and sometimes A when starting out, or the longer you stay in the match, the heat level will increase so the cars you can jack are a higher class.
* The ONLY way to complete a lockdown session is to get on/extract the truck that spawns in every so often. The reasons to get on this is to keep what you have obtained in that match. The car you're in, money earned and class. When you successfully get on the truck you are automatically upgraded to the next class, so from B up to A. Allowing you to use a faster car next time - so again I would modify a car until it is borderline A+ class so it is the fastest A class in that match so there will be no point in jacking another car and spend your time going for a bike or those lockups!
* The bike. The bike is a lockdown vehicle only, so you cannot purchase or upgrade. The only way to obtain this is to grab it during a match. These bikes spawn 10-15 seconds BEFORE a lockup has been opened. Always keep your eye on the mini map as these pop up and stay on the map until collected - remember its a cross platform game so you are not alone! Doesn't matter what car or class you are in, the bike can always be grabbed if you get there first. The reason for a bike is because once you get to the lock up you have to pay $100,000 to get in if you're in a car. but if you have a bike you can literally ride straight in through the bike sizes yellow gates on the side of the lockup.
* A trick I was doing was generally collecting money around the map in whatever car class I was in waiting for a bike to spawn. As soon as the bike appeared on the map I would race to it. If I got it or not then by that time the lockup would be open so it's another race to this to see what is inside. If you get the bike, inside the lock up first this is a win win win because 1. You have the bike 2. Can easily access lockups and 3. If you're there first you get first dibs on the vehicle inside and the X2 big cash crates inside. If you didn't get the bike then you will have a bit of money already gathered from the start so it's just a case of finding more money on the way to the lockup because you never know, some people who are on their last few blacklist cars may leave what's inside!
* Something I didn't realise early on which I wasted a lot of time doing was jacking any car I seen around the map or just whatever was in the lockups thinking I was doing it right. ALL the blacklist cars have legendary liveries from the original NFS Most Wanted with private registration plates. For example: Vic's 2008 350Z has the original livery and 'VIC' on the plate. Don't get confused by NFS legendary custom cars as these too are upgraded, liveries and private plates which are also found in lockups - aim is to check out all the 15 blacklist cars on the web and correspond their name with the plate like I have stated with Victor. There are also stock NFS cars inside lock ups, these are only so if you extract with them, you can then purchase from the garage.
* Per game there are a total of 6 lockups to open. 3 are opened throughout the 30min time period but 3 you have to find yourself located randomly around the map. Due to these not being opened in the match these will cost the 100k to get inside but this is actually how I obtained most of my blacklist cars as no one was fighting me for it! These are available as soon as the game starts whereas the other 3 spawn throughout the match, the last lockup being usually about 12 minutes to go.
* If yourself, party member or other player gets in a rare vehicle it will have an orange wheel symbol on fire either next to their name or on the map - this means they are either in a stock NFS car, legendary customs or a blacklist car from inside a lockup. You can only damage and steal a one of these cars from a player that is not on your team. If this was your team they can only get downed and revived. Due to this info this means other players can see this also and if they see you in a car they need/want - watch out! If you get in a lockup car then grab some police/car traps asap just in-case.
* Back to the bike again. If you mange to extract on a bike you get to keep this for 24 hours from when you extracted. This is a great way of looting lockups as if you start on a bike you can enter the first lockup when it spawns so you have the upper hand. As I stated previous, since the bike is S+ class you will need to have extracted successfully to this class to use the bike, and again must choose the bike when choosing a vehicle pre-match - if you have time!
* If I was for whatever reason back to B class weather I was wrecked, busted or missed the extraction van, I would use all my best cars in the classes and grind with what car I had until reaching S+ where I would have no doubt extracted with a bike within that time and use the bike. With the bike chosen I would locate 7 or 8 lockups I knew would possibly spawn and on the way collecting money - so if I did find one with a car inside I wanted/needed I would leave a market on the map so if I went to collect money, I could return with 100k and open. If I couldn't find any I would find a quiet place on the map where no one else was and either chill or collect cash until the lockups were called out. Again, when I seen a bike spawn on the map I know 10-15 seconds later a lock up will open so I have my map at the ready to set a route to.
* Something I noticed and done a good amount of times is if you're panicking to extract the van and you are fighting for it, sometimes it's better to U-turn and wait for the next van as if you're in the green extraction zone and the other team gets it, the van will send out a huge EMP getting you busted and back to square one - I even had an instance where I must have been 100 yards driving the opposite away and it still got me.
* The easiest big cash to earn is speed traps - if your car is quick enough, then speed routes then speed zones. Then it would be cash inside the lockdown (red squares on the map) where this is heat level 5 and the cash inside can be from 12-15k. Also inside lockups as these are 15-30k. Daily challenges and contracts doesn't add to your in-game earnings.
* A lot of people think that the Razors M3 GTR blacklist #1 is the rarest car to find when actually they're different for everyone. The hardest 'rarest' car for me to find was Vic's 350z. This was my last car to find and had never seen it until I got it in the lockup in the 60+ hours I have into the game. Some matches can have duplicates of cars, similar cars constantly spawning which can be frustrating. A match I had not too long ago spawned 'Bull' twice back-to-back.

This is what I can remember so far! If I do remember anything I will update when I can. Any questions please don't hesitate to ask! If you've made it to this point thank you very much for reading, best of luck! James.

1iwcqyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kefir/comments/1iwcqyq/kefir_is_fixing_me/,Kefir is fixing me...,"during the pandemic, I found I'd been infected with lymes disease for nearly a year. I had to go on a strong round of antibiotics for an entire month, and it completely destroyed my gut biome. For the following years I'd have horrible GI issues, mood issues, always getting colds, brain fog... I felt like a shell of who I once was, as dramatic as it is to admit. Here is a list of some foods that made me sick:

\- Butter, whole grains & oatmeal, beans, ANY nightshade (tomato, onion, bell pepper, etc), red meat, some cheeses, strawberries, coffee, anything with pork fat in it... the list goes on.

I struggled with a lesser quality of life up until the beginning of last month, when I learned about kefir. I figured I was already screwed up, so trying fermentation for the first time couldn't hurt... lol

  
Holy MOLY this stuff changed my life!

It's done more for my mental and physical health than anything I've tried. Probiotics and yogurt helped a little bit, but the effects were temporary and I'd still get insanely sick after eating delicious stuff like tomatoes, onions, bell peppers- all of which are in my favorite foods. I still get a little funky if I eat a lot of what's listed above, but it's a far stretch from being doubled over and begging for death. 

I also notice my working memory is a lot better. I can recall things I need from the grocery store without checking the list 10 times. My husband noted that I seem quicker and in better moods. I am a decently anxious person, and I feel like kefir mellows me out more than SSRI's or ADHD meds ever did.

I'm really skeptical about ""super foods"" and all the touted benefits, but I do think kefir is one of them if you are an IBS queen like me.  

I feel worlds better... hell, I might go crazy later and eat a cherry tomato or two. The world is my oyster.

I'm a 43 F.  Could be perimenopause related, but I have pretty regular cycles at this point, 30-35 days.  

In the last few years my BMs are mostly just piles of small rocks as if I were a deer or rabbit instead of a human being.  I'm not ""constipated"" in the traditional sense because I go every day, at this point multiple times a day, practically every time I have to pee I also have to push out a few rocks.  It's maddening.  On a bad day the rocks are pebbles, on a good day they are bigger with some solid pieces.  I hardly ever have normal bowel movements anymore.

I drink plenty of water, my pee is almost clear.  I am mostly vegetarian and eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  I eat pretty high fiber although I've realized that a lot of foods don't have much fiber as you would think.  But I really try to get 10g per meal.  I eat berries every morning, oatmeal or chia pudding most days.  I also exercise generally 3-5 times a week although the last couple weeks I have only done 1-2 times.  It doesn't seem to make a difference.  

Lots of foods trigger GI distress for me - mostly anything with an excess of fats and cabbage and brussels sprouts, I have to really limit my portions with those because I get horrible cramping and gas.      


What I've tried: 

Magnesium citrate - I started taking this for stress/sleep and found it really helped without any negative side effects.  But it stopped working.  I'm taking 300mg a day and now it doesn't seem to make any difference.

Fiber gummies - horrible gas and bloating.

Miralax - gave me really bad cramps, but I think I'll try it again.

Prunes - cramping and gas

Probiotics - cramping and gas.  I can handle yogurt but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference on the days I eat it.

Coffee - I only drink occasionally but it used to help me have solid BMs, now it doesn't seem like it makes a difference.

Senna - I have taken it a few times, the first time it worked a little too well.  The second time it worked nicely.  The third time it didn't seem to work that well.  

Linzess - my doctor put me on 145 mcg.  I tried it for a week.  My poop was still rocks, if anything it was in even smaller pieces than usual, but I felt more urgency to go so I was going to the bathroom constantly to try and get the rocks out.  It also gave me horrible gas which was super embarrassing.  So if anything it made me feel worse. I stopped taking it.  I don't go back to see my dr until April but I know he's going to tell me to take a higher dose.  So I've considered just taking 2 pills for a week and see what happens but I'm afraid.

He also told me to try dairy free.  I haven't been able to do it yet because I need to do a lot of advanced planning and try to find substitutes.  It's also hard because I have kids who eat quite a lot of dairy and I  don't have time to prep separate meals all the time.   ",2,1740324896.0,Constipation,1,1.0,False

1iwcqdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_China/comments/1iwcqdh/exploring_the_opportunities_and_challenges_of/,Exploring the Opportunities and Challenges of Doing Business in China 🌏🇨🇳,"I’ve been diving deep into the world of international business lately, and one market that keeps grabbing my attention is **China** . With its massive population, rapidly growing economy, and increasing global influence, it’s hard not to see why so many businesses are eager to tap into this market. But as with any opportunity, there are challenges too. I wanted to share some insights and open a discussion about doing business in China; what works, what doesn’t, and how companies can navigate this complex yet rewarding landscape. 

# Why China?

1. **Huge Consumer Base** : China has over 1.4 billion people, making it the largest consumer market in the world. If your product or service appeals to even a small fraction of this demographic, the potential for growth is enormous. 
2. **Rapid Technological Advancements** : From e-commerce giants like Alibaba and [JD.com](http://JD.com) to cutting-edge tech companies like Huawei and Tencent, China is at the forefront of innovation. Businesses looking to partner with or learn from these leaders have plenty of opportunities. 
3. **Government Support for Foreign Investment** : While regulations can be strict, the Chinese government actively encourages foreign investment in certain sectors through policies like free trade zones and tax incentives.

# Challenges to Consider

1. **Cultural Differences** : Understanding local customs, business etiquette, and consumer preferences is crucial. What works in Western markets might not resonate with Chinese audiences. For example, social media platforms like WeChat play a much bigger role in daily life compared to Facebook or Twitter. 
2. **Regulatory Environment** : Navigating China’s regulatory framework can be tricky. Intellectual property protection, data privacy laws, and compliance requirements require careful attention. Companies need to ensure they’re following all rules while maintaining their competitive edge. 
3. **Competition** : The competition in China is fierce, both from local players and other international brands. Standing out requires creativity, adaptability, and a deep understanding of the market.

# Success Stories

Some companies have cracked the code when it comes to succeeding in China: 

* **Starbucks** , for instance, tailored its offerings to fit local tastes by introducing tea-based drinks and creating unique store experiences. Today, it's one of the most popular coffee chains in the country. 
* **Tesla** built a manufacturing plant in Shanghai, allowing them to produce vehicles locally and avoid high import tariffs. This move helped them significantly boost sales in the region.",1,1740324868.0,Business_China,0,1.0,False

I feel really good. Lot of energy. Been waking up earlier and more awake in the mornings. My inflammation has gone down drastically and I have the bloodwork to prove it. I’ve gone up in strength at the gym and overall just feeling great. 

Here’s the problem. Not only has my weight loss suddenly stalled but it’s creeping back up. And I just don’t know what to do. Like I said at the top I’m up to 177lbs. I’m trying not to freak out but I genuinely don’t understand why this is happening. It’s been almost 3 weeks since I’ve been at the low weight and this morning I was up 1.5lbs from yesterday. I understand weight fluctuations and water weight and all that. But a 3 week stall makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong. 

I do strength training about 3-4 times a week. I lift on the heavier side for a girl and have a good amount of muscle. I also play pickleball at least 5x a week. 
For food every single morning I’m eating around 3-4 ounces of ground beef and 3 eggs with a table spoon of butter. I have coffee with a table spoon on heavy cream. For lunch I usually will eat later around 3 or 4. So depending on how the day goes I may only eat 2 meals. If it’s 2 meals I’ll have something a little heavier like a ribeye or New York strip with butter. Maybe 2 table spoons of butter. If I have a 3rd meal it might be 2 eggs and some ground beef. Similar to breakfast but less food. I drink bone broth with salt and salt all my food. I take electrolytes and drink a lot of water throughout the day. I generally don’t track but I have the last few days and I’m getting around 1600-1700 cals a day and I’ve lost weight on that before many times. 

If I do have to eat out I will usually get chicken wings. No sauce. Just dry rub. Or BBQ pulled pork or brisket from somewhere with a pit. 

I think that’s everything. Trying not to leave anything out but if anyone has any ideas of what I can do differently or if I just need to be patient. But I’m really getting in my head about this and thinking about quitting this diet which I really don’t want to do because of the benefits I’ve had so far and I just genuinely enjoy it.

Talking about “tender mercies,” here’s what happened this morning:

• Woke up late. 
• One kid spilled breakfast all over themselves. 
• Another kid proceeded to tell me none of her shoes fit. 
• Makeup/hair/outfit was not jiving this morning. 
• Had my oldest jump out of the car to grab our coffee shop order. (Politely) got fussed at for not parking fast enough. 
• New barista at the shop. My usual was undrinkable.
• Forgot my kid’s morning medication. Had to head back home. 
• Almost hit another car backing into a spot inside the church parking lot and held up the incoming line.
• Ultimately late. Missed raising our hands to show appreciation for my husband’s service to the ward (helped him on his way out, hard to deny the bad when you’re seeing behind the curtain) 

Obviously, the Lord didn’t want me making it to church today /s. The kids and I are leaving after sacrament while my husband stays behind to help the new guy transition.

Has this new selection of hymns been posted yet? Extremely interesting. Heavy emphasis on Christ/Christianity, no uniqueness to Mormonism. Whereas you go through the current hymn book, and it’s much more “prophet, prophet, Joseph, Zion, Saints, Latter-days, prophet, prophet, prophet.”

1iwcc0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1iwcc0l/budgeting_and_phasing_out_ride_shares_for_public/,Budgeting and phasing out ride shares for public transit so I can start funding my first car.,"I’m ready to save for a car.

Each month I spend $400 in ride share (Uber and recently Lyft). Between January 1- February 23 (incl pending transactions from this weekend) I spent $560 (rounded trips up to nearest $ to keep calculations easy) and that’s including the strong attempt to utilize public transit.

Admittedly, my fear overwhelmed my ability to take public transport as I was not trusting that I am safe. Now that I have goals I want to prioritize in a “growth mindset”, I’ve been practicing taking the bus more in the past week (3-4x) saving $80

I use ride share to go to/from work, groceries, outings with friends on weekends. When I am out with friends we normally offset paying or e-transfer whoever is ordering their percentage to cover.


Work = 40-42 rides per month
- this months challenge as of Feb 23rd: 25 rides and 7x public transit

- Goal: Start mornings earlier so I’m not in a rush/miss the bus, preplan bus route to depart after that days shift is over, having a snack after work/socializing to uplift myself; when I feel super drained I think to myself I just need to get home, reminding myself of the goal; an extra 30 minute commute is a sacrifice I’m willing to take to get to a place where I can afford my first car. I don’t expect it to work perfectly right away so I’m trying a variety of approaches to work on my time management and self car. I’m finding it’s easier to bus to work than from right now.


Groceries = 4 rides per month (biweekly grocery trip to Walmart; toiletries, household, cleaning and food all in one

- Goal: Public transit there (empty handed) then Lyft home


Outings with friends = 4 rides per month (go out weekly but friends cover other weeks or split bill)

- Goal: Ask for a local monthly meetup (local sledding hill/my place/coffee shop around the corner)

This weekend to visit a friend in another city I used Lyft ($26 instead of $42 with Uber) and I’m proud of that decision. I took the train and bus home too to save ~$20+ back.

I plan to load my bus pass this month I am not sure if I should do the monthly unlimited use for $96 or put an allocated amount ($40) to determine if I can use up the credits first in my challenge.

I’m struggling with convincing myself ride share is a necessity when it’s a luxury, I’m hindering my savings/care in other areas to ensure I have ride shares as a safety net, but I really think I’m growing enough to phase it out, I just don’t know what’s reasonable and realistic. 

Right now the calculation is 23% of my take home pay per month is put towards ride share on avg.(Uber only up until this weekend change to Lyft).

I do not know much about cars, budgeting for a used reliable vehicle, parking space rental at apartment, maintenance, fuel, insurance and other unexpected unknown costs is very overwhelming to me and I’m not sure where to start so I just chose a $5k goal with something to look forward to.

My plan is to put what I save from reducing ride shares and taking the bus towards a car fund. I’m not willing to use emergency fund to expedite this process at this time.

Is there anything in my plan that could be tweaked to be more realistic? Can you share anything I’m misinformed or naive about when saving for a first car/its expenses?

TIA

Last night I got anxious and fell down a google rabbit hole… 

I am 10w6d as of today and after a day of packing up my house I started to get a little suspicious of my sudden health. I had horrible food aversions and sickness for the past 3 months and even ended up taking myself to the ER this past Tuesday as the exhaustion was draining me and it felt wrong so I was very worried as it was abnormal compared to my first. 

They told me (thankfully) that I am simply just pregnant, my hormones were fluctuating as I was 10 weeks having the baby switch to the placenta for nutrients and suggested I eat more throughout the day as my blood sugar was a bit low. I followed instructions and have felt a lot better since snacking throughout the day but my anxiety has me thinking horrible thoughts. My loss of nausea and food aversions came soooo suddenly, it’s like it never happened… 

Yesterday when I awoke I was a bit sore in my hips and crampy but put it all to gas and constipation. I ended up passing gas and using the bathroom yesterday quite a bit after 2 cups of coffee which I was relieved to but by the end of the day I couldn’t help but worry.

Is this common to lose the aversions and sickness so suddenly? It’s been so long since I was last pregnant I forget.

I have awoke with headaches the past 3 days however so I suppose that is a symptom to take note of and I’ve had no spotting this pregnancy. 

My dr’s appointment and next ultrasound is March 10th, the ER in my town is very logged up and I want to avoid going in if I can. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be worried? Am I just over worrying as I experienced my first pregnancy loss ever prior to this pregnancy? When did you start feeling better?",1,1740323210.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/6fpfmhw7pwke1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=a625a809f2a2a3e324e59ad679385f3563193512

  
  
The story:  
So, as someone almost fulltime into instant coffee (that too lavista extra strong! So you know my standards are way lower than the average joe) I got into brewing coffee myself. I hate to just change a part of my life style like getting just the mokapot and then getting grinded beans? naah uh, I want to sit and grind them beans myself.

So the grinder used is Agaro's manual grinder (https://amzn.in/d/fmBfhST).  Now a friend told me that for a mokapot, you should use coarse grinds so I would grind at settings 6. (I have no clue how this is measured and standed in terms of exact units but I know its half of the fine grind setting that my grinder can do. Please bear with me and teach me haha).

For mokapot, again we have the agaro mokapot (https://amzn.in/d/3GUN6vL).  
Now key things to note:

YOUR POT'S ELASTIC BAND SHOULD BE PROPERLY PUT IN PLACE AND YOUR POT MUST BE TIGHTLY CLOSED.  
I swear I have burnt my hand with steam so many times (another mistake I will talk about) that it isn't even funny now.

Now for the beans, the first time I got Kaefido Bettadamalali (https://www.kafeido.com/products/bettadamalali-estate-36-hrs-aerobic-washed-medium-roast) and boy, it was mid. Mostly, I would like to blame myself for how I handled the pot and how I made the coffee but still the brew was mid and I'd like to say that. The beans were grinded at settings 6 of my grinder. The pot was giving out steam from the side (an issue I repeatedly did) The heat given to the cup was at MAX. and well a disaster overall.

I did this 3-4 times and then realised, that the heat should be at the lowest possible setting. So yeah there is that. **HEAT MUST BE LOW.**

Now, I'd also let it brew till I heard gurgling sounds from my pot. and till it started to show basically the blondest coffee coming out from the stem. Don't do this

Now if you are indian enough like me and don't have an induction, you'd try to keep this on the stove, right? Make sure to have some kind of utensil to actually let the pot sit on the gas instead directly trying to balance it on 2-3 stands of the stove and disturbing the pot now and then. this is an issue. I'd keep it directly on top of the stove instead of leaving some gap which meant fire not getting enough oxygen and it going off or maybe just badly made brews. Don't hold it constantly, you WILL disturb the steam coming out resulting to a shit brew.  Again rookie mistake I did for the past 3 months and had shit brews.

Now now now, changed the beans and got **Lavazza Gusto Crema** (https://amzn.in/d/9MF5dCo). Someone said its a 5/10 beans but in my opinion, if the bar is set so low by you when it comes to coffee, I think its a fine quality beans for a beginner. Like come on, you can't expect the beginner to understand what the difference between shit and good is. They'd go with the most generic ones instead of trying out le speciality that alot of brewers like.

Grinded it at 6 as usual. and I made sure that the pot is closed properly, got a stand for the stove to keep the pot above the gas burner. and well behold, a somewhat better brew.

But still not happy with my brew :|

So, I looked at my grinded beans and noticed it would form lumps and I didn't care much about those, so eh eh eh maybe thats a problem! I take a fork and just roughly break this lumps and then evenly put it into the moka pot coffee container.

a even better brew and good enough to keep me happy.

BUT BUT BUT BUT  
**WE NEED TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING BETTER TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE**

I decide to not listen to my friend and instead of the coarsest grind, I go a notch down to 5, but like I said why step things up by just 1 step, lets move to 4. Its the middle point (or closer to it) and it would be a change significant enough to bring a difference.  
Start grinding as usual, grinded a bit more than usual and once that was done, took my hand dandy fork to break the lumps and then prepared the pot.

Water preboiled to boiling bloop bloop temperature. Don't expect the noobie to have thermostats or weighing machines. so ""andaaz pe chalenge"".  
Coffee beans were about enough to not have more after being tapped down into the container.

We get to brewing, lowest possible heat level. and don't touch it.

I stopped as soon as it started to get a bit blonde. and then stopped the brewing by putting the pot under running water and taking out the extract into a cup. Took out 4 spoons for my sibling and then added water to the remaining one to achieve what you see in the image.  
FREAKING LOVED IT.

So this was it, my beginner experience to brewing coffee and I learnt from fuccking around and finding out. I hope this helps you guys out and you guys telling me about the units that are used and what all can I improve about the whole brewing process or different beans. Hopefully also a fun read for ya all :D

But that was not the only thing I liked because my boyfriend said he wanted to give bible courses to kids and the church asks for a mandatory police report to see if you are mentally stable to stay with kids and avoid anything we know shouldn't happen. 

Overall it was really emotional, with no judgment about people and other churches and religions, people prayed for themselves at the same time, no books to read and spit automatically like robots, the staff welcoming you etc. Such a good experience actually.

Apologetic for no reason. He is clearly not feeling too well. And a bit high. But he asks out of genuine care first, “How are you?” You know what he is asking. He wants to know if you have been successful, if you have traveled, if you have stopped coping with things like drugs and sex. My younger self then apologizes for creating bad habits, for not knowing better, and for letting themselves get so low. All of this before I can even respond.

“It is not your fault,” I say. “We have learned from all of the experiences we have had, like surviving unhealthy relationships, unsafe experiences, and making plenty of mistakes.” He smiles, a smile that you can tell is genuine. A smile purely meant for only the two of you, no one else.

“We are married to an incredibly smart, creative, hardworking, loving, and beautiful soul,” you continue. “We have the most adorable daughter, who takes after the both of you and who looks up to you so much. And we no longer cope with negative habits.” His smile gets bigger and even more genuine.

“We have discovered what it means to be alive, we have separated our worth from our work, and we have discovered that love is superior to everything else. Love for ourselves, love for others, and love received.” His weight shifts to a more relaxed position. His fidgeting lessens. His face softens.

“You can be yourself. You deserve that. You can forgive yourself. You deserve that. You can let go of the past and of the people who have hurt you. You deserve that,” I say.

He asks quietly, “Family?”

You respond, “They exist, but not in your life. And that is okay. It is better that way. Besides, we have created our own family. One of love and peace, not anger and guilt.”

He asks, “And you are happy with just your little family? It feels like we always imagined?”

“Even better than we could have imagined,” I respond. “The meaning of life feels like something so far from what we imagined in the best possible ways. The things we value are love, partnership, morals, parenthood, creativity, and exploration. And we experience those things within our little family every single day, as well as on our own.”

He smiles.

I say, “You did it. You deserve this life. And you are okay.”

He responds, “Thank you, I needed that more than you know.”

I say, “I know how much you needed that. You have always needed to hear that.”

I say, “Please take care of yourself, love yourself, hold yourself, and forgive yourself.”

We continue to drink our coffee, talking about all of the new things we would learn. All of the growth we would experience. All without spoiling the beautiful and not so beautiful moments to come.

He says suddenly, “Please do not forget to travel, try amazing foods, take rad photos, and seek greatness, however you decipher that last one.”

I respond, “I will not forget. We value those things as much as you always have. And we are planning a massive road trip at the moment. You will get to experience so much with the loves of your life. We cook and bake and eat wonderful foods all the time. And to your last point, we are working on a project that may very well help change lives.”

He smiles even wider.

“I am so proud of you,” he says quietly.

“And I am proud of you too,” I respond.

“I love you,” I say quietly.

“And this life is yours to live. Please do not consider ending it early. It can feel hard and empty at times, I know that. But once you realize the value and worth you bring to your partner, your daughter, and your friends, it all unfolds in the most terrific way.”

“Let life expand and envelop you.”

He replies, “I will try my best.”

And I know he means it.

We smile at each other, both of them genuine, finish our coffee, and say goodbye.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iwbyac,https://www.reddit.com/r/StationEleven/comments/1iwbyac/this_show_makes_me_feel_closer_to_god/,This show makes me feel closer to God.,"I finished *Station Eleven* about ten months ago, and I still don’t know how to talk about it. I’m writing this in a coffee shop, half-working on a paper, when “I’d Rather Go Blind” comes on, and suddenly, I have to fight the urge to cry. Just remembering the experience of seeing this show for the first time feels overwhelming.

It honestly baffles me that something like this was made by humans. It feels like a gift from the heavens—like it shouldn’t exist, and yet it does. I’m Unitarian Universalist, which means I don’t follow a strict doctrine, but I still believe in something I’d call “god.” Not a sentient being, necessarily, but a force that permeates existence—something fundamental, like gravity or radio waves. And the way I interact with this god, the way I *know* it exists, is through wonder.

The best way I can describe that feeling—the presence of god—is staring up at something so vast and incomprehensible that I can’t look away. It’s awe, but not just awe—it’s like my whole being is being fed by what I’m seeing, like for just a moment, I’m riding the wave of existence itself. That feeling is rare. I find it sometimes in the woods, when I can’t hear or see another soul. I’ve felt it at church during a particularly moving sermon. I felt it during my first kiss.

But this show—this show gives me that feeling in almost every second of it.

And part of that is exhilarating—because *humans* made this, not god. If people are capable of creating something that makes me feel this way, then how much more is out there? How much more could I find that brings me closer to the animate everything?

But part of it is devastating. No matter how much I think about it, write about it, or talk about it, I feel like I can only grasp maybe 50% of what’s there—what it means, what it makes me feel. Even writing this, it feels like I’m falling short.

I’ve never encountered another piece of art that pierces me this deeply. It’s truly wonderful. And it’s truly heartbreaking. What a gift it is to experience this! And what torture it is!

So I guess my question is—does anyone else feel this way about *Station Eleven*? And further, has anything else—any other book, show, song, or piece of art—ever come close to inspiring this feeling for you?",15,1740322739.0,StationEleven,12,0.76,False

1iwbxxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1iwbxxc/redcoffee_for_github_actions_a_viable_solution/,RedCoffee for GitHub Actions : A viable solution for CI/CD SonarQube Reporting,"# What does my project do?

RedCoffee is a CLI tool written in Python that helps developers generate detailed SonarQube code analysis reports in PDF format. This is particularly useful for teams using SonarQube Community Edition, which lacks built-in PDF report generation.

With RedCoffee for GitHub Actions, this process is further streamlined. By integrating RedCoffee into CI/CD pipelines, developers can automate report generation without worrying about manual execution. Simply add a block of code in your GitHub Actions YAML file, and the PDF report will be available in the artifacts section of GitHub Actions.

# My motivation behind building this project

I've talked about RedCoffee quite a few times on this sub before, and the response from developers has been pretty good. Many reached out with feature requests, and one of the most common was GitHub Actions integration. A developer + product owner pointed out that developers often prefer to access reports directly in the CI/CD pipeline, rather than running a separate tool.

That idea made sense. Automation should work for the developer, not the other way around.

# Using RedCoffee for Github Actions

Using RedCoffee for GitHub Actions is straightforward. We just need to add the following block of code in our actions.yaml file

    - name: Use RedCoffee for Github Actions
      uses: Anubhav9/redcoffee-for-github-actions@v1.4

# What is the underlying implementation?

The implementation follows a structured and reliable approach, leveraging Docker, PostgreSQL, and SonarQube to handle the reporting process. The action.yaml file, available in the repository, defines the workflow:

1. Checkout the code from the repository.
2. Create a Docker network to facilitate container communication.
3. Start a PostgreSQL database and configure the required environment variables.
4. Deploy SonarQube Community Edition and connect it to the database.
5. Wait for SonarQube to fully initialize, update credentials, and generate an API token.
6. Run SonarScanner to analyze the codebase.
7. Install RedCoffee from PyPi.
8. Run RedCoffee CLI to generate a SonarQube analysis report in PDF format.
9. Store the PDF report in the GitHub Artifacts section for easy access.

# Who is the target audience for this project?

* Developers & engineering teams using SonarQube Community Edition who need automated PDF reports.
* CI/CD engineers looking to integrate SonarQube reporting into their workflows.
* Indie hackers & open-source contributors interested in building their own GitHub Actions.

# Limitations for this project

Despite its capabilities, RedCoffee for GitHub Actions has a few known limitations:

1. Language Support – Python is fully supported. JavaScript mostly works, but occasional errors occur (a fix is in progress). Java and Go support are planned, pending further testing.
2. API Response Issues – Sometimes, the SonarQube API fails to respond on time, leading to report generation failures. A retry mechanism will be added in the next release.
3. SonarQube Community Edition Limitations – By default, SonarQube analysis runs only on the main/master branch. A workaround exists and has been tested, and it will be rolled out in a future update.

**Installing RedCoffee as Standalone CLI**

Goes without saying that if you want to use RedCoffee directly as a standalone CLI, please install it via Pypi. The command for the same is given below

    pip install redcoffee==1.8

Provided your analysis has been completed, you can use the following command to generate the PDF report

    redcoffee generatepdf --host=${YOUR_SONARQUBE_HOST_NAME} --project=${SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY} --path=${PATH WHERE PDF FILE IS TO BE STORED} --token=${SONARQUBE_USER_TOKEN}

**A request to fellow developers**

Building RedCoffee and integrating it into GitHub Actions has been a challenging but rewarding experience. If you find this project useful, consider starring the repository on GitHub.

2 competitors brewed at the same time with 8 sets to get through the 16 competitors. The final round consisted of 3 people. The top 2 scores of the first round and one wild card chosen on a randomiser.

No, we never had a spark or romantic feelings ever.","1.5 years ago, an old schoolmate joined my company and we accidentally met in the cafeteria. We were never friends or anything at school, maybe I spoke once or twice with her. But here in office, we stayed in touch and became friends. We worked in different teams in different floors, but we used to meet for coffee in the cafeteria once every month. 

Sometimes I would call her and other times she would call me to meet and have coffee. Although we used to meet only once a month, we used to enjoy out time hanging out for an hour or two - Cracking jokes on our company or managers, gossiping about old classmates, discussing work etc...

She's attractive, but I never had any romantic interest towards her and neither did she. She's 4 inches taller than me- maybe that was one of the reasons. 

I got married a few months ago. I invited her to the wedding, but she declined saying the location is far and she cant come alone at night. 

Since then, she has been acting distant. She is always giving excuses when I ask her to meet for coffee and says she will call me the next day but she never did. I thought maybe she's busy or something and stopped texting her. Before, if we saw each other at the lift or the gate, we used to stop and talk for a few minutes. But since my wedding, she just smiles, says hi and leaves in a hurry. Since 2 weeks, she doesn't even make eye contact and pretends ahe never saw me.

We were not lovers nor super close friends so it's not a big deal for me. But I am genuinely bewildered by her sudden change of behaviour.

I asked my friends why this could happen and some said she is sad that she's 34 and still not married. Some others suggested that she had feelings for me (I highly doubt this , beacuse I never felt that spark from either side and also she's a lot taller than me)

1iwbvq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceClubDiscussion/comments/1iwbvq6/interview_with_anton_a_screenwriter_of_advent_no_3/,"Interview with Anton A., screenwriter of Advent No. 3","Good day. Before the story came out, we asked Anton a few questions and now we are in a hurry to share the answers. Enjoy reading!

>1. Let's start with the most traditional question - how did you get into visual novels and RC in particular?

In RC – I simply offered my candidacy. Well, to be more specific, a long time ago, about six years ago, when I was working as an engineer, my beloved wife just started playing Visual Novels. I remember, as if it were yesterday, the story “Sails in the Fog”, the moment of the battle on the ships. The choice of what to shoot at the enemy – grapeshot or cannonballs, I think. I remember thinking – it must be great to work like this – to create interactive story-games, so that talented people would create visual design for them. After that, there was a long and varied path, which, in terms of professional activity, began for me with writing scripts for motivational children's audio plays based on the biographies of prominent historical figures. As for searching for specific places – everything was done through ads. And in the end, my story is about to be published in the Romance Club, which I am incredibly happy about. So, to some extent, my experience probably says that nothing is impossible.

>2. The news of your arrival in RC, without exaggeration, created a furor! And were you ready for such a flow of warm words and support from the players?

To be honest, I didn't expect it at all. I am very pleased that so many people remember me and speak so warmly of me. The support I have received is incredibly pleasant! What's more, I didn't expect that so many people know me.

>3. Tell us a little about yourself, what are your hobbies, what music do you listen to, do you have pets? (photos are welcome)

I am interested in writing different stories, first of all. I have exactly the case when a hobby turned into work, I like to read fantasy adventure mainly (for quite a long time after I became a professional author myself (meaning I started making money by writing) I did not read, because I was afraid that what I read would affect my own work, but now I have grown “plot armor”. I can work on a story, and in between read another one, without fear that what I read will affect my work. I love historical and scientific podcasts / videos on any topic. I rarely listen to music, actually. Basically, it's all 80s from heavy to pop. I have pets: This is a cat Manya, a Yorkshire terrier Styopa and, more recently, a cat Timofey. He, a week old, was brought to the door by his mother cat a few days before this New Year. For ten days we looked after Tim in half with his mother cat, then she decided that her son had matured enough, and we were reliable enough and went off into the sunset.

>4. Those who are familiar with the ""League of Dreamers"" app and your stories in it say that it is better not to go there without guides. Tell me, will your story in RC be as complex and variable? And how do you feel about guides in general?

It was an experiment, which is in the past. In the new story, I want to focus on the Lore and characters. I treat guides (and guide makers especially) with great respect and understanding. It's a lot of work, I couldn't do it myself, honestly. But I prefer to go through stories at random. After all, that's what variable stories are for, so that you don't know what will happen next depending on your decisions. On the other hand, many people want to know everything in advance in real life, and guides, even if they are in the game, give us this opportunity. After all, VN is, consider, a small, and sometimes very large, life.

>5. RC has recently become very fond of post-apocalyptic settings: HHW, PSI (although this is more of a dystopia, but there is also a post-apocalyptic setting outside the perimeter), HSR... Weren't you afraid to take on writing a story with a similar setting?

No. I haven't written it yet. And I'll do something my own way. Especially since I haven't read any of the above)

>6. What inspired you to write Advent? Any similar media, music maybe?

The most obvious answer on the surface is that the main reference was the Attack on Titan series. However, in fact, there is not much from the cult anime in the story, only the ""wrapper"", so to speak. The characters and the problems are different. Although, if desired, experts (who, by the way, are mostly much greater experts on AOT than me) will probably find many similar moments. Well, in general, the lore and history were developed for several months and, as usual, the world of the novel is much larger than the part of it that the player will see when reading.

>7. How many love lines are planned for AN3? 
>We know that we can't give spoilers before the stories are released, but can we give a tiniest spoiler? 🤏Describe each favorite in one word?

Six. But I would have made seven, since there was not enough room for one type. WORDS: Anger, Pride, Facade, Power, Fatigue, Wing. And I would have added: Shoulder.

>8. On a scale of 1 to 10, how nervous are you before going on AN3?

7, something like that.

>9. On the cover we can see a very, very beautiful main character. Who selected references for this gorgeous girl?

If we talk about the types of the heroine's face specifically, then I selected it. But my beloved wife helps me select the hairstyles, clothes, and even the faces of all the other characters, since in VN the female gaze is very important.

>10. Have you always worked with writing texts or was there work with some other, perhaps much more prosaic, specificity? Perhaps now there is some work besides game scriptwriter?

Not always. I worked as an engineer for most of my adult life. At one point, I ran a micro-company laying network cables (fiber optic, electrical) at industrial sites. But about six years ago, by chance, I started earning my first money as a screenwriter, and at the end of that year I finally gave up engineering, which I even returned to as an optional subject for a while. Now I do nothing but scripts. There is simply no time for anything else. As well as the desire.

>11. How long did it take you to choose the idea for the story? Did you choose this setting yourself, or was it a suggestion from management?

It was the result of long-term collaboration, so to speak. There was an initial idea, which we twisted and changed during the work. As a result, we got a universe with its own chronology, within which the story of ""Advent No. 3"" will be told.

>12. Many people have noticed similarities between your story and Attack on Titan, are you familiar with this anime?

Yes. I met it quite recently. But I can't say that I remember much from there.

>13. Besides RC, you are working on other projects, which is commendable. There is some excitement in the fandom about this, whether you will be able to handle three stories at once. Are all your current projects ""in-process"" or are some of them finished?

There are actually two stories I am writing right now (even one and a half, I would say). I can handle it – easily. It's not the first time for me.

>14. Do you enjoy writing fantasy more than other genres?

If by fantasy we mean science fiction in a broad sense. Definitely yes. This is the genre in which I feel most comfortable, which I have written a lot (both fantasy and science fiction). Although I also have extensive experience in creating horror stories. If we talk about what I cannot write - thrillers, especially psychological ones. What I would like to try is comedy everyday life (but I can't handle it, I think) and, perhaps, a detective story.

>15. Finally, what do you think players can take away from your story?

In fact, I do not claim any sacred truths. All the messages of the story are quite obvious. Together with the readers, we will reflect: what is the price of power and human life? What are we ready to do for the sake of a real goal? Is it possible to sacrifice what seems small for the sake of something greater?

We’re incredibly excited to share the vision and goals behind Bitcent ($BTCC), a token designed for the future of microtransactions and sustainable wealth creation for its holders. Bitcent was created to enable fast, secure, and low-cost online payments for content creators, online gaming, or even everyday transactions like buying a coffee. The ultimate goal is global adoption as a mainstream micropayment alternative and exchange listing on major platforms, aiming for a $1+ price target. We are more than just a cryptocurrency project; we're building a community focused on integrity and long-term value.

**Bitcent Project Brief**

* **Mission:** To pioneer microtransactions, providing a reliable, cost-effective, and lightning-fast payment solution. We believe that everyone should have the ability to participate in the digital economy without the burden of excessive fees or complicated systems.
* **Core Principles:** Fair launch with no pre-sale or insiders. Fully renounced ownership. Smart contracts verified. Transparency, security, and longevity. Fixed supply of 1 billion BTCC to ensure scarcity.
* **Trading Availability:** Currently trading on MoonShot DEX with an exciting migration to Raydium DEX upon reaching 432 SOL market cap. This milestone marks a significant step towards increased visibility and liquidity for Bitcent!

**Keys to Success: Strategy, Stability, and Shared Responsibility**

The successful launch and future of Bitcent hinge on the following critical factors:

* **Community Support:** Your enthusiasm, activity, and dedication are the backbone of the Bitcent project. Together we stand and united we prosper.
* **Patience:** Quick Rich schemes aren't feasible but in patience, wealth exists. With Bitcent patience pays you exponentially.
* **Migration to Raydium:** Reaching the 432 SOL threshold will lead Bitcent to gain access to significantly higher trade volumes as well as many new prospective holders
* **Strategic Holding:** The initial phase after migrating to Raydium is absolutely crucial. Many investors will be watching, analyzing whether the early MoonShot buyers will panic sell chasing minimal profits. Their observation decides to invest or turn to an easier catch
* **Responsible Profit-Taking:** This is where we, as a community, must act differently. We need to avoid any possibility of what everyone dreads on the crypto field, a Dump or Crash!
* **Strategic Mindset:** This is more about taking less for the most. Don't trade potential for money

**Strategic Success**

**Why Raydium Launch Strategy Matters:** Successfully navigating the Raydium launch will pave the way for whales, institutional, and smaller retail to enter safely. If early investors flash sold all the tokens bought for $100 after the listing for just hundreds then, they risk crashing it all together

**Real Wealth through Compound Growth: The Bitcent Goal**

Our vision extends beyond mere token price increases. We aim to demonstrate the power of compounding returns through strategic holding. The below estimates will paint how possible this can be and what potential this project beholds.

Let's illustrate the potential of holding Bitcent over time, starting with an initial investment of $100, and these averages are approximate values for reference:

* **MoonShot Average ($0.00003000):** $100 buys you approximately 3,333,333 BTCC tokens.
* **Price at $0.0003000:** Your $100 investment is now worth $1,000 (10x).
* **Price at $0.003000:** Your $100 investment is now worth $10,000 (100x).
* **Price at $0.03000:** Your $100 investment is now worth $100,000 (1000x).
* **Price at $0.3000:** Your $100 investment is now worth $1,000,000 (10,000x).
* **Price at $1.00:** Your $100 investment is now worth **$3,333,333!**

This showcases the incredible wealth creation potential with sustained growth and long-term holding. Patience is KEY

**The Responsibility of MoonShot Holders & Founders:**

To our MoonShot community members, we are building upon a legacy of transparency, accountability, fairness, and long-term commitment which means to act with it as well. We also, carry the responsibility of ""founding"" the Bitcent.

* **Stable momentum:** Stability starts with you! every strategic move you make impacts on its potential path to explode
* **Be the founders:** this journey, and success starts at our founders who you will also carry a huge decision for stability and volume of Raydium investors and future traders on whether we succeed on launching a proper reputation on the Solana chart

This community is like any other ""get rich quick"" one we need you, that despite failing so many times due to being manipulated by others and rugpull schemes! This project appreciates, rewards transparency and hard work! we ask this community to stay united and show the others that even little amount with a strong strategy, integrity can be worth thousands later if planned for long. and we value that vision by properly taking profit and coordinating through communities by holding responsibly and by taking advantage of future potentials,

**Strategic Profit Taking (The 5% Rule) post Raydium Migration:**

After Bitcent makes the giant leap into Raydium: patience plays key role here and we need you that most. avoid flash selling tokens chasing pennies but take responsibility into securing and securing. Avoid initial dumping tokens. Do not chase minor profits, for this will trigger panic selling among the group

The objective is to create organic momentum Once the momentum builds by time with constant flow. then take 5% profit far from time high for minor dips with decent support!  
(and a 5% loss you panic!)

Avoid selling after its trending. we want you all here with more gains here the gains would grow larger after the Raydium Launch, if there won't be major red flags to the people watching on that new market stage, the project gains traction on its first few momentum for buyers to invest with integrity, and traders and exchanges can have proper chart review with stable base on tokenomics stability and credibility and momentum!

Remember that decentralized finance is not a solitary venture, it's a shared endeavor towards a more equitable, user-centric financial future. By holding and following profit strategics on this plan. by staying put! We are united by commitment to transparency, we can build a secure more prosperous economy. A wealth creator!

**Let's rise up! Join the Bitcent community! together with this Bitcent project.**

**Thank You**

I had stopped praying as i got upset for falling terrible ill and all the repercussions it had on my life in my formative yrs in high school. This person was a god to my family. I didnt improve. So i stopped worshipping and praying to his photo/idol or visiting his place of worship. I let my family continue and asked them i dont want to curb their freedom of expression just keep me away from it. Unless and until i get some experience of his intervention i wont pray or visit him. 

Covid happened and my mom got it. She wasnt recovering and i started to pray to entity called “god”, not him my guru. I got a dream of him with him saying nothing feels sure of my mother asking me wat to do. I woke up crying i was in my early 20s mind u. I told my mom and after few days she recovered after we almost losing her. I tho8 my guru saved my mom. Then a couple of yrs later i planned my career switch thru masters abroad. I gave my GRE despite not compulsory without coaching. I scored below my target gave it again and it was fine. I also wrote my own essays although English is not my first language as I cudnt afford to pay to consultancies. ChatGPT was not a thing in 2021. I started praying to my guru and god w/o my family’s knowledge on my building’s terrace. I prayed for my future and my family’s fortune to change. Of all applications i got only one admit. I tho8 my guru listened to my prayers and now the loan and visa procedures were supposed to be cleared. I prayed. Loan got cleared, buffer amt for interview was built like superfast despite i and my sister had limited funds. The visa interview too was a miracle for me as the guy who interviews was infamous for 90% rejects. This was a moment. I confessed to my mom, it was cuz of my guru that everything has happened. My mom was relieved to hear those words as over last 10 yrs she was harping on, “One day u will come back to that guru and u will worship him again.” I guess her prayers were answered. Before flying i visited his place of worship took blessings and flew. I was also surprised to know b4 flying that my mom had secretly hidden my small photo in my wallet that i carried everywhere. I felt i was safe all these yrs cuz of him??? 

I went to US and altho initially i struggled, i had a good experience later. I thanked every fucking day to my guru for a beautiful day i was getting to feel. My masters was of 1 yr and i felt confident that i can get a job and now thet i have my guru with me, everything will be good. I didnt get TAship for first half but got for the later half. I was grateful to him. Now after graduation i had no luck of getting any interviews. Only handful 4 to be exact.  I saw ppl with no experience getting jobs but i wasnt getting lucky. I intensified my praying. One day i got an out of the body dream of my guru with his words “I am [his name].” I was relieved my guru is there with me and my efforts will pay off soon. I told my mom abt this dream and she went to his aide who said “wat jobs are left in US these days?” I felt anger hearing this exchange from my mom as i was seeing my freinds getting hired and even later. 

But as i was running out of money, i came back home with just handful of clothes. I had so much faith in him that i didnt get anything for me or my family. Nothing. Nada. Just few change of clothes for daily use and a formal shirt for interview. 

Then i visited his aide who is considered as guru only but diff body cuz my prayers were not getting answered. He told me read some holy scriptures and light holy lamps at his place of worship. I visited him 5 times as I was not seeing anything. I had a strong feeling only my guru can save me and i used to have frequent dreams of him too. I used to feel reassured and my mom too. I was very much in distress. I applied, had coffee chats, prayed everything and followed US time even. But nothing. After coming back home, 6 months later my visa expired and i was shattered. My mother vowed to not pray him and visit his place. So did my sister except my dad. 

I was anguished, enraged at everything. I seethed at myself for believing occurrence of events as my guru’s divine interference. I felt my grip on reality losing for the dreams i had and i never in my life had taken and drugs for gods sake nor drinks. I have lived an honest life to the best extent. I felt stupid for watching his videos, believing in his words and even stupid for the dreams i was believing. Normally ppl get high to see this kind of stuff. I was sober and had these experiences. I started to hate him and it was deep. I have never in my life blamed any1 believing humans are born to make mistakes/deceive its human nature. But i cannot forgive him. I felt i got scammed for the money i spent for lighting lamps and time i spent. I see him as the most glib swindler of this era. His entire clout makes me feel bitter. I dont want him to exist. All dreams stopped. Whenever i see his picture it hurted me from inside i used to feel pain, anger and most importantly loss of trust and my belief. I asked my parent to remove all of his photos and not to say his name to me. But i cannot let his thought go. I cannot seem to forgive him. I want him and his entire family to suffer. I want to see his grandkid’s dreams drown while he is alive. I want him to find even from the darkest corners of hell and make him pay for the most valuable thing: faith that i put on to him. I want him to suffer for positioning him something he is not. I have regular arguments with my mom abt him as she still worships him. 

I recently got job 7 months after visa expiry and my mom and sister broke their vow and visited his place. I see him as my only enemy and that my mom is worshipping my enemy. I dont know how to treat this hatred that i feel for no one but him. Its so deep in my core. ",1,1740322342.0,LifeAdvice,2,0.67,False

4) there will also be some built ins in place beside the fireplace that will be white more than likely. Possibly redoing the fireplace mantle / hearth to either a different color but would love to knock it down and replace with brick and a wooden mantle. ",3,1740322322.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

I got the Feb. 02 roast, and opened it up 14 days off roast. The first thing that I noticed when I opened the bag was the intensity of the fragrance. It smelled extremely floral and syrupy, like the mentioned white peach note. All of my brews of these beans were done with TWW light diluted to a little under 50%, at 210f on a v60 with t-90 filters, unless mentioned otherwise. My first brew was ground with an S3 halfway between 5 and 4 grind setting, and a 1 minute bloom to 45g + a single high-agitation pour up to 240g. What stood out to me was the intense, punchy body in this cup, which made me want to keep sipping, and offered an extremely unique experience to me. 

The next day, I opened up my new Pietro Pro brewing grinder, and after a little seasoning, tried the same recipe, but with beans ground at exactly 8 on the Pietro. This time, I got a ton of pleasant acidity in the cup alongside some tea-like flavors, but there was little body. Although it was an enjoyable cup, going forward I adjusted my brewing to the recipe by Harry from Moonwake, keeping bloom the same and continuing with high-agitation pours, but splitting my brew into 2 pours, one up to 160g after the bloom, then waiting for water to reach just above the coffee bed before pouring up to 240g. With this recipe I got an extremely pleasant body and density of flavor, but in a ""separated"" tasting cup, where I felt I could pick apart changes in flavor throughout a sip, alongside many perceived flavors layered on top of each other. Usually when brewing with the Timemore S3 I felt that I could only pick apart 1 or 2 flavors at once, with one often dominating the cup, while with the Pietro I felt that I could get 3 or 4 at once, interacting with each other to shape my perception. A significant amount of this perception, however, is likely due to the high quality of the beans.

As the beans rested further, going on day 21 today, more of the classic Gesha tea attributes came forward, shifting to a less bodied and less punchy cup, but with an extremely nice, silky body and a pleasant acidity that reminds me of lemon zest or key-lime pie coming in on the finish. I would urge anybody who enjoys complex or tea-like cups with good body to look out for future releases of washed El Burro geshas, as they offer an interestingly punchy and full-bodied example of the usual Gesha flavor profile.

So, here’s my poetic tribute to ‘The Eligible Bachelor.’ Hope it makes you smile (or cringe, or both). Enjoy!

“Fluent in sarcasm,” my bio declares.
“A partner in crime,” a big 🍑 to ensnare.
Here are my biceps, check out my glutes.
Spelling and grammar—couldn’t give two hoots.

Here is my niece, not my secret child,
To detract from the pics where I’m hammered and high.
Motorcycles, cigarettes and pills,
All things I love, plus my Netflix & chills.

Here’s me surrounded by buddies galore,
Just like “Where’s Waldo?” I’m the eyesore.
I’m going to France, you gotta come with,
Damn—the plane’s booked—come to the gym.

Ethical non-monogamy is my life,
I’ve just got to get around to telling my wife.
I hope you like kink, and an alpha male—
I’m freaky in bed when Viagra’s not stale.

I’m a skydiver, weightlifter, runner, and hiker
Mountain climber, camel rider, monk and a biker.
You better keep up because I am no joke
I’m one more activity away from a stroke.

I’m tall if you’re decent, don’t wear stilettos,
My ego intact, we avoid armageddon.
And don’t be a pen pal—I want to meet
My bedroom, at midnight, your sexy feet.

If you don’t like plan A, I’ve got plan B—
Walk in 5 degree weather, freezing with me.
I’d buy you a coffee, but I don’t have my wallet 
I donated to Red Cross when somebody stole it.

I’m willing to travel, I’ll move in tomorrow,
My mother approves—she says I’m a horror.
But I’m a really nice guy, we just finish last—
at least in relationships, not in the bed.

Look at my abs as I hold my big fish,
I hope you’re halfway ready for a steamy tryst.
Just one more thing to add to my allure—

So that's got me thinking.. in these 60 days I haven't really experienced some ground breaking benefits. Maybe switching to tea fully wouldn't hurt for that little boost? I mean ultimately there's gotta be a healthy balance and most of us didn't come to the conclusion caffeine is bad based off a tea habit? Drinking huge Starbucks coffees and energy drinks or numerous cups of extra of those is what got most of us here.. so I know its an idea but I'd like your opinions nevertheless.",1,1740321701.0,decaf,2,0.67,False

Ordered on a Thursday and was at my house on Tuesday so was surprised with how quick it came. I plan to eat healthier and include more protein where I can. Also will be walking everyday 30 minutes to an hour with incline. Will see how it goes!

WEEK 1:   Im on day 2 of the meds and have noticed a few side effects but nothing crazy. Both days i have felt a little out of it but focused at the same time (not sure how to explain that lol). I have also been pretty thirsty. My appetite kind of feels the same but i did notice when I was eating one time I felt a really sudden fullness like if i ate another bite id be sick. But i felt fine once i stopped eating.


EDIT WEEK 4:   Its been 4 weeks and 3 day. I started at 155lbs and am currently weighing at 143lbs, so have lost 12 pounds so far. I was really sick the last week (whole family was - unrelated to the medication) so I do believe i lost a bit from that. I definitely noticed I dont have as much of an appetite and really pace myself without thinking about it when eating. I also have been really turned off by alcohol recently but when i have drank my hangovers have been a lot more severe than usual. I still feel nauseous if i dont make sure to drink a lot of water and eat something. On that note, I find myself drinking a ton of water anyways and in response peeing a lot.

The biggest side effect that has bothered me the most has been an increase in anxiety. I used to be on anti anxiety meds but felt good enough to go off of them once i was out of college, living a more stable lifestyle, and off birth control. However, i feel anxious and noticed my nervous tics have come back almost everyday now (i typically bite the inside of my cheeks when nervous/anxious). Also if i have even the slightest amount of caffeine it is 20x worse. I used to be able to drink coffee all day but now just half a cup makes me so shaky and almost crazy.

-Please consider cutting out or drastically limiting sugar intake. It is hard, but my anxiety is much more manageable. The only exception I give myself is celebrations, specifically those with others. Enjoy birthday cake, pumpkin pie at holiday gatherings, hard candies on Christmas morning, and the like.
-Please do the same with caffeine. I did a “step down” plan. For one week I drank half of what I did the week prior until it was gone. If you drink coffee or tea, start mixing with half decaf. The goal is to gradually step down to no caffeine.
-Please consider working up to one hour of moderately intense exercise a day, preferably outside, preferably first thing in the morning. The most important aspect is the exercise. When I was first starting this journey, I would just get up and watch a show I loved while I marched in place, pumping my arms. Morning and outside components will help your sleep.
-Consider adopting an anti-inflammatory diet. For me that means: no refined grains, no nightshades, no dairy, no gluten, and no beef or pork (especially processed meats like hot dogs). Anti-inflammatory diets are an elimination process, and there are many different methods. 

Since doing these things, my anxiety attacks have gone from severe and long-lasting, to occasional and easier to beat. Thank you to everyone in this subreddit!

1iwbjig,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iwbjig/indecisive_on_profitec_model_3200_cad_max/,Indecisive on Profitec Model [$3200] CAD Max,"History - both my wife and I loves coffee, I can drink multiple shots unaffected thanks to ODing on caffeine pills during high school while staying up late studying. A few years ago I had a Breville BS870XL that while it works, I hated how inconsistent it was pressure-wise, its single boiler delays between brewing/ steaming and its grinder not being consistent (quite possible my machine had issues as I know guys use them in the group with success) but I got to hate it and eventually got rid of it in 2019. Since then I have been using my wife’s nespresso and this week I’ve reached a breaking point settling for crappy stating coffee pods.

Needs - Minimum 4-6 brews between straight double shots and lattes.  But can go up to 10 single shots with milk in a stressful day


Machine Decision - From experience I find myself buying the basic versions of things and very quickly find myself regretting not just investing on the better version where I either waste money by selling for less than what I paid for and then buying what I should have in the first place.

I started looking at the Breville Bambino Plus and moved over to the Profitec Go because I wanted something that would last even though it’s more than double the price but looks damn good. Thing is it’s a single boiler and I really prefer to start steaming while I’m pulling a shot or immediately after stopping the pull. Here is when I fell down the rabbit hole by discovering the profitec move. Really nice machine but it’s still not available in Canada and I keep seeing videos and reviews of its leaking issues which has me weary to wait. That’s when I started looking at other options from profitec with the e61 group head like the Profitec jump which is basically a pro400 that’s a little redesigned and while it only has a single boiler, its heat exchange allows once to steam and brew at the same time and it’s a little cheaper than the the Move. Then I started looking at the Profitec Pro 600 with the quick steam and flow control that’s open box and just a few hundred more than the move/jump. And here is where I’m not sure what to get. Yes I know I went from $600 cad (bambino plus) to $1500 cad (Profitec go) to $2800 cad (Profitec move) to $2600 cad (Profitec jump) to $3200 cad (Profitec pro600 v2). 

I just need some to be my voice of reasoning but $3200 cad is my veining for buying a machine and the reason I’m willing to spend so much is that coffee is a daily for me, I want quality and don’t want to spend on another machine for years. I want something that I can repair easily with support and ease of accessibility and I want something that would look damn good.

Ps yes I’m also looking at grinders to complement the machine and currently have my eyes on a niche zero unless anyone can advise otherwise.

Why Your Motion Logo’s Color Matters More Than Your Morning Coffee 

 Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Color? Really? Isn’t that just picking whatever looks nice?"" Oh, my sweet summer child. Choosing the wrong color in a motion logo is like putting pineapple on pizza—controversial, divisive, and guaranteed to start a fight in the comments section.

 The Psychology of Color (Or How Your Logo Might Be Making People Angry)

Colors aren’t just pretty—they have feelings. Yeah, that’s right. Your brand’s colors are out here influencing emotions like a hypnotist at a bad Vegas show.

Red screams excitement, urgency, and “Buy this before it disappears forever!”

Blue is calm, professional, and basically the “I promise I won’t steal your credit card info” of colors.

Yellow is fun, energetic, and perfect for brands that want to say “We’re here to make you happy, whether you like it or not!”

Green makes you think of nature, health, and “We swear we care about the environment.”


Now, imagine your motion logo is for a luxury watch brand, and you slap neon pink on it. Congrats! You’ve just turned a high-end brand into an early 2000s MySpace profile.

Motion + Color = A Relationship More Complicated Than Dating

It’s not just about picking a nice color—it’s about how that color moves. If your logo zips onto the screen with bright red and flashing lights, congratulations, you’ve just given your audience a heart attack.

On the flip side, if your logo glides in with a soft pastel blue, it whispers, “Hey, don’t worry. We’re smooth, we’re classy, and we definitely won’t send you ten spam emails a day.”

And gradients? Oh boy, gradients are like fashion trends—done right, they look sleek and modern; done wrong, they scream “Welcome to Windows 98.”

 The Worst Motion Logo Color Mistakes (Aka Crimes Against Design)

Let’s talk about some real horror stories.

The Black-on-Black Disaster – Ever seen a logo where the text and background are so close in color, you have to squint like you’re deciphering ancient hieroglyphics? Yeah. Don’t do that.

The Rainbow Explosion – Just because color exists doesn’t mean you need to use all of them at once. Unless you’re running a unicorn-themed daycare, keep it together.

The Unintentional Mood Shift – A finance company with bright orange and comic sans? That’s not an investment firm, that’s a lemonade stand.


Conclusion: Make Your Colors Work for You, Not Against You

At the end of the day, your motion logo should feel right. It should match your brand, move with purpose, and—most importantly—not make people’s eyeballs beg for mercy.

So next time you’re designing a motion logo, remember: color isn’t just a choice—it’s a statement. And if you’re not sure what statement you’re making, well… maybe start with not neon pink.

Hand-forged iron chairs with leather cushions provide a sense of medieval elegance against the stark modernity. --ar 2:3 --stylize 700

4) A spacious master bedroom with a sleek, all-black floating bed that appears to hover weightlessly over a thick, handwoven wool rug in warm, earthy tones. The walls are paneled with temperature-controlled steel, cold to the touch, yet a massive floor-to-ceiling fireplace made of reclaimed barn wood radiates intense warmth.

5) A grand indoor atrium with a retractable glass ceiling, creating the illusion of an open-air space. Towering cedar trees grow through the marble floor, their roots encased in glass, revealing their intricate underground networks.

A koi pond seamlessly transitions into an infinity-edge reflection pool, blurring the line between interior luxury and wild Pacific Northwest nature. --ar 2:3 --stylize 500

6) A hyper-modern workspace with walls of matte-black carbon fiber, interrupted by a single, floor-to-ceiling panel of unpolished cedar, its knots and imperfections left untouched. The desk, a monolithic slab of honed basalt, features a seamless touchscreen interface embedded in its surface, yet atop it sits a vintage brass inkwell and fountain pen, an ode to analog craftsmanship. One side of the room opens to a panoramic glass wall, revealing the misty forest beyond, while the other is lined with heavy, deep-green velvet drapes, their theatrical presence contrasting the office’s precision. A minimalist Eames chair, all smooth leather and chrome, rests beside a massive, overstuffed reading chair wrapped in cracked, weathered leather, its presence a paradox against the room’s sleek austerity. Smart lighting adjusts in perfect synchronization with circadian rhythms, yet a single, antique banker’s lamp casts an uneven golden glow on the desk. --ar 2:3 --stylize 750
 
7) A vast, cathedral-like library composed entirely of wood, where no two surfaces match yet somehow create a seamless whole. The walls are a patchwork of different species--ebony, walnut, cherry, and maple--arranged in a Mondrian-like geometric grid, their contrasting grains clashing yet flowing together. The towering bookshelves, carved from raw cedar beams, reach skyward, while a single, impossibly thin floating staircase of polished mahogany seems to defy gravity as it winds toward the mezzanine. The floor is an intricate parquet of alternating light and dark oak, a perfect symmetry disrupted by a single, sprawling slab of live-edge redwood, preserved as both pathway and centerpiece. The furniture embodies paradox: a brutalist, angular reading desk in scorched pine sits beside a delicate, ornately carved rosewood armchair with impossibly thin legs. A fireplace, built from petrified wood that feels both ancient and futuristic, crackles beneath a vaulted ceiling of interlocking cypress beams that twist in an Escher-like impossibility. Recessed, soft amber lighting highlights the room’s deep, organic textures, yet hidden in the walls are high-tech, motion-activated book lifts, seamlessly retrieving volumes from unreachable heights. A massive, suspended chandelier made entirely of intertwined driftwood and Edison bulbs casts shifting, asymmetrical shadows, evoking both nature’s chaos and human craftsmanship. At the far end, an arched doorway, its frame composed of interwoven branches lacquered to a mirror-like sheen, leads to a private alcove--where the paradox continues. Here, a single chair made of layered plywood bends into an ergonomic impossibility, and a towering bookshelf is filled not with books but with meticulously stacked slices of thin-cut timber, mimicking the pages of a novel. The space is a study in contrast--refined yet wild, precision-crafted yet uncontainable, a temple to both nature and the mind’s relentless search for order within chaos --ar 2:3 --stylize 750",0,1740321410.0,midjourney,0,0.5,False

She asked later on though if my height on my profile was accurate which I said it was. She said she admired the honesty and that she knows it must be hard for me to disclose... I was thinking you don't know anything about what it's like. 

Anyway we met, and she couldn't stop bringing up my height. I was super ashamed during the hour date at the coffee shop we met at. She was making comments like she was almost as tall as me and literally, the worst part was how much she was insisting for us to go to a minute clinic afterwards so I can get measured there.. I couldn't believe it. She said there's no way I was even 5'5"" and that I lied. I'll admit I'm kind of gross and overweight and I think I look wider and maybe shorter, but I am 5'5"" and I've regularly lost weight. The final straw was a racist comment though, I said during our conversation something where my Indian accent came out, which will randomly happen on words. I said ""water bottle"" which the ""w"" sounded more like a ""v"" sound and she was in hysterics. In the moment I didn't know why, until she finally calmed down and said it's weird how I talk even though I've been living in America for so long. 

I am in my 30s now.. and just lost my patience. I said that I needed to go and she quickly agreed. She was practically on here phone the entire date anyway, and it just reminded me how I shouldn't pursue dates with anyone.

Mind you, I told her already what I did for a living during text conversation and again during our date. She stood there next to my car for a 5 minutes and asked to take pictures of the vehicle and I told her no, but she did anyway.

1iwbe7g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwbe7g,[Episodes Ranking + Review]: Top 10 Panda Episodes in We Bare Bears,"Top 10 Grizz Episodes: https://www.reddit.com/r/webarebears/s/x8N4zXdoYd

5 MONTHS AWAY FROM WE BARE BEARS 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY!!!!!!!!!!

On the last Sunday of every month, I will write a post about the Top 10 Episodes of various categories.

This list is entirely SUBJECTIVE so you are free to disagree with this ranking. The second one is our cute but unlucky Panda. He's certainly very controversial since lots of people love him and lots of people hate him as well, and I belong in the former. 

What counts as a Panda episode to me? It's simply one that Panda contributed the most or when he is paired with other side characters like Charlie or Lucy and he plays a major part in such duos.

- HONORABLE MENTIONS:

Panda’s Date: Great introductory episode that fully shows both Panda and Lucy’s traits. But like some early S1 episodes, the climax feels unexciting and a bit boring. It's kinda funny to see what ridiculous way Panda would think of just to save his date though.

The Limo: Fantastic lesson about letting go of the other person if they’re happy with someone else. However, the episode focused too much on T-Pain in my opinion when I would love to see how Panda would interact with Kale (Lucy’s boyfriend) more.

Summer Love: I really don't like the “evil scientist” plot , because it feels really out of place in both Grizz Helps and this episode when the whole plot before the evil scientist is building up to an entirely different concept. I think this episode could have been one of the best “Panda love stories” if it focused more on Panda and the mysterious girl rather than the evil scientist.

- TOP 10:

- 10. LUCY’S BROTHER

I wish that Clifford wasn't a one-off character and that he would reappear in a different episode (but he didn’t).

One common plot in Panda episodes is him changing his ultimate goal as the episode progresses, demonstrating his character development. In Lucy’s Brother, his initial objective was to impress Lucy with his babysitting skills, but later on, he doesn't care about that anymore and actually wants to make friends with Clifford. 

This is actually linked to one of Panda’s subtle character flaws: his disregard of the people around him. In The Movie, Panda says “Nobody likes us, Grizz”, completely forgetting the likes of his friends such as Charlie, Lucy, Chloe, Tabes, Darrell and a few others. And in this episode, Panda finally meets someone who is just prone to allergies like him, someone who can finally understand his “limitations”, but he chooses to use Clifford as a way of impressing Lucy instead of making friends with him until about halfway through the episode. I always enjoy seeing how Panda gradually learns to appreciate the people around him in various episodes (mostly with Charlie) and Lucy’s Brother is no exception.

The idea of someone who is very unathletic and allergic to everything like Panda, acting as a protective big brother makes this episode a very interesting watch for me. Despite being the middle brother, Panda is often seen and treated as the youngest one. So it's a breath of fresh air to see Panda a bit more mature and whether he is capable of protecting others, which most of the time, he is shown to be fully capable of doing exactly that. His trait of making sacrifices is seen in this episode when he almost died while saving Clifford. 

I also adore the chemistry between Panda and Clifford, it's really nice to see them bond with each other through their limitations. It's also implied that Clifford is autistic and doesn't have too many friends as a result, which is why I wanted Clifford to have more episodes just to see him hanging out with Panda, who also has a difficult time making friends.

The part where Grizz, Ice Bear and Lucy hang out is also quite fun. Ice Bear kissing the eggplant is peak meme material.

- 9. BRACES

The only WBB episode that I have mixed feelings on…

Let's talk about the things I DON'T like first that keeps it forever at A tier and never S tier:

The most obvious problem with this episode is Panda attempting literal genocide. Sure it's a cartoon, everyone is gonna be alright in the end so why bother? The thing is We Bare Bears takes place in the context of the real world,  with occasional but typically very minor magical stuff to make it cartoony. So I have to take their actions and put it into our world. Let's think about it like this: what would you think if your friend wanted to kill an entire city? Pretty messed up right? It would have been better if the episode maybe tone down Panda’s intentions, like having him just destroy all phones so no one can mock him online or even have him ruling the world is fine. 

Furthermore, the pacing is completely off in this episode. Panda was angry about his brother leaving him alone, WHEN I COMPLETELY DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN THIS EPISODE. Like they went into the dentist without him, so what? Grizz even said to the person that mocked Panda to “Cut it off man”, what else can you do in that situation? Is Grizz supposed to punch and threaten the guy? Panda’s motivation really does not make any sense in this episode.

Now let's talk about the good things, things that I enjoy so much that it gets into the top 10 despite its problems:

I love when We Bare Bears just go completely crazy out of nowhere. They did it in Coffee Cave, Tote Life and Primal. It's a really effective way of spicing things up from the usual slice of life. But Braces takes things to another level. Panda now has telekinesis power where it allows him to control every single thing. Pandaro is so over dramatic as a character and I absolutely love it with his menacing voice and cool looking cape. This episode has no limits and while this led to some aforementioned problems, it is still an incredibly fun and exciting watch. 

Panda having an emotional moment with his brothers is also another plus I can give to this episode. Panda’s Sneeze has already done this kind of moment where Grizz tried to motivate Panda with Ice Bear following up with a simple yet heartfelt sentence, so I’ll talk about these types of moments more when I get to this episode (which is the next one).

Panda realizing that he was never alone when his brothers are always there fits well with his subtle flaw that I mentioned in the episode Lucy’s Brother. Panda is so focused on the negative side of things that he completely forgets what he currently has. Again, a lot of Panda episodes are about him having to take time to look around and recognize the people he has as friends and family. Such character growth really makes me like him as a character. 

Other details that I like includes: Ice Bear bumping Grizz to not laugh at Panda when Ice Bear is clearly trying hard not to laugh himself; Grizz being completely fine with Panda making a dramatic exit, implying that panda does this a lot; Ice Bear secretly likes toy blasters; Panda suffer the consequences of his actions the most as he lost all of his teeth while Grizz and Ice Bear only got minor scratches.

- 8. PANDA’S SNEEZE

They turned a viral video/meme about a sneezing panda into an entire episode :o

Once again, the one flaw that Panda has that I talked about in the previous 2 episodes is shown here again: his lack of appreciation for what he has. Panda has tried before to make friends online and get as many followers as possible, but when he got famous and gained popularity in this episode, he doesn't want it just because he dislikes being called cute. 

However, We Bare Bears puts great emphasis on real love and affection from real people and heavily criticize shallow acceptance from social media followers, so it is justified that the show wanted Panda to stay away from fame or else he would end up like Nom Nom, whom this episode portrays as really pathetic. 

But the thing I like most about this episode is Panda’s bond with his brothers. For Grizz, he underwent significant character growth from Brother Up by fully supporting Panda and helping him become famous without ever being jealous of him. And that motivational speech Grizz and Ice Bear gave to Panda is my favourite moment of this episode: Grizz encouraging Panda to become himself while Ice Bear handed Panda a rose and said that he’s precious, which is extra meaningful considering how rarely Ice Bear expresses love verbally. Also, I love the side plot where Ice Bear is building a robot, it really aligns with his obsession with technology stuff like in Icy Nights. 

The message of being yourself in Panda’s Sneeze is very fitting for the overall theme of the show. We Bare Bears have a lot of out-of-the-ordinary characters like the bears, Charlie or Chloe, and one of the main themes of the show is about fitting in. Most people, in an attempt to fit in with others, tend to act as “normal” as possible, leading to their loss of uniqueness. I think this episode serves to remind us to not forget about what makes each of us special and embrace our own uniqueness. 

- 7. CELLIE

I need the Phone Finds You feature on my device…

Speaking of which, this episode seems to be comparing between androids and iPhones, with Panda’s phone as the former while Grizz and Ice’s phones are the latter. It uses a common stereotype where iPhones get all the fancy features while androids are filled with limitations. 

I had a lot of fun watching the climax of this episode, especially the part where Panda have to sit between his brothers while hiding their phones under his arms, creating a decent amount of tension that keeps me entertained everytime. 

What this episode takes advantage of is Panda’s most eminent character flaw: his lack of communication. He always tries to find a workaround to a problem instead of saying out what he wants, and as you can see, these workarounds often lead to bigger problems than the initial one. Speaking of character flaws, I have to say this again like the previous 3 episodes, Panda have a tendency to overlook what he currently has when he is too focused on one objective. And in this episode, he traded his precious phone for an inferior one just to impress his brothers. 

I think Panda also highly values justice or fairness, though sometimes it can come off as selfish and petty. Seeing how his brothers mistreated his phone, Panda maybe thought that they don't deserve a phone and therefore, dislike seeing them getting a much better phone than his and try to get rid of their phones. His sense of justice and need for fairness is also seen in other episodes: in The Mall, he is ready to go up against someone who cut his line; in Escandalosos, he calls out Gordito for being unnecessarily brutal to his brothers; in Braces, well it’s pretty obvious that he wanted to get revenge on those who hurt him. 

It's also always nice to see Panda realizing his mistakes in many episodes and trying to find a way to fix it. However, there is nothing he can do to make up for the problems he created in this episode, leading to him being really critical about himself. Now this is where Grizz and Ice Bear comes in and they always seem to find the best solution to cheer Panda up. With how prone Panda is to causing mishaps, it's great that he has his brothers to console him every single time, just imagine how miserable Panda’s life would be without anyone by his side to motivate and encourage him, highlighting Grizz and Ice Bear’s role in his life. 

- 6. PANDA’S ART 

There are a total of 6 episodes with the word “Panda” in it if you’re wondering.

Panda and Charlie is one of my favorite duos in the show simply because of how hilarious they are together, but also how progressive their relationship is. The scene where Charlie dreams about Panda while holding his painting really says a lot about their relationship lmao. Charlie literally says: “Ah, it's okay, Panda. I'd love to help you with your laundry.” while he is sleeping. I find this absolutely wild and hilarious and you can figure out what he means by this :).

But that's enough about Charlie, what about Panda in this episode? Well this episode also acknowledges Panda’s communication problems like the previous episodes. If Panda would have just told Charlie that he needed the painting back and just gave him the other paintings that he drew of him, I’m sure Charlie would be completely fine. But of course, that would undermine the lesson of this episode.

Panda making sacrifices seems to be a trend in these Panda episodes. He is given the chance to become a world-renowned artist but he declines it just to keep a promise to his friend. What a waste, right? No! In fact, I would say that Panda would become Nom Nom if he reaches fame through blatant lies like that. What this show constantly reminds us is how much more valuable the appreciation from our friends and family is than shallow acceptance from becoming famous, and Panda exemplifies this extremely well by thanking Charlie for liking his painting at the end of this episode. Following that is a warm hug from Charlie while Panda is “too tired” to reject that hug (he secretly likes it), just an incredibly cute and wholesome conclusion to this episode. 

I also have to say that the part where Panda is having a conversation with all the Charlies he painted is also really funny. All the references to famous paintings but with Charlie in them is genius. The voice actor for Charlie even changes his voice to fit with the person in the painting (a more feminine voice for the Girl With A Pearl and The Birth Of Venus while a manlier voice for Van Gogh).

- 5. GOOGS

‘Top 10 Most Emotional Sacrifices’ type of episode…

The main takeaway from this episode is obviously Panda saving his brothers by sacrificing himself. Definitely one of the most noble acts in the entire show, proving that Panda can play an important part in protecting his brothers but his allergies and unathleticism doesn't give him many chances to do that. Seeing Ice Bear with an absolutely horrified expression on his face really makes the Panda sacrificing scene more impactful when you know that Ice Bear almost never shows any fear at all in the show. 

Although this episode would have ranked higher if it takes itself more seriously, like Yuri And The Bear or Burrito. Sure it's We Bare Bears, a very comforting show with lighthearted humor and relatively little heavy themes, but still this episode could have aimed for so much more if they were going for such a valuable act like sacrificing oneself. Here's a good example of this: Grizz literally says: “Panda, my beautiful child!” at the sight of losing Panda. Who would say that when they’re losing their brother?? Jean Jacket and Losing Ice literally did better in terms of showing sadness when losing a brother. 

Like Panda’s Friend, this episode also highlights how different Panda is to Grizz and Ice Bear. Specifically in this episode, Grizz and Ice Bear break more rules than Panda, they are more…chaotic. And this episode ends like exactly how Panda’s Friend ended, with Panda appreciating how his brothers are and embracing their own differences. This is incredibly fitting to the theme of family in this show: even though they are 3 different species of bears, this is what makes their bond all the more special as their differences are what allow them to compensate for each other. 

However, the episode kinda makes Grizz and Ice Bear look like dingles. It's really not that hard to not touch anything, especially when it’s on Panda’s special day. It felt somewhat forced in this episode so that's another thing stopping it from ranking any higher than 5th place. 

Love Shmorby btw! 

- 4. CHICKEN AND WAFFLES

I wish there was a Cat Cafe in my area.

Here it is, the episode that started the Panda & Charlie arc. The fact that you can see the clear progression of their bond even in just this episode is very good writing: at the beginning, Charlie hesitated holding Panda’s hand, showing their awkwardness; but later on, Charlie piggyback Panda on their way to the restaurant; when they finally made it, they hug each other while cheering and Charlie even fixed Panda’s glasses, a small act that indicate their friendship. This subtle progression is so interesting that it really gets me hooked on their bond and makes me wonder how far their connection would develop. 

Charlie is one of the most interesting side characters in my opinion. You know how the bears accidentally cause trouble to everyone around them, well Charlie is the one accidentally causing trouble TO them, specifically Panda in this episode. However, most of the trouble he caused is due to his lack of understanding of social norms, which is entirely justified since he barely gets any chance of human interactions. Sounds familiar? That's because the bears are also like that, though on a lesser scale. 

However, even though Charlie is afraid of humans, he seems to be talking to them just fine in this episode (for example in the Cat Cafe), meaning that Charlie could very well fit in with other humans if they didn't see and treat Charlie like an exotic creature (which he is unfortunately). The bears have acted as a connector between Charlie and humans a few times, like in episodes with Tabes and ofc this episode. These instances allow Charlie to see the good side of human beings, giving Charlie a sense of empathy towards them. In fact, this moral is what makes Charlie care about humans like when he saves them in the episode Ralph.

Of course, we have to talk about how good of a friend Charlie is when he is willing to go into an environment he is neither familiar nor comfortable in just to get his friend to a restaurant. He also did the same in Charlie Ball and Panda’s Art where he sacrificed his identity to help a friend out. 

But since this is a top 10 Panda episodes, let's talk about him now. Again, Panda episodes plot is typically a showcase of his flaws and his attempt to fix that flaw. In this episode, Panda’s flaw is his inability to understand what Charlie had to go through and he tried to make up for it by abandoning his restaurant reservation to have dinner with Charlie. They could have ordered takeouts from the restaurant, just saying :v

Panda, I would say, it's incredibly straightforward in terms of his view of others. He sees people as who they are on the outside and he judges them based on that even before getting to know them. This is why he is always rushing to get a girlfriend even though he doesn't know anything about them. For Charlie, Panda always views him as an annoying guy who always invades personal space while ignoring Charlie’s own problems of making friends and being lonely. In this episode, he condemns Charlie for leading them into the sewer, not realizing that he himself caused Charlie to drop the phone into that place. Panda immediately criticized Charlie for how many mistakes he made instead of taking into account Charlie’s effort of getting them that far. After Charlie saved Panda, Panda began to realize how wonderful Charlie is as a friend and, like many other episodes, he learned to grow and change as a person (or a bear in this case). 

Overall this episode is just a vibe to watch. The Cat Cafe and acupuncture sequence alongside Grizz and Ice Bear’s attempt to stall the reservation was great. But I especially like the part where Panda and Charlie are walking in a park while the sun is setting. What a wholesome moment for these two!!

- 3. BUBBLE

Gold Charlie is peak humor!!!

I get to talk about Panda and Charlie for the 3rd time, hurray!!! 

The Panlie relationship is literally one of the only relationship arcs that got a conclusive ending. Grizz and The Poppies didn't get one, Grizz and Nom Nom didn't get one, Ice Bear and Yana didn't get one, etc. I wish We Bare Bears didn't end so soon…

Let's talk about the first half of the episode first. Panda being afraid of germs because he saw a movie about it is pretty fitting considering how dramatic he was in Bear Flu when he googled his symptoms, a bit of continuity I see. I also notice that Grizz was very critical of the movie about germs like he was a movie critic or something, which aligns with his love of movies evident with the Crowbar Jones series. 

Panda getting his own personal bubble is a pretty obvious metaphor for his personality: he dislikes social interaction and rarely ever steps outside of his comfort zone. 

Now let's talk about the second half of this episode. First off, Panda has a tendency to say unnecessarily mean things to others out of nowhere when he calls Charlie a “disgusting germ-infested, moldy hot dog.” He did the same in The Library when he called the librarian “you old turtle.” I think one way of explaining this sudden outburst of anger has to do with his lack of patience. Despite being the logical one of the trio, Panda barely thinks through anything and just acts on impulse whenever he is stressed out on something. 

Moving on to the best part of this episode. Charlie sacrificing himself to save Panda with zero hesitation is so wholesome. You know who else makes sacrifices in order to help others? That would be Panda! I have said before how similar Charlie and the bears are but he is definitely the most similar to Panda. I have made an entire post on how alike the bears and their best friends are, including Panda and Charlie. You can check it out here: https://www.reddit.com/r/webarebears/s/ZfldhWD9Mv. The fact that Panda and Charlie seem so different but yet so similar makes their relationship all the more interesting. 

I’m about to make an improbable connection between this episode and Panda 2. I believe that Charlie sacrificing himself reminds Panda of Panda 2. I doubt that adult Panda even remembers anything in that panda sanctuary but still it's an interesting theory to look into. What allows Panda to make so many sacrifices is because he saw Panda 2 doing the same to help him escape from the sanctuary. And when he saw Charlie doing the same sacrificial act, it means that he sees Charlie as a real friend who would do anything for him, combining with Charlie’s previous effort to help out Panda of course. Panda getting out of the bubble is again a very obvious metaphor for getting out of his comfort zone and overcoming his fear to rescue his friend. 

Both Panda and Charlie’s life is relatively lonely, so them being best friends who would always willing to help each other out is incredibly heartwarming to think about.

Regarding other aspects of this episode, I love how expressive Panda faces are as well as a clever reference to Flapjack close ups when zooming in on Charlie’s face. And of course who can forget about Gold and Handsome Charlie, feels extremely out of place for this episode but that's why I found it absolutely hilarious. 

- 2. DANCE LESSONS

That picture of Panda and Lucy at the beginning is so cute!!! Also Grizz teasing Panda for making a love song about his crush is such big brother energy!

First off, I need to talk about the music in this episode. Both soundtracks are fricking fire!!! Forever On The Dancefloor is such a great interpretation of Dancing in September by Earth, Wind & Fire that it's in my playlist. And the music played at the climax when Panda and Lucy are dancing in the festival is so amazing. I’m mad that it wasn't released as an official WBB ost and the only place I can hear it is by rewatching the episode, which I don't mind since it's one of the most fun I've had while watching a WBB episode. 

I like how despite Lucy’s entire purpose in the show is to be a love interest for Panda, we can still see Lucy as her own character rather than a plot device. This episode happened not because Panda wanted to attract Lucy but rather it's because Lucy’s truck is damaged. Another example is Lucy’s Brother, when it also happened because she is too busy to look after Clifford, and we even see she hangs out with Grizz and Ice Bear in that episode rather than anything to do with Panda. 

We also get to see more of Lucy’s personality in this episode. Unlike other side characters, she really doesnt have anything weird or out of the ordinary. However, this episode gives her more of a character, making her way more memorable. She goes absolutely wild with her dance moves and you gotta give credit to the animators for creating such expressive movements. That one frame with all three bears gasping at the sight of Lucy’s destructive moves is golden!

Panda’s communicating problem is once again acknowledged in this episode, and his workarounds once again only cause more trouble. Panda decided to fix his mistake and together with Lucy, delivered one of the most exciting sequences in the entirety of We Bare Bears. Their dance sequence is just so fun to watch and never fails to keep me on the edge of my seat. It’s the result of hours of practice, but more importantly, a demonstration of their coordination and their chemistry. Lucy’s energetic nature combined with Panda’s more ordered style were able to craft such a chaotic yet organized performance. I love every part of this climax of Dance Lessons. 

Now I’m about to over-analyze one small interaction. There was a section where the farmer who organized the festival told Panda and Lucy that “they’re embarrassing themselves” and Panda was incredibly annoyed and yelled out ""Leave us alone!” You may think that it's just typical Panda being unnecessarily angry for no reason again, but to me, it resembles his growth as a character. Panda used to have the same thought as this farmer guy, that he and Lucy are gonna embarrass themselves if they participate in the festival. But then he realized how negative it is to think that way about Lucy. This sentence from the farmer basically resembles the mindset of Panda’s past self, and showing his anger towards it means that he finds such a mindset unacceptable and is willing to change as well as forget about that version of him. 

Finally, that “Get in” line from Ice Bear while he is committing theft with Grizz is one of the best jokes in the show for me. 

I have to emphasize that the dance sequences alone makes this episode so much more enjoyable for me, enough to put it as the second best Panda episode. 

- 1. PANDA 2

Pretty heart power!

We Bare Bears is so excellent at writing backstories for characters, like literally everything Panda did in this episode perfectly aligns with adult Panda. I made an entire post about this episode here: https://www.reddit.com/r/webarebears/s/RPF5Y6vYtC. It’s my first ever episode analysis so it can be a bit poorly organized or it doesn't fully encapsulate my thoughts in the most fitting vocabulary, but it's still readable imo. 

And that is it for my ranking of the top 10 Panda episodes. After looking through all of them, there are several typical trends I notice in Panda episodes:

- Panda finds workaround to his problem and ends up making it worse, highlighting his communication problems
- Panda undergoing significant character development
- Charlie
- Panda overlooking what he currently has and often trade it for a dumb reason
- Ends with Panda making amends to others

1iwbe70,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetprojectors/comments/1iwbe70/led_projector_with_keystone_correction_for_rpg/,LED projector with keystone correction for RPG gaming,"
Hello!
I'm based in Denmark. I'm looking for a LED projector that does not need to be portable, but it would need to be easy to store away. I don't want to own a tv for the same reason.

I live in a small studio that doesn't allow drilling, and I'm planning to move sometime this year, but I haven't found a place yet. For this reason, I'm not sure about sure about the dimension of the room: my safest bet is that the projector would be at around 3-5m away. For now the projector would be likely right next on a 1.5m tall cabinet, but I would like to try different angles and positions, i.e. coffee table in the middle of the room.

Given this conditions a projector that has good keystone and related corrections available is pretty important to me. It doesn't need to be fast, but I'm tired of manually adjusting my projector every time I use it. Weight is irrelevant to me, but smaller is better (but not a priority). 

I would use it mostly for RPG gaming and some movies, connected to my PC via HDMI or a tv stick (that I own) if not part of the OS. I have a powerful PC so I would like to play videogames at the best conditions.

Sound quality is not that important if I can get better picture quality, but I would prefer a quiet projector.

Living in the Nordics, light conditions are extremely variable, with much light also at night during summer. I would prioritize visibility in dim light conditions rather than picture quality. I can consider buying a removable screen later on, after moving.

Budget is 300-600 euros. I can consider to go higher if REALLY worth it, or if nothing is available for this budget.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve been diagnosed with GAD 6months ago, and got prescribed escitaloprám (10mg), however decided not to take it and only chose CBT(Cognitive behavioral therapy). 

However, something happened 2 weeks ago, I took an energy drink(had coffee before too lol😭) and instantly started having a panic attack. I haven’t been the same since. Have been having panic attacks for another 2 times since that incident. I’ve decided that maybe escitaloprám would help and started to take it. After a week on 5mg, it was time to continue with 10mg. As I did, some hours later I felt another panic attack this time accompanied by strong sensation of burning and face felt numb (in realty, nothing was wrong with my face). 

I was thinking maybe it’s nit the right antidepressant for me? I went back to 5mg since I had 10mg only once. 

I am confused and scared, also of serotonin syndrome and eventually death. 😢

The other week I was on my way home from seeing some friends. I was catching a tram (public transport), minding my own business blah blah. I get off at my stop to get on the next tram and as i was doing so I have a fleeting glimpse of a girl that was also getting off and thought she was pretty, and then i forgot about it.

Walked over to my next stop, at this time i was on the phone to a friend, but i hung up cos he was preoccupied. Anyway, while on the phone i saw the same girl waiting at the same tram stop as me. Then I saw that there were some ticket officers standing around. Another bloke was there and i asked him if he had a spare card i could use as i had forgot my wallet. Then in a quick moment of confidence, i turned to her and asked if she had one and apologised. It was here where i really was stunned by her. She said yeah and had a look through her bag, and the tram was quickly pulling up and i said sorry for rushing her, and she replied shouldve asked me earlier! 

She gave me the card and we ran onto the tram and tapped on. I said thank you and what not, she said something about its better to tap then risk a fine. And we had a bit of friendly small talk. She was wearing this scarf around her head, and i thought it was pretty cool, i thought i should compliment her. I didn’t. 

She told me to hold onto the card and i expressed how i was thankful for what she had done for me. 

Her stop came and here’s where I look back and cringe. As she was getting off the tram she turned around with the biggest prettiest smile i have ever seen and the most beautiful brown eyes and joyfully said safe travels! I smiled and thanked her again as she left. 

The tram pulled away and she was standing at the lights waiting to cross the road, and i looked at her, and she waved, and i waved back.

I immediately thought what the fuck did i just do. Why did i not ask her to get a coffee or something? And i considered getting off at the next stop and running back but i didn’t because i questioned myself and didn’t want to come off creepy.

I have lived with this regret in my mind for around 2 weeks now. I went the same way home the day after it happened (i happened to be working and finished at around the same time to see if she was there). 

To no avail.

But. This is the kicker. The public transport card had her name on it…. However, it’s only her first name.

Maybe its just because I’ve been single for a while, that when a girl gives some of her attention to me, it goes a long way for me. But this was really different. She was gorgeous and seemed genuinely lovely. I’m also generally a reserved person, and i don’t go out of my way to speak to randoms, so i am surprised i did it in the first place.

So now i have to live with knowing only this girls first name, and her warm smile. The city i live in is quite large, around 5 million. So it’s sad to think I’ll never see her again.",1,1740320626.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I did one day without after consecutive 2-3 weeks with no breaks two days ago. That day was fine.

I took no Kratom yesterday but had this massive headache second half of the day. Today woke up feeling fine and no necessity to take Kratom. What I did notice which is interesting is that drinking tea today gave me a noticeable lift, whereas for the last few months tea and coffee did nothing.  I have a huge stack of Kratom so I'll probably use it again starting in a few days, because it does make it easier to do jobs I don't want to do - housework etc...

I am not immune to toxoplasmosis, so no cured meats. Now news to me: no tahini either. I have an iron deficiency, so I have to drink vegetable milk (calcium hinders iron absorption) and I also have to be carful that it's not supplemented with calcium (cause most of them are, wtf?!) and follow a specific diet, avoid certain combinations of food, which, of course, are my favourites. Sweets are always a no-no, we know, except sad ""substitutes"" (eat dates and dried apricots, they are just as good... yeah, sure...) and salt is to be avoided, too. Salad is an elaborate process that I have to clean and ""disinfect"" at home. If I am at a restaurant or someone's house, I have to skip the raw veggies, too... cause they might not be safe!

I have come to a point where - even if I am eating something that I usually enjoy - I hate it, and it doesn't have any flavour at all anymore. It's just food - just something to chew and swallow very mechanically.

I was in a deep sleep until my mobile, suddenly ringing, woke me up. Confused, I stretched in the dark and felt along my bed side table for my phone, hoping that this was spam or an emergency. I looked at my notifications and saw that I had been sent a picture from an unknown number. A young man strapped to a chair, face covered in bruises and blood, eyes wide with fear. I had no idea who this was.
 
The second picture arrived straight after the first. Same man, different picture. His mouth forced open by some kind of metal device, stretching his mouth into a grotesque smile. Teeth broken in his mouth like a shattered mug. Bleeding gums. I still had no idea who this person was. The third picture was the worst. His hands. Missing their fingernails, raw, exposed flesh underneath. I could see the tendons stretched against the bone.
 
I sat up in my bed, still groggy from my sleep, my heart racing. At first, I thought it was a joke, a prank. A wrong number. My brother and I went through a phase of sending each other stuff like this to gross each other out, but I haven’t heard from him in years. It was either morbid curiosity or compulsion that told me to swipe through the pictures again. As I did, a queasy feeling settled over my stomach. There was something very intimate about these pictures. They were too posed, the lighting a bit too deliberate. “This was not an accident…” I thought.
Then the messages started.

“Do you know him?”
 
My breath was getting shallower, as I sat in my dark room. My fingers hovered above the keyboard. I wanted to type, but something restrained me. Instead, I waited. One minute. Two minutes. My phone chimed again.

“You will.”
 
I threw my phone to my side and turned on the light. My room felt different now – smaller, colder. The shadows hung everywhere the light couldn’t reach. I double checked the locks on my apartment door, twice, three times. When I looked at my phone again, there was another photograph.
 
This was different from the rest.
 
I could see a room. Paint clinging for dear life onto the walls. A door with stained wood and rusty hinges, illuminated by a single bulb in the centre of the ceiling, casting long, spidery shadows. The kind of place that smelled of mildew and old blood. I didn’t know it yet, but this place seemed familiar. Like a word on the tip of my tongue. I could hear the faint of pipes that haven’t been maintained for years.

“drip…drip…drip…”
Another message.

“Come find him.”
 
I should have blocked the number. Deleted everything, reported it to someone – anyone. What I did do was stand there, staring at that last photo, my mind unravelling at the seams. I knew this was a bad idea, but some hidden thread had already snagged itself in me, pulling me along. I couldn’t look away.

“I have to know…” I thought.
 
The next day, the pictures wouldn’t leave me alone. I saw them on every shiny surface – my phone, my computer, even the black gleam of my morning coffee. The man’s swollen, battered face haunted me. His eyes pleaded with ME. For what, I didn’t know.
 
The next photo came again at 3am

OG 2.0 QC : https://www.reddit.com/r/RepDeveloperboring/s/Z03OKACeOg

Recent Chicago QC : https://www.reddit.com/r/RepDeveloperboring/s/Q15MyGktKa


Just wanted to highlight the differences & improvements developer boring has made to the Chicagos since the original 2.0 Chicago release. Overtime of course as more colorways have came out more improvements have been made however if you’ve weren’t aware on the Chicagos, despite the fact this pair is an older release he has still continued  to correct issues quietly as restocks have occurred overtime & I think that’s cool

Notable differences 

- the wings logo is matte instead of glossy , this is true to the ogs

- All the white panels including the midsole & tounge on the shoe are now a natural white instead of a pure white. Before the midsole was a pure/grayish white & the leather was just a regular white. The red leather is more varsity red with faded  edges as opposed to the fire red with orange edges on the older pair. This isn’t something most will notice but imo it makes a massive difference in aesthetics. One thing to note my older pair of 2.0s were coffee dyed / brushed in certain areas. To see what they look like new here’s the OG listing https://imgur.com/a/b5itOwO

- swoosh shape is cleaner. 

- The toebox shape is more sleek & slimmer. My old pair was crooked, thick , & very much resembled the retro 85s from Nike where the mudguard was humongous. This new pair no longer has that odd reinforcement on the toe that the started with the breds back When those first released & the Chicago update that came shortly after that

- On the newer releases he changed the og made in Korea tags to his own tounge tags, both my pairs have the og one 

Other than that not much else to note. Currently this pair is sold out in my size 11 & as per borings WhatsApp they said the restock for Chicagos was in March so if you are looking to purchase I’d ask him when March comes around. Currently I was not looking to purchase more rep 85s as I’m on the hunt for real 85s in good condition but I came across a good deal & curiosity got the best of me & im really glad it did because this is definitely the best 85 rep I’ve had & I originally had VRL at the top but this beats that pair just by a very small margin. 

Thx for viewing & stay tuned as I do have an upcoming review on my Nike 85 breds vs my customized boring pair so be on the lookout for that

So, here’s a little more about me—beyond just hobbies and interests.

# Family & Me

I was raised by my elder sister, and that has shaped so much of who I am today. Growing up, I saw firsthand the strength, sacrifices, and emotional labor women carry—often without acknowledgment. It made me appreciate not just resilience but also the importance of emotional depth and understanding in relationships.

My approach to family is built on mutual respect rather than blind obligation. I don’t believe in forced traditions or guilt-driven relationships, but I do believe in showing up for the people who truly matter. Whether it’s family by blood or by choice, I invest in meaningful connections.

# Politics – More Than Just Opinions

I believe being politically aware is a responsibility, not just a personality trait. I lean towards progressive values—equity, inclusivity, and policies that actively work toward improving lives rather than just maintaining outdated power structures.

I don’t seek debates for the sake of debating, but if you enjoy deep, meaningful discussions over coffee, we’d probably get along well. For me, politics isn’t just about ideology—it’s about empathy, fairness, and making sure the world we live in is just a little bit better.

# Feminism – More Than Just a Buzzword

Being raised by my sister gave me a unique insight into a woman’s perspective—not just in theory, but in daily realities. I’ve seen the silent struggles, the unspoken expectations, and the emotional labor that often go unnoticed. I strongly believe feminism isn’t about ‘giving’ women rights—it’s about acknowledging and respecting the ones they should have always had.

I don’t believe in performative allyship; I’d rather actively contribute to a world where gender equity isn’t something that needs to be fought for. Whether it’s calling out biases, sharing responsibilities, or simply being an emotionally intelligent partner—I get it (or at least, I make a conscious effort to).

# What I Bring to the Table

* **Emotional Intelligence & Growth Mindset:** I value open communication, self-improvement, and continuously working on myself.
* **Financial & Emotional Stability:** I’ve built a life that’s secure, independent, and free from unnecessary drama.
* **A Passion for Life:** Whether it’s traveling, cooking, fitness, or deep conversations, I bring enthusiasm and curiosity into everything I do.
* **A Solid Support System:** I believe in trust, reliability, and being someone who shows up for the people in my life.
* **A Sense of Humor:** Life is too short to be taken too seriously. Playful banter, inside jokes, and keeping things light when needed? Count me in.

# What I’m Looking For

* **Emotional Maturity & Self-Awareness:** You don’t need to have it all figured out, but a basic understanding of emotional intelligence and personal growth is important to me.
* **Independent & Self-Sufficient:** I value ambition and a sense of purpose. You don’t need to be climbing corporate ladders, but having your own passions and goals is attractive.
* **A Childfree Mindset:** This is a non-negotiable for me, and I want to connect with someone who genuinely resonates with it.
* **Respect for Boundaries:** Whether it’s personal space, individual interests, or open conversations, mutual respect is key.
* **A Willingness to Laugh & Enjoy Life:** Shared laughter, curiosity, and a sense of adventure make everything better.

If any of this resonates with you, let’s have a conversation. No pressure, no expectations—just seeing where things go.

I'm also going to attach some photos of myself here, because I felt like that would make a difference too.

Hi! I’m a 놀랍게도 한국사랍 입니다... Korean in my early 30s. I grew up in Korea and graduated from Korean schools and university! 

I see a lot of foreigners saying they have so much fun in Korea, and I want to ask—HOW???

Obviously I don’t have any difficulties reading Hanguel because it’s my mother language, I easily get information or getting around, travel but I still feel like there’s nothing to do??? 

I especially agree that there are only coffee shops and malls. I think our entertainment sources are quite limited but people say there are tons of things to do (??????) 

I don’t know what else to do besides going to new neighborhoods and doing 소모적인(exhausting /draining/consuming) things like eating, drinking, and spending money??

And as you know, in Korea, we don’t have a small talk culture. We are kind enough not to stealing other people’s belongings at a café, but we never talk to strangers sitting next to us. The only people who randomly talk to me on the street are cults.

We usually don’t have a chance to meet new people unless we’re brave enough to attend somewhere first. 
But what if i feel like there’s nowhere to go??.. 

 Currently Staying at home and trying new things alone is my best option. I don’t even know what else is out there haha 
((Recently, tried all the hobbies I can do by myself such as subscribing newspapers, studying economics, reading books, build my websites, learning new things, running hiking….. watch 90s drama etc. it’s fun and productive but I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t live alone ) 


🧐 How do you meet travelers or new friends, get to know them? 
Here on Reddit? Dating apps? Or just start conversations with people on the street? Is there any specific community? Apps? 


🧐What are some good activities to do in Korea with people?

I haven’t been as active in this sub the second year as much as I was the first year but I’ve still lurked frequently and read stories as you all give me so much motivation. 

I find myself still having the occasional craving but they’ve died down a lot. I still find myself questioning why I’m doing this, but it’s easier to remind myself why I quit. 

Right now I’m drinking coffee while my kids watch Curious George, I’m tired but I’m not hungover. I can be present. Life isn’t always easy but I’m not doing anything to make it harder, like getting drunk. I still have the occasional NA beer, but I don’t think I need those as much as I used to. 

To everyone just getting started, stay motivated. It’s not easy by any means, but it’s really worth it. I’ve been sober now for longer than I drank during my daughter’s life, and haven’t touched a drop of alcohol during my son’s life. 

Today I’m going to celebrate by going to church, drinking Fresca, eating a bunch of fried chicken and ice cream. So pray for my stomach!

Probably my favourite coffee ever. It's so rare to find something that has such a clear, defined and dominant flavour profile. 

I'll by having this as an espresso/long black... But it's best with a pour-9ver.

My coffee shop hardly ever has it available. Currently being sold in 125g bags.

This record, along with a stack of other jazz/funk stuff came to me in a $35 fb marketplace listing. I was as shocked then as I am now. Some of the most amazing records I’ve ever heard came from a $35 box off of Facebook. 

And this 1963 US Mono pressing sounds just fantastic on my Lafayette T6000/Harman Kardon 730/JBL 4311s. True bliss this Sunday morning with nothing but some good jazz and good coffee. Happy spinning yall ✌️",10,1740319925.0,Vinyl_Jazz,1,1.0,False
