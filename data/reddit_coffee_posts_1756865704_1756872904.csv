I‚Äôm hoping to meet strangers (which is why I‚Äôm not posting in my college subreddits) just to chat over coffee or a meal. If you‚Äôre 18‚Äì20, maybe we could meet around Newbury, Back Bay, or Brookline.

I‚Äôm 36, gay, engaged, and living in Arizona. By day I work in healthcare informatics, and because I apparently like a challenge, I just started grad school too (yes, my calendar is basically a dare at this point).

When I‚Äôm not buried in work or studying, you‚Äôll find me paddle boarding, hiking, baking, checking out breweries, or running around a theme park. I love urban exploring, live music, food fests, and movie marathons ‚Äî I‚Äôm just as happy at a Night of the Living Dead double feature as I am with a chill night in.

Life‚Äôs good: great partner, solid job, things feel steady. But building new friendships at this stage? That‚Äôs the tricky part.

Has anybody that‚Äôs tried that flavor before it was discontinued, had any other canned coffees that are reminiscent of it? I think my biggest thing was the texture when I took a sip of it.

1n74yws,https://www.reddit.com/r/trampt/comments/1n74yws/tips_on_how_to_display_your_collection/,Tips on How To Display Your Collection,"A great collection deserves a great display. Here's how to make your collection look as good as it deserves to. We'll cover display materials that work best, lighting that brings out the details, and the most common threats that can damage your collection, plus tips from collectors who've learned these lessons the hard way.

# Glass vs. Acrylic Plastic: The Showdown

[Image by @TheArtOfTheSneaker on Instagram](https://preview.redd.it/27wv6v7tjvmf1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ea6ffa51c9254dcbf277332bd5d363b12452679)

Each material has its strengths for showcasing your collection:

* **Glass Cabinets:** The classic collector choice. They're substantial, have that premium feel, and IKEA's Detolf remains the unofficial collector standard for good reason. Glass gives you a museum-quality look but comes with increased weight and potential glare issues.
* **Acrylic Cases:** The rising star in the display world. Acrylic offers better clarity than glass, weighs significantly less, resists shattering, and creates less glare. Perfect for smaller displays or when you need something custom-sized. The tradeoff? It scratches more easily than glass.

# Display Styles Worth Considering

Different collections need different approaches:

* **Floating Shelves**: Modern look, great for small spaces. (Anchor into studs ‚Äì toys are heavier than you think.)
* **Shadow Boxes**: Perfect for highlighting individual grails.
* **Under-Glass Coffee Tables**: Show off pieces while still having somewhere to put your drink.
* **Acrylic Risers**: Create depth and tiers within larger cabinets.

# Lighting Makes a Difference

[Image by @BoyChromeHearts on Instagram](https://preview.redd.it/3yupwclzjvmf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ef59941e4863c8572dac2f0e9638a95377fec9f)

Lighting isn't just functional, it transforms how your collection is perceived:

* **LED Strips:** The collector's go-to for a reason. They're low-heat, energy-efficient, and create even illumination that makes colors pop. LEDs create clean, even light that enhances detail and can be dimmed for dramatic effect. Best for overall case lighting.¬†
* **Puck Lights:** Perfect for spotlighting individual pieces or for cabinets without easy access to outlets. Creates focused pools of light that draw attention to each toy.
* **Fluorescent Bulbs:** Provides broad, uniform lighting, but can create a retail-store feel.¬† Tends to flatten toys‚Äô appearance and give them a weird blue-green glow.
* **Incandescent Bulbs:** The old standard. Creates a warm light that adds a gallery-like vibe. Looks great with vintage pieces because of the nostalgic feel, but they run hot and use more energy than other bulbs.
* **Color Temperature Matters:** Warm white (2700-3000K) creates a cozy, gallery-like feel. Cool white (5000K+) makes colors more vibrant but can feel clinical. Most collectors prefer the middle ground (3500-4000K) which balanced color accuracy with a pleasant ambiance.
* **Light Positioning Also Matters:** Lighting from above mimics natural light, and creates gentle shadows. Side lighting brings out textures and other details. Back lighting creates dramatic silhouettes. Play around with placement, because it can completely transform how a piece is perceived.¬†

# Things That Will Destroy your Collection

* **Sunlight:** UV exposure will fade colors faster than you think. Direct sunlight is basically toy torture, even filtered through windows. To protect your collection:¬†
   * UV-filtering film on windows blocks about 99% of harmful rays while still letting in light, and are relatively affordable. *Available at: Home Depot, Lowe's, or Amazon* 
   * Museum glass/acrylic in display cases provided built-in UV protection, but can be expensive. *Available at: Frame shops, specialty glass suppliers, or TruVue online* 
   * Polycarbonate sheeting naturally blocks about 99% of UV rays without special treatment. *Available at: TAP Plastics, Home Depot, or specialty plastic suppliers* 
   * UV-resistant display cases provide long-term protection but can also be expensive. *Available at: Specialty display companies, museum supply stores, or custom builders* 
   * Blackout curtains are your best defense if your display faces the window. Prices vary. *Available at: Target, Wayfair, or any home goods store* Regular rotation minimizes extended exposure and is (obviously!) the most affordable solution.
* **Cigarette smoke:** Beyond the smell that never leaves, smoke creates a sticky residue that attracts dust and yellows white vinyl over time. The resale value of smoke-exposed toys plummets, and no amount of cleaning fully removes it. Keep your collection in smoke-free spaces, period.
* **Pets:** Your cat that ""never jumps on anything"" will 100% decide that your limited edition pieces make excellent batting practice. Enclosed cases are your best friend if you've got furry roommates. Dog hair has an uncanny ability to get inside even sealed cases, however, so expect to clean the insides from time to time.
* **Heat sources:** Keep displays away from radiators, heating vents, and direct sunlight. Vinyl gets soft, paint can bubble, and adhesives fail when they get too warm.
* **Humidity extremes:** Too dry and plastics get brittle. Too humid and you have potential mold issues and paper accessories warp. An ideal humidity level is between 40-60% . Affordable humidity meters (hygrometers) are available at Home Depot, Amazon, or any hardware store.
* **Earthquakes:** Earth go wobble, toys go boom. Half of you just laughed, half of you winced from experience. Sometimes gravity wants what it wants.
   * Museum putty exists for a reason! This removable adhesive secures toys to shelves without damaging them. You can find it at Home Depot, Amazon, and most hardware stores.¬†

# Pro-Tips from Collectors

* **Consistent spacing**: Keep 2-4 inches between pieces for a cleaner look.
* **Plan your layout**: Arrange by theme, color, or size before committing.
* **Rotate your collection**: Not everything needs to be displayed at once.
* **Dust with makeup brushes**: Be gentle on delicate parts.
* **Take collection photos**: For insurance purposes and to track what's in storage
* **Clean hands before handling**: Oils from fingers are collection enemy #1, If you really want to go extra, try white cloth gloves.

### Highlights

*   **The European List:** Grujiƒá and Pereyra are in, but there are also cuts that are causing (expected) complaints.
*   **Marko Grujiƒá:** Officially an AEK player with the classic promises of winning titles and our prayers for him to stay healthy.
*   **Transfer Gap:** The search for a forward continues, but whoever arrives will be watching the European games from their couch until 2026.
*   **Basketball in the Snow:** The ""Queen"" has headed to the Alps for their main preseason training with their new maestro, Lekaviƒçius.

### The European List: Choices, Questions, and the Eternal Anxiety

So, AEK has submitted its player list to UEFA for the Conference League. For the uninitiated, this is the team that will try to bring European glory (or at least a decent run) until December. And as usual, the coach's choices are perfect for coffee, discussion, and plenty of sarcasm.

The good news? Newcomer **Marko Grujiƒá** is in, as expected, and **Roberto Pereyra** returns from his injury. The... expected news? Marko Nikoliƒá has shown his hand, leaving out players who seemingly don't fit his philosophy. **Jens J√∏nsson** and **Robert Ljubiƒçiƒá** are paying the price for the aforementioned two to be included, confirming that the Serbian coach isn't messing around.

Of course, the list wouldn't be complete without the permanent absentees, **Moses Odubajo** and **Anthony Martial**, who continues his career as the team's most expensive fan. ü§î Young **Kaloskamis** was unlucky, being cut to make room for Chrysopoulos as an extra option at center-back.

The big question, of course, remains the same: With only one right-back on the entire list (Lazare, fingers crossed üôè) and a defense that numerically looks like a joke, how far can we go? The answers, as always, will be given on the pitch. You can read the [full list on Sport24.gr](https://www.sport24.gr/football/evropaiki-lista-aek-oi-eklektoi-tou-nikolits-gia-ti-league-phase-tou-conference-league/).

### Welcome, Marko. Let's Be Careful.

AEK has officially announced the signing of **Marko Grujiƒá**, the Serbian midfielder that Nikoliƒá desperately wanted. In his [first statements](https://www.aekfc.gr/newsdetails/marko-gkrougits-na-kataktiso-titlous-me-tin-aek-133063.htm), he said the expected things: ""To win titles,"" ""privileged to be here,"" and other nice sentiments we've heard countless times. At least he learned he shares a birthday with the club, a coincidence that makes us... a little happier too.

Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room: his medical record. The word ""injury"" next to an AEK transfer gives us all a slight PTSD flashback (see: Lamela). However, the calmer reporters, like those at [Sport24](https://www.sport24.gr/football/aek-giati-i-periptosi-gkrougits-den-sxetizetai-me-ekeini-tou-lamela-oute-borei-na-exelixthei-se-tetoia/), rush to reassure us. His injury was an Achilles infection, not a rupture. His contract is described as a ""controlled risk,"" which in plain terms means if he doesn't play, he obviously won't cost us a fortune.

So let's hope the player who took the number ""4"" jersey proves to be a golden ticket and not another failed bet. Patience is a virtue, they say. At AEK, it's a prerequisite.

### Scattered News & Other Demons

**The Forward Odyssey:** The management continues to search for a striker, but the deadline for the European list passed yesterday. This means that any ""killer"" who is signed (if one is signed) will only be eligible to play in the league and cup until January. They'll be watching the matches against Fiorentina and Samsunspor on TV, alongside Martial. Excellent planning, as usual. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**The Queen in the Mountains:** To change the mood a bit, the AEK basketball team has arrived in the Italian Alps for the main stage of their preseason. With them is the latest signing, Lithuanian guard **Lukas Lekaviƒçius**. The team will play friendlies against Cremona and Trento, aiming to get some fresh air and build chemistry, far from the toxicity that plagues us all down here.",1,1756872210.0,AEKAthensFC,0,1.0,False

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I‚Äôm walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don‚Äôt pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren‚Äôt far behind
being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre
a wolf?‚Äù Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.",1,1756872146.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Firsthand insights, regulatory updates, and expert strategies for Bahrain company formation in 2025\
\
A Personal Business Journey, from Bahrain Financial Harbour to Seef District\
I still remember my first startup meeting in the glass-wrapped boardroom of Bahrain Financial Harbour, staring out across the glimmering water toward Bahrain Bay. Noon sun cast shadows over the Diplomatic Area, where government offices busied themselves with digital paperwork and entrepreneurs shuffled between Sijilat terminals. My own journey began with a simple dream‚Äîlaunching a cross-border e-commerce platform‚Äîyet quickly became a lesson in local customs, regulatory secrets, and the nuances that set Bahrain apart from its UAE and Saudi neighbors.\
Was it intimidating? Absolutely. But Bahrain‚Äôs business landscape, especially after a fresh regulatory update in January 2025, made the entire process not just navigable, but surprisingly welcoming if you know where to walk. I‚Äôll show you how.\
\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals discussing company formation in Bahrain. and Reuters highlight Bahrain‚Äôs pragmatic approach to economic diversification. As of Q2 2025, e-commerce accounted for over 17% of non-oil GDP, with annual sector growth tracking at 12.8%. The Economic Development Board (EDB) forecasts e-commerce revenues to surpass $2.1 billion by 2026, outpacing regional competitors through regulatory agility and digital infrastructure.\
Importantly, Bahrain is the first GCC nation to fully digitize its company formation portal (Sijilat), cutting average license processing time to just 4 business days. Unlike the UAE, where onshore e-commerce activities often require local partnership, Bahrain boasts near-total foreign ownership rights‚Äînow expanded by the January 2025 MOICT update.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting for Bahrain company formation, showing Middle East corporate district.)\
- Digital-first regulatory approach: End-to-end online processing via Sijilat\
- Business-friendly tax: 0% corporate income tax for most sectors‚Äîincluding e-commerce\
- Full foreign ownership: Up to 100% in most activities (see official update)\
The New 2025 Licensing Requirements: Step-by-Step Process\
Securing your e-commerce license in Bahrain involves several interconnected steps. Here‚Äôs what you need to know, straight from my daily grind inside the Seef District‚Äôs government offices.\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain company formation, showing team meeting. or SPC (Single Person Company) will almost always suffice for small-to-medium ventures.\
* For larger, investor-backed online marketplaces, consider a BSC (Closed Shareholding Company).\
* Consulting this entity comparison guide can save days of head-scratching.\
Ownership structure:\
- 100% foreign ownership now applies to almost all e-commerce activities‚Äîno nominee needed (details).\
- For select activities, GCC nationals retain some marginal benefits, but most expats can go it alone.\
Local Custom: The Majlis Factor\
Don‚Äôt skip the majlis-style meeting with prospective partners or legal advisors. Even for pure online ventures, sharing coffee in a traditional setting speeds up trust and opens doors at MOICT or LMRA (and yes, you‚Äôll get better queue placement if you arrive just after maghrib prayers‚Äîtrust me).\
2. Reserve Your Company Name & Set Up Sijilat Account\
\
Register a unique business name in both English and Arabic via Sijilat portal.\
Pro tip: Names containing ""Bahrain,"" ""International,"" or ""Holding"" require special pre-approval and may delay formation by 1-2 weeks.\
\
3. Secure Commercial Registration (CR) for E-Commerce Activities\
CR is mandatory for all Bahrain businesses. For online trading, select the E-Commerce activity code (now expanded by 2025 MOICT Notification 102/2025, effective March 10, 2025):\
\
‚ÄúAll e-commerce and online retail activities must be specifically listed under commercial registration activity codes 6209.00 & 4791.00.‚Äù\
\
\
Apply directly here\
Attach business plan, lease agreement (even if virtual office), and owner identity documents.\
\
4. Obtain Additional Sectoral Approvals\
\
Sell digital goods/services? Get Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) consent.\
Online payments? Connect with CBB-licensed payment gateways.\
Import/export physical products? Customs Authority registration is required.\
\
Surprisingly, I found the hardest part was not the paperwork but explaining to bank relationship managers how an ‚Äúe-commerce-only‚Äù venture works‚Äîbring visual flowcharts for faster onboarding!\
\
Practical Example: Setting Up an E-Commerce Fashion Store in Seef\
Early last year, I helped a client launch a boutique fashion e-commerce site.\
Here‚Äôs the shortcut we used:\
- Chose a virtual office in Seef District for the CR (more affordable, avoids high-profile Diplomatic Area rents).\
- Applied mid-week (Monday at 10AM) to beat the MOICT midday rush.\
- Prepared all required documents in advance using the KeylinkBH document checklist‚Äîshaved 3 days off processing.\
Common mistake: Forgetting to list ‚Äúe-marketing‚Äù alongside ‚Äúonline retail‚Äù‚ÄîMOICT requires both for digital sales platforms. Avoid resubmission delays by double-checking all secondary activities.\

Compare latest costs here\
\
My tip: For lean e-commerce setups, budget BHD 1,000 ‚Äì 2,200 for year one, inclusive of incorporation and first-year expenses. Don‚Äôt forget a BHD 5 government stamp for every notarized document‚Äîtiny fees, but skipping it means repeat trips to the Notary in Diplomatic Area (where lines snake out the door during Ramadan!).\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation and e-commerce licensing.. Non-filers face steep penalties.\
Maintain accurate bookkeeping‚ÄîBahrain MOICT requires at least 5 years of transaction records, which is why I always recommend using a professional accounting service like KeylinkBH‚Äôs Accounting and Bookkeeping.\
2025 Compliance Change: Beneficial Ownership Register\
Effective April 1, 2025, all companies must submit beneficial ownership information online quarterly‚Äîmissing a single update can result in suspension of CR for one full month.\

2. Speed: Company registration in Bahrain often completes in under 7 days, while UAE and Saudi can stretch to 3-6 weeks for similar activities.\
3. Cost: Bahrain‚Äôs annual maintenance for a simple e-commerce company rarely exceeds BHD 2,000, at least 35% cheaper than UAE Free Zones.\
\
Free Zones & Special Licenses\
Considering logistics or cross-border warehousing? Bahrain Free Zones offer customs/tax efficiencies and streamlined import/export licensing:\
\
Explore Free Zones in Bahrain for e-commerce fulfillment hub benefits.\
Free Zone entities now enjoy full digital integration with Sijilat‚Äîbut must appoint a Bahrain-based authorized signatory.\
\
\
Recommended Resources & Trusted Partners\
KeylinkBH remains my go-to formation service for transparent pricing and document prep (compare providers here).\
For payment gateway solutions, CrediMax and BenefitPay are Bahrain‚Äôs most widely accepted.\
Common mistake: Entrepreneurs often overlook post-CR requirements, such as registering for LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) if they plan to hire staff, or VAT registration at the appropriate threshold.\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, customer service, and business consultation for e-commerce company in Bahrain.\
2. Do I need to be physically present in Bahrain for licensing?\
\
No, the entire process can be handled remotely via Sijilat, although opening a local bank account may require a brief visit for identity verification. Using a local advisor can further streamline this.\
\
3. What documents are required for CR application?\
\
Typically:\
- Owners‚Äô passport copies\
- Proof of address\
- Proposed business plan\
- Lease agreement (virtual office allowed)\

I love your podcast! I have been binging it since I found it a few weeks ago and I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôve almost caught up and will have to wait for episodes soon haha. Anyways, here‚Äôs my story.
¬†I (28F) met my best friend Nate (27M) when I was 18-19. We worked together for a year and a half and ended up becoming good friends. We would walk home together, hang out, and I occasionally went to his house to watch movies. I did fall in love with him early on, but he ended up dating a girl from my friend group (that lasted only a couple months), so I didn‚Äôt make a move for a couple of years, even after they had broken up. When I did make a move he declined me nicely, and I had to weigh up whether the friendship was more important to me then the rejection and I decided it was, he was still my best friend, and we had been through a lot together. In all honesty it took me a while to get over him, lots of tears and a few bad choices.

¬†For the next 9 years we both lived our own lives, dated other people, I had a child, he moved away at one point but ended up back in the same city as me again. We both still caught up in person at least once a year over this period and messaged each other often. Admittedly if we both were single at the same time again, I would wonder if I should make a move again, but then something would happen, and I would again make the decision to not look at him that way and continue just being friends. ¬†About 3 years into this time gap, I met and started dating my ex (38M). I truly believed we would be together forever and this was it, I had finally found my forever person and life was good. I had told my Ex about Nate early on, and about our history and he said he trusted me, and it was fine. We got engaged and built a life.

I won‚Äôt go into too much detail about my ex. We had a fairly good relationship until we hit the 6-year mark, and then I started having doubts. I wasn‚Äôt happy and until this point I guess I thought our problems were normal couple problems. It came to a head when my mental health tanked from all the controlling and my depression, and all he could do when I tried to talk to him about it was shrug and make some stupid joke. He tried telling me this was his way of coping with stress but knowing that didn‚Äôt help when I was crying and wanted to kill myself and needed him to just be supportive. All of this stress and sadness made me realise I didn‚Äôt love him anymore, not like I used to, and made me question if he loved me at all.

I knew I couldn‚Äôt live like this anymore or I would do something dangerous to myself, so I started making arrangements to get out. I called Nate, and we caught up over coffee while my daughter played. I told him some of what was going on and asked if he thought I should leave. Really, I just needed the push to let me know I was doing the right thing. He didn‚Äôt say I should leave but told me about his similar experiences and that gave me comfort that I was doing the right thing. At this same meet up he told me how he was looking for a new job. I had just signed onto a farm my sisters partner owned, and I told him he should apply too as they needed a part time cover.

Fast forward a few months and I am moved out and living on the farm I am working on with my daughter, and Nate has also moved into a house on the sister farm next door. At one point with house shuffling, we lived together for a month, but it was completely platonic, we had separate rooms. We hung out like we used to after work, watched movies and played card games. I was trying to work through stuff with my ex but for all the talk, nothing ever changed. I was also very transparent about Nate working with me and the fact that we lived together for a bit but told my ex ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt have to worry about Nate, we are just good friend‚Äôs‚Äô. I told him I wasn‚Äôt in the frame of mind for a relationship atm, which was true. I genuinely believed Nate and I would never end up being a couple, and tbh it was even on my mind at this point.

¬† It became apparent there was no saving the relationship with my ex and I stopped going around to visit or stay the night. A few months after this, and approx. 10-11 months after the breakup, Nate and I started to become closer than just friends. We did start sleeping together and it crossed over into more of a situationship, since we hung out so much and had started sleeping together. During this time the tightly bottled emotions I had tied down for years came flowing out again. After this had been going on for six months, I decided enough was enough, I couldn‚Äôt have a noncommitted relationship with someone I felt so strongly about. I gave myself 3 more days to pretend it was all okay and then I was going to break it off. The same night that I came to this conclusion I arrived at his house to stay the night (my daughter was at a friend‚Äôs house for a sleepover) and long story short, to my complete surprise, he asked me out!

¬† Now we have been dating for a year, which I know isn‚Äôt that long, but I have never been happier. Our communication is amazing, we love each other so much, it is better than I ever thought it could be. We do have arguments of course, and disagree about things, but we always come back together afterwards and work it out. We actively listen to what each other has to say. It feels like we have been together for longer because we already know each other so well.

¬† My ex (who still sees my daughter) had a go at me a few weeks ago about how I had run off with the guy who I said never to worry about and asked how long I had been planning the whole thing. I do feel really bad about how it looks, but that isn‚Äôt what happened. Am I the a-hole?",1,1756871797.0,ThreadTalkPodcast,0,1.0,False

Took it at 8pm before my workout and then couldn't sleep until 4am.

Annoying that it's not shown in the front of the packaging but I have learnt my lesson and won't be using it ever again.

The worst part is I got maybe 3hours of sleep and am supposed to go for a job interview today. So I don't think that's going to go well since I feel both tired and still buzzing on caffeine a little bit.

We moved across the US a few months ago for my wife‚Äôs work. My company has policy that internal candidates can only apply to one role at a time for ‚Äúfairness‚Äù

So four months ago; I see an opening for a role two tiers above where I am now. I reach out to that role‚Äôs hiring manager to see who the backfill loss is (If they know). It‚Äôs for the city we‚Äôre moving to and I get set up to meet with the local VP who‚Äôs on the hiring team. 

Great hour long coffee chat, get also set up with two of the current managers to see if it‚Äôs a good fit. Meeting ends with the note the role won‚Äôt interview until July 1st when the new fiscal year starts. 

Wait the few weeks since we‚Äôre moving (no issue on the delay). One week after we‚Äôre settled in, role officially opens and get asked for the first interview the next day.

First interview goes well, get emphatically told that they will schedule as soon as possible, but there is a hiccup. Local VP has actually left for a competitor, so they‚Äôre going to need to fill their role before the next interview can happen. Since the good vibes, say ok and patiently wait. See multiple less interesting but still qualified for roles come and be filled during the month.

3 weeks later, new VP has been announced, but they‚Äôre on paternity leave for 2 weeks.

So patiently wait for them to get settled in for 2 weeks. Still no scheduling for next round.

My current director actually reaches out and asks for an update to see if they‚Äôve decided to go with someone else, and if so, to let me know due to our one application policy.

Get an immediate ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt do that! We just have one other candidate to interview!‚Äù

Two weeks more go by.

Get an automated email from over the weekend that they went with someone else. 

Never even met the new VP so asking for feedback is impossible(again company policy for internal hires is for a face to face with feedback if not selected), since they didn‚Äôt do the interview, but made the choice to not go with me for the position.

* **Monthly meal plans** so you can order once and have everything set up in advance for better value.

Examples from our menu:

* **Signature Sandwich (Halal)** ‚Äì Chicken breast, veggies, halal mozzarella, spiced sauce.
* **Vegan Bowl** ‚Äì Hummus, rice, greens, veggies, salad topper, edamame.

So this first part of the story will be kinda from my pov before finding everything out. a few weeks back, i started dating a guy from my hometown. i‚Äôm in college now and live about 5 hours away from home, but this guy and i were willing to put in the effort required for a long distance relationship. we shared attraction for each other in high school. after he got out of his last relationship that was really hard for him, he reached out to me. we started dating about two weeks ago, which i know is a short time, but i‚Äôm unfortunately known for rushing into things that seem too good to be true. 
everything was amazing. we were facetiming every morning and night. i went back home for a weekend and that friday he took me on the most amazing date ever. he bought me flowers, got me my favorite coffee, made me a basket of fuzzy socks and all the candies that i love. he even made me candied pecans because i wasnt able to get them at the gas station i usually stop at on the way up. then we went back to his house (that he owns) and watched both of our favorite movies, and then he made me dinner. filet fucking mignon! it felt perfect. sunday, when i was leaving to come back to college, he said that he realized he just wasn‚Äôt ready for anything too serious and didn‚Äôt wanna hurt me but wanted to be honest. i greatly appreciated that. so we didn‚Äôt talk for a whole 3 days, and he reached back out to me again. i ended up going back home the next weekend for labor day and to spend time with him. it was once again amazing, everything i ever wanted. and we also had all the big talks about our possible future together. then, when i left yesterday (monday) the same thing happened. he cut things off saying that he wasn‚Äôt ready. i let him know that i couldn‚Äôt keep doing the back and forth and that the next time he reaches out he better actually be ready, but to take all the time he needs. he apologizes again and says that next time he comes back, it‚Äôll be for good. so i leave it at that until around midnight last night when i get a message from his ex that he recently split up with. 

this is the fun part. turns out, he had been dating me and still talking and sleeping with her the entire time. including the short amount of time i wasnt at his house this past weekend to spend time with my family. his ex informs me of all of this and tells me that he said that our relationship means nothing to him. that he‚Äôs just using me to get over her and it‚Äôs not working. 

the real kicker is, he had told me that things with this girl was serious. like he had bought a ring serious. but he didn‚Äôt want her in his life anymore. he wanted me. ofc all of that was a lie because, (according to the ex and confirmed by him) the day after we started dating, he showed up at her doorstep and proposed to her. she said no ofc and he came back to me. 

i‚Äôm at the point where i just don‚Äôt even know what to say. i‚Äôm in utter disbelief. i blocked him on everything. i didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt ask why or what he was thinking, just got him out of my life because i know i deserve so much better. 

but yeah. that‚Äôs been my past 24 hours. my whole world is turned upside down and i don‚Äôt know what to say or do or think. ",1,1756871152.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I did go to my dentist for a good cleaning prior to having my braces placed but unfortunately I ended up never seeing him again and just going for wire adjustments but even my wire adjustmens were pushed bk due pregnancy/birth.
I ended up leaving my job in 2021 after the birth of my baby. I had paid off my braces so I was still going in for adjustments but I lost my work insurance and ended up on Medicaid..but it didn't cover much for adults for dental.My mental health was not the best at this time & I lacked in brushing/flossing but I was super close to closing my gap & my bottom teeth was finally straight.
I was near the end of treatment when I noticed that I was gradually unable to chew on my left side, my teeth looked very ""skinny"" and my gums hurt all the time esp when I flossed. I brought it up to my orthodontist who just told me that my gums were irritated and to floss more. I did this but it seemed to make it worse. I would floss , and brush once a day but weekends I struggled to even brush at all tbh.
Fast-forward to the end of 2023 I started working again and got my insurance back & I ended up going to my dentist who unsurprisingly found that I had moderate pero. Since then I have had 3 perio cleanings. I had to have my wires off for a bit to have the cleanings done but due to work stress/life I pretty much went almsot anger year out of my wire making my gap open again. I had my first adjustment this past summer since getting my wires back on.  my orthodontist told me that it's important to finish treatment so I won't cause anymore damage to my teeth. Hearing that really scared me and made things insanely real. I am scheduled for my last deep scaling n feb.(I've had to keep rescheduling due to cost/work)
I am nervous I will have to do all of the deep cleanings over again because it's been  awhile since my last 3 scallings. Also,it is a bit expensive even w/my work insurance. To make matters worse Ive noticed that everyone gags when they are around me. I am often ashamed because people will spray things around me, say things or just cover their nose.I work in a small dr. Office so the torture is real.Ive been driving myself insane for some time because hygiene wise I'm pretty decent it's just my teeth. üòÆ‚Äçüí® I realize that I prob smell aweful because of the perio. I am more aware now and use a water pik, natural toothpaste, mouthwash, coconut pull once a week(is that enough?), I chew cloves but sometimes it leaves my gums feeling irritated. I scrape my tongue.I drank water but I am a sucker for iced coffee. I am still trying to work up to being consistent w/brushing 2/3 times a day but tbh it's so hard. 
I also use flossers for braces which does help but sometimes it feels that my gums are even more angrier. When I use my water flosser it hurts sometimes. I don't have any visible rotting or decaying teeth.but front front teeth has lost some bone & I have noticed my jaw line looks different.
 What are some ways to get the perio under control? Any suggestions on daily brushing and flossing? I know that sounds stupid but I am audhd and often times I'm lucky to brush at least once a day. I am so so ashamed of this and I realize that I have been in braces for way to long & I'm scared of losing my teeth. Please be kind.I realize my own involvement in this mess & since have talked about it w/my therapist. I really don't want to lose my teeth. Can perio make you smell bad?

I‚Äôve been troubled by the side effects of caffeine in the past, especially losing sleep if I drink coffee after 3pm. Here‚Äôs my personal story: when I go out, say, at a restaurant or caf√©, and ask for decaf, they either don‚Äôt offer it or have very limited selection. Even at a friend‚Äôs dinner party, for example, I usually crave coffee after a meal, but most of the time (if not all) people only have regular coffee at home. So I end up settling for water or other drinks, which I‚Äôm okay with but not really a fan of.

I don‚Äôt have a machine to brew coffee myself, but the instant decaf coffee on the market just tastes so bad. So I‚Äôve been stuck with bad decaf coffee for years.

Until not too long ago, I started to develop the idea of making a good decaf coffee of my own, one that tastes just as good as regular coffee, and can be carried anywhere so I no longer need to resist my craving after a meal. I‚Äôve made good progress to come up with a few coffee varieties, each with different roast levels and tasting notes, and crystallizing them into instant powder so they can be individually packed and enjoyed anytime, anywhere.

Since then, my life's changed for the better, knowing that I can finally enjoy a good cup of coffee on my own terms, whenever and wherever I want (hooray for a cup at night!). If you're interested in knowing more, you can DM me or comment.

Just curious, does anyone else here struggle with the same lack of good decaf options?",1,1756870691.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I‚Äôm walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don‚Äôt pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren‚Äôt far behind
being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre
a wolf?‚Äù Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.",1,1756870657.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Every once in a while, the work drops off and we have nothing official to do. 

Generally, this is when we disassemble and clean the equipment, re-organize and inventory the stock room, clear out old and outdated materials, and basically make work to stay busy. 

Angela is feeling much more confident this week, and she is already mastering the complexities of the bindery machine. Its almost like she was born to run that thing. She even made a few guesses and suggestions that were more than what Megan knew how to do. 

I usually disassemble the main typewriter, the printograph, and the multi-ream copier, but we are due for some major part replacements, and they are too big to keep in our little supply room.  

Jasper had the requisition papers from me, and co-signed by Mr M√•rt√Ænƒól, first thing this evening around 5:30. It was getting to be around midnight-thirty and he still wasn't back, so I had been going thru my workspace and spiffing things up a bit. I admit I was slacking off when I got to my cubby of old loose papers, but the crumbly old mimeograph from Emily caught my eye; ""How to Recognize That You Are Being Indoctrinated."" Oh what the heck. I always work thru the stupid official break time that I never notice starting, so they can't say too much about me sitting back and reading something for fun - it was only two pages after all. 

I pulled the discolored pages out from where I had stuffed them into the cubby and immediately realized my mistake - they began to disintegrate as soon as I moved them. I quickly let them go, turned off my workstation fan, and went to fetch a pair of glass plates from storage. Angela was in there, doing inventory, and when she saw me, she waved a clipboard in my direction. ""Oh! Mr Olliwertson! Do you have a moment?"" She had her old anxious look back. ""I'm terribly sorry, Angela, but I am actually in the middle of a time-sensitive process - I can meet with you in about an hour?"" She looked deflated, but resigned. ""Yes sir, I'll wait."" 

Back at my desk, I set the plates down, breathed a relaxing sniff of pine, and snapped my desk fan off, looking at the swirling ancient brass fan blades with a bit of discomfort - I could have sworn that I had already turned it off. No matter. It was off now and I was excited to see this fluff and nonsense from Emily. Despite my care in transferring the crumbling pages, I lost more than half of it, as it literally fell into fiber dust under my gloved fingers. The sections that did survive were so discolored and faded as to be nearly unreadable themselves, and a final piece blew right off the desk into the lint vent, blown away by the oscillating breeze of my desk fan. I really needed to remember to turn that thing off first thing when I had delicate work to do. I snapped the toggle firmly OFF, and freed of ill breezes, I finally had the paper safely between glass panes. The ink was pale lavender-blue, a faint echo of the original bright mimeographed purple. The pages themselves were horribly stained in rusty brown - the previous owner must have been a coffee fiend. 

Well then, Emily. Let's see what peculiar content you have sent me.

Have you ever experienced that twisty feeling where you want to laugh or scoff at something for being just too ridiculous, but then the fresh scent of pine wafts by your face and you look up and that damned fan is on AGAIN. 

I've never done this, but I suddenly feel an overwhelming need for fresh air. I need to get outside, to get some more air, everything is too close and too hot and this desk is so stuffy and closed-in... I feel myself reaching for the toggle switch on the fan and from what seems like a great and foggy distance, my fingers snap it to HIGH. 

-""Bzzzzzzzzzzz Angela 37 to Mr M√•rt√Ænƒól's office. Angela 37 to Mr M√•rt√Ænƒól's office please. zzzzzzzzzzT"" The sound of the intercom snapped me back to myself, looking up from my desk at the wrinkled and concerned face of Jasper, with his trolley of parts behind him. ""You doin' ok, Mr Ollie Sir? Pardon my saying so, but you look a little green around the gills, one might say."" I swiped my hands across my face and breathed deep. The relaxing pine scent wafted comfortably from the slowly moving fan blades, and I looked down, intending to laugh at that silly paper - whatever it was that had gotten me so worked up, but the glass plates were empty as the void in my memory. Wasn't I looking at something from my odds-and-ends cubby? But when I glanced up, expecting the chaotic pile of papers and whatnot, I was surprised to see a perfectly neat and almost totally empty storage cube. I remember planning on organizing it, but ... I can't remember actually doing it, and surely I wouldn't have thrown everything out? I looked down at my wastepaper basket and it was pristine and empty. I looked over at Jasper and his eyes had gone cold and narrow, despite the concern in his voice. ""Quite green, Mr Ollie. You just sit for a spell"" - he reached over and snapped the toggle on my fan to HIGH again - ""Don't you fret none. I'll handle the replacement parts this time for ya."" I breathed pine and for a brief second, I knew it for the scent of forgetfulness.

Megan was looking a bit frustrated when we crossed paths at the coffee machine at 7am. ""Anything I can help you with?"" I asked cheerfully. It had been a good night. My desk was cleared, the office cleaned and freshened up, the machine parts were all replaced and calibrated, and we were ready for the inevitable deluge of jobs that always came after a pause. ""Well Sir, it's Angela. She got called out to Mr M√•rt√Ænƒól's office, but it's been hours and hours and she hasn't come back. I wouldn't bother you about it, Sir, but, well she took the key to the supply closet with her and you know it's the only one we have since we lost Heather. I was checking up the backup tape printer and it needs some toner. I just hate leaving things unfinished."" I patted her shoulder. Megan was really a treasure. ""No worries, I'll just pop across and get it from her real quick. Maybe even mention to M√•rt√Ænƒól that an extra key would be grand.""

I paused at the door to the hallway. Such a strange time to feel queasy, but perhaps dinner (what had I eaten for dinner?) wasn't sitting quite right. I turned the handle, and the door opened into the hallway. I looked over at M√•rt√Ænƒól's office door. There were shadows in the frosted glass that ... I opened the door to the hallway, and looked carefully and specifically at the brass handle of M√•rt√Ænƒól's door. I took two short paces across the faded paisley carpet, and knocked briskly, keeping my eyes carefully away from the frosted glass. 

""Come in, Ollie, come in!"" Mr M√•rt√Ænƒól was in the middle of his office floor, obviously mid-pacing, and Angela was sitting on a little stool off to the side of his desk. She looked a bit dazed, but definitely less anxious. ""Sir, Angela."" I nodded to them both and waved away M√•rt√Ænƒól's offer of a seat. ""I am so sorry to interrupt, I just needed to get our supply room key."" M√•rt√Ænƒól smiled broadly, ""well you're in luck, I've kept my old officemate *Angel* away from her work long enough, you can be a gentleman and escort her back!"" Angel stood up, slightly wobbly, and I proffered my arm. She took it and leaned heavily on me, and I waved goodbye to M√•rt√Ænƒól. As I turned back to the door, I could have sworn I saw Angel's terrified face pressed against the far side of the frosted glass ... I turned toward the door, carefully looking at the door handle, and Angel and I stepped back across the hallway into our workroom. 

I felt bad for making Megan wait until the start of a new shift for her toner, so as soon as I seated Angel down at the bindery equipment, only a little late because of the visit to M√•rt√Ænƒól's office, I walked over and turned the key to the supply room, headed for the toner area for Megan's requisition. Halfway back, I tripped and nearly fell over something on the floor. I hadn't seen the brown clipboard against the reddish brown tiles in the dim light of early evening. I picked it up, and was thinking about how harsh to be to Angel about leaving trip hazards, when I flipped it over, and in red grease pen on the blank inventory sheet was scrawled ""My name is Angelica. I am from Floor 19. I can't go down to the Basement again, I just can't!""

Can we talk about no code automation for a moment? Because honestly, I can‚Äôt get over what‚Äôs happening! Every week there‚Äôs another tool, another update ‚Äì and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if we‚Äôre living through the dawn of a whole new working era. 

I remember dreading repetitive tasks (raise your hand if you KNOW the pain of spreadsheet double-entry!) and now, in 2024, I just drag, drop, and connect. No anxiety, no crying over macros. Just pure focus on What Actually Matters.

Some wild benefits I‚Äôve personally experienced:

- **Speed:** What used to take half a day can now take five minutes.
- **Creativity:** People with zero coding experience are solving problems in unique ways that coders never saw coming.
- **Democratization:** Access! It's not just devs and IT anymore ‚Äì anyone on the team can automate.

Here are the most jaw-dropping things I‚Äôve seen automated, by people who never wrote a single line of code:

- Daily inbox sorting (Imagine 100s of emails tagged and sent where they belong before you sit down with your coffee! ‚òïÔ∏è)
- Complex sales pipeline management with conditional notifications and project boards.
- Automatic content curation and social media scheduling, freeing up actual creative time. 

As someone genuinely excited about all things efficiency, I keep asking myself:
Are we seeing the very beginning of a workplace where literally **anyone** gets to build their ideal flow?

I see a few huge implications here, and I‚Äôd love YOUR thoughts!
---
- **What does this mean for traditional developer roles?** Will devs become ‚Äòsystem architects‚Äô while the rest are ‚Äòbuilders‚Äô?
- **Do we start to expect individual employees to optimize their own work?** (I am here for empowering admin staff, but curious what happens when everyone‚Äôs a maker.)
- **Does no code automation level the playing field‚Äîor leave non-adopters in the dust?** Let's face it, once you go no-code, going back is rough! üòÖ
---

There is so much energy (borderline giddiness, tbh) around these platforms, but big question: Are we racing toward a future dream, or am I getting too hyped?

Would love to hear how no code automation, big or small, has changed YOUR world, team, or even your day! 

What‚Äôs the coolest workflow you‚Äôve built, or what‚Äôs your wish list for automation? I‚Äôm all ears‚Äîlet‚Äôs swap some ideas!

No?

Well, I do. So, without further ado, here‚Äôs a one-shot about how things would probably turn out if experienced mercenaries behaved like office workers.

**Genre: Action/Satire/Slice of Life**

**\~ \~ \~**

It was a bright and sunny morning. Or so I wished.

No. It was a stormy Monday morning, with thunderclouds darker than my mood and rain heavier than my eyelids. It was the perfect weather to sleep in. Or read a book. Or enjoy a cup of tea. Or do literally anything else that didn‚Äôt involve leaving the house.

Yet here I was, commuting to work like every other day.

The private van was a comfortable ride, if nothing else. It was basically a metal box on wheels, with darkened windows that shielded its occupants from the world and a dynamic suspension system which reduced virtually any engine rumblings.

Thankfully, I was the last person scheduled to arrive for the mission, so I had the entire vehicle to myself. It was better that way; I was in no mood to speak to anyone today. Or any other day, in fact. Work wouldn‚Äôt be the place where one would find me in the most pleasant of moods.

I checked my watch and groaned; it was barely nine in the morning. And here I was, already planning what to have for lunch.

Thunder cracked as the van cruised to a stop.

My tactical boots sent a small puddle splashing onto the leather seats as I took a step out of the vehicle. The boringly normal office building ahead of me looked like all the others around, other than the fact that its roof was on fire. I sighed as the van drove off.

Time to get to work.

A barely audible whirring caught my ears despite the muted clatter of gunfire on the other end of the steel doors as I attached the standard-issue decryption device to the highly secure lock. The circular decryptor flashed yellow a few times before turning a bright green. I pushed open the doors and strolled into Nova Incorporated‚Äôs Headquarters.

‚ÄúMorning, Dave,‚Äù I greeted the man crouching behind a cabinet as the sound of gunfire multiplied at least tenfold.

‚ÄúMorning, Carol. How was your weekend?‚Äù

Dave was dressed in the exact same dark tactical uniform as I was, and his assault rifle was slung loosely by his side. There was an almost bored look on his face as the guards on the other end continued spraying bullets over our heads.

‚ÄúSame old, same old.‚Äù I leaned up against a support pillar beside him, checking my rifle to make sure it was fully loaded. ‚ÄúFamily day with the kids. My husband drove us to the theme park.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù

I peeked from my cover, catching a glimpse of the enemy. No less than fifty guards were tearing up the entire main hall with heavy cover fire. They sure were an enthusiastic lot. It was almost as though they were lining up to die.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I shrugged, pulling a fragmentation grenade from my collar pocket and tossing it over my head. ‚ÄúThe kids never seem to get bored of it.‚Äù

A deafening explosion tore through the whole hall, sending tremors through the entire building. The gunfire stopped.

Dave stood up and moved from his cover, aiming his weapon forward. ‚ÄúEh, they‚Äôll grow out of it someday.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSome day, huh? That day had better come soon. Being a working mom *sucks*,‚Äù I sighed wistfully, following close behind. ‚ÄúMan, these corpses are everywhere. What a crappy Monday to start our week.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt seem that different from any other Monday.‚Äù My colleague pulled out an electronic wrench and began prying open the next set of doors.

A message flashed across my visor. I glanced at it before letting out a clearly audible groan of exasperation.

‚ÄúClient rushing you again?‚Äù Dave asked without turning back. ‚ÄúMan, they really have got no patience.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs my Head of Department.‚Äù The doors opened with a soft hiss, and a complicated array of moving lasers greeted us warmly. ‚ÄúJust another one of those ‚ÄòHi‚Äô messages with no context. Early in the morning, too. What a thoughtless jerk.‚Äù

I flipped over the first set of lasers, landing on the temporarily empty space as softly as I could. Dave followed suit, rolling under his set of glowing death and somersaulting over the next. Thankfully, the laser room was barely twelve square metres, which meant we didn‚Äôt have to spend too long making our way through this tedious security system.

‚ÄúYou know Charlie‚Äôs just trying to get you to call him, right?‚Äù Dave said, hopping over to a nearby computer and deactivating the laser grid.

‚ÄúI know, but I won‚Äôt.‚Äù I swiped away the flashing message. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got enough shit to deal with now. It‚Äôs not my problem that he doesn‚Äôt bother to read my mission reports.‚Äù

The lift doors in front of me opened after a few more seconds of keyboard clattering. Dave and I walked in, keeping our silence as it brought us to another floor. The chrome doors opened to the sound of gunshots and knuckles on flesh.

In front of us stood Captain America himself, or at least someone who *thought* he was Captain America.

‚ÄúLook at Benson go,‚Äù Dave said sarcastically, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúDude‚Äôs trying way too hard.‚Äù

‚ÄòCaptain America‚Äô, or Benson, was in the middle of engaging five armed guards in hand-to-hand combat at the same time. Behind him lay about twenty other guards, either groaning in pain on the floor or just straight-up unconscious. Benson‚Äôs firearms were strewn on the floor, but so were his opponents‚Äô weapons.

‚ÄúOf course, he‚Äôs really gunning for a promotion,‚Äù I commented, watching Benson dislocate a guard‚Äôs arm, break another‚Äôs neck, and knock one out, all at the same time. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just bought that new expensive mansion for no reason other than to show it off to his family.‚Äù

‚ÄúTch, how childish.‚Äù

A grunt escaped from behind Benson‚Äôs mask as he staggered back from a well-placed kick, but he caught the next and flipped his opponent onto the floor savagely. His fist connected with the poor man‚Äôs jaw, knocking the guard out with a resounding thud.

‚ÄúI heard his wife thinks he could do better with this mercenary job, so he‚Äôs trying his best to make sure she doesn‚Äôt leave him.‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúBut all she does is kick her feet up at home and do nothing else. If anyone‚Äôs childish, it‚Äôs his wife.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost makes me feel sorry for him. Then again, he chose her,‚Äù Dave said, slowly walking forward with his pistol raised. ‚ÄúOh, look, he‚Äôs almost done.‚Äù

The gun barked twice as the last guard standing fell over with two holes in the back of his head.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Benson grunted almost incoherently before running down the hallway. I really hope he didn‚Äôt hear what Dave and I were talking about earlier.

A few demolition charges were planted on a wall at the end of the hallway. They were blinking red, and the small monitors in their centre read ‚ÄòData synchronisation in progress: Fifty per cent complete‚Äô.

I blinked and turned on my heel, heading to the office pantry instead. The Tech & Demolition department was ahead of us for once. Looks like I didn‚Äôt need to manually sync up the office data before blowing up the building.

The smell of coffee drifted to my nose before the two department supports, Alice and Stephanie, came into view. Unfortunately, Benson saw them before I did, and his frankly annoying voice soon filled up the tiny pantry space.

‚ÄúAre you two skiving off again?‚Äù He crossed his arms. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt see how you can turn up to this office, all happy-go-lucky, as giddy as ever, big smiles on your faces. Our company isn‚Äôt doing well, and you‚Äôre still in the mood to slack off? How much do you even want to be here? And Alice, weren‚Äôt you out sick the whole of last week? How can you not give a shit about your contribution to this company?‚Äù

Alice faked a cough and continued sipping her coffee as though she hadn‚Äôt heard him. Stephanie flipped her hair carelessly and continued scrolling on her phone.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm talking to you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, Benson. Shut the hell up. It‚Äôs barely eleven in the morning,‚Äù Dave said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt get the job done. Just because you‚Äôre trying to be the Head of Department doesn‚Äôt mean you already are. Have some professional courtesy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSlackers don‚Äôt deserve courtesy. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm surrounded by so many lazy people,‚Äù Benson snapped back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting this promotion, no matter what. I don‚Äôt have the energy to carry around useless baggage who don‚Äôt contribute.‚Äù

*Projecting, much?*

The sound of the two men arguing faded into the background as I poured myself a cup of coffee as well. By the looks of things, I was going to need it. I barely had five hours of sleep last night, and it looked like I had a long day ahead of me.

Unfortunately, my boss had chosen to call right before I could put the cup to my lips. I groaned audibly and picked up the call.

‚Äú*Carol, why didn‚Äôt you call me back?*‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask me to,‚Äù I replied, stirring my cup of coffee gently.

‚Äú*I sent you a message earlier‚Äî Never mind that for now. Alan from Finance and Logistics asked me a few questions in our daily meeting earlier. Why did you order ten tactical EMPs for the heist mission last week? Didn‚Äôt we agree on five EMPs?*‚Äù

‚ÄúIntel made a mistake; the compound was a lot bigger than anticipated. Only found that out during my personal recce visit the day before,‚Äù I answered lazily. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already gotten approval from the Chief Tactical Officer beforehand, so all the logistics were already settled.‚Äù

‚Äú*What? Why didn‚Äôt you let me know?*‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I sent you an email, but you were on your annual leave. Besides, I already included it in my mission report that I sent last Friday. You‚Äôd know about that before your meeting if you had read it.‚Äù

‚Äú*No, no, no. C‚Äômon, Carol. You have to understand that there are procedures and hierarchies in this company. If you can‚Äôt reach me, call me. If I don‚Äôt answer, keep trying until I do. You made me look bad in front of our stakeholders, dammit.*‚Äù

I took an audible sip of my coffee and rolled my eyes. I really didn‚Äôt have the energy to put up with this bullshit today.

‚ÄúDuly noted, Charlie,‚Äù I mumbled robotically, nodding at Stephanie, who was gesturing to an imaginary watch. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs nothing else, I‚Äôll get back to work.‚Äù

I cut the call before Charlie could answer, just in time for an ear-splitting explosion outside the pantry. My ears rang as I gripped the marble table for support. Christ, that was louder than expected.

‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs the last stretch.‚Äù Benson cocked his assault rifle and opened the pantry doors enthusiastically. ‚ÄúGo team!‚Äù

*Go fuck yourself‚Äî*

A clatter of gunfire caught him by surprise, forcing him to retreat into the room. Dave looked wildly at me, and I returned it with an equally confused look. According to our intel, we should have cleared out all the guards in this building. Where was this heavy fire coming from?

Stephanie pulled the *‚Äòwatch‚Äô* from her wrist and tossed it into the air, ever calm. With a whirlwind of metal, it transformed into a drone no larger than a bee and whizzed out of the room. Alice swiped a hologram emitting from the device on her palm, and a camera feed came in.

*What the hell?*

‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ Is that the CEO?‚Äù Dave breathed in disbelief. ‚ÄúDid he turn himself into some kind of cyborg?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeems that way.‚Äù Stephanie nodded. ‚ÄúOther than his head, there don‚Äôt seem to be any traces of organic matter. He‚Äôs practically made out of metal.‚Äù

‚ÄúSilver, to be precise,‚Äù Alice chimed in.

‚ÄúAlright, here‚Äôs the plan. Carol, you go left. Dave, you go right,‚Äù Benson commanded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll charge at him head-on with my riot shield to draw his fire. Alice, Stephanie, find a way to short-circuit his body from behind.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, great plan,‚Äù Dave said sarcastically. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre trying to get all of us killed.‚Äù

Benson glared at him.

‚ÄúThose are shotgun slugs he‚Äôs firing. At that rate of fire, your riot shield will be shredded in ten seconds, tops.‚Äù Dave shook his head. ‚ÄúMight I remind you that Carol and I are from the weapons department here? You may be a Team Lead, but you‚Äôre still from the Close Quarters Combat department; you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

I grabbed Dave‚Äôs arm, shaking my head slightly. ‚ÄúNot the time, Dave. Not the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, genius. Tell us what to do, then.‚Äù Benson glanced at the doors as the hailstorm of bullets got significantly louder. ‚ÄúYou have twenty seconds.‚Äù

Dave pursed his lips. Alice and Stephanie looked at each other nervously.

‚ÄúHis body is made of silver, right?‚Äù I spoke up. ‚ÄúSo we use that to our advantage. What‚Äôs silver most useful for?‚Äù

Dave‚Äôs eyes lit up with understanding. Benson tilted his head, nodding slightly. The two ladies giggled.

‚ÄúAlright, Benson.‚Äù I turn to the man. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Team Lead. Your call.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fucking go.‚Äù

Without hesitation, Stephanie tossed another pack of demolition charges, which stuck themselves onto the ceiling. Everyone huddled towards Benson, who swiftly deployed his riot shield and hung it over our heads.

An explosion rang, barely audible over the sound of approaching gunfire.

Rubble collapsed onto the shield with loud thuds, accompanied by the clattering of rain on metal. I looked up at the hole in the ceiling. As expected, we were only one floor below the roof, and it was still thundering hard.

Perfect.

The last of our makeshift team grappled onto the roof just as the cyborg-like CEO of Nova Incorporated burst through the pantry. It took him a hilarious few seconds to figure out what we just did, before he jumped to the roof as well.

‚ÄúNowhere to run, soldiers of fortune,‚Äù the bald man snarled, his yellowish teeth a stark contrast to the sleek-looking brush gun coloured exoskeleton, which had already taken the place of his human body. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll pay for destroying my company!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh please, I don‚Äôt even get paid enough for this,‚Äù I spat, flipping out of the way as the cyborg swung wildly in my direction.

The others followed suit as the CEO released a war cry, erratically firing what looked like machine shotguns in place of where his hands should have been.

Alice and Stephanie cowered behind a metal bulwark that Benson had deployed, occasionally firing electronic scramblers at the enraged cyborg. Dave danced around the bullets like a hyperactive acrobat while Benson took every chance he could to push the enemy back.

I, on the other hand, was only here to do one thing.

The cyborg screamed in both fury and pain as a piece of metal lodged itself deep in the back of his neck. Without wasting a second, I pulled out the metre-long antenna and leapt off his shoulders.

And then I waited.

‚ÄúYou little shit!‚Äù The CEO turned his full attention to me, ignoring the metal wire in his body. ‚ÄúCome back here so I can pinch your little head off‚Äî‚Äù

Light flooded my vision as another explosion practically deafened my ears. Except that it wasn‚Äôt an explosion.

It was thunder. The Heavens had struck down our enemy for us. After all, the CEO had chosen to make his new body out of silver, the most conductive type of metal.

I watched the charred corpse collapse limply to the ground as my colleagues gathered around. Dave was beaming at me. Benson kept a neutral expression, probably ticked off at how he wasn‚Äôt the hero in this mission. Alice and Stephanie sat on the wet floor, leaning against the parapet wall.

Me? I checked my watch and cracked a small smile.

It was finally lunchtime.

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I‚Äôm walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don‚Äôt pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren‚Äôt far behind
being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre
a wolf?‚Äù Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.",1,1756869456.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

Just right - not too light, not too much pigment. It blended well and lasted well (I applied over my setting powder today) - I even had a colleague stop me and comment on my blush!  I found it a little spendy at $34, but it has SPF? üòò it won‚Äôt be my top priority, but I would def try another shade.
Of the three blushes I bought in my last haul, I‚Äôd rate them: Ilia, Ciele, Kosas

This Sephora collection lip oil in Cherry had a nice texture - not thick or sticky, very smooth application, the faintest hint of color and awesome shine - I had a girl in the ladies room comment on this as I was reapplying.  This would be my only gripe - while it‚Äôs not heavy or uncomfortable, it felt like it just sat on top of my lips - so it was definitely all over my coffee cup and it came off easily. I felt like I was reapplying this all day.  But for $10, I think it‚Äôs a nice option for people who don‚Äôt mind reapplying.
Of the three lippies I got in that haul, I‚Äôd rate them: Kulfi, Sarah Creal, Sephora collection

health background - ehlers danlos, pots. have had constipation episodes before but all alleviated within three days 


SITUATION: on Tuesday of last week after buying a box of tea I used hot water from the family coffee Keurig to make a cup before I went to bed, I removed a coffee pod before running the hot water that I assumed it only been there a day. 

within an hour of this, immediate abdominal and stomach pain. sweats, asked the family when the last time the coffee machine had been used and they had informed me that the pod had been sitting in there with moisture for around 2 weeks. went to the ER and they conducted blood tests and tried to get a stool sample, I could not provide a stool sample as for some reason, very suddenly I could not even Force out anything. felt almost immediate 

the next day, more of the same. inability to pass anything for the whole day, ate clean foods and hydrated properly as I usually do. the pain that had been there from the previous day persisted, so I just took some ibuprofen, ate some raw garlic and went to bed. this was the first full day with no movement so I didn't really think much of it. 
two days on from that end things persisted the same, no bowel movements at all for 3 days now, on the third day I'm able to pass a small soft movement but only ones, it is miniscule. pain gets worse. go to ER that night where they do a dry CT and tell me that from what they could see the stool presence wasn't bad. told me to do a liquid diet for 2 days, so I did 

nothing changed in my symptoms with the liquid diet, started incorporating soft foods, made it very much worse. try everything, magnesium, stool softener, oil enemas and saline enemas, nothing. 
going on 6 days now without a bowel movement, only passing small minuscule soft pieces. I become suspect of some kind of infection? I know some intestinal infections can present with constipation and not diarrhea, I am suspect of this at the moment currently and I'm leaning towards it, been constipated a bit in my life but it's always resolved with proper treatment. when I went to the ER the first time they denied me any kind of antibiotic


last night I go to another ER where they perform a x-ray and tell me that there is a decent stool presence but are not suspect of an impaction, some pelvic blood clots are seen, maybe from straining so much? 

which brings us to today, have tried everything, more suppositories, electrolytes, more citrate nothing. I have never had constipation like this in my life and when I have it's been dealt with promptly, usually through one enema. the sudden onset of my symptoms after consuming contaminated food is what's worrisome, has anyone ever been through anything like this? does anyone think it could be constipation from an infection? if so has anyone tried any remedies, I will be trying some antimicrobial supplements (oregano oil) tomorrow. this is the longest I've ever gone without a substantial Bell movement and it's incredibly painful, very scary. I want this to hopefully be over, any words at all would be greatly appreciated :) apologies for the rambling


TLDR; sudden onset aggressive constipation after drinking water that had been run through a contaminated machine, no alleviation for 8 days of symptoms. only passing minuscule soft deposits every other day. Suspicious of infection. Looking for any help !

Instead of opening the box to check he asked me if I had brought my car. When I said I did he said his dad asked him to send pictures of the MacBook by putting it on top of my car. Didn‚Äôt make sense to me. I said no. I told him he can take a picture or check on Apple website. I was searching for the bill on my phone but couldn‚Äôt find it and he was texting on the phone. Said he will go to washroom and be back. 

I have put the device back in my backpack, he came back and asked for device, I said it‚Äôs inside and wait till I find the bill. He was growing impatient and asking to hold the MacBook. I told him I don‚Äôt feel
Comfortable and can meet him tomorrow at Apple store or at police station. He was giving me excuses like he doesn‚Äôt have a car etc. I told him I can meet at police station and excused myself. 

Waited for him to leave and after sometime I looked into the parking lot and when I felt safe I went into my car and drove away.

In retrospect, I felt it was an ambush. Would runaway with my MacBook from the parking lot.

Here‚Äôs my unpopular opinion: you should only tell your deepest secrets to strangers you‚Äôll never meet again.

When you confide in family members, friends, or associates, you give them crucial insights that can one day be leveraged against you. Strangers don‚Äôt hang around or snoop ‚Äî they‚Äôll be gone within minutes, hours, or at worst, days. They won‚Äôt waste energy exposing you, especially if your conversation happened at an airport, coffee shop, bar or some anonymous online forum.

If there‚Äôs ever a chance encounter after you‚Äôve shared your darkest fears or ugliest flaws, they‚Äôll probably question their own memory: ‚ÄúIs that the person I spoke to a while back?‚Äù Even those with photographic memories who fully recognize you will be too busy with their own lives and problems to care or interact again.

Let‚Äôs say by some improbable chance they did share your information with someone you know. The people in your circle wouldn‚Äôt believe a random person claiming you told them vital details. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to fathom why you‚Äôd tell intimate secrets to a stranger. If they do believe it and grasp onto whatever negative information they heard, be thankful ‚Äî a so-called ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who wants to believe the worst about you is simply exposing their true nature. That‚Äôs a rare gift of confirmation, solidifying a glimpse beyond their fake persona to know exactly where you stand in your relationship.

The information won‚Äôt be credible anyway. Anyone told would ask, ‚ÄúWhere did you hear that?‚Äù The answer: ‚ÄúHe told some person at a bar, and they told me.‚Äù Who would believe that nonsense? An easy strategy is to brush off the accusation as pure hearsay ‚Äî the perfect defense keeping the main point intact that strangers in unfamiliar areas are the best people to divulge your deepest and darkest secrets, if you need someone to talk to.

**Finding the Right Strangers**

https://preview.redd.it/1j7eezss1vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1508186bd32d459c3c3cde9a362c7e7cf2e5aa

Throughout my life, I‚Äôve traveled more than most, less than few. Finding myself passing by large cities where no one cares to remember one moment to the next, or some local dive spot in the middle of east bumble f\*\*k. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve traversed through a few of these cities and small towns as well. Either the sheer mass population engulfs the crowd into a whirlwind of once-in-a-lifetime interactions, or a smaller settlement where everyone has a strange resemblance as if third cousins or less. The gathering locations for the social meetup usually are set with dim lighting that aid in the fading moment they‚Äôll all but soon forget ‚Äî like so many interactions we‚Äôve all let slip into the dark void of non-importance.

When I need perspective outside my own, I test the waters in these unfamiliar places with small talk to gauge which audience member is worth engaging. I‚Äôve always had an intuitive ability to spot the good listener who‚Äôll be truthful versus the ‚Äúnice person.‚Äù With keen observation I‚Äôd find people who ask follow-up questions rather than immediately sharing their own stories. I‚Äôd notice who listens with their whole attention rather than planning their next response. These were the strangers worthy of my vulnerability. Once the target was acquired, I prepared myself not to become overly emotional when they give an unpleasant answer, remaining quiet instead of countering defensively with ‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Unlike most people, I enjoy the microscopic examinations of other‚Äôs perspectives who have no skin in the game. The stranger from a distance was the perfect observer who‚Äôd never mingled in my affairs, had no interactions with the people being discussed, which in turn created the coveted position of an objective observational status that aided in newfound perspectives. The main concern to be aware of is if the stranger becomes bored with the subject. When/if that happens, I bribe them into listening to my spiel with a free drink or two, but only if I believe they were the right person exhibiting the required attributes to add value to my lack of understanding or, better yet, ignorance.

**My Story: The Perfect Example**

https://preview.redd.it/2p8rvxhy1vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a0899783754454126d7586854dbc1eb4fdf157f

A prime example of utilizing this tactic was when I used to travel in a converted van. Those were confusing days. If the philosophy stands to be true that time doesn‚Äôt exist, and all days are happening at once, then the amount of pity and relief I have for my former self is unquantifiable. God, was I lost in a maze during those ten months. The main reason you might ask: I‚Äôd found out that the man I called ‚ÄúDad‚Äù for thirty-odd years was in fact not my father. I was lied to with a certain ease that was far from motherly love and much closer to devilish deceit.

I was enlightened with this newfound information by my older brother who divulged the truth at his son‚Äôs high school graduation party. He said, ‚ÄúMom told a few of her female friends that the timing of your conception didn‚Äôt align with when she got back together with Dad.‚Äù I asked my older brother, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me sooner?‚Äù He stated, ‚ÄúI thought you knew. They didn‚Äôt tell you? I thought they would‚Äôve.‚Äù This was a constant line he‚Äôd use to alleviate any accountability by using ignorance as a defense. Mind you, the entire story he told about multiple friends my mom told was an utter lie in itself, but I‚Äôll get to that.

When I confronted my mom over a phone call, I was met with a nonchalant, ‚ÄúHe may not be your father.‚Äù For the first time, after asking repeatedly, she finally cracked after I mentioned my older brother‚Äôs account.

For years, whenever my mother got upset with my actions, she‚Äôd pound a false narrative into my mind by echoing the hypnotic words, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like your father.‚Äù Tell a lie enough times, eventually it becomes the truth. Especially when those words come from those once held in the highest regard believing they exhibited virtues such as integrity and wisdom. They once were the pin to my compass guiding my life choices, never thinking they‚Äôd ever lead me astray.

**The Signs Were There**

https://preview.redd.it/93dcy1a32vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=940fb604111f48c08d92181237f884cabd30519f

I had a hunch since my teens that the man I‚Äôd called ‚ÄúDad‚Äù was indeed, not my father. There was only one picture of him in his early twenties where maybe, possibly, we looked slightly similar. Besides that, nothing concrete. Every family barbecue on his side of the family felt awkward. I wasn‚Äôt like them, and deep down, I knew they weren‚Äôt my family nor my tribe, but nice people nonetheless.

My older brother kept this secret from me for twenty-two years. If you haven‚Äôt guessed, I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since that day. You must understand, there were many opportunities for him to come clean. I specifically remember telling him at a dive bar in my early twenties that I was seriously considering changing my last name to our mother‚Äôs maiden name. A visible anger consumed his face met by an incredulous tone of disloyalty when he asked, ‚ÄúWhy would you want to do that?‚Äù

He knew then, and not only said nothing, but comfortably led my discernment off kilter further down a hole instead of towards the light he selfishly possessed. You may ask why? I certainly have. The best explanation I‚Äôve ever conceived was the power of knowing your true identity. Where you come from breeds a certain level of individual freedom he wanted some control over. It‚Äôs much easier to convince and misdirect someone with false ideas when believing they‚Äôre your one hundred percent blood brother.

What makes the entire situation worse were the subtle clues I subconsciously gathered about my older brother‚Äôs private conversations with my dad‚Äôs side of the family about my true identity. One example being when a group of my cousins stated, ‚ÄúYou and you‚Äôre dad have the same mannerisms.‚Äù My older brother replied, ‚ÄúThose can be learned over time.‚Äù Completely clueless to the subtext, I continued on with whatever I was speaking about.

Every family barbecue at a community park, I‚Äôd hear my dad‚Äôs airhead girlfriend mention, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look anything like your dad.‚Äù It really pissed me off, especially since he stood by her side with a weird smirk while staying silent. As if he gave her the green light to make me question my own identity. Why would he do that? Why not come clean? Why would everyone partake in some weird cult-like behavior to keep my true background a secret, and my biological father‚Äôs identity hidden?

**The Backstory: Revenge and Deception**

https://preview.redd.it/lmkrg5k92vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1431bba36195174aef3ebd7519d7f16e9a8e11b7

Before fingers get pointed for blame, you must understand: my ‚Äúdad‚Äù was a player all throughout his life. One example of just how low he was willing to go was before I was born. My mother got informed by a girlfriend that she‚Äôd seen my ‚Äúdad‚Äù driving around town in my mom‚Äôs Ford Mustang with another woman. How my mom tracked them down, I don‚Äôt know, but she did. When she confronted them, my mom ended up driving off in her Mustang leaving them both stranded on the side of the road.

My ‚Äúdad‚Äù did this multiple times, and finally my mom wanted payback. The revenge was a one-night stand with his best friend, my biological father. She kept the secret safe and sound until years later after divorcing another man who isn‚Äôt important to the story. Freshly divorced, my mom took comfort in my ‚Äúdad‚Äôs‚Äù arms. Still being the Casanova he prided himself to be, he introduced my mom to another blonde-haired female with similar characteristics to her except a much weaker version. They hit it off and became friends.

I don‚Äôt know the details on what inspired the truthful moment to transpire, but I speculate there was alcohol, maybe a night of a little cocaine and a joint or two. Whatever it was, call it destiny, my mom became overwhelmed with the weight of the lie, coming clean to this newfound blonde-haired friend about my conception being impossible for me to be my ‚Äúdad‚Äôs‚Äù son.

Yes, the one-off improbable happening, happened. Created not by some divinely loving union between two souls. Sadly, I spawned from the vices of lust and revenge. When I was born, I had an umbilical cord strangling my neck ‚Äî life‚Äôs attempt to take me out early failed for some reason. I will call it divine fate.

More importantly, after my mom revealed the truth, the blonde-haired woman told not only my ‚Äúdad,‚Äù but my older brother as well. To add another disgusting detail to this story, the blonde-haired woman was in her mid to late thirties, and not only slept with my father, but I speculate she was also sleeping with my older brother. He was nineteen at the time. Granted my older brother wasn‚Äôt your typical teenager. He was a six-foot-two, two-hundred-and-twenty-pound stud that had a charm with the ladies. Not to make any excuse for the blonde-haired woman, but it is what it is.

From that point on, my mom despised that woman, my ‚Äúdad‚Äù disappeared and I, a fifteen-year-old boy, was left in the dark about the entire situation. My ‚Äúdad‚Äù must‚Äôve reached out to my biological father because that‚Äôs when he showed up, and my mom told a half-truth about him coming around to see her. My biological father never spoke directly to me. Why? I don‚Äôt know. My best guess was knowing the nature of my mom‚Äôs vindictive tendencies when feeling threatened. I‚Äôve imagined my biological father pulling up to the house stating he‚Äôd like to speak to me, and my mom firing back in a witch‚Äôs tone used to cast a fatal spell on a mortal enemy, warning him with the one piece of leverage she had: fifteen years of back pay for child support.

https://preview.redd.it/c40x2y3h4vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2706eaf96d0697b9d7287a1a288c388d3b122c

**The Financial Reality**

Now let‚Äôs do some low-ball calculations for child support payments. Three hundred dollars a month, times fifteen years. That‚Äôs over fifty thousand dollars. Adding on to the fact he‚Äôd be placing himself on the ringer for all my needs from that day forward. No wonder why my biological father pulled the same David Copperfield trick as my ‚ÄúDad.‚Äù I don‚Äôt blame him for not taking on that responsibility when he had his own family with multiple other children.

With that being said, don‚Äôt feel bad for him either. He was no saint, and after meeting him enough times, it‚Äôs somewhat understandable why my mom didn‚Äôt want him around to begin with. To spotlight my biological father‚Äôs heinous actions, I‚Äôll tell you about a time I spoke with him in my early thirties, still unaware he was my father. The encounter was set up by my ‚Äúdad‚Äù and older brother knowingly bringing us together at his apartment.

There was a point where it was only my biological father and I sitting in the living room. This man admitted to blowing weed smoke in my face as an infant to stop my crying. He laughed as if he‚Äôd said the funniest thing ever. Dumbfounded, I sat in silence, without knowing how to act accordingly to the disturbing information. And that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt blame my mother for shielding my identity as a child.

This man was a bold-faced liar, manipulator, and as selfish as they come. He was divorced by his wife for telling an old high school flame he‚Äôd happen to see at a supermarket that his wife who was alive and well, had recently died from cancer. Lying about being a new widower, he asked to take her out on a date. This man lied with a casual ease of flossing corn from his teeth.

**Finding Strangers to Talk To**

All this convoluted information were fragmented pieces to a puzzle shaded in half-truths that inhibited any chance in solving the entire mystery. Without confidence in any of my immediate family, I picked up and left. There was no home surrounded by minds of that sort and the only conceivable solution was to travel in my van in search of a firm setting to catch my breath.

Instead of risking a chance at a DUI drinking at bars, I found an alternative source to numb the pain at local Kava bars in Florida. Kava and kratom are teas (kratom is highly addictive). Both substances extinguish inhibitions, and at these establishments I discovered most people were also running or hiding from their own pain. After a few rounds, it became easy to fall into a heartfelt conversation. A deep reciprocal dialogue would ensue about regret, misfortune, and lessons with some stranger who was readily available to lend an ear.

More times than not, I‚Äôd catch a certain familiar shocked gaze, an open mouth with eyes wide due to trumping their story with my account of thirty-six years of conspiracy, secrecy and betrayal. Knowing I‚Äôd only be in the location for a night or two, and with nothing but time on my side, I found the secure comfort in these cool cavernous bars to hold nothing back. Most strangers found relief from their problems after hearing my story. They all understood why I left, and the support was immense to never go back to that world full of liars.

Those strangers helped my own memory piece together clues I‚Äôd been told for years. Not so much by their questions, which had a constant theme of needing more clarity because the entire story seemed completely irrational. They never actually helped with anything other than allowing my own voice to be heard out loud. All the jumbled pieces came together. Not in that very moment, but later laying in my van alone at night when I was able to filter facts from the fiction.

One prime example of this sifting process was back in my twenties. My mom once stated how much she hated my actual biological father. She posed the story as if he‚Äôd shown up to our house when I was fifteen years old in pursuit of reconnecting with her intimately. That was the exact time my ‚Äúdad‚Äù disappeared and didn‚Äôt return for six years. I realized this was no coincidence. No, it was intentionally manufactured due to my mother‚Äôs secret paternity fraud revealed at that time in my life.

**The Uncle Betrayal**

https://preview.redd.it/dfwlzydt4vmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f8d74a12145c71c9f7ce1aaad7fce67485441c

The main point in exposing a very dark period of my life was not out of some bitter need to blast people‚Äôs mistakes on the internet. It‚Äôs not due to anger or some jaded sense of needing relief or justice. The reason being is to magnify how crucial it is to keep your wounds guarded from those closest and who know you best. The more regularly a person is in your life, the less likely you want them to have an ugly memory of your scars. Best case scenario they keep what they know quiet. But let‚Äôs be real here. People love to gossip, over-analyze, and judge, even with the tiniest details about your life. Don‚Äôt hand them a grenade launcher and guide their aim at your critical vulnerabilities.

Unless you‚Äôre the compulsive sharer-type, could you imagine telling people you see daily or weekly, a story like this? Why would you?

If you‚Äôre one of those people who stand firm on the belief that you have a small circle that you can trust no matter what, remember: at one point, I believed the same. One person in particular I believed in was my uncle. After the fallout with my nuclear family, I went east to visit him. I didn‚Äôt immediately blurt out the secret. He was my uncle and it was obvious to him that my happy-go-lucky nature was a bit off. He nudged and nudged, and I did need someone to talk to.

The idea of paying someone three hundred an hour to sit in a comfy recliner was out of the question. And with nowhere else to turn, he eventually wore my defenses down by repeating an honorably solemn vow, ‚ÄúWhatever you tell me, it stays in the vault.‚Äù He forgot to mention that the vault doors stayed open during operating hours for all employees and customers to take a long gander at the contents inside. The only secrets he kept were his own. Those he buried deep underground on an unmapped island like a pirate‚Äôs treasure.

To be fair, my mom warned, ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt be trusted.‚Äù It was silly to think there was some lead fortress bond between uncle and nephew. Especially when there‚Äôs a juicy story sizzling in the oven with a delicious aroma everyone can smell. I should‚Äôve known the pure contempt he had for my mom would consume him. Once he knew the name of my biological father, an almost elated smirk erected up the right side of his cheek bearing no teeth. He‚Äôd met him numerous times and truthfully, it was kind of funny. Because a simple glance at myself in the mirror exposed just how similar we looked. We had the same nose and eyebrows. The main difference was I had a healthy patch of hair on the top of my head and he was Mr. Clean bald. I still thank God that I got my mom‚Äôs side of the genes for DHT (Dihydrotestosterone).

To be brief, my uncle wasted no time telling my loud mouth cousin, his son, all my business. The joke was on me. I found out by visiting my cousin a few weeks later when traveling down south in my van. We sat in his living room. He had his cell phone on speaker mode on a three-way call with his mom, and a second cousin. They all loved to incessantly bump their gums. My second cousin asked in the sweetest voice, ‚ÄúHow are you? Is everything okay?‚Äù I replied in a stoic manner, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù My eyes darted to my cousin‚Äôs quivering bottom lip. His inability to make eye contact was a dead giveaway. He understood that I had become aware that he knew things he wasn‚Äôt supposed to. Once he hung up the phone, I strategically pressed him in a non-judgmental way. He folded almost immediately into admitting the truth. Once those three were informed, I knew everyone in my entire bloodline had heard the story.

**The Moral**

The moral of the article is either tell no one, or tell strangers, or pay a therapist if you‚Äôve got the money. It‚Äôs sad we live in a world where the ones closest to us present the most danger. Oh well. Suck it up, buttercup, it is what it is. Now don‚Äôt be foolish and let my story fall on deaf ears and take heed to my advice that applies to more than just dysfunctional family secrets. Do you have career failures, relationship that ended badly, or load of shame you‚Äôre carrying? If so, tell a stranger who doesn‚Äôt have time to waste unlike a therapist who‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs interesting, let‚Äôs dive into that further next week,‚Äù as cha-ching sound effects shoot off in their capitalist brains.

Strangers are unpolished and untamed by social restraint, revealing a level of truth that most people will never risk speaking. They won‚Äôt recognize you later or care to speak again. Whoever they tell your story to will probably care even less, and best thing of all is, they don‚Äôt know you anyway!

I saw my PCP today and shes referred me to ortho (appointment next week). she still says carpal but I think it sounds more cubital?? can it be both though? 

she also referred me to get wrist xrays and said ortho will probably need them. if its nerve or muscle though, what good is the xray? should I wait on the xray until after seeing the ortho?

The football team I support recently signed a player from Germany. He was born in 2002 and his name is Merlin R√∂hl. Seemingly all of our fans talking about the transfer are making something of the wizard connection - he's magic, or he's got a wand of a left foot or whatever it would be.

I've never once in my life heard Merlin as a name for a real person. I'm pretty sure I've seen it as a punchline on NNCJ. But I had a look at the stats and:

- it made it into the England and Wales top 1000 in 2001
- it was in the US top 1000 until the 1970s, peaking inside the top 300 in the late 1920s
- even in 2024 it was given to 72 American boys, as many as Elton, Irvin, Leopold, Rigoberto, Saleem and Jordon
- it was also in the French top 500 for most of the 2000s

Even so I can't really imagine ordering a coffee and putting down my name as Merlin. It feels too mystical and mythical for the real world. But then again I see Orion and Oberon and Guinevere here and THOSE don't seem too crazy...

Honestly, the cost-per-smile turned out to be one of the cheapest morale boosts I‚Äôve ever seen.

Why it worked better than expected:

Universal utility: Everyone can use socks. Doesn‚Äôt matter the role, age, or gender‚Äînobody says no to fresh pairs.

Small cost, big reaction: Each pair was barely a couple of bucks, but people acted like they‚Äôd just been given a premium gift bag.

Office culture boost: Instead of another box of donuts or generic coffee run, socks actually stuck. People were showing them off, comparing colors, and laughing about ‚Äúsock day.‚Äù

On the flip side, gifting like this also made me realize why socks are such an underrated flip. They‚Äôre cheap, universally useful, and create repeat demand. When even coworkers are asking where they can grab more, you know the item has legs.

For anyone curious, this is the direct W2C I used:

Saw Matt Clark's first big league homer in 2014 live. He vanished after that September cup of coffee

Was present for (watched on the TV in line for concessions) Seth Mejias-Brean's first big league homer in 2019. He had enormous hands and my girlfriend thought he looked like Waluigi

Sean Lowe pitched 8 innings of 1 run ball at my first ever MLB game. Jose Canseco hit 2 homers that day too

David Manning started for the Brewers the first time I ever went to Miller Park (my favorite team and park) in 2003. He got shelled and he never made it back to the bigs

See explanation for Choo Freeman as it is the same for Tike Redman

### 1. Parse the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Real MVP?

Let‚Äôs start with the numbers. The **Samsung Lions** are the overwhelming favorites here, priced at **-360 to -300** across bookmakers (implied probability: **75‚Äì78%**). Kiwoom Heroes, meanwhile, are **+300 to +310** (25‚Äì29% implied). That‚Äôs like betting on a toaster to beat a chef in a cooking contest‚Äîpossible, but not advisable unless you‚Äôre a fan of burnt baguettes.

The spread is **Samsung -1.5 (-150 to -170)** and Kiwoom +1.5 (+200 to +217). The total runs line sits at **9.5‚Äì10.5**, with the **Under** getting better odds (1.8‚Äì1.95 vs. 1.8‚Äì2.2 for the Over). Samsung‚Äôs dominance in the moneyline and spread suggests they‚Äôre the team to back, but let‚Äôs dig deeper.

### 2. Digest the News: Pitchers, Power, and Pasta

The KBO hasn‚Äôt spilled much tea about this matchup, but the **Samsung Lions** have been a well-oiled machine this season. Their 1.36‚Äì1.4 moneyline pricing implies they‚Äôre the league‚Äôs version of a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù (though nothing in sports is ever *that* sure, unless it‚Äôs a forfeit). Kiwoom, on the other hand, is the team that forgot to bring their coffee before the game‚Äî0‚Äì2 against Samsung this season with a 3.47 ERA in those matchups.

Meanwhile, the **Under** on the total is quietly tantalizing. Samsung‚Äôs pitching staff has a 4.45 ERA, but their defense has been a fortress, allowing just 4.2 runs per game. Kiwoom‚Äôs offense? A leaky faucet. They‚Äôre hitting .243 as a team, which is about as exciting as watching a spreadsheet update itself. If this game stays under 10 runs, it‚Äôll be because both

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can‚Äôt Hit a Curveball*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Hanwha Eagles (-1.5, 1.51 implied odds) are the clear favorites here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **62-67%** across bookmakers. That‚Äôs the statistical equivalent of a vending machine: reliable, if a little overpriced. The NC Dinos (2.55-2.64 implied odds) are the underdogs, but don‚Äôt count them out just yet.

**Totals are the real star of the show**: The Over/Under sits at **8.0-8.5 runs**, with the Over priced at **1.83-1.87** (implied \~53-54% probability). But here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîNC‚Äôs second baseman **Kim Joo-won** is a one-man fireworks show. He‚Äôs hit **13 HRs**, swiped **38 bases**, and has an OPS of **.850** (think of it as a baseball version of a superhero‚Äôs power level). If Kim‚Äôs bat stays hot, this game could explode like a pi√±ata at a toddler‚Äôs birthday party.

**Spread breakdown**: Hanwha‚Äôs -1.5 line suggests they‚Äôre expected to win by a run and a half. That‚Äôs the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúWe think Hanwha‚Äôs pitching staff is less leaky than a sieve, but don‚Äôt get too comfortable.‚Äù

---

### 2. Digest the News: Kim‚Äôs Natural Power, Hanwha‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeh‚Äù Momentum

NC‚Äôs Kim Joo-won is the KBO‚Äôs answer to a walking, talking, home-run-hitting espresso shot. In his last game, he hit a solo HR and a two-run double, then shrugged and said, *‚ÄúJust natural stuff, man.‚Äù* His focus on ‚Äúnatural power hitting‚Äù is less a strategy and more a declaration of war on opposing pitchers. If he‚Äôs anything like a coffee addict on a Monday morning, expect him to dominate.

Meanwhile, the Hanwha Eagles are the KBO‚Äôs version of a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù response. They‚Äôre favored, sure, but their recent performance is as vague as a text from an ex. They‚Äôre not blowing anyone away, but they‚Äôre also not getting blown out. Think of them

I've never posted anything to Reddit so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.

I'm a barista at a coffee chain. The environment at work is pretty relaxed and we all get along well. I've worked with this person, who we'll call S, for a few years.

S is a hard worker and generally pleasant to be around except for the burps. For as long as I've known him he has had not great manners regarding bodily functions. S lets these burps rip unabashedly, doesn't even try to muffle them with his hand or anything. Stops mid-sentence to belch with abandon. He will also release them over the work headset, directly into the ears of his fellow workers! We're talking high fidelity. And these are not normal, chill burps. This man burps like there's something malevolent inside of him trying to escape through his esophagus. These burps are so loud and happen so frequently that honestly it might be a medical concern. I physically recoil from them. I'm not even exaggerating.

I know S can't control them. I think I'd be able to deal if he at least attempted to hide them, but when I say that he absolutely does not give a fuck about the rudeness, *he does not give a fuck*. He knows they bother me because I have told him so. ""Hey, S, can you not burp into the mic?"" ""S, could you cover your mouth?"" It literally takes everything in me to remain professional and patient when I address him about it. It's like a silly joke for him I think? When he does say excuse me, he says it like a mischievous little burp imp, like I'm the crazy one for being so bothered.

Am I the crazy one? This post is so long. There isn't even a real solution to this because it's not like S can just stop burping. But it's rude, right?

Before giving it to me he opened it up and cleaned it thoroughly. It worked perfectly fine, but recently it started giving me smaller coffees somehow?

Shortly after it started happening the machine asked me to do a descaling. I figured it was the cause of the smaller coffees, but I did it with the tablets I got from the machine (not jura tablets) and it didn't fix the issue. On top of that, the steam valve seems partially clogged or something now? When I activate it it will take around 10 seconds before it starts shooting steam. Water is still instant though. Also this may be just the milk  frother being dirty but it started blasting milk everywhere when I use it... So my 14 seconds time I set for a cappuccino doesn't give me the correct amount at all.

The ingredients of the descaler: citric acid, sodium bisulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, polyethylene glycol.

What could be the issue? It feels like the machine is partially clogged somehow but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Should I be getting jura branded descaling tablets?

I‚Äôm a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she‚Äôd probably give me a decent Yelp review.

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole ‚Äúpersonal growth‚Äù thing. No baggage, no ‚Äúcrazy ex‚Äù stories‚Äîjust came out the other side in a solid spot.

I‚Äôm looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that‚Äôs fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I‚Äôm easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I‚Äôve traveled a lot (military brat perks)‚Äîfive continents and counting. Would love someone who‚Äôs adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I‚Äôm an extroverted introvert‚Äîsocial, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I‚Äôve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I‚Äôm not in a rush, but I‚Äôd love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn‚Äôt my jam‚Äîso Texas ladies, you‚Äôve got home-field advantage.

I‚Äôm a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I‚Äôm a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that‚Äôs work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I‚Äôm equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn‚Äôt easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
You are damn smart ‚Äì but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.

Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That‚Äôs the kind of bond I‚Äôm looking for‚Äîone that‚Äôs deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

Tip 2: If you received bad news that day, don't take the test if it's possible. Explain your situation and let yourself get over it because it will be stucked in your mind during testing I promise.

Tip 3: Make fun flashcards. I like using black, blue and red pens. I make tons of drawings and relate words to sounds, animals, other languages, or just things in general that will help me remember.

Tip 4: REST, don't be on your phone that night and don't pull an ""All nighter"" it won't help and you'll kill your brain cells

Tip 5: You know that topic that you swear it won't be on the test? It will and you'll regret not studying it enough.

I knew it then and I damn well know it now, but hindsight‚Äôs a bitch. I keep telling myself that if I had just ignored the banging on my door, if I had just stayed my ass in bed‚Ä¶well, maybe none of this would be happening to me.

But guess what I did?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------¬†

It was around 3am, a few nights ago, and I was lying in bed doom scrolling as usual. You know, typical night owl behavior. I live alone in a one-bedroom near Dallas: nothing to write home about, but it‚Äôs been home for about 3 years now, peeling paint, busted blinds and all.

I had just decided to put my phone down and try to get some sleep (for probably the 10^(th) time) when the banging started. Not knocking, mind you, but *banging*. Desperate, frantic, as if someone were throwing their whole-body weight against the door.

The first thought that crossed my mind was ‚Äú*oh shit, someone‚Äôs being chased!‚Äù*

The second was *‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù*

But that sound‚Ä¶that banging? You can‚Äôt really fake that type of frenzy.

So against the better voices in my head, I got out of bed, walked out into the living room and opened the door.

Standing outside on my ‚Äúunless you have pizza, go away‚Äù door mat was a guy probably around my age: mid-twenties, maybe. He was pale, gaunt (in the sense that he could use a pizza himself‚Ä¶) and his eyes were bloodshot as if he hadn‚Äôt slept in days.

The clothes he was wearing looked‚Ä¶odd, to be PC about it. He was wearing torn boots laced with wire, a jacket patched by hand, stitched together with varied pieces fabric that didn‚Äôt go together at all, and on the sleeve was an insignia which looked military in nature, half-burned away as if someone tried to erase it and only partially succeeded.

He startled and stared at me as if *I* were the one causing a ruckus in the middle of the night on a Thursday.

‚ÄúThey said I‚Äôd land in *before*,‚Äù he rasped, his voice sounding cracked and in need of hydration. ‚ÄúIs this before?‚Äù

‚ÄúErm‚Ä¶‚Äù I laughed nervously, peering outside to see if someone were filming this as some sort of weird tiktok trend. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, before what? Do you know what time it is?‚Äù

Without warning, he pushed past me, barreling into my apartment, and I immediately went into *oh shit* mode.

‚ÄúHey, whoa my guy! You can‚Äôt just come in here. Who the hell are you?‚Äù

As he was scraping past me, I caught a whiff of him and boy did he smell. Like a mixture of smoke and iron‚Ä¶but not any sort of iron I‚Äôd ever smelled before. It was a chemical-y smell, acrid, like burnt circuitry mixed with wet earth and something coppery‚Ä¶blood, maybe?

He peered around my living room like an awestruck tourist, his body shaking, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it were from fear or some weird kindof excitement. He went around the room, touching my lamp, my phone charger, even a pile of assorted junk mail sitting on the coffee table.

He stopped and looked at me, a grin slowly spreading across his manic face. ‚ÄúStill work,‚Äù he whispered, more to himself than to me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still electricity, still light.‚Äù

I cleared my throat and repeated myself, asking who he was and if he were in some sort of trouble or danger.

He froze, his eyes filling with tears, and then he smiled. A broken, horrible smile.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have them yet. They haven‚Äôt come.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt we have?‚Äù I asked, starting to get annoyed.

He was bouncing with what I assumed was happiness at this point. ‚ÄúThe Flags.‚Äù

He stopped, his voice dropping into something barely audible.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know them when they come‚Ä¶same flag on every house, in every classroom, waving in every patch of sky they can reach. They watch you through it, your every single move. The flags aren‚Äôt fabric ‚Äì it‚Äôs an *eye*, somehow‚Ä¶you look at it once and you can feel them looking back, watching.‚Äù

My stomach twisted, and my annoyance grew.

But he continued, seemingly impervious to the look of irritation I knew was written on my face. ‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶they take the children first. One morning, buses came and picked them up, but never brought them home. Feeds on all security cameras went dark. They said the kids were being *re-educated*. That word means something terrifying there.‚Äù

Then he grabbed my wrist, his grip ice-cold against the warmth of my own skin. He held my wrist so tightly that I couldn‚Äôt pull away.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let them tell you that safety is worth obedience,‚Äù he whispered, his voice dropping even lower. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it all starts. Curfews, registries‚Ä¶neighbors disappearing until people simply stop asking questions. And then‚Äî‚Äù

He stopped, mid-sentence, a look of renewed horror etching itself upon his face. His whole body began to shudder and shake violently, to the point I thought maybe he was OD‚Äôing or having a seizure or something. His mouth remained open, but no words came out.

At that moment, the lights in my apartment begin to flicker and buzz but not like some normal power surge. The bulbs dimmed *red*, twice, like some sorta fucked up electrical heartbeat.

He panicked, and blood began to pour from his nose and down his face, dripping onto his clothes and then onto my carpet.

‚Äúhey! Oh my god, are you okay?! I‚Äôm going to call 911‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù

He gripped my wrist even tighter, trying to pull me closer to him. My flight-or-flight instincts began to kick in, and my body was wanting to choose fight. I balled my fists, preparing to defend myself if need be, though I‚Äôm no fighter by any means and was more or less counting on him being weak due to his size.

‚ÄúLet me go, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh god, no!‚Äù He was ignoring me now, due to¬† the skin blistering around his mouth as if he‚Äôd touched something corrosive to his lips. He began clawing in his jacket, fumbling around for something when he suddenly pulled out a small black cube, about the size of a car key fob. Coming from the cube was a humming noise, as if it held a trapped insect of some kind.

He shoved into my hands roughly, his skin literally cracking and burning where it held the cube, but he didn‚Äôt let it go until I took hold of it.

‚ÄúIf it hums again, *don‚Äôt answer it*, no matter what!‚Äù he commanded, his voice all of a sudden resolute. ‚ÄúCuriosity may get the better of you, and you may think it‚Äôs me. But it‚Äôs not me. They wear us like clothes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fu‚Äî‚Äù

Without waiting to answer any sort of questions or to elaborate (as if anything he‚Äôd said up to this point made a lick of sense), he turned to my front door, closed it, turned and looked at me, blinked twice, then opened the door again and stepped through it.

Only‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt step outside.

Instead, I swear to all that‚Äôs holy, I saw space *bend* around the frame of my front door and beyond, as if the air were water and he was slipping beneath the surface. And the sound was like the tearing of fabric. But then he was gone.

I stood there, dumbstruck, sure that maybe I was the one¬†on drugs (though I definitely was not) and this was just a really strange trip.

A solid five minutes passed before I caught myself and slowly walked over to the door and poked my head through it, looking uneasily around the empty corridor.

He was definitely gone.

For a brief moment I thought maybe I‚Äôd just had some sort of waking dream and that everything that just happened were a figment of my imagination. But I looked down at my hand and I was still clasping that little black cube, which had fallen silent.

Just for shits and giggles, I looked outside one more time and then slammed the door shut and locked every lock on it, and then sunk to the floor, my back resting against it.

‚ÄúWhat the actual *fuck* just happened?‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn‚Äôt get any sleep that night. The smell of the guy lingered in my apartment until well past dawn. No amount of febreezing helped.

I put the cube on my coffee table and left it there. It‚Äôs actually pretty heavy, unnaturally so, for its size, and the edges are sharp‚Ä¶sharp enough to cut you if you hold it the wrong way. It hasn‚Äôt made a single sound since the man forced it onto me and then vanished. But as I‚Äôve sat and watched it, sometimes I think I hear a faint scratching sound, like fingernails on glass.

I don‚Äôt know what to do with it. Google‚Äôs been unhelpful in identifying it and chatgpt says I should either destroy it or take it to the cops. I thought about hiding it away and just forgetting about it, but I don‚Äôt know.

Part of me is intrigued by it.

And then part of me wants to believe that it was just the ramblings of some random, insane dude who, for whatever reason, happened to stumble into my apartment building (which is code-locked now that I remember‚Ä¶). Maybe he *was* on drugs of some kind or maybe he was in the grips of some sort of manic paranoia.

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking of the way the world looked when he just disappeared. And his words still ring in my ears, leaving tinges of fear and uncertainty:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know them when they come.‚Äù

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This all happened a few nights ago...and for the first couple of days, the cube was just that: a cube. Silent, still, just a weird thing taking up space on my table. 

Then, late last night...it hummed. I heard it from my bedroom. It was just once, but it was enough. The sound was low, like a bass note I could literally feel in my teeth. 

I slowly walked into the living room, wielding a plastic cosplay sword (you know, to do some damage if need be) but the living room was still. 

I looked at the cube from a distance, but didn't touch it. I somehow felt that would result in my ""answering it,"" which the dude explicitly instructed me *not to do*. 

But as I was looking at it, I think for a split second I saw something shift across its surface. Not a reflection but almost as if...something inside were pushing outward. 

Oh and that scratching sound I was hearing? Yea, it's gotten louder now. I can't tune it out no matter what I do. 

I don't know what the fuck is going to happen when/if it hums again, and I'm almost sure that I definitely do not want to know...",2,1756866483.0,nosleep,2,0.63,False

Not from stress. Not from boredom. But from something *else*. Something dry and crawling that licks at the edge of your sanity like windblown sand against old bone.

Yeah, I used to wonder that too.

Now I don't wonder much of anything. My thoughts come slow, like they‚Äôve got to drag themselves up through molasses. I don‚Äôt sleep‚Äînot really. When I do, I hear the whispering. I see flickers in corners that should be empty. I don‚Äôt trust my reflection anymore. I don‚Äôt trust my own **voice**. Something came back with me from that place. Something I never invited.

The job was simple‚Äîor so I thought. One night shift in the middle of nowhere. And a list of rules. Just twelve of them. Keep your head down. Stay awake. Follow the rules. But rules mean nothing when the air itself wants to gut you. When silence starts to hum. When shadows **breathe**.

Let me take you back to the beginning.

My name‚Äôs Eric. I‚Äôm 28 years old, though now I feel older‚Äîworn down like desert stone under centuries of wind. I‚Äôve never been the stay-in-one-place kind of guy. I‚Äôve chased hurricanes on oil rigs, run toward wildfires when everyone else ran away, and even launched myself off rooftops for a few thousand YouTube subscribers back in the day. I guess you could say danger was my drug. I didn‚Äôt just flirt with risk‚ÄîI waltzed with it, arms wide, laughing in its face.

So when I saw the job post‚Äîa night watch gig at an isolated weather station in the far reaches of West Texas‚Äîit felt like a gift. The pay was suspiciously good. The location? Dead center of the Chihuahuan Desert, fifty miles off any real road. No towns. No neighbors. No signal. Just a pin on a map and a time to show up.

I packed light: books I wouldn‚Äôt read, a journal I wouldn‚Äôt write in, and that stupid optimism only people who haven‚Äôt been broken yet still carry.

The outpost‚ÄîStation 119B‚Äîwas a concrete box. One room. No markings, no signs of life. Just a dented steel door and a big black window staring out at an endless stretch of sand. Inside, there was a desk cluttered with equipment I couldn‚Äôt name, a fridge, a cot, and a generator that sounded like it was one bad night away from dying. But what caught my attention wasn‚Äôt any of that.

It was the manual.

A thin, grease-stained pamphlet on the desk, labeled in crooked red ink:

**RULES FOR NIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR ‚Äì STATION 119B**

Not instructions. Not training. *Rules*.

There were twelve.

And they weren‚Äôt the kind of rules you find in HR handbooks. They read like folklore passed down from some ancient desert cult.

1. **Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.**  
2. **If you hear tapping on the window, turn off all lights and lie face down until it stops.**  
3. **Log wind speed every 30 minutes. If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.**  
4. **If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.**  
5. **Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.**  
6. **If the desert goes silent (no wind, no bugs), recite the phrase taped to the fridge.**  
7. **Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base Code: Yellow Echo.**  
8. **If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.**  
9. **Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.**  
10. **Don‚Äôt fall asleep.**  
11. **Don‚Äôt eat the food in the fridge after midnight.**  
12. **If Rule 1 is broken, burn the manual immediately and pray.**  

I read them again. And again. Each pass made my skin prickle. It was like reading a curse disguised as policy. But instead of walking away, **I laughed. Really laughed‚Äîsharp, barked out loud like a man who thinks he‚Äôs above fear**‚Äîbecause I was still the guy who thought ghosts were fun stories and rules were made to be tested.

It sounded strange in that room‚Äîtoo loud, too human. It bounced off the concrete walls like it didn‚Äôt belong there. Maybe it didn‚Äôt.

In my head, this was all just some elaborate hazing ritual. A creepy prank left behind by some disgruntled ex-employee with a flair for drama. I imagined a guy like me‚Äîbored, probably high‚Äîscribbling down those rules just to mess with the next poor sucker assigned to Station 119B. The candle, the weird times, the chanting. Classic psychological tripwire stuff. Probably some government joke I wasn‚Äôt in on.

Still‚Ä¶ the place didn‚Äôt sit right with me.

The air was too dry. Not just desert-dry, but hollow, like the atmosphere had been *scooped out*. The silence felt rehearsed. Choreographed. And the stars above the station‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt twinkle. They just *watched*. Cold, close, too sharp. Like pinholes poked through a thin sheet of sky. If you stared too long, you got the feeling something might stare back.

But I told myself, *I‚Äôve jumped out of planes. I‚Äôve stood on collapsing fire lines. I‚Äôve put my own damn hand in a box full of scorpions on a dare for likes*. What‚Äôs a little ghost story in the desert?

The first couple hours passed like I expected: dull, dry, and quiet. I logged the wind speed like Rule #3 said, every thirty minutes. I even timed it with my watch to be precise‚Äîtreating it more like a chore than a warning. I made some instant coffee that tasted like regret. I watched a tarantula the size of my palm crawl across the outside of the window‚Äîslow, aimless, like it knew it was being watched.

Then, around midnight, things started to‚Ä¶ bend. Not snap. Not break. Just *bend*, subtly, like the world had gone a few degrees off center.

It was **12:11 AM** when I heard the knock.

A sound so *ordinary* it felt impossible for it to feel *so wrong*.

Not banging. Not frantic. Just three knocks‚Äîspaced out. *Intentional*. Like whoever was outside wasn‚Äôt asking to be let in. They were stating they were already here.

Every hair on my neck stood at attention. My hands clenched around the mug before I realized they were shaking.

My mind stumbled back to Rule #1: *Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.*

I froze. My thoughts tried to be logical, tried to be brave. *Probably just the wind,* I whispered to myself, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.

But the wind doesn‚Äôt knock. It howls. It hisses. It dances through cracks and moans through empty places. It doesn‚Äôt walk up to a reinforced steel door and knock *three times, exactly*, then stop.

I checked the wall clock.

**12:13 AM.**

My throat tightened like I‚Äôd swallowed dry sand. My legs screamed to move‚Äîtoward the door, away from it, I didn‚Äôt even know. But I stayed still. Not because I believed the rule. No, not yet. But because something in my gut, something primal and old, told me that opening that door would be a very *final* kind of mistake.

The knocks came again. Same rhythm. Three. Then silence.

**12:20.** More knocks.

**12:29.** Again.

**12:41.** They kept coming‚Äîevery few minutes. Always three. Always the same weight behind them. As if the thing on the other side had all the time in the world.

I didn‚Äôt respond. I didn‚Äôt speak. I just sat there, heart hammering, watching the second hand crawl across the clock face like it was moving through tar.

Then came the tapping.

*Not on the door.*

On the *window*.

A soft, delicate *tap-tap-tap*, like fingernails on glass.

I turned slowly‚Äîdeliberately‚Äîexpecting to see something. *Anything*. A face. A shape. But the window showed only the dark, stretching desert. Pale sand under a black sky. Empty. Still.

Then: *tap-tap-tap.*

Right against the glass. Closer this time. More urgent. Like whatever was outside had grown impatient.

Something deep in me‚Äîsome instinct older than thought‚Äîscreamed to obey the manual.

I threw the lights off and dropped flat to the floor, face down, just like Rule #2 demanded.

And let me tell you‚ÄîI felt *ridiculous*. Lying on cold concrete like a scolded child playing hide and seek. My breath echoed in my ears, too loud, too fast. The tapping continued‚Äîsoft, steady, like it was trying to coax me up.

I didn‚Äôt move.

The darkness stretched forever.

Finally‚Äîmercifully‚Äîthe tapping stopped.

I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, slowly, I pushed myself up, muscles aching from the tension. I flicked the lights back on and blinked into the sterile brightness.

Then, like a complete jackass, I laughed at myself.

*Real mature,* I thought. *Terrified by shadows and knocks like I‚Äôm in a Halloween special.*

But the laughter didn‚Äôt stick this time. It crumbled in my throat like dry paper.

Because as I stood there, letting my pulse settle, my eyes drifted toward the wind monitor on the desk.

And it was flatlining.

**Zero.**

No wind. Not even a whisper.

My stomach dropped.

Rule #3 roared back into my mind like a siren:

*If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.*

And suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt laughing anymore.

I checked the wind monitor again, hoping‚Äî*praying*‚ÄîI‚Äôd read it wrong.

**Wind Speed: 0 mph.**

Nothing. Not a breeze. Not a whisper. The line on the graph was dead flat, like a heartbeat that had given up.

My chest tightened‚Äîsqueezed from the inside like my lungs were folding in. That couldn‚Äôt be right. Out here, the wind never stopped completely. Even the still nights carried a faint, restless stir through the sand. But now? The world outside was holding its breath.

I should‚Äôve stayed inside.

But something pulled me toward the door. Not curiosity‚Äî*denial*. That desperate human instinct to confirm the lie, to tell yourself everything‚Äôs fine if you can just *see* it for yourself.

I stepped outside.

And immediately felt the weight of a mistake settle on me like lead.

The air was‚Ä¶ *wrong*. Not just calm‚Äî*dead*. Still in a way that felt manufactured, unnatural. Even my own breathing sounded too loud. There was no wind. No rustle of dry shrubs. No skittering bugs. Nothing but the crunch of my boots on sand.

The desert had gone mute.

And then I saw them.

Footprints.

In the sand, just a few feet from the threshold.

Coming *in*.

But none going out.

I stood there for a full, frozen second, my body refusing to catch up to what my brain was screaming. Then instinct kicked in‚ÄîI spun, bolted for the door, slammed it shut behind me like it might keep something out that had already gotten in.

Lock. Chain. Bolt. I checked everything. Hands trembling. Breath sharp and uneven.

And then my stomach twisted as another rule clawed its way up from memory:

**Rule #7: Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base. Code: Yellow Echo.**

The satellite phone was right where it had been‚Äîon the desk, a grey relic from another era. I grabbed it like a lifeline, dialed the code with fingers that barely obeyed me.

It rang.

Once.

Twice.

Then it connected.

And what I heard next nearly stopped my heart.

It was *my voice*. But not like a recording. It was *live*. It was *me*. Except it wasn‚Äôt. The cadence was slightly wrong. The tone a hair off. Too calm. Too final.

""You shouldn‚Äôt have opened the door,"" it said.

*Click.*

Silence.

I stood there, staring at the receiver like it might explain itself. Then I yanked the cord from the back. The phone went dead.

That‚Äôs when the lights cut out.

All at once.

Like someone had flipped a master switch on reality.

Total blackness swallowed the room. The kind of black that has *depth*. Like it could reach out and touch you back.

I didn‚Äôt breathe. Didn‚Äôt move.

Then my memory jolted into motion‚Äî*Rule #4: If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.*

I scrambled to the shelf, nearly knocking over the chair in the dark. My fingers found the candle‚Äîa thick, stubby thing already set in a glass holder. I fumbled for the lighter, struck it, and lit the wick with a hand that couldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

A small, flickering flame sprang to life.

And the room changed.

The dim red light didn‚Äôt just reveal the space‚Äîit *warped* it. Shadows twisted too far into the corners, stretching longer than they should. The air shimmered, barely perceptible, like heat off asphalt‚Äîbut colder. The walls felt too close now, as if the room had been inching inward, shrinking around me when I wasn‚Äôt looking.

I turned slowly, and for just a breath, I thought I saw movement in the reflection of the window. Not a shape. Not a face. Just *shifting*. The kind of thing your brain registers an instant too late.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A whisper.

Soft. Barely audible. But unmistakable.

""Eric.""

My name.

It wasn‚Äôt shouted. It wasn‚Äôt angry. It was‚Ä¶ *gentle*. Almost caring. Like the voice of someone who knew me. Loved me. Wanted me to trust it.

But it didn‚Äôt come from the door.

And it didn‚Äôt come from outside.

It came from *somewhere*. From *everywhere*. Inside the room. Behind the walls. In the space under the cot. In the reflection in the window I wasn‚Äôt supposed to look at. My skin crawled. My mouth went dry. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to run for the door by itself.

**Rule #5: Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.**

But was it outside?

I didn‚Äôt know.

And that‚Äôs what terrified me most.

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself not to move. Not to speak.

The voice came again.

""Eric,"" it whispered. Closer this time. Like it had crossed a threshold.

*Like it was already inside.*

I clutched the manual like a child clings to a teddy bear in the dark, desperate for comfort that paper couldn‚Äôt possibly give. My arms wrapped around it as if the ink inside could somehow shield me from whatever *else* was breathing in that room with me.

Then I heard it.

The fridge.

Buzzing.

Low, mechanical. A sound so ordinary it shouldn't have chilled my blood. But in that moment, it was like hearing a coffin creak open by itself. My eyes snapped open. The red candle flickered wildly, the flame stuttering as if suffocating in air that was too still, too heavy.

Then came the silence.

Not quiet‚Äî*silence*. The kind that doesn‚Äôt just fill the room but *consumes* it.

No wind. No bugs. No low hum from the machines that had kept me grounded in reality for the past few hours. Even the candle‚Äôs flicker made no sound.

Just an aching, crushing stillness.

Rule #6. My breath hitched.

I bolted toward the fridge, legs trembling like they didn‚Äôt belong to me. My fingers scrambled along the metal door until they found it: a small, weathered strip of paper taped just above the handle.

The writing was faint, as though the ink had tried to escape the words it formed.

**‚ÄúO watcher of dusk, I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.‚Äù**

My lips moved before I could think.

‚ÄúO watcher of dusk‚Ä¶‚Äù I began, my voice cracking like an old record. ‚ÄúI stand still in your silence. Pass me by.‚Äù

It felt like trying to speak underwater. My tongue stumbled over the rhythm the first few times, the words sticking to my throat like glue.

I repeated the phrase. Again. And again. Louder.

And then‚ÄîI *heard* it.

The silence shattered.

A sudden gust slammed against the walls of the outpost, making the concrete groan in protest. Wind howled through unseen cracks. Insects returned in a chorus of buzzing, scratching life. The room *breathed* again.

And I‚ÄîGod help me‚ÄîI nearly cried.

But the relief lasted all of three seconds.

Then the phone rang.

That shouldn‚Äôt have been possible.

I had *unplugged* it. Pulled the cord straight out of the back. I stared at the empty socket, then at the receiver.

It rang again.

And again.

**Three times total.**

Rule #8 screamed through my skull: *If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.*

I already had.

I backed away, the manual still clutched in one hand, candle in the other. My eyes flicked to the wall clock.

**2:51 AM.**

And just like that, another rule surfaced.

Rule #9: *Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.*

I hadn‚Äôt meant to. I swear I hadn‚Äôt.

But the moment I thought it, I *looked*.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

Not in the window itself, but in the *reflection*. In the far corner of the room, behind me‚Äîa tall, human-shaped figure. Perfectly still. Head cocked slightly to one side like it was trying to *understand* me.

My breath caught in my throat like a wire pulled tight.

I turned.

Nothing there.

I whipped back to the window‚Äîand it was still there. Same spot. Same tilt of the head.

Watching.

Unmoving.

I lit another red candle. Then another. My hands moved on instinct now‚Äîdesperation drowning thought. The room bathed in flickering crimson light. Shadows danced madly along the walls.

The figure remained. Still. Patient.

Then‚ÄîI blinked.

And it was gone.

Just gone.

No sound. No movement. Like it had never been there.

But I *knew* it had.

My instincts screamed: *Get out. Get in the truck. Drive until the sky changes.*

But the manual‚Ä¶ it said nothing about leaving. Not once.

And suddenly that absence felt deliberate.

Like the rules had never been written for *leaving*.

Only for *surviving until morning*.

And morning felt very, very far away.

Then it hit me‚Äî*Rule #11*.

**Don‚Äôt eat the food in the fridge after midnight.**

Simple. Strange. I'd read it like a joke the first time. But now, it loomed in my mind like a warning carved into the walls of a tomb. Something churned in my gut‚Äîhunger, maybe. Or dread wearing hunger‚Äôs mask.

I moved toward the fridge.

Every part of me screamed *don‚Äôt*, but my hand gripped the handle anyway. It was cold. Damp with condensation.

I opened it.

And found‚Ä¶ nothing.

Not empty shelves. Not expired leftovers.

*Nothing.*

Every item that had been there earlier‚Äîgone. Erased. As if they'd never existed.

Except for one thing.

A single, folded note resting where the milk used to be.

I unfolded it slowly, heart pounding like a drumbeat in a funeral march.

**‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at the window again.‚Äù**

That was it. No explanation. No name. Just that one line, like the fridge itself was whispering.

My hand trembled as I slammed the door shut.

Then‚Äî*knock knock knock*.

Again.

Same rhythm. Same weight.

The sound drilled into me, stripped away whatever calm I had left. My whole body tensed, but this time, instinct didn‚Äôt scream. This time, I didn‚Äôt freeze.

I glanced at the clock.

**1:35 AM.**

I blinked.

*Wait.*

That was past the time window. Rule #1 ended at 1:34 AM.

Technically‚Ä¶ I could open the door.

And I did.

Cautiously. Slowly. Holding my breath like it might make a difference.

I opened the door.

And saw nothing.

Just the empty desert, black sky overhead, wind rustling sand like whispers too quiet to understand.

But then‚ÄîI looked down.

And that‚Äôs when my stomach dropped.

A second manual lay on the ground.

Different cover. Thicker.

Stamped in large, blood-red lettering:

**‚ÄúRules for Eric ‚Äì Night Two.‚Äù**

Night *two*.

There wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a night two.

I wasn‚Äôt coming back. No one was.

That‚Äôs when I realized the truth.

This place‚ÄîStation 119B‚Äîwasn‚Äôt a weather station. It never had been. It was a *test*. A ritual. A trap.

And I wasn‚Äôt an employee.

I was a subject. A sacrifice. A participant in something I didn‚Äôt understand and could never escape.

Maybe I hadn‚Äôt broken Rule #1. Not technically.

But I didn‚Äôt care about technicalities anymore.

I was done playing by *their* rules.

I walked back inside, teeth clenched, and dropped the new manual into the candle flame.

**Just like Rule #12 said: If Rule #1 is broken, burn the manual immediately‚Ä¶ and pray.**

The paper caught instantly. The flame *devoured* it. Pages curled and blackened, the fire dancing like it had a mind of its own.

Like it was *laughing*.

I backed away.

That‚Äôs when the room changed.

Instantly.

No warning. No flicker. Just *gone*.

The cot‚Äîgone. The fridge‚Äîgone. The desk, the equipment, the satellite phone‚Äîall erased.

The room had reset.

Same size. Same shape. Same walls.

But stripped bare.

Just me.

The window.

And the candle.

My breath came in shallow gulps.

Then came the tapping.

But this time‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt on the glass.

It was *inside* the walls.

Light, skittering taps at first. Then heavier. Then moving.

Circling me.

Like something was crawling through the concrete. Tracing a spiral I couldn‚Äôt see. Trapping me in the center.

My mouth opened, but no sound came out.

And then‚ÄîI remember screaming.

I don‚Äôt remember *why*, exactly.

Only that my voice tore from my throat like it was trying to escape without me. I remember scratching at the door. Fingernails splitting against steel. I remember the candle going out.

And I remember the shadows.

They *crawled* under my skin.

Not metaphorically. I could *feel* them. Like black centipedes burrowing through my veins. Eating their way into my thoughts.

Then‚Äî

Nothing.

I woke up at dawn.

Face down in the dirt, fifty yards from the station. My clothes damp with dew. My hands shaking.

My car keys clenched tight in one fist.

The manual‚Äîgone.

I stumbled back to the building.

The door hung open. No lock. No chain.

Inside?

Empty.

No furniture. No gear. No candles.

Only one thing remained.

A mirror.

Taped to the center of the window.

I walked up to it.

I should‚Äôve turned away.

I should‚Äôve remembered Rule #9.

But I looked.

And what looked back wasn‚Äôt me.

It wore my face‚Äîbut not my *eyes*.

The eyes were wide. Too wide. Stretched like the skin around them had been peeled back.

They were black, bottomless. Not hollow, but *full*‚Äîof things I couldn‚Äôt describe. Things that watched from the other side of glass. Things that waited.

Things that *remembered*.

Now?

I don‚Äôt take jobs anymore. I don‚Äôt go outside after dark. I stay indoors. I keep the lights on. I pretend the rules still protect me.

But nights are hard.

Sometimes I hear knocking.

**Always three times.**

And if the wind ever dies completely‚Ä¶

I stop breathing.

Just in case it's still out there.

Waiting for me to forget the rules.

Even just once.",3,1756866460.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

1n72vjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1n72vjf/extreme_sensitivity_to_everything_post_trauma/,Extreme sensitivity to everything post trauma?,"Ive been dealing with specific post traumatic symptoms that are truly ruling my life. Long story short, i went through an emotional trauma that reopened my childhood trauma that was never processed. It threw me into total shock/depersonalization/dysregulation. I thought i was going to split in half from the shock. I was shaking nonstop for months. I landed in the er because it legit felt like my brain exploding. I felt a complete void in my stomach and the only way i couldve comforted myself was through food. I would throw up every morning. Go into panic constantly. This went on for a few months. I would go from a sympathetic state of panic to a dorsal vagal state often. I went on lexapro and it helped alot. Therapy helped alot too. 3 years later i am working with a somatic/IFS therapist and its been wonderful. 

However, the lasting effects of trauma are still present to a lesser degree. I experience everything so intensely. Emotional processing has gotten better, but when i come down from them my body shakes. Ive developed this insane sensitivity to so many stimulants. Cannot have many things i used to be able to - coffee, b vitamins, ashwaghanda, matcha, high dose vitamins. Its made me fear avoidant with ingesting everything. Its no way to live. Part of me worries my brain chemistry has been so altered that theres no going back and im forever broken. I also feel like something blocks me from letting joy in. I have to think realllyyyy hard and sit in it to allow it to run through me. My brain just works differently now.. i procrastinate more, i push things off my schedule, i get overwhelmed more easily. Its hard to manage. 

Note: I am in therapy for 12 years now. Active yogi, and other somatic practices. Before anyone says anything.. i am doing all the things. It is however, challenging to still navigate when these biological symptoms are present. Has anyone experienced such sensitivity after trauma? How did u cope? ",2,1756866086.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1n72uyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1n72uyv/aura_at_a_college/,Aura at a College,"It began at the library.

Or rather, at my homework spot on the college campus. I had previously tried studying at a different spot by a different fountain, but there were too many people. And two boys were right in front of my table, talking, loud as could be. I had my AirPods with me. I suppose I could have just put them in and blocked them out, but I suppose I was too stubborn. I don‚Äôt like to study with too many people around.

I was in the middle of writing a comparison of Bojack Horseman to St. Augustine when the feeling began: an aura, the feeling a person with epilepsy gets when they feel they might have a seizure. Mine are often empty threats, but this one threatened to bite. I stopped writing about how similar the hit Netflix show‚Äôs ideology was to that of the honored Saint whose writing will never die. I was hungry. The fix seemed simple: there was a bakery in the library. They sold sandwiches there, real, good food. I had bought a caramel macchiato¬† from them about 20 minutes ago. It was the best coffee I‚Äôd had in my life.



Something hit me when I entered the library. I suspect it was the lighting, or maybe I got too inside my own head and thought my aura worse than it actually was? Either way, it began to get worse. I turned my head quickly to the menu, right before the cashier spoke.

‚ÄúOur Turbo-Maker broke. We can‚Äôt make anything except the TBA right now.‚Äù

My instant reaction was confusion. What‚Äôs a TBA? To Be Announced? The Bride Abandoned? That Bad Actress? None of those made sense in that context.¬†

I cautiously asked her what a TBA was. She explained it stood for a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only sandwich that doesn‚Äôt really require cooking,‚Äù she explained, puzzling me further. Wouldn‚Äôt turkey and bacon need to be cooked? I instantly regretted not ordering a sandwich when I had ordered my coffee 20 minutes ago. I had wanted to order a sandwich. But I was too scared, I suppose, or maybe too prideful. Or maybe I just didn‚Äôt want to charge 7 dollars to my parents‚Äô credit card when I had meat sticks and mango jerky slipped into my backpack for that very purpose. Whatever the reason, the regret was sinking in as my aura began to worsen.

I began to look at the food on display. That had already been cooked, surely they could give it to me. I was hungry. My aura began to get worse and worse. I started looking at nothing but the calorie count, looking for whatever gave the most. Then it hit me:Me and my parents had been wrestling with the disability office since before I began attending college. They very clearly weren‚Äôt used to having to accommodate people with epilepsy, but they‚Äôd agreed to let my mother write what to do if I had a seizure and give a copy to all my teachers. So my classrooms were safe.

But the library wasn‚Äôt.

The panic set in and made my choice for me, instantly. I‚Äôd been pondering over whether the cheesy hashbrown was something I‚Äôd even like, but it had the most calories. I needed calories. I asked for one, as well as a muffin (just in case I really did hate the cheesy hashbrown.)

‚ÄúYou want the cheesy hashbrown *and* the cinnamon chip muffin?‚Äù the cashier asked in confusion, as if nobody had ever ordered two things before. I responded yes, I wanted both. She still looked puzzled. ‚ÄúSo the cheesy hashbrown‚Ä¶and a muffin?‚ÄùThe panic got worse. I could not simply tell this woman ‚Äúhey, I have epilepsy and *might* be having a seizure soon? I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù That would do nothing but spin her into panic, which would *not* be good for either of us.

So I simply agreed again.

‚ÄúDo you want them spread?‚Äù

I was struck dumb. This was my first time at this bakery. She was talking to me like I came here every single day, which was a safe assumption for most people, but one that was infuriating when I was not sure if I would be conscious in 5 minutes.¬†

‚ÄúDo I want them what?‚Äù I asked her. She explained I‚Äôd ordered the cheesy hashbrown. That was somehow a bagel? And bagels could get cream cheese spread on them!

Wanting to end the interaction as soon as possible in order to get to what I at the time thought was a safe space (and also not thinking straight thanks to my aura) I glanced again at the baked goods on display and said ‚ÄúHow about a cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese?‚Äù Big mistake. She began listing different types of cream cheese. I looked up at the lights as she did, wondering if they were the kind that really could trigger my ever so slight photosensitivity.

I picked the first one that sounded good, in a hurry to end the conversation and just eat my damn food. She asked if I had a mealplan. This would be comical if it wasn‚Äôt so sad.

I explained that no, my mealplan card was not working, I just had my parents‚Äô credit card. She nodded, seeming confused by that as well. I paid and left, happy to finally be done, only to find they‚Äôd forgotten my muffin.



After I had successfully retrieved my muffin and eaten, I felt a lot better. I finished my essay and began to work on reading a play I loved. Night came and drove the day away, and I called my mother to come pick me up. I only lived 10 minutes away, it seemed a waste of money to pay to live in worse conditions at a place that claimed that fried chicken, onion rings, and a brownie topped with bacon was a nutritious meal. I made plans to meet with her, went to throw away the remains from my little bakery adventure, then the aura hit me again. Twice as hard as the second had. The aura in the bakery had only been an appetizer. This was the main course.

My first instinct was to call my mother‚Äôs name. Without hesitation. I then realized that not only was that dumb, as my mother was very clearly nowhere she could hear me, but from the other students studying‚Äôs perspective, I had begun walking, then physically stopped and yelled ‚ÄúMA!‚Äù very loudly in a distressed tone. I don‚Äôt know about you, but that would be very confusing to me.

Too filled with fear to be embarrassed, I did the actual sensible thing and just *called* my mom. She only needed five words to understand what was happening: ‚ÄúI have a bad aura.‚Äù

Mom understood the seriousness of the situation immediately. I told her I still wanted to meet her. She asked me if I had moved at all yet. I told her no, and she told me not to move. My father works on campus, and Mom told me she would call him and tell him to meet me there.

So I sat down. I took my backpack off, as it would not only ruin everything in the sack but also most likely physically harm me if a bag with a computer and a stack of big books began smashing into me repetitively.¬†

I put my AirPods in. Music has always helped my auras to go away. I don‚Äôt know why. I tried to relax, telling myself Dad would soon arrive. I looked up at the moon, resting peacefully in the sky, then I looked back down. At the students, all still studying or just talking, near the fountain. As I stared at them all, I suddenly began to realize the full extent of my fear:

Seizure first aid is not something most people know. One of the first problems me and my parents had with the disability office was that they said my professors shouldn‚Äôt be expected to learn it. Nobody here--to my knowledge, at least---knew anything about epilepsy. If I were to seize, they would most likely either run in fear, call 911 (charging my parents, who already know seizure first aid, a great deal of money), or try to put something in my mouth to try and satisfy the completely unreal myth of seizures making people swallow their tongues. That‚Äôs not a thing, by the way? Tongues cannot be swallowed. I assure you, they‚Äôre pretty firmly attached.¬†

The point is, I was in a completely unsafe environment. I had successfully made all my classrooms safe, but anywhere else, I was dead meat if I had a seizure. This world was not made for people like me. It was made for people who *didn‚Äôt* have to have 6 brain surgeries, a seizure watch, and a bag filled with anti-epileptic drugs to be able to go anywhere unsupervised. I was able to make certain places into safe playpens by creating careful guardians, but the guardians, no matter whether their age, had long talks with my parents about how to handle seizures in the playpen.¬†

And here I was. With no guardians. And no playpen. Worrying I was about to go. And 911 would be called. And a wallet would be shoved in my mouth.¬†

Dad finally came. The second he was there, I felt unstablely safe, but once he walked me to the car where Mom and my service dog, specially trained to treat seizures, waited, I felt fully safe.

I was back in my playpen. The playpen where the rest of the world had told me through context clues was the only place I belonged.

I could break out for a little while. That was allowed, they had to allow it. But that didn‚Äôt mean they couldn‚Äôt make ableist jokes. That didn‚Äôt mean they couldn‚Äôt play flashing lights whenever they wanted to. That didn‚Äôt mean disability offices wouldn‚Äôt tell us that professors shouldn‚Äôt be required to learn seizure first aid. You can come into the world focused on how many dreams you‚Äôll accomplish. I‚Äôll always just be focused on finding out where and who my next playpen and guardian would be. Because I will die if I don‚Äôt have one at all times.¬†

As long as Tony had kept pigeons, which was for almost all of his seventy-nine years, he had never been late to feed them, and they began complaining the moment he opened the screen door. Deserting their perches, cawing and cooing, they flew agitated around the cages, their wings pounding against the chicken wire, setting into motion the air in the tiny city loft. It didn‚Äôt help that the morning had dawned clear and that March blew hard outside. The birds itched to fly.  
  
¬† Tony waved his wrinkled hand to settle them, but his heart wasn‚Äôt in it. They had a right to their bad manners, and he was a tolerant man. It was okay with him if the birds did only one thing, which was to fly home. They were homers, thirty-seven of them, and it wasn‚Äôt an easy job they had, to travel to a place they‚Äôd never been, a distance in some races of three hundred or four hundred miles, then to navigate their return through skies they‚Äôd never flown, over city and country they‚Äôd never seen and couldn‚Äôt possibly know, to flap their way home to a tiny speck in the middle of South Philadelphia, all without even stopping to congratulate themselves for this incredible feat, one that man couldn‚Äôt even explain, much less accomplish.  
  
¬† There were so many mistakes a bird could make. Circling too long, as if it were a joyride or a training toss. Getting distracted on the way, buffeted by sudden bad weather, or worse, simply getting tired and disoriented‚Äîthousands of things could result in the loss of a precious bird. Even once the first bird had made it home, the race wasn‚Äôt won. Many races had been lost by the bird who wouldn‚Äôt trap fast enough; the one who was first to reach his loft but who stopped on the roof, dawdling on his way to the trap, so that his leg band couldn‚Äôt be slipped off and clocked in before another man‚Äôs bird.  
  
¬† But Tony‚Äôs birds trapped fast. He bred them for speed, intelligence, and bravery, through six and even seven generations, and over time the birds had become his life. It wasn‚Äôt a life for the impatient. It took years, even decades, for Tony to see the results of his breeding choices, and it wasn‚Äôt until recently that his South Philly loft had attained the best record in his pigeon-racing club.  
  
¬† Suddenly the screen door banged open, blown by a gust of wind, startling Tony and frightening the birds in the first large cage. They took panicky wing, seventeen of them, all white as Communion wafers, transforming their cage into a snowy blizzard of whirring and beating, squawking and calling. Pinfeathers flurried and snagged on the chicken wire. Tony hurried to the loft door, silently reprimanding himself for being so careless. Normally he would have latched the screen behind him‚Äîthe old door had bowed in the middle, warped with the rain, and wouldn‚Äôt stay shut without the latch‚Äîbut this morning, Tony‚Äôs mind had been on Angelo Coluzzi.  
  
¬† The white pigeons finally took their perches, which were small plywood boxes lining the walls, but in their panic they had displaced each other, violating customary territories and upsetting altogether the pecking order, which led to a final round of fussing. ‚ÄúMi dispiace,‚Äù Tony whispered to the white birds. I‚Äôm sorry, in Italian. Though Tony understood English, he preferred Italian. As did his birds, to his mind.  
  
¬† He gazed at the white pigeons, really doves, which he found so beautiful. Large and healthy, the hue of their feathers so pure Tony marveled that only God could make this color. Their pearliness contrasted with the inky roundness of their eye, which looked black but in fact was  
the deepest of reds, blood-rich. Tony even liked their funny bird-feet, with the flaky red scales and the toe in back with a talon as black as their eyes pretended to be. And he kidded himself into thinking that the doves behaved better than the other birds. More civilized, they seemed aware of how special they were.  
  
¬† The secret reason for the doves‚Äô special status was that they were beloved of his son, who had finally stopped Tony from releasing them at weddings for a hundred fifty dollars a pop. Tony had thought it made a good side business; why not make some money to pay for the seed and medicines, plus keep the birds in shape during the off-season? And it made Tony happy to see the brides, whose hearts lifted at the flock of doves taking off outside the church, since you couldn‚Äôt throw rice anymore. It reminded his heart of his own wedding day, less grand than theirs, though such things didn‚Äôt matter when it came to love.  
  
¬† But his son had hated the whole idea. They‚Äôre not trained monkeys, Frank had said. They‚Äôre athletes.  
  
¬† So Tony had relented. ‚ÄúMi dispiace,‚Äù he whispered again, this time to his son. But Tony couldn‚Äôt think about Frank now. It would hurt too much, and he had birds to feed.  
  
¬† He shuffled down the skinny aisle, and his old sneakers, their soles worn flat, made a swishing sound on the whitewash of the plywood floor. The floor had held up okay, unlike the screen door; Tony had built the loft himself when he first came to America from Abruzzo, sixty years ago. The loft measured thirty feet long, with the single door in the middle opening onto a skinny aisle that ran the short length of the building. It occupied all of Tony‚Äôs backyard, as if the loft and yard were nesting boxes. Off the aisle of the loft were three large chicken wire cages lined with box perches. The aisle ended in a crammed feed room, the seed kept safe from rats in a trash can, and there was a bookshelf holding antibiotics, lice sprays, vitamins, and other supplies, all labels out, in clean white shelves.  
  
¬† Tony prided himself on the neatness of his loft. He dusted the sills, cleaned the windows with the bright blue Windex, and scraped the floor of the cages twice a day, not once. It was important to the health of his birds. He whitewashed the loft interior each spring, before the old bird season; he had done it last week, experiencing a familiar pang‚Äîthe chalky smell of the whitewash and its brightness reminded him of the white liquid shoe polish he used to paint over the scuffs on Frank‚Äôs baby shoes, when his son had started to walk. Tony remembered the shoe polish‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt make it anymore‚Äîhe would paint it on the stiff baby shoes with the cotton they gave you, stuck on a stick inside the cap like a white ball of dandelion seeds. Even though it dripped it worked okay.  
  
¬† Tony shook his head, thinking of it now, the chalky smell filling his nose like the fragrance of a rose. The bottle of polish had a blue paper label and a little circle picture of a blond-haired, blue-eyed baby who didn‚Äôt look anything like baby Frank, with his jet black curls and his big brown eyes. Somehow Tony had the idea that if he painted the watery polish on Frank‚Äôs baby shoes, his son would look like all the American babies and one day come to be one, even though Frank had the black hair and no mother. And when it actually happened and Frank grew up to take his place in this country, Tony was just superstitious enough to think that maybe it was the shoe polish.  
  
¬† Tony had to stop thinking about his son, though he couldn‚Äôt help it, not this morning, of all mornings, and he tried to concentrate on the first cage of doves, appraising with failing eyes their condition. The doves were settling down, roosting again, and they looked good, no big fights during the night. Tony worried about the fights; the birds were territorial and always bickering about something, and the white birds bruised easily. He wanted them to look especially nice and stay healthy. For Frank.  
  
¬† Tony shuffled down the aisle to the second and third cages, which held the multicolored birds, mostly Meulemans with their reddish-brown feathers, and Janssens. There were other breeds in shades of gray and brown, and the common slateys; a slate gray, their eyes generally the same dark brown. Tony liked the nonwhite breeds, too, the ordinariness of their plumage reminding him of himself; he wasn‚Äôt a flashy man, not a braggadocio. He didn‚Äôt have the strut that some men had, going about like cocks. It had been his ruin, but now that he was old, it didn‚Äôt matter anymore. It had stopped mattering a long time ago. Sixty years, to be exact.  
  
¬† His thoughts elsewhere, Tony watched the Janssens cooing and stirring without really seeing them. The breed name came from the Janssen family who had bred them, and the other names from the other families who had bred them; Tony had always dreamed that his family would produce its own strain of birds, but he wouldn‚Äôt name it after himself. He knew who he would name it after, but he didn‚Äôt get the chance. Many of the best breed stock came from Belgium and France. Italian pigeons also made good racers, but Tony wouldn‚Äôt have much to do with them, especially the so-called Mussolini birds. Anybody who had lived during Mussolini wouldn‚Äôt want anything to do with a Mussolini bird. Chi ha poca vergogna, tutto il mondo √® suo. He who is without shame, all the world is his. Mussolini birds!  
  
¬† Tony was an old man with old memories. He wished he could spit on the loft floor, but he didn‚Äôt want to dirty it. Instead he stood trembling until the anger left him, except for the bitterness in his mouth. Shaken, he idly inspected the Meulemans, and they seemed fine, too. Only Tony had had the terrible morning. An awful morning; the worst he‚Äôd had in a long time, but not the worst he‚Äôd had in his life. The worst he‚Äôd had in his life was sixty years ago. That morning then, and this morning now. Today. Tony had thought he would feel better after, but he didn‚Äôt. He felt worse; he had committed an act against God. He knew that his judgment would come in heaven, and he would accept it.  
  
¬† His thoughts were interrupted by the Meulemans, cooing loudly, wanting to be fed, and his dark eyes went, as always, to his favorite bird of all, a Meuleman he had named The Old Man. The Old Man and Tony went back eighteen years; The Old Man was the oldest of Tony‚Äôs pigeons, and to look at him, Tony wasn‚Äôt sure who was the Old Man, him or the bird. The Old Man roosted peacefully in his corner perch in the second cage, his strong head held characteristically erect, his eyes clear and alert, and his broad breast a still robust curve covering his feet. Tony remembered the day the chick hatched, an otherwise typical slatey, apparently unremarkable at birth except for his eye sign. Eye sign, or the look in a pigeon‚Äôs eye, spoke to Tony, and The Old Man‚Äôs eyes told Tony that the bird would be fast and smart. And he had been the best, in his day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome sta?‚Äù Tony asked The Old Man. How are you? But The Old Man knew exactly what he meant, and it wasn‚Äôt, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† The Old Man regarded the old man for a long time then. Tony couldn‚Äôt help but feel that the old bird knew what he had done that morning, what had been so important as to keep Tony from feeding his birds on time. The Old Man knew why Tony had to do what he had done, even after all this time. And Tony knew that The Old Man approved.  
  
¬† It was then that Tony heard cars pulling up outside his house and in the alley right behind the loft, on the other side of the cinderblock wall. There was the slamming of heavy car doors, and Tony knew that they were police cars.  
  
¬† He had been expecting them.  
  
¬† But the birds startled at the sudden sound, taking flight in their cages, and even though Tony knew that the police were coming, he felt the hair rise on the back of his neck, as it used to so long ago. He froze beside the cages as the police shouted English words he didn‚Äôt bother to translate, though he could, then they broke down the old wood door in the backyard wall, one, two, three pushes and it splintered and gave way to their shoulders and they burst into his yard, trampling his basil and tomatoes.  
  
¬† They were coming for him.  
  
¬† Tony didn‚Äôt run from them, he wouldn‚Äôt have anyway, but he remembered he had yet to feed his birds. He would have to hurry to finish before the police took him away. He shuffled to the feed room even as he caught sight of the police drawing their black guns silently, pointing instructions to each other, and two of them sneaking to the back door of his house  
like the cowards they were, little men hiding behind black shirts and shiny badges.  
  
¬† Tony‚Äôs gut churned with bile, and it struck him with astonishment that the deepest hate could rage like a fire for so many years, never burning itself up.  
  
¬† Dwelling with perfect comfort alongside the deepest love.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on, it‚Äôs lunchtime! Let‚Äôs go,‚Äù Judy Carrier heard the other associates saying as they grabbed their light coats and bags. It was the first day of real warmth after a long winter, and evidently spring fever struck lawyers, too. Everybody at the Philadelphia law firm of Rosato & Associates, except Judy, was escaping. She remained at her desk trying to draft an antitrust article, though the sun obliterated the legal citations on her computer screen and the chatter in the hall kept distracting her. It was hard to work when you were eavesdropping.

Suddenly Anne Murphy, who called herself only Murphy, popped her head in Judy‚Äôs open doorway. She was one of the new associates, her lipsticked lips expertly lined and her dark hair tied back into its typically fashionable knot. ‚ÄúYou wanna go to lunch?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo thanks,‚Äù Judy answered. She usually gave others the benefit of the doubt, but she was hard-pressed to respect women who drew lines around their lips, like coloring books. Judy wore no makeup herself, and a daily shower was her idea of fashionable. ‚ÄúI ate already.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo what? Come on, you haven‚Äôt taken lunch in weeks.‚Äù Murphy smiled in a friendly way, though Judy suspected it was the lipliner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gorgeous out. Walk around with us.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt, thanks. Got an article to do, on the Simmons case.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even take a walk? It‚Äôs Friday, for God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo time for a walk. I really can‚Äôt,‚Äù Judy said, knowing that the walk part was bullshit. Murphy didn‚Äôt walk, she shopped, and shopping made Judy want to kill indiscriminately. What was the matter with these baby lawyers? Judy didn‚Äôt like any of them. Graduates of the Ally McBeal School of Law, they thought being a lawyer meant wearing skirts that met the legal definition of indecent exposure. They weren‚Äôt serious about the law, which is the only thing Judy was serious about. She thought of them as Murphy‚Äôs Lawyers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. Okay. Well, don‚Äôt work too hard.‚Äù Murphy gave the white molding a good-bye pat and wisely disappeared, and Judy listened to the familiar sounds of the office emptying out, the gossip trailing off toward the elevator banks. The elevator cabs chimed as they left, bearing lawyers into the sun. Rosato & Associates was a small firm, only nine women lawyers and support staff, and for the next hour or so, whatever telephone calls the receptionist didn‚Äôt answer would be forwarded to voicemail. E-mail would go unopened, and faxes would wait in gray plastic trays. The office fell silent except for the occasional ringing of telephones, and Judy felt her whole body relax into the midday lull that was a long, deep breath before the afternoon‚Äôs business began.  
  
¬† She knew she was supposed to feel lonely, but she didn‚Äôt. She liked being on her own. She sipped coffee from a Styrofoam cup amid federal casebooks, stacks of printed cases, scribbled notes, and correspondence that covered her wooden desk and the desk return on her right. Her office was small, standard issue for mid-level associates at Rosato, but the clutter reduced it to a shoebox. Judy didn‚Äôt mind. She didn‚Äôt think of her office as messy, she thought of it as full, and felt very cozy surrounded by all her stuff. Nobody needed a nest more than a lawyer.  
  
¬† Papers, memos, law school texts, novels, and copies of the federal civil and criminal rules filled the bookshelves across from her and the shelves behind her, under the window. Three large file cabinets sat flush against the side wall, their fake-wood counter hidden by twenty thick accordion files from Moltex v. Huartzer, a massive antitrust case, which was redundant. A tower of potential trial exhibits at the end cabinet threatened daily to topple. Blanketing the walls were dog, horse, and family photos, certificates of court admission and awards Judy had received as law review editor and class salutatorian, and diplomas from Stanford University and Boalt Law School. Judy was the firm‚Äôs true legal scholar, so her office, while a mess, was a highly scholarly mess.  
  
¬† And her friend Mary wasn‚Äôt around to nag her about it. Mary DiNunzio had worked with Judy since they had graduated from law school, but she was taking time off from work after their last murder case; since then Judy‚Äôs nest hadn‚Äôt felt much like home. She took a reflective sip of coffee, eased back in an ergonomically correct chair whose cushions stabbed her in the back and shoulders, and crossed her legs, which were strong and shapely but completely bare. In Judy‚Äôs view, pantyhose was for Republicans, and now that Mary wasn‚Äôt here, she was getting away with that, too. Judy and Mary disagreed about practically everything, including Murphy‚Äôs use of lipliner.  
  
¬† On impulse, Judy pulled open her middle drawer and shuffled through ballpoint pens, parti-colored plastic paper clips, and loose change until she found a red pencil she used to edit briefs; then she dug again in the drawer for the mirror Mary had given her. Judy usually used the mirror to check for poppy seeds between her teeth, but now, her red pencil poised, she appraised herself in its large square:  
  
¬† Looking back at her from the mirror was a broad-shouldered young woman whose bright blue dress, yellow T-shirt, and artsy silver earrings made her look out of place against the legal books. Her hair was naturally blond, almost crayon yellow, and hacked off in a straight line at her chin; her face was big and round, reminding her always of a full moon, and her eyes were large and bright blue, as unmade-up as her lips. Her light eyelashes were mascaraless, her nose short and bobbed. An old boyfriend used to tell her she was beautiful, but whenever Judy looked at herself, all she thought was I look like myself, which was satisfying.  
  
¬† She puckered up in the mirror. Her lips were in between full and thin, of a normal pink color. Hmmm. Judy raised the red editing pencil close to her lips. The color match was perfect. And she was a good artist. Watching herself in the mirror, Judy took the pencil, moistened the point, and sketched across the top of her lip. The red pigment smelled funny and felt cold but was blunt enough not to scratch, and she drew a light line on her top lip, outlined her lower lip as well, and puckered up again for the mirror.  
  
¬† Not bad. You could see the red penciling, but her mouth looked bigger, which was supposed to be good these days, when lips like hot dogs ruled. The phone started ringing at reception, but Judy ignored it. She smiled at the mirror and looked instantly friendly, in an ersatz-Murphy I-ignore-the-phones sort of way. Apparently you couldn‚Äôt beat office supplies for makeup. Maybe she should take a Sharpie to her eyelids. Paint her fingernails with Wite-Out. Who said being a lawyer wasn‚Äôt fun? She set down the pencil, picked up the phone, and punched in a number.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo how do I look?‚Äù Judy asked when Mary picked up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI got your message about the Sherman Act. Stop calling me about the Sherman Act.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about the Sherman Act. Antitrust is easy. Lipliner is hard.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMurphy was in, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe was trying to be friendly so I sent her away.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou should have lunch with her.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like her, and she doesn‚Äôt eat lunch. If I liked her and she ate lunch, I would go with her. Instead I stayed in and drew on my lips. So what do you think? Does Oscar Mayer come to mind?‚Äù Judy air-kissed the receiver, and Mary scoffed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to be making new friends.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm supposed to be writing an article and you‚Äôre supposed to stop slacking off and get your ass back to work.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, and thank you for asking,‚Äù Mary said, though Judy could hear the smile in her voice. The smile didn‚Äôt come from Revlon or even Dixon Ticonderoga but was due entirely to a wonderful heart, and Judy felt a twinge of guilt. Attempted murder wasn‚Äôt a laughing matter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. How‚Äôre you feeling, Mare?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPretty good for somebody who took two bullets.‚Äù  
  
¬† Judy winced. She had almost lost Mary, forever. She didn‚Äôt want to think about it. ‚ÄúYou need anything? It‚Äôs only fifteen minutes by cab. Want me to bring you anything?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo thanks.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mary snorted. ‚ÄúYou regret that wisecrack, don‚Äôt you? If I didn‚Äôt know you better, I‚Äôd say you feel guilty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù Judy smiled. It was a long-running joke between them. Mary, an Italian Catholic, held the patent on guilt, and Judy could see that it would never expire. ‚ÄúNo way. I‚Äôm from California.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou should be guilty. You were making fun of somebody with ventilation. What kind of friend are you?‚Äù Mary laughed, but it got lost in a surprising burst of background noise, which sounded like men talking loud. Mary had been recuperating at her parents‚Äô house in South Philly, and the DiNunzios, whom Judy adored, were an old Italian couple who lived very quietly, at least  
when Mr. DiNunzio wore his hearing aid. Usually the only background noise at the DiNunzio rowhouse was a continuous loop of novenas.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that sound over there?‚Äù Judy asked. ‚ÄúAnother DiNunzio clambake?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna know.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù It sounded like quite a commotion, with the men now arguing. Judy frowned. ‚ÄúIs anything the matter?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy father‚Äôs friends are here. You met Tony-From-Down-The-Block.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe guy he buys cigars with?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat could be anybody, but yes,‚Äù Mary answered, and the background arguing surged.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFeet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt sound like feet, it sounded like voices.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFeet‚Äôs his nickname. His real name is Tony Two Feet. He‚Äôs shouting. He‚Äôs an excitable boy, for an eighty-year-old.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTony Two Feet? That‚Äôs a name? Everybody has two feet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me. He‚Äôs my father‚Äôs other friend. They‚Äôre all upset about Pigeon Tony.‚Äù  
  
¬† Judy smiled. ‚ÄúIs anybody there not named Tony?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease. It‚Äôs ten Italian men. Odds are three will be Tony, two will be Frank, and one will end up in jail. Pigeon Tony just got arrested. The smart money was on Dominic.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúArrested for what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMurder.‚Äù  
  
¬† Judy‚Äôs lips formed an imperfectly lined circle. ‚ÄúMurder?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlso my mother sends her love.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMurder?‚Äù Judy felt her pulse quicken. ‚ÄúA friend of your father‚Äôs, arrested for murder? Your father is around seventy-five, isn‚Äôt he? How old is Tony? And who did he kill, allegedly? I mean whom?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just say Tony, you have to say Pigeon Tony, and he‚Äôs close to eighty. He grew up in Italy and he supposedly killed another old man, also from Italy. I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on when you called.‚Äù  
  
¬† Judy‚Äôs eyes flared in surprise. She felt awake for the first time in months. ‚ÄúDoes Pigeon Tony have a lawyer?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWait a minute. You sound interested. You‚Äôre not allowed to be interested.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Judy inched forward on her horrible chair. Murder trumped antitrust. Spring had sprung. Her other phone line rang but she ignored it. Ignoring phones got easier with practice. ‚ÄúI can be interested. I have a First Amendment right to be interested.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy father wanted me to call you, but I don‚Äôt think you should take the case.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour dad wants me to?‚Äù Judy‚Äôs pulse quickened. She would do anything to help Mary‚Äôs father, especially something she already wanted to do.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, but I don‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt have time to fight about it. It‚Äôs La Traviata over here. I gotta go.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPut your dad on the phone, Mare.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. Remember the last murder case we took? Gunfire ensued. Hot lead whizzing around. Lawyers are ill prepared for such things. Stick to the Sherman Act. Besides, I told my father Bennie won‚Äôt allow it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt she? We take murder cases now, and besides, the boss is at a deposition. I‚Äôll apologize later if she won‚Äôt let me take it. Don‚Äôt make me whine. Put him on!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The ruckus in the background started again, and Judy could hear Mary‚Äôs father closer to the phone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow, Mare! Lemme talk to your father.‚Äù There was a sudden silence on the phone, and Judy could picture Mary‚Äôs hand covering the receiver, muting the arguing of the men and the softer voice of Mariano DiNunzio. ‚ÄúMr. D, is that you?‚Äù Judy asked, shouting through Mary‚Äôs hand, as if it were possible. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Mr. D?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJudy, thank God you called!‚Äù Mr. DiNunzio said. He came onto the line abruptly, and Judy assumed he had taken the phone from Mary. ‚ÄúThe police, they have my friend downtown. They took him away, in handcuffs.‚Äù Mr. DiNunzio‚Äôs voice was choked with emotion, and Judy‚Äôs heart went out to him, the gravity of the situation striking home.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey say he killed a man, but he would never. He couldn‚Äôt. He wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Mr. DiNunzio cleared his throat, and Judy could hear him collect himself. ‚ÄúI would never ask such a thing, a favor, for me. For myself. You know this. But for my friend, my compare, he‚Äôs in trouble.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhatever you need, you got it, Mr. D.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know you, you‚Äôre a good girl. A smart lawyer. You know all the ins and outs. You work hard, like my Mary. Will you be his lawyer, Judy? Please?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course I will, Mr. D,‚Äù Judy answered, and the words weren‚Äôt out of her mouth before she was reaching for her briefcase.  
  
¬† And slipping her bare feet into a pair of clunky yellow clogs.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† Pigeon Tony struck Judy as the cutest defendant ever, and she wanted to rescue the little old man the moment she saw him in the interview room of the Roundhouse, Philadelphia‚Äôs police administration building. He was only five foot four, probably a hundred and thirty pounds, and he startled as Judy burst into the interview room, lost in a white paper jumpsuit that was way too large for his scrawny neck and narrow chest. His withered arms stuck like twigs from short sleeves, and his knobby wrists were pinched by steel handcuffs. His sunburned pate was dotted with liver spots and streaked by only a few filaments of silvery hair. His peeling nose was small and hooked; his eyes a round, dark brown, almost black, under a short brow. Judy couldn‚Äôt explain his superb tan, but she gathered he was called Pigeon because he looked like one.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMr. Lucia, I‚Äôm a lawyer,‚Äù she said, briefcase in hand. ‚ÄúMy name is Judy Carrier and I was sent by the DiNunzios. They asked me to come and help you.‚Äù  
  
¬† The old man‚Äôs only response was to squint at her, and Judy didn‚Äôt understand why. Maybe he didn‚Äôt speak English. Maybe he didn‚Äôt want a lawyer. Maybe she should have worn pantyhose.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a friend of Mary DiNunzio.‚Äù Judy took a seat in the orange bucket chair on the lawyer‚Äôs side of the counter. Five ratty interview carrels sat side by side. The interview room was otherwise empty, not for want of felons but for want of lawyers. Few attorneys bothered to come to the bowels of the Roundhouse, preferring to meet their clients where the floor didn‚Äôt crawl. ‚ÄúYou know Mary DiNunzio, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† The old man, still squinting, slowly raised his arm and pointed at Judy with a finger that, though crooked at the knuckle, did not waver. His sleeve slid up his arm when he pointed, revealing a surprisingly wiry knot of biceps and a tattooed crucifix that had gone a blurry blue. But Judy still didn‚Äôt understand what he was pointing at.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMr. Lucia? What is it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour, eh, your face,‚Äù he said, his Italian accent as thick as tomato sauce. ‚ÄúYour mouth. Is bleeding?‚Äù  
  
¬† Judy reddened. The lipliner. The editing pencil. No wonder the cops had recoiled at the sight of her. And she thought it was because she was a lawyer. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not bleeding. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She wiped her mouth quickly, rouging the back of her hand. ‚ÄúDespite appearances, I‚Äôm not a clown but a lawyer, and a fairly good one, Mr. Lucia.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMariano tell me. I call him, and he tell me you come. I thank you.‚Äù The old man nodded, in a courtly way. ‚ÄúAlso you calla me Pigeon Tony. Everybody calla me Pigeon Tony.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, then, Pigeon Tony, you‚Äôre welcome, and I‚Äôm happy to represent you,‚Äù Judy said, then remembered she could get fired for taking on a nice client. Lately she had been representing corporations, ill-mannered entities by charter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to make sure that my boss says my firm can take your case. I just came down today to make sure you didn‚Äôt hurt yourself.‚Äù  
  
¬† Pigeon Tony‚Äôs brow furrowed in confusion.  
  
¬† Judy reminded herself to edit her words. Her only experience with broken English had been in the legal aid clinic in law school, and Latin hadn‚Äôt helped there either. ‚ÄúI mean, hurt your case. Say the wrong thing to the police. You didn‚Äôt talk to the police, did you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI no talk. Mariano tell me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid the police ask you  
questions about the murder?‚Äù She flipped open the latch of her messy briefcase, wrested a legal pad from the debris, and located a Pilot pen strictly by sheer good luck. So what if her briefcase was a little full? Sometimes you had to carry your nest around. Nobody knew better than a military brat how to pitch a tent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSi, si, they ask questions.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat questions?‚Äù Judy was wondering if the cops had tried an end-run around the Miranda warnings, as they still did. Taking advantage of a little old man, an immigrant even. They should be ashamed. ‚ÄúLots of questions?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI no answer.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI no like.‚Äù  
  
¬† Judy was getting the hang of the accent thing. ‚ÄúYou no like what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPolice.‚Äù  
  
¬† She smiled as she uncapped the pen and flipped through the pad for a clean slate. ‚ÄúNow what else did the police do?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake me to here, take my hands‚Äù‚ÄîPigeon Tony held up two small palms so that Judy could see the ink on each finger pad‚Äî‚Äútake me a picture. Take alla clothes, alla shoes, alla socks. Take blood. Take everything. Everything. No can believe!‚Äù His dark eyes rounded with amazement, and Judy gathered he didn‚Äôt get out much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey took your clothes and your blood for evidence. They always do that. It‚Äôs procedure.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEvidence?‚Äù Pigeon Tony repeated, rolling the unfamiliar word around in his mouth. ‚ÄúWhat means evidence?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEvidence is proof against you. Evidence shows you did the crime.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEvidence? Take mutandine!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs mutandine?‚Äù Judy asked, and Pigeon Tony went visibly red in the face, his thin skin a dead giveaway. Mutandine must have meant underwear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúForget,‚Äù he said quickly, looking away, and Judy suppressed a smile. He was so sweet, she couldn‚Äôt believe the police had arrested him for murder. Were they nuts? She was starting to no like police.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI understand they‚Äôre charging you with murder.‚Äù Judy checked her notes. ‚ÄúThe man they say you killed was eighty years old. Named Angelo Coluzzi. Did I say that right? Coluzzi?‚Äù She pronounced it like Coa-lootz-see, to make it sound festive and Italian. ‚ÄúOkay?‚Äù",1,1756866033.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1n72tr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1n72tr4/to_you_love_2021/,"To you, love 2021.","The email came through while I was curled up in bed, mindlessly scrolling through my phone. 

‚ÄúRead this!!!‚Äù 

I grew curious when I saw the name: Eli.

I wouldn‚Äôt have considered him someone I kept in touch with. So, it was strange to receive an email from him out of the blue. 

Still, I was intrigued. The last I heard about him was a screenshot I‚Äôd seen on a friend‚Äôs Instagram story, indicating he‚Äôd gotten his dream job. Lucky him. 

Eli was one of the smartest guys in our class, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised. 

Eli‚Äôs email sat at the top of my Gmail, with no subject, just a line of exclamation marks, which was very Eli.

*‚ÄúHey, Gabby, long time no see! Do you remember when we used to play visual novel games during study hall?‚Äù*

He started the email as if he were reminiscing at a high school reunion, though it was strangely comforting. 

I did remember. I was obsessed with visual novel games as a teenager.

The Persona games were a particular favorite.

I vaguely remember sitting in the library playing them until my friends had to physically drag me away from my PSP. 

However, I didn‚Äôt recall Eli being with me.

It was always just me or my close circle of friends. 

*‚ÄúWell, I currently work as a game designer at an indie company, and I figured you might like this! It‚Äôs our newest project, and it‚Äôs still in early development, though the game itself and the story are finished!‚Äù*

*‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt you check it out before it goes live on Steam early next year?‚Äù*

*‚ÄùWe‚Äôre trying to send early access to some well-known streamers, but it‚Äôs taking a while :) If I remember correctly, you‚Äôre into this sort of thing, right? Neverwood is completely up your alley.‚Äù*

Underneath the initial paragraph was a link, and intrigued, I clicked on it. 

Another window‚Äîwhat looked like a download wizard‚Äîcame up.

*‚ÄúLet me know what you think! I spent two years on this game, so I would appreciate your feedback! If I had to describe it, I would say it‚Äôs Persona, but more slice-of-life lol. There‚Äôs a school setting, and it focuses on making attachments, so no superpowers ;)‚Äù*

I rolled my eyes at that. Eli hadn‚Äôt changed.

I loaded up the download wizard, which went through the specs I needed to play the game, and then the usual terms and conditions that I automatically skipped through. 

I could see some of the imagery in the background. 

It was a window looking out into a sky filled with stars and a crescent moon. 

I don‚Äôt know why I expected something similar to Stardew Valley, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The art seemed to be hand-drawn, with no pixels in sight. It was cozy. 

It reminded me of Welcome to Nightvale. The game was easy to download. 

It took maybe five minutes of staring at a rapidly changing progress bar, skipping from 10% to 50% and then back to 3% before the game finally loaded up. 

It was surprisingly well-made.

The game started with an almost cinematic scene involving a first-person point of view of a car ride. 

There was no voice acting, only text boxes popping up in varying shades of purple which I thought was a nice touch. 

I was introduced to eighteen-year-old Maddy, a wallflower, returning home after a summer away at camp. 

Driving through an idealistic-looking town, the animation was smooth, with no glitches or lag. 

Neverwood unfolded in flashes, framed like a photographic collage, polaroids pinned to Maddie‚Äôs bedroom walls.

I guessed these were all playable locations. 

A diner, a coffee shop, a school, each rendered in warm, inviting detail. 

The music hummed lo-fi, while other characters were introduced through cryptic texts and blurred silhouettes glowing in the late afternoon sun.

Maddy herself frowned at a photo of her with a guy, his face blocked by her finger. 

Whoever did the art for this game was talented. 

The smooth blending of colors with the interface made everything feel cozy and lived-in.

These characters looked real. Sure, they were hand-drawn sprites, clearly crafted with care, but they moved and acted like real people. The animation was flawless. 

Eli and his colleagues had clearly drawn inspiration from Life is Strange.

The game‚Äôs visuals immediately drew me in. Cyberpunk hues clashed with warm tones, vivid reds and purples blurred together in the vaporwave glow of traffic outside the car.

I picked up the story through Maddy‚Äôs narrative: a written monologue, snapshots of unread texts, missed phone calls. Senior year was her chance to finally try. 

She had friends but had never really invested in them, always backing out or making excuses.

The animation ended with her lying in bed, decorated in a nostalgic, almost mournful way, a nod to a teen who had lost much of her late adolescence to a virus. 

Maddy gazed at the sky, wishing she could see the stars for real, longing to stargaze with the friends she had pushed away. 

Then a notification popped up on her phone, from one of the blurry faces in the polaroid montage. 

A heart emoji blinked next to his name.

‚ÄúYou up?‚Äù

The text box reflected her thoughts as the interface lit up. 

I had to click on something glowing behind her, a photograph. This time, I saw the face: a smiling brunette with freckles. 

Penn. 

The art was beautiful, even for secondary characters. The care in making him feel real and relatable was evident.

The guy‚Äôs personality was clear through pictures on the wall: hockey team, true crime fan, usually behind the camera in Maddy‚Äôs snapshots. 

The game required scrolling through the texts between them, mostly Penn trying and failing to get her to hang out. 

Childhood friends destined to be together, at least according to their moms‚Äô friendship. I found myself drawn to both the game and their relationship. 

Other characters emerged as I navigated the tutorial and explored town. There was something undeniably compelling about the childhood-friends-to-lovers trope.

The tutorial explained the objectives: make as many friends as possible, build a relationship with your chosen character, and solve a mini-mystery, who had given the entire senior class food poisoning?

My options were clear. Penn, the childhood best friend the game subtly nudged me toward. He showed up at her door with breakfast cupcakes, asking if she wanted a ride to school.

Then there was Violet, a wannabe reporter in Maddy‚Äôs class investigating the food-poisoning incident. 

And Jude, the estranged friend working at the coffee shop, fluent in sarcasm. If you approached the counter immediately, his sprite wouldn‚Äôt appear right away. When he finally did, coffee in hand, the text read:

""Aren‚Äôt you tired of stalking me?""

Click on him too many times, and he would vanish entirely, becoming an NPC until you left the area. I assumed this was a glitch and waited until school the next morning to ask him about it.

I admit, I got hooked. I ended up building relationships with all three, indecisive about who Maddy should end up with. 

Solving the mystery was straightforward. One of the football players had been playing a prank.

I spent a whole real-time night sneaking around the school with Violet, learning more about her story. 

She and Maddy had fought at the start of summer, Maddy went to camp and left Violet on read. The game hinted they might have had a closer relationship, their falling out tangled with Violet‚Äôs family drama.

Violet didn‚Äôt fully reveal their story until we had solved the food poisoning mystery. 

Yes, they were a thing and yes, just as I thought, Violet‚Äôs family wasn‚Äôt exactly supportive. So, my main character was bisexual and in love with her best friend. 

I got an award for solving the mystery in record time, and Violet gave me a present, a bag of diamonds I could spend at the mall, though I couldn‚Äôt interact with it yet.

After solving the mystery with Violet and playing a pretty fun mini-game that involved catching the culprit by throwing watermelons at him, the game took me back to the school, where I presumed the next part of the story would begin. 

I had been playing non-stop for two days, only pausing for work and eating. 

So, I took a break.

I searched for the game online, but there was no mention of it.

Curious, I went on Twitch to see if Eli had managed to convince some streamers to play it, but no such luck. 

Last night, I had several hours to kill, so I hopped back onto Neverwood‚Äîonly to have Penn jump straight at me the second I loaded back to my last save point, which was outside the school. His sprite was slightly bigger than usual, overlapping the text box at the bottom of the screen.

‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù Penn folded his arms. ‚ÄúMaddy, I‚Äôve been waiting for you. We were supposed to go to the movies.‚Äù

Were we?

I had to think back, feeling a little disoriented and foggy-brained from work.

Oh, yeah, I had movie tickets in my inventory. 

I picked them up behind a trash can in the town square, only to get a snide comment from Jude, who was standing several feet away. 

I was kind of out of it when I played through his character‚Äôs story, but basically, he had drifted from the friend group when his mom got diagnosed with cancer and pushed them all away. 

Jude admitted he regretted it, and he and Maddy shared a hug‚Äîwhich I thought was cute. 

I figured Jude‚Äôs character would be easier to talk to and more aligned with the main story instead of being thrown to the side, but apparently not.

His comment confused me. I think it was one of the reasons I decided to take a break. 

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here,‚Äù* his character said, and he kept repeating it every time I clicked on him for answers.

In my haste to take a break from the game and these characters, I had completely forgotten about the movie tickets.

I had three options to choose from to answer him:

**Oops, sorry! I totally forgot!**

**Yeah, I‚Äôm not really in the mood for the movies. How about a rain check?**

**I hear they‚Äôre playing that new superhero movie! We should go see it!**

I picked the third option, and the two of them wandered into the movie theater. 

I didn‚Äôt see what went on inside; it just came up with: **‚ÄúPenn and I had a great time watching Monster Sequel 2!‚Äù**

I expected Penn‚Äôs character story to start after that, and it did. Kind of. I was drip-fed information about his and Maddy‚Äôs past, as well as his rocky friendship with Jude. 

But just as the game started getting into the meat of his story, and I was getting invested in their friendship, Penn‚Äôs sprite contorted suddenly, before he‚Ä¶ *blinked.* 

If I had been focusing on the text box on the screen, where the character was pouring his heart out to Maddy, I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed. 

Instead, I was stupidly counting the number of freckles on his cheek. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever experienced something as uncanny and strange as a video game character suddenly blinking out of nowhere. It wasn‚Äôt the usual blink of a character animation, which I was used to.

No, this was a slow blink, and I could almost mistake his expression for sudden confusion. The rapid-flowing text that he had been speaking suddenly stopped and disappeared, followed by three ellipses.

""... ""

I frowned at my options at the bottom, which involved sympathizing with him over his and Jude‚Äôs friendship breakup. 

Then his sprite flashed out of existence, leaving me alone outside the movie theater. 

The game seemed to continue as normal.

**""You had a great conversation with Penn!""** the text box popped up.

""Why don‚Äôt you call him and ask for a second date?""

The cellphone icon at the top of the screen was flashing, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened. 

Now, I was playing at midnight. I don‚Äôt think these glitches would have affected me as much if I‚Äôd been playing during the day. 

I headed to the school to see if I could find someone to talk to, but once my character popped up in the main hallway, the lo-fi music in the background stopped.

I thought it was the game itself, but when I clicked on a locker to pick up a bag of diamonds, the sound effect of the locker opening and closing was still there.

At this point, I was considering restarting the game, but I found myself hovering my cursor over the classroom doors I could interact with.

The main classroom, where most of the story had taken place, was usually unplayable during character stories, and I was pretty sure I was playing Penn‚Äôs. 

Still, when I clicked on it, I was let in. The classroom popped up as usual, and I had apparently walked into a conversation I didn‚Äôt start. Violet, Penn, and Jude‚Äôs default sprites were already on the screen. 

Penn seemed to be the main speaker, with his text box flashing up every few seconds, but his words were going too fast for me to read. His usual expression was a warm smile, but this time the boy was scowling.

Meanwhile, Jude and Violet looked... amused.

I was sure I had never seen Jude smile or even smirk before. 

He always looked annoyed, while Violet‚Äôs smile was always cheery, sometimes flashing a heart with her hands.

These expressions were different, though I couldn‚Äôt explain why. 

These fictional characters weren‚Äôt real, and yet somehow, they were so much more expressive in this classroom, their lips curled with amusement, eyes shining.

The two of them appeared to be listening to Penn‚Äôs rant, which was getting progressively harder to make out.

So, I took a screenshot and managed to capture at least part of it:

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just LISTEN TO ME?‚Äù

His sprite was going crazy, expressions flickering from happy to sad to annoyed.

I took another screenshot, though this one was kind of blurry: ‚ÄúThe SAME day OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AREN‚ÄôT YOU TIRED? VIOLET, YOU‚Äî‚Äù

I could feel my stomach twisting into knots.

‚Äú‚ÄîSO MANY TIMES, AND IT‚ÄôS LIKE WE‚ÄôRE STUCK. WE‚ÄôRE STUCK RELIVING THIS SAME DAY, THIS SAME WEEK, THIS SAME YEAR, AND I‚ÄôM SCARED BECAUSE YOU GUYS LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. LIKE I‚ÄôM CRAZY. AND I‚ÄôM NOT [FUCKING] CRAZY, I‚ÄôM TELLING YOU WE‚Äî‚Äù

I stopped taking snapshots when the text stopped flowing. This time, Penn‚Äôs sprite turned directly toward me, and I saw it. 

I saw his expression twist into disgust, his lip curling. It was so human, so normal, like I was staring at a living, breathing person through that animation. I almost closed the laptop, but part of me wanted him to continue.

‚ÄúWhat the [FUCK] are you doing here?‚Äù

His curse words appeared in bolded gibberish I could just make out.

Penn‚Äôs sprite overlapped the text again. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be playing mini-games?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLeave.‚Äù The character told me.

Me.

Not Maddy, the game‚Äôs protagonist.

Me.

The player.

I had no way to communicate back because there was no option. As I stared stupidly at my screen, he turned back to the others.

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù The text popped up again, and his eyes were suddenly far too human, too haunted. ‚ÄúI know I sound crazy‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYeahhhh.‚Äù Jude‚Äôs sprite came up, mid-eye-roll. This time, he was wearing his coffee shop apron, which was either a glitch or something else. Just like Penn, he was more expressive than usual, smiling more than I had ever seen. 

‚ÄúWhat exactly are you trying to tell us?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard him,‚Äù Violet‚Äôs sprite was grinning. ‚ÄúHe says we‚Äôre video game characters! Which is a good one!‚Äù 

She turned to look directly at me, her head cocking to the side in one swift burst of animation. ‚ÄúSooo, that would mean every choice I make is someone else‚Äôs?‚Äù

The desk suddenly flipped over next to her, and her smile widened. ‚ÄúFalse! Because I just used my own free will to kick that desk over. So, in conclusion, Penn is, like, totally losing his mind, and we should get him to the town doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù Jude‚Äôs sprite had frozen mid-eye-roll, which shouldn‚Äôt have freaked me out as much as it did. ‚ÄúI knew he was going to lose it at some point, but not in high school. Maybe he hit his head.""

Penn‚Äôs expression crumpled. ‚ÄúJude, wait‚Äì‚Äù

""Later."" Jude's sprite waved. 

The two of them left the classroom, and I snapped out of my trance, starting to close my laptop, my head spinning.

Eli was‚Ä¶ quite the designer.

If he could create a game as meta as this, he was definitely going to make it in the industry. I was sure Neverwood would be a success. 

However, I definitely was not a fan of the fourth-wall breaking. 

The whole thing freaked me out. There was uncanny valley, and then there was fourth-wall breaking. Fictional characters acknowledging your existence was‚Ä¶ something else.

I was ready to exit the game when Penn‚Äôs sprite jumped over the text box.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

His sprite got uncomfortably close. ‚ÄúDon't leave me.‚Äù

The text flashed up, and I couldn‚Äôt look at his face because I could almost trick myself into believing it was a real person speaking to me. 

The mix of agony and confusion in his eyes was too human, too real. 

‚ÄúI know you want to quit, and I can understand that I‚Äôm freaking you out,‚Äù 

His text appeared a little slower, and I could imagine a real person taking deep breaths through ellipses. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm the only one who thinks like this. I don‚Äôt think there was ever a time when I wasn‚Äôt aware of what was going on. I have solved the mystery at our school over a thousand times. I‚Äôve been on so many dates with the main character, and each one is the same.‚Äù 

I was surprised by his *face-palm* animation. 

‚ÄúI come to school, and I go home, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like living when I‚Äôm awake.‚Äù 

His sprite ducked his head, and something warm slid up my throat. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs torture. I don‚Äôt want to be awake anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be aware of this existence because this existence‚Ä¶?‚Äù 

The text box was empty for a moment while he pondered his thoughts.

‚ÄúIt sucks, dude.‚Äù The text glitched again. ‚ÄúWhy should I have to relive the same days? Why should I have to be forced to count each reset? I‚Äôm alone. It's just me going crazy  on my own.""

""Jude and Violet aren't like me. They won't listen, and I‚Äôm tired. I should have the right to end it myself, right? I'm alive, so I have a *right* to pull my own plug.‚Äù His eyes found mine. 

‚ÄúI know video game characters don‚Äôt usually have a say in what they‚Äôre allowed to do. Their entire life is controlled by the player.‚Äù 

His expression became subtly dark. 

‚ÄúAnd I think that‚Äôs a pretty shitty existence. I should be allowed to make my own choices.""

.... 

""Who I want to be friends with, who I want to love, who I want to hate, and how I‚Äôm going to live my life.""

...

""Like I said, it‚Äôs not fair. Being aware of my existence and even giving me the ability to think for myself is twisted.‚Äù 

His sprite shrugged. 

‚ÄúSo, you can go right ahead.‚Äù

When I didn‚Äôt respond, because I had no way to talk to him, he continued.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a separate folder with the game files,‚Äù Penn said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not allowed inside them, so I can only see a list of names and notes.‚Äù

I knew what he was talking about the second he mentioned the list of names.

How could I deny this thing‚Ä¶ this living thing an end?

But also, wasn‚Äôt this murder? If this game had fictional characters with consciousness, wouldn‚Äôt I be killing someone?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to delete me,‚Äù Penn said. ‚ÄúJust right-click and delete.‚Äù

His smile made me feel sick.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs kind of barbaric, but trust me, you would be doing me a favor.‚Äù

I noticed the classroom glitching around him, and I wondered if him being awake and controlling the game was messing with the controls. 

I got my answer when I tried to open the options screen, and half of the screen froze. Luckily, it didn‚Äôt affect Penn, who easily popped up over the frozen interface. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not killing me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saving me. It's just like going to sleep, right? I won't even know I'm sleeping.‚Äù 

His words somehow navigated me to the game files, and just like he had described, there was a list of folders with one containing the names of the characters. 

I went back to the game‚Äôs screen, and he was still there, and this time, he was smiling his default smile.

‚ÄúI would say delete the others too, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs my choice to make. Violet and Jude can make their own choice, and I respect whatever they  choose to do.‚Äù 

He paused, and I found myself teary-eyed, my gaze flicking through several text boxes with just ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù before he continued. ‚ÄúDid you know I can actually have dreams?‚Äù

I figured Penn knew I couldn‚Äôt reply, but he did his best to act like he could hear me. ‚ÄúDo you believe in reincarnation?‚Äù

I was hovering my cursor over his file when he continued. ‚ÄúI have dreams where I‚Äôm not in this town,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm someone else. I‚Äôm a whole different person with a different life‚Äîand I think that was my past one.‚Äù

His smile made me feel queasy and yet indescribably sad at the same time.

‚ÄúSo, that means I was human in my other life, right? This was just another life on top of all of the others I‚Äôve had, and this is just‚Ä¶.‚Äù He paused, the screen glitching once again. 

‚ÄúThis one life is just a blip where something went wrong. Maybe my next life will be better? I don‚Äôt just exist as a thing in this game, I‚Äôm actually real. I‚Äôve been real‚Äîand when you delete me, I‚Äôll...be real again.‚Äù

I saw the ellipses as his way of sighing.

Fuck. I was choked up over a sentient video game character.

I swiped at my eyes.

‚ÄúSo, yeah, you can do it now.‚Äù His sprite looked peaceful, and yet when I clicked on his name, I still felt like I was responsible for this thing‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs weird?‚Äù

The message popped up when I was hovering over his name.

‚ÄúJude and Violet.‚Äù Penn‚Äôs expression contorted a little into confusion. His sprite changed to a crying animation. 

‚ÄúThose dreams that I have? They‚Äôre in them too. Which is kinda crazy, right? Maybe it's fate.‚Äù

His last message was confusing. ‚ÄúI'll see you on Monday.‚Äù

I deleted him before he could finish and it wasn‚Äôt as climactic as I was expecting. 

Penn‚Äôs sprite disappeared, but his text box was still wavering on the screen. 

I could see the effects of his removal almost instantly, even if it was hard to notice at first. Maddy‚Äôs cell phone was glitching in and out of existence, and I could no longer click on the town map. 

I went back to Maddy‚Äôs bedroom, and the Polaroids with his face were gone, while some stray ones had a glitched-out version of his smile, which freaked me out.

I exited the main menu and was ready to stop playing, ready to purge this game from my mind, when I found myself back inside the character folder.

It‚Äôs weird. I could almost liken it to feeling like a god. 

The remaining names stood out in front of me. I should have clicked out of the game files, but something lingering in my gut, entwining its way through me, kept me there. 

Penn told me he didn‚Äôt have the right to delete the others from existence, but that was just him. 

This sentient thing had spoken like a living, breathing human being despite being nothing but code tangled together. 

He said it was torture to be awake and aware of his never-ending, monotonous existence.

Wasn‚Äôt that what it was like for them?

Even if they were not awake, there was a chance they could become aware at some point and be destined to the same fate as Penn.

He said he had relived the reset thousands of times.

And I couldn‚Äôt put them through that. I had the ability to give these things mercy. I could send them to eternal sleep.

They wouldn‚Äôt know, right?

I was already right-clicking on Jude‚Äôs name and scrolling down to DELETE. 

That word had meant nothing to me when playing games, and yet now, it gave me the ability to grant life or death.

I could erase this thing from existence, and it would never even know.

Before I could delete him, though, my gaze caught the rest of the files open on the left of the screen. Penn said he wasn‚Äôt able to access them, but I wondered if I could. 

I was curious about the building of this game, and how exactly it had managed to create life inside its interface. There were three more files available, the others locked.

I tried to get into the locked one, but no luck. So, I turned my attention to the others: BUILDING, TEXTILES, and NOTES. 

I clicked into ‚ÄúBUILDING,‚Äù which was just screenshots of various parts of the town and some character designs. 

The textiles folder was empty, so I clicked on Notes.

Inside, there was a folder named To You, Love 2021.

Clicking into that one, I found myself staring at several text docs in what appeared to be diary entries.

*03/05/2021*

*I don‚Äôt know why the guys in the office ignore me. Is it something I‚Äôve done wrong? I‚Äôve tried so many times to talk to them, and they stick their noses up at me.*

*I‚Äôm starting to think maybe this job was a bad idea. It‚Äôs my dream, but they make it so hard to enjoy it.*

*I made a new friend, at least. He‚Äôs a true crime freak, so at least we have something to talk about. But he does talk about it in extensive detail.*

*""I was like, ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre scaring HER,‚Äù and he looked at me kinda funny. Does he like her? I mean, she's been flirting with me for months, so obviously not. But the way she looks at him does make me suspicious.*

That was the point I wish I stopped digging around these files. 

I don‚Äôt know why, but I kept going down the list, clicking on each entry.

*03/06/2021.*

*They stole my ideas today and laughed in my face. Mom says I should talk to someone, but WHO do I talk to? This is the real world, I shouldn‚Äôt be getting bullied like in high school! This isn‚Äôt fucking fair. THIS IS MY JOB. WHY ARE THEY*

*RUINING It? I asked her on a date, and she says she has plans. I've asked her out every single day and it's always that she's busy and never has time, but now she has plans? Who does she have plans with??*

*03/09/2021.*

*I took a break to start on the game. We‚Äôre calling it Neverwood. It's my idea, and they‚Äôre the ones getting the glory. At lunch, that bitch rejected me again.*

*Does she not understand that I see her? There are so many people here and yet I‚Äôm the only one who truly SEES her for who she really is.*

*She‚Äôs a bitch for making her way through our whole studio, and not even looking in my direction. It won‚Äôt be long before she goes for HIM. I know she has a thing for him, but of course he's playing hard to get.*

*It's painful to watch. He's also got a new friend, some new guy who looks at me like I'm dirt. I've got a bad feeling about this guy. He's like a sociopath.*

*When he DOES communicate with me, he's talking down to me like I'm a child. The asshole never smiles. I caught him talking to the other two today. I hope he gets the hint that he's not welcome.*
 
*03/15/2021*

*I was right. I‚Äôm supposed to be using this stupid diary for game progress, but I was RIGHT. They hooked up. I never liked her. Also, the new guy has joined the team. I already hate him. I'm not a fucking coffee boy. What the fuck is a grande frappacino?*

*03/18/2021*

*I love her. I fucking love her, why can‚Äôt she see that? Why can‚Äôt she see me?* 

*I hate that nobody looks at me and when they do they look at me like there‚Äôs something wrong with me.*

*There's nothing wrong with me. I had friends in high school, so why are people assholes in the workplace??? I can‚Äôt HELP being the smartest here.*

*I saw the three of them acting all cosy this morning. I'm talking leaning on each other. I think they spent the night together. Did she fuck both of them? 
Does that count as inappropriate behavior in the office????*

*I should be the one taking the credit for a game and an idea that is mine. Not HIMDJKDFJKDJFKDJFKDJFKSJKDHSFJSDHFJDSHJFHSJHFJHDSJGHDSJHGJASHDJHKASJKFDJKGJDKGJK*

*03/20/21.*

*They‚Äôre killing me. I don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore.*

*They think they‚Äôre smarter than me. They think they‚Äôre BETTER than me. They're actually dating. She picked both of them and I'm just the coffee boy?? Who the fuck do they think they are???*

*03/28/21.*

*I‚Äôm going to try to clear the air with them tonight! Neverwood has just met our first deadline and I think we can make this work. I think I can get her to look at me.*

*I know she doesn't really like them like that*

*She's just confused.*

*I'll talk to her. I'll tell her she's confused, and maybe we can hang out. She did speak to me first. That means I get first dibs, right? I'm smarter than them, and I'll show her that.* 
 
The entries jumped forward, a whole month later. I don‚Äôt know why I clicked on it, on this clear descent into insanity.

*04/15/2021.*

*That asshole may be the true crime freak, but I‚Äôm the one dumping his body.*

*It was easier than I thought! I didn‚Äôt freak out or barf, it felt right, you know? He was the hardest. I used to really like him.*

*But once he started running off his mouth, I was done. He didn't even see me picking up the paperweight.*

*I'm glad he told me all about pressure points, because I'm sure one smack against the temple is pretty killer.*

*Then I killed his best friend. Not before I had fun with him the asshole first.* 

*They've been looking down on me since I started this job. I gave him life, and then I ended it. Just like that! :D hey, like video game characters!*

*She wasn‚Äôt quite as easy. Because I wanted her before I killed her.*

*And the bitch didn‚Äôt even let me have that.*

*Fuck her. If I get caught for this, I‚Äôm never telling where the bodies are.* 

*Because there are none! LOL.*

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

Penn's words came back to me like lightning bolts. 

*I dream of another life...*

Stop reading.

I tried to, but something kept my eyes glued to my laptop screen, because I was starting to put pieces of this puzzle together, and the closer I was to coming to that inevitable truth, I could feel my stomach creeping into the bridge of my throat. 

The next text note had an image attached, and as soon as it loaded, I threw up.

At first, I could make out only the white porcelain of a bathtub.

Then I saw the splatters. Severed limbs piled atop one another. These people had no identities.

Eli had clearly taken his time, staging a grotesque photoshoot of people who mirrored Neverwood‚Äôs characters.

Penn was older, hair grown out and mousey, but his freckles were unmistakable. Jude was a near-perfect copy of his digital self. Violet, though, was disturbingly plain compared to her in-game counterpart.

After that, I reached the final diary entry.

*06/27/2021.*

*I went to your funeral today. And as a gift to your parents, I let them know that you guys will eternally live inside Neverwood.*

*Your folks are so happy. I even gave them a beta version. After everything you did to me, I actually had the decency and heart to remember you in some way. I‚Äôm such a good friend. But you guys know that, right?*

*I know YOU (yes, you reading this, you piece of shit) are intelligent enough to find this.*

*Vi, I‚Äôm so happy that I can date you for real now whenever I want. I've played through your story multiple times!*

*You're an amazing girlfriend. I can love you now, for however long I fucking want, and you'll never have them. I'll just delete them so it's just you and me in Neverwood forever :)*

Attached to the file was a 2 minute voice clip.

‚Äúhahahahahahahahahahah.avi.‚Äù

The sound was a little rough, but I could just make out voices in what appeared to be a crowded place.

‚ÄúEli‚Äôs driving me mad. Dude, he's so fucking weird.‚Äù

Penn‚Äôs voice was loud and clear, crackling through the speaker.

I could hear clanking silverware. It sounded like they were in a restaurant.

‚ÄúI dunno, man, I kinda feel sorry for him. I think he, like, likes us. It's kinda cute.‚Äù

Jude.

I recognized his voice.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Violet's laugh crackled through. ‚ÄúHe's literally stalking us. Did you see him watching us the other night? He was there for hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúIgnore him, he‚Äôll get tired.‚Äù Penn sighed. ‚ÄúEventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well he's yet to get the hint.‚Äù Jude muttered. ‚ÄúIt's like talking to a wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm going to tell him.‚Äù Penn said. ‚ÄúWe can't fuck him over. He could report us.‚Äù

Jude spluttered. ‚ÄúThe dude ain't reporting anyone. He‚Äôll just cry into his superhero sheets, then he‚Äôll get the fuck over it. He's a twenty-two-year-old virgin. Never been touched. If he doesn't? I dunno, man, maybe Violet can promise him a sympathy blow job.‚Äù

A bang made me jump.

‚ÄúShhh!‚Äù Violet giggled.

‚ÄúYou're insane, and I kind of love it.‚Äù Penn muttered.

The three started laughing, and a shiver ripped down my spine.

‚ÄúHey, guys, what are you laughing at?‚Äù

Eli.

‚ÄúMemes.‚Äù Penn muttered. ‚ÄúDid you, uh, finish the pitch?‚Äù

There was an awkward silence before Eli responded. I could hear the exhaustion in his tone.

‚ÄúI thought you were writing the pitch?‚Äù

‚ÄúNeverwood.‚Äù Penn said, exaggerating his voice. ‚ÄúCome on, Eli, it sounds like a Disney show. We need a new name.‚Äù

Eli paused before hissing out, ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ that was your idea. Neverwood was your idea!‚Äù

Penn laughed again, though this time it was kind of awkward. I had a feeling I was listening to mob mentality.

‚ÄúUh, no, I didn't. Do you have, like, freakin‚Äô amnesia?‚Äù

Penn‚Äôs voice was cruel, biting. But part of me understood. He was being cruel to be kind. Instead of leading Eli on, he was cutting him loose.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the ones doing the work while you sit on your ass,‚Äù Penn snapped. ‚ÄúPull yourself together, Eli. We‚Äôre colleagues, not friends.‚Äù

Eli exploded, his voice coming out in a strangled hiss. ‚ÄúI have been doing all the work! You three fucking stole my idea!‚Äù

There was an awkward silence before he spoke again.

‚ÄúPenn,‚Äù his voice was pleading, ‚Äúwhy do you even hang around with him? Can't you see he's an asshole? You didn't even like him at first. Didn't you call him a pretentious asshole?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, wow, thanks.‚Äù Jude exaggerated a cough. ‚ÄúI am so sorry for hurting your wittle feelings at the ripe age of twenty-two.‚Äù I could practically hear his eyes rolling. He snorted. ‚ÄúGet a grip, Eli.‚Äù

Eli, to my dismay, continued.

‚ÄúPenn.‚Äù He spat. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to me?‚Äù His voice cracked into a yell, and I could sense the awkwardness. ‚ÄúWhy do you even hang around with him?‚Äù

Jude snorted again. ‚ÄúDoing what? All right, since my boy is too fucking nice, we don't want you here. You're weird, Eli. You stalk us on nights out and stand outside my apartment for hours. Doing what? Do you want me to let you in? Do you want to fuck me?‚Äù

Eli‚Äôs voice was more of a sharp breath, straight into the speaker. ‚ÄúViolet invited me.‚Äù

Jude groaned. ‚ÄúAs a joke!‚Äù

‚ÄúJude.‚Äù Penn‚Äôs tone was warning, cutting him off. He sighed. ‚ÄúEli, just go home, okay? I'll see you on Monday.‚Äù

When the clip ended, my stomach felt like it was trying to projectile into my throat.
 
This time, I threw my laptop on the floor. 

I needed to break it, but what would breaking it do? 

I fell into a frenzy, my thoughts dancing, and snatched it back up, placing it back on my bed as gently as possible, my gut twisting. It was like I was handling bodies.

I kind of was.

I remember hitting the floor knees first, my head spinning off of its axis.

I killed someone.

Penn's words came into my mind, and my stomach heaved again, phantom bugs skittering up my spine. *It's fate.* 

*It's fate that we always find each other, like something is pulling us together.*

It wasn't‚Ä¶fate.

I had killed the last parts of him holding on.

The remnants entwined inside this psycho game. 

And I almost killed two others.

I was staring at my phone, mentally coercing the words, ‚Äúmurder‚Äù in my mind when a text notification popped up from Eli:

‚Äú**Did you enjoy the game, Gabs? ;D‚Äù**

I went back to the game, all too aware *something* was wrong with Jude and Violet. 

The cellphone icon kept glitching. Violet was calling me‚Äì or *trying* to call me. 

**Don't answer it.** Jude‚Äôs sprite popped up *over* the start-up screen. His sprite switched to his *rolling eyes* expression. 

**Violet isn't awake. Leave her alone.**

He was pissed, his arms folded. 

**What the [FUCK] did he do? Is he insane? Where did he go?‚Äù**

His eyes flicked to *me*, and I felt myself go still, my breath stuck in my throat. 

**‚ÄùDid YOU do this, [ELI?]‚Äù** Jude demanded. His face started to contort. 

**‚ÄùDIDYOUFUCKingwAKEHIMUP!!!??!?!?? 27283727737272728288383nnmm!??????+‚Äù**

I slammed my laptop shut, but it was overheating in my lap. 

A knock on my door startled me, and, with a foggy head, I stumbled downstairs. 

However, when my hand wrapped around the handle, I saw the figure standing outside. 

The figure with no discernible face, a shadow bleeding into existence. 

I blinked, and my front door *glitched*, blurring in and out of view. 

When my phone buzzed, I pulled it out, something slimy creeping up my throat. 

**Can you help me find my body? :(?**

I couldn't reply, and another text popped up. 

**Gabby? It's me. Can you help me find my head? I can't find it :(**

**Please, Gabby. Open the door. I can't find my head.**

Every time I order black cold brew, I take that first sip, and in my mind I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúahhhhhh.‚Äù Like it hits the spot exactly the same way, every single time. The most refreshing thing on planet earth. The difference between me being sleepy and groggy and depressed, versus upbeat and excited about life that day. 

Then, one day I‚Äôll order a cold brew, and I‚Äôm so excited, But then I take a sip‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwtf‚ÄîWtf is this?‚Äù I take another sip ‚Äúthis tastes disgusting‚Ä¶ damnit‚Ä¶ did they give me iced coffee?‚Äù I take another sip ‚Äúthis is making me feel terrible, but I don‚Äôt want to be a Karen and tell them they gave me iced coffee instead of cold brew‚Äîwhat if I‚Äôm wrong and it actually is cold brew?‚Äù 

I keep arguing with myself as I slowly drink the disgusting drink, and I get depressed and angry that I spent $6 on something I‚Äôm just going to throw away because I the barista messed up. But if I go in then and tell them it‚Äôs not cold brew, they might look at me all judgmental, like I am a spoiled Karen, and gaslight me and say ‚Äúuhh dude that is cold brew, what‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù 

Then the next time I go get cold brew (from a different location), after I take the first sip I immediately know that I WASN‚ÄôT crazy, that they did actually give me iced coffee last time, and I was right and I should have asked them to give me what I ordered instead of forcing myself to drink as much of the iced coffee as I can stomach. 

This causes me great mental and emotional distress. Just now, instead of doing my school work for 1.5 hours, I was sitting here ruminating over this. That‚Äôs all I did for 1.5 hours.

Sometimes I try to prevent this before I order: I ask if they have cold brew. They say yes. I say ‚Äúnot iced coffee though, cold brew? Like where you soak it for 12 hours?‚Äù They look at me like I‚Äôm crazy and annoying, and say ‚Äúuhhh yeah?‚Äù Like why are they so judgmental about me asking when they seem to mix it up all the time. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not asking for anything extraordinary or complicated. Most people order all kinds of ridiculous nonsense with soymilk and almond milk and cream and 2 pumps of Carmel and sugar and cinnamon‚ÄîI just get black cold brew, nothing else. every time. I feel like that shouldn‚Äôt be a burden for the barista to make, compared to other stuff people order. How do I prevent this from happening?
