1jo9y1h,https://v.redd.it/ishp0eolg2se1,Tips for my fellow multitaskers,"Hi guys! I‚Äôve learned a couple of things while making coffees and trying to cut down on the time I spend making a multiple drink order. I‚Äôm not sure if these have been discussed before, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got so far (I‚Äôve tried these with the Basic Brew machines and the Luxe 360 machines):

- It takes 6 seconds for the coffee grinder to grind the beans enough to get to the sweet spot of ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. Any longer or shorter and you get ‚Äúokay‚Äù. One way to time this is to watch the animation of the beans; it‚Äôs one second per animation.

- Related to the above, it takes about 7-8 seconds for an espresso to hit the sweet spot. This means that if you start the coffee machine and IMMEDIATELY start the grinder, you can grind the beans just in time to stop the coffee machine. I took a video of this to demonstrate, which also shows the animations to help time the beans.*

- When making hot lattes, you have enough time between starting the coffee machine and hitting the sweet spot to fill the jug with milk and place it at the steamer. 

- This takes a bit of practice and a sense of your own timing, but it‚Äôs possible to start the coffee machine, start steaming the milk, stop the machine, move the mug, AND get the milk perfectly steamed without breaking your stride (basically starting/doing each part while waiting for the previous one to finish). This is a bit complicated, but it‚Äôs possible. If you can practice this, the main thing you‚Äôre waiting for will be for the second part of steaming. I took a video of this too to show what I mean.*

- Your other hand is your friend. Use both hands to start/stop things in time without blocking your view of the screen. 

*For the videos, I had to put them together so Reddit would post both of them in the same post. I hope it‚Äôs clear where video one ends and video 2 begins! I made them with different orders.",1,1743444837.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,0.99,False

My concerns: After I pour my shot of espresso, the puck left in my portafilter is very wet and soggy. And then during my shot, the coffee seems to spurt out of the side. Overall I feel like the coffee is not distributing properly through my portafilter or puck screen or there's another leading cause.

I use a grinder to grind my coffee beans on the finest setting 'espresso' but I feel like it's still not fine enough.

So here is my log, in its original written form: a journal entry.¬†

I woke up, I didn‚Äôt brush my teeth, I didn‚Äôt do my hair. I did sit on TikTok watching a girl eat steaks for half an hour and certainly made enough time to reprimand my husband for not paying attention to me and not replying to his friend‚Äôs texts. Finally, I got out of bed to the smell of freshly made coffee and waffles (calling myself lucky to have this be a part of my wake-up routine, and by the way, he is an angel - the kind of human anyone should aspire to be - and aren‚Äôt I talented for being able short even his cherubic comings). I also made enough time to consider my place in the world, my faults, my stressors. I considered my to-do list for the week, not long enough not to start on any of it, reopening social media as the perfect excuse for my paralysis.¬†

Circling back to the lessons I teach versus the lessons I learned today, perhaps I am to blame. I hadn‚Äôt thought about it until recently, but maybe the reason people don‚Äôt make a big deal about my goings-on is that I don‚Äôt make a big deal about them either. I have such a difficult time talking about myself, which might be why I‚Äôm scared to write, too. And as someone who also only recently discovered that I, an aquarius, am not in touch with my emotions (an astrological shock to a rather sensitive, self-proclaimed empath - that‚Äôs important because not all self-proclaimed empaths are actually empathetic), I wonder if it‚Äôs not just me ceaselessly caring too much about how I‚Äôll make others feel.

anyway, i didn't see him again for a while, but when it happened rarely he wouldn't stop staring at me and posing in my presence. and yet, he never did anything, BUT i DON'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT. i didn't do anything either, because i was quite intimidated by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexchanging a few words.

time passed and the other day i approached a boy (still at university) i used to see around a lot and i suggested we have a coffee together sometime.

at the time i had no romantic intentions (that's why i found the courage to talk to him), but i thought ""why not? He seems nice to be around‚Äù and i talked to him.

however i found out that he and my old crush are friends and study together sometimes. and since then my old crush ignores me every time we are in the same room together (which he didn't do before).

My niece was a great kid - met some other kids and did a 180 between 8th and 9th grade.  She moved out at 14 to live with her bf and his mother and siblings for more ""freedom.""  She was baited by her bf's mom with no curfew, no emphasis on school, vapes, etc.  My sister was recently put into the state mental hospital for having hallucinations and becoming a danger to herself and others - it's no surprise my niece left as things were bad long before then. 

 I just moved back to the state about a year and a half ago, and learned of this whole mess- and have been trying to get my niece out of the bad situation she was in with the bf's mom.  The fantasy life she thought she was getting at 14 turned into a nightmare as she became Cinderella and babysitter to the BFs mom, and sex slave/ punching bag to the bf.  It took her losing her job, but finally in July, she moved in with me....but it's been a long road.

At first, I knew she needed some time to adjust to  the peace in our home.  I have a 17 y/o daughter and 2 sons 15 and 14.  We live a normal, family oriented life - school, sports, homecooked meals etc.  My niece has never really had stability and routine.  I knew she needed a little time to adjust and we gave it to her.  I also immediately started her seeing a therapist so she could start the healing process.   After a couple of weeks, I brought her into the kitchen clean-up rotation and asked her to be responsible for her own laundry.  She had graduated from an alternative program high school - and I asked if she was interested in looking at further education or programs.... she had stated she was interested in cosmetology, and we started looking into programs.

Now, as we were doing all this - it became apparent that she had no real knowledge of how the world worked - she was stumped about application terminology and didn't know things like how to open a bank account or what a high school transcript was.  She had been working at a local sandwich shop for two years and was a good worker.  She only lost her job because the bf's mother kept coming in and causing problems.   My niece isn't incapable of learning- she's just a victim of not being taught. 

I spent a good chunk of July, August, and September teaching her the basics of life - budgeting, applications and resumes, interviewing for jobs and educational programs etc.  I even hired a tutor to help her get caught up 3 days a week while I was working and my kids were at school.  

She was doing well and seemed to be grateful for the help.  She was still talking to some of her old friends, but with us living an hour and a half away - she was away from the lifestyle she had become a part of.  She got her drivers' license and had begun looking for a job.   

I will admit, we live in a small beach tourist town, so finding a job in the winter isn't easy - especially for someone with limited skills and education.  She was looking, but became increasingly lazy as time had passed - acting as more of a guest than a productive member of our household - even beginning to anger my teens as she was ""being a leech"" and ""taking advantage.""   I mean, they're 100% correct - she sleeps, watches TV, eats, hardly does a thing to help out.  I shouldn't have to police a 19 year old to do the damned dishes a couple times a week, or clean up after herself- ESPECIALLY since she was allegedly slaving away all the time before.  

I had finally just about had it when she got a job last week.  I was to the moon for her.  Granted - it only pays $15/hour, but it is full time for a small Mexican restaurant/drive-thru and she was so happy the first couple of days she worked. She had yesterday off and was scheduled to work today 11-7.  I am working from home, and happened to come into the kitchen for coffee around 10am.  She was talking to someone about  calling in today because ""she just was exhausted and needed time to adjust to working.  These people are ridiculous to expect her to be ready  for full-time after not working for so long""  üò≥üôÑüî™

I told her if she quits or gets fired for absenteeism - she will need to find a new place to live...and I was 100% not joking.  WIBTAH?  ",3,1743444271.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Anyways, my (21F) boyfriend (21M) and I have been together for about two and a half years.
He is not broke; he has a LOT of money saved up from side gigs in high school. For context, when we first started dating, we both lived at home with our moms. My dad passed away from cancer a few years ago, but my mom is a nurse and makes okay enough money to support the family and still have a bit left over, so things are okay. About a year into our relationship, he had to move out of his mom's house (not his fault, just circumstances). He moved in with his long-time best friend for a while, but his friend did him extremely dirty, and he had to move out again. My mom, being the sweetest woman ever, decided to let him stay in our house just until he could find a place to live and didn't charge him for anything. He lived with us for a little over a month, until I found him an apartment, and my mom, being the sweet person she is, co-signed on his lease because he couldn't get it alone. He lived there for about a year. About a week before Christmas, we got the news that my mom had breast cancer. Thankfully, it was caught early, but she was told she would need about 6 months of chemotherapy. During this time, she has felt like absolute crap because of the chemo, and because of that, she had barely been able to work. As soon as we got the news, I decided I would take the semester off from college (nursing pre-reqs) and work to try and take some of the financial burden off of my mom. She refused and said it would make her feel even worse if she knew that I was falling behind in school because of her, and told me that what she needed was for me to just take care of her, so that's exactly what I‚Äôve been doing. Since I'm the oldest daughter, and my sibling is still in high school, I am my mom's primary caretaker. We have a spare room that is furnished, so my mom decided she would rent the room to bring in some extra income. Around the same time we found out about my mom, we also found out that my boyfriend's apartment had black mold. He and my mom came to an agreement that he would pay $1,000 a month to stay in the spare room. She liked him at the time, so she said that the price would include utilities and food, etc., and that all he had to pay was the $1,000 for the rent. Even through chemotherapy, my mom helped him fight to break the lease, but his apartment complex was trying to charge him a crazy fee, so he couldn't. He moved in anyways, and my mom didn't nag him about money because he was still paying rent at his apartment, and she felt bad for him, but any decent person, I feel like, would feel compelled to at least help out with maybe a bill here and there or buy groceries or just give my mom some money for her troubles if they're not being charged full rent. Since he's lived here, things like water and electricity have gone up a lot. We buy 2 dozen eggs every two weeks, sometimes more. Since he has lived here, we have been buying eggs every week, sometimes less. My mom's taste buds are destroyed from chemo, so her nice brand coffee that she loves so much has been mainly untouched by her. I think she's had coffee maybe 6 or 7 times in the past 4 months. He drank it all. Same thing with the sugar, oil, toilet paper, etc. He doesn't replace it; he just waits for my mom to send me grocery shopping. My mom doesn't want to embarrass him, so she started by just mentioning that bills had gone up and whatnot. That didn't do anything. She started asking him if maybe he thinks it would be nice if he helped out with things more since he's not paying rent here, but he didn't. I had a formal conversation where I told him that we were really struggling financially and that he needed to help out if he wasn't going to pay rent, so he reluctantly gave my mom $200 for the 2 months he had already been living here. They came to an agreement that he would buy his own eggs, and when the coffee ran out, I told him he needed to go buy more. I'm not a coffee person, so I don't know brands or names, but my mom gets a specific type of K-pods from Costco, and she loves coffee, so she gets the good stuff with like 120 pods. He brought back Great Value original roast with 48 pods. There have been other things that have caused tension that have nothing to do with money, so my mom and I got fed up and told him he would need to find another place to live by the 31st. (Today.) He had a little over a month's notice. Other than the $200 he hasn't paid, a single dime. My mom and I are both very upset with him because we've communicated that he needs to contribute multiple times very clearly, and he thinks that $200 for staying here for over 3 months, with the expenses he has generated, is enough. My mom is saying that if he doesn't at the very least pay for this last month that he has lived here, and that if it's a bs amount like last time, that she doesn't want to see him here anymore. I am just about ready to end things once he moves out because the blatant disregard for the situation my family is in is insane.
So, am I overreacting for thinking it's messed up that he's acting like this? Or am I being mean? I don't want to be mean and hurt his feelings, I just feel any decent person would have it in them to think,
‚ÄúThis family is struggling and I'm causing more expenses, maybe I should help out because I have the funds to"". But no, saving money is more important to him.

1jo9lee,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jo9lee/best_external_grinder_to_use_with_ninja_luxe_cafe/,Best External Grinder to use with Ninja Luxe Cafe? [$250],"Just got a Ninja Luxe Cafe, before this I was on K cup pods so as it stands this coffee and espresso is a massive night and day difference. Since this is my first espresso machine, I joined this subreddit and went down the rabbit hole for machines and grinders. 

My question is, would I gain anything by picking up a Baratza Encore ESP grinder and just using that instead of the built in grinder on the Ninja? Just noticing some inconsistent weight on the grounds and everyone saying an external grinder is the best.

Will I notice any big difference with this entry level grinder vs the built in one on the Ninja?

Also, would I notice any difference going from Encore Esp to the Niche zero?

Eventually I‚Äôd like to get a new espresso machine but just got this one so I‚Äôll use this for a while.

I make espresso drinks and drip (classic) coffee through the Ninja Luxe Cafe so ideally a grinder that can do both. Using Medium - Medium Dark Beans.

1jo9j8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jo9j8v/the_lightning_in_this_town_wants_me_dead/,The Lightning in This Town Wants Me Dead,"The first time I was struck by lightning was in the summer three years back. I was coming home from working on a neighbor‚Äôs car when the rain started, a red-black cloud like a slit gut splitting the sky in half.

Well, about damn time, I thought. It had been a dry August, and a little moisture would have done the town good. 

It was as I got out of my car that a feeling up the back of my neck gave me pause. Growing up near bear country you get to know the sense of some big animal watching you, and I had that same sense then, only it came from where that dark cloud bled and threatened a storm. 

I‚Äôd never held with Walpurgis town superstition, nor what folks said about the things living in the National Park nearby, or what was walking in the mountain forests beyond; if you listened to the way people get going around here you‚Äôd think that there were devils and spirits of all kinds just about everywhere you looked.

It was just talk, that‚Äôs all I figured. 

But as I looked up at that dirty cloud and heard the start of thunder I could hardly move with the dread of that storm coming in. I stood where I was like my boots had been nailed down to the driveway, the rainfall soaking my shirt through to the skin.

Still the ‚Äòbear feeling‚Äô ran up and down my neck, and if my legs had worked right I would have ran.

The first visible lightning flash came so close that I could smell the reek of sulphur and ozone. Felt the heat of it blast me like the first step out of an aircraft into a tropical country. I remember thinking that it was a bluff charge, trying to scare me off out of its way, only for all I wanted to I still could not move.

Fear like that gets people killed in the wilderness every day, and right there in the heart of Walpurgis I came close. There was another growl of thunder, and even before the second bolt of lightning struck I knew that it would hit me. That what was up there in the sky was no natural weather phenomenon but something like the mountain god the cult up in Hill Town kneel to, as the rumors go.

‚ÄúBlack bear,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúHunter lightning.‚Äù

Funny where our minds go at times like that.

I recall a pull like hands all down the back of me yanking me to the ground, then a light in my eyes of such a whiteness I thought it‚Äôd burn me blind. Next thing I knew I was on my back in the driveway, my throat full of smoke, and then my wife was running out of the house screaming my name and pulling my clothes off where they‚Äôd melted down to the skin.

‚ÄúJesus, Ann,‚Äù I heard myself say distantly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alright. Just get me up and inside. Ain‚Äôt safe out here.‚Äù

The shock had washed my fear into calm, and in a way I wish it hadn‚Äôt, being that it made it easier to forget what I‚Äôd felt before that bolt knocked me down.

I brushed it off as something I‚Äôd imagined in the panic of being caught out in a storm, terror attaching character and purpose to something that had none. It was an accident, I said to myself, that was all.

I spent a couple of days holed up in a hospital ward, counting my blessings that I only had second-degree burns. More visitors came by than I cared to see, being that my ordeal had exhausted me to the point I would have gladly killed a man if it meant that I could sleep some.

Ann got me through it all, sitting by me with her hand in mine no matter the time, day or night. Though she didn‚Äôt talk much I had the notion she‚Äôd seen something that afternoon that spooked her. Seen, or felt it like eyes on her as she ran out to pick me up off the ground.

A hostility, she‚Äôd later call it. Not a thinking sort of hatred, like a human being would have, but like something startled in the woods and mad about it.

Once I was out of the ward and my burns had healed up I went back to work, pushing that day as far out of my head as it would go. I traveled out of town for a time, worked in other places that rained heavy and stormed hard, and though I got myself indoors quicker than I would have done before the incident I felt nothing like I had in Walpurgis.

I‚Äôd been mistaken, I thought. Must have been. Only Ann biting at her lip and looking at me strange whenever a hard rain got going made me think any different.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù I said, once I‚Äôd had just about enough of this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. It ain‚Äôt gonna happen again.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt might,‚Äù Ann insisted. ‚ÄúPeople who‚Äôve been struck by lightning once are more likely to get struck again. I read it online.‚Äù

Being that Ann read more or less everything online and from questionable sources I paid this no mind.

It‚Äôs as I was putting my coat on that she said, ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt the only one that got hit in that storm, Joe.‚Äù

I looked round at her, brows just about up to my ears.

‚ÄúWell, who else was?‚Äù

‚ÄúFred Meier. My second cousin. You know him.‚Äù

I did. Ann‚Äôs family were of the old German settler stock up in the North side of town. Most still had traces of the accent and some even spoke a little German, mainly the older folks. I figured that‚Äôs where all the superstition in this town came from: old ghost stories and fairy tales from that far country.

‚ÄúFred Meier,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSure, I know him. So how‚Äôd it happen?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe was out hiking with some folks when they got caught out in the bad weather. Weren‚Äôt forecast, so they couldn‚Äôt reschedule or anything. Well, they were heading up some high path when Fred started acting strange, said he was sure something was after him.

‚ÄúNext thing they knew a big old lightning bolt came down and they were all flat on their backs half-stunned, and Fred hit so bad he couldn‚Äôt move all down his left side.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, shit,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs he doing now?‚Äù

Ann shrugged.

‚ÄúGetting his movement back some. He ended up in some hospital out of town because of overcrowding, else we would have seen him, I bet. I ought to visit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou take yourself over there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be glad to see you, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

Ann was clearly hoping I‚Äôd stay home after what she‚Äôd told me, and in hindsight I should have. 

As it was I went to do some work on a roof that‚Äôd had shingles blown off it in the storm; I‚Äôd always been an odd jobs man, and I could repair just about anything I set my hand to. I felt a whole lot better once I was up there on the top of that house being of use to someone. Keeping active keeps the mind clean, and I had a lot of dirt to shake.

But it was while I was up there, sweating and cursing under the sun, that I got that feeling of woodland eyes on me again so strong that I couldn‚Äôt brush it off or ignore it the way I wanted to. For a while I told myself maybe there was a coyote or a wild cat around, watching me from the street, but no matter which way I turned I couldn‚Äôt see a thing.

I sat up on that roof, scared without a cause, starting to blame Ann for putting an idea in my head I couldn‚Äôt seem to shake. Then like some disgruntled animal the first thunder boomed over me, and I was on the ladder and scuttling down it so fast that my boot missed a rung and my heart just about dropped out of my ass.

I held onto either side of the ladder, my loose foot scraping desperately for grip. 

Whatever that storm was had been watching me, and now it had me where I couldn‚Äôt run. A fork of lightning thrashed the rooftop so close that all the hairs on my face singed off with the heat. The force of that nearby blow punched the ladder clean off the wall, and it‚Äôs lucky I didn‚Äôt have too far to jump clear of it before it fell on top of me.

I lay on my back, breathing hard, trying to get myself up and failing each time. It was having that pressure over me that did it, the knowing that the lightning was hostile and aware of me. Though it couldn‚Äôt eat like a bear it could kill me as surely as one: it‚Äôs as I was thinking this that a second strike clapped over my head, and what I felt then was like being hit by a lit firework, a force that stunned me into the black of near death that I‚Äôd seen once before.

I felt an uncanny acceptance come over me, and I waited to die, terror burned out of me into cold. When I came round I was surprised that nobody had run over to check on me, but with the storm still going strong most folks were likely safe indoors.

I stayed where I was, eyes closed, hoping to God the lightning wouldn‚Äôt notice that it hadn‚Äôt killed me.

I probably lay there a good twenty minutes before I dared to get up again, stiff all over with the taste of metal so strong in my mouth that I had to spit. My heart seemed to beat off rhythm, though whether it was the strike that did it or the fear that still had not left me I do not know.

That was the first time in my life I‚Äôve had to leave a job unfinished, though at least I had a solid reason. I thought about lying to Ann about why I‚Äôd had to call it off, but she knew as soon as I walked through the front door what had happened. 

I had burns running down my shoulders like the branches of red trees, or the scratches left by claws.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Ann. ‚ÄúOh, Joe. What are we going to do?‚Äù



*


There were two more incidents with the lightning after that. The first time I was indoors, cooped up in front of the computer looking into some online courses my wife had been on my neck to take so as I wouldn't have to go outside to work so much. I knew she was onto a decent idea, but I've only ever been good with my hands and I couldn't make head nor tail of anything I was looking at.

I guess that's why I didn't notice the clouds building outside my window till the first roll of thunder went off like the sound of vehicles colliding on a wet road. It occurred to me that the sound had always come first in this sinister weather, that this, too, was wrong.

Then the lightning snapped so close to the house that the whole window lit up white, harsh enough that my eyes near burned with it. 

I remember thinking, ""Can't get me in here, can you, you old bastard,"" before it struck again, this time somewhere on the roof.

All the lights in the house blew out with a noise like a shotgun blast, and I felt the shock of it all up my arm from touching the keyboard, knocking me off my chair and against the wall. I sat there cradling the limb, muttering the Lord's prayer and stuttering like hell over it, too. 

All the while that storm went to work out there, and I could swear that it was angry it couldn't do more. Like it could see me, smell me, just couldn't get in; burning out all the electrics was the closest it could get.

""This ain't right, Joe,"" said Ann, shaking next to me in bed later that night. ""How did it get inside? How did it know where you were when‚Äî""

‚ÄúWhen it couldn't see you‚Äù, she meant.

She was starting to think the same way I was.

The last time the lightning got me was a month later, when I'd been cooped up for so long out of work that I'd started going a little stir crazy.  I checked the skies beyond the windows with a paranoid frequency, desperate to go outside but in such a fear of the storm thing killing me that each time I went to my front door I could never bring myself to step foot beyond it. 

It was Ann's birthday coming up that finally pushed me to do it. Sure, I could have ordered her something online, but I couldn't stand gawping at that screen for even one more second. Besides, I'd noticed since the third incident I had sort of a strange effect on electronic devices. Lights flickered, watches stopped working the second they were strapped to my wrist, and speakers started giving off an odd noise like they were picking up interference.

All in all I was jumping at the chance to get myself outdoors and away from everything, only I should have known better. Did know better. The confinement had sent me a little over the edge. I suppose I wasn't thinking straight, and Ann wasn't home to set me right.

I let myself out of the house and set off for the nearest store on foot, telling myself that it was safer than driving, that I could duck for cover if I sensed something coming on.

I hadn't cleared more than a few blocks when I felt a raindrop hit the back of my neck and nearly jumped a mile. Looking up at the sky I saw a black cloud had started pooling like blood in a blue iris, and I recognised at once that it was the same storm that had kept on me since the start.

I felt a sweat starting under my shirt, but all I felt was cold as panic took me in a stranglehold. There was the feeling I was face to face with an animal, each of us waiting to see what the other would do. Out of the corner of my eye I took measure of the nearby buildings, judging how quickly I could get myself inside and wait for the storm to pass.

Before I knew it I was running as fast as my body would let me being that I was forty, and my previous injuries had me feeling a good deal older. I felt a weight over me like something pressed down from within the sky, and it was just as I got myself through the door of a tired looking bar that lightning hit the sidewalk, shattering the windows in a rain of charred glass. 

The bar staff rushed forward to assess the damage, hanging cautiously back as the storm warred in the street beyond.

""Shit,"" a man said to me. ""Are you alright? You nearly got yourself shocked just there.""

""I need a drink,"" is all I could think to say.

I don't recall how I got home. By the time I got in and lay down I was so drunk that I went immediately to sleep. I remember thinking that it was easier that way. That if the lightning came again I wouldn't know.

When Ann found me she sat down on the edge of the bed and started biting at her lips until I thought she'd gnaw right through to the meat.

""I'll go up and see my cousin,"" she told me. ""He's bound to know something, surely. I'll go and see him.""

She said it reluctantly, like it was some difficult thing she'd been working towards for a long time, which I suppose she had. 

I didn't see how it would help any. Surely Fred was just as lost in all this as I was. Still I said nothing, let Ann drive on up the next morning. Let her think it would do some good.

When she came back later that night she had a look on her face I didn't recognise, one I still can't put a name to. All I knew was that something had gone wrong while she'd been visiting. That, or she'd got wind of something she didn't much want to hear.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Fred?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù said Ann, setting her handbag down on the floor. ‚ÄúWell as he can be. Hasn‚Äôt been outside in weeks. My Great Aunt Lina was there with him, visiting from out of town. We got to talking.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Lina the one into all that cosmetology shit?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMeteorology, honey. Weather studies. She says even before her boy got struck and holed up in that hospital she was reading all about it, keeping scrap books of old newspaper clippings and articles she printed off from her computer. Real organised. She showed me everything she‚Äôd put together, said she‚Äôd tried taking it to all sorts of people‚Äî the authorities, psychics, experts in weather phenomenon. Nobody paid her any notice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù I asked, though I knew almost since she‚Äôd started talking where the conversation was leading up to.

‚ÄúThe lightning,‚Äù said Ann. ‚ÄúIt was ‚Äô65 last time it went after people the way it‚Äôs been doing this summer. The autumn of that year there were flash storms just about every week or so. Lightning that just snuck up on you. Caught houses on fire, blew electrics and knocked trees down. All the things you‚Äôd expect, at first. Then it started after people.

There was a little girl, Hannah M√ºller. Lina knew her pretty well, played with her sometimes. She was just twelve years old when the lightning hit her the first time. She was riding her bicycle up and down outside her house when the clouds came in, and next thing anyone knew a bolt of lightning snapped down like an elastic band and struck her clean off the bike.

Her hair and clothes were on fire but she wasn‚Äôt screaming‚Äî the shock, I guess. Her mother ran out to get to her and four more strikes came down, one after the other in a circle, like the storm was pacing around that girl, trying to get at her again. It only touched her the once that time or it would have killed her.

It‚Äôs as the family tried moving Hannah out of state for better medical care that it did. They were loading suitcases into the back of a moving van when the storm came back. Hannah started yelling, tripped over herself trying to get back in the house saying it was chasing her. Right then the lightning hit that little girl three times, stabbing at her till she was dead. Twelve years old and killed on her own doorstep. Can you imagine?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt much want to, but I shook my head and let Ann talk.

‚ÄúHannah wasn‚Äôt the only one that ended up dying that way. There was a lady driving to work that said she felt something strange, like a warning bell going off in her head. She thought maybe she was about to get hit by another car, or somebody was going to run out across the road; it was that kind of feeling. The lightning hit her so fast all she saw was a white light across the windshield before she totalled her car against a fence.

She lost a leg in that crash, and because of the lightning hitting her she couldn‚Äôt use her hands much either. Something to do with the nerves, I guess. The second time she was struck coming out of the hospital‚Äî happened so fast passers-by don‚Äôt reckon she saw it. She died instantly. Her body was charred nearly to dust in how direct it hit.‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking Christ,‚Äù I said.

I got up to make coffee, needing something to do with my hands.

‚ÄúAunt Lina was just a kid at that time,‚Äù said Ann, ‚Äúbut she got curious how come there had been two cases like that so close together. She started her research then and just kept on going, learning all the time. Every thirty to sixty years or so there are incidents with the lightning in this town, and this town only; it never crosses the border, somehow. Aberrant, Aunt Lina calls it. Aberrant lightning‚Äî Lord, that lady has a way with words.‚Äù

Ann took the coffee cup as I handed it to her and blew on it gently as she gathered her thoughts.

‚ÄúEach time it comes there‚Äôs reports people sense it before they see anything, though it‚Äôs never forecast and it never seems like the right weather for it. Then the lightning just keeps coming back and back till the people it hits die, except sometimes if it‚Äôs starved out long enough it'll move off again. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs alive, somehow. There‚Äôs been plenty of folks that think it is.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúWhen it came that first time I thought a lot about wild animals that get aggressive with human beings. Man-eating gators. Bucks that charge at people passing through National Parks because they‚Äôve gotten too comfortable being approached by people, or because we‚Äôve  started moving in on their territory.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt the first one to say that. Lina said the oldest accounts she could find were from the settling families. They were even more superstitious than people are now, and maybe they weren‚Äôt wrong to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did they say?‚Äù

I‚Äôd given up my pretence of not believing by now, embraced what I‚Äôd known in my soul from the first day I‚Äôd encountered that lightning.

‚ÄúThe settlers thought that whatever was causing that lightning wasn‚Äôt the weather at all,‚Äù said Ann. ‚ÄúMore likely some kind of spirit or creature. Hell knows there‚Äôs enough talk around here of that kind of thing. Sure, it looked just like lightning, but it behaved like some angry animal that got woken up or disturbed somehow and attacked whoever it saw first.

Usually it‚Äôd go for two, three, even five people at one time before it settled. There wasn‚Äôt any reasoning with it or chasing it off. You couldn‚Äôt bargain with it, kill or hurt it. You just had to stay out of its way until it left. Or slept, I‚Äôd guess. The settlers had a name for it. ‚ÄòSchwarzb√§r‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlack bear,‚Äù I said.

Ann‚Äôs eyes widened.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you know that? You don‚Äôt speak a lick of German.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt hard to figure out. Besides, that's what came into my head that afternoon you found me in the driveway. Black bear. Hunter lightning.‚Äù

We sat silent a while, watching our coffee steam, not much wanting to drink.

‚ÄúWhat do we do, Joe?‚Äù asked Ann at last.

‚ÄúWell, I guess we‚Äôve got to move,‚Äù I said without much confidence.

‚ÄúHow in God‚Äôs name are we going to afford it? Besides, like I said, it won‚Äôt work. Look what happened to Hannah.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we wait it out,‚Äù I said, exasperated. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the longest the Bear‚Äôs been awake for?‚Äù

At this Ann worked her teeth into the little scar on her lip.

‚ÄúFrom what Lina showed me about a year. There were times people braved stepping out too soon and got hit right away, like the Bear was lying low thinking to catch them.‚Äù

I began to knead my eye sockets with the balls of my fingertips.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôve got to hide in here and hope I get the timing right? How are we supposed to live when I can‚Äôt go to work?‚Äù

Ann laid her hand on mine and squeezed it lightly.

‚ÄúJoe, it‚Äôs either this or you don‚Äôt live at all. I don‚Äôt see that we have a choice.‚Äù

Just then thunder tore over the top of the house, and I knew that Ann was right. This lightning means to kill me, and if it reaches me it will.",2,1743443872.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I've been having this issue for about 2-3 years now. The following will happen 1-2 times day, and sometimes 5-6 times a day all within a 1 hour period. 

While I know I still have room to grow, learn, and be humbled about; I have 15 years combined of engineering work in IT, help desk, and Information Security. and I still cannot fix this issue. I feel at a loss. Even my IT Team (whom one of them I've worked with for my nearly my entire career, and is in my eyes a Master.) also cannot fix this issue. 

  
ALL of the following occurs when I have issues:  

* Cannot copy and paste with CMD+C/CMD-V, or rather copy and paste anything new. Whatever was previously on my clipboard will paste instead of whatever I newly copy and paste with. if I right click and do copy, and then right click and do paste, it works.
* Cannot CMD+R (refresh) the page. (seems like keyboard shortcuts overall just don't work.)
* Clicking requires double click or triple click. (single click requires double click, double click requires a triple click)
* Collapsed menus on most websites will immediately collapse back, and not be usable.
* YouTube seeking is nearly impossible, as I have to (double)click to review the timeline, and then fight with triple clicks to seek.

Here's what I've already tried:

* Removing all extensions
* Clearing cache and cookies
* Completely wiping the MacBook and starting fresh, and only signing into work chrome user, and then web browsing.
* Disabled/Enabled GPU acceleration
* ""Wiping"" or complete resetting chrome. 
* Tried Different hardware, I swapped from an M1 MBP 16"" to an M2 Max MBP 16"".

Some notes I have:

* Computer is managed by my IT team using Jamf. Computer can be enrolled in a prestige program to enroll, or use user-initiated enrollment and it still has the issue.
* Chrome has enforced settings and enforced 3-4 extensions. No other user is experiencing the issues I have.

* I think it's related to Managed Chrome, or Jamf somehow, but I also think it might not be? I don't know what could possibly be different from my device(s) compared to other users of the same hardware and enforcement from IT.
* I've pulled up task manager for Chrome, and seeing some tabs that have high CPU usage. When I close those tabs, it's a 50/50 chance that closing it will instantly fix the problem and my symptoms vanish.
* I'm going to try migrating to Safari for a week and see if it helps. If it doesn't, then I know it's Jamf or something else enforced on my device. 

The only solution I've found is a temporary one, and that requires a complete force-close of chrome. 

Please help. 2-3 years of this, and I'm LOSING MY GODDAMN MIND. I'll buy someone a case of Beer/Wine/Tea/Coffee or donate to your charity of choice $35 if you can fix this for me. (Results must be repeatable for at least a week.)

I have been on 15mg IR adderall for about a little over a year and have lost a significant amount of weight, with this being said, I didn‚Äôt want to lose the weight and have a hard time putting it back on. I have been giving myself adderall breaks during the weekends when school isn‚Äôt crazy and some days during the work week about 2-3 days max. The two side effects I do not like are the unintentional weight loss and the fatigue when I don‚Äôt take the medication. 

My main question is, those who take breaks, so you‚Äôre able to give your body a break, eat and not build a tolerance, how do you handle to fatigue? It is horrible! I feel like someone put a weighted blanket on me or like I unknowingly taken a Benadryl and have to fight throughout the day to gain any energy. It‚Äôs not enough to the point of I can lay down and go to sleep, it‚Äôs more like I just have no energy or motivation to do anything and need multiple cups of coffee just to function and that barely takes the edge off. 

I read this was a normal side effect but how long does this last? I end up taking my meds again around the 3rd day because it has made me so unproductive and like something is wrong with me. I hate that I feel like I am reliant on them due to fatigue.  ",1,1743443667.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1jo9fv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1jo9fv3/bank_statement_certified_translation_tip/,Bank statement certified translation tip,"**These can be the most costly documents to translate**, especially if, like me, you have a thousand transactions from coffee runs to daily Amazon purchases.

**Quick tip**: Before translating your bank statement, ask your bank if they can provide it in English. Some do. I believe HSBC offers this option.

**Here‚Äôs what most people don‚Äôt know**:

UKVI does not require a complete translation of your bank statement or other documents. So if you‚Äôre using a translator who charges per word, removing unnecessary parts can save you a lot.

**Other documents this is useful for:**

\- **Pay slips**: You can get away with removing all the different taxes. They mainly want to know how much you earn.

\- **Tenancy agreement**: Only translate the first and last page. They don‚Äôt care about clauses on damages or unpaid rent.

**Things you can remove from your bank statement**

*(In the image as an example, I put in green what you can remove without any issue, in yellow what you can consider removing depending on your circumstances, and red what you should absolutely not remove):*

https://preview.redd.it/t2zpqierc2se1.jpg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b180a33161a90b992a4d785cd8a97c8952c64d0c

**Definitely remove:**

* Advertising or promotional text from your bank
* Legal disclaimers (often in the footer)
* Your address (unless it's not in the Roman or Latin alphabet)

**Up to you:**

* Bank assistant contact details
* Unimportant transactions like coffee shops or grocery runs *(I‚Äôd keep salary payments, other income, and major outgoings like rent or mortgage, especially if you‚Äôre trying to show ties to your home country)*

**Keep 100%:**

* Dates
* Document title (e.g. ""Bank Statement"")
* Balance
* Table headers (like ""Transaction date"", ""Amount"", etc.)

**Now, the problem:**

Most online certified translation services quote per page, but what they actually do is charge for every 250 words. So if one page has 300 words, that gets rounded up to two pages. If you have 550 words on one page, that might be charged as three.

**So how do you avoid this?**

1. **Use a freelance translato**r

You can find some on sites like \[Proz.com\](https://www.proz.com) or \[TranslatorsCafe.com\](https://www.translatorscafe.com)

* Let them know exactly which parts not to translate
* Ask them to provide a certification that says:
* It is a ""true and accurate translation of the original document""
* The date of the translation
* Their full name and contact details
* If they can add qualifications or membership in translation bodies, even better

2. **Try this online service**

\[YouTube video\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdYQ--VW5zA&t=67s)

It‚Äôs pretty straightforward and lets you remove content before translating. Great if you want to save money.

Hope this helps someone.

**Disclaimer:** This is for UKVI. If you need a certified translation for something else, rules might be different (e.g. solicitors when buying a property, money laundering checks, etc.)",2,1743443647.0,ukvisa,0,1.0,False

\----------------------------------  
  
Late Sunday Night ‚Äì The Apartment

The key turned stiffly in the lock. When David pushed open the door, the smell of stale takeout and spilled wine hit him like a wall. The living room was a disaster‚Äîcrumpled snack bags piled on the coffee table, a pizza box left open with congealed cheese clinging to the cardboard, and an overturned glass staining the rug with a dark, sugary ring.

Emma‚Äôs shoes lay discarded in the middle of the floor, one on its side as if kicked off in a hurry. Her hoodie‚Äîhis¬†hoodie‚Äîwas draped over the back of the couch, sleeves crusted with what looked like dried ketchup.

David stood frozen in the doorway, his body heavy with exhaustion. His shift at the coffee bar had left his hands raw, his back aching, and now this.

""Unbelievable,""¬†he muttered under his breath.

But he didn‚Äôt have the energy to be angry. Instead, he just bent down, picked up the trash, and started cleaning.

By the time he finished, it was well past midnight. His vision blurred with fatigue as he dragged himself toward his bedroom, desperate for even a few hours of sleep before class the next morning.

But when he pushed open the door, he froze.

His closet‚Äîthe one Emma had claimed for her overflow clothes‚Äîstood wide open, half-empty hangers dangling uselessly. And on his bed, in a careless heap, lay a tangle of her things: silky blouses, a pair of jeans, a lacy black bra tossed on top like an afterthought.

David‚Äôs breath caught.

He didn‚Äôt know what to do.

Move them? What if Emma got mad? What if she‚Äôd left them there on purpose?

But the bed was¬†his. The only space in this apartment that was supposed to be just his.

His hands hovered over the clothes, hesitating. He could almost hear Emma‚Äôs voice in his head‚Äî""Ugh, David, don‚Äôt touch my stuff!""‚Äîeven though she was the one who‚Äôd invaded his room in the first place.

In the end, he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to risk it.

With a quiet sigh, he turned away, pulling a thin blanket from the shelf‚Äîthe one he used when Emma stole all the others. He didn‚Äôt even bother changing out of his work clothes.

The couch in the living room was too short, the cushions lumpy from years of use. He curled up awkwardly, the blanket barely covering him, his legs dangling over the armrest.

It wasn‚Äôt comfortable. But exhaustion won out. Within minutes, he was asleep.

\---

Emma stretched lazily as she stepped out of her bedroom, the morning light casting a warm glow over the spotless living room. She inhaled deeply, pleased with the crisp, clean scent‚Äîas it should be every morning, she thought.¬†David better keep it this way.

She hummed to herself as she grabbed a box of cereal from the cupboard, pouring it carelessly into a bowl. Milk sloshed over the edge as she added it, pooling on the counter. She barely glanced at the mess before setting the carton down‚Äînot¬†in the fridge‚Äîand taking her first bite.

""Mmm, perfect,""¬†she murmured, crunching happily.

Bowl in hand, she turned toward the couch‚Äîonly to stop short.

David was still there, curled awkwardly under his thin blanket, his breathing deep and slow. For a fleeting moment, a pang of something like sympathy flickered through her.¬†He must be exhausted.

But then her eyes narrowed.

Her¬†spot on the couch‚Äîthe center, where she always sat‚Äîwas blocked by his body. And she¬†needed¬†to watch her morning show.

The sympathy evaporated.

Without hesitation, she strode over and let herself drop‚Äîhard‚Äîonto David‚Äôs stomach.

""OOF‚Äî!""

David jolted awake, gasping for air, his eyes flying open in shock. Emma didn‚Äôt even flinch. She just adjusted herself comfortably, balancing her cereal bowl on her lap as she grabbed the remote.

""Emma‚Äî""¬†David wheezed,¬†""you‚Äôre‚Äîyou‚Äôre sitting on me‚Äî""

She ignored him, flipping through channels until she found her show. The opening jingle blared through the speakers.

David shifted slightly, wincing.¬†""You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ kind of heavy‚Äî""

""What did you just say?""¬†Emma snapped, twisting to glare at him. Her voice was ice.

David froze.

""If you didn‚Äôt take up so much space, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem,""¬†she said sharply, settling back down with a deliberate wiggle‚Äîjust enough to make his ribs protest.¬†""Now¬†shut up. I‚Äôm watching . MY. SHOW.""

David clenched his jaw but stayed silent, his breath coming in shallow bursts under her weight.

For a while, the only sounds were the TV and Emma‚Äôs occasional crunching. Then‚Äî

""Emma, I can‚Äôt‚Äî""

""Ugh!¬†Enough!""

In one swift motion, she yanked off her sock, balled it up, and shoved it into his mouth.

""There,""¬†she said sweetly, patting his cheek.¬†""Now you‚Äôll¬†finally¬†be quiet.""

She turned back to the TV, perfectly at ease, as David lay there‚Äîtrapped, humiliated, and utterly powerless.

David made a small, involuntary noise as Emma shifted her weight, the sock still stuffed in his mouth. Her icy glare immediately snapped toward him, and he froze‚Äîuntil her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

In an instant, her expression transformed. Her eyes lit up, her lips curling into a delighted smile as she grabbed her phone.

""Oh! It's John!""¬†she squealed, pausing her show without hesitation.

David watched as her fingers flew across the screen, her face glowing with excitement. Then, suddenly, she turned to him, her eyes sparkling.

""David! Guess what? John just invited me over on Thursday! He says he has a¬†surprise¬†for me!""¬†She clapped her hands together, bouncing slightly in her seat‚Äîwhich, for David, meant another sharp jolt to his already protesting ribs.

""I¬†wonder¬†what he's planning...""¬†she mused, tapping her chin.¬†""Maybe candles? Wine? Oh! Maybe he cooked something special!""

David's stomach twisted.¬†If only she knew.

Emma twirled a strand of hair around her finger, lost in thought.¬†""I should wear something¬†really¬†nice... Maybe we need to go shopping again, David. New lingerie, maybe?""¬†She winked at him.¬†""I want to surprise John¬†my¬†way too.""

Her gaze drifted back to him, and she patted his chest absently.¬†""Oh, but this means¬†you'll¬†have the whole evening to yourself on Thursday! Lucky you! You can finally catch up on all that studying you‚Äôve been whining about.""

David‚Äôs jaw tensed around the sock.¬†If she only knew.

""Of course,""¬†Emma continued cheerfully,¬†""this means you‚Äôll have to help me¬†extra¬†the rest of the week. Laundry, cleaning, maybe even a foot massage...""¬†She wiggled her toes pointedly.

She shifted again, her movements sending another wave of discomfort through David‚Äôs cramped body. But Emma didn‚Äôt notice‚Äîor care. She was too busy daydreaming, her excitement making her practically vibrate where she sat.

""John is¬†so¬†thoughtful,""¬†she sighed, scrolling through his messages again.¬†""I bet he‚Äôs planned something¬†amazing...""

David closed his eyes, the sock still silencing him, the weight of Thursday‚Äîand the lie‚Äîpressing down on him just as heavily as Emma herself.

Just as Emma stood up to set her cereal bowl on the coffee table, her phone rang. Without a second thought, she dropped back down‚Äîdirectly onto David's ribs‚Äîanswering the call with a cheerful,¬†""Charlotte! Perfect timing!""

David's eyes widened in silent agony, his breath hitching as her full weight slammed back into him. He stared up at her pleadingly, but Emma just smirked, adjusting herself comfortably as she chatted away, completely ignoring his discomfort.

""You'll¬†never¬†guess what!""¬†Emma gushed, twirling a strand of hair around her finger.¬†""John just messaged me‚Äîhe's planning a¬†whole surprise dinner¬†for me on Thursday! Candles, wine, the works!""

Charlotte's voice crackled through the speaker, loud enough for David to hear.¬†""Wow,¬†that's¬†a man who knows how to treat a woman. Unlike¬†some people.""

Emma laughed, glancing down at David with mock sympathy.¬†""Oh, come on, David tries his best. He can cook and set the mood, sure... but¬†romance?¬†Be intimate with me? That‚Äôs just not in his skillset.""

They both burst into laughter. David clenched his fists, the sock in his mouth suddenly feeling even more suffocating.

""Anyway,""¬†Emma continued,¬†""you should come over tonight! I‚Äôve got nothing planned, and since¬†David¬†and I¬†agreed¬†he‚Äôd be extra helpful this week‚Äî""

David‚Äôs eyes flicked to hers.¬†Agreed?

""‚ÄîI‚Äôll have plenty of free time before Thursday!""

Charlotte hesitated.¬†""Is David gonna be there tonight?""

""Obviously,""¬†Emma said, rolling her eyes.¬†""Who else is gonna refill our drinks?""

Charlotte groaned.¬†""Ugh, I¬†hate¬†when he interrupts us. Or talks. Or...¬†exists¬†near me.""

Emma grinned, tapping the sock still stuffed in David‚Äôs mouth.¬†""Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got it handled. He‚Äôs¬†very¬†quiet right now.""

Charlotte‚Äôs laughter screeched through the phone.¬†""Oh my god,¬†yes! I‚Äôll bring something¬†extra¬†for him tonight, then. Guaranteed silence!""

Emma winked at David, her voice dripping with amusement.¬†""Perfect. See you tonight!""

She hung up, finally pulling the sock from his mouth‚Äîonly to drape it over his forehead instead.¬†""You‚Äôre¬†so¬†lucky Charlotte‚Äôs coming. She always has the¬†best¬†ideas.""

David swallowed hard, his throat dry.¬†""Emma, I‚Äî""

""Ah-ah!""¬†She pressed a finger to his lips.¬†""Save your energy. You‚Äôll need it tonight.""

With that, she stood up‚Äîfinally‚Äîleaving David gasping on the couch, the weight of the week (and Charlotte‚Äôs impending ""solution"") crushing him more than Emma ever could.

\---  
David dragged himself through the front door, his shoulders slumped under the weight of his backpack. The school day had been a blur‚Äîlectures he couldn‚Äôt focus on, notes he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to finish. His eyelids felt like lead, his thoughts sluggish.¬†Maybe I should just... stop for this year.¬†The idea lingered, heavy but tempting.¬†Come back fresh next term.

Emma was sprawled across the couch, scrolling through her phone, her legs draped over the armrest. She didn‚Äôt look up as he shuffled past.

""I‚Äôll make dinner,""¬†he muttered, already heading for the kitchen. Emma hummed absently in response.

By the time the food was ready‚Äîpasta with a simple tomato sauce, the quickest thing he could manage‚ÄîDavid‚Äôs hands were trembling slightly from exhaustion. He set the plates on the table, calling out softly,¬†""Emma? It‚Äôs ready.""

She sauntered over, dropping into her chair with a sigh, as if the effort of moving had been a great inconvenience. David sat across from her, pushing the food around his plate. The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable, until he finally cleared his throat.

""I‚Äôve been... thinking,""¬†he started, his voice hesitant.¬†""About school.""

Emma glanced up, her eyebrows raised.¬†""Oh?""

""I don‚Äôt know if I can keep up like this,""¬†he admitted, staring down at his plate.¬†""I‚Äôm so tired all the time, and I‚Äôm falling behind. I thought maybe... maybe I should take a break. Just for this year. Start again next term when I‚Äôm not so... stretched thin.""

For a moment, Emma just studied him. Then, to his surprise, her expression softened. She leaned forward slightly, her voice uncharacteristically gentle.

""David, that‚Äôs... actually not a bad idea.""

He blinked, caught off guard.¬†""It‚Äôs not?""

""No,""¬†she said, tilting her head.¬†""I mean, think about it. You‚Äôre¬†always¬†stressed about schoolwork, and then you‚Äôre too exhausted to help me properly. If you weren‚Äôt in classes, you‚Äôd have¬†so¬†much more time.""¬†She smiled, almost sweetly.¬†""It would be easier for¬†both¬†of us.""

David stared at her. For a fleeting second, it felt like old times‚Äîlike she was really listening, like she¬†cared. His chest tightened with something dangerously close to hope.

""You... you really think so?""

Emma nodded, reaching across the table to pat his hand.¬†""Of course. I just want what‚Äôs best for you.""

The words should have warmed him. But something in her tone‚Äîthe way her smile didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes‚Äîmade his stomach twist.

Before he could respond, the doorbell rang.

Emma‚Äôs face lit up.¬†""Oh! That‚Äôll be Charlotte!""¬†She waved toward the door.¬†""Go let her in.""

David pushed back his chair, his legs unsteady as he crossed the room. ¬†

The door swung open to reveal Charlotte standing in the hallway, her smirk already in place. She carried a large linen sack slung over one shoulder, bulging with delicate fabrics.

""Well, well,""¬†she purred, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation.¬†""If it isn‚Äôt the¬†help.""

""Hope you've got soft hands,¬†Wimp,""¬†she purred, shoving past him into the apartment.¬†""Because you'll be putting them to good use tonight.""¬†She dropped the sack onto the floor with a thump, and through the loosely tied opening, David caught glimpses of lace, silk, and satin‚Äîall¬†of it unmistakably intimate.

Emma clapped her hands together, delighted.¬†""Oh,¬†perfect! You can wash these while Charlotte and I catch up!""

David's stomach dropped.

But before he could react, Charlotte thrust a meal kit box into his chest.¬†""Make this first. I'm¬†starving.""¬†She snapped her fingers.¬†""And hurry up.""

David took the box wordlessly, retreating to the kitchen like a condemned man. As he chopped vegetables and stirred sauces, the women's laughter floated in from the dining table‚Äîsharp, bright, and utterly oblivious to his presence.

""So,""¬†Emma said between sips of wine,¬†""David actually has a little¬†gift¬†for you too!""

Charlotte's eyebrows shot up.¬†""Oh? Do tell.""

David's hands stilled on the knife. He knew what was coming.

""Go on,""¬†Emma called to him, her voice sweet but firm.¬†""Get it.""

Setting the knife down, David wiped his hands on his apron and walked to the closet. He pulled out the elegantly wrapped perfume box. Charlotte snatched it from his hands before he could even fully extend his arm.¬†""Let's hope it's not some cheap drugstore crap,""¬†she muttered, already tearing at the packaging.

""Oh, don't worry,""¬†Emma said airily.¬†""I¬†picked¬†it for you.""

Charlotte's face lit up.¬†""Oh! Well in¬†that¬†case‚Äî""¬†She beamed at Emma.¬†""Thank you, darling!""

Not a glance at David. Not a word.

The food was ready by then‚Äîsome gourmet pasta dish that Charlotte had demanded‚Äîand David served it to her with careful hands. As he set the plate down, he made the mistake of speaking.

""Is there anything else you‚Äî""

""Oh my¬†god,""¬†Charlotte groaned, rolling her eyes dramatically. She turned to Emma.¬†""Did no one ever teach him to¬†shut up?""

Emma giggled, swirling her wine.¬†""Last time I stuffed my sock in his mouth. Worked¬†wonders.""

Charlotte's eyes gleamed.¬†""I've got something¬†better.""

Before David could react, she sprang up and marched to her linen sack. With a flourish, she pulled out a scrap of black lace‚Äîa thong, barely there, the edges trimmed with delicate bows.

""Open up,""¬†she commanded, advancing on him.

David's throat went dry.

""Charlotte, I don't‚Äî""

""I said¬†open.""

Charlotte shoved the lace into his mouth, her fingers pressing insistently until the fabric filled every inch of space. The taste‚Äîfaintly floral, with something unmistakably¬†human¬†beneath it‚Äîmade his eyes water.

Emma raised her glass in a toast.¬†""To a¬†peaceful¬†evening!""

Their laughter followed David as he turned back to the kitchen, the lace clinging to his tongue, the sack of delicates waiting like a taunt.

The lace thong still filled David's mouth, its bitter taste clinging to his tongue as Emma clinked her wine glass excitedly against Charlotte's.

""Oh! I have¬†even better¬†news!""¬†Emma announced, her eyes sparkling.¬†""David's decided to¬†quit school! Isn't that perfect?

Charlotte's grin turned razor-sharp.¬†""Ohhh, I¬†do¬†hope he can meet my standards,""¬†she purred, tapping a manicured nail against her chin.¬†""They're¬†very¬†high.""

David's stomach twisted. He tried to mumble around the fabric‚ÄîIt's just a break, not forever‚Äîbut the words dissolved into incoherent noise.

Emma giggled.¬†""Oh, listen! He's trying to say you're¬†third¬†in line, Charlotte. After me and John, of course.""

Charlotte's smile vanished.

She stood so fast her chair screeched, stalking toward David until her face was inches from his.¬†""Excuse me?¬†Third? You can't put all three of us in¬†first¬†place, you pathetic little wimp?""

David froze.

""Answer me when I'm talking to you!""¬†Charlotte snapped, and before he could react‚ÄîSMACK. Her palm cracked across his cheek, the sound echoing through the apartment.

David's head jerked to the side, his skin burning. Slowly, he nodded.

Charlotte exhaled, satisfied.¬†""Good answer, wimp.""¬†She turned back to Emma, smug.¬†""See? Problem solved. We're¬†all¬†first now.""

But Emma just smirked, swirling her wine.¬†""Oh, Charlotte. Let's be real‚ÄîI'll¬†always¬†have a special place in David's heart. He's¬†mine¬†first. 24/7.""

""Except Thursday night,""¬†Charlotte shot back.

Emma rolled her eyes.¬†""Ugh,¬†yes. That stupid schoolwork‚Äî""

""Wait.""¬†Charlotte's eyes lit up.¬†""But if he's¬†quitting¬†school... why would he need Thursday night?""¬†She clapped her hands.¬†""Perfect! I'll give him some¬†proper¬†tasks then. Make sure he's not wasting his newfound free time.""

David's blood ran cold.¬†Thursday‚Äîthe dinner. John's surprise.¬†His pulse pounded in his ears, but the thong silenced any protest.

Emma waved a hand.¬†""Of course! Honestly, he should be¬†grateful¬†you're giving him something useful to do. Right,¬†David?""

The weight of their stares pressed down on him. He nodded.

One day I felt drugged going to work and coming home. It was mostly while driving but felt a bit unsteady at periods at work. The next day I tilted my head back and had full blown vertigo   the next day a doctor confirmed vertigo. It was on and off for 4 days. 

I've been to Ear Nose and Throat, a vestibular therapist, multiple doctors. 

About a week after the vertigo subsided I started feeling....it's hard to describe. It feels like I'm drugged but I can't compare it to anything I've ever taken. Driving makes it soooo much worse. Again, I've missed work because I can't drive. 

I've had anxiety my whole life but it's never been like this. It's never kept me from driving. This morning I felt fine and started reading about CBD and anxiety and that hot fluterry wave comes over me just reading about it. 

I have a small business and no employees. I'm terrified of losing everything. 

I've tried drugs before. I was very reluctant. Lexapro sent me to urgent care. I legitimately believed I wad having a heart attack   I'm not a hypochondriac. I don't like doctors. 

L-theanine 100mg made everything so much worse for 3 hours. It was miserable. 

I tried 20mg CBD this morning. It seemed to help a little but I haven't drove yet. As long as I'm moving I'm mostly OK. Once I stop, sit down it's a little horrible. 

I gave up coffee this morning. Every supplement I look into interacts with birth control (I'm married) or you can't take it with low blood pressure. 

I'm at a loss. My life and freedom are being taken from me. I am 44 years old, female. Have an appointment tomorrow and gonna see if I can get my hormone levels checked. 

I haven't been especially stressed out. This all came out of no where with no explanation. Right now I'm just sitting here, typing and there's a wavy dark cloud of anxiety all over me. 

I don't want to feel this way. I don't know why I'm feeling this way. I need to drive!

If anyone has felt this, I'm open to advice. ",3,1743443294.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

Lord, what I'm seeing is so clear and yet so confusing. That is, to confuse is clearly the point, and it's working. 

I haven't been home in months. I'm absorbed entirely in my work, in my own little world, as the cracks continue to show around me. Now, the cracks run red with blood. 

I see the blood everywhere I go. In the apathy. I work among the apathetic. It's not that they don't care, it's that their mother is dying of cancer, their brother is getting evicted, they need to adopt some family to save them from other family. I don't blame them for not having the time or energy to act. 

What have I done? They spirited Mahmoud away to Louisiana, here legally. The next steps are clear. They'll find a way to revoke citizenship, maybe not this month or the next but eventually. 

What have I done to stop it? every day I try everything I can think to do, in my own little world. It's amounted to nothing. Must continue anyway. 

The bombs. How many we make, how many we export. The Department of Education, gone, the bomb factories remain open thats the future they want, that they're building. 

More Students, snatched. Someone said that ""There's an Anne Frank in some attic right now, in New York or New Jersey."" How many families snatched already? 

They opened a private concentration camp in El-Salvador. People from all over the world getting shipped there. Vandalizing cars might get you sent there. No one really did anything about it. 

Anne Frank, up in that attic. watching the world walk by outside the window, I watch it outside mine. I watch a homeless woman, slouched over herself. She hast moved for 10 minutes, though she remains on her feet. Collapsed yet standing. She's america made manifest. Every 20 I give her bites further into me now. Even trying to help begets pain. 

I need to finish my CV. Working on my CV in this world is the most schizophrenic thing I've ever done. I cant focus, I'm 3 cups deep of instant coffee easily 80mg of caffeine per cup. The news keeps working its way back into my mind. 

I need to finish this CV, so I can keep pushing. Pushing my way through the streets the agents abduct people from. To keep a roof over my head; is the place I'm moving made open by stealing people away? Then, the whole country is as such. 

The blood. I see it everywhere. I finally got a girlfriend, after 5 years alone. To spend time with her eases every pain in my body. The journey down douses me in blood. The homeless, more each time. The bombs, more each time. For some time, my body no longer aches. 

Social Security, the thing keeping my grandmother housed? Under attack. Medicaid, for my mother? under attack. My medication? Unavailable. 

What even is it to enjoy these little moments, how valuable is it, compared to he lives blown to pieces by American bombs, my bombs? Even joy causes pain.

This CV has been staring at me for 3 days. Today is the day I finish. Might be able to enjoy a few days more, get a better job. Might be me, slouched over myself on the corner. Might be me, getting deported one day.  Might be my blood on every wall. Might enjoy just one more weekend.",6,1743443196.0,collapse,0,1.0,False

I am also aiming to do walk 8,000-10,000 steps daily. Occasionally strength train and fast 24 hours once a week. The reason I advise to walk instead of run is because for cardio, at a lower heart rate you burn fat. At a high heart rate you burn carbs.

Have been having strange pains in the left side of my chest recently. These are sometimes dull, lasting between around 30 minutes to an hour, and sometimes sudden but lasting only a few minutes. Have these almost daily (sometimes twice daily). It isn't severe pain. I can still function and do general tasks - - but it nevertheless feels uncomfortable; almost tight (but I never have any difficulty breathing). Occasionally this pain is accompanied by a throbbing pain on the right side of the back of my throat (does not feel like a sore throat does - but more like that feeling you get when you swallow something dry without washing it down). I've going to book an appointment w a GP but it won't be until next week as I only just registered with the practice and it takes around 5 days to process my application (United Kingdom based). Not sure what this could be. I've found that my symptoms are similar to Angina and etc (but I don't think its that bad). I've put off getting checked up for about a month since these pains started and they havent eased up (got a little worse), but have had no extreme or real bad pain so far. Its more uncomfortable than painful. Could this be Angina? I drink around 2 coffees and a chai latte every day. I also eat a lot of sushi: lunch and dinner (monday to friday). I exercise twice a week in the gym and haven't put on any weight courtesy of walking around 2hrs every day on top of that and working a fair bit. Should I stop drinking so many hot drinks and eat less sushi? Could this be playing into it? Should I go to the ER? I would rather not go unless its an emergency and this doesn't feel like one yet but I would also not want to randomly drop dead. 

I don't have any existing medical conditions. 

Am not taking any current medication. 

I am 100% sober and have never smoked (but have inhaled a lot passively and a fair bit of rock dust) - never used drugs.

So I made a very difficult decision and quit nursing.

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm in school pursuing accounting (something I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd enjoy) but me and my family got hit with financial trouble. Our landlady moved us out and we‚Äôre now living in a house that‚Äôs $1000 more expensive than our old house and both my parents aren‚Äôt employed (my dad has developed a tumor on top of that) but they pick the odd job here and there and it‚Äôs stressing me out. My problem is I only worked as a nurse for 6 months. There was a time where I applied for so many positions and didn‚Äôt even get an interview so I feel like I doomed my career by not doing a year.

That being said, I was hoping to just remove that work experience and applying for a residency at another hospital (one i interned at before i became an RN) but at the same time I‚Äôm scared. My first experience was borderline traumatic. But I can‚Äôt sit here serving coffee at a cafe, making sorry income, studying accounting when me and my parents are in rough shape.

I have been brewing coffee for a few months only, so I am definitely not an experienced espresso master.

I have been trying to get shots from 17 or 18 gram doses of coffee, but they simply taste way too acidic. I can pull relatively good tasting shots from 11 or 12 grams, but the end result is 25ish grams and the water also flows through relatively fast: in around 16 to 20 seconds. I buy coffee beans from different small, independent roasters, mostly light roasted ones with fruity notes. These would regularly come with recommendations to pull from 18 or even 20 grams to get 40 grams out in 30 seconds, but I cannot match these parameters, and therefore I feel like I am not getting the best out of these expensive coffee beans. I am also having a suspicion that I would get better tastes, if I could pull more according to the recommendations.

Some more info: I am brewing with a Delonghi Dedica 685 with a bottomless portafilter and my grinder is a Kingrinder P2. The grind is the finest I can go so that the Dedica is still able to push the water through. If I go finer, it will just not push the water through, and spins the portafilter out creating a mess in the kitchen instead of good espresso.

Things with my girlfriend took a weird turn since two weekends ago. The weekend prior to that weekend she met someone at a party we were at. I saw the way he looked at her and saw  ""the look"" a man can give a woman. But I was fine with that, afterall looking is allowed, you know? 

So she was talking about him a lot and I brought up that I noticed that look, asked her if she noticed that look aswell. She told me not to worry, too young and not her type blabla. I believed her because why would I not.

So two weekends ago she went to a party I couldnt attend because I had to work. So she told me she would go by car with 2 guys. One of the guys being that guy that gave her that look. Felt a bit weird but I was still ok with it because I trusted her.

Didnt hear from her basically all day, up until the point she responded and we made an appointment to come and pick her up after the party ended. 

Texted her at 22:30 to lmk when where and what time. The party ended at 23:00. 

Didnt hear anything until 01:00, she texted me that they were on the way and in a different city to drop someone off and would go on the way to where I was supposed to pick her up and that she would text me when she gets there.

02:00 came around and no text, I started to get agitated, since I had to work the next day. 03:00 now getting worried because idk if something happend or what happend. Texting and calls go through but no answer whatsoever.

04:00.. 05:00.. Worried sick by now untill around 0530 she opens a snapchat and played it twice. So I get a notification expecting her to finally respond. Still nothing.

However snapchat did update her location so I could see where she was..  So I went from agitated to worried and kinda suspicious. Texted her again to please text back and let her know that I was worried sick and that I would swing by around 08:00 to check of shes ok since she didnt respond.

Ofcourse no response, so I went there and read the nameplate at the door. Turns out the guy that gave her that look lives there. The dad of that guy opened the door, I explained and he let me in. He sent for his wife to wake her up. After which I got a text with ""what are you doing here?"". Told her to come down so we could talk. Took her 15 min. Had a small talk, she still being half drunk or something but atleast she was fine I guess.. Asked her if she would come with me back home, she wouldnt because she still had to do something work related for the other guy (not the one that gave her te look) so she had to stay. Bit weird since she didnt have her laptop with her to do that..

So I left, no sorry no nothing, still being mind fucked about wtf is going on, tried sleeping at home but couldnt and went to work. At work I had a panic Attack for the first time in my life. Never experienced something so scary. Got send home.

Around 20:00 I asked her if she was even coming home at all since she didnt respond and still didnt come home and offered to pick her up. She said that was ok but noticed in the way she said it that she was not happy to.

So I picked her up, a total fucking switch in her behavior towards me in comparison to the week/months before. No Kiss. No hug. Almost no talking. Just very emotionally distanced.

We came home and I told her we could maybe better talk tomorrow since I didn't feel good at all with everything that was going on with me that day, the situation and her being awake a long time. She agreed.

In bed still no cuddle, no touch, no goodnight nothing. Had another panic attack while in bed, she just stayed there in bed when I went out of bed, not really caring and no help whatsoever. 

Morning came around and had a small talk but she was avoiding everything in the conversation. Didnt want to talk about anything basically and told me she had to proces things. Which was weird because communicstion was truly on point up untill now.. 

Went to work, got another panic Attack in the evening and got send home again, for 2 weeks this time. Because of this they are - i think - planning to cancel my new job position (was on trial) since they put in a meeting with my new manager, old manager and me on next monday. Which will mean that I will probably be losing my job.

Came home, told her what happened. Didnt ask me if I was fine or if she could do anything. Wanted a hug, didnt get it. Calmed down a bit and wanted to make plans for the next day, doing some groceries etc.

She told me that she couldnt come because she had to do something work related. This time for the guy that did give her that look. And that she also wouldnt eat at home since she wouldnt be back until 22:00 because she had a appointment with another friend. To say I was suspicious at this moment is a understatement but I let it go because I couldnt prove anything and still wanted to truly just trust her. Rest of the evening she was still cold and distanced.

Next morning I went to the doctor for those panic attacks and send a snapchat of the waiting room, the friend she was supposed to meet in the evening sent me a message and asked what was up. Had a small convo with him. He told me he was at school and that it was boring so I told him yeah but atleast you can look forward to chill with her tonight. He didnt know anything and wasn't even available that evening. Sooo shes lying about her whereabouts. 

Went home and acted like I didn't know anything was wrong. I woke her up and made her coffee like everything was fine and she left around 14:00 to go to that guy. She told me that she would be back around 22:00. Turned off her location when she left. Got a text at 21:30 that she suddenly had to go to a different friend and that she had to go there because that friend broke up with her bf. I was like ok goodluck and update me when you can. Sensing the bs since she said the friend that wasn't able to chill that evening had dropped her off. 

One hour later she text me again asked me if it was ok if she stayed at that friends house since her ex was supposed to pick up some stuff. Asked her what time that would happen and if I should pick her up after. She told me she wanted to stay there. Told her that I didn't really appreciate that since I had something important to discuss (already told her that halfway through the day) and asked her to come home. After a bit of going back and forth her last response was 23:00 ""I guess I have to"". 

I havent heard from her since that last text. Now what you don't know yet is that she has been living with me for the past 3 weeks because her mom kicked her out. She called me crying asking me to let her stay at my house. Ofcourse the answer was yes, pick up your stuff, collect my key and I will see you when I come home. Everything between us was going fine after all and did go fine for the time being, untill that weekend. The friday before the party she still told me she loved me and that I was hers and she was mine. I honestly don't understand her switch in behavior.. 

In those few weeks she was at my house I gave her everything she needed, paid everything she needed and shared everything I had even though I really couldn't miss it. This is the thanks I get.. 

She has gone complete radio silence ever since that last text 1 week ago, all her stuff we took from her moms house to mine is still at my house. Everything from all her clothes make-up and whatever.. Tried texting her to make appointments to pick it up but no reaction, only reading it.. 

The last few months she pulled my head above water mentally. Only to throw me back with a rope and a rock around my neck by dissapearing, ghosting me and leaving me with nothing but questions.. Didn't even know you could ghost someone you are living with.. Also have had the panic attacks almost daily since, I dont entirely say thats her fault since the past 1,5 years have been truly shitty but she was the straw that broke the camels back.. 

Sorry for the long story but having no answers to my questions is eating me alive..

I'm looking to move to France and trying to determine the best path. I did not go to school in France, but am hoping to find a job there or in the EU. I have the minimum funds to support myself for a year based on what I've seen but I'm curious what #'s other people have seen as the minimum requirement. I have close friends who live in Paris, so they could help with address/etc. I speak fluent spanish and some french.

On the long stay visa, could I work in say, a coffee shop or a restaurant or store to earn money? I can't tell based on the french sites I've found whether that's allowed. Ideally I'd do this while I stay and look for a more corporate job that could get me a longer term work visa.

I could, hypothetically, also apply for the young traveller visa - I am a dual citizen in one of those countries. However, my partner is over 30 and we would be moving together, she could not get that visa on her own and I can't tell if they can extend to DP/spouse. This would require me getting my 1st passport in this country, so a bit more logistically difficult, but I'd do it if it was beneficial in some way/allowed me to work where the other one didn't/etc.

Please tell me what to do, I have no idea at this point.","I'm in law school which wasn't even my choice to begin with and to make it worse I'm in a disgusting college which is mostly full of people who are trust fund babies or nepo kids. I wanted to get into med school and turns out I'm too dumb for med school, so I wanted to do fine arts. I'll be on the street but hey, I'll at least think a little less about wanting to end it I guess. But now I'm stuck here, and after failing 3 subjects in first year I'm now almost done with second year and have okayish grades. I am trying my best right now, with academics because my health won't get better no matter what I do and my mother thinks I'll get addicted to PCOS medication and forced me to stop, I tried spearmint tea for a while and she made me stop that too. My father keeps mocking me and makes really disrespectful and sarcastic remarks every time I do or say something that goes against him, so does mom but she's more about shitting on my self esteem directly calling me fat and a slut which is almost a daily occurrence. My parents always want a reason to fight and even at the tiniest of problems they throw things and break them, yell at me or involve me in a fight they have with my brother which I'm not even a party to. I'm sick. I wanted to move out and knew I always wanted to live alone ever since I was 10. I don't even get allowed to go out and when I do they track me and I can't even meet my boyfriend (who I meet one in 6 months) or any of my friends peacefully. They say its about my 'safety' but all they care about is their goddamn reputation which they have because their son is a software engineer and got a house for them and of course he is the WiFi Password child. My mother found out about my boyfriend when I was 16 because my brother pulled my laptop out of my hands and saw our texts which were of course, like the type of stuff 16 year olds who like each other talk. Laptop got taken away, no phone, not allowed to go out with anyone, in a girls' school anyway for 11-12th grade. Now my mom doesn't know I still talk to him but we started talking again after I finished 12th grade and got my mom's old phone for slacking off by watching youtube or browsing through shopping apps and not buying anything. I went to the gym everyday, studied, and did whatever they told me to and tried my best to be 'the good kid.'  
Even after hours and hours of studying I still had average grades and my dad obviously had to say things to make me want to kms and my mom kept bullying me for not having friends and because I was fat (as a result of stopping my PCOS medication I could not lose weight even on a calorie deficit working out everyday and cutting back on sugar)  
I know I'm not happy and have done SH enough times to know I'm not sane and really need help, I needed it ever since I was 15 and I'm trying my best right now to stay busy with academics and can't do much right now and moving out is out of the question since I have no way to earn, again even if I did get a job I wouldn't be let out of the house and have no skills to use for online jobs. 

My mother goes to a point to control even the way I chew my food, do my hair and speak. She doesn't let me even buy baggy clothes, it's not even like they're inappropriate or whatever since I come from a slightly conservative city. I can't even do the good internships because they don't let me out of their sight. And my brother keeps aiding them and poisoning their minds with unnecessary paranoia. My mother has literally killed everything I could've ever become and she is 90 percent the reason why I want to die, I'm fucking done, I thought I had 3 weeks of not being a miserable piece of shit who wants to die and keep making barcodes on thighs and popping painkillers every time I had a fight with my dad who thinks I'm an incompetent slut and just like every other girl I should be thrown into the hands of an equally miserable dickhead the moment I turn 22, in the name of marriage. My mother has told me a billion times she never had an idea what to do with life and every thing she did so far was because she was ""told to do so."" She's told me she never wanted a second child (I'm the second child) because at that time my parents couldn't really afford one and they planned their marriage only for like one child. My brother is the first child, always been the first in class, gold medal in every olympiad he gave, got into IIT (a prestigious college which is really hard to get into in India) and stuff, did so well in a test his school hung a huge banner with his name and rank outside the college to advertise. He also had issues with socializing, making friends and couldn't survive college because of stuff he refuses to tell me and is on therapy because of the same. Now, I'm my brother's opposite, while I got heavily bullied in school till about 7th grade for being 'abnormal' always got accused of stuff I never did, weird rumours spread about me, got beaten up for reasons I can't figure out and people refuse to tell me.   
But, I've had a lot of non academic interests, unlike my brother who barely had any, and is just interested in anime and coffee. Both of which I also really love and enjoy.   
He never had friends in college and never went out. I do have friends for fucking once and can't go out without my mother guilt tripping me saying ""I never let your brother go out when he was in college""

My father. I don't even know what to say about him. All he cares about is himself. When I was a child and approached him for help with the bullying and weird false accusations he said ""well, maybe you did something and maybe you should just accept it. You're just a child and you don't have any problems. I have loans to pay"" I started banging my head against walls as an 8 year old because I wanted to die, since I had no friends and everyone around me had friends and genuinely enjoyed childhood. My mother blamed me for getting beaten up because I'm a softie and look easy to pick on. And now when I'm trying to do my best building connections the way I can she says ""I'm just looking for a way to date guys"" and my dad thinks his connections with people are top notch and if I connect with anyone other than the people he knows, I'm a loser. Literally every time I fail, all he does is pick up a paper and tell me this is how much expenditure I've had on your education, health problems, clothes, electricity and all your useless hobbies. I'm sorry, but why be a parent when it itches your ass to pay for the child to survive?  
My brother thinks I have it all easy and I just have first world problems and too much to complain about. Thinks I'm a spoilt fucking brat basically.

This is not about parents but I have one person that calls me her best friend, although enough of these ""friends"" have bullied me enough that I don't believe in the concept of best friends anymore. She has seen it all and is a Sui Attempt survivor herself. Even she asks me to suck it up and just move on and rawdog everything. I agree that she is also hopeless but is there really no hope? And no matter how much I love my boyfriend and after being together for nearly 4 years, I feel like he's just breadcrumbing me and talks to me only when it's of use to him. 

I really need help. But I can't do shit and nothing is in my hands. Should I just suck it up and bear it all till I finish college and bail myself out of this hellhole? What do I do?

Going to definitely start taking more (was taking 5g, now upping to 10... and likely 20-25 when sleep deprived or a bit stressed)

Didn't really know about the brain health benefits at all. Bone health too. When you only take 5g, it's only enough for your muscles, but around 10g/day, your bones start to benefit your brain, immune system, etc., all these other tissues. 

1) Creatine supplementation (25 grams or 0.35 g/kg body weight) rapidly increases brain creatine within just 3 hours, significantly improving memory and cognition after 21 hours of sleep deprivation - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=2527s)

2) Creatine at 5 grams daily increased sleep duration by nearly 1 hour on resistance training days in young women, alongside notable strength improvements - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=2941s)

3) Taking only 5 grams of creatine per day likely undershoots brain benefits‚Äîresearch shows 10 grams substantially boosts brain creatine levels, and temporarily increasing to 20 grams is ideal when sleep-deprived or stressed - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=2416s)

4) Creatine combined with more than ~250 mg of caffeine (about one Starbucks large coffee) disrupts calcium regulation in muscle cells, reducing its performance benefits - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5165s)

5) Creatine supplementation significantly eases depressive symptoms when combined with medication‚Äîlikely due to reductions in neural filament, a sign of brain cell damage - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=3235s)

6) Creatine taken alongside exercise increases muscle uptake by 37%, compared to 25% without exercise - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5024s)

7) It's totally safe for kids - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=4245s)

8) If you want to avoid digestive issues, just take it with food or break it up into smaller doses. - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=4863s)

9) No... it doesn't cause hair loss. That myth is based on one old study. - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5627s)

10) You don't need to cycle it. Take it every day. ~10g. Best timed around exercise. - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&t=5024s)

Went into BZ Mists thinking it was YZ just to do some YZ camp clearing in my 8.4 MP set that I spent 2 years playing this game grinding silver to get. I usually wake up in the morning before the family does just to play YZ mists for a bit to get my morning started doing some camps for easy fame tomes. Didn't even realize I was in the lethal mists and lost it in seconds obviously because I thought I could step away to refill my coffee. Came back to getting attacked by 2 other players and thats when I noticed Id been killed... I genuinely thought I had selected the YZ mists option. I know its my fault for not paying attention. So to whoever got that set I hope you found so much joy in killing me. I however and absolutely crushed... you did what you were supposed to do and good job.

As for me.. losing over 400M like that after devoting myself to the game as a means of enjoyment for over 2 years absolutely crushed my spirit... I honestly don't know how to even brush this off. I've invested so much into my character spec, collecting gear, donating silver to my guild who I genuinely enjoy playing with. But all that said I got a new perspective of this game... There is no mercy or forgiveness when you make a mistake like that. There is no going back, no asking for your gear back, no kind hearted people willing to give a person the benefit of the doubt because ""welcome to Albion""... Just like the real world, this game is cruel, punishing, and very little room for mistakes. Just like if I cost my work millions of dollars I would be out of the job. 

I guess all my ranting aside it is what it is and there's nothing I can do but vent. I know its no different that the millions I've spent on PvP sets but it sure as HELL hurts a whole lot worse... 

GG to whoever got my gear. I hope you were able to secure that 8.4 MP set and hope it brought you so much joy.

AITAH?,"I (24F) became friends with my boyfriend Jake (27M) two years ago. I was always secretly a bit interested in him but he was with someone else at the time, so I didn‚Äôt make a move.

During this time we used to talk about things like friends. I met a guy Eric that I developed a huge crush on. Eric never really cared for me, but I was crushing hard and ended up having sex with him a few times. Jake knew about my interest for this other guy but not that we had sex.

When Jake broke up with the girl he was with, he suggested we try dating. I was very excited by this, I had been hoping for it a long time, and I truly believe he‚Äôs the love of my life.

Where things go wrong is when Eric much later reaches out to me about a dinner we had planned for several months before, before he left to work abroad. By now, Jake and I were officially dating. I told Jake that Eric and I had planned for a dinner before, and obviously I wouldn‚Äôt do that since Jake and I were now officially dating, but that I would like to take a coffee with Eric if Jake would be okay with that.

I could tell Jake wasn‚Äôt really comfortable with this idea. He asked if I had ever had sex with Eric, because in that case he wouldn‚Äôt like that I went. This is where I fucked up, I told him that I hadn‚Äôt had sex with Eric and if I had, I would ‚Äúof course not have suggested to meet with him‚Äù.

I went for a quick, uneventful coffee. Several months after, Jake asked if it had really been true that I hadn‚Äôt had sex with Eric. I told him the truth this time, that I had. This has completely changed how Jake sees me. Primarily because of the lie, but also because he thinks that I was willing to lie because I still had stronger feelings for Eric.

This has really messed up our relationship. I just wanted to get a final closure with Eric through the coffee and I told Eric during this meeting how happy I was with my boyfriend. I love Jake to death.

It‚Äôs been one year since the coffee now but I can tell Jake sees me differently. He does love me doesn‚Äôt fully trust me and says he feels like the backup option.

I regret my actions so much and wish I could change it. I‚Äôve apologised to Jake so many times and treated him the best I could ever since, but nothing seems to help. 

I feel terrible about the mess I created but can‚Äôt help feeling that my boyfriend is taking an innocent coffee situation too far.

It's made by BrunoSX whose real name apparently Bruno Sousa. The only desciption he give about himself is next:

>I'm a Brazilian developer who really likes to program in Java and C.

What's suspicious is that his github account doesn't have any activity before Winlator. Yet what he does? He made an entire Android applications with interfaces to underlying Linux software like Wine, Xserver to support proper rendering and proper input. He even made a special shim Vulkan driver called Vortek that uses underlying vendor Android Vulkan driver! Isn't that too much work for a single individual? He has a small site with little to no design and single ""donation"" link on ""Buy me a coffee"". Doesn't seem very convincing if you asked me.

Even though Winlator is kinda open-source only sources for version 7 actually released and every update to repo goes in batches. That's how corporations prefer to work with open source when they develop things under the curtains and only dump changes with some intervals. If you want to see how real open source projects looks like check mobox repo: it's kinda Winlator competitor based upon Termux. Mobox does really looks like a work of a small individuals with the help of community

So my theory is that all this Winlator thing is a facade for Valve to develop Proton on Android. We already know for sure that they're developing Proton for ARM.",0,1743441355.0,linux_gaming,11,0.31,False

I'd rate it about 3.8/5 stars overall

## What I liked about Yu TrimFit Purple Tea

First off, I appreciate that this isn't just another repackaged green tea with laxatives. The Kenyan purple tea base is genuinely different from what I've tried before. It doesn't give me that jittery feeling I get from heavily caffeinated teas, which makes sense given it has 42% less caffeine than typical green tea

If you're sensitive to caffeine like I am, this is actually a decent alternative that won't have you bouncing off walls or crashing later

The appetite suppression effect is moderate but noticeable. I found it helped me avoid my usual 3pm snack cravings, which I attribute to the Caralluma Fimbriata in the blend. Nothing miraculous, but it does take the edge off hunger better than regular tea

However, it was still milder than some other brands like [this one, which is currently my no.1 pick](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) for appetite suppression, and weight loss.

## Where Yu TrimFit falls short

My biggest complaint? The proprietary blend. At 513mg total, I have no idea how much of each ingredient I'm actually getting. Is there enough Caralluma Fimbriata to make a difference? How much L-Theanine am I getting with my caffeine? This lack of transparency is frustrating and common in the supplement industry.

I also found the results to be modest at best as well as some people I coach. Those claims about significant BMI decreases and reduced abdominal fat? My clients didn't experience anything that dramatic, while using this alone as weight loss aid.

It helped a bit with appetite control, but don't expect miracles without diet and exercise changes.

## How it compares to other weight loss teas

Unlike those ""skinny teas"" that are essentially glorified laxatives (looking at you, detox teas that had me running to the bathroom every hour), Yu TrimFit doesn't cause digestive distress. As someone who had a horrific experience with a Chinese slimming tea that, as one user aptly put, ""made me crap out my soul,"" I truly appreciate this.

It's definitely better than those teas that are just caffeine bombs meant to speed up your metabolism temporarily. The polyphenol content in purple tea seems legitimate, and I didn't experience the crash I've had with heavily caffeinated options

**However, if you're comparing pure value, an affordable loose-leaf Japanese green tea like sencha might still give you similar benefits at a better price point.**

Many users in tea subreddits also mentioned simply drinking plain green tea helped them manage snacking without any fancy formulations

## Who might benefit from Yu TrimFit

If you're looking for a gentle appetite suppressant without laxative effects, this could work for you. It's especially good if you

Get anxious from high caffeine content

Want something to help curb snacking

Prefer a tea that won't cause digestive issues

If you're expecting dramatic weight loss without changing your diet or exercise habits, you'll likely be disappointed. Like most users have noted about various teas, they work best as part of a comprehensive approach to weight management

## Bottom line

Yu TrimFit Purple Tea is a decent, middle-of-the-road option in the weight loss tea market. It's not a miracle product, but it's not snake oil either. My advice? Try it if you're curious about the unique purple tea benefits, but keep your expectations realistic and remember it's a supplement, not a solution

## Alright, folks, let‚Äôs cut through the noise. If you‚Äôre _over_ hearing about green tea or matcha being the ultimate weight loss heroes, let me put you onto something next-level: **Purple Tea.** No, it‚Äôs not some gimmick or Instagram trend ‚Äì this stuff is legit

It's a SOLID TEA based on antioxidants that fight off **free radicals**, crush **inflammation**, and help with **fat loss** ‚Äì plus, they give the tea that cool, rich purple color.

## My current recommendations

While Yu TrimFit purple tea has its merits, [this brand (my rating 4.8 / 5)](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) is still my go-to weight management tea. What sets it apart is the brilliant two-phase system‚Äîa Morning Energy tea that kickstarts metabolism with green tea, oolong, ginseng, and garcinia cambogia, paired with an Evening Detox blend containing senna leaves, licorice root, and fennel.

I've found this comprehensive approach works better than Yu TrimFit's single formula by addressing both daytime energy/metabolism and nighttime detoxification/bloating.

The taste is remarkably pleasant (especially with natural monk fruit sweetness), making it something I actually look forward to drinking, unlike many weight management teas.

After trying dozens of tea formulations over the years, this remains the most balanced and effective option I've found for managing appetite, energy levels, and occasional bloating without harsh side effects.

## What Makes Purple Tea Unique?

First off, Purple Tea is grown exclusively in the **high-altitude farms of Kenya**, where extreme UV rays force the tea plant to produce **anthocyanins** to protect itself. These compounds give it its vibrant purple color and make it a nutritional powerhouse.

**Purple Tea contains GHG**, a rare polyphenol not found in other teas. Studies show that GHG helps reduce **fat absorption** and enhances your body‚Äôs ability to burn fat by boosting liver metabolism. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs gaining so much buzz in the weight-loss world.

Compared to green tea, Purple Tea has **1.6x more polyphenols** and 42% less caffeine.

And the antioxidants ‚Äì Purple Tea has a **51% free-radical scavenging rate** compared to just 34% in green tea. That means it‚Äôs better at fighting oxidative stress, keeping your body healthy and energized.

## The Role of Purple Tea in Weight Loss

Unlike most weight-loss teas that rely heavily on caffeine or questionable additives, Purple Tea works through **science-backed mechanisms** that are actually good for your body.

Here‚Äôs the deal: Purple Tea contains a unique compound called **GHG** (1,2-di-O-galloyl-4,6-O-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-√ü-D-glucose)‚Äì it helps reduce **fat absorption** in your body while boosting **fat metabolism** in your liver.

Basically, it tackles the fat storage process at two key points. So, instead of storing those excess calories as fat, your body starts burning them more efficiently.

In studies, people who consumed Purple Tea daily for **4 weeks** saw significant improvements in weight-loss markers:

- **BMI decreased**
- **Body fat mass reduced**
- **Abdominal fat and waist size shrank**

In animal studies, it also reduced **triglyceride levels** (those fats in your blood linked to obesity and heart disease).

Chronic inflammation can actually make it harder for your body to shed pounds by slowing your metabolism. Its **polyphenols** and **anthocyanins**, which fight **inflammation** and oxidative stress help in weight loss too.

Purple Tea also contains **caffeine**, but at a much lower level compared to green or black tea. This small amount gives your metabolism a gentle boost without causing energy crashes.

## Additional Health Benefits of Purple Tea

It is a **super drink** packed with health benefits that go way beyond burning fat.

1. **Packed with Antioxidants**: Purple Tea contains a **higher level of antioxidants** than green tea. Thanks to compounds like **anthocyanins** and **EGCG**, it fights **free radicals** in your body, which are responsible for aging, inflammation, and chronic diseases. It‚Äôs like giving your body a protective shield against oxidative stress.
2. **Improves Brain Health**: Purple Tea‚Äôs **EGCG** (epigallocatechin gallate) and antioxidants protect brain cells from damage and may help prevent **cognitive decline**. Early research even shows its potential to fight **degenerative brain diseases** like Alzheimer‚Äôs.
3. **Blood Sugar Control**: If you‚Äôre diabetic or trying to keep blood sugar in check, Purple Tea helps regulate **glucose absorption**, preventing those post-meal sugar spikes.
4. **Cardiovascular Support**: With its unique mix of polyphenols, Purple Tea helps reduce **bad cholesterol** and triglycerides while protecting your heart.
5. **Low Caffeine Content**: Unlike energy drinks or strong teas, Purple Tea gives you a mild caffeine boost without jitters. It‚Äôs perfect for hydration at any time of the day.

 

## How to Use TrimFit Purple Tea for Weight Loss

**1\. Brew it Right:**

- Use **1-2 teaspoons** of Purple Tea leaves for an 8-ounce cup.
- Pour hot water (around 175-185¬∞F; not boiling) over the leaves and let it steep for **3-4 minutes**. Over-steeping might make it slightly bitter.

**2\. When to Drink It:**

- For best results, have Purple Tea **20-30 minutes before meals**. This helps reduce fat absorption from food and supports digestion.
- Try drinking it in the morning or early afternoon to kickstart your metabolism without the jitters you‚Äôd get from coffee.

**3\. Consistency is Key:  
**To see noticeable results, aim to drink **2-3 cups daily**. Studies showed that consistent use over **4-6 weeks** led to significant reductions in body fat and waist size.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid adding sugar or cream. If you need a bit of sweetness, a drop of honey works well.

### **Pros**

  **Promotes Digestive** Health: Reduces inflammation in the gut and supports a healthy microbiome

###

### **Cons**

  **Mild Effects:** Results like weight loss or metabolism boost require consistent use over time; it‚Äôs not a quick fix. I and my clients have had better results with other brands

  **Limited Availability:** Not as widely available as green or black tea; premium pricing may apply due to exclusivity

  **Subtle Caffeine Boost:** If you‚Äôre looking for a strong energy kick, Purple Tea‚Äôs low caffeine content might feel underwhelming

  **Taste Preference:** The earthy, mildly floral flavor may not appeal to everyone, especially those used to sweeter beverages

 **Not a Standalone Solution:** Works best as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle; cannot replace proper nutrition or exercise

  **Potential Interactions:** May interact with blood sugar or blood pressure medications; consultation with a doctor is recommended for specific conditions**.**

It's a pretty compact L-shaped lean-to that wraps around our living room, with some narrow French doors to the interior. A large double sliding door opens on to the garden. We don't really use the space ""around the corner' except for storage and currently just have a couple of IKEA Poang armchairs and a coffee table looking out to the garden. However, because the space is a bit shallow, the flow doesn't feel great - it's like you're always manoeuvring round the armchairs.

It's an original sunroom from the 1920s so although we're having it reconstructed because the timbers are rotting, we're not changing any dimensions or the general style. 

Any suggestions would be very welcome. I've thought about a corner sofa in the bottom left corner - but it feels odd to not be facing out to the garden. My other idea was for a small 2-seater sofa on the right hand wall, but I think it's almost certainly too tight and will mean the French doors can't fully open on one side.

I was walking out each night with $150-200 in cash, so don‚Äôt feel sorry for me on that front.

However, EVERYONE is asking for tips now. My standard has always been 20% when someone comes to my table, sometimes 10% and sometime no tip for takeout depending on the situation, $1 per drink or 20% on the total at a bar, and nothing for things like coffee or scenarios where the employees are making over minimum wage. What is protocol now? I‚Äôm assuming that places like Starbucks are paying their employees more than just enough to cover taxes. If I do leave a tip, how do I know that it is even going to the employee I left it for? How do I know if Starbucks is keeping a portion of these tips for themselves? What about when we are ordering food to go? I‚Äôm being asked for tips there too. Why would I tip someone at a drive through window the same as I would tip someone who waited on my table? Many places in Europe, people will get visibly mad at you if you are seen tipping at all because they think it is stupid and they don‚Äôt want us bringing this nonsense to their cultures.

### Social Sips

Adaptogenic beverages do not have to be consumed alone. Integrate them into your social gatherings for added fun:

Most of his skincare is out of stock, so it‚Äôs really just the original moisturizer, Morning Dew and coffee eye creams, the coffee face mist, the Wyoming nourishing oil and lip oil, the milk face serum and leave-on mask.

I don‚Äôt really take naps, but I really want a lazy week day with you. One of the days where we both have to get up early and do the whole school drop off routine. We meet back at home, quickly strip down and climb in bed. We‚Äôll have coffee and breakfast, do some reading or watch a movie. 

Or maybe it‚Äôs a trip to the grocery store when it‚Äôs still early, before everyone gets there. I know I always walk fast, but I can slow down for this one. I usually only like to grocery shop by myself, but I feel like I would enjoy it with you. I feel like you would pull me back from getting lost in the fruit section looking for that perfect persimmon to paint without being an asshole. You wouldn‚Äôt rush me when I‚Äôm double checking the ingredients. 

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm ready for all the quiet moments with you. The mundane moments that no one brags about out. 

We both now how much sexual desire I have trapped in these bones. I just attempted letting some out, but I guess that‚Äôs my cup that never empties. (It‚Äôs my day off, I‚Äôm enjoying it, thank you.) 

We both want to share grand meals with champagne and interesting courses. Finishing with amaro and cappuccinos before we have a nice walk home. 

But I also know that we‚Äôve both been married, we both know where the real beauty in partnerships hides. 

The quiet moments. The routine. The knowing your partner so well you don‚Äôt have to talk. Trusting your partner to get your order right. Surprising each other with little thoughtful things.

Wild way to start a Joy Tactics post but hear me out. 

I had a pretty scary mental health crisis on New Years Day. I will spare the more triggering details. Just at a low point due to life difficulties, failures, and addiction. And while I‚Äôve made efforts to limit staring into the void of the current political climate but that certainly didn‚Äôt help. Fires had just happened in LA where I have a lot of close friend. Elon Musk‚Äôs hideous giant head haunting me in the background as him and Trump laid out their first 100 days. 

Sufficed to say I was not seeing much hope for the year ahead personally and globally. These are struggles I‚Äôve dealt with most of my adult life and I‚Äôm probably a little older than a good few of the tacticians out there. I have support systems like great friends and recovery but I still get the kind of tunnel vision that can override that.

Once I backed away from the edge, I called a close friend and my therapist. As I dreaded the repercussions I needed something light to get my mind off of things. 

In times like these I often turn to podcasts and Joy Tactics has been a major source of calm. 

The topic of conversation was them lamenting that their episode titles used to be better and it had me laughing me very hard. Just the way their delivery makes things like this sound like real problems is always so funny.

Hearing the boys talking in their soothing midwestern voices about irreverent things with poignant and wistful commentary mixed in really helped in that moment. I also have a very similar background to Eric so I often sense a relatable emotional weight and quiet darkness under his humor. This is why some call him the Cormac McCarthy of the alt comedy scene.

Jumping ahead, i still have a very long road ahead but I‚Äôve gotten more levels of help and major self-help to get back on track.

So if you‚Äôre in a dark place, I hope something similar can help. Maybe a funny pod while you play Balatro, drink a nice coffee, or clean the kitchen can be the thing you need to get out of your head.

So remember. We are shaped by our thoughts. We become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.

1jo80xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1jo80xn/half_bossa_nova_and_rockn_roll/,Half bossa nova and rock‚Äôn roll,"For party-goers, I'm the homely friend. Good for deep conversations, coffee and impulsive confessions, but never reliable for the sacred rites of hedonism. Someone who can hear the late night stories, but never star in them. For the caretakers, I'm the agitator in disguise. The one who has not yet accepted her real nature, the one who has a subtle inclination towards perdition and who, from the window, watches the movement of life with a sparkle in her eyes that should shame a true hermit.

It seems like there is an incessant ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù, and my mere existence, as I move between these two realms, reinforces the borders even further. The simple fact of not being completely one transforms me into the other. And how dare I question this well-established order? How dare I not choose a side?

The worst thing is that they both take themselves too seriously. The comedy begins when I realize the effort put into this performance.

Bohemians ‚Äî and they are still the most fun ‚Äî reach a point where they begin to tell their stories with that paternalistic air of someone explaining to a child how babies are born. The tone is always the same: the indulgent superiority of someone who has ‚Äútruly lived‚Äù and now grants the listener the honor of absorbing crumbs of this libertine wisdom. But, of course, you can't tell everything. Oh no. There is always a detail left out, a calculated mystery, because you ‚Äî poor innocent soul ‚Äî are not ready for this conversation.

Tacky.

On the other side, we have the tired pigeon. The former hedonist. The converted. He who once threw himself into the world, but today carries the expression of someone who survived a moral apocalypse. He doesn't tell stories ‚Äî he warns. Pleasure is deceptive, youth is an illusion, worldly joy has an expiration date. And then comes the clinical look, the sentence delivered with melodramatic regret:

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know anything yet‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre going to go through a lot of hides.‚Äù

Oh, of course. The same speech as always, the same script.

If you read something you like, you are wasting time.
If you go out to have fun, you will soon realize the existential void that this causes.
If you don't leave, you're not living.
If you laugh, you are naive.
If you don't laugh, you get bitter too soon.

And all this coming from someone who, in half an hour of conversation, has already lamented at least five times that the world is no longer the same.

Partygoers want parties. Young people are frivolous and ‚Äî surprise ‚Äî they don't want to sit in the dim light to read Dostoevsky or to discuss moral values ‚Äã‚Äãwith a guy who, two hangovers ago, probably still believed that ‚Äúhappiness is a choice‚Äù.

And in the end, what am I? A spy among the calm? An infiltrator? A scam? Or just someone who realized that this war between ‚Äúthose who live‚Äù and ‚Äúthose who reflect on life‚Äù is just a veiled dispute to see who feels more special?

Ultimately, I'm left in limbo. Party-goers seem to desperately need an excuse to feel free. The painfully mature, have an excuse to feel wise.

Picture this: you‚Äôre about to enter a 3-4 days journey with 300+ sessions distributed among 20 tracks. Ah, and there are 12k+ people with you. Everything is massive. You‚Äôll hit you 10k steps by just chasing talks before lunch time.

Here are my tips to make the most out of the week:

* **Choose your talks beforehand**: plan the talks you want to hear each day. I choose 2-4 per day. I prefer to decide the rest based on things I learn on site from conversations.
* **But don‚Äôt be too ambitious**: leave room to spontaneity and for the venue to be too big to make tight schedules actually possible.
* **The good coffee queue is worth is**: usually there are coffee stations served in big pots, but it‚Äôs pretty terrible. There tend to be two barista stations with a seemingly long queue, but it moves fast and the difference is MASSIVE. They also have much better tea.
* **The sponsors can be actually fun**: I‚Äôm biased because I also do booth duty, but chatting with companies that you‚Äôre interested in, or checking out who‚Äôs new in the market can be interesting.
* **Sign up to Happy Hours**: KubeCon networking really consolidates itself at the happy hours that surround the main event. There are dozens in total, some of which are institutions already, like Humanitec‚Äôs [House of Kube](https://houseofkube.com/) or [Kuberoke](https://ti.to/kuberoke/kuberoke-spring-party-london-2025). \[Promotional\] My company (Rootly.com) is also hosting three events in case you want to check them out:

1jo7vdx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jo7vdx,"White2tea Snitch: Am I doing it wrong? (Well yes, but ..)","I'm a recently converted puer drinker after spending most of my adulthood drinking black coffee. I still have a lot of my coffee making gear which I have adapted to tea.

I started dabbling in puer through shou, and to be honest I still prefer it. It was the only kind of tea I tried that could match the flavor intensity of the coffee I like while still being interesting and not corrosive on my stomach.

I decided to upgrade my tea appreciation by buying some sheng from a local store. I hated the astringency of it at first, but came around to appreciating it and how the sensation evolves over time.

So, the next logical step was to buy a bunch of random cakes from a well regarded vendor. 2024 snitch was my attempt at figuring out what a high quality young puer ought to be like.

I'm confused. This tea is weak. I was expecting to have a mouth pucker from the astringency of a young puer, but I barely noticed any flavor at all. I tried doubling the amount of dry leaf I would usually use and it was better, but still so mild. I sense some interesting flavor nuances but so fleeting. Like smelling a bouquet from across the room.

I have a weird pour over setup as you can see. It's worked ok for me so far with cheaper teas. Some of them are intense enough that I get more flavor than I want with a single pour. Sometimes I re-pour two or three times to get the intensity I want, especially after the first flush. But Snitch, ironically, just didn't want to give up the goods.

I came here to ask for advice. I want to respect this tea and give it the best chance to impress. But I really need a way to draw more flavor from it. Other than ""buy proper tea equipment"", does anyone have advice?",1,1743439850.0,puer,25,0.54,False

1jo7t8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jo7t8x/my_kidnapper_released_me_two_days_ago/,My kidnapper released me two days ago,"I've been free for exactly two days, twelve hours, and seventeen minutes. Not that I'm counting. Actually, that's a lie. I am counting. Every second feels like a miracle and a nightmare simultaneously. Every tick of freedom is weighed down by what I know and what I can't bring myself to tell anyone.

Three years.

That's how long I was held in that basement. At least, that's what they are estimating at the hospital due to my blood work. Time blurred together in that windowless room, marked only by the steady drip of a leaking pipe and his footsteps on the stairs. That drip. That goddamn drip. Sometimes I would lie awake counting them until I reached thousands, feeling my sanity slip away with each watery pulse.

I don't remember who I was before. Not anymore. The worst part is knowing that I used to remember. For the first few months of captivity, I clung to my identity like a lifeline. I had a name. I had a home. I had people who loved me. I had a life.

But he couldn't stand it when I'd recite these facts to myself in the dark. He'd fly into rages when I'd whisper my real name over and over like a prayer.

""You're no one,"" he'd scream, bringing his fists down on my head, my face, my temples. ""You're mine now. Nothing else.""

The doctors at the hospital believe I have severe brain damage from repeated trauma. Scans show old fractures in my skull that healed without medical attention. Dark patches on my brain where blood pooled and scarred. Memory centers, damaged beyond repair.

Now the police ask questions I can't answer. Did I have family? Friends? A job? A home? The only clear memory I have from before is standing outside a Trader Joe's, nearly dropping a paper bag of groceries as one of the handles ripped. It was raining lightly. I remember thinking I should have brought an umbrella.

Then a hand clamped over my mouth. A bag over my head. The smell of chemicals. Darkness.

When I woke up, I was in that room. Concrete walls stained with substances I tried not to identify. A thin mattress on the floor that reeked of mold and worse things. A bucket in the corner that he'd empty only when the stench became unbearable even to him. A single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling that he would turn on and off at random intervals, destroying any sense of day or night I might have clung to.

The first month, I screamed until my vocal cords shredded.

I clawed at the door until my fingernails tore off, leaving bloody streaks on the wood. I begged whatever god might be listening to either save me or kill me. Neither happened.

He never told me his name.

I never saw his face clearly. At least... for the longest time I didn't see his face, not that finally seeing it helped. I'll explain soon. He always wore a mask when he came down, a plain white medical mask at first, then more elaborate ones as time went on. Sometimes animals. Sometimes cartoon characters. The Mickey Mouse one was the worst. He'd wear it on days he decided I needed to be ""disciplined.""

I won't describe what that entailed. I can't. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

It was painful. Horrific.

That cheerful mouse face watching as he told me I was his masterpiece, a true blank canvas. That humans should be grateful for lives that are full of endless opportunities.

Once, he didn't feed me for two weeks. Just water. By the end, I was hallucinating, seeing shadows dance on the walls. When he finally came down with a plate of cold spaghetti, I wept with gratitude. I kissed his feet. I would have done anything. I did do anything.

The strangest part was how routine it all became. The terror never fully subsided, but it evolved into something duller, more manageable. Sometimes he'd bring me books. Dog-eared paperbacks with coffee stains and torn covers. Sometimes he'd sit in a folding chair and make me read to him, correcting my pronunciation instantly when I stumbled over words. Sometimes he'd leave a small radio that only picked up static and religious broadcasts. The preachers' voices became as familiar as my own thoughts.

When winter came, I could tell from the bone-deep chill that seeped through the concrete. He'd bring down a space heater sometimes, but only if I'd been ""good."" I learned to stop shivering in his presence because it annoyed him. I learned to regulate my body temperature through sheer will. I learned things about survival that no human should know.

I stopped asking why. I stopped begging to be released. I stopped speaking altogether around the two-year mark. What was the point?

The silence became my armor. He hated it. He'd scream at me, shake me, try anything to make me talk. But I'd retreated so far inside myself by then that my body was just an empty shell. Sometimes I would watch him from somewhere above, like I was floating near the ceiling, observing this broken girl with matted hair and skin stretched tight over protruding bones.

The worst times were when he was kind. When he'd bring me a warm blanket. When he'd clean the infected cuts on my legs with surprising gentleness. When he'd read to me as I drifted off to sleep. Those moments confused me, made me question everything. Stockholm syndrome, the hospital psychologist called it later. I call it hell.

Then, two days ago, he came down the stairs without his usual measured steps. He was rushing, frantic. No mask this time. And his face... I know he wasn't wearing a mask.

It was human skin. But no eyes. No mouth or hair. No ears or nose.

No features at all.

Just... a blank... canvas.

That's all I remember about his face.

""Time to go,"" he said, injecting something into my arm before I could react. As consciousness slipped away, I heard the basement door open again. Shuffling. A muffled cry. Another person.

""Your replacement has arrived,"" he whispered in my ear.

I woke up on a park bench twenty miles from the house where I'd been held. My hospital bracelet says Jane Doe. The police have been kind but frustrated by my inability to provide details. I can't describe his face even though I finally saw it.

But I remember his voice.

The way it would soften when he was about to hurt me. The slight lisp on certain words. The wet sound of his mouth when he'd lean close to whisper things he planned to do to me. It's strange how my brain protected some memories while obliterating others. The neurologist explained that severe, repeated head trauma can create a patchwork of memory loss. ""Your brain sacrificed your identity to preserve your survival instincts,"" she told me. Sometimes I still feel the phantom pain of those blows, the ringing in my ears that wouldn't stop for days, the world tilting as I tried to hold onto who I was before everything went dark. And last night, as a nurse was checking my vitals, I heard a news report on the small television in my hospital room. A 19-year-old girl had gone missing outside a Trader Joe's. One town over from where we are now.

I should tell the police everything I know. I should help them find her. I should be doing something, anything.

But I can't. I physically can't.

Because as he was preparing to release me, after I'd heard those muffled cries from upstairs, unmistakably female, young, terrified, he grabbed my face with one gloved hand, squeezing until I thought my jaw would break.

""Listen carefully,"" he whispered, his breath hot against my ear. ""You're going to leave here. You're going to stay quiet. If I see one police sketch, if I hear one whisper that you're helping them find me, I will cut her throat while playing a recording of your voice. She'll die believing you killed her.""

He showed me a phone then, replaying snippets of my voice he'd recorded over the years. My pleas, my screams, even my reading voice from those bizarre sessions where he'd make me read aloud from classic novels for hours until my throat was raw.

""I've already told her all about you,"" he continued. ""How you helped pick her. How you're my partner. She thinks you've just gone out for supplies."" His tone was nothing less than excited. ""She's waiting for you to come back. For three years, just like you waited.""

But here's the thing that keeps me frozen, the thing I haven't told anyone until now:

When he released me, he whispered something else: ""You did so well, I'll be coming back for you. This is just intermission. And remember, her blood will be on your hands if you talk.""

And on my discharge papers from the hospital, tucked into the folder the nurse gave me this morning, I found a small note on Mickey Mouse stationery:

""Miss you already. The new girl isn't nearly as much fun. She keeps asking when you're coming back. I told her you'd return soon to help me with her. Tick tock.""

Along with the note was a small USB drive. When I plugged it in at a library far from the hospital, it contained only a single video file. Ten seconds of footage showing a young woman, blindfolded and gagged, huddled in the same corner of the same basement where I spent three years. A timestamp on the video showed it was recorded just four hours ago.

In the background, my voice, pieces of recordings stitched together, saying: ""Don't worry, I'll be back soon. We're going to have so much fun together.""

I've been free for exactly two days, twelve hours, and twenty-three minutes.

But I know I'm still not free at all. And neither is she.",55,1743439703.0,nosleep,5,0.97,False

This is about the fastest, low-latency online gaming setup I could come up with. Now I got the VINE invite last year, and its been a blast until the half a second chocolate gang showed up on VINE.

Listen, I'm not sure how you do it, but somebody grabbed 4 different vines with Halal Chocolate in what seemed like half a second, reliably. Every other no tax treat is gone just as fast. I'm not even clicking on anything anymore, because there is literally not one second that goes by, before those items are gone.

I tried hovering the mouse curser in anticipation over the refreshing list, I'm still about 1-2 seconds too slow. How is this possible, if it isn't high frequency bots?

According to google, human reaction time is 250ms at best, but sometimes faster in high paced action games, that have been put into muscle and brain memory. There is a minimum of 3 interactions to order a product, so a perfect brain on a lot more coffee than mine would at a minimum take 750ms, not including computer loading times. I just don't see how its humanly possible 4 times in a row, reliably, in under a second.

I'm a nerdy, awkward, introvert [looking](https://imgur.com/LH4uHwi) for a long-term, monogamous, childfree relationship. I can be slow to warm up to people, especially physically, but definitely a cuddler once we've established that rapport. People I'm comfortable around know to expect bad jokes and general goofiness. I'm living the millennial dream as a WFH desk jockey with an unrelated bachelors degree, renting an overpriced 1-BR apartment.

What I'm looking for:

A woman (sorry boys) who is introspective, desires to grow as a person and have a positive impact on the world around them. Someone who is open to sharing their whole self and receptive to me as a full person. A partner in the most complete sense of the word... Pretty lofty goals for a reddit post, so realistically I'd be happy to chat with like-minded folks.

An assortment of things I like:

- Running ([it's fun, I swear](https://imgur.com/ULqymRk))
- [Hiking/backpacking](https://imgur.com/QDyrXjj) - sometimes I even make it to [the summit](https://imgur.com/nijcLiE)
- My family - they're good people and like me, it's great
- Broccoli - all-star vegetable (*must be cooked)
- Learning something new or working on a project in my ceaselessly growing backlog
- Reading, mainly fantasy
- Coffee - top tier beverage and flavor
- Hearing different perspectives on how the world ""really is""
- Podcasts - ""The Rest is History"" was my top listen in 2024
- Puzzles, riddles, and scavenger hunts

For those that don't like to look at pictures here's how I'd describe my appearance:

- 5'10"" (179cm for the enlightened)
- Kinda thin, but working on gaining muscle through calisthenics
- Skin tone which puts me firmly in the ""burns easily"" category
- Short-ish brown hair with length varying by season/ambient temperature
- Bearded, out of convenience
- Glasses - to ensure I conform to ""nerdy"" stereotypes
- Pierced ears, because it's less commitment than a tattoo

Even if you can endure my dumb jokes, my lifestyle and views may not appeal to you. Here are some of the big ones which may be turn-offs:

- I'm somewhat frugal and working towards financial independence. I have a decent job in a field that interests me, but I find having a 9-5 to be a grind. I would not describe myself as ""ambitious"" and any desire I have to advance my career is rooted in the hope that by achieving financial security I will be able to live a [simpler, more fulfilling life](https://imgur.com/c4MOGIN).
- I'm car-free. Living in the Boston area allows me to get around without needing a car, which I value highly. I'd much rather be stepping, pedaling, or strap-hanging than behind a steering wheel. I live on the Red Line if that means anything to you. I think cars are one of the most destructive inventions of all time and will talk your ear off about it given the chance (you've been warned). I know most people in the US need a car to get around and definitely don't judge those that do. I dread moving to a place where I'd need to own a car again, but it feels almost inevitable.
- Leftist. I think most everyone can agree that there are lots of problems in the world today. I don't think our current system, with so much power in the hands of so few, is good for the well-being of most people. I spend time thinking about what a post-capitalist society could be and how to realize that change (cringe I know).
- Atheist. Was raised in a non-religious household and never felt drawn to it. I'm wary of the coercive power that ""eternal damnation/salvation"" can exert.
- Child-free. Although, if you're here it's probably the opposite of a deal breaker. Never really had an interest in kids and now that I'm the age where my peers are having kids, I'm more confident it's not for me. I have fun playing with younger relatives but it's nice to be able to hand them back to their parents when it's time to go (or they start crying).

Other factors which may influence your opinion: minimal alcohol & cannabis consumption (no issues with partner use), kink-friendly, and a bit of a loner.

Overall, a lot of this is exaggerated, nuanced, or wrong. What's right, doesn't personally sway my vote when compared to my other choices, but I'm still undecided. Some of this requires sourcing on your claims. 

**1. Voted against environment and climate nearly 400 times in 20 years as MP**

There is a difference between 'anti-environment' and 'anti-regulation.' I don't think the 400 votes have ever been listed fully (source me if I'm wrong) but I believe many were just 'environmentally adjacent.' But I won't deny that Poilievre is far from being an environmentalist. He's recent stances on the environment are not something I personally worry about though (this is coming from someone who donates to environmental causes regularly)

**2. Voted for cutting tens of billions from public health care funding, including $196.1 billion for surgery and ER wait times**

This sounds worse than it was. For the tens of billions number, they adjusted the increase over time, they didn't reduce it directly.

As for the other claim, you'll have to source the $196.1 billion amount, because the NDP website talks about it, but the link mentioned bill C-38, which has nothing to do with healthcare. 

**3. Consistently voted for anti-choice bills and motions**

He did, but he's changed his stance on that. His policy is now pro-choice.

**4. Stood behind Ottawa trucker convoy, supplied coffee and donuts**

He did. I'm okay with it. He's denounced the blockades, but supported peoples freedom of speech. I don't agree with the convoy, but my agreement shouldn't dictate what people can/cannot protest.

**5. Blamed Trudeau for inflation despite global post-COVID trends and Canada‚Äôs low rate**

He did. I won't defend this. See point 15.

**6. Voted against COVID relief for Canadians**

He voted against an extension, not against the original COVID relief, which he supported. COVID was a mess, so this is nuanced.

**7. Little grasp on economics, believes in debunked trickle-down economics**

This is an opinion. He pushed tax cuts, not trickle-down economics. Note that he‚Äôs so far promised a tax cut for the lowest income bracket, not the biggest.

**8. Voted to cancel school lunch programs for kids in poverty**

No school lunch program exists to cancel. Conservatives voted against a bill proposing it (C-322) because they believe it should be left to the provinces. Ontario, as an example, already has one. I agree. Less Federal involvement, please. 

**9. Instructed MPs to keep silent on gay rights**

Source this. I‚Äôve seen him publicly speak in favor of gay rights. He was against them in 2005, but so were many (Like Obama, as an example). People grow.

[""I would lead a small government that minds its own business,"" Poilievre said in June.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dpde9dxp0o)

**10. Voted against housing initiatives, including First Home Savings Account (FHSA)**

I‚Äôll benefit from the FHSA, but I was still against it. I‚Äôd prefer they fix the underlying problem. Poilievre agreed.¬†

As for the other votes, there is nuance. For example, in 2009, Poilievre voted in favor of 2009 Bill C-10 which included $2 billion for social housing via CMHC.

A lot of the initiatives he voted against weren‚Äôt due to housing, but spending. His goal is less government, not anti-housing. His current policy promises agree to this.

**11. Voted against aid for Ukraine, silent on Navalny**

He originally supported Ukraine aid. He still does, but wants to shift it from money to energy.

[Here is his condemnation on Navalny‚Äôs death](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1758528011106766911?t=C4GPnExdvP-WmjstJ788Zg)

**12. Voted to cancel Veterans Disability**

Source this. Veterans Affairs budgets passed under Harper with Poilievre‚Äôs support. I see nothing like this in his voting history.

**13. Said Aboriginals need hard work over residential school compensation**

He did. He's since apologized.

**14. Intends massive austerity cuts to all federal spending**

I‚Äôll wait for his policy before I comment on this. I‚Äôm okay with less government spending.

**15. Scapegoated Liberals for interest rate hikes despite Bank of Canada independence**

He did. But this is nuanced. Trudeau may not have caused interest rate hikes, but his policy does play a role. 

**16. Voted against Canada Child Benefit**

This is nuanced. The CCB existed under Harper. The Liberals wanted to change it, which Poilievre voted against citing the change would cost more. I disagree with Poilievre here, as I think the new system is easier to manage and would net a similar amount.

**17. Housing Minister when 800,000 affordable units sold off, prices up 70%**

Source the 800,000 number if you can, and tie it to the Harper government.

According to CREA‚Äôs number, home prices rose 46% under Harper and 61% under Trudeau. Harper‚Äôs rose a steady 4-5% increase year over year. Not so under Trudeau.

**18. Voted to slash OAS/CPP**

Source this, I can‚Äôt find it. Maybe you‚Äôre talking about an increase to the OAS age that was reversed?

**19. Threatening transgender rights**

No, he‚Äôs not. All he spoken against was hormones for minors. Like with the gay rights claim, he was less government in your life. So his government won‚Äôt take away any rights. 

**20. Chief strategist is a Loblaws lobbyist**

This is true. It doesn't sway my vote.

**21. No environmental plan, just gutting programs**

He‚Äôs for green technology, not taxing carbon. I'm okay with this approach. 

**22. Refuses national security clearance**

He‚Äôs spoken to this. I think he should get it. I don‚Äôt think it will bring to light anything against Poilievre though. He‚Äôs just playing politics with the optics.

**23. Supports ag-gag, opposes animal welfare**

In terms of the ag-gag bill, he voted for a bill that aimed to toughen penalties for trespassing on farms. This technically counts of a gag bill, but I completely understand the vote.¬†

He did vote in favor of live horse exports and that's‚Ä¶ fine. I don‚Äôt like factory farming, but I can‚Äôt push my opinions onto others. I vote with my dollars here.¬†

If you can source the votes for animal experimentation, please do. I can‚Äôt find a record.¬†

**24. Carbon Tax as main inflation driver**

Agreed. It‚Äôs not the main factor. It is a factor though. This is just political talk to me. 

**25. Voted to cut unemployed support**

He voted against an extension (Bill C-20, 2020), not a total cut.

**26. Won‚Äôt support pharmacare/dental care**

He's changed his stance on this.

**27. Supports ‚Äúright to work,‚Äù voted against anti-scab 8 times**

He does. I‚Äôm not sure how I personally feel about it. That said, unions have been supporting him lately.

**28. Will defund CBC**

Yes, and I agree. For nuanced reasons. 

**29. Advocated Bitcoin replacement**

No, he didn‚Äôt. He just supported bitcoin. Had you invested $100 when he said that, you would now have¬† $174. I don‚Äôt invest in bitcoin and think it‚Äôs a bad investment personally, but people can invest how they want. 

**30. Nearly half Conservative governing body are lobbyists**

This is no longer accurate. There are now 3 active lobbyists (15%). If you include past lobbyists, you get 6 (so 30% total). ",1,1743439371.0,u_LakeDrinker,0,1.0,False
1jo7o1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1jo7o1k/old_kdramas_are_better_when_it_comes_to_romcom/,Old kdramas are better when it comes to romcom,"Ive been a kdrama fan since the 2000's. 

I have seen a lot of kdramas in the last 25 yrs. I srsly think that old kdramas which are arounf 2005-2016, where the best for romcom, if you would notice, dramas at that time most of them does not have this unecessary plot of childhood connection. Most of them where typical girl meets guy kind-a story that is cute and authentic connection.

Examples of that would be:

-Coffe Prince
-My Name is Kim Sam Soon
-City Hall
-Smile You
-World Within


And, kissing scenes then where more natural? If you get what I mean? Even though it is scripted it does not feel like it, now, on kdramas you can actually see the actors hesistancy and awkwardness when going for a kiss. So hard to watch, thats why I only watch kdramas with mature actors, they are more natural in that aspects, new actors or become actors around 2018 or so, does not give me those romance feelings. 

Some dramas that lookslike they are not acting back in the 2005-2015.

-Scent of a Woman
-Padam Padam
-Coffee Prince
-K2

I hope producers and writers would notice the shift of kdrama watchers, that we like more mature kdramas, when the characters age is in their 30, they shouldnt act as if they bunch of 13 yrs old asking for a play, they are in 30s, make a person act by their characters age whose in a supposed relationship in their 30.

1jo7nyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jo7nyn/how_do_i_go_from_hopeless_to_actually_being/,How do I go from hopeless to actually being successful?,"A little background about me - I'm a 27M, international student in Dallas from India. I've never dated anyone before even back home & I'm still a virgin cause I never took the initiative to ask anyone out due to extremely poor social skills, terrible physical appearance & crippling fear of rejections. But I cannot take it anymore, now that I see almost everyone around me happy in relationships having the time of their lives. As expected, dating apps so not work for me (not even in India) - I've only been able to manage one actual date in the 3-4 years that I've used them. 

This fear of rejection that holds me back mainly stems from the fact that everytime I look at myself in the mirror, I only see flaws & nothing good about my appearance. And for some reason the more I try to work on improving my appearance, the worse it gets. I have acne scars, hyperpigmentation, oily skin, forehead wrinkles, uneven coffee skintone, dark circles, broad nose, unfit physique, short height (5'7""), gray hair (almost 90%), graying beard as well now, etc. I just don't see how I can ever come across as even remotely attractive to any woman out there when almost every other man is better looking than me. I'm also an introvert who doesn't have any flirting skills. I know for a fact that I come off as the most boring person in the world. I've also never had a lot of friends to begin with. So naturally my social skills aren't that great to be able to successfully flirt with women. The best I've managed do is being a good friend to a woman but never more than that. It hurts seeing everyone else get what I want & is pushing me down the drain of hopelessness & despair everyday.

Even trying to fix all the flaws in my appearance & personality now seems like a herculean task, cause there are so many of them. I'm in a situation where I'm overwhelmed with where to even start & at the same time deathly scared that if I don't start I'm gonna die alone.

I know this was a long read but to everyone who did read it all the way, Thank you!",0,1743439333.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False
1jo7n6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_zaph0x/comments/1jo7n6t/seeking_a_connection/,Seeking a connection,"Hey!

I'm a nerdy, awkward, introvert [looking](https://imgur.com/LH4uHwi) for a long-term, monogamous, childfree relationship. I can be slow to warm up to people, especially physically, but definitely a cuddler once we've established that rapport. People I'm comfortable around know to expect bad jokes and general goofiness. I'm living the millennial dream as a WFH desk jockey with an unrelated bachelors degree, renting an overpriced 1-BR apartment.

What I'm looking for:

A woman (sorry boys) who is introspective, desires to grow as a person and have a positive impact on the world around them. Someone who is open to sharing their whole self and receptive to me as a full person. A partner in the most complete sense of the word... Pretty lofty goals for a reddit post, so realistically I'd be happy to chat with like-minded folks.

An assortment of things I like:

- Running ([it's fun, I swear](https://imgur.com/ULqymRk))
- [Hiking/backpacking](https://imgur.com/QDyrXjj) - sometimes I even make it to [the summit](https://imgur.com/nijcLiE)
- My family - they're good people and like me, it's great
- Broccoli - all-star vegetable (*must be cooked)
- Learning something new or working on a project in my ceaselessly growing backlog
- Reading, mainly fantasy
- Coffee - top tier beverage and flavor
- Hearing different perspectives on how the world ""really is""
- Podcasts - ""The Rest is History"" was my top listen in 2024
- Puzzles, riddles, and scavenger hunts

For those that don't like to look at pictures here's how I'd describe my appearance:

- 5'10"" (179cm for the enlightened)
- Kinda thin, but working on gaining muscle through calisthenics
- Skin tone which puts me firmly in the ""burns easily"" category
- Short-ish brown hair with length varying by season/ambient temperature
- Bearded, out of convenience
- Glasses - to ensure I conform to ""nerdy"" stereotypes
- Pierced ears, because it's less commitment than a tattoo

Even if you can endure my dumb jokes, my lifestyle and views may not appeal to you. Here are some of the big ones which may be turn-offs:

- I'm somewhat frugal and working towards financial independence. I have a decent job in a field that interests me, but I find having a 9-5 to be a grind. I would not describe myself as ""ambitious"" and any desire I have to advance my career is rooted in the hope that by achieving financial security I will be able to live a [simpler, more fulfilling life](https://imgur.com/c4MOGIN).
- I'm car-free. Living in the Boston area allows me to get around without needing a car, which I value highly. I'd much rather be stepping, pedaling, or strap-hanging than behind a steering wheel. I live on the Red Line if that means anything to you. I think cars are one of the most destructive inventions of all time and will talk your ear off about it given the chance (you've been warned). I know most people in the US need a car to get around and definitely don't judge those that do. I dread moving to a place where I'd need to own a car again, but it feels almost inevitable.
- Leftist. I think most everyone can agree that there are lots of problems in the world today. I don't think our current system, with so much power in the hands of so few, is good for the well-being of most people. I spend time thinking about what a post-capitalist society could be and how to realize that change (cringe I know).
- Atheist. Was raised in a non-religious household and never felt drawn to it. I'm wary of the coercive power that ""eternal damnation/salvation"" can exert.
- Child-free. Never really had an interest in kids and now that I'm the age where my peers are having kids, I'm more confident it's not for me. I have fun playing with younger relatives but it's nice to be able to hand them back to their parents when it's time to go (or they start crying).

Other factors which may influence your opinion: minimal alcohol & cannabis consumption (no issues with partner use), kink-friendly, and a bit of a loner.

On my recent visit, we got to chatting, and I mentioned that I might not be around next week since I'd be celebrating my wife‚Äôs birthday. Naturally, he asked what I‚Äôd be getting her, and I told him about some fancy removable heels. When I mentioned the brand‚ÄîPashion Footwear‚Äîhe burst out laughing. It was a little off-putting, but I asked him what was so funny. He said he had worked with Pashion products and revealed that they're made in China. I was a bit shocked, but I told him the quality seemed fine for products from there. He agreed that the quality was decent, but his issue was with the pricing. Apparently, the heel kits on the website cost about $8 each, and with shipping and storage, they should be around $12‚Äì13 in total. 

A few days later, he brought me some heel kits and a pair of Pashionista heels in my wife‚Äôs size (he‚Äôd asked for her size during a previous chat, which I thought was odd since I assumed prices varied by size). I asked how much they cost him, even with a discount, and he said they cost him nothing. He explained that these were slightly damaged or dirty products that Pashion had asked his office to destroy. I couldn‚Äôt find any noticeable damage, except for a tiny cut on the top that‚Äôs barely visible. Even though I initially refused the products, he insisted I take them since they were going to be destroyed anyway. 

While I did accept them, I have to say I‚Äôll never buy from Pashion again. The products are fine, but the corporate greed is too much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, health-conscious consumers have shifted their focus toward functional beverages, leading to a surge in popularity for drinks that do more than just quench thirst. These drinks promise added benefits, from enhanced energy to improved focus, digestion, and overall well-being. One exciting result of this trend is the growing array of options available, ranging from classic coffee to unique mushroom-infused drinks.

Coffee has long been a staple in many people‚Äôs daily routines, prized not only for its rich flavor but also for its energizing effects. However, as consumers become more aware of health benefits, the coffee market has transformed. Now, you can find various blends infused with adaptogens, such as ashwagandha and rhodiola, designed to help manage stress and enhance mental clarity. This trend has led to coffee brands innovating their product lines, offering not just caffeine but holistic health benefits.

For those curious about alternative options, mushroom-infused drinks present an intriguing avenue. These drinks incorporate medicinal mushrooms known for their various health benefits. Some popular mushrooms and their benefits include:

- **Reishi:** Known for its calming properties, reishi mushrooms are often linked to stress relief and improved sleep quality.
- **Chaga:** This powerful antioxidant is celebrated for its immune-boosting abilities and may help reduce inflammation.
- **Lion‚Äôs Mane:** Often touted for cognitive health, lion‚Äôs mane may enhance memory and support neurogenesis.
- **Cordyceps:** Commonly used for increasing energy and athletic performance, cordyceps can benefit those looking for a natural energy boost.

When blended into beverages, these mushrooms create a unique flavor profile that pairs surprisingly well with coffee, teas, and smoothies. Many brands are taking notice and starting to create blends that make the most of these earthy flavors while providing health benefits.

As you explore the world of functional beverages, it‚Äôs essential to consider not just what you‚Äôre drinking but how these drinks fit into your overall lifestyle. Are you looking for a mid-morning energy boost? A reishi latte could be the perfect choice. If you want improved focus during your afternoon slump, a lion's mane-infused tea might do the trick. Understanding your needs can help steer you towards the functional beverages that work best for you.

You may also find that combining traditional beverages with functional ingredients opens a world of possibilities. Consider trying a simple mushroom coffee recipe at home. Here's how:

1. Start with your favorite brewed coffee.

Not only is this drink delicious, but it also packs a health punch! Mixing beverages with functional ingredients allows for creativity and personalization that stores-bought drinks may lack.

The market continues to grow, with countless brands developing creative blends. As you explore, check the ingredients and quality of the products you choose. Look for brands that prioritize transparency regarding their sourcing and preparation methods, as this will greatly affect the quality of the functional benefits.

In addition to convenience, many companies are committed to sustainability and eco-friendly practices. Always opt for brands that align with your values. Whether you‚Äôre at your local grocery store or browsing online, remember to pay attention to labels and ingredient lists. This habit empowers you to make informed choices about the beverages you consume.

As you navigate the rise of functional beverages, from coffee to mushroom-infused options, keep an open mind and be willing to experiment. Who knows? You might discover a new drink that fuels your body and mind in ways you never thought possible!

Functional beverages are no longer a trend but a lifestyle choice. With the right selection, you can improve your health and satisfy your taste buds simultaneously. So, embrace this new beverage revolution, and enjoy exploring all the benefits these drinks offer!

Health Benefits of Incorporating Functional Drinks into Your Daily Routine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining optimal health can sometimes feel like a juggling act. With numerous products on display in grocery aisles, it's easy to overlook one category that has gained momentum in recent years: functional drinks. These beverages do more than quench your thirst‚Äîthey offer a range of health benefits that can significantly enhance your daily routine.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
Functional drinks come in various forms, from kombucha and herbal teas to mushroom-infused elixirs and protein shakes. Each type offers unique advantages that can aid in everything from digestion to enhanced focus. Here‚Äôs a closer look at how incorporating these drinks into your diet can provide real health benefits.

### Boosting Immunity

Many functional drinks, particularly those containing herbs and adaptogens, can support your immune system. Ingredients like elderberry, echinacea, and reishi mushrooms are renowned for their immunity-boosting properties. By sipping on a daily dose of these nutrient-packed beverages, you can help your body ward off illness, especially during seasonal changes.

### Promoting Gut Health

Probiotics, commonly found in drinks like kombucha and kefir, are excellent for digestive health. They promote the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut, which can improve digestion, reduce bloating, and even support mental health. A healthy gut is linked to various bodily functions, including the absorption of nutrients and overall immunity. Including a gut-friendly beverage in your daily routine can lead to a happier and healthier digestive system.

### Enhancing Energy Levels

If you're looking for a natural pick-me-up, consider functional drinks infused with adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha or ginseng. These ingredients are known to help the body manage stress and fatigue. Rather than reaching for that afternoon cup of coffee, try a refreshing adaptogen-infused tonic to boost your energy without the typical crash associated with caffeine.

### Supporting Mental Clarity

Functional beverages can also play a vital role in enhancing mental clarity and focus. Ingredients such as matcha, yerba mate, and even certain mushrooms like lion's mane have been celebrated for their cognitive benefits. By adding these drinks to your morning or midday routine, you can experience increased alertness and productivity throughout your day.

### Hydration with a Twist

Staying hydrated is essential, yet many people struggle to drink enough water daily. Functional drinks offer a flavorful alternative to plain water, making it easier to meet your hydration goals. Look for options that include electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals to keep your body replenished and energized. Whether it‚Äôs coconut water or herbal-infused water, these beverages can make hydration enjoyable and beneficial.

### Simple Tips for Functional Drinks

- **Start Slowly:** If you‚Äôre new to functional drinks, begin with one beverage per day and monitor how you feel.
- **Experiment with Different Types:** Explore various drinks to find out which ones you enjoy most and which suit your health needs.
- **Read Labels:** Pay attention to the ingredients. Look for natural options without excessive sugars or additives.
- **Create a Schedule:** Consider incorporating functional drinks into specific times of your day, like mornings or post-workout sessions.

Functional drinks into your daily routine doesn't have to be complicated. A quick visit to your local grocery store or farmers' market can unveil a variety of options just waiting to be tried. Whether you're swigging down a probiotic-rich kombucha or sipping a calming herbal tea, your body will thank you for this flavorful health boost.

The world of functional beverages offers something for everyone. From improved digestion to enhanced focus, the benefits are plentiful.

Dive into the vibrant world of functional drinks and discover the many ways they can elevate your daily routine. Your body and mind will reward you with a rejuvenated sense of vitality and wellness.

### Conclusion

As the world of beverages evolves, the shift from traditional coffee to innovative mushroom-infused drinks highlights a growing trend focused on health and wellness. These functional beverages offer a unique way to enhance your daily routine with benefits such as improved energy, better focus, and heightened immunity. By integrating these drinks into your diet, you not only enjoy diverse flavors but also embrace a lifestyle that prioritizes your well-being.

I love 3 shots of espresso with a little bit of water. Sometimes I‚Äôll order an iced americano at a coffee shop and the water can be overpowering and dilute the entire drink for a weaker experience. I would love to start making my own coffee at home but spending that kind of money for a machine seems like a lot. I‚Äôve read tons of forums and watched tons of videos saying a Moka pot can achieve similar strength and scratch that itch at a much cheaper price. Cool. So I bought a Moka pot. I‚Äôve used it about 10 times or so and I feel like it doesn‚Äôt even come close to what I‚Äôm wanting. I‚Äôm starting to think I just need to buy an espresso machine. Also I didn‚Äôt know if the experience would be much more enjoyable with the Moka pot if I freshly ground up the coffee before brewing? It seems like a lot of people say that can change the flavor a ton too. But I didn‚Äôt want to invest in a grinder just to find out it didn‚Äôt help the Moka pot experience. 

If I‚Äôm going to get recommended to buy an espresso machine, I‚Äôm looking for something convenient and quick for in the mornings. I used to have a nespresso machine which is obviously the easiest and quickest way to get coffee so I‚Äôm not expecting that level of speed but the Moka pot does take a bit more time then I‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve seen the manual machines which seems like a cheaper alternative that a full machine with all the bells and whistles. The only issue with that is would I have to pull 3 separate times? Any advice would be helpful! ",0,1743438849.0,espresso,3,0.5,False
1jo7gtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1jo7gtr/pets_keep_making_a_mess_in_one_specific_spot/,Pets keep making a mess in one specific spot?,"Hi all,

A couple days ago I made the mistake of making coffee before letting the dog out. Apparently he was kind of desperate because he pooped on my carpet. I cleaned it up no problems and thought that was it. 

Yesterday morning I asked my husband to take the dog out and he said yes but then started doing other things. I warned him if he didn‚Äôt take dog out soon he would go inside‚Ä¶ well, he ended up daudling another 10 minutes and dog pooped in the some spot. I cleaned it up again.

Today one of our cats looks me dead in the eyes and starts pissing on that exact spot. 

WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! We have never had issues with them going anywhere but where they are supposed to except for the occasional accident from the dog (but those are USUALLY infrequent!!) 

My only thought is that maybe dog did it once and even though I cleaned maybe there are still scents and now everyone thinks that‚Äôs the bathroom? I really need my carpet to not be the bathroom üò≠ is there a way to get rid of whatever they‚Äôre smelling to stop them from doing this?

Anyway. Pretty standard cheapish apartment carpet. I‚Äôve tried Arm & Hammer Pet Fresh Carpet Odor Eliminator and a generic pet odor eliminator fabric spray. ",1,1743438831.0,CleaningTips,5,1.0,False

So‚Ä¶ I guess my land is cursed. Or maybe this is all random chance and I‚Äôm one unlucky motherfucker. It‚Äôs been about 4 days since my last post here and I ended the post off with a bit of a promise that: If more spooky shit were to happen, I‚Äôd be quick to post it here. It didn‚Äôt take long. 

The same night I clicked the post button, I decided I deserved a walk. I enjoy walks, they are easy and calm and good for getting a lay of the land. My little corner of the world is situated in a part of Vermont too small for me to name here, just in case a half-dedicated one of you tries to come and pay a visit. It's rural and quiet. It‚Äôs also big as shit. One of the few good things I have to say about the US government is that they have a good selection of private properties for its former dirty-secrets to make a new life on.

My choices were Alaska, Vermont and Montana. I wanted the Alaskan land but apparently someone beat me to it and I owe too many people money in Montana to enter that state's borders safely. Vermont was fine enough, closest to family‚Äì I might have already said that but don‚Äôt hold it against me‚Äì and was overall the largest plot of land available to me. 

I had yet to commit the land to memory so on top of destressing on this walk, I planned on doing the extremely mentally demanding task of memorizing the entire property. Joining me on the walk was a set of knives strapped to my thigh under my shorts, a EAA 10mm Witness 2011 in a holster on my hip, my journal and pen, a cozy sweater, and an old pair of beat up Nike running shoes I‚Äôve had since college. 

On my walk I learned three things. 

1: The terrain of my land is immensely varied. Across nearly 150 acres I had hills, marshes, forest‚Äì obviously‚Äì, the edge of a mountain range, plots of meadows, plenty of creeks and ponds, and a large lake near the epicenter. Speaking of that lake, I discovered‚Äì after skipping a few rocks across it‚Äì that a quite irritable creature lives in it. I didn‚Äôt get the best look but it was big and pink. There‚Äôs a joke to be made there but I‚Äôm not brave enough to do so. After it settled down from its fit, it extended a curious crab-like appendage which after a soft pet sank back into the lake. I took out my journal and quickly scribbled a note. ‚ÄúPick up fish food.‚Äù I muttered to myself as I wrote. 

2: Some creature has been ditching its skin in the forest. Piles of rotting skin of various races with the same face were stacked near a pitch of rocks and boulders. Seeing this disturbing sight was‚Ä¶ odd, but it's unfortunately the second pile of skin I‚Äôve seen in my life. ‚ÄúBring tarp and feed the lake thing the skin.‚Äù I scribbled out the previous and scratched in the new one. Below that I added: Order trail cameras. I had a technician who was supposed to come out and install cameras into my cabin but unfortunately that wouldn‚Äôt be for a few weeks. 

And 3: As I hiked deeper into the most ominous and foreboding portion of the forest I noticed a low hum-buzz under the existing nature ambiance. It was faint and measured, but painfully noticeable when tuning my attention to it. It wasn‚Äôt a far away noise drifting along the waves of air all the way to little old me, no it was close. I slowly turned about, looking in every direction to spot if anything else was present with me in the gullet of the forest. It was the noise of presence. That subtle yet spine tickling pressure of another thing being around you. Maybe it was the serial skin-shedder, maybe it was some other fright, but either way I wasn‚Äôt prepared enough to find out. 

I hauled my ass back to my cabin at a speed I‚Äôm fully ready to brag about. I tumbled inside and slammed the door shut, locking it. I‚Äôm fine with facing scary shit. Seeing a threat is nothing new and so having something to look at and understanding how to combat it is a breeze. What I can‚Äôt stand is the overbearing weight of an unknown presence. It shivers me to my fucking core and I‚Äôd much rather fight a hundred crazies with a stick then spend 5 seconds with that feeling. 

Unfortunately for me, that feeling followed me home. 

I started the next morning with a cup of tea to quell last nights‚Äô night terrors of being pulled apart by beasts made of bone and rotten meat. It‚Äôs one of the better dreams I have all things considered. Top 5 at least. I walked out onto the porch and froze, unable to move as I examined my lawn. I hadn‚Äôt memorized the entirety of my land, but I knew my lawn down to each blade of grass. I‚Äôd know if one blade of my manicured yard was plucked and I certainly noticed the new tree that had sprouted up and matured on the edge of the treeline. 

Sluuuuuuurp. I finished my tea with a shiver as the weight of not being alone pounced on me. I was tempted to grab my FGM-148 Javelin and vaporize it, but incase you forgot from the last post, I‚Äôm not a liar. So, I‚Äôll be honest and tell you, I was curious. I‚Äôm not one for curiosity, we all know what killed the cat afterall, but I‚Äôm certainly one for pushing my luck. 

God‚Äôs honest, I just liked the tree. It was a different genus from its peers but it fit in nicely. Besides, how bad could it really be? It's a tree.

I‚Äôm a fucking moron.

I should have evaporated that oaky backstabber the second I spotted it. Would have saved me a lot of headache and ammunition. It took a day, a single rotten day, for the entire tree line encircling my cabin to be replaced with towering, dark leaved trees. They suffocated the light attempting to pierce into the treeline and choked any hope of an echo. Not even the most profound of curiosities could tamp down the crushing pressure of having something just over my shoulder. 

Most concerningly, thick and hearty bodied trees had cut off the gravel path that led out to the driveway. By all measures, I was trapped with nothing but me, my house, and an ATF-heart attack amount of munitions. Of my option, none seemed too bright: 1, I get up close and personal to investigate the trees. 2, grab the gallon of round-up in the cellar and hope I can clear the path out to town for some help. 3, unload a small‚Äì honestly closer to medium‚Äì sized army‚Äôs worth of rockets and explosives and raze hell. 4, wait.

None of these choices were smart.

Thankfully I‚Äôm not a smart man. 

I wheeled my mortar cannon onto my 2nd floor balcony and set a crate of 50 shells within reach. I lined up the trajectory with the tree line, delicately assuring the shell would drop dead nuts on the first tree that showed up uninvited. Before launching I stacked up other explosives, rocket and human propelled respectively, on the balcony as well. Lastly, I holsted my prize Deagle onto my hip along with my hawkbill. 

Taking a final moment, as the sun lowered; painting the sky in majestic hues of red, pink, orange, and golden yellow, I brewed a cup of coffee. Coffee goes good with fireworks.

‚ÄúFire away!‚Äù I shouted and sent the first shell screeching into the air. All things seemed to drag to halt as my breath slowed. The hunk of fine american engineering descended and‚Ä¶

‚ÄúScreeeequuuch!‚Äù The tree erupted in curtains of billowing smoke and cackling flame as the leaves melted like sickly wax. The bark slid and smeared as the flames bit. The branches drew into the tree and lost their hue of green and brown. The tree crumpled and collapsed into a pile of scream and reeling flesh. The saccharin meat writhed in agony as gills manifested from the pink and gray pile. A mouth, stuffed with teeth opened and took a titan breath. Its chest bubbled and expanded before shrinking as air blew from the gill, snuffing out the flames. It churned and ached, sputtering through bi and quadrupedal as it ripped off the cooked and charred flesh. 

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶‚Äù I loaded another shell and another, dropping 3 total shells on the thing. The second shell struck the center of the beast, blowing off its back half with a whimper. The third drilled straight through the head of the thing. The skull exploded like a popped balloon and threads of flesh tried to hold the skull together but failed as the brain was destroyed.

As it went limp all the tree its-peer collapsed from the form of a sturdy oak into rotten meat sacks resembling the recently deceased. This was a bit concerning. 

‚ÄúTook me two and half months to getting in a fucking war with the trees.‚Äù I grunted angrily as I sloppily adjusted the mortar and rapid-fired shells. Lines of wild flame set a divider between the front of my home and a pack of the shapeshifters. Correctly assuming I was surrounded, I grabbed up my javelin missile launcher and a pack of javelin missiles and walked to the backyard facing balcony. They had begun charging my cabin when I sent out the guided missile. Dirt and soot joined chunks of pink flesh as 6 of the things died. ‚ÄúThese are the days I wish I bought that fucking apache.‚Äù 

I ran out of missiles before I ran out of targets, a predicament not many are fond of. I still had a bucket of mortar shells, frag grenades, a few cups of napalm, and the weapons on my hip so I liked my odds. I ran to the front and tossed out a wall of napalm that caught an aggressive blaze for the flames of the mortar. A few were midstride, or going too fast to catch themselves before falling into the temperamental flames but a good 50 were still alive in total. 

I leapt off my balcony and tested out my pitching acumen, cooking and pitching grenades into the maws of the rotten bastards. My shoulder is still sore, I‚Äôm a lousy pitcher, and frankly I ain‚Äôt much of a hitter either. 

Soon I was out of grenades too, realizing a bit too late that I had abandoned the remaining mortar shells on the balcony. I drew my gun and got a clean shot through one of the shapeshifter‚Äôs‚Äì who I will now refer to as Mockingbirds‚Äì head before getting my arm bit down on and torn off.

‚ÄúOw, dammit!‚Äù I ducked another bite from the creature and drove my hawkbill up through its jaw into its skull and through the brainstem. Another mockingbird pounced on my back, sinking its fangs into my shoulder and whipping me away.

I pinwheeled through the air, shattering my skull against a rock as I tumbled. My spine connected with the stern of a tree, each vertebrae snapping in its own twisted tune. The searing pain died out as the nerves went cold, unable to feel as my head whipped too far back and crushed my brainstem against my cracked spinal column. A final gurgling breath escaped my mouth as I was dead. 

Darkness abounded. I was in an endless plain of all-consuming black. I was sitting. As I stewed there, attempting to comprehend why it felt so familiar, I was wrenched out.

‚ÄúAgh! Shit‚Ä¶ Ow‚Äì Wait‚Ä¶ why does nothing hurt?‚Äù I sprung to my feet, padding my body down to feel for even the slightest hint of pain. Not even a knick. My clothes were drenched in blood but my body was unscathed. The fires had died down and the Mockingbirds had flocked together, around my Deagel. 

I clenched my hand around my hawkbill and took in a final steady breath. 

I rushed forward, thrusting my dagger into the skull of a flailing Mockingbird. The momentum of the beast carried its claw forward and severed my arm. A stream of blood rocketed out but turned into faint steam as a fresh arm burst from the stump. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ alright. Neat.‚Äù I retrieved my knife and bolted for my pistol. I took the claws of a Mockingbird to the chest and snapped its neck, leveraging my arm against its claw. The wounds patched and three arms and a head later, I killed 5 more.

I dove for my pistol, getting just a few inches away before being ripped away. My spine vaporized and reconstituted in a blink. I snapped one of the creature's claws off and slept the beast. 

I never even reached my gun. Hours passed, getting eviscerated and killing one, by one, by one, by one. It was surprisingly pleasant. 

Near the end I was just a torso, halfway inside the final, wounded Mockingbird. I beat my fist against its insides till I reached its spine, biting it out as the rest of me dissolved in stomach acid. My body sprouted anew and I wiggled my way out of the slimy carcase. ‚ÄúWhat does it say about me that this is only my 3rd worst day?‚Äù I crawled to my feet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù I squealed as I stretched my new limbs. 

I retrieved my Deagle and cleaned off my knife. The next morning, earlier today, I cleaned up the lawn as best I could manage and began the gruelling task of clearing out the Mockingbirds. I managed to drag down about 8, I say about because a lot of it was chunks, before needing a break. That lands us here. I‚Äôm sitting in my lazy-boy, typing this out, watching that deer.

Once I‚Äôm finished writing this, I‚Äôll post it, then see get to work fixing my damn lawn. The lake creature is really starting to like me, more since I fed it the Mockingbirds. It finds those really tasty. Maybe I‚Äôll have to hunt down some more, if there are any more. Immortality? Maybe. Regeneration? Definitely. I don‚Äôt fully understand how I‚Äôm even close to being alive, but I am and that‚Äôs a fine enough reason for me to not ask anymore questions. 

Anyways, I won‚Äôt keep you any longer. I‚Äôve gotta get back to cleaning anyways. Adios friends. Till the next story I guess.

With my land, likely; not 100% yet, being cursed, I‚Äôm sure there is more to come. Peace.

I approached my decision in three steps:

1/ I first looked at the Profitec Go, which is widely praised here. However, I was concerned that it might limit future upgrades, as it lacks true pre-infusion and dynamic pressure regulation.

2/ Then I came across the Gaggia with Gaggiuino or Gaggimate, but I‚Äôd prefer to avoid such modifications if possible.

3/ I also considered E61 machines by increasing my budget to gain pressure control. However, the heating time is a major drawback. My work schedule is too unpredictable to anticipate making coffee 30 minutes in advance‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have a set routine. Plus, personally, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the E61 design.

Then, by chance, I stumbled upon this lesser-known machine, the Quick Mill Pop Up:

It seems to offer all the advantages of the Profitec Go for nearly the same price, plus everything it lacks:

- A dedicated espresso boiler and a thermoblock for steam
- Adjustable automatic pre-infusion
- Dynamic pressure control
I feel like it checks all my boxes. Did I miss anything?

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself‚ÄîI am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you

At 8:30am picked the tot up and went to her favorite breakfast sandwich place (it‚Äôs also mine) and got her an avacado bacon egg cheese croissant.  Ate with the tot at the place (extra food for me yay) then mom was up drinking the coffee I had made before I left.  

She still dreams of that much time alone, in her comfy PJs/robe, and no one needing anything from her or disturbing her. 

Would do this again but the breastfeeding schedule won‚Äôt allow.",5,1743438064.0,daddit,7,0.86,False

I had a girl I dated for a year and a half and that ended mid 2023. I went all this time without hearing from her and I have a baby due in 2 weeks and am engaged and have been for almost a year now. I used to work with my dad and it started two months ago, he said that her mom called up there using a fake name seeing if I worked there still but the caller ID showed her name. She also began making fake accounts to message my fianc√©e. She replied to one message before realizing it was her and blocking her. Now she is posting a lot of stuff on tik tok. First thing was harmless enough it was a video of her saying looking back I was kind of ugly but it didn‚Äôt say my name or a picture. Then she posted a side by side of me and a rat or something saying how ugly I was. After we broke up I had a run in with the law and she then posted a picture of my mugshot on her tik tok. And the comment was one like and I‚Äôll do a story time. I don‚Äôt have any social media my family had her on there still because they thought everything was cool and we ended civil enough, which so did I. They were the ones that saw it and showed me. They all reported it and left comments defending me before blocking her. I‚Äôve been saying to myself it doesn‚Äôt bug me and I‚Äôve been going through the days trying not to think about it and saying to myself I‚Äôm bigger than that. A side note is I had my car keyed about a year after we broke up and I didn‚Äôt think it was her at the time. Looking back I‚Äôm almost sure it was. The reason we broke up. I will say my side is my grandpa had passed away that month. She didn‚Äôt seem to care and wanted to make it about her was my vibe. I was drinking pretty heavy still being nice to her but I was helping her and her mom move and I was a bit tipsy. There was her cousin there helping and he was really disrespectful I let it go for a while. But I went to help him lift a coffee table and he was just like ‚Äú no I don‚Äôt think you got this‚Äù or something along those lines and I said ‚Äú what you think I‚Äôm a F ing P word ‚Äú and it kinda ended there because her other cousin just grabbed his side and we took it in. Her mom and her are really close and she never really liked me so she made her take a break from me because she thought I was psycho. In the meantime I waited about a month with no responses and blocked her on everything assuming we were broke up. That was when I had social media still. I never heard from them again until now.

The Russian Academy of Fine Arts recently featured an exhibition of work by Yuri Orlov, People‚Äôs Artist of the Russian Federation.

His art is defined by a desire to portray the realities of contemporary life with both precision and depth‚Äîyet always in a way that distills and expresses only what is most essential. Each painting seeks to encapsulate the artist‚Äôs thought in a concentrated, visual form.

Yuri Alexandrovich observes the world around him with great care, but mere impressions or surface effects are never enough. The sketches he creates in the moment are only the beginning; they serve as working material for more fully realized compositions that follow.

Precision is a defining feature of Orlov‚Äôs work. He aims to depict not only what he sees, but how he feels about it‚Äîchoosing subjects that move him, that strike a chord within. This emotional honesty and clarity come through in every brushstroke, making his art both deeply personal and universally resonant.

[March in Suzdal, by Y.A.Orlov. 2012. Oil on canvas. 72.5x112.5 cm. From the author‚Äôs private collection¬†](https://preview.redd.it/2pq428sqv1se1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ba587793a568d2d0c1a637133586f38d8c0f493)

His landscapes radiate a quiet enchantment, drawn from the rich variety and beauty of Russian nature.

When architectural elements‚Äîurban or rural‚Äîappear in his work, they are often centuries-old structures imbued with character and history. These older forms feel naturally integrated into the landscape, never clashing with it, but rather existing as part of the environment, telling stories of the past.

Orlov frequently paints¬†*en plein air*, as capturing a firsthand impression is essential to his process. These outdoor studies become the foundation for larger, more fully developed studio works. His¬†*plein air*¬†sessions aren‚Äôt just about a single view‚Äîthey‚Äôre part of a broader effort to grasp the essence of a place. He often paints multiple sketches from different angles, at various times of day and under changing weather conditions, so that he can later select the version that best aligns with his artistic vision.

‚ÄúMore than anything else, I enjoy painting in the early hours of the day and in the evening,‚Äù the artist shares.

‚ÄúThe colors are exuberant, the skies more solid, and the world takes on a dramatic presence.‚Äù

In his work, one can truly feel the crisp sunlight of a winter morning, the overcast stillness of a summer afternoon, the choppy motion of water, or the shimmering heat of the Crimean air. Orlov captures a wide range of natural moods with striking precision and sensitivity.

There is nothing accidental in his paintings. Every detail is intentional, shaped by his creative vision. This analytical approach allows him to move beyond mere impressions to something deeper: a thoughtful, distilled observation.

A clear example of this is found in his 1997 painting, ‚ÄúBaptism.‚Äù Rather than portraying the moment as a bustling, lifelike genre scene‚Äîcomplete with guests, crying children, and the lively stir of a group baptism‚Äîhe strips away the distractions. The focus becomes the Holy Sacrament itself and the family encircling it. The baptismal font forms a circle, echoed by the circle of loved ones‚Äîa symbol of unity and love. The somber background, subdued and almost abstract, underscores the sacredness of the moment, highlighting only what truly matters: the sacrament and the presence of family.

Light seems to seep through the darkness, illuminating the faces and figures just enough to enhance the emotional gravity of the scene, reinforcing the central idea of faith, unity, and spiritual intimacy.

[Baptism, by Y.A.Orlov. 1997. Oil on canvas. 155x200 cm. From the author‚Äôs private collection](https://preview.redd.it/8xpychxsv1se1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=031524a0c617a8abbc3f5f5dfe1445a9dbb6a70f)

The theme of family has always held deep significance for the artist.

As early as 1979, while preparing for a regional exhibition of the Union of Artists of the USSR, Yuri Orlov chose not to follow the trend of creating opportunistic, industrial-themed pieces. Staying true to the principle that an artist must speak from the heart, he painted ""Gone""‚Äîa composition that is both coloristically warm and emotionally complete.

At the center of the painting are the small figures of the artist‚Äôs grandparents, standing in front of their home. They gaze into the distance, toward their grandchildren‚Äînow grown and returning to their busy lives after spending the summer with them. The viewer, however, does not see the grandchildren. This absence transforms us into witnesses of a quiet, symbolic farewell‚Äîthe moment when adult children leave their ancestral home. The scene carries a subtle yet piercing emotional note, evoking both tenderness and loss.

Yet the warmth of the palette softens the mood, imbuing the painting not with sorrow, but with the lasting love that these two elders gave so freely‚Äîlove that continues to nourish and comfort their family. The painting received wide acclaim at the exhibition.

When we speak of a truly accomplished artist, we often speak of continuity‚Äîthe way in which one‚Äôs work carries forward the spirit of a tradition. Yuri Orlov is no exception, although in his case, this continuity stems not from direct mentorship, but from the deep, multifaceted layer of Russian art in which he was formed. Unlike many artists who followed a traditional teacher-student path, Orlov forged his own way. Nevertheless, he looks back with gratitude on his time at the Stavropol Art College, where he learned to engage deeply with both Russian and global culture.

‚ÄúI remember how our teacher, N.F. Kalinsky, used to read us classical literature during our lessons,‚Äù recalls Yuri Alexandrovich. ‚ÄúI can still picture it vividly‚Äîit‚Äôs winter, snow falling outside, and we‚Äôre inside painting a still life, listening to Chekhov‚Äôs stories.‚Äù

[Orchestra, by Y.A.Orlov. 2020. Oil on canvas. 100x150 cm. Studio of military artists after M.B.Grekov¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/ho7mf7hwv1se1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42916b3e4ff7b5146a3b0dbe0129ebdaed615c2)

He also never forgot his teacher‚Äôs advice: An artist must work in the here and now, without waiting for ideal conditions‚Äîbecause they simply don‚Äôt exist. Taking this to heart, he never waited. Instead, he worked constantly and persistently, which ultimately led him to the level of mastery he has achieved today.

Fortunately, during the Soviet era, there was a strong system in place to support young, talented artists, allowing them to grow and refine their skills.

Yuri Alexandrovich regards the renowned Russian painters, Sergei Petrovich and Alexei Petrovich Tkachev, as mentors both in art and in life. It was they who, in the late 1980s, recognized his talent and invited him to intern in their fine art workshop at the USSR Academy of Arts.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always admired their paintings,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbecause they depict real life, like the stories of Vasily Shukshin or the paintings of Arkady Plastov. There‚Äôs no intention to dazzle or impress the viewer. True, profound artists always strive to express their thoughts‚Äîto say something meaningful about the world.‚Äù

The same can be said of Orlov‚Äôs work. Not only does he faithfully reflect the reality of contemporary life, but he also has a unique ability to interweave different time periods within a single image.

Take, for example, his well-known 1990 painting ‚ÄúAt a Caf√© in the Evening.‚Äù At first glance, it seems entirely modern‚Äîa young man sits alone, quietly enjoying a cup of coffee. But then, just behind him, emerging from a dim passageway, we suddenly recognize ‚ÄúThe Chocolate Girl‚Äù, painted by Jean-√âtienne Liotard in 1743‚Äì1745. She appears as if stepping out of the shadows of time itself‚Äîa figure from the eighteenth century seamlessly entering the modern world.

Orlov‚Äôs work reminds us that our world is a tapestry of interconnected eras and cultures‚Äîa continuous thread that binds together time, space, and memory.

The painting, ‚ÄúStill Under the Golden Domes,‚Äù painted in 1987, depicts not only the realities of the past, the future, and the substance of creative thought, but it also points to another world, apparently existing somewhere very close to us.

[Still Under the Golden Domes, by Y.A.Orlov. 1987. Oil on canvas. 205x190 cm. Stavropol regional museum of fine arts¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/tsgkzah1w1se1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=b84a66846cc400d33e06462b13fe47226ac96132)

The artist enjoys playing with value contrasts, a la Caravaggio, and this gives depth to his works, certainly in meaning, if not in depiction.

In his painting ‚ÄúFamily Celebration‚Äù (1998‚Äì2000), nothing extraordinary seems to happen‚Äîit‚Äôs simply a family gathered around a table. Yet within the quiet stillness of the scene lies the fullness of familial connection, the rich and vibrant universe of the family itself.

Perhaps peacefulness is the word that best captures the essence of Orlov‚Äôs art. It runs through all his works‚Äînot as emptiness or silence, but as a stillness that is charged with depth and meaning. He has a rare ability to listen to and express this quietude even amid the noise and chaos of modern life.

But behind‚Äîor perhaps within‚Äîthat quiet, there is always something immeasurably greater, something profoundly significant that speaks softly but unmistakably to the soul.

I felt great and she made it super easy to break up with her when I did. I'm no longer in love but I sometimes feel I did the wrong thing.

I had a similar post in a subreddit a few months back and I apologize for the legnth of this post, and thank you to everyone who is willing to take the time to read and respond. That means the world. I just want some more input here. 

My now ex and I have known each other since middle school, nearly seven years. I‚Äôve always had feelings for her and she felt the same way about me. We never worked out in high school since we both went to different schools and long distance never worked out with us at a young age. We were always on and off until we just broke contact for like a year a half. 3 months before we both graduated high school I contacted her and told her I still had feelings and she felt the same way. From the beginning of April to the beginning of October we had an incredible relationship. Both each other‚Äôs first kisses, we both became intimate with each other for the first time ever with anyone. We truly loved each other and it was such a cute young relationship. We were both in dumb young love and I truly believed we were gonna get married

Only issue was, she‚Äôs a huge avoidant. Doesn‚Äôt like to show emotions over text, the phone, etc.  Her parents never knew about me so we didn‚Äôt see each other that often but when we did she was super physical and I can tell she loved me by the way she treated me in person. When we weren‚Äôt in person, she was always super dry, I always had to initiate being lovey and mushy, and I always felt like I had to beg her to show some emotion. I always felt neglected and felt more in love than she did. I was fine with this because I understand she might not be used to showing emotion but to what extent? I expressed this to her a few times and she would always tell me she would change..and never did.

Fast forward to late September and she started to have a lot of issues in the house. Her parents were constantly arguing and were on the verge of divorce, she tacked on an ample amount of work for college, and she was just stressed all the time. I know this was effecting her a lot and she started to not text me often, wouldn‚Äôt update me on anything, and she just lacked effort. The last two months of our relationship we didn‚Äôt see each other once. We used to FaceTime at least twice a week but now I hadn‚Äôt heard her voice for maybe a month. She never put in any effort all she would do is give me a cute goodmorning message when she woke up  or got to college and never text me again until like midnight when she‚Äôll tell me she finished all her college work. Every time we would make plans she would always cancel. It was always something new. She would rarely even apologize. It was just the norm. I just gave up and stopped making plans and waited on her to initiate something..and she never did.

I understand she was super stressed and had a lot on her mind, but I didn‚Äôt feel prioritized anymore. I always told her I was available to talk if she ever needed it and she never did. She always kept to herself. I knew everything was effecting her and I wanted to help as much as I could but I didn‚Äôt know how. She never gave me the green light for anything. This was so egregious where I didn‚Äôt even know what my role in her life was anymore. I would always question if I were even valuable to her, if I even made a difference. If me just merely staying there helped her in anyway? She just became super unavailable, unreliable, inconsistent, frustrating and difficult to love.

I felt incredibly disrespected because she never apologized, never explained the lack of availability, and was never there for me. Not to mention I felt like I was practically begging her to hang out anytime I would ask. If she was bothered by everything at home..tell me. She left me in the dark completely, always expecting something to change and it never did. She never told me just wait on her, be patient with her, About a month before I broke up with her I told her we had to speak in person. She gave me a time, place, and date..and she canceled last minute. A week later? Canceled last minute. We eventually called for the first time in a month and a half I explained myself to her. She apologized and told me she would change but to be honest, I already mentally broke up with her, but I gave her another chance. A week later I told her let‚Äôs grab coffee (with the intention of finally breaking up) and she canceled AGAIN. Enough was enough and I broke up with her over text. I let everything out in a very respectful manner. She reciprocated the same energy and said she understood.

Breaking up with her was one of the easiest things I‚Äôve ever done. She made it incredibly easy and not heart breaking in the slightest. It‚Äôs crazy to think how in love with her I was but now I just feel repulsed. This was my first ever relationship and I feel like I've grown so much and matured tremendouosly. I feel like I now know my worth and what I want and don't want out of a relationship. I also feel my self respect has increased tremdendously as well. She was an amazing girl just sooooo inconsistent. Did she become uninterested? I just don't understand. Despite how busy my life was and or would be (working full time, school full time, hobbies, etc) I would always make time for her regardless of circumstance. I can say with confidence she would've never done that for me at the end of our relationship. Was it really her avoidant personality or something more? If more, why did she stay and leave me in the dark? Was it her problems at home? Why didn't she tell me that if so? Could I had been a better partner or should I had stayed out of sympathy for her?

Despite how easy it was to break up with her, a part of me misses something. I don't think it's her. I'm no longer attracted to her as a person, and I wouldn't want to get back with her, but I miss being in a relationship, and sometimes I think I won't connect with someone better. We had such a strong bond and so many expereinces I will always appreciate. We built such a strong connection and I'm not sure if I'm ready to let go of the idea of her. She was my best friend and I loved her so many years. Will I truly find someone better or is she just going to be the one that got away in my life? Was this relationship a lesson more than anything? I know I will find someone better but it is tough to accept. It‚Äôs now been nearly five months since the breakup and I just feel incredibly lonely..",2,1743437930.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million and Kendu has went through several redistribution periods.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.  
  
Kendu has a heavy focus on IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

**Current market conditions**  
  
This is for sure worse than we expected at this point in the year, it is April tomorrow and things are well for lack of a better word‚Ä¶.. fucked. However ‚ÄúAll Things Must Pass‚Äù (I hope someone gets this reference) and things will get better, the cycle looks delayed but no one really knows. I believe 100% that there is a bull run coming and even if not, Pepe achieved a market cap of 11 billion without a bull run and Kendu can too. There is far more money in crypto now, so 11 billion mc is equivalent to probably double that now and 20 billion is a 2000x from here for Kendu.

¬†

In terms of the market:

¬†

As Satoshi Nakamoto said¬†‚ÄúIf you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.‚Äù

¬†

However I will try and convince you to buy Kendu¬†:)

**Why Kendu is organic**

Kendu is organic because organic memecoins tend to generate more results, whilst KOL based memes have a ceiling, organic memecoins are decentralised. Example of organic memecoins are Pepe, Doge and the one and only Shib.  
  
Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion market cap in 36 days, you could have turned $1000 to $1,000,000 in 36 days.  
Current market cap is not the most important, since crypto moves so fast.

**The Kendu Brand**

  
Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far

Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we give a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy), merch and I am pretty sure a new mural

Look at all these tattoos and there's one more that I can't add lol  
NEVER BET AGAINST A COMMUNITY LIKE US  
Tattoos show ultimate conviction  
  
  
I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

Always remember, to never bet against a community

We Don't Gamble, We Work
