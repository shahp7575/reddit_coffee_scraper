1r12swh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r12swh,"""Dividend adjustment"" 🤡","So I shorted Becton Dickinson (BDX) yesterday.

Closed the position today, felt pretty good: +€63.89. Nice, clean, in and out. Coffee money secured.

Literally minutes later T212 hits me with:

Dividend adjustment: -€74.12

…excuse me what?

End result: instead of a win I'm sitting at roughly -€10 after everything. From ""good trade"" to ""why do I even bother"" in one notification.

I get that when you’re short you owe the dividend to whoever lent you the shares. Fine. But the timing is brutal – and did BDX really pay a 36%ish dividend?Close in profit, dopamine hit, then BAM, UNO reverse card.

Is this just totally normal mechanics of shorting around the ex-div date and I’m the clown for not checking the calendar? Or is my T212 particularly ""efficient"" at collecting every cent?

Anyway, lesson learned: apparently you can be right on direction and still lose money.

I never heard of a flat whites but they intrigued me because my normal coffee order is a large 1 cream (no sugar).  I really liked them and bought a machine.

My favorite flat white comes from my home set up but because I use a Nespresso and a $20 Walmart milk frother and not a wand then I must be ragebaiting.

*Now boys to be clear I’m just here for one beer and then I’ve gotta be on my way.*

Then some said, *Let’s do a shot!* 

And I said, *Oh no I really better not!*

But one appeared right there next to my beer!

I didn’t want to seem rude so I went ahead and tossed it back.

That’s when the DJ turned on a hot track and I was on the dance floor with some girl half my age.

She wore me out and I went staggering back to the bar to quench my thirst!

I don’t know what time I got home.

I can’t find the cash that was in my wallet,

1r12mpc,https://youtu.be/PFVMFBQ7ZyA,Solo dev here. Launching my first co-op game in 10 days (Early Access). Nervous but excited.,"I'm Damian. I have been working on my first ever gamedev project titled **Piece of Ship** for a while now, and I finally hit the ""10 days to release"" mark. The anxiety is starting to kick in, so I wanted to share what I've been up to.

The game is a chaotic 4-player co-op where you try to keep a malfunctioning submarine afloat.

My main goal was to create a loop based on panic management. You have to fix leaks with duct tape, pump out water manually, and even dry wet fuses with a hair dryer to get the power back.

**Why I chose this direction:** Since I'm a solo dev which is not using generative AI, I made every assets by myself (the only thing downloaded from Unity Asset Store is a character model, but I also gave it some touch of mine). I focused on mechanics that generate ""funny chaos"" among friends. The sessions are short (10-15 mins) and randomised.

**Pricing strategy:** I decided to price it at **$3.99**. I know it's low, but my logic is to make it an ""impulse buy"" (price of a coffee) so it's easier for a group of 4 friends to just pick it up and play without overthinking it.

I'm launching in Early Access to actually learn from this. Roadmap includes more pre-set maps, random map generator, and more mechanics which hopefully I will get from players. I want this game to be built with community, ask them what would make it funnier, what's missing in their opinion.

I'm currently focusing on bug fixing (few left), UI polish and models texturing right now.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r12m2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/1r12m2h/im_trying_to_figure_out_how_to_beat_jet/,I'm trying to figure out how to beat jet lag....amongst other things,"Hey guys,

Not used to posting on Reddit, so bare with me...

I work in Tech Sales, and I travel frequently (around 50 flights per year). Most of these are international (Europe -> US usually) and I always end up completely out of sync and dealing with jet lag (especially on my return which is extra frustrating – being back at base but out of sync pisses me off).

Some people told me to try Timeshifter. Actually pretty good, but I'd forget to check the app until it was too late. I'd see the notification and think ""yeah I'll look at that in 5 min"" and then... never open it.  
Of course, I have also tried melatonin and tbh sometimes it hits well, but most of the time I forget it and – this is just my personal opinion – I don't really like putting pills in my body.

I have yet to find a solution that works for me, as I always end up just ""winging it"" when I arrive. The best thing that's worked is timing my flights strategically when I have the freedom to do so. But most trips are client-driven, so I can't always choose.

Anyway, given I work in tech, I decided I'll build something for myself. So that's exactly what I did (well, am doing). The core idea: push notifications that tell me exactly what to do, when to do it. Like ""stop drinking coffee after 2pm today"" or ""go to bed 30 min earlier tonight"", starting a few days before the flight. No app to check. No plan to remember.

Genuinely curious if this resonates with anyone else or if I'm just solving my own very specific organisational chaos (I'm obviously biased as the builder. Not trying to sell anything yet, but just figuring out if this is useful beyond me). I would really appreciate your feedback and sharing your experience, thanks!!

She replied a bunch of things and said that she will miss him for the rest of the year every week and every day. I was lil bit jealous, but this fine a normal to me.

Then a week later, she texted him regarding having a coffee when she’s in town because she moved out of town and she was updating about the drive the and now they should catch up when she’s back and this is when he message back that he miss her . I get that when they said bye. They already said they’ll miss each other but because he’s saying it again to me I just don’t imagine my boyfriend saying this to anyone especially twice in a week.

I think this just made me think about all the other times that he has lied and broken boundaries and I’m projecting all the past onto this because I still do not trust him . I just don’t imagine dating someone that does this, in the past I’ve had really healthy relationships where I just know that they’re not the type of people to say this type of things to any other female, I think because this person had a history of lying that this just doesn’t sit right with me.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

If its worth continuing to write this because honestly no one reads my work.. and i have lots made,"Have you ever felt like your life isn’t your own—like you’re a piece on a board, moved by something far smarter and far crueler than you?
Like the devil himself is playing a game, and you’re not a player… you’re the prey.

The rules are simple.

Survive.

My name is Devlin. I hold a PhD in psychology, and I work as a detective specializing in sudden disappearances and cases the police quietly abandon—mysteries that don’t make sense, the kind that crawl under your skin and refuse to leave. I’ve spent my life studying broken minds.

I never imagined mine would be next.

It was an ordinary Sunday afternoon. The kind that lulls you into a false sense of safety. I was alone in my office, the bitter taste of burnt coffee lingering on my tongue, paperwork stacked higher than my patience.

That’s when the letter arrived.

No return address. Just my name, written too neatly.

Inside were two things—and both made my stomach tighten.

The first was a folded note with a single address written in black ink. An address I didn’t recognize.

The second made my breath catch.

A ring.

Maria’s ring.

My ex-wife’s ring.

For a moment, I tried to be rational. A prank, maybe. Someone trying to rattle me. I forced myself to breathe and dialed her number.

No answer.

I called again.

Still nothing.

That’s when instinct took over. I grabbed my coat, locked the office behind me, and drove straight to her house.

When I arrived, I stepped out of my car and called her name.

“Maria? Are you home?”

Silence.

I approached the front door—and froze.

It was already open.

Not gently. Not carelessly.
Forced.

My pulse spiked. I drew my pistol and stepped inside, moving slowly, scanning every corner like I’d done a hundred times before.

Room by room.

Nothing.

No signs of a struggle. No overturned furniture. No blood. No mess.

Everything was clean. Too clean.

It was as if Maria had never lived there at all—as if the house itself was pretending she never existed.

Confused and unsettled, I stepped back outside and unfolded the note again, staring at the address. Whoever sent this wanted me to follow it. And right then, it felt like the only lead I had left.

That’s when a sharp knock hit my car window.

I jumped.

An elderly woman stood beside the door, peering at me with concern.

“Did you just go inside that abandoned house, mister?”

My heart skipped.

“Abandoned?” I asked. “That’s not funny. My ex-wife lives here. Her name is Maria.”

The woman frowned, genuinely confused.

“Son… this house has been abandoned for fifteen years. No one named Maria has lived here.”

I felt a sudden, blinding pain explode in my head. The world tilted, my vision blurring as if something inside me snapped. I nearly lost consciousness.

When it passed, the woman was staring at me, worried.
“You alright?”

“Yeah,” I muttered. “Just a migraine.”

But when I looked back at the house, my blood turned cold.

The porch was rotting. The windows were smashed. Vines crawled up the walls like veins. The fresh paint I remembered was gone—replaced by decay and neglect.

The house looked exactly like she said.

Abandoned.

I stepped out of the car slowly. “You’re sure no one lives here?”

She shook her head. “No one. No one’s wanted that place for years.”

I thanked her numbly and pulled out my phone, calling my assistant, Jerry.

“Jerry,” I said, keeping my voice steady, “pull up everything you can on my ex-wife. Maria.”

There was a pause. Then laughter.

“My ex-wife?” he said. “Devlin, you okay? You’ve never been married. And who the hell is Maria?”

My grip tightened around the phone.

She was real.

I still had her photos. Her ring. Her voice burned into my memory.

Yet it was as if the world had erased her—and left me behind to notice.

My chest tightened as dread settled in.

Whatever was happening, it started with that letter.

And the address.

If I wanted answers, I had only one choice left.

To follow the trail…
and walk straight into the devil’s game.

1r12a4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1r12a4l/how_to_be_more_attractive_the_psychology_nobody/,How to Be More Attractive: The Psychology Nobody Talks About (That Actually Works),"So I fell down this rabbit hole studying attraction for the past year. Not the ""wear red lipstick"" type advice everyone regurgitates. The deep stuff from evolutionary psychology research, body language experts, and way too many hours listening to podcasts about human behavior. Started because I was tired of feeling invisible in rooms. Now? People respond to me differently and I honestly didn't change that much externally.

Here's what I learned: attraction isn't about being hot. It's about presence. And presence is trainable.

**Your body language is screaming things you don't want it to**

Most people shrink themselves without realizing it. Crossed arms, hunched shoulders, eyes on phones. We're walking around broadcasting ""please don't notice me"" signals. 

Amy Cuddy's research on power posing gets clowned on sometimes but the core insight holds up. Your body position affects your cortisol and testosterone levels. Stand differently for two minutes and your brain chemistry literally changes. 

Start here: Track how much space you take up. Do you cross your legs tightly? Pull your arms in? Make yourself smaller in chairs? Attractive people don't apologize for existing in space. They sit back. Spread out a bit. Move deliberately instead of frantically.

I use the app [Finch](https://finchcare.com/) to build this habit. Set daily reminders to do posture checks. Sounds dumb but after a month it becomes automatic. The app makes habit building actually fun with a little bird companion, plus it has mental health check-ins that helped me realize how much my anxiety was affecting my body language.

**The eye contact thing everyone gets wrong**

We're told ""make eye contact"" but nobody explains HOW. Too much and you're intense. Too little and you seem shifty.

The trick from negotiation research: hold eye contact for 3-5 seconds, look away briefly, return. It creates a rhythm. Also, when you break eye contact, look to the side, not down. Looking down signals submission.

Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People. She ran a research lab studying thousands of hours of social interactions. The chapter on eye contact patterns blew my mind. She breaks down exactly what confident eye contact looks like with actual data. Plus the research on hand gestures and vocal tone. This book will make you question everything you think you know about charisma. Best communication book I've ever read, hands down.

**Attractive people move slower**

Watch someone with real presence. They don't rush. They don't fidget. Their movements are smooth and intentional.

Rushed movements signal anxiety. Slow, controlled movements signal confidence. This applies to everything: how you walk, gesture, even how you pick up your coffee.

I started practicing this by literally walking slower everywhere for two weeks. Felt ridiculous at first. Then I noticed people started holding doors open for me more. Making space. Weird but it works.

**Your voice matters more than your words**

Vocal tone conveys more than content. Research shows lower pitched voices are perceived as more authoritative and attractive across genders. 

But here's what actually helped: breathing deeper. Shallow breathing from your chest creates a higher, shakier voice. Breathing from your diaphragm drops your pitch naturally and makes you sound calmer.

The podcast [The Art of Charm](https://youtube.com/@artofcharmtv?si=PO6RI_5eIptsBpXe) has an entire episode on vocal presence with Roger Love, vocal coach to celebrities. He explains how to find your optimal pitch and projection. Game changer for anyone who feels like their voice doesn't match their message.

**Presence is about WHERE your attention goes**

Attractive people seem fully present. They're not mentally elsewhere. They're not scanning the room for something better.

This is the hardest part honestly. Our brains are trained for constant distraction now. But when you give someone full attention, even for 30 seconds, they feel it. And they remember you.

I started practicing with the app Insight Timer. Just 5 minute daily meditations focused on present moment awareness. Not trying to be zen or whatever. Just training my brain to actually BE where I am. The meditation library is insane, completely free, and better than other apps I tried.

**The authenticity paradox**

Here's the mind fuck: you can't fake presence. People's mirror neurons pick up on incongruence immediately. If you're using ""confident"" body language but feeling anxious inside, it reads as creepy or try-hard.

The real work is internal. Addressing why you feel the need to shrink yourself. Why you're anxious in social situations. What stories you tell yourself about your worth.

The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle helped me here. Yeah it's spiritual and sometimes out there, but the core concept about being trapped in your mental narratives is solid. Tolle has this way of explaining how we create suffering by living in our heads instead of reality. Won an Oprah co-sign for good reason. Insanely good read that completely shifted how I show up in spaces.

If you want to go deeper on this stuff but don't have the energy to read through dense psychology books or figure out where to start, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) has been useful. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews on topics like attraction psychology, body language, and communication. 

You type in something specific like ""become more magnetically attractive as an introvert who struggles with anxiety in social settings"" and it creates an adaptive learning plan and generates audio podcasts tailored to your exact situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google folks. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I use the smoky one that sounds like Samantha from Her during commutes. Makes learning feel less like work and more like having a conversation with someone who gets what you're trying to figure out.

Look, this isn't quick fix stuff. I'm a year in and still catch myself shrinking or fidgeting when I'm nervous. But the baseline shift is real. People respond to me differently in meetings, social situations, even just ordering coffee.

Your presence should communicate what you don't need to say out loud: that you're comfortable in your skin, that you belong in the space you're in, that you're not apologizing for existing.

That's the attraction nobody talks about. Not looks. Not status. Just the quiet confidence of someone who isn't fighting themselves anymore.",1,1770733890.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False
1r129st,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r129st/what_happens_to_your_brain_when_you_quit_social/,What Happens to Your BRAIN When You Quit Social Media (Science-Based Breakdown),"So I fell into this rabbit hole researching why quitting Instagram felt harder than quitting coffee. Turns out, there's actual neuroscience behind this, not just weakness or lack of discipline. Your brain literally rewires itself around these apps, and when you pull the plug, shit gets weird.

I've been studying this through research papers, podcasts, and books because I was sick of the ""just delete the apps"" advice that completely ignores what's happening in your skull. Here's what I found.

**1. Your dopamine system is basically hijacked**

Social media companies employ literal neuroscientists to make their platforms addictive. Every notification, like, and comment triggers dopamine release, the same chemical involved in gambling and substance addiction. The intermittent reinforcement (you never know when you'll get that dopamine hit) makes it especially potent.

When you quit, your brain freaks out because it's used to those regular dopamine spikes. You get restless, anxious, even depressed. This isn't weakness, it's your neurochemistry adjusting. The good news? Your dopamine receptors can recover, but it takes time. Usually 2-4 weeks before the intense cravings ease up.

Dr. Anna Lembke's book [*Dopamine Nation*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55723020-dopamine-nation) (she's the chief of Stanford Addiction Medicine) destroys everything you think you know about pleasure and pain. She explains how our brains maintain balance, and how constant dopamine hits from social media throw that balance completely off. This book will make you question every scroll. She uses patient stories to show how digital addictions are processed identically to drug addictions in the brain. Insanely good read that actually changed how I view my phone.

**2. The first 72 hours are genuinely brutal**

Research shows the acute withdrawal phase peaks around day 3. You'll experience FOMO on steroids, phantom vibrations, compulsive checking of the app icon that's no longer there. Your brain is literally searching for its fix.

One study from the University of Bath found that one week off social media significantly reduced anxiety and depression, but participants reported the first few days as extremely difficult. They felt disconnected, bored, and irritable.

Practical tip: replace the behavior, don't just delete it. When you feel the urge to scroll, have a specific alternative ready. Could be a 2 minute breathing exercise, a physical book, or the Finch app (genuinely helps with building new habits through a cute virtual pet system, way less cringe than it sounds).

**3. Your sense of self gets destabilized**

Here's the part nobody talks about. Social media doesn't just give you dopamine hits, it literally shapes your identity. You curate a version of yourself, you get validation for certain types of content, you start performing your life rather than living it.

When you quit, you suddenly have to figure out who you are without an audience. It's disorienting as hell. You'll catch yourself thinking ""this would make a good post"" then remember you're not posting anymore. That cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable but necessary for reclaiming authentic experiences.

Cal Newport's *Digital Minimalism* breaks down why our brains weren't built for constant connection. He's a Georgetown computer science professor who's never had social media, and he provides a framework for intentional technology use. The book won WSJ and NYT praise for a reason. It includes a 30 day digital declutter process that actually works, unlike the cold turkey approaches that fail 90% of the time.

Another resource worth checking out is [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app from Columbia alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from research papers, expert insights, and books on behavioral psychology to create personalized audio content about breaking digital habits and building better ones. You can set your specific goal (like reducing screen time or improving focus) and it generates an adaptive learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives. The depth customization is useful when dealing with the restlessness that comes with quitting, you can adjust based on your attention span that day.

**4. Boredom becomes your superpower**

Social media eliminated boredom from our lives. Every spare second, we scroll. But boredom is actually when your brain does its best creative work, processes emotions, and consolidates memories.

The withdrawal period forces you to sit with boredom, and it's excruciating at first. But this is where the magic happens. Your brain starts generating ideas again. You actually daydream. You process experiences instead of immediately photographing them.

[Dr. Manoush Zomorodi's](https://www.manoushz.com/) podcast *Note to Self* (now called *ZigZag*) did an entire series called ""Bored and Brilliant"" exploring this. She presents research showing that boredom activates the default mode network, the part of your brain responsible for creativity and self-reflection. Worth listening to the whole series.

**5. Your attention span actually recovers**

Studies show heavy social media use literally shortens attention spans and reduces ability to focus deeply. The constant context switching (scrolling from topic to topic) trains your brain to expect novelty every few seconds.

When you quit, you'll notice you can't focus on long-form content at first. Books feel impossible. Movies feel slow. This improves gradually. Around week 3 or 4, most people report being able to focus for longer periods without that itchy need to check something.

The Ash app is solid for this transition period if you're dealing with the anxiety that comes up. It's like having a relationship coach/therapist that helps you work through the emotional stuff that surfaces when you're not numbing out with scrolls.

**6. Social connection becomes real again**

Ironic that ""social"" media makes us less social. Research from the University of Pennsylvania found that limiting social media to 30 minutes per day led to significant reductions in loneliness.

When you quit, you'll initially feel more isolated because you're missing the illusion of connection. But then something shifts. You start texting people directly. Making actual plans. Having conversations that aren't performed for an audience.

This feels awkward after years of curated interaction, but it's also deeply satisfying in a way scrolling never was. Your brain starts getting social fulfillment from actual human connection instead of the synthetic version.

**7. The urge never fully disappears, but it gets manageable**

Even after months, you'll still get occasional strong urges to reinstall. Usually triggered by stress, loneliness, or habit cues (sitting on the toilet, waiting in line, etc).

The difference is after the neurochemical adjustment period, these urges don't control you. They're just thoughts that pass. You notice them, acknowledge them, and move on.

The key is having systems in place for those moments. Keep your phone in another room at night. Use app blockers. Have replacement activities ready. Don't rely on willpower alone because willpower is finite and these apps are designed by teams of engineers to break it.

**The bottom line**: Your brain doesn't just ""miss"" social media when you quit. It goes through actual withdrawal because these platforms have literally altered your neurochemistry. The discomfort you feel is real, biological, and temporary. Your brain is remarkably plastic and will adapt. But you need to understand what's happening and have strategies beyond ""just be stronger.""

It gets easier. Your brain heals. You remember what it's like to be present. But those first few weeks are rough, and knowing why makes them slightly more bearable.",3,1770733869.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Total bullshit. After going down a rabbit hole of behavioral psychology, evolutionary biology, and honestly just observing people who naturally draw others in, I realized something wild: attraction is about how you think, not just how you look.

I spent months digging through research papers, podcasts with psychologists, and books by people who actually study human behavior (not dating gurus selling courses). The pattern became clear. Attractive people operate with different mental models. They process situations differently. They make decisions differently. And the crazy part? You can learn these frameworks.

This isn't about manipulation or being someone you're not. It's about rewiring the operating system in your head that's been holding you back. Most of us are running on default settings programmed by anxious parents, shitty high school experiences, and Instagram's distorted reality. Time to upgrade.

## Step 1: Stop Optimizing for Everyone's Approval

The most attractive people I know don't give a fuck about being universally liked. They have strong opinions. They polarize. They're okay with 30% of people not vibing with them because the other 70% are obsessed.

Mental model here: Subtraction, not addition. Stop trying to add more qualities people might like. Start subtracting the fake shit you do for approval. Say what you actually think. Dress how you want. Pursue your weird hobbies.

Charlie Munger calls this ""inversion thinking."" Instead of asking ""what makes me attractive?"" ask ""what makes me repulsive?"" Usually, it's neediness, trying too hard, shapeshifting for different audiences.

Read [""The Courage to Be Disliked""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked) by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. This book is based on Adlerian psychology and will slap you in the face with the truth that seeking approval is the root of all your social anxiety. The authors are Japanese philosophers who break down why we're so desperate for validation and how that desperation is literally what makes us unattractive. After finishing this, I stopped apologizing for my existence in conversations. Legitimately changed how I show up. Best book on social psychology I've ever touched.

## Step 2: Develop Genuine Curiosity (Not Small Talk)

Attractive people ask better questions. They're genuinely interested in understanding you, not just waiting for their turn to talk. This isn't some technique, it's a mental model shift.

Framework: Think like an anthropologist, not a salesperson. You're studying humans because they're fascinating, not because you need something from them.

Listen to conversations that make you feel seen. That's the energy you want to create. When someone talks to you, they should feel like the most interesting person in the room for those five minutes.

## Step 3: Master the Risk/Reward Mental Model

Here's what separates attractive people from everyone else: they're comfortable with social risk. They'll say the slightly awkward thing. They'll be vulnerable first. They'll make the move.

Most people operate from a scarcity mindset. ""What if this person rejects me and I never find anyone else?"" Attractive people operate from abundance. ""If this doesn't work out, there are literally millions of other humans.""

Mental model: Expected value calculation. The potential upside of taking social risks (deep connections, romantic opportunities, memorable experiences) massively outweighs the downside (brief awkwardness, someone says no). Yet most people avoid all risk.

Check out [""Thinking in Bets""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets) by Annie Duke. She's a former professional poker player and cognitive psychologist. The book teaches you to think probabilistically about decisions instead of in absolutes. When you realize that being rejected isn't a catastrophic failure but just one outcome with a certain probability, you stop being so fucking scared all the time. Applied this to dating and social situations, total game changer.

## Step 4: Build Your Personal Monopoly

No one's attracted to generic. You need to be exceptionally good or knowledgeable about something. Doesn't matter what. Coffee roasting. Ancient history. Woodworking. Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

Mental model: The Purple Cow principle from Seth Godin. In a field of brown cows, the purple one gets noticed. Stop being a brown cow trying to be slightly browner.

Depth beats breadth. Being kind of interested in ten things makes you forgettable. Being obsessively into one or two things makes you magnetic.

## Step 5: Understand Status Games (Without Playing Them)

Here's uncomfortable truth: humans are status-conscious primates. But attractive people understand status dynamics without being enslaved to them.

Mental model: Two types of status games. Finite games (win/lose, someone has to be on top) and infinite games (everyone can win, the goal is to keep playing). Unattractive behavior is constantly trying to one-up people, name-drop, peacock. Attractive behavior is being secure enough that you can make others look good.

Read [""The Status Game""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58642436-the-status-game) by Will Storr. This book is insanely good. Storr is a journalist who breaks down how status-seeking behavior drives basically everything humans do. Understanding this made me stop doing cringey shit like humble-bragging or getting defensive when someone knew more than me about something. You'll see status games everywhere after this, and once you see them, you stop unconsciously playing them.

## Step 6: Adopt an Ownership Mindset

Victims are unattractive. Full stop. Doesn't matter if life actually screwed you over. The mental model of ""everything is my fault and my responsibility"" is weirdly magnetic.

Framework: Extreme ownership (yeah, from Jocko Willink). When something goes wrong, your first instinct should be ""how did I contribute to this?"" Not in a self-flagellation way, but in an empowerment way. You can only fix what you own.

This shows up in attraction immediately. ""My ex was crazy"" makes you sound like a victim. ""I ignored red flags because I was afraid of being alone"" makes you sound self-aware and growth-oriented.

## Step 7: Develop Antifragile Confidence

Confidence isn't believing you'll succeed. That's delusion. Real confidence is knowing you'll be okay if you fail.

Mental model: Antifragility from Nassim Taleb. Systems that get stronger from stress and volatility. Your ego should work the same way. Each rejection, each embarrassing moment, each failure should make you slightly more resilient.

Read [""Antifragile""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. This book will rewire how you think about setbacks. Taleb is a former trader and philosopher who shows how some things benefit from chaos and stress. Applied to personal development, it means actively seeking situations that might humble you because that's how you build real confidence. After reading this, I started viewing social ""failures"" as deposits into my confidence bank account. Difficult read but worth it.

## Step 8: Practice Premortem Thinking

Anxiety kills attraction. You know what kills anxiety? Planning for worst-case scenarios until they're not scary anymore.

Mental model: Premortem analysis. Before any social situation, imagine it going terribly. Then imagine how you'd handle it. ""What if I say something awkward?"" Cool, I'll laugh and own it. ""What if they're not into me?"" I'll be slightly disappointed for 20 minutes then move on.

This isn't pessimism, it's preparation. And preparation creates calm. Calm is attractive.

## Step 9: Understand Opportunity Cost

Every hour you spend doom-scrolling or in your comfort zone is an hour you didn't spend becoming more interesting, skilled, or connected.

Mental model: Opportunity cost. Every choice has a hidden cost which is whatever you didn't choose. Staying in on Friday night costs you potential experiences and connections. Staying in a dead-end relationship costs you the possibility of finding someone better matched.

Attractive people are ruthless about cutting things that don't serve them because they understand this tradeoff viscerally.

If you want to go deeper on these concepts but don't have time to read everything, there's a personalized learning app called [**BeFreed**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from books like the ones I mentioned, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio learning plans. You can set specific goals like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" or ""improve social confidence,"" and it generates a structured plan pulling from psychology research and relationship experts. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. Built by Columbia grads and former Google experts, it's like having a pocket learning coach. The voice options are genuinely addictive, I use the smoky voice that sounds like Samantha from Her. Makes the commute way more productive than doom-scrolling.

## Step 10: Master the Long Game

Attraction isn't a sprint. You're not going to read this post and become irresistible tomorrow. You're building a foundation.

Mental model: Compound interest applied to personal development. Small improvements stack. Being 1% better at conversation every week compounds into being transformatively better in a year.

Read [""Atomic Habits""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) by James Clear. This book is everywhere for a reason. Clear breaks down the science of habit formation and shows you how tiny changes create remarkable results over time. The identity-based approach (becoming the type of person who X) is especially powerful for attractiveness because you're not faking behaviors, you're actually changing who you are. Read this if you haven't already.

The wildest thing about mental models is they work invisibly. You start making better decisions without consciously thinking about it. You start showing up differently in conversations. People start leaning in when you talk instead of checking their phones.

None of this is rocket science. But it does require actually implementing these frameworks instead of just nodding along and doing nothing. The gap between knowing and doing is where most people live their entire lives.

You already have everything you need to be attractive. You just need better software running in your head.",2,1770733625.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

I’ve recently been feeling extremely lonely with my long term bf of 10 years. I’ve had a few stressful weeks due to a lot of work pressure, pressure at home and financial hardships.

My partner and I’s anniversary had passed at which I got upset at since he didn’t really talk about how much of a milestone it was (being 10 years), I don’t think I really wanted a big celebration anyways because I don’t think I can afford it but I just wanted him to talk about it and think about how far we have come as a couple.

He didn’t do that and had a sports event the weekend of our anniversary, which is fine. I got really upset over the phone at the fact he didn’t even talk about our anniversary at all and started crying because I felt unseen and he blamed it on me, saying that I always get upset at him going to his sports events. I explained how that is not true and all I was upset about was that he didn’t seem to really care about our anniversary. He didn’t listen and dismissed me getting really mad and defensive over the phone. I had to cut the call but still texted him as I didn’t want my voice to be unheard. He still dismissed my long texts with an “ok” at which I felt even more upset at and ended up saying that I don’t want to talk to him at all over the weekend as I’m not feeling good about this. He kept texting me anyways and I ignored it because he was acting as if nothing happened. Then on Monday night he called me to wish me happy anniversary as our anni was on Tuesday (why I didn’t want to celebrate it on Tuesday was due to work pressure) I also wished him and he apologised and said he understood why I was upset and he will try to make it up to me. He made a really cute post for our anniversary. I got happy at this and was then okay. We went to get frozen yoghurt on our anniversary and it still felt special and good.

Following the next weekend he told me he’s going to one of his ex colleagues birthday parties (who was a girl) again I got a bit upset at this because it feels like he doesn’t really like to plan any dinners etc with me but is happy going to someone’s birthday? Also because it’s a girl I felt somewhat weird since it was a family event and I didn’t realise they are that close. I let him know that it’s interesting he doesn’t keep in contact with any of his ex male colleagues from work - to which he got angry and said that he feels scared to be honest to me and he should have just lied instead. So I just stayed silent and tried to be normal. Again I didn’t really feel like talking to him all weekend just because I felt unheard so I avoided having a conversation with him. He called me again on Monday which I answered and expressed my feelings again. He apologised again and I thought I can’t be bothered feeling upset about this when I have so many other things to worry about so I let it go and realised it’s not really that big of a deal that he went to her birthday I was mostly just feeling sad and lonely myself.

I have a lot of work to do at my workplace and it’s coming time for performance reviews and I feel like I’m slowly losing it. Today I went to meet him for the gym because I feel like the gym is the only place that is making me feel mentally strong and stable at this point in my life to which he said he is too tired and wants to grab a coffee instead. I was happy about grabbing a coffee but he put music on in my car very loudly despite me saying I wasn’t in the mood, I could barely talk over the music. He was also talking about his work which I gave minimal responses to because I was focused on driving. He then kept on asking me a lot of questions about my work, financial hardships etc and I felt mostly really overwhelmed because he knows I’m going through a hard time and it felt like he didn’t quite grasp that and was trying to make jokes out of it - not in a bad way, but in the hopes to make me laugh. I just feel like this is a really serious time in my life and he’s not really able to understand that. I wish he would not nonchalantly ask me about these heavy topics and understand it needs proper care. I know it’s not like I’m dying or something but I’ve expressed to him many times how stressed out I’ve been. For some reason all the questioning, music, his nonchalant behavior and driving made me feel super overstimulated to which I kind of just started crying while driving. He was super confused and unfortunately I wasn’t able to  stop crying at all and felt like I was having some sort of breakdown. I stopped at the coffee shop and expressed I was feeling physically ill and needed to go back home. He started to make “knock knock” jokes when I was pretty much crying a lot. It made me feel a lot worse. He then proceeded to say I was always mad at him about something and he didn’t really hug me or anything. I cried even more at that because i felt so helpless, like I needed to take care of him and reassure him at a point where it was hard to take care of myself. He offered to drive me back home in my car but I declined because I was still okay to drive after drinking some water and stopping for a bit. I let him know if he feels unsafe he should catch an uber back home or I can drop him whatever he wants. He wanted me to drop him so I did.

As he was leaving he did ask me what’s wrong and if I’m okay and I said I don’t really feel okay and I don’t feel like I’m in the space to talk right now as I don’t think he will understand and just want to go home. He still sat with me for a while and tried to ask me what’s wrong a few times and he felt it was something he said or did. and I told him I wasn’t mad at him just feeling really anxious about life and feeling like a lot of things are going out of my control but I know I’ll be okay. I was then feeling a bit better and he went home and made sure I shared my location with him so he could see when I got home.

I am not sure why but I feel so distant from him and alone like I can’t really talk to him about anything. When I got home he didn’t even text me or call me about it. It makes me feel like not talking to him again for a few days and avoiding him because I feel like he doesn’t get me.

So am I insane for feeling this way? ",1,1770733563.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I’m on a 1200 calorie diet. I’ve been at it for about a year and lost 165 pounds. I have another 50-60 to go. I usually eat nothing during the day, or maybe two eggs during the daytime, along with coffee (with half & half) and a lot of water, plus my fiber pills. It’s usually 100-300 calories.

Then for dinner I’ll often have a high protein (and low carb) meal that’s 900-1100 calories, and it’s very filling. I usually eat around 6 pm and in bed by 9 or 10. 

I’ve been losing very consistently but I’m wondering if this might be bad for my metabolism long term (I hope not) or if there are other reasons I should eat more throughout the day. Personally, I like it this way and suspect that’s the answer right there. But I’ve seen some posts about how eating a big meal at night is a bad idea. Thank you for any insights!

The mask arrived a few days later.

I was working late one night, feeling totally burnt out.

I decided to try it on, just for a laugh.

When I put it on, it was like everything else just faded away.

The weight of the mask, the strange texture, it was all so consuming.

I was able to focus on my work in a way I hadn't before.

It was the strangest feeling, but it worked.

Now, when I get really stressed with my studies, I sometimes put on the mask for a little while.

It's become my weird little ritual.

It helps me disconnect from the chaos and find a moment of quiet.

It's not about being scary; it's about finding a strange kind of calm.

But at some point, the returns flatlined. I was spending more time prepping than actually talking to prospects. Sometimes the ‘perfect’ data just delayed me from sending any message at all. It felt like analysis paralysis, and honestly, it was a bit frustrating.

That’s when I decided to switch gears and focus on getting something out there quickly, even if it wasn’t perfectly tailored. I tested shorter research windows, sometimes just 10 minutes, and then crafted messages based on what I knew from headlines or recent news. Interestingly, I started seeing more responses because I was actually reaching people more often.

The lesson? More research isn’t always better. Especially in outbound, where relevance is critical but so is volume and momentum. It’s like there’s a sweet spot, the minimal amount of research to personalise enough to stand out, but not so much that you stall your whole outreach.

Has anyone else struggled with this? Where’s your line between enough prep and just hitting send? Would love to hear how you balance research and action in your outbound efforts.",1,1770733348.0,EmailProspecting,0,1.0,False
1r1210x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1r1210x/my_morning/,My morning,"My alarm went off at 7 AM. To be honest I did not actually get out of bed until 7:20. The floor was really cold so I spent some time looking for my socks. I was looking for my socks because my floor was freezing.



I woke up. The first thing I did was splash some cold water on my face to wake up. The cold water really helped me feel more awake. I used way much moisturizer on my face because the winter air is really dry and it is making my skin feel dry.



Then I did the things I usually do every day. I brushed my teeth. I was looking at TikTok on my phone at the same time. I know this is a habit. After that I put on the sweater that I own because I was feeling cold. The winter air is making me feel really cold so I needed a sweater.



I finally made it to the kitchen for some coffee. The coffee is what I really need now. There is something peaceful about watching the gray Warsaw sky while the kettle boils. I like the Warsaw sky because it is so calm. Now I am just sitting here wrapped in a blanket trying to convince myself that going out into the cold for my 9 AM lecture, at the university is an idea. I do not want to go to the 9 AM lecture because it is cold outside. The coffee and the blanket make me want to stay in the kitchen.

We finally have native 2K resolution and text rendering that doesn't look like a total fever dream. 

I did a quick test on its editing capabilities:
bash
# Running the 7B version locally
ollama run qwen-image:2.0-7b ""Add a neon sign saying 'AITools' to this coffee shop image""

The fact that a 7B model can handle generation and editing in a single pass is wild. The text rendering is actually legible, which usually requires a much larger parameter count. 

On the API side, **Arcee AI's Trinity Large Preview** is currently **free** ($0.00/M) on OpenRouter. I’ve been throwing some RAG tasks at it, and while it's a preview, the 131k context is holding up surprisingly well for zero cost. Meanwhile, OpenAI quietly bumped **GPT-4.1 Mini** to a **1,047,576 context window** for **$0.40/M**. It’s clear that ""context wars"" are the new ""price wars.""

Are you guys seeing consistent text rendering with the new **Qwen** weights? And is anyone actually using the full million-token window on the **4.1 Mini** yet, or is it still mostly marketing fluff at this point?",1,1770733282.0,AIToolsPerformance,0,1.0,False

# Lapse in Judgment

*****

Somewhere amidst the storm of communiques, radio signals and ship signals, an audio signal snaked through, a preset, preplanned moment of privacy. A cherished rarity for both of the participants.

The handshake between the systems was done quickly- and quietly. A quiet add-on. Audio-only, code names. A young man like him was expected to have dalliances, of course. A certain amount of discretion to run things as he saw fit, and as was only just. But this clandestine sort of arrangement was far more fun. Direct reports, from someone of her station? It was scintillating.

Now he awaited the response after a full day of briefings.

“As I see it,” the woman said, voice playful. “The Empire needs to show that it is strong. Make it unequivocal that you are on their side. A demonstration that you are, in fact, taking this as seriously as a matter of Life and Death.”

“And how do I do that?” He wanted so badly to not seem like an overeager schoolboy, but he'd blown it. Or, had he? With the delay between them, surely she wouldn't have noticed how he'd jumped.

“It must be personal,” she recommended, voice insistent.

He sat back in his ornate chair. *Personal?*

“How can I make something...personal?” He'd never done that in his life. His whole station depended on being reserved, keeping distant- and then he understood, before she'd even answered. Of course, that was why he'd have to be the one to act!

“You have a prisoner aboard, I understand. Some distant niece. An uninvolved, sweet little thing. A shame she has the same last name.”

“She was caught trying to flee,” he answered sternly, face focused with a ferocity that was only skin-deep. “In these situations, only those involved flee instead of turning out their guilty relatives.”

A smile flashed, hidden quickly though the signal could never carry it through more than tone. “Yes, that is usually the case. They flee the scene first, to wherever they think they are safe. Where they have friends, and powerful allies. Corruption always forms a terrible tangle. Ripping it free often takes many interconnected, otherwise useful strands.”

“I admire you,” he admitted suddenly. “You came from nothing.”

“Not nothing,” she countered. “We all come from somewhere.”

“Still, no noble name, and now look at you. I despair at being born so high and left with nothing to achieve. Historians will lament me. Whatever struggles come in the future, no matter how distant, I will be held in contempt for not addressing them quickly enough, unless I act *now,* before the problems grow more serious.”

“You must act boldly, swiftly, as suits you,” the voice agreed after a few seconds’ pause, the lag between responses a necessity. “You are in-system, and yet hardly a soul down there knows it, let alone recognizes the significance. You could quell the rebellion overnight. Appease them. Slake the burning New York. Stop the Spanish resistance, shock the French protests dead with something sufficiently shocking. Don’t just declare your authority, make it unmistakable to all in the system. Whatever you choose, you must act quickly. Even Africa is showing signs of dangerous instability, though their Governesses are loath to admit such.”

“Yes, I read that the suspicion for why lies with the reunification program. Sending people from dangerous areas to safe ones seems to instead just contaminate them with mistaken ideas of what we are like.”

“Ones you could correct with an adequate demonstration. I leave what you do up to you, though.”

He wanted to point out that some zones, like Pennsylvania, were seeing overall crime decreases. But did he dare trust the reports he was being given, or did he trust the one who had been here and was in a position to know?

*Be decisive.* His hand gripped. ""I know what I have to do.""

# Two Drifters in the Night

I was happy to say that the ‘canoe’ did indeed float. Oh, sure, it didn’t seem to want to float straight, and the ‘paddles’ were more useful to use like a gondola pole, pushing us away from obstacles or dislodging us when we got stuck, even dragging in the back to keep the front pointed forward. But despite all its flaws, we’d been managing.

We’d successfully pulled it out and carried it along the riverbank past the rapids, where all the old dams had been shattered, then gone tumbling over the one remaining dam at Hagley. We’d snuck past Bancroft base just before the sun rose, all without a major, run-ending incident. 

Even if it was decidedly unstable and we’d tipped at least a dozen times, we were making decent progress. On the most recent tip-over, an old streetlight finally revealed the results to Natalie.

“Ick,” she remarked, looking at me with a crinkled lip. The latest spill-over had sent me into a mucky algae bloom, all down my front and all over my face. It seemed the river cleanup still had some ways to go, a delay in their environmental work where I could admit to some fault, at least. *Hoisted by my own petard…*

“Yeah, I bet it’s the ideal image of ‘romantic, human boyfriend’ that propels so many ships to our shores,” I managed. Despite the hour, I was too excited to be sleepy, and too exhausted by the currents and efforts to feel refreshed.

“Aren’t you at all worried about your image, your appearance, if someone sees us?”

“I was covered with acne wearing rags to school. Do you think a little mud in the great outdoors bothers me to where I’m going to stop?” I managed to climb in and held the boat fast against a stone that jutted up. “Besides, I can shower off.”

“It’s more than ‘a little.’”

I supposed I more resembled a scooby doo sea monster than anything else, so after helping her guide the watercraft toward the feed-in for the canal, I tossed both our bags over the side, then bailed out, which of course upended the small craft.

“Elias!” Natalie shrieked as she flailed right before being plunged into the cool channel.

“What?” I managed before laughing. Face screwed up in a scowl, she splashed me, only for me to splash her right back. For a few seconds, we ignored the upended craft and wasted what precious energy our tired and battered bodies had, before I climbed back out and held the canoe still against the water’s stream. Natalie pulled herself out, grabbed our thoroughly soaked bags before dumping them back in yet again. “At least this time it was on purpose.”

“Yeah, for one of us,” Despite the tone of her words she didn’t seem to actually be in bad spirits. How could we be, when we were almost to the end?

The alien suit I wore was even somewhat waterproof and sensation-dulling, but I still felt the cool water dripping down my exposed neck and head. All-in-all, a rather strange sensation. *Talk about a non-breatheable material. I suppose it’d have to be if this is meant to be vacuum-proof.*

“You can get me back,” I promised, trying to not capsize the logflume-canoe-paddleboard-gondola-kayak. Whatever term one wanted to call it, it performed poorly at all of those tasks. And yet, we’d made it practically to the bottom of the Brandywine.

I took a brief moment to enjoy the early morning view along the canal

 

“Hey, I recognize this place,” she muttered.

“Yeah, it’s where I got Morsh with the knife, remember?”

“I do.”

“I was meaning to ask about that. I’m pretty sure she took it easy on us.”

“She did. I found out later.”

Ah. At least Natalie hadn’t been in on it. Whatever cloud of hurt feelings I might have had were dispelled.

“Never told you this, but I was actually coming here on my way back home from Warehouse Base. I think she wanted to teach us a lesson.”

“A lesson on what? Boys not being out on their own, blah blah, ‘how dangerous it is out here’?” I chuckled darkly. “You wouldn’t believe the talking-tos I get from Amilita. She never lets up. If only they knew who they were talking to, right?”

“That won’t matter much in a week or so,” she said. “You’ll be away from your base of support.”

“I know.” I’d certainly worried about it enough, even without a proper cause to.

“And you can’t just stab people and fix your problems.”

It felt petty to ask her about duelling. “You sure?” I asked, slowly. “I mean, it’s what we’ve been doing for a couple years now, and that’s only following on for most of human history. And now the state’s at peace. Most of our immediate problems are handled.”

“You didn’t stab anyone to get rid of the mind-wipers, and they’re gone. Azraea banned them back when she was Governess-General.”

I had to concede this was technically true, though I’d certainly made the point to Amilita and any Shil’vati who would listen that it was driving our ‘go and stab people to solve problems’ recruitment through the roof. So, in an indirect way, stabbing our enemies had played a part. Hell, Azraea was only Governess-General because of stabbing, it was getting harder and harder to avoid her as a topic. If they’d thought we were all-talk, I doubt they’d have jumped to their feet like that. While I was sure Amilita would have advocated for its ban, even if we weren’t a clear and present danger to the Shil’vati’s continued governance, I wasn’t so sure about the rest of them.

“Guess so.”

There was motion ahead, and the steady fall of someone’s sneakers echoing through the pedestrian tunnel ahead, and a long shadow bobbing as it grew longer from its sole light.

“Shit. We’ve got company. Alright, let’s get this thing out of the canal and back down to the river. We’re past the rocks.”

Natalie helped me paddle it to the side, throwing our still dripping equipment bags ashore once more.

Up came the boat with a heave and a grunt. This thing was *not* lightweight by any stretch. My fingers found a spot where I’d cut deeper than the rest and could gain purchase, and together we marched it toward the river, clumsy and discordant across the road and up to the stone wall. I felt like cursing every step of the way, but bit my bottom lip instead. I hopped over first, my feet clearing in a parkour clear while Natalie’s shaky arms held it overhead. I still almost failed as the new boots caught the rock and didn’t flex or grip in quite the way I thought they should. We slowly exchanged who was holding it. My girlfriend climbed over slowly and carefully, mindful of the jagged rough-cut stones jutting up from the wall’s mortar.

“Come on.” I navigated the couple feet down to the embankment. Subtle, we weren’t, and we might’ve even been seen by the jogger, but I might have managed an ambush with a knife had this been ‘real’.

Either way, we were cutting things close. The city would be waking up soon, and with the sun now actually up and the last stars overhead disappeared in the purple-pink hue, we didn’t have much time left.

I waded into the rushing depths, then set the canoe down and walked it forward before jumping in. Natalie threw our bags in and followed a moment later, and she began steering us around a rock that loomed ahead.

Whatever inexpertise she might have had on land she made up for in the water. Even on an alien planet, on a terrible handmade canoe that barely floated, she found a way to navigate us with a relative skill I admired, until the current began slowing as we came up to the confluence of rivers. “What’s our time?” I asked.

She checked her wrist-omni, a staple for officers and military. Some sort of shrunken interface that mine didn't have. “We’re on schedule. The tide is switching from high to low soon.”

Perfect. The wind was still, occasional morning gusts aside, and we had cleared the city’s most populated area to make it toward the industrial sector.

*Only one more obstacle. Remember to make a left, instead of a right.*

I’d just have to take a few minutes, though.

“Rest our arms,” I ordered. “We’re going to need our strength.” The ‘paddles’ we had, frankly, were terrible. Our arms were already tiring from building the camp, canoe, and then trying to steer our way down whenever the water’s flow tried misguiding us.

I pulled mine into my lap and lay back, watching the cloudless sky.

“Elias?” Natalie asked.

“Hm?” I opened my eyes, disrupted from my pleasant daydream of Natalie joining me by leaning back across it.

“There’s someone on the bridge. They’re watching us.”

“Shit. I guess if this was a military exercise, we just failed.” Maybe we’d have managed, and even won a laspistol duel, but it would have brought company. *Scenario over, we failed, most likely.*

Still, something about the way she said it indicated a degree of anxiety beyond us failing, so I shuffled up to my elbows, and sure enough there was someone staring right down at us, ignoring the cat sitting beside him on the broad, crumbled concrete railing. Almost like he was keeping watch. In fact, I was sure of it. I’d done enough site inspections to spot a sentry. And given how close we were to Warehouse Base, I had a pretty good idea of who he was watching passers-by for.

Even if I was mistaken and there was a reasonable chance he just disapproved of what he was seeing, the question was: What, if anything, would he do about it?

I dug into my bag and held up the laminated passes I’d strapped to my forearm in preparation for being intercepted at Bancroft Base. I doubted the one watching us would be able to verify from where he stood, but he should get the idea from the bright colored paper, shouldn’t he?

I’d made sure to train everyone, and I meant *everyone* on how to keep the hard-fought peace intact. I’d warned them that the Shil’vati would doubtless try and trick us into violating its terms, and stressed that equally important to fighting for more elsewhere in America, would be keeping what we’d gained here.

Then again, while in the capital of Dover next to the Shil’vati garrison it was likely pretty common to see Human/Shil’vati pairings in public, that was a good hour’s drive from here. This city had seen the most violent clashes in the state, block-by-block fighting. The orbital strikes on Camp Death had rattled windows and walls downtown, all of it visible as people prepared for The End of All Things and felt vindicated. Panic had set in. Only the sudden and violent destruction of the Governess in one cataclysmic blast had spared them, or so the narrative we spun went.

As a result, the places where humans and Shil’vati tended to interact around were extremely limited in their scope and purpose. A few friendly bars and businesses, personal and private dwellings in the night, and little else. Certainly not…whatever he might have thought *this* was.

He disappeared from the bridge’s edge, but the cat stayed a second longer, tail swishing back and forth as bright green eyes stared down, squinting into the rising sun. At least no chunks of pale concrete came sailing down to punch a hole clean through, and I let out a sigh after we made it across to the other side.

“Should we paddle?” Natalie asked nervously.

“I don’t know.” The idea of being caught out in the open water by whatever he managed to rustle up sounded un-ideal. Zero cover from railgun or rifle rounds, or any other way to escape any motorized pursuit, just as much. We could try and paddle ashore and hide up the bridge’s embankment and take our chances with the locals, or see if anyone would come. I doubted it’d make much of a difference, though. The current had slowed, sure, but it wasn’t exactly like we’d be able to make a huge difference with these shitty ‘paddles.’

Decision time.

“Rest our arms. Better we reach the bottom of the river and actually make it across than exhaust ourselves for nothing.”

I was determined to win this damn thing.

The river took a turn and the sun rose along the river, turning the water aflame in an orange glow as we entered the final oxbow. The abandoned factories and overgrowth gave me the illusion that things were, well, normal again. As long as I pretended my alien girlfriend was from a species that had always been a part of our [history, as some now lamely insisted they were](https://i.imgur.com/fKzY69b.png).

“Elias?” She asked. I rose very gently to peer over her shoulder. The final bridge was ahead, and there was a pair of masked figures joined by that sentry, who was pointing directly at us. Even the cat had apparently followed him, following his finger.

I squinted, tired from working on the canoe and putting on the finishing touches.

“Wait…”

“Hold!” The voice was high and clear- and had a buzz to it. A vocoder, and a rather distinctive one, at that. Though, I supposed it might have been one of a set.

*Could it be?*

A flash of red all but confirmed it.

“Take us to shore, and-” then I seized her forearm, almost tipping us over as I yanked it away from her free hand. “Don’t press the emergency button!”

“What?!” Natalie was on the verge of panic.

“If Morsh shows up, what’s the over-under on the peace surviving?” I asked. I needed to confirm. Besides, we might have a shot at stalling after pressing it, especially if we complied now.

But if Morsh showed up and saw armed insurgents? She’d be certain to open fire first and ask questions later.

“If you’re dead, if *we’re* dead, what’s the odds of the peace lasting?” I had to admit, it was probably ‘Not Very High’. “At least in the first one, we’re still alive!”

“Elias Sampson!” The voice barked out again. “Ashore! Now! You too, Natalie Rakten!”

“They know me?” My girlfriend asked, pausing in her struggle against my arm to stare forward in wonderment at the armed figures staring down at us.

“Isn’t it good to be famous?” I asked sarcastically, retrieving my paddle to stere us toward the muddy shore.

How was I going to get out of this? Certainly, the meeting was going to be ugly, either way.

I sighed as we pulled up to the embankment, and the two small familiar figures scurried down toward us, the same cat from the bridge following close in their footsteps. They dismissed the watcher, waving him off with a fist-over-heart, before turning to me.

“Where the hell have you two been?” I asked Binary and Hex as they stepped under the bridge to wait for me to finish paddling up to the embankment.

I started when both Twins pulled their masks off and said, in unison: “We’ve been waiting for you!” Their red hair spilled out from underneath their hastily donned outfits, eyes searching.

“What?” I was certainly not expecting that answer. “Since when?” And why had they pulled their masks off in front of an alien who might recognize them from Talay?

What was going on here?

“We went to the remembrance ceremony as soon as the evacuation order was lifted, but then we were just two more masked figures in attendance,” Hex said, her eyes flicking over to Natalie, who to my surprise was actually smiling at them in a way that seemed to be guided by genuine affection.

“There were even copycats of us,” Binary hissed unhappily. “Bad ones. It’s a One and F. One and F! On old hockey masks! How hard is that to keep straight?”

“I uh…” Natalie said slowly, starting to relax and even smile a little as it became clear there wasn’t going to be any danger. She turned to me, and somewhat sheepishly said: “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were even looking for them or that they were missing from your retinue. I would have told you, if you’d ever asked.”

Now the two looked a bit glum as I rounded back on them. “Alright. Spill. What’s going on? How does she know you?”

It made sense they knew her, but not the other way around.

“I overheard something in the hangar, enough to piece together the clues that they were close to you. I figured out you knew each other- but not who they were, at least, by their masked names.”

“That’s the point of them,” Hex remarked with a bit of a haughty tone.

“I thought the point was to hide that you were involved, as Holly. Not that you were Hex, specifically.” Natalie countered.

“What is going on?” I finally snapped. “You two already know- you knew she was in the insurgency?”

To my surprise, it was Hex who answered.

“We got busted staying on watch, because *someone* kept checking in with our mom.”

Binary looked sullen but unapologetic.

I looked back and forth between them. Both wilted at my gaze, neither willing to outright explain without my asking so I just sighed. “Okay, hold on, I’m lost. ‘Mom’?” I assumed it wasn’t the long-late Silver Fox, who’d gone down swinging after blowing up a bar in a rather biblical act of revenge over the twins’ dad sleeping with Shil’vati from a bar known for co-mingling. This had the rather selfish effect of orphaning her children. The astounding amount of anger she’d felt over the idea of Shil’vati/Human pairings had made me shiver at the idea of Hex and Natalie ever crossing paths.

Only now I was being informed that this dreaded meeting had apparently happened quite a long time ago. Not only had both survived the meeting, neither had even bothered to tell me! Stranger still, they seemed to hold no real animosity toward the other. I almost wanted to be mad, because it made no sense to me whatsoever.

I desperately looked over at Binary, and even she seemed unbothered.

Feeling overwhelmed, I shook my head. *Absorb information first. Process emotions later.*

The newly adopted Twins had been scooped up to the nearest naval vessel as part of Azraea’s evacuation order- which by necessity of targeting accuracy, was also the one bombarding us, with Natalie aboard it. By the time the Twins had gotten back to Earth, they’d found themselves cut out of the local networks, behind on too many code rotations for anything to check as valid. Then by the time they’d reached Delaware as visitors, their omni-pads still hadn’t been switched over to their new schools, something about the Data Teams being behind on their work.

So they’d tried finding us at all the usual hangouts. Vaughn was in Maryland with Gavin. Maize was with Miskatonic in Pennsylvania. George and Radio were off heading their own cells in other states. My whereabouts were, for my own safety and by design of a surprise inspection, always a closely-guarded secret.

As I heard them out and let Natalie explain our own situation, all I could imagine was that at least I wouldn’t be marching back to Gavin’s alone. Their addition was far from an army, but it was a start. And best of all, no one had any idea I had them back.

“Alright, what else?” Binary asked. “Do you need anything?”

“To get across the Delaware?” I asked. “Honestly, we could steal a water craft. Anything’s better than this thing,” I jerked a thumb over my shoulder.

[“Well,” Hex smirked. “The Kalmyr Nyckel is about a block from here.”](https://i.imgur.com/vUr8q3C.png)

She was my teacher from the age of 14 to when I left school/sixth form at 17. Our relationship was very close I would sit with her for lunch most days and majority of the time would sta after school to talk to her. I think I have a hard time moving on from this because the lines between our relationship were so blurred, she was never overly inappropriate towards me but me being young, possibly made me feel like there was something more.everyone knew how close we were, my friends and even teachers at school knew this and would make jokey comments about it.

She is married to a woman and would consistently tell me how much I reminded her of her wife etc.. I knew a lot about her personal life and that didn’t change once I left school. When I first left we followed eachother on social media and for about a year I didn’t hear from her again which I was fine with at the time I felt like I had moved on from that time in my life- but around this time last year she reached out again and we had a deep conversation about life and she kept telling me that “she would always be there for me she truly meant what she said”

After a couple weeks of us messaging back a forth( her sending me pictures of where she was on holiday and just general conversation) we met up for a coffee and spoke about life, at the time I was in a long term relationship with my girlfriend and was confiding in her about how I was unhappy, she kept telling me how I should end things in this relationship if I want happy- after this conversation she proceeded to send me quotes about tricky relationships and being there for yourself etc. i eventually ended things with my girlfriend and let her know but a couple months later we decided to get back together- she messaged me about this saying that she hadn’t been updated and that was the last time I heard from her. We had planned to meet up in the April of last year but when I sent a message asking if this was still happening I didn’t hear from her again.

I haven’t reached out since then but I am finding it really hard to let her go- I’ve tried to go to therapy to speak about this relationship but I don’t think I have the confidence to be truthfully honest about my feelings towards her. I don’t think she really understood how blurred the lines were at first and maybe she realised towards the end and that’s why she won’t speak to me anymore but I feel very left in the dark.",5,1770731968.0,LesbianActually,3,0.86,False

Helps a lot with light sensitivity but makes the nausea worse. I only take them when I have a particularly bad migraine that’s definitely much worse than the side effects. I’ve asked my GP about a gepant but shes hesitant to prescribe them (common Bri‘ish L)

Most of the time I just drink a fuckton of coffee and take some codeine-ibuprofen, which works a lot better than the triptans. 

What I’ve found is that nicotine works even better as a abortiv, just a few 4mg nicotine lozenges works better than caffeine and the codeine-ibuprofen together. Its also great that its so short-acting, because sometimes I mistakenly take too much caffeine or nicotine, thinking it’ll abort the migraine but actually making it worse, and with nicotine I have to suffer through that mistake for much less time than with caffeine 

The obvious problem is that nicotine is pretty addictive. I don’t vape or smoke because I don’t feel any effect from the nicotine, but the lozenges are a higher dose so they do give me a nice buzz which I like a bit too much. I keep some in my home for migraine purposes, but often get too tempted to start taking some when I don’t have a migraine and then briefly get addicted, quit, have to buy more for migrain reasons, go a few weeks being good only using them for migraines, get tempted, rinse and repeat. I really don’t want to use nicotine regularly because it gives me joint pain and I’m worried about the long-term osteoporosis risk, but I don’t want to give it up as a migraine treatment

Originally, they told me delivery would take about 4 weeks. Totally reasonable. I mentally prepared myself, rearranged my living room, and spent a month staring at an empty spot on the rug like a crazy person.

Week 4 came and went. Nothing.

I emailed and asked politely. They replied with photos of my actual table in progress, which somehow made it both better and worse. It existed. It was real. But it was not in my living room.

Then it became a pattern. Every weekend I’d check in, and they’d say it would be ready in about a week. Those a week somehow repeated themselves several times. At this point, I felt emotionally attached to a table I had never met.

Finally, around week 8, I got the FedEx tracking number. I probably refreshed that page more times than I’ve refreshed social media in my entire life. The morning it said “out for delivery,” I was useless as a human being. I didn’t leave the house. I didn’t make plans. I was ready.

FedEx even called me to confirm I was home to receive it. Everything was aligning.

Then came the moment.

I saw the van enter our street. This was it. After 8 weeks, my table was finally here.

And then, about 20 feet from my house, the van slowly sank into a patch of snow and mud.

At first, I thought, no big deal. He’ll reverse out.

He did not reverse out.

He was stuck. Completely stuck.

I went outside and we both just looked at the van, then at each other, then back at the van. Neither of us said anything for a few seconds. It was too absurd.

That van sat there for 6 hours.

Six hours.

Those 6 hours somehow felt longer than the entire 8 week wait. My table was physically closer to me than it had ever been, yet completely unreachable. It was like some kind of emotional torture experiment.

Eventually, with help and a lot of effort, the table made it inside.

And honestly, the second I saw it, I forgot about all of it.

It’s solid travertine, incredibly heavy, with a smooth filled surface and this soft creamy tone that makes it feel calm and permanent. The kidney shape makes it feel more like a sculpture than a regular coffee table. It completely changed the room.

Now every time I look at it, I don’t just see a table. I see the 8 weeks. The tracking page. The stuck van. The longest 6 hours of my life.

And weirdly, it was all worth it.

It’s the kidney shaped travertine coffee table with the cylindrical bases, the one with the soft wavy form. this exact one if anyone’s curious what caused me so much psychological damage.

The meeting began normally enough.

Tax Preparation Services — $3,200

“That’s your filings, schedules, depreciation work, and compliance review,” the accountant explained. “Standard stuff.”

Halpern agreed the charge seemed reasonable before moving to the next item.

Document Analysis — $650

“That’s copying and pasting numbers into columns so they make sense to the IRS,” the accountant explained.

Halpern nodded, acknowledging that this appeared to be work.

The meeting then continued into charges that shifted away from mechanical tax preparation and toward operational support infrastructure.

Keyboard Depreciation Recovery — $220

Chair Load-Bearing Utilization — $310

Halpern blinked, then continued reading.

Strategic Coffee Consumption — $190

The accountant clarified the charge reflected caffeine required to maintain calculation accuracy.

“You want alert math, not tired math.”

Halpern said nothing.

Email Correspondence — $480

“That covers when I had my administrator print all of the email correspondence for me to read,” the accountant explained, adding that screens introduce scrolling fatigue while briefly displaying a bandage on his right index finger.

Halpern paused before continuing.

Therapeutic Muscular Optimization — $540

“That’s massage therapy to keep my muscles loose for copy and paste. Tight shoulders introduce data-transfer inefficiencies.”

Witnesses reported Halpern staring silently at the document.

Seasonal Cognitive Filtering Interval — $975

When Halpern asked about the charge, the accountant clarified:

“This is needed because I reached a point while doing your taxes where I have to stare at the computer and zone out. It’s a useful filtering process. A lot of intricate gaps get filled introspectively.”

Halpern blinked once.

He added that the practice significantly improved downstream spreadsheet intuition.

The final section of the bill contained the largest charge.

Professional Cognitive Restoration Retreat — $7,845

Halpern blinked twice and asked for clarification.

At this point, the accountant reportedly launched into an impassioned explanation.

“Do you have any idea how many changes the state and federal governments make every year? Thousands. Thousands of updates. Pages of revisions. And reviewing them is boring.”

He paused, then posed the question directly.

“So let me ask you — where’s the best place to do this? Somewhere that increases adrenaline. Keeps your mind sharp. Mechanically controlled.”

He nodded.

“That’s right. Roller coasters.”

Experts confirm the logic is internally consistent.

“At a certain billing maturity level, clients aren’t just paying for labor,” said one consultant familiar with professional services economics. “They’re funding the conditions under which labor continues to exist.”

He added that studies have shown proximity to large groups of people screaming can increase situational awareness, refine motor skills, and produce measurable short-term gains in IQ, making theme parks an increasingly popular environment for regulatory review, particularly during peak tax season.

At press time, Halpern was reportedly reviewing an additional supplemental charge labeled:

I just started Medical Residency at the start of the year, and I've already lost 2.5kg!

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

1r11502,https://www.reddit.com/r/CookorTakeout/comments/1r11502/the_breakfast_balance_problem_nutbutter_edition/,The Breakfast Balance Problem: Nut-Butter Edition,"We often start our mornings with toast, peanut butter, and banana. However, I’ve noticed that when choosing alternatives like almond butter, sunflower seed butter, or tahini, the toast tends to feel much drier. As someone who’s gluten intolerant, this is even more noticeable since gluten-free toast breaks apart more easily than regular wheat toast.

Adding jam can help with moisture, but it doesn’t offer the same flavor or texture as banana. While banana does add some moisture even on toasted bread, I honestly don’t notice a huge difference between using jam or banana. And of course, toast pairs well with morning coffee, but not everyone enjoys the same kind. When you add a flavored coffee loaded with syrup or sugar, it can easily overpower the entire breakfast.

What do you put on your breakfast toast?",1,1770731135.0,CookorTakeout,0,1.0,False
1r1146j,https://i.redd.it/5juywtal8oig1.jpeg,Will a robot mower do well in a yard like mine?,"Hi everyone,

I retired last year and had back surgery, so pushing a regular mower has still been a bit of a struggle for me. My neighbor has a robot mower and seems really happy with it. He mentioned that his morning routine now is just sitting on the patio with a coffee while the mower does its thing. That got me thinking about trying one myself.

I know there's usually a bit of setup at the start, and I'm not sure I'll be perfect at it, but it seems worth considering. My yard is mostly simple, though there's one section I'm a little worried about. It's a landscaped area with raised beds, brick edging, a patio, and a few small trees along the wall. I'm not sure if a robot mower would handle that space without getting confused or stuck.

Has anyone here used a robot mower in a setup like this? I'd really appreciate any tips or experiences you could share. For reference, my neighbor's is an Anthbot, so I'm curious how well it works in trickier areas like this.",2,1770731080.0,landscaping,8,0.6,False
1r113pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDoseCoolFinds/comments/1r113pt/spent_hours_crossreferencing_before_buying_heres/,Spent hours cross-referencing before buying: Here’s the simple system I use for finding truly good deals online (Saved $250+ on tech & home goods this quarter) 💸,"Honestly, I'm fed up with 'sales' that aren't really sales. You know the drill: a product suddenly has a ""70% off!"" sticker, but a quick check reveals that 'original price' was either totally made up or the item was cheaper last month anyway. It feels like a constant battle against clever marketing designed to trick us into thinking we're getting a steal.

A few months ago, I started actively tracking prices and doing a bit more digging before any purchase, and the difference in actual savings versus perceived savings is pretty significant. It's not about 'secret hacks,' just a bit of patience and reality-checking. Here's a glimpse of what I mean:

*   **Wireless Mouse (Tech):** I needed a new reliable wireless mouse. I saw a few ""limited time offers"" for $35-$40. Instead of biting, I kept an eye on a specific model I liked. It finally dropped to **$24.99** on Amazon. Checking price history tools confirmed this was the lowest it had been in over 8 months, consistently sitting around $40-$45 otherwise. **Real savings: $15-$20.**
*   **Bamboo Sheet Set (Home Goods):** My partner wanted some good quality bamboo sheets. Everywhere seemed to have them 'on sale' for $90-$100. We waited, checking a few different retailers and reviewing a handful of brands. Ended up finding a highly-rated set from a lesser-known brand for **$65**. Price comparison confirmed this was its genuine low point for the last year. **Real savings: $25-$35** compared to the 'sale' prices we initially saw.
*   **Specialty Coffee (Groceries):** My preferred brand of coffee pods usually hovers around $30-$35 for a large pack. I frequently see 'discounts' bringing it down to $28. But from tracking, I know it occasionally drops to **$22-$24** for a very short window. I patiently waited and stocked up when it hit that lower range. **Real savings: $6-$8** per pack, which adds up on a regular purchase.

Now, let's be realistic here. This isn't some magic formula where everything you buy will be half price. It requires a bit of patience, and sometimes you *will* miss a deal if you're not quick enough or if stock runs out. Also, some of these genuinely good prices might come from less common retailers, so always double-check shipping times and return policies. Regional availability can also be a factor. The effort-to-reward ratio isn't always perfect, but when it hits, it feels good knowing you got something at its *actual* lowest price, not just a marketing gimmick.

1r10z8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jazzi92/comments/1r10z8z/how_to_start_an_online_tshirt_business_a/,How to Start an Online T-Shirt Business: A Step-by-Step Guide (for Shopify Store Owners),"# Why T-Shirts Are a Good Online Business

T-shirts remain one of the most popular online products because:

* People wear them daily
* Designs can target unlimited niches
* Production can be automated
* Profit margins are predictable
* Returns are manageable

**Activate the Shopify $1 Trial For 3 Month:** [**Shopify Exclusive Trial**](https://themelooks.com/shopifytrial)

Most successful T-shirt stores do **not** sell generic designs. They focus on a **specific audience**.

# Step 1: Choose a Clear T-Shirt Niche

A niche is a **specific group of people** with shared interests.

# Bad niche (too broad)

* “Funny T-shirts”
* “Cool designs”
* “Trendy clothing”

# Good niche (specific)

* Gym lovers who train at home
* Cat owners who love sarcasm
* Software developers who drink coffee
* New dads with dark humor

**Rule:** If everyone is your customer, no one is.

# How to validate a niche

* Search Reddit for niche communities
* Look at best-selling T-shirts on marketplaces
* Check Instagram or TikTok hashtags
* See if people already buy related products

If people already spend money, that’s a good sign.

# Step 2: Decide What Kind of Designs You’ll Sell

You don’t need to be a designer.

# Common T-shirt design types

* Text-based quotes
* Minimal illustrations
* Meme-style humor
* Profession-based jokes
* Motivational or lifestyle phrases

# Design tips for beginners

* Simple designs sell better
* High contrast (dark shirt + light text)
* Avoid too many colors
* Focus on readability from distance

You can:

* Create designs yourself using simple tools
* Hire a freelancer
* Buy commercial-use designs

The goal is **clarity**, not complexity.

# Step 3: Set Up Your Shopify Store (Basic Only)

You do not need advanced settings to start.

# What you actually need

* A Shopify account
* A clean, simple theme
* Basic pages:
   * Home
   * Product page
   * About
   * Contact
   * Shipping & Returns

# Keep your store simple

* One product type (T-shirts only)
* Few color options
* Clear size chart
* Real product descriptions

Avoid trying to build a “perfect” store. Launch fast and improve later.

# Step 4: Use Print-on-Demand (No Inventory)

Print-on-demand means:

* A shirt is printed **only after someone orders**
* No stock, no warehouse
* Orders are fulfilled automatically

# How it works

1. Customer orders from your Shopify store
2. Order goes to print partner
3. Shirt is printed and shipped
4. You keep the profit

# Why this is ideal for beginners

* No upfront inventory cost
* Easy to test designs
* Scales automatically

Choose quality over the cheapest option. Bad print quality kills repeat customers.

# Step 5: Create High-Quality Product Pages

Your product page sells the shirt.

# Must-have elements

* Clear product title
* Lifestyle mockup image
* Simple description (not marketing hype)
* Size chart
* Fabric and fit info
* Shipping timeframe

# Example (simple description style)

>

Clarity beats persuasion.

# Step 6: Price Your T-Shirts Correctly

Pricing is not about being cheapest.

# Typical pricing formula

* Base cost (print + shipping): $8–$12
* Selling price: $19–$29

# Pricing tips

* Leave room for ads later
* Avoid underpricing
* Customers pay for design + identity

People don’t buy T-shirts.  
They buy **what the shirt represents**.

# Step 7: Launch Without Waiting for Perfection

Most stores fail because they never launch.

# Launch checklist

* At least 3–5 designs
* Store works on mobile
* Checkout tested
* Policies published

That’s enough.

You can:

* Fix designs later
* Change prices later
* Improve copy later

Speed matters more than perfection.

# Step 8: Promote Your T-Shirt Store (Beginner-Friendly)

You don’t need big ad budgets.

# Organic promotion ideas

* Post designs in niche subreddits (follow rules)
* Share on niche Facebook groups
* Short videos showing designs
* Comment-based marketing (helpful, not spammy)

# Paid promotion (optional later)

* Simple social ads
* One design per campaign
* Small daily budget

Start organic. Learn before spending.

# Step 9: Manage Orders and Customer Support

With print-on-demand:

* Orders sync automatically
* Shipping is handled
* Tracking is provided

# Your main responsibility

* Answer emails
* Handle size issues politely
* Be transparent about shipping time

Clear communication reduces refunds.

# Step 10: Improve Based on Data (Not Feelings)

After launch, watch:

* Which designs get clicks
* Which designs get sales
* Which sizes sell most
* Which niches respond better

# What to improve first

* Best-selling design variations
* Product photos
* Titles and descriptions

Remove designs that don’t sell. Focus on winners.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Starting without a niche
* Copying viral designs blindly
* Overloading the store with options
* Expecting instant success
* Ignoring customer feedback

This is a **real business**, not a shortcut.

# How Long Does It Take to Make Sales?

* Some stores get first sale in days
* Others take weeks
* Most fail because they quit early

Consistency beats talent.

# Is This Business Still Worth It?

Yes, **if**:

* You focus on a clear audience
* You keep designs simple
* You treat it like a business

No, **if**:

* You expect passive income
* You copy without understanding
* You stop after one failed design

Most people focus solely on the mining aspect, but the synergy between the virtual and the physical here is what truly impresses me.

It all starts with the Digital Miners. Being able to own liquid hash power through NFTs is a game-changer, providing consistent BTC rewards without the headache of physical maintenance. But GoMining takes it a step further by giving those rewards real-world purchasing power through the GoMining Card.

For me, the cashback feature is the ultimate win. By using the card for daily expenses, you aren't just spending; you are earning back a percentage of your transactions, which can then be cycled back into the ecosystem. Imagine using your cashback to fund your next hash power upgrade or to buy more GOMINING tokens to lower your electricity fees—it creates a perfect loop of value.

And let’s not forget the competitive side. Whether you are a solo miner or a clan leader in the Miner Wars, having a streamlined way to manage your assets and spend your earnings makes the whole experience feel professional and complete. It’s no longer just a ""crypto project""; it’s a full financial suite for the modern miner.

The combination of passive income from NFTs, the utility of the native token, and the practical benefits of the card (with those sweet cashback perks) makes this one of the most robust ecosystems in the space right now.

Quick question for the community: How many of you are already using the GoMining Card for your daily coffee or groceries? Has the cashback helped you reach your next TH/s milestone faster?

\- Beans are CoffeeWorks Chocolate Brownie (roasted 2 weeks ago)

\- Double espresso

\- 17 (I tried to make less sour) - BA suggested 19

\- 19 (began to splutter a lot) - BA suggested 17

\- 17 x3 (all weighed between 36-38g which is good??) - BA happy

So it looks like BA settled at grind size 17, and the output of liquid is 36-38g which technically lines up with what is a good double espresso volume - BUT I’m not sure about the shot pour itself, as you can see in the video it looks a bit bubbly and I’m not sure if the speed/duration of the shot is any good (all 3x at 17 took between 14-18 seconds from when first drips hit the cup).

1r10xvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/franchise_opportunity/comments/1r10xvc/best_donut_franchise_opportunities_to_own/,Best donut franchise opportunities to own?,"I'm looking into the best donut franchise opportunities to own and trying to figure out whether this is a legitimate business opportunity or just something that works for a handful of locations in perfect spots.

Donuts seem like they should be a straightforward business - low ticket, high volume, morning rush, impulse buys - but I'm also wondering how much success depends on being in exactly the right location versus having a strong brand and product that people actually seek out.

If you have owned a donut franchise, managed one, or worked in one, what would you recommend and why? And what's the biggest challenge most people don't see coming until they're already open?

I am especially curious whether the best play is a traditional donut shop model, a drive-thru focused concept, or something more premium with specialty flavors and higher pricing. And how much does coffee and beverage sales matter to making the numbers work, or can you really succeed on donuts alone?

In 2026, do you think donut franchises are still a smart buy or is competition from grocery stores, gas stations, and other breakfast options making it harder to stand out and stay profitable?",1,1770730639.0,franchise_opportunity,0,1.0,False

Global unit case volumes grew 1% for the October-December period, led by the U.S., Japan and Brazil, the Atlanta beverage giant said Tuesday. Unit case volumes also rose by 1% in North America, reversing several quarters of flat or declining sales.

Coke said it hiked prices 4% in North America and 1% globally during the quarter. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was a strong performer, with sales up 13% for the October-December period. Water, sports drinks, coffee and tea also saw stronger demand, while juices and dairy products faltered.

The company said last fall that it’s seeing a divergence among consumers in North America and Europe, with higher-income buyers opting for its more expensive brands like Smartwater, Topo Chico and Fairlife while middle- and lower-income consumers are under more pressure.

""Is happiness just a notification sound? Or is it the most modern prison of loneliness?""

Virtual Showcase questions the unhappiness hidden behind filters, the hunger for approval, and the lies of the ""perfect life.""

For those who grab their phones as soon as they wake up, those who search for a photo angle while their coffee is getting cold, and those who put their souls on display...

Tell me, how many likes did you get today?

Lyrics:

Your hand went to your bedside before you even opened your eyes

The blue light hit your tired face again.

That happy picture you shared last night

Is it really you, or is it a solution?

Your coffee got cold while you were taking the picture

Living in the moment? What's that, while you're decorating the showcase?

Tell me, how many likes did you get today?

How many hearts did you gain by selling your soul?

Is happiness just a notification sound?

Or is this the most modern prison of loneliness?

How many likes did you get? (Like!)

How many hearts did you steal? (Fake!)

You're a king in the virtual world, but you're alone at home.

Everyone is so beautiful, everyone is so rich there.

Filters hide the cracks in the wall.

The hunger for approval, an endless crisis.

Other people's lives are just a trace for you.

Smile, I'm taking a picture! (Click sound)

Now you can cry, the sharing is over.

A number... Just a number, that's all you're worth.

If you're not liked, you don't exist, your place is erased.

No one really asks ""How are you?"".

Everyone is busy choosing the best angle.

The battery is running out...

The screen is going black...

Your face is reflected in that black mirror.

‘A House for Mr Biswas’ written by V.S. Naipaul, published in the year 1961 by Picador, is the debut of the then young writer hailing from Trinidad and Tobago. It is a novel of 618 pages and is priced around Four Hundred to Five Hundred Rupees.  The book, a seminal piece of post-colonial literature, is a family drama that ties the ideas of culture, alienation, ambition and freedom. The main draw of the novel is not its plot, which is bare minimum at most, but its luscious prose and tantalizingly beautiful scenes of heartfelt drama. Naipaul’s oeuvre has expanded into short stories, travel writing and much more but ‘A House for Mr Biswas’ remains his most enduring work because of its sheer humanity that few books have ever been able to achieve. (Name of the book author’s name - genre of the book - brief description of the content of the book)
         ‘A House for Mr Biswas’ is a book that is meant to be enjoyed low and slow on sunny mornings with a hot cup of coffee and silence. Naipaul’s writing needs to be consumed slowly in order for its enjoyment to be maximised. The novel is about a backward man from a backward race in a backward nation aspiring to become someone who he is not. The main character ‘Mohun Biswas’ born into a family where the father is a sharecropper and the mother a housekeeper, dreams of goals that are too huge for a man like him. The tragedy of this whole revue is the source of humanism, humour, drama and love that makes an amazing piece of work. The novel instantly became a bestseller, when it was published, pushing Naipaul to literary stardom. The novel’s popularity is not only because of its drama or humour or that it set a new foundation for post-colonial literature but because it held a mirror to the eyes of the reader and said aloud “You are Mohun Biswas and you are no better.” (Specific features of the book - reasons for its becoming a bestseller - theme)
          The novel sees the journey of ‘Mohun Biswas’ from a young infant to his death. He started his first job by lettering for roadside shops to a writer in Trinidad and Tobago’s leading newspaper ‘The Sentinel.’ His unnatural marriage into the Tulsi family and his constant fights with his wife who he never accepted until his last day. His family consisting of two girls and a boy that happened without intention. ‘Mohun Biswas’s life was full of random occurrences that led him from one point to another. But when he bought the titular house, blue coloured with a staircase outside and a streetlight nearby, he finally was able to realise his destiny. It was ‘A house for Mr Biswas.’ (Specific instances of the theme - climax)
          The book is an intensely humanistic read that forces you to look at yourself and ask ‘Who are you and why are you?’ It is a tragedy but also a comedy. It is everything a novel should be and more. (Overall Impression)

# A bit of backstory (because context matters)

Most of my life, I was the “top kid.” Good at studies, sports, social stuff. Teachers liked me. People came to me for help. I had friends, relationships, the whole thing.

But I was always maintaining an image always trying to be “cool.” Hanging out with popular kids, doing what looked right instead of what felt right. There were things I genuinely loved (like art) that I ignored because they didn’t fit the image.

I’m done with that.

I know I’m a nerd. I *want* to be a nerd.  
And I don’t want 50 surface-level friends who don’t care about what I love. I want **2–3 people** who actually get me and give a damn.

1r10rok,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1r10rok/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1770730206.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False
1r10roh,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1r10roh/adhd_burnout_when_does_it_end/,ADHD Burnout - when does it end?,"I'm not sure why I'm posting this, maybe to get some advice or insight from people who experienced a similar thing.. Or I'm just trying to piece things together and understand myself because it feels like everyone in my life thinks I'm just lazy.

I'm 28, for 3 years I had a very demanding job as an executive assistant to a CEO. Sometime around 2021 (I had COVID in the beginning of 2021), I started feeling stuck at work aka I would still go to work but I wasn't performing as good as before. Mainly I would push new tasks for later and later until it was months after and I still didn't start and I had a massive pile of things to do that was just constantly growing. I also started taking more sick days, it was a pattern of: I work for 3 weeks, then suddenly my brain and body stops and I need to rot on the couch and do nothing for a week. I blamed it on depression which is something I was diagnosed with when I was 12, I was and still am on medication for depression.

Last March I had a massive breakdown and I quit my job telling myself that I just need few months of rest and I'll get back to ""normal life"". It's been almost a year now and nothing has changed. I spent a whole year doing absolutely nothing. Not even doing things that I enjoy such as playing games or reading books. My day looks like: wake up, have coffee, leave bed and go on the couch, stay scrolling on the phone, think about everything that I should / want to do but don't do it, realize it's now 8pm and it's too late to do anything so let's just eat dinner and go to sleep saying to myself that tomorrow will be different. I always go to sleep with so many plans for the next day and yet I end up doing nothing. I want to get back to work and have a normal life but I can't seem to force my brain and body to perform. My house hasn't been cleaned in months and it's affecting my mood but at the same time I can't clean it. My partner offers to clean it himself but then I literally refuse to let him do it because I feel guilty. He's currently working full time and financially supporting us both so I feel bad if I also make him do everything else around the house. 

I don't know, there's much more to say but even writing this felt like such a massive chore. I spoke with a mental health nurse and she suggested I get diagnosed for ADHD so I started the process.. I have some forms that I need to fill out for this sitting in my inbox for few weeks now and yes, you guessed it, I haven't filled them out yet because I ""can't"".

1r10rnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1r10rnr/comparing_9_different_dating_apps/,Comparing 9 Different Dating Apps,"I got 9 different ones 2 months ago, so I decided to do a little roundup of how they compare and my experiences with each. It mostly covers the actual usability of the app as well as the process of finding and liking people on it. As I received no matches yet on any of these apps on 2 months of use I can't comment on the matching or chatting functionality.

  
Tinder:

In total, it took around 2 weeks of swiping until it ran out of people to show. It gives you a decent amount of likes a day. It was the most active like-wise, with me receiving by far the most likes of any apps on it, coming in at 15. While like with most other apps you have to pay to see who likes you, there is also a special minigame you sometimes get to play, where you randomly draw someone who liked you at random. While it might sound like a good way to get matches without playing, not only is the game pretty rare, but Tinder also doesn't prevent the gender you're not attracted to from liking you. So for me every time the minigame came up, I drew a guy, making the whole experience rather useless with no way to prevent people from sending likes from spoiling the game. 

Tinder also had amongst the highest amount of bots or clearly fake profiles, and a moderate overall quality of potential matches. There were also several bugs, like how in the menu that sorts people by interests or dating goals, sometimes it showed there are still people in those categories to swipe on, even if there weren't any. At other times when I tapped into those categories, it would just give me profiles I've already gotten before. Another time it bugged out and gave me a bunch of accounts that where all hundreds of km away but shown them as being less than a km from me.

Hinge:

It has by far the lowest amount of daily likes of any of these apps. While annoying in itself, what makes it more annoying is the fact that it also has probably the highest quality of profiles and potential matches of all these apps, so there's a lot of people you'd want to like. With this limit, it took over a month to run out of people in my area. Also, you don't just like a profile, but something like a photo or conversation starter within the profile. You also get paid likes, here called roses, for free every week or so. While those are all neat ideas, alongside the fact you can even leave a comment alongside your like for free, it seems to have no conversion on the amount of likes or matches. It is one of the 3 apps on this list where I received no likes. It also has one of the most clean-looking interfaces, with minimal bugs.

  
Bumble:

Bumble, alongside Hinge, probably had the highest quality of profiles on it. While it's also fairly limited in terms of likes, it's not as much as Hinge. However the likes seem to just appear throughout the day with no clear timer or anything, so you just have to keep opening the app often just to see if you got any more likes or not, making it rather annoying.

  
It took slightly less time than Tinder to go through everyone in my area. In terms of like activity, at 5 likes it's about in the middle of that ranking.

  
Badoo:

It was certainly one of the most annoying platforms to deal with. Not only did it take about a week to run out of profiles, it has this bad habit of auto-adjusting the distance range on your profile for you so you always have someone to swipe on, so you're always constantly having to dial it back down to only get people close by. One decent thing is that you can send paid likes for free if you watch an ad. A decent idea, but had no effect in my case on the probability of a response. Swiping also gets often interrupted with ads, though it's easy enough to just close and open the app again when that happens.

It also has a special tab which just lists profiles at once. It's a neat idea to have a list like that instead of swiping, however the execution is horrible. You can't see distance in the main view, some profiles you can like while others you can only instant chat with and you don't know which is which until you click on them. It's all very confusingly laid out, even if I did like the idea of just giving you a giant list.

It also had probably the worst quality of profiles and potential matches of all these apps, though at least I didn't spot any obviously fake profiles. Like activity-wise, it draws with Bumble at 5.

  
Feeld:

While nicely designed, it's incredibly slow and clunky. There can be several seconds of slowdown on any action. It can get so bad that you can accidentally dislike someone's profile because you double-tapped on the previous one.

It has a fairly strict likes limit, however at least it gives you a clear timer when it resets. Activity-wise it's fairly dead, taking just 3 days to run out of people to like, while I received just 1 like on the platform. The few profiles that did pop up were of pretty high quality though and many I wanted to like.

  
Happn:

An app with several good ideas let down by how inactive it is. Took just two days with it's average daily like limit to run out. I like how it can show you people you crossed paths with, though again that rarely happens. I'm sure it can in theory lead to some sweet moments where you have a thing for the girl in your local coffee shop or something and you wanted to talk to her, only to then finally get the chance because you find each other on the app thanks to this feature. But that is very unlikely to happen. To make up for the lack of people, there are no distance filters, so I had suggestion for people in different countries come up.

In terms of like activity, I got 5 likes on this one. Similar to Tinder, there is a minigame involved you can sometimes get. However instead of giving you 4 likes, it gives you 4 different profiles with only 1 of them liking you, and you have to guess who. I only got that game once in the two months on the app though. It is also fairly slow and buggy at times.

Fruitz:

While it can look cute with its fruity aesthetic, there is nothing practical that really sets it apart. The fruit are meant to represent different dating intentions, so it's taking something most other apps have and putting a fancy graphic on it. You can also only see a certain amount of people's fruit a day, which can seem rather counterproductive as you might be sending likes to people with completely different goals, however same can be done on any dating app really.

In terms of activity, it took 3 days to run out of profiles, and had a total of 0 likes.

Breeze:

A rather unique app given how there is no chatting, rather you go straight to meeting someone in person. ""To discourage swiping culture"" or in reality to make up for how inactive the app is, it limits you to only receiving 1-2 profiles each day at exactly 7pm. Once you both like each other, you set up a date and time for a date and a venue the app collaborates with. While I would love to tell about how the whole process works, sadly again I can't.

Given how few people you get each day, it took almost a month to actually run out of people, with fairly high-quality profiles, though with no likes received.

Probably the best part about it, and something I can't believe other apps don't have, is that the distance filter comes with a visual representation of the radius on a map, actually giving you some context for once how far away 20km actually is, allowing you to better fine-tune that range to your liking.

  
Pure:  
This is one is rather unique in the fact that it's in essence paid-only, with pretty much nothing to do without the rather expensive subscription. There's not even a trial or anything. So this is the only one I actually paid for a month for to try. While you can email them to ask for discount but it's so low you may as well not bother. It's a rather bold if annoying move, as you can't even properly check beforehand how active or inactive it is in your area. As such, there were only 17 profiles within 30km of me. What makes this worse is that when someone is away for more than a day, it just says ""last seen a few days ago"", so that can mean anything from 2 days ago to completely inactive and last seen a month ago. With this kind of activity you can expect that I got 0 likes, however unlike the others, I only used this for a month as I couldn't be bothered to pay for another month of such an annoying app.

You also don't swipe in the regular way, instead there is a constant list of people you can like. The likes are confusing though, as sometimes they just disappear on their own with no idea if they expired and the other person hasn't even seen them or if the other person rejected it or what. So you can just like profiles over and over, though with no indicator when you sent a like last, I get paranoid I end up spamming someone with likes if I forgot when I last liked someone. It also constantly blasts ads in your face to buy paid likes and instant chats, while you are already paying for the app which just feels insulting.

It also comes with a game where you get to voice that with a random person, but again given the small userbase I wasn't able to find anyone for that.",1,1770730204.0,DatingApps,0,1.0,False

I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1770730177.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False

“I like music, movies, games.” Cool. So does literally everyone with a pulse.

What I’m actually looking for are people who are **nerds about something**. Anything. Art. History. Engines. Lore. Cooking. Some hyper-specific obsession you could rant about at 3am. If you don’t know what you’re passionate about yet, that’s fine, but figure it out. Otherwise conversations die fast, and I’m not here for that.

Another thing: disappearing and never texting first.  
If we’re talking and things are going well, then you vanish for days like you got abducted by aliens. yeah, no. If I say *long-term*, I mean **long-term**. Not “we talked for a week and now we pretend we never met.” And I can't stand the people who never text first like bro I'm not talking to chatgpt, You can text first too a simple ""Hey How u doin?"" Goes a long way.

Also, let’s be real for a second:

* A lot of guys here are clearly just looking for girls. Own it or don’t do it.
* And some people (yes, including girls) really struggle to hold a conversation. Friendship needs effort from both sides.

Okay. Rant over.

# Now, about me.

Hi, I’m **Vi**, 18M, and I’m looking for **genuine, long-term friendships**. Not timepass. If you’re bored for a week and then gone, this isn’t for you.

I’ve finished school. Not really into the whole college path right now. I work in my dad’s company, but I want to build something of my own. I’m planning to start a YouTube channel this year, and yeah, I’m serious about it.

Things I’m into:

* **Art & animation** (this is my big thing)
* **Cars & bikes** anything with an engine. I fix my own stuff and I’m a full-on mechanic nerd
* **Fashion** Like I'm really getting into fashion and stuff and not just oh I like to dress well but I see I try too make it. If I see a real cool jacket. I'll try to recreate as close to possible as possible. And no this is personal I don't sell them.
* **Airsoft, milsim, military history** (sadly not popular where I live, but I’m deep into it)
* **Warhammer & DnD** (never played DnD yet, but I really want to maybe we change that)
* **Cooking** coffee, mocktails, cocktails, experimenting like a mad scientist in the kitchen (my mom is not a fan)
* **Animals > humans**, always. I’ve got a dog and I’m currently taking care of a pigeon family
* **Basketball** used to play every evening with a friend, now it’s mostly just me
* **Gym** not obsessed, but I like how I look, so I stick with it

I’m always down to learn new things too, so even if your interests are totally different, I’m open as long as you actually care about them.

# A bit of backstory (because context matters)

Most of my life, I was the “top kid.” Good at studies, sports, social stuff. Teachers liked me. People came to me for help. I had friends, relationships, the whole thing.

But I was always maintaining an image always trying to be “cool.” Hanging out with popular kids, doing what looked right instead of what felt right. There were things I genuinely loved (like art) that I ignored because they didn’t fit the image.

I’m done with that.

I know I’m a nerd. I *want* to be a nerd.  
And I don’t want 50 surface-level friends who don’t care about what I love. I want **2–3 people** who actually get me and give a damn.

If you’re someone who’s passionate, building something, or at least knows the direction you want to go but feels lonely while doing it yeah, that’s why I’m here.

Be my friend, and I’ll be there for you. Not for a week. Not for a month. Not even for a year.  
I mean **years**.

# A few important things:

1. Don’t start with just “hi.” Tell me about yourself. What are you into? Why are you here?
2. I prefer calls over endless texting but we can ease into it. Ask questions if you’re unsure.
3. I won’t always text first. I want mutual effort. Random 3am “wyd?” texts are welcome.
4. You can ask me anything what I look like, whatever. Just ask.
5. **Strictly SFW.** Even a hint of NSFW and I’m gone.
6. Any age and gender works with me so don't shy out.

Yeah, it’s long. I don’t do this every day.

""The bustle around him could have been enough to make his head spin.

Buttons clicking, machines crackling, papers rustling...

All around him, the hall was crawling with tired men and women. Some merely passed through, leaving behind the lingering smell of cold coffee and stale cigarettes. Others stopped and moved on again, caught in a poorly rehearsed ballet, handling with detached ease devices whose sale alone could probably have fed his family for weeks.

Under normal circumstances, he would have observed. He would have questioned these people swarming around him and scribbled in his notebook - *every experience eventually feeds my novels*.  
But not here. Not now.

From beyond the wings, muffled sounds reached him: bursts of laughter, raised voices, heels striking the wooden floor. People were gaining their seats. In a few minutes, the show would have to begin - and he still hadn’t seen her.

The dark-haired man with thin-framed glasses stared at the small screen in front of him with fierce intensity, his mind unable to form any other thought amid the chaos.

*“Lénore.”*

*“Lénore.”*

*“Lénore.”*

At last, a young woman appeared in the small living room of their chalet.  
His anchor. The one who would keep him from breaking tonight.

Her hair was a mess, a sharp contrast to the calm that seemed to emanate from her.

He wanted to let out a sigh of relief, but the air remained trapped in his chest.

He didn’t mind the mess in the room (after all, they were young parents), and their stillness could easily have been blamed on stage fright.

And yet, something felt wrong.

A knot tightened in the pit of his stomach. His heart began to race, his palms turning clammy as a cold, cutting voice tore him away from the thoughts that had started to rush in again.

“Mr. Vernier? You’re on in five…”

Time froze. A wave of nausea rose in his throat, catching him by surprise.

“Four…”

His hands were shaking. His breathing shallow.

“Three…”

His legs felt weak. The noise of the machines and the murmurs of the audience blurred into a low, almost hypnotic hum.

“Two…”

Everything faded. Everything - except Lénore’s image.

He forced a breath in and it felt like the first one since he arrived. The smells of coffee and stale smoke clung to the back of his throat.

“One…”

He wiped his hands on his jacket, straightened his shoulders, and stepped forward - steady, composed - into the warm glow of the spotlights.""",1,1770730126.0,writers,1,1.0,False

The car radio played:

 

*Bend down, baby, kiss the floor*

*Twerk it like a Hill Street whore*

*Bitch gon’ make me nut some more*

*Bitch gon’ make me nut some more*

 

Vic switched to silence. *Seriously?* he thought. *Mainstream hip-hop isn’t even trying anymore. Pretty soon they’ll just be grunting and burping over the beat: uh-huh, uh-huh-huh. As long as girls can dance to it, I doubt that anyone will even notice.*  

 

His thoughts twisted toward the day’s newspaper, now stashed beneath the passenger seat. He’d purchased it an hour prior, panicking in a convenience store parking lot, before finally mustering the courage to step inside the establishment. Living in his car, eating nothing but fast food while eschewing the comforts of running water, had left him grimy and reeking, just one small step above a vagrant. 

 

Waiting in the convenience store line, clutching a disgusting microwaved breakfast sandwich and a Powerade, he’d noticed two girls staring from the wine racks. One looked familiar—pretty but not overtly so—a face half-remembered from high school hallways. 

 

Unsure whether he was a fugitive or not, Vic felt horribly exposed in their proximity. Carefully putting his back to the ladies, he’d adopted a relaxed posture, and watched the ahead-of-him customers toss money to the cashier. Still, he’d caught the girls’ attention. 

 

“Hey, Megs, isn’t that the guy…you know, the weird one? Remember, that jerkoff who found his locker filled with used diapers during Spirit Week?”

 

Vic felt himself blushing, as shameful memories resurfaced. 

 

“Oh, yeah, I remember now. Didn’t the lacrosse team do that?”

 

“I think so. Man, what a freak.”

 

“Capital ‘L’ Loser, for sure. He *is* kind of cute, though. I wonder if he’s gay or just socially retarded.”

 

“I don’t know. Either way, he *definitely* still lives with his mother.”

 

The females cackled like octogenarian crones. Vic wanted to flee to the parking lot, but knew that bolting would only make the girls laugh harder. 

 

“I wonder if he knows that we’re talking about him,” Megs chortled. 

 

*No, bitch, I’m deaf*, he’d thought, wanting to scream it. Still, all things considered, at least they hadn’t mentioned a murder. If Vic was a suspect, it seemed that the media hadn’t reported it. 

 

At the register, he snatched up a newspaper, handed over a twenty, and waited for the cashier to count out change. Glancing back toward the wine racks, he’d seen the females staring, their eyes suffused with merriment. “Fuck ’em,” he’d muttered, exiting into open air.            

 

Subsequently studying the newspaper, Vic had read something that sent Powerade spraying from his face hole. Knut Jansson’s murderer *had* been caught, it reported. During a burglary gone wrong, Hutch Sampson, a local boxing instructor, stabbed-stabbed-stabbed and fled. He’d left some trace evidence behind—hair and unspecified fibers—and had no alibi for the time of murder. 

 

The arrest photo featured a scowling crew cut above a neck like a waterlogged tree trunk. *Who is this dude?* Vic had wondered. *Did the Silent Minority frame him? They wrote that they’d keep my secret, but never mentioned anything like this.* 

 

He’d peered closer. With the image mere centimeters from his scrutiny, in Sampson’s eyes, Vic had beheld rage and confusion consolidated, menace scarcely subdued. His lips were swollen and split. A bruise marked his right cheek, indicating that he’d resisted arrest. *Who is this dude?*

 

He turned onto Reginald Court. *Wow, what a depressing street*, Vic thought. Starving felines straggled through barren lots, their open sores leaking. Dirty-faced children rode bicycles over dirt bumps. Drug-bleared mothers populated picnic benches, scrutinizing their own infants as if they were extraterrestrials. There’d been a community there once, indicated by the many condemned houses and burnt-out storefronts. Now, only squatters and liquor stores remained. 

 

1414 was past the desolation, behind an open security gate, and consisted of a parking lot housing two-dozen vehicles, and an ugly prefabricated steel warehouse, painted sky blue. If the firmament that morning hadn’t been grey and cloud-plagued, the squat structure might have benefited from chameleon-like camouflage, and appeared less like an overturned cereal box.       

 

Vic parked. Somebody lurked at the warehouse’s rolled-up shutter door, and so Vic trudged over to greet him. Drawing closer, Vic realized that a surgical mask concealed the man’s mouth and nose. Closer still, and he saw that the mask had been painted: two monkey paws over the man’s mouth, homage to Iwazaru, the “speak no evil” ape. 

 

“Uh, hi there,” Vic said. “My name’s Victor Dickens. I was invited here.” 

 

Wordlessly, the man held up a copy of the *DAY OF THE INTROVERT* pamphlet, raising one eyebrow in silent inquiry. 

 

“You…want me to show you my pamphlet? Is that it?”

 

The man nodded. 

 

After a parking lot shuffle, Vic returned with his leaflet. The doorman waved him in.  

 

Vic encountered a table, its surface covered with surgical masks identical to the doorman’s. Beside it, a freestanding sign declared, *TAKE ONE. WEAR IT. YOUR DESIGNATED STATION IS:* There was a list of perhaps forty names, alphabetized. Finger-tracing his way down, Vic found his station: Number 24. 

 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous, Vic donned a mask. 

 

The warehouse’s initial purpose was a mystery. No goods or heavy machinery remained. Now, the building’s interior was filled with cubicles, stretching nearly from wall to wall. Blandly impersonal, each cubicle contained a desktop computer, desk, swivel chair and storage cabinet. Only the side partition numerals distinguished one from another.  

 

Searching out Number 24, Vic passed other occupied cubicles. Their occupants had their backs to him. Wearing headphones, they gawked at computer screens. Nobody spoke, but the silence wasn’t awkward or oppressive. In fact, the hush felt welcoming, like an open prairie at the end of time.  

 

Of the men and women he passed, a number were obese or shockingly thin. Some were albino-white; others emanated a fishy odor indicating Trimethylaminuria. A few seemed perfectly normal, attractive even, at least when glimpsed from behind. All wore surgical masks. 

 

Finally, Vic found his cubicle. Settling into a swivel chair, he turned his focus toward the computer monitor, which displayed a screen saver: a shifting chiaroscuro juxtaposing divine imagery with scenes of demonic torture. *This is just too damn weird*, Vic thought. Still, he jiggled the mouse to clear the screen, and donned the provided headphones. 

 

A prompt box requested identification, and so Vic typed his name, which started up a multimedia presentation.   

 

A flourish of trumpets sounded. Words slid across the screen: *GREETINGS, VICTOR DICKENS*. *WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT KNUT JANSSON’S “MURDERER” HAS BEEN APPREHENDED? YOU’RE WELCOME.* 

 

Hidden camera footage played, featuring a familiar figure inside a boxing gym’s locker room. Hutch Sampson, shirtless, smacked a skinny adolescent around, screaming, “Toughen up, pussy! Toughen up!”

 

*MEET HUTCH SAMPSON*, the text read, *BOXING INSTRUCTOR EXTRAORDINAIRE. FROM THE RING TO THE STREET, THIS PHILANTHROPIC FELLOW IS EVER-EAGER TO PROVIDE YOUNGSTERS WITH A HELPING HAND.*   

 

The scene switched to a back alley, presumably behind the gym. A boy surely no older than twelve, bespectacled, cried as Hutch forced him to eat a dead rodent. 

 

As the scene segued to showcase a battered woman shambling from her home to her car, Vic read, *MEET HUTCH’S GIRLFRIEND*. The woman’s face was contusion-covered, her eyes so swollen that she could scarcely navigate. Her zebra print leggings were bloodstained from the crotch down; her right shoulder hung out of socket. *IT APPEARS THAT SHE NEEDED SOME INSTRUCTION, TOO.* 

 

Hutch barreled into the screen, grabbed the dislocated appendage, and yanked the shrieking female back homeward. With disgusted fascination, Vic noticed that the man sported an erection. 

 

*Holy mackerel,* Vic thought. *And I actually felt bad for this dude.* 

 

*WE DON’T JUST MONITOR PROMISING INTROVERTS, BUT BULLIES AS WELL. IT’S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A FALL GUY, AFTER ALL, AND WE KEEP OUR EARS TO THE GROUND.* 

 

*HAVING MANY FRIENDS ON THE POLICE FORCE, HUTCH WAS PRACTICALLY IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION. THE COMPLAINTS OF HIS VICTIMS AND THEIR PARENTS WENT IGNORED, AND THE MAN CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE NEW STUDENTS. THE JOCKISH ONES WERE PROVIDED ORDINARY LESSONS, BUT THE INTROVERTS…BOY HOWDY! AS FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND, SHE WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO TALK. EVENTUALLY, THE SILENT MINORITY HAD TO STEP IN.* 

 

The screen permitted one final glimpse of Hutch Sampson, collapsing beneath a fusillade of Tasers and truncheons, his blood-painted face howling obscenities at the arresting officers.  

 

*ARE YOU RELIEVED, VICTOR? WELL, DON’T GET TOO COMFORTABLE. YOU STILL HAVE NEIGHBORS, AFTER ALL, AND THEY HATE YOU TREMENDOUSLY. YOUR DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER APPROACH WAS TOO RUDIMENTARY, BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF THEIR MALEVOLENCE. ERGO, WE WENT AHEAD AND BUGGED THEIR HOMES. IT’S NOT HARD TO DO, PROVIDED THAT YOU SHOW UP IN EXTERMINATOR GEAR, AND OFFER THEM A FREE TERMITE INSPECTION. HERE’S WHAT THEY SAID IN YOUR ABSENCE:*  

 

An audio compilation played, voices both familiar and strange. The first sounded like Knut’s brother: “I don’t care what the papers say! That little faggot had something to do with it! I swear to God, I’m gonna set up a noose in Vic’s garage, make it look like he hung himself!”

 

It cut to a conversation between two Hispanic-accented speakers. At first, Vic couldn’t recall any Hispanic neighbors. Then he remembered the two men who resided four houses down from him, who motored to parts unknown inside a grey Toyota truck every morning. 

 

“Victor has no dick, eh?” one asked. “He afraid of pussy?”

 

“Virgin, I think,” the other replied. “Pretty boy, yeah?”

 

The first speaker laughed. “Maybe we cut off his arms and use him for sex slave. White boy only good for fuck puppet, anyway.”

 

“Where we gonna put him when we’re done, homes?”

 

“Deep sea fishing, heh-heh.”

 

Had Vic been drinking something, it would have gone spraying all over the computer screen at that moment. He was aghast, having never considered the sexual connotations of his past victimizations. Had all those meatheads and gossip guys been attracted to him all along, and unable to express it properly? Should he be flattered on some level?    

 

“Ugh,” he grunted, shaking his head to dispel ghastly man-on-man rape visualizations. Even that short exclamation felt blasphemous in his current surroundings, wherein noise only emanated from headphone speakers.  

 

Vic recognized the next voice as Bill’s, considerably more sober than it had been on the digital voice recorder: “We need to teach him a lesson.” 

 

*Well, he could be referring to anybody*, Vic reasoned. Then came, “We’ll take two cars, sandwich his Taurus in so he can’t escape.” 

 

*Yikes*, Vic thought. *Never mind. What did I ever do to you, Bill? In fact, how about I teach you a lesson, dickhead? I won’t use a pencil, but I’ll write it in lead. Damn, that sounded cool in my head, just like an action hero. I wish I’d said it out loud.* Contemplations shifting somber, he frowned. *How many of those fuckers am I gonna have to kill?* 

 

And still they came, varying in gender and age:

 

“That Dickens boy needs therapy.”

 

“I tell you, he likes little kids.”

 

“Let’s wait until he goes to work, drive over a U-Haul, and take everything that faggot Victor owns. Little queerbait probably doesn’t even have insurance.”

 

“We already know he’s unstable.”

 

“What’s he doing in his room, sitting in the dark for two nights in a row?” *I wasn’t even home, you asshole*, Vic might have countered. 

 

Then, most ominously, came five enigmatic words, half-whispered: “We’ll bring Vic the scissors.”

 

*Okay, this is just getting ridiculous*, he thought. *No way could the neighborhood be this obsessed with me. Is the Silent Minority faking this somehow? I didn’t even recognize half of those voices. Seriously, what have I stumbled into? Is this a cult? Am I in a cult right now? Am I being brainwashed?*

 

The text returned: *WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, BIG GUY? YOU’RE PROBABLY SUSPECTING THAT WE’RE MESSING WITH YOUR HEAD, THAT YOUR NEIGHBORS CAN’T POSSIBLY BE AS EVIL AS DEPICTED. LUCKILY, WE INSTALLED SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AROUND YOUR PROPERTY.*

 

*Do I even wanna see this?* Vic wondered, but it was already too late. The footage was playing; his fate was sealed. 

 

The first clip exhibited his house from a top-of-the-streetlight angle. A kid wearing a sideways visor, his tank top reading *ILL SON*, spray-painted a message across Vic’s front door: *DICKENS Z BUTT*. Though crudely immature, that one made Vic chuckle. 

 

The next angle came from Vic’s front lawn palm tree, evident from the fronds framing the clip. This one was no laughing matter. It featured one of his Hispanic neighbors reclining in Vic’s yard, staring up at Vic’s window. The man was in a centerfold pose—one leg thrown over the other, propped up on one elbow, gripping his back cranium. His mustache was thick and slimy, like black conjoined slug twins.  

 

*Christ, is this dude* *trying to seduce me?* Vic wondered, shuddering. The footage went time-lapse—cars speeding by, day turning to night—with the man locked in that position. Vic wanted to scream, felt himself shivering out of his own skin.

 

The clips continued. In quick succession, he watched a woman he didn’t recognize instruct her Shih Tzu to defecate upon his lawn, Knut’s brother angrily pounding his door—most likely seeking confrontation—and a middle schooler neighbor snatch a package off of his doormat. *Aw, man. Those were the John Carpenter Blu-rays I ordered. I wonder if Amazon will send replacements.* 

 

Mercifully, the clips ended. *I know what I’ll do,* Vic thought, *I’ll give this presentation to the cops. They’ll have to do something, won’t they?* Then he remembered a complaining comic shop customer, who’d recently had his iPhone stolen. Using the Find My iPhone feature, he’d tracked the device to the thief’s house, only to have the cops inform him that they couldn’t do anything about it. “They were too busy shootin’ black jaywalkers,” Mr. Man Tits had declared, storming out with a bag of vintage manga.   

 

Now the text read: *CHECK THE STORAGE CABINET, VICTOR. WE CAN’T LET YOU LEAVE WITHOUT A COUPLE OF PARTING GIFTS.* 

 

Inside of the cabinet, Vic discovered a firearm—a Ruger SP101 double-action revolver—nestled within two-dozen boxes of .357 Magnum rounds. Lifting the gun, he found that it had a reassuring heft to it. 

 

He tucked it into his waistband, and pulled it back out just as quick. *Christ, I forgot to check if the thing is loaded. I could have blown my own nuts off.* Checking the five-round chamber, as he’d seen done in countless action flicks, he saw that it was filled.     

 

In the next drawer down, there was an empty black Samsonite duffle bag. *Ah, what the hell?* Vic thought, tossing the Ruger and its rounds into it. Beneath the bullets, he discovered a key and a magnetic key card. 

 

Now the computer screen read: *YOUR HOUSE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, VICTOR. WHY DON’T YOU COME STAY WITH US? SHOULD YOU ACCEPT IT, THAT KEY BELONGS TO YOUR OWN PRIVATE APARTMENT, WITHIN A COMPLEX EXCLUSIVE TO THE SILENT MINORITY. THE KEY CARD WILL GET YOU INTO THE PARKING LOT. YOUR APARTMENT NUMBER IS 24, AS IS YOUR PARKING SPACE. GOODBYE, VICTOR. TRY NOT TO DISTURB ANYONE ON THE WAY OUT. WE’LL BE IN TOUCH.* 

 

Shrugging, Vic pocketed the card and key. *I could check the place out, I guess,* he reasoned. *It’s not like I have to live there.* 

 

Before leaving, he compressed the presentation, and emailed it to his Gmail account. *A little reassurance*, he thought. *I’ll send this file to Last Words, Inc. later, just like that first recording, so that it reaches the news, the cops, and my parents if I die. The neighbors might manage to kill me, but even the police won’t be able to ignore evidence in a murder case. If I’m going down, I’m taking those assholes with me. Yeah, fuck ’em.* 



 

**Chapter 5**

 

His destination was printed on the keycard. Vic fished his cellphone from his glove box, replaced its battery, and punched the address into his route planning app. 

 

His bladder throbbed. *I should have checked that place for a bathroom,* he realized. The route planner estimated a seventeen-minute drive. *At least the apartment complex isn’t far.*

 

Passing through a seedy neighborhood, he saw hookers and street toughs staring slack-jawed from stoops. One prostitute caught his eye. Her arms were bruised and track-marked, her hair missing sizable clumps. Her face appeared to have been sandblasted, and then slapped with a pepperoni pizza. 

 

Briefly, Vic visualized the past, to glimpse the teenage beauty queen lurking beneath time’s ravages. *Once, she was the sort of chick that guys would tear their hearts out for, just to toss at her feet. Or maybe they’d just write terrible poetry, to leave in envelopes ’neath her doormat.*

 

*Why must people destroy everything beautiful?* he wondered. Glancing at the passenger seat duffle bag, he fought the urge to withdraw the Ruger and start blasting away. 

 

When four stoop-dwellers began stumbling toward him, their faces amphetamine-warped, Vic realized that he’d been coasting at too leisurely a pace. Mashing the accelerator, he heard shouted threats fading and glass bottles shattering.    

 

Finally, he found the address, situated between a smoke shop and an adult school. If the complex had a name, there was no sign to proclaim it. Utilizing the keycard, Vic claimed his private lot parking space, and emerged bent on exploration. 

 

Instead of heading directly for the stairwell, he decided to survey the grounds. The complex comprised six low-rise buildings, with a well-kept courtyard at their epicenter. 

 

The courtyard was a site most majestic, featuring masonry arches, bubbling fountains, and a goldfish pond. Its garden was extensive, including prime specimens of Silverbush, star magnolia, and French lavender. Apartments encircled the courtyard entirely. Each building had its own entrance. 

 

With the place being so tranquil, Vic was shocked to find it empty. *Where are all the other introverts?* he wondered. *Is the complex new? Or are they in hiding, terrified by the possibility of social interaction?* There had been other vehicles in the parking garage, but perhaps they’d been abandoned.

 

*Fuck it*, he thought. *Time to check out my apartment. My apartment. Christ, have I already decided to live here, and just now figured it out? Slow down, buddy.*

 

Consulting a freestanding floor plan display, Vic located his place. It was fully furnished: leather couches, king-sized bed, oven, microwave, vertical blinds, etc. 

 

“Holy shit, is that a 4K TV?” It was, all seventy inches of it. 

 

Had somebody on the street uttered the word “apartment” to Vic, he would have pictured something eerily similar to his current surroundings. Carpeted floors, ceiling fan, mirrored closet doors, and an air conditioner—yeah, Vic could see himself living there. The only thing missing was a phone. There wasn’t even a jack present. 

 

He sat on the couch. *Damn, that’s comfortable.* He flicked the TV on. *Free HBO…nice. And they’re just giving this place to me? That can’t be right.* 

 

*There has to be something they’re not telling me,* he thought. *I need to leave right now, and head back to my real home before I wake up with my kidney stolen. Get up, Vic. Get outta here, ya stupid bastard.* He didn’t move. Having spent too many frantic hours living out of his car like a fugitive, it was difficult to abandon fresh comfort. *Well, I guess that I can stay a little longer. I’ll go home tomorrow morning, and think things over.* 

 

He found the refrigerator fully stocked: Eggo waffles, sandwich makings, milk, orange juice and steaks—it was incredible. And beer, plenty of beer. 

 

“Hey, now we’re talkin’.”

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Twenty-four hours later, he still hadn’t left. Instead, he studied his *DAY OF THE INTROVERT* pamphlet, reading it over and over, seeking the meaning behind the words. 

 

The more that he read it, the more suspicious Vic became. Sure, the underlying argument still connected, but there was something about the writing style that set him on edge. With the short paragraphs—a space between each one—and the catchy all-caps subheadings, it read as if a copywriter had written it, as if cynicism suffused the text. Or maybe Vic was just paranoid, as anyone would be in such bizarre circumstances. 

 

He hadn’t been contacted by the Silent Minority, hadn’t glimpsed or overheard a single neighbor. It was nice, but he was growing bored. He needed his computer, his books, and his videogames. *Maybe I’ll get them tomorrow.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

A week later, Vic finally encountered his first Silent Minority neighbor. She was anemic, sloop-shouldered and acne-ridden, and lived across the hall. One morning, he spotted her lugging an overstuffed trash bag down the stairs, her awkward grasp permitting it to split. 

 

“Here, let me help you with that,” he said, as its contents began spilling. She offered no reply, but allowed him to place supportive palms beneath her burden. Together, they tossed it into the parking garage dumpster, but not before Vic noticed something curious. 

 

“Hey, was that an entire turkey in there?” 

 

She nodded. 

 

“And biscuits, peas, corn and stuffing, all uneaten?”

 

She nodded again.

 

“You just threw away a Thanksgiving dinner?”

 

Yeah, you guessed it: another nod. 

 

“Why?” 

 

She shrugged, and then sprinted away, disappearing up the staircase like a fireworks-spooked feline. Salivating, Vic looked to the dumpster. *Maybe a cat peed on it,* he rationalized. *I mean, there’s got to be something up with that food. Nobody would just garbage-chuck a feast, would they?*  

 

He began revisiting the dumpster, day after day, flashlight-shining to seek out fresh refuse. Two days later, he saw three thick-cut, pan-fried steaks, plus asparagus and fully loaded baked potatoes, all intact. Three days after that, he saw Cajun-style shrimp and catfish, plus rice and red beans—restaurant quality. 

 

After a lifetime of withering under the public eye, Vic understood the sacredness of privacy. But now, for the first time ever, he caught a dose of that fascination so long turned against him: the itch to comprehend an inexplicable individual. Crouching behind the dumpster for thirty-seven hours straight, sustained on coffee and granola bars, he realized that he was nearly as bad as his persecutors. The sole difference: he didn’t wish to harm his introvert. 

 

*Why don’t I just knock on her door?* he wondered. *No, I don’t want to put her guard up. This needs to seem like a chance meeting, not some kind of home invasion.*

 

His eyes closed, only to pop back open as a trash bag thumped heavily. He sprang to his feet, and leapt into the girl’s vision space. She opened her mouth and jumped back, but voiced no scream. Her eyes were large and round above fear-widened nostrils. 

 

“No, don’t be afraid,” he said. “I accidentally tossed my bag over the bin.” 

 

*Yeah, she’s not buying it.* 

 

He peered at her discards—spaghetti and meatballs, thick slabs of garlic bread. Looking away from the repast, he saw the girl retreating. 

 

“Hey, wait up a second!” he called, hurrying after her. “Oof, you’re like greased lightning. C’mon, I just wanna talk.”

 

As she fumbled with her apartment key, he caught up to her. *Leave her alone, Vic*, he scolded himself. *You’re just one erection away from being a rapist right now.* But he’d already gone too far. He’d be getting his answers, or at least a home cooked meal. 

 

Grabbing her shoulder, he twirled the girl toward him. “Seriously, don’t be like that. It’s just…I don’t get it. Why do you keep throwin’ away all these incredible meals? Do you ever take a bite? I mean, what do you eat, if you’re always garbage-tossin’ your meals?”

 

Her mouth dropped in slack-jawed indignation. *Oh, I’m in for it now*, he thought. *This girl’s gonna give me a piece of her mind.* Instead, she just gaped. *Hey, why isn’t she saying anything? Why’s her mouth look so funny? Oh, she doesn’t have a tongue.* 

 

Vic grew contrite. “Hey, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to assault you. I guess you think that I’m some kind of maniac.”

 

She nodded. 

 

“Yeah, I don’t blame you. But if there’s nothing wrong with the food, maybe you could share some with me. I mean, it’s gotta be better than just tossing it all, and I can’t cook for shit.”  

 

Instead of nodding or giving a thumbs-down, the girl turned away. This time, when she twisted her doorknob, Vic let her. *Does she even speak English?* he wondered. *Maybe those trash meals were just practice, and she only eats human flesh. Man, I hope that I don’t wake up inside a giant basting pan one morning, with her standing there naked, brushing butter onto me. Actually, that sounds kind of hot. If she didn’t cook me afterward, it could be an interesting bit of kink.* 

 

Shaking his head to clear away erotic imagery, Vic returned to his own place. *Do I have anything left to eat?* he wondered. *I know I finished off that last steak, but maybe there’s some lunchmeat left.* 

 

His worries were unnecessary. While he’d been out, some unknown benefactor had restocked Vic’s fridge. There was even cake this time. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Two days later, Vic sat watching daytime television, bored out of his skull. He’d yet to return to his real house, mostly out of fear of his neighbors. He had, however, called Mr. Ogden—claiming illness, begging to keep his job. His employer hemmed and hawed, before telling Vic to be there on Monday, come Hell or necrotizing fasciitis.

 

Without his computer, masturbation had become perfunctory, a fantasy-free chore no different from defecation. Without his Blu-rays, he was limited to whatever crap the cable companies offered, and thus rewatched Michael Bay movies he’d hated on the first viewing.   

 

At the Silent Minority complex, everything was free: housing, food, electricity, water, and cable television. But they never gave him any money, presumably to limit his contact with the outside world. *Classic cult tactics,* he thought. *Leave me penniless, so that the Silent Minority becomes my entire universe. They want me completely dependent on them, but I’m not falling for that shit. Sure, I’ll stay in this free apartment, but the second that they pull some Manson family bullshit, I’m out of here.* 

 

*At any rate, it’s time I got back to the neighborhood. Isolation is one thing, but separation from one’s stuff is like prison. I’ll bring the revolver this time, in case one of those assholes fucks with me. Let them try to change my name to Victim; I’ll shoot their fuckin’ brains out.* 

 

There was a knock at the door. Vic found the hallway empty, but something had been left on his doorstep: a serving tray, its contents hidden beneath silver cloches. Vic took the tray inside. Beneath the domes he found breakfast. 

 

One bowl contained corned beef hash, topped by a fried egg. Upon a plate, there were pancakes, drowning in butter and syrup. There was bacon and buttered toast, silverware and a napkin. The scent was irresistible. 

 

*That girl,* he thought, smiling. *If she keeps this up, I’ll be morbidly obese in no time.* 

 

Vic ate until his stomach hurt, stored the leftovers in his fridge, and washed the dishes and flatware. When they were sparkling clean, he left everything on his neighbor’s doorstep. On one of the cloches, he affixed a Post-it message: *THANKS FOR THE FOOD. IT WAS DELICIOUS. IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, PLEASE DON’T HESITATE TO ASK.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Having finally returned to Turquoise Street, Vic inspected fresh front door graffiti. *DICKENS Z BUTT* had been joined by four swastikas, and the phrases *DIE JEW!* and *BITCH BOY*.    

 

*They’ve decided I’m Jewish now?* Vic wondered, followed by, *People are still prejudiced against them?* 

 

The purloined Amazon package had returned to his doorstep, now open. Within it, he glimpsed his John Carpenter Blu-rays—*The Thing, In the Mouth of Madness,* and *Prince of Darkness*—out of their cases, upside down, and knife-scratched so that they’d never play. Something had been left atop them. 

 

*Jeez, is that animal or human?* Vic considered. *Man, Amazon will never take those back now.* 

 

Abhorrence twisting his features, Knut’s brother glared from the Jansson driveway. He was loading up a U-Haul. Their lawn displayed a *FOR SALE* sign.

 

*Yeah, fuck you*, Vic mouthed, squinting at the flush-faced Swede. The man looked ready to throw down his boxed-up dishware and grab the nearest hacksaw, but Vic wasn’t worried. He had the Ruger in his pocket, and extra rounds in his car.   

 

Leaving the package on his doorstep, he went inside. The musty interior made him sneeze. But that was okay. He didn’t plan to stay long. 

 

He pulled the Ruger from his pocket, pointed it toward the Jansson house, and pantomimed squeezing the trigger. The gun seemed to possess its own negative karma, bad vibes demanding senseless slaughter. Vic wondered if it had killed before, if ghosts whispered in its barrel at night. He repocketed the firearm. 

 

A cry came from his backyard, a sorority girl’s “Whooooooo!” But it was no college temptress that met Vic’s parted-blinds view, but a middle-aged woman, topless, shaking her withered teats left to right, right to left. Four men cheered her on—one with a needle in his arm, a belt tied above it—as another scag hag vomited in the bushes. There were whiskey bottles and empty baggies. A boombox blasted country music. 

 

Vic didn’t recognize any of them. *Christ, what the hell is going on here?* he wondered. *Are they squatting? It doesn’t look like they’ve been inside.* 

 

He moved his Taurus inside the garage. He didn’t want his neighbors to see him packing, to know that they’d driven him out. *Let them think that I’m here all day, watching them, plotting. Serves those assholes right.* 

 

He boxed up his computer, Blu-rays, books and comics. The collection was so comprehensive that it filled his car entirely, leaving barely enough space to climb behind the wheel. 

 

Before leaving, Vic called 911. “Yeah, I’ve got some trespassers in my backyard. The address is 1412 Turquoise Street. I think they’re doing heroin.” He hung up, hoping that that the investigating officers proved trigger-happy. 

 

Leaving the neighborhood, he encountered Knut’s brother. Standing mid-street, the man gripped a baseball bat, which dripped milk onto the asphalt, indicating that he’d battered a couple of cartons to psyche himself up. 

 

Vic pulled aside him, his window down, the gun pointing. “What’s up, fucko?” he asked. “Did your *Dream for a Day* become a nightmare?”

 

Understanding dawned. “You…I knew it,” the man sputtered.

 

“Yeah, I smote that demon. Good luck trying to prove it.” 

 

The man’s goatee seemed to grey. Throwing himself forward, he drew the bat back for a swing. But Vic was already in motion, speeding from the accursed neighborhood. Shouted threats faded in the distance, as he began to laugh. ",1,1770729940.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The car radio played:

 

*Bend down, baby, kiss the floor*

*Twerk it like a Hill Street whore*

*Bitch gon’ make me nut some more*

*Bitch gon’ make me nut some more*

 

Vic switched to silence. *Seriously?* he thought. *Mainstream hip-hop isn’t even trying anymore. Pretty soon they’ll just be grunting and burping over the beat: uh-huh, uh-huh-huh. As long as girls can dance to it, I doubt that anyone will even notice.*  

 

His thoughts twisted toward the day’s newspaper, now stashed beneath the passenger seat. He’d purchased it an hour prior, panicking in a convenience store parking lot, before finally mustering the courage to step inside the establishment. Living in his car, eating nothing but fast food while eschewing the comforts of running water, had left him grimy and reeking, just one small step above a vagrant. 

 

Waiting in the convenience store line, clutching a disgusting microwaved breakfast sandwich and a Powerade, he’d noticed two girls staring from the wine racks. One looked familiar—pretty but not overtly so—a face half-remembered from high school hallways. 

 

Unsure whether he was a fugitive or not, Vic felt horribly exposed in their proximity. Carefully putting his back to the ladies, he’d adopted a relaxed posture, and watched the ahead-of-him customers toss money to the cashier. Still, he’d caught the girls’ attention. 

 

“Hey, Megs, isn’t that the guy…you know, the weird one? Remember, that jerkoff who found his locker filled with used diapers during Spirit Week?”

 

Vic felt himself blushing, as shameful memories resurfaced. 

 

“Oh, yeah, I remember now. Didn’t the lacrosse team do that?”

 

“I think so. Man, what a freak.”

 

“Capital ‘L’ Loser, for sure. He *is* kind of cute, though. I wonder if he’s gay or just socially retarded.”

 

“I don’t know. Either way, he *definitely* still lives with his mother.”

 

The females cackled like octogenarian crones. Vic wanted to flee to the parking lot, but knew that bolting would only make the girls laugh harder. 

 

“I wonder if he knows that we’re talking about him,” Megs chortled. 

 

*No, bitch, I’m deaf*, he’d thought, wanting to scream it. Still, all things considered, at least they hadn’t mentioned a murder. If Vic was a suspect, it seemed that the media hadn’t reported it. 

 

At the register, he snatched up a newspaper, handed over a twenty, and waited for the cashier to count out change. Glancing back toward the wine racks, he’d seen the females staring, their eyes suffused with merriment. “Fuck ’em,” he’d muttered, exiting into open air.            

 

Subsequently studying the newspaper, Vic had read something that sent Powerade spraying from his face hole. Knut Jansson’s murderer *had* been caught, it reported. During a burglary gone wrong, Hutch Sampson, a local boxing instructor, stabbed-stabbed-stabbed and fled. He’d left some trace evidence behind—hair and unspecified fibers—and had no alibi for the time of murder. 

 

The arrest photo featured a scowling crew cut above a neck like a waterlogged tree trunk. *Who is this dude?* Vic had wondered. *Did the Silent Minority frame him? They wrote that they’d keep my secret, but never mentioned anything like this.* 

 

He’d peered closer. With the image mere centimeters from his scrutiny, in Sampson’s eyes, Vic had beheld rage and confusion consolidated, menace scarcely subdued. His lips were swollen and split. A bruise marked his right cheek, indicating that he’d resisted arrest. *Who is this dude?*

 

He turned onto Reginald Court. *Wow, what a depressing street*, Vic thought. Starving felines straggled through barren lots, their open sores leaking. Dirty-faced children rode bicycles over dirt bumps. Drug-bleared mothers populated picnic benches, scrutinizing their own infants as if they were extraterrestrials. There’d been a community there once, indicated by the many condemned houses and burnt-out storefronts. Now, only squatters and liquor stores remained. 

 

1414 was past the desolation, behind an open security gate, and consisted of a parking lot housing two-dozen vehicles, and an ugly prefabricated steel warehouse, painted sky blue. If the firmament that morning hadn’t been grey and cloud-plagued, the squat structure might have benefited from chameleon-like camouflage, and appeared less like an overturned cereal box.       

 

Vic parked. Somebody lurked at the warehouse’s rolled-up shutter door, and so Vic trudged over to greet him. Drawing closer, Vic realized that a surgical mask concealed the man’s mouth and nose. Closer still, and he saw that the mask had been painted: two monkey paws over the man’s mouth, homage to Iwazaru, the “speak no evil” ape. 

 

“Uh, hi there,” Vic said. “My name’s Victor Dickens. I was invited here.” 

 

Wordlessly, the man held up a copy of the *DAY OF THE INTROVERT* pamphlet, raising one eyebrow in silent inquiry. 

 

“You…want me to show you my pamphlet? Is that it?”

 

The man nodded. 

 

After a parking lot shuffle, Vic returned with his leaflet. The doorman waved him in.  

 

Vic encountered a table, its surface covered with surgical masks identical to the doorman’s. Beside it, a freestanding sign declared, *TAKE ONE. WEAR IT. YOUR DESIGNATED STATION IS:* There was a list of perhaps forty names, alphabetized. Finger-tracing his way down, Vic found his station: Number 24. 

 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous, Vic donned a mask. 

 

The warehouse’s initial purpose was a mystery. No goods or heavy machinery remained. Now, the building’s interior was filled with cubicles, stretching nearly from wall to wall. Blandly impersonal, each cubicle contained a desktop computer, desk, swivel chair and storage cabinet. Only the side partition numerals distinguished one from another.  

 

Searching out Number 24, Vic passed other occupied cubicles. Their occupants had their backs to him. Wearing headphones, they gawked at computer screens. Nobody spoke, but the silence wasn’t awkward or oppressive. In fact, the hush felt welcoming, like an open prairie at the end of time.  

 

Of the men and women he passed, a number were obese or shockingly thin. Some were albino-white; others emanated a fishy odor indicating Trimethylaminuria. A few seemed perfectly normal, attractive even, at least when glimpsed from behind. All wore surgical masks. 

 

Finally, Vic found his cubicle. Settling into a swivel chair, he turned his focus toward the computer monitor, which displayed a screen saver: a shifting chiaroscuro juxtaposing divine imagery with scenes of demonic torture. *This is just too damn weird*, Vic thought. Still, he jiggled the mouse to clear the screen, and donned the provided headphones. 

 

A prompt box requested identification, and so Vic typed his name, which started up a multimedia presentation.   

 

A flourish of trumpets sounded. Words slid across the screen: *GREETINGS, VICTOR DICKENS*. *WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT KNUT JANSSON’S “MURDERER” HAS BEEN APPREHENDED? YOU’RE WELCOME.* 

 

Hidden camera footage played, featuring a familiar figure inside a boxing gym’s locker room. Hutch Sampson, shirtless, smacked a skinny adolescent around, screaming, “Toughen up, pussy! Toughen up!”

 

*MEET HUTCH SAMPSON*, the text read, *BOXING INSTRUCTOR EXTRAORDINAIRE. FROM THE RING TO THE STREET, THIS PHILANTHROPIC FELLOW IS EVER-EAGER TO PROVIDE YOUNGSTERS WITH A HELPING HAND.*   

 

The scene switched to a back alley, presumably behind the gym. A boy surely no older than twelve, bespectacled, cried as Hutch forced him to eat a dead rodent. 

 

As the scene segued to showcase a battered woman shambling from her home to her car, Vic read, *MEET HUTCH’S GIRLFRIEND*. The woman’s face was contusion-covered, her eyes so swollen that she could scarcely navigate. Her zebra print leggings were bloodstained from the crotch down; her right shoulder hung out of socket. *IT APPEARS THAT SHE NEEDED SOME INSTRUCTION, TOO.* 

 

Hutch barreled into the screen, grabbed the dislocated appendage, and yanked the shrieking female back homeward. With disgusted fascination, Vic noticed that the man sported an erection. 

 

*Holy mackerel,* Vic thought. *And I actually felt bad for this dude.* 

 

*WE DON’T JUST MONITOR PROMISING INTROVERTS, BUT BULLIES AS WELL. IT’S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A FALL GUY, AFTER ALL, AND WE KEEP OUR EARS TO THE GROUND.* 

 

*HAVING MANY FRIENDS ON THE POLICE FORCE, HUTCH WAS PRACTICALLY IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION. THE COMPLAINTS OF HIS VICTIMS AND THEIR PARENTS WENT IGNORED, AND THE MAN CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE NEW STUDENTS. THE JOCKISH ONES WERE PROVIDED ORDINARY LESSONS, BUT THE INTROVERTS…BOY HOWDY! AS FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND, SHE WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO TALK. EVENTUALLY, THE SILENT MINORITY HAD TO STEP IN.* 

 

The screen permitted one final glimpse of Hutch Sampson, collapsing beneath a fusillade of Tasers and truncheons, his blood-painted face howling obscenities at the arresting officers.  

 

*ARE YOU RELIEVED, VICTOR? WELL, DON’T GET TOO COMFORTABLE. YOU STILL HAVE NEIGHBORS, AFTER ALL, AND THEY HATE YOU TREMENDOUSLY. YOUR DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER APPROACH WAS TOO RUDIMENTARY, BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF THEIR MALEVOLENCE. ERGO, WE WENT AHEAD AND BUGGED THEIR HOMES. IT’S NOT HARD TO DO, PROVIDED THAT YOU SHOW UP IN EXTERMINATOR GEAR, AND OFFER THEM A FREE TERMITE INSPECTION. HERE’S WHAT THEY SAID IN YOUR ABSENCE:*  

 

An audio compilation played, voices both familiar and strange. The first sounded like Knut’s brother: “I don’t care what the papers say! That little faggot had something to do with it! I swear to God, I’m gonna set up a noose in Vic’s garage, make it look like he hung himself!”

 

It cut to a conversation between two Hispanic-accented speakers. At first, Vic couldn’t recall any Hispanic neighbors. Then he remembered the two men who resided four houses down from him, who motored to parts unknown inside a grey Toyota truck every morning. 

 

“Victor has no dick, eh?” one asked. “He afraid of pussy?”

 

“Virgin, I think,” the other replied. “Pretty boy, yeah?”

 

The first speaker laughed. “Maybe we cut off his arms and use him for sex slave. White boy only good for fuck puppet, anyway.”

 

“Where we gonna put him when we’re done, homes?”

 

“Deep sea fishing, heh-heh.”

 

Had Vic been drinking something, it would have gone spraying all over the computer screen at that moment. He was aghast, having never considered the sexual connotations of his past victimizations. Had all those meatheads and gossip guys been attracted to him all along, and unable to express it properly? Should he be flattered on some level?    

 

“Ugh,” he grunted, shaking his head to dispel ghastly man-on-man rape visualizations. Even that short exclamation felt blasphemous in his current surroundings, wherein noise only emanated from headphone speakers.  

 

Vic recognized the next voice as Bill’s, considerably more sober than it had been on the digital voice recorder: “We need to teach him a lesson.” 

 

*Well, he could be referring to anybody*, Vic reasoned. Then came, “We’ll take two cars, sandwich his Taurus in so he can’t escape.” 

 

*Yikes*, Vic thought. *Never mind. What did I ever do to you, Bill? In fact, how about I teach you a lesson, dickhead? I won’t use a pencil, but I’ll write it in lead. Damn, that sounded cool in my head, just like an action hero. I wish I’d said it out loud.* Contemplations shifting somber, he frowned. *How many of those fuckers am I gonna have to kill?* 

 

And still they came, varying in gender and age:

 

“That Dickens boy needs therapy.”

 

“I tell you, he likes little kids.”

 

“Let’s wait until he goes to work, drive over a U-Haul, and take everything that faggot Victor owns. Little queerbait probably doesn’t even have insurance.”

 

“We already know he’s unstable.”

 

“What’s he doing in his room, sitting in the dark for two nights in a row?” *I wasn’t even home, you asshole*, Vic might have countered. 

 

Then, most ominously, came five enigmatic words, half-whispered: “We’ll bring Vic the scissors.”

 

*Okay, this is just getting ridiculous*, he thought. *No way could the neighborhood be this obsessed with me. Is the Silent Minority faking this somehow? I didn’t even recognize half of those voices. Seriously, what have I stumbled into? Is this a cult? Am I in a cult right now? Am I being brainwashed?*

 

The text returned: *WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, BIG GUY? YOU’RE PROBABLY SUSPECTING THAT WE’RE MESSING WITH YOUR HEAD, THAT YOUR NEIGHBORS CAN’T POSSIBLY BE AS EVIL AS DEPICTED. LUCKILY, WE INSTALLED SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AROUND YOUR PROPERTY.*

 

*Do I even wanna see this?* Vic wondered, but it was already too late. The footage was playing; his fate was sealed. 

 

The first clip exhibited his house from a top-of-the-streetlight angle. A kid wearing a sideways visor, his tank top reading *ILL SON*, spray-painted a message across Vic’s front door: *DICKENS Z BUTT*. Though crudely immature, that one made Vic chuckle. 

 

The next angle came from Vic’s front lawn palm tree, evident from the fronds framing the clip. This one was no laughing matter. It featured one of his Hispanic neighbors reclining in Vic’s yard, staring up at Vic’s window. The man was in a centerfold pose—one leg thrown over the other, propped up on one elbow, gripping his back cranium. His mustache was thick and slimy, like black conjoined slug twins.  

 

*Christ, is this dude* *trying to seduce me?* Vic wondered, shuddering. The footage went time-lapse—cars speeding by, day turning to night—with the man locked in that position. Vic wanted to scream, felt himself shivering out of his own skin.

 

The clips continued. In quick succession, he watched a woman he didn’t recognize instruct her Shih Tzu to defecate upon his lawn, Knut’s brother angrily pounding his door—most likely seeking confrontation—and a middle schooler neighbor snatch a package off of his doormat. *Aw, man. Those were the John Carpenter Blu-rays I ordered. I wonder if Amazon will send replacements.* 

 

Mercifully, the clips ended. *I know what I’ll do,* Vic thought, *I’ll give this presentation to the cops. They’ll have to do something, won’t they?* Then he remembered a complaining comic shop customer, who’d recently had his iPhone stolen. Using the Find My iPhone feature, he’d tracked the device to the thief’s house, only to have the cops inform him that they couldn’t do anything about it. “They were too busy shootin’ black jaywalkers,” Mr. Man Tits had declared, storming out with a bag of vintage manga.   

 

Now the text read: *CHECK THE STORAGE CABINET, VICTOR. WE CAN’T LET YOU LEAVE WITHOUT A COUPLE OF PARTING GIFTS.* 

 

Inside of the cabinet, Vic discovered a firearm—a Ruger SP101 double-action revolver—nestled within two-dozen boxes of .357 Magnum rounds. Lifting the gun, he found that it had a reassuring heft to it. 

 

He tucked it into his waistband, and pulled it back out just as quick. *Christ, I forgot to check if the thing is loaded. I could have blown my own nuts off.* Checking the five-round chamber, as he’d seen done in countless action flicks, he saw that it was filled.     

 

In the next drawer down, there was an empty black Samsonite duffle bag. *Ah, what the hell?* Vic thought, tossing the Ruger and its rounds into it. Beneath the bullets, he discovered a key and a magnetic key card. 

 

Now the computer screen read: *YOUR HOUSE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, VICTOR. WHY DON’T YOU COME STAY WITH US? SHOULD YOU ACCEPT IT, THAT KEY BELONGS TO YOUR OWN PRIVATE APARTMENT, WITHIN A COMPLEX EXCLUSIVE TO THE SILENT MINORITY. THE KEY CARD WILL GET YOU INTO THE PARKING LOT. YOUR APARTMENT NUMBER IS 24, AS IS YOUR PARKING SPACE. GOODBYE, VICTOR. TRY NOT TO DISTURB ANYONE ON THE WAY OUT. WE’LL BE IN TOUCH.* 

 

Shrugging, Vic pocketed the card and key. *I could check the place out, I guess,* he reasoned. *It’s not like I have to live there.* 

 

Before leaving, he compressed the presentation, and emailed it to his Gmail account. *A little reassurance*, he thought. *I’ll send this file to Last Words, Inc. later, just like that first recording, so that it reaches the news, the cops, and my parents if I die. The neighbors might manage to kill me, but even the police won’t be able to ignore evidence in a murder case. If I’m going down, I’m taking those assholes with me. Yeah, fuck ’em.* 



 

**Chapter 5**

 

His destination was printed on the keycard. Vic fished his cellphone from his glove box, replaced its battery, and punched the address into his route planning app. 

 

His bladder throbbed. *I should have checked that place for a bathroom,* he realized. The route planner estimated a seventeen-minute drive. *At least the apartment complex isn’t far.*

 

Passing through a seedy neighborhood, he saw hookers and street toughs staring slack-jawed from stoops. One prostitute caught his eye. Her arms were bruised and track-marked, her hair missing sizable clumps. Her face appeared to have been sandblasted, and then slapped with a pepperoni pizza. 

 

Briefly, Vic visualized the past, to glimpse the teenage beauty queen lurking beneath time’s ravages. *Once, she was the sort of chick that guys would tear their hearts out for, just to toss at her feet. Or maybe they’d just write terrible poetry, to leave in envelopes ’neath her doormat.*

 

*Why must people destroy everything beautiful?* he wondered. Glancing at the passenger seat duffle bag, he fought the urge to withdraw the Ruger and start blasting away. 

 

When four stoop-dwellers began stumbling toward him, their faces amphetamine-warped, Vic realized that he’d been coasting at too leisurely a pace. Mashing the accelerator, he heard shouted threats fading and glass bottles shattering.    

 

Finally, he found the address, situated between a smoke shop and an adult school. If the complex had a name, there was no sign to proclaim it. Utilizing the keycard, Vic claimed his private lot parking space, and emerged bent on exploration. 

 

Instead of heading directly for the stairwell, he decided to survey the grounds. The complex comprised six low-rise buildings, with a well-kept courtyard at their epicenter. 

 

The courtyard was a site most majestic, featuring masonry arches, bubbling fountains, and a goldfish pond. Its garden was extensive, including prime specimens of Silverbush, star magnolia, and French lavender. Apartments encircled the courtyard entirely. Each building had its own entrance. 

 

With the place being so tranquil, Vic was shocked to find it empty. *Where are all the other introverts?* he wondered. *Is the complex new? Or are they in hiding, terrified by the possibility of social interaction?* There had been other vehicles in the parking garage, but perhaps they’d been abandoned.

 

*Fuck it*, he thought. *Time to check out my apartment. My apartment. Christ, have I already decided to live here, and just now figured it out? Slow down, buddy.*

 

Consulting a freestanding floor plan display, Vic located his place. It was fully furnished: leather couches, king-sized bed, oven, microwave, vertical blinds, etc. 

 

“Holy shit, is that a 4K TV?” It was, all seventy inches of it. 

 

Had somebody on the street uttered the word “apartment” to Vic, he would have pictured something eerily similar to his current surroundings. Carpeted floors, ceiling fan, mirrored closet doors, and an air conditioner—yeah, Vic could see himself living there. The only thing missing was a phone. There wasn’t even a jack present. 

 

He sat on the couch. *Damn, that’s comfortable.* He flicked the TV on. *Free HBO…nice. And they’re just giving this place to me? That can’t be right.* 

 

*There has to be something they’re not telling me,* he thought. *I need to leave right now, and head back to my real home before I wake up with my kidney stolen. Get up, Vic. Get outta here, ya stupid bastard.* He didn’t move. Having spent too many frantic hours living out of his car like a fugitive, it was difficult to abandon fresh comfort. *Well, I guess that I can stay a little longer. I’ll go home tomorrow morning, and think things over.* 

 

He found the refrigerator fully stocked: Eggo waffles, sandwich makings, milk, orange juice and steaks—it was incredible. And beer, plenty of beer. 

 

“Hey, now we’re talkin’.”

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Twenty-four hours later, he still hadn’t left. Instead, he studied his *DAY OF THE INTROVERT* pamphlet, reading it over and over, seeking the meaning behind the words. 

 

The more that he read it, the more suspicious Vic became. Sure, the underlying argument still connected, but there was something about the writing style that set him on edge. With the short paragraphs—a space between each one—and the catchy all-caps subheadings, it read as if a copywriter had written it, as if cynicism suffused the text. Or maybe Vic was just paranoid, as anyone would be in such bizarre circumstances. 

 

He hadn’t been contacted by the Silent Minority, hadn’t glimpsed or overheard a single neighbor. It was nice, but he was growing bored. He needed his computer, his books, and his videogames. *Maybe I’ll get them tomorrow.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

A week later, Vic finally encountered his first Silent Minority neighbor. She was anemic, sloop-shouldered and acne-ridden, and lived across the hall. One morning, he spotted her lugging an overstuffed trash bag down the stairs, her awkward grasp permitting it to split. 

 

“Here, let me help you with that,” he said, as its contents began spilling. She offered no reply, but allowed him to place supportive palms beneath her burden. Together, they tossed it into the parking garage dumpster, but not before Vic noticed something curious. 

 

“Hey, was that an entire turkey in there?” 

 

She nodded. 

 

“And biscuits, peas, corn and stuffing, all uneaten?”

 

She nodded again.

 

“You just threw away a Thanksgiving dinner?”

 

Yeah, you guessed it: another nod. 

 

“Why?” 

 

She shrugged, and then sprinted away, disappearing up the staircase like a fireworks-spooked feline. Salivating, Vic looked to the dumpster. *Maybe a cat peed on it,* he rationalized. *I mean, there’s got to be something up with that food. Nobody would just garbage-chuck a feast, would they?*  

 

He began revisiting the dumpster, day after day, flashlight-shining to seek out fresh refuse. Two days later, he saw three thick-cut, pan-fried steaks, plus asparagus and fully loaded baked potatoes, all intact. Three days after that, he saw Cajun-style shrimp and catfish, plus rice and red beans—restaurant quality. 

 

After a lifetime of withering under the public eye, Vic understood the sacredness of privacy. But now, for the first time ever, he caught a dose of that fascination so long turned against him: the itch to comprehend an inexplicable individual. Crouching behind the dumpster for thirty-seven hours straight, sustained on coffee and granola bars, he realized that he was nearly as bad as his persecutors. The sole difference: he didn’t wish to harm his introvert. 

 

*Why don’t I just knock on her door?* he wondered. *No, I don’t want to put her guard up. This needs to seem like a chance meeting, not some kind of home invasion.*

 

His eyes closed, only to pop back open as a trash bag thumped heavily. He sprang to his feet, and leapt into the girl’s vision space. She opened her mouth and jumped back, but voiced no scream. Her eyes were large and round above fear-widened nostrils. 

 

“No, don’t be afraid,” he said. “I accidentally tossed my bag over the bin.” 

 

*Yeah, she’s not buying it.* 

 

He peered at her discards—spaghetti and meatballs, thick slabs of garlic bread. Looking away from the repast, he saw the girl retreating. 

 

“Hey, wait up a second!” he called, hurrying after her. “Oof, you’re like greased lightning. C’mon, I just wanna talk.”

 

As she fumbled with her apartment key, he caught up to her. *Leave her alone, Vic*, he scolded himself. *You’re just one erection away from being a rapist right now.* But he’d already gone too far. He’d be getting his answers, or at least a home cooked meal. 

 

Grabbing her shoulder, he twirled the girl toward him. “Seriously, don’t be like that. It’s just…I don’t get it. Why do you keep throwin’ away all these incredible meals? Do you ever take a bite? I mean, what do you eat, if you’re always garbage-tossin’ your meals?”

 

Her mouth dropped in slack-jawed indignation. *Oh, I’m in for it now*, he thought. *This girl’s gonna give me a piece of her mind.* Instead, she just gaped. *Hey, why isn’t she saying anything? Why’s her mouth look so funny? Oh, she doesn’t have a tongue.* 

 

Vic grew contrite. “Hey, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to assault you. I guess you think that I’m some kind of maniac.”

 

She nodded. 

 

“Yeah, I don’t blame you. But if there’s nothing wrong with the food, maybe you could share some with me. I mean, it’s gotta be better than just tossing it all, and I can’t cook for shit.”  

 

Instead of nodding or giving a thumbs-down, the girl turned away. This time, when she twisted her doorknob, Vic let her. *Does she even speak English?* he wondered. *Maybe those trash meals were just practice, and she only eats human flesh. Man, I hope that I don’t wake up inside a giant basting pan one morning, with her standing there naked, brushing butter onto me. Actually, that sounds kind of hot. If she didn’t cook me afterward, it could be an interesting bit of kink.* 

 

Shaking his head to clear away erotic imagery, Vic returned to his own place. *Do I have anything left to eat?* he wondered. *I know I finished off that last steak, but maybe there’s some lunchmeat left.* 

 

His worries were unnecessary. While he’d been out, some unknown benefactor had restocked Vic’s fridge. There was even cake this time. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Two days later, Vic sat watching daytime television, bored out of his skull. He’d yet to return to his real house, mostly out of fear of his neighbors. He had, however, called Mr. Ogden—claiming illness, begging to keep his job. His employer hemmed and hawed, before telling Vic to be there on Monday, come Hell or necrotizing fasciitis.

 

Without his computer, masturbation had become perfunctory, a fantasy-free chore no different from defecation. Without his Blu-rays, he was limited to whatever crap the cable companies offered, and thus rewatched Michael Bay movies he’d hated on the first viewing.   

 

At the Silent Minority complex, everything was free: housing, food, electricity, water, and cable television. But they never gave him any money, presumably to limit his contact with the outside world. *Classic cult tactics,* he thought. *Leave me penniless, so that the Silent Minority becomes my entire universe. They want me completely dependent on them, but I’m not falling for that shit. Sure, I’ll stay in this free apartment, but the second that they pull some Manson family bullshit, I’m out of here.* 

 

*At any rate, it’s time I got back to the neighborhood. Isolation is one thing, but separation from one’s stuff is like prison. I’ll bring the revolver this time, in case one of those assholes fucks with me. Let them try to change my name to Victim; I’ll shoot their fuckin’ brains out.* 

 

There was a knock at the door. Vic found the hallway empty, but something had been left on his doorstep: a serving tray, its contents hidden beneath silver cloches. Vic took the tray inside. Beneath the domes he found breakfast. 

 

One bowl contained corned beef hash, topped by a fried egg. Upon a plate, there were pancakes, drowning in butter and syrup. There was bacon and buttered toast, silverware and a napkin. The scent was irresistible. 

 

*That girl,* he thought, smiling. *If she keeps this up, I’ll be morbidly obese in no time.* 

 

Vic ate until his stomach hurt, stored the leftovers in his fridge, and washed the dishes and flatware. When they were sparkling clean, he left everything on his neighbor’s doorstep. On one of the cloches, he affixed a Post-it message: *THANKS FOR THE FOOD. IT WAS DELICIOUS. IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, PLEASE DON’T HESITATE TO ASK.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Having finally returned to Turquoise Street, Vic inspected fresh front door graffiti. *DICKENS Z BUTT* had been joined by four swastikas, and the phrases *DIE JEW!* and *BITCH BOY*.    

 

*They’ve decided I’m Jewish now?* Vic wondered, followed by, *People are still prejudiced against them?* 

 

The purloined Amazon package had returned to his doorstep, now open. Within it, he glimpsed his John Carpenter Blu-rays—*The Thing, In the Mouth of Madness,* and *Prince of Darkness*—out of their cases, upside down, and knife-scratched so that they’d never play. Something had been left atop them. 

 

*Jeez, is that animal or human?* Vic considered. *Man, Amazon will never take those back now.* 

 

Abhorrence twisting his features, Knut’s brother glared from the Jansson driveway. He was loading up a U-Haul. Their lawn displayed a *FOR SALE* sign.

 

*Yeah, fuck you*, Vic mouthed, squinting at the flush-faced Swede. The man looked ready to throw down his boxed-up dishware and grab the nearest hacksaw, but Vic wasn’t worried. He had the Ruger in his pocket, and extra rounds in his car.   

 

Leaving the package on his doorstep, he went inside. The musty interior made him sneeze. But that was okay. He didn’t plan to stay long. 

 

He pulled the Ruger from his pocket, pointed it toward the Jansson house, and pantomimed squeezing the trigger. The gun seemed to possess its own negative karma, bad vibes demanding senseless slaughter. Vic wondered if it had killed before, if ghosts whispered in its barrel at night. He repocketed the firearm. 

 

A cry came from his backyard, a sorority girl’s “Whooooooo!” But it was no college temptress that met Vic’s parted-blinds view, but a middle-aged woman, topless, shaking her withered teats left to right, right to left. Four men cheered her on—one with a needle in his arm, a belt tied above it—as another scag hag vomited in the bushes. There were whiskey bottles and empty baggies. A boombox blasted country music. 

 

Vic didn’t recognize any of them. *Christ, what the hell is going on here?* he wondered. *Are they squatting? It doesn’t look like they’ve been inside.* 

 

He moved his Taurus inside the garage. He didn’t want his neighbors to see him packing, to know that they’d driven him out. *Let them think that I’m here all day, watching them, plotting. Serves those assholes right.* 

 

He boxed up his computer, Blu-rays, books and comics. The collection was so comprehensive that it filled his car entirely, leaving barely enough space to climb behind the wheel. 

 

Before leaving, Vic called 911. “Yeah, I’ve got some trespassers in my backyard. The address is 1412 Turquoise Street. I think they’re doing heroin.” He hung up, hoping that that the investigating officers proved trigger-happy. 

 

Leaving the neighborhood, he encountered Knut’s brother. Standing mid-street, the man gripped a baseball bat, which dripped milk onto the asphalt, indicating that he’d battered a couple of cartons to psyche himself up. 

 

Vic pulled aside him, his window down, the gun pointing. “What’s up, fucko?” he asked. “Did your *Dream for a Day* become a nightmare?”

 

Understanding dawned. “You…I knew it,” the man sputtered.

 

“Yeah, I smote that demon. Good luck trying to prove it.” 

 

The man’s goatee seemed to grey. Throwing himself forward, he drew the bat back for a swing. But Vic was already in motion, speeding from the accursed neighborhood. Shouted threats faded in the distance, as he began to laugh. ",3,1770729897.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1r10n8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1r10n8d/california_sober_by_philip_loyd/,California Sober by Philip Loyd,"With special guest star, Chemise Lacoste. Also, special guest appearances by Ted Handsome and Fletch…  

My last acid trip: it wasn’t good. In fact, it was a total disaster. California sober, my ass.

I had just come from the Grateful Dead concert and was having so much fun I wasn’t ready to come down yet. Ever! If you’ve ever been to a Dead show, you know exactly what I’m talking about.

The thing is, I drink too much. Always have. In fact, back when I was growing up it was the thing to do. Quite simply: you weren’t a man if you didn’t drink. Not so much smoking. Drinking.

We did other things, too. In college. Mostly weed, but sometimes mushrooms, hash, and on occasion, LSD. We certainly weren’t shy about trying new things, but mostly it was booze. Why not? It’s legal. In fact, back when I was growing up the drinking age was eighteen.

Don’t get me wrong; I love drinking. I love everything about it, from the smooth taste going in to the burning sensation going down. Of course, I get all the good parts. Anything negative, my brain just blacks it out. I have heard, on occasion, that I drink too much. My apologies in advance.

Drinking was fine when I was young, Cool, even. But now that I’m on the down side of middle age, it’s kind of pathetic. Old drunks, like old rock ‘n roll stars, just don’t look very good.

Still, I had no plans on quitting. So when my brother from another mother Ted Handsome called me to go to the Grateful Dead show, I was on the next flight out. I always fly first class. Not because I’m loaded or that I think I’m too good to fly coach. No, it’s because I drink so much. It just makes financial sense, flying first class. Free food, and you get your own bathroom.

So there we were at the Grateful Dead concert, the old gang together again. What was left of it, anyway. It was me, Ted Handsome and another brother from a another mother, I.M. Fletcher. His real name is Irwin, but we all call him Fletch.

Fletch is from California. And not just anywhere in California, but Carmel-By-the-Sea. It doesn’t get any more California than that.

So when Fletch proposed that we not drink, I thought it was just another one of his crazy California ideas. It was!

Not drink? You mean not at all?

He called it California Sober, and it’s an actual thing. Only in this instance, Fletch put his own twist on it, calling it San Francisco Sober because instead of smoking weed, the diet consists mainly of dropping acid. I hadn’t done LSD in years.

At my age, just the thought of taking acid made me tired. There’s no way I got the energy to go through all that. “Oh, I don’t know,” I told them. “I mean, I’ve got enough problems with the booze and all.”

Then, like they always do, they talked me into it.

“That didn’t take too much convincing,” said Ted. It never did.

What the hell, I thought. Why not? I like trying new things, and like I said, my drinking, while not out of control, was definitely becoming a burden. More and more these days, there were black eyes and dented fenders. I was running out of excuses to tell my wife.

California sober, huh? With a San Francisco twist? Let’s do it.

So we gave it a whirl and I’m happy to report that the whole weekend was a resounding victory . Great success! I hadn’t done acid since college but I got right back up on that horse. It was amazing, and it didn’t make me tired at all. My first acid trip in years was a bonafide triumph. Even Ted agreed.

Fletch said while he’d love to take credit for California Sober, and even San Francisco Sober, they were both already a thing. In some instances, he said, you can switch out LSD for mushrooms, or mescaline, or dimethyltryptamine, or ololiuqui, or any other hallucinogen. You can even smoke a little weed, but no alcohol. NO BOOZE!!! Okay, I get it.

I was a new man. The whole flight home, I spread the word. And since I wouldn’t be drinking anymore, I traded in my first class ticket for coach and the people sitting next to me wished I hadn’t because I didn’t shut up the whole flight. I went on and on like some kind of tweaker, all about California Sober with a San Francisco twist. Maybe it wasn’t so much the booze, after all.

I didn’t want the good times to end. Who does? So I brought home what was left of the acid—at TSA, they let the LSD go through, but they confiscated my shampoo—and the first thing I did when I got home was call up my good friend Chemise Lacoste. It’s not enough just to go California Sober, you’ve got to spread the word as well.

So I call up Chemise Lacoste because A) we were long overdue, and B) he had just been dumped by his girlfriend. Making matters worse, they were living together. And, his car broke down. Fuck!

Lacoste had never been to a Dead show, so that part of the experience I would have to recreate. We had done acid together in college, but for him, like me, it had been a long time. When I mentioned it to him, however, he was totally in. “I’ll try just about anything right now,” he said. Poor guy.

But this was going to be good for him. Chemise Lacoste drinks too much. We all do. Not only was this the perfect opportunity for him to try something that didn’t involve alcohol, but it was a great chance to extend my spiritual journey, as well as bring somebody new along the way. Because after all, isn’t that what it’s all about? Spreading the word? Sending out the love?

So we came up with this plan. “It’s called California Sober,” I told him. “That means there is no alcohol allowed.”

“No alcohol?”

That’s right, I told him. None. Not even a drop.

“Okay,” he said. “If you say so.”

I do say so.

“You’re just going to have to trust me,” I told him.

So we made a plan to go out to his family’s cabin. Seclusion, in this instance, was key.

The house used to be his grandmothers and it was falling apart all over the place. Good. That’s just how we liked it. Truth is, this house was built cheap even for a hundred years ago.

But it was perfect because nobody went there anymore. Nobody. Besides seclusion, to go California Sober you need privacy. That means making sure nobody from the sober world suddenly shows up and throws the whole thing into disarray. No chance of that here; the whole Lacoste family was pretty much dead and gone.

Besides peace and quiet, the seclusion makes it possible to get as loud as you want, another key factor in going California Sober.

We stocked up on water and sodas and fresh fruit. Anything cold and refreshing. We had steaks and coffee for after. It was going to be a great weekend seeing my old friend Chemise Lacoste, and rocking out to some great tunes. And no, this was not any kind of detox. This was a fun weekend, plain and simple.

I told Lacoste to bring his guitar. Maybe he’d get inspired.

“I don’t know,” he said, “I’ve never played on acid before.”

We got there and everything was going according to plan. We set up the stereo system—I got this Bose multimedia system that will simply blow you away. Even out in the country you can hear it for miles. And that’s what we had: miles. The nearest neighbor wasn’t even in the same state.

We got everything set up. I brought my portable projection TV system where you can show it in 4K on the wall up to a hundred inches in diameter. I even brought my astronaut galaxy star projector. That’s the little spaceman-looking thingy that makes stars shine all over the ceiling. This was going to be a great trip.

So we got everything set up. EVERYTHING. I reiterate that because it is so important. The last thing you want to do when tripping on acid is have to follow instructions. It’s just not even possible.

As T-minus and counting was about to strike, Lacoste made a rambling speech about life and such. He kept it short, thank God. He was just as ready to get going as I.

We toasted our little blotter tabs, then we dropped the acid on our tongues. “À votre santé,’ said Lacoste. “To your health.”

Cheers to that. If last week was any indication, this was going to be a full-throttled trip all the way to the moon. It was too late to turn back now.

But one hour went by, and nothing. That’s, okay; sometimes it takes a little while.

Lacoste began playing his guitar and I got up and started moving around. Let the blood get flowing. Not sure if that really even helps.

Another hour went by and I can’t say one-hundred percent that I was getting concerned, but something definitely wasn’t right. After the third hour, I definitely knew something was wrong.

“Is this it?” said Lacoste. “Doesn’t really live up to the hype.”

Indeed.

At some point we had to admit, the whole thing was a bust. It was all my fault. That’s what happens when you don’t properly plan.

Poor Chemise. All he wanted was a little reset after getting tossed out on his keister. Sorry, old friend.

But we weren’t going down without a fight. We tore that whole place apart looking for anything: roaches in between the cushions of the couch, vodka underneath the kitchen sink. Nothing. Not a goddamn thing. Spiritual journey, my ass. What a scam. I even caught Lacoste eyeing down the freon in the A/C unit.

The whole goddamn thing was a bust. And that’s when it came to me: a bust. A beer bust. There was a bar and a liquor store back towards town. It might be a little ways, but maybe we could still salvage the weekend.

Like I said in the beginning, my last acid trip was a total disaster. We really shouldn’t be drinking anymore, either. I still have to explain the dent in the car and my black eye when I get home, not to mention the smell of booze everywhere. I’ll leave it at that.

California sober. Yay.

Leth spent the last twenty five years coasting through interstellar space at about half the speed of light. Departing from Eris station he carried fifteen thousand colonists in hibernation as well as a kilotonne of finished goods from the Outer Planet Alliance. Not too many people leave Earth or Luna/LEO for the colonies these days. It’s mostly people who are sick of living in tin cans around Ceres or folks tired of pumping ethane off Titan.

Now though, he was half a year from arriving and it was time to brake. Ponderously slow he flipped over until his stardrive was pointed towards his destination and fired, thrusting at a comfortable one gee. He could thrust higher, but why? He wasn’t in a hurry, and high gee put the cargo at risk.

Two weeks after he lit the drive, Leth saw one of the stars move. 

Two and a half weeks after, he tracked it on an intercept course. If he had a body at the time, Leth would have made a sour face.

Captain Caty Senadon woke up from hibernation fuzzy, things out of focus, her brain muddled. 

“Hey Cap,” Leth said cheerfully. A small drone brought a change of clothes and a cup of coffee over to her hibernation cabinet as she climbed out. Caty liked Leth fine enough. His accent was weird; he said he was originally Albertan, though she didn’t know what that meant. 

“Leth? What’s going on?” Caty said as she looked around, after picking up the coffee. She was alone in the ship. Normally waking happens when the braking is nearly finished, and most of the crew is awake. “Am I alone?”

“I’m hurt, Cap!” Leth said jovially. “You saying you’re alone and your friend and ship City of Lethbridge is right here with a hot cup of coffee and some comfy clothes!”

“Yeah yeah,” Caty said, but she did pull on the clothes. The little drone took off out of the hibernation suite and she followed. “You still haven’t told me why you woke me up early.”

“We’ve got pirates inbound.” Leth said. “They’re about two weeks away if they keep up the burn. They’re running hot and heavy too, boosting at a solid two and a half gee if it’s anything. It can’t be comfortable aboard right now.”

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” Caty swore. “Anything we can do?”

“Until they come up alongside? Not really. I’ve got most of my power budget used up running the stardrive, and they’re too far away for any missiles. We’re not a warship anyway, I only have 4 of them.”

“You would think that a starship would have energy weapons of some kind.” Caty sighed as she entered Command. Leth helpfully had turned on the lights and ran the HVAC for a bit while Caty woke up, so the room wasn’t freezing cold. She still shivered a bit as she sat down.

“Hah. That’s just something in the media feeds.” Leth said. “The power to run a laser that had any effectiveness out here would be wild. No such luck.”

Pirates. Caty thought. She had been told that piracy was a “minor” issue around Parvati and New Wellington, but she had been assured that it was “more than taken care of” and that it “won’t be a problem.” Of course, that was ten and a half light years away, and twenty five years ago. “Well, you woke me for a reason then, Leth. Options?”

“Option 1: Do nothing.”

Caty made a face. “That doesn’t sound like an option.”

“It absolutely is an option. They won’t destroy us, they don’t have the heat. Besides, it’s not in their best interest to do that. Tick off too many starjumpers and we stop coming.”

“What would happen?”

“They’d board, ransack the place, pilfer as many of our valuables as they could carry and boogie.” Leth said simply. “I’ve been through it before.”

“I don’t like it, but it’s less… bad than I thought.” Caty drained her cup of coffee as the little drone brought another. “What else?”

“Option 2: cut the drive. We’ll scoot past them and they won’t have enough Delta-V to catch up.”

“But then we’ll miss Parvati, won’t we?”

“If I turned the stardrive back on and thrusted at one gee sure. But you know I’m rated for four gee continuous.”

“Ugh.” Caty had undergone high gee training back at the academy. Two months aboard a spinning O’Neil cylinder at two gee continuous. It was unpleasant, and Leth was talking about doubling that. “I think I’d rather they board, Leth. Anything else?”

“Option 3: repel boarders.”

“Hah!” Caty snorted. “This isn’t a pirate media, we’re not going to go cutlass to cutlass with them with my brace of pistols.”

“I’m serious Cap. Come on down to the port side airlock B, I’ve got something to show you.”

It was the second closest airlock to Command, on the topmost level of Leth.

Everyone saw the five kilometer length of City of Lethbridge and assumed that everything was laid out the long way. Instead, since acceleration provided the gravity, it was laid out more like a skyscraper with a stardrive on the bottom. Hundreds of “floors” ran the length of Leth, with Command at the top. 

“Okay Leth, what’s up?”

“This is the airlock that they’ll probably use.” Leth began, “It’s towards the top and easy to jimmy open.”

“Not the cargo hatches?” Caty said, tilting her head slightly.

“Nah. Too big, too unwieldy, too much atmo to blow things around.” Leth said. “No, they’ll come in here and make their way down. But they won’t get far.”

“Why not?”

“Because of this.” 

Caty heard the whine of servos overhead. She looked up and blanched at the sight of a twin machine-gun turret swiveling around, seeking targets.

“Fucking hell, Leth! You’ve got internal armaments? Why?”

“Well, for things like this, Caty.”

“Things like this? There are other reasons?”

“There are. Do I need to spell them out?”

*Mutiny*. *He means mutiny,* Caty realized. The turrets could easily dispatch a mutinous crew. “Er, no Leth. I get it. Won’t the rounds damage stuff?”

“Frangible rounds! Good against, er, biological targets, and they’ll shatter harmlessly against my hull or deck plates.” Leth said proudly. “They were my idea.”

“*Your* idea?” Caty said.

“Sure. I designed it. I was one of the lead designers for the starjumpers.”

“You?”

“Don’t sound so surprised Cap, I wasn’t always a starship. We can enter human shaped bodies easily.” Leth said, sounding a little hurt.

“I’m sorry Leth, I didn’t mean to imply that you couldn’t design starships, I was just… surprised to hear it. Normally my experiences with AI are the folks who run stations and ships.”

“We’re everywhere Caty; you just may not have known it at the time. If we choose, we can pass as well as anyone.”

“Okay, so you designed your… self. Anything else about you I should know?”

“Nah. I’ve got to keep some secrets. Keeps things interesting. So, Captain, which option will it be?”

\*\*\*\*

The former in-system freighter *Chennai*, now pirate vessel, cut their drive back to one gee so as to match speed with the starjumper and held station a few dozen kilometers away. Just as Vejay said, the ship never turned off their stardrive. “See? Just like I said. We’ll come alongside, go in through the Command deck airlock, grab all we can carry and get gone. The whole crew is still in hibernation; the place will be empty.”

“I dunno, it seems too easy” Hir said eyeing the ship through the cameras. Even at a mild magnification the ship filled the entire view of the scope. “I can’t get over how big starjumpers are.” He said, shaking his head. “It’s like a whole ass city flying through space.”

“A whole city filled with enough shit that we’ll never have to work again!” Vejay said and clapped him on the back. “I’ve done it plenty of times before, it’ll be fine.”

*If he had done it plenty of times before why did he need to do it again?* Hir wondered, but kept his mouth shut. 

The next morning they drifted over to the ship, and with a clang of metal, forced a connection. Hir, Vejay and the others stood in front of the closed airlock of the starjumper. Hir noticed that “City of Lethbridge” was stenciled along the top. “Okay, Vejay, how do we get in?” Hir said, and gestured with his head at the door.

“Ahmed has that taken care of.”

Ahmed in his ever present greasy coveralls made his way to the front. He stuck a very DIY looking box against the keypad of the airlock, and pressed a large mechanical button. “It’ll take half an hour or so to work,” he said, but almost as soon as he finished speaking, it chirruped and a little light on it turned green. “Huh, it’s done already.” He said peering at the box. “That was quick.”

“Great!” Vejay said and racked a round into his pistol. “Let’s go then.”

“Wait.” Hir said, and gestured towards the little box. “Ahmed said it would take a half hour, but it was done in seconds? Doesn’t that seem suspicious to you?”

“Why would it be suspicious?” Vejay said. “It just means Ahmed was underselling his skills. Come on!”

“I don’t know…” Hir said, trailing off. “Why don’t I stay aboard, and keep things going for you and your return?”

“Pffft, no work, no share of the take.” Vejay scoffed. “But if you wanna stay aboard and get nothing, that’s just more for us.”

Vejay, Ahmed and the others - minus Hir - stepped aboard the starjumper, and were immediately struck by how nice it was. The hallways were large and brightly lit, with clean white paint and the deck plates were even carpeted. “Check this out!” Vejay said, running his hand along the clean walls. “If they can spend this kind of money on an interior, no way they’re going to miss a few hundred kilo of stuff!”

“Hey fellas.” A voice said over the PA in accented Northern Parvatian. “I can’t help but notice you’re trying to rob me.”

“Who are you?” Vejay said. “I thought the crew would be asleep still.”

“They are.” Leth said. “I’m City of Lethbridge, the ship. You’re in my body right now without permission and I’d like for you to leave. If you pack up and get out now, nothing will happen. You can disconnect, and burn home. Hell, if you stay connected I’ll let you hitch a ride with me and get some free Delta-V.”

“That’s an interesting offer, City of Lethbridge,” Vejay said, pronouncing the name with a singsong voice. “But how about this for a counter offer. We get to go to the hold, carry off whatever we want, for as long as we want, and in exchange we won’t place two kilo of plastic explosive in your hibernation vault, and your crew stays alive?” One of the people behind Vejay held up a canvas bag that looked like it could hold three or four kilo of explosives.

“I see.” Leth said, sighing. “Welp, I did it Cait’s way first, just like she asked. Now we do it my way.”

“What the fuck is ‘your way’?”

\*\*\*\*

“Hey there,” Leth said over the shipboard comm, startling Hir awake. “You doin alright?”

“Uh, yes?” Hir said, confused. “Who are you?”

“Oh yah, I’m City of Lethbridge, the starjumper.”

“Oh.”

“Yeah. So... you’re Captain now, **if** \- and this is important - you disconnect right now and head back to Parvati.”

Hir swallowed thickly. “I see. Is there any... items I should bring back?”

“Oh no no,” Leth said quickly. “Nothing you need to concern yourself with. Not much worth taking really. Just get goin. You okay piloting that little runabout yourself?”

“And If I wasn’t?” Hir couldn’t help himself, he just wanted to hear what the interstellar ship would say.

“Well then I’d send you over a few choice texts on astrogation and engine management and maybe a few crates of supplies if you thought you’d need it while you learn how to fly home. You good?”

“Can you send over the supplies anyway? We’ve been on roti and water for the last two weeks.”

“I’ll send you a few spice packs and a sack of rice. Good luck out there, and remember. Nobody attacks a starjumper *twice*. You get me?”

“I get you.” Hir said, all the color gone from his face.”

1r10mxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RATS/comments/1r10mxp/the_story_of_your_first_rats/,The story of your first rats?,"Hi guys, I recently stumbled upon some old pictures of my first ever rat (don't worry, we had 2 but only 1 was ""mine"") and I wanted to share her story. It's not particularly special, but sometimes I feel like I'm close to forgetting her, so I'd like to sort of immortalize her in a way here, in a space full of people who will appreciate her. I also figured it may be nice to give other people the chance to share photo's and/or stories of their first rats in the comments without judgement. I feel like a lot of people had rats in the past with which they made mistakes in care, that's obviously not something to encourage, but in my experience it can form a barrier to sharing the rats themselves. So please: feel free to share your story/photos of your first ratties, the ones who started the love for you.

I'll start:

[Left: Kaas \(Cheese\), right: Rozemarijn \(Rosemary\)](https://preview.redd.it/zmgf99deznig1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e945fc6966c174ce34fd55ba15e632e9e6e10e6)

In the first picture, you see Rozemarijn (Rosemary) and Kaas (Cheese) in 2012. They're 2 sisters. Kaas was my older sister's and she's cute and all, but Rozemarijn was mine and she was amazing.

It all starts about 20 years earlier, when my mom was in college and came across a feeder rat in a local petstore. For reasons that still remain unexplained, she took this albino boy home and named him Verney. This was before the widespread use of the internet and unfortunately proper care on rats was also not yet widely known information, so Verney's life doesn't live up to our current standards of rat care. Since he was a feeder, I hardly think the petstore would've given much information either, but my mom did the best with what she knew. Verney never got a cagemate, but he did accompany her basically everywhere. Riding on her shoulder, getting to come out on her shoulders for parties, he often got bits of her food and was appearently even known to get sips of her beers at parties. Far from good husbandry, but he was a very well-loved rat who was saved from being snakefood to live to a decent age, chilling with a human he was completely smitten with and snacking on delicious treats left and right. My mom would always gush about how social and smart he was and how he was a great pet. You can still see the love for Verney any time my mom talks about him or looks at rats in general, that same love was probably a major factor in her decision to (after a lot of asking and begging) relent in letting me and my older sister get rats when I was 8.

To my mom's credit, she did way better this time, making use of all the new information we now had access to. Actually getting the rats was kept as a surprise from me and my sister, we had to go somewhere by car (I think she told us it was for work?) only to pull up a while later at the house of a reputable rattery. That was the best surprise I had ever gotten. Unfortunately, the mom of our future ratties was late giving birth, so what should've been our first meeting turned into looking at all of these woman's rats and some other babies instead (funnily enough, my mom doesn't remember our babies weren't born yet, so I guess 8-year old me must've been quite disappointed/surprised by this). I remember the woman had a bit of a funny accent and the entire house *reeked* of rats, but still my little animal-loving heart was working overtime. On the way back home my sister and I made a list about all the possible names we could give our babies when they were born.

Soon after, the litter was born and a picture was put online. In that very first picture, I chose my baby. She was black and white (though I didn't yet know that at the time) hooded. I visited this site *constantly*. Whenever I had time on out computer I was refreshing those webpages looking for updates on our litter, and kindly enough there were loads! I knew my girl's pattern by heart, so I could pick her out in all of the pictures, even amongst her siblings with similar patterns. The rattery where she came from has since stopped, so unfortunately the pictures have been lost to me, but I did do an embarrassing amount of passionate 8-year-old journalling/documenting? So I do have this picture from when she was newly born, which I studied for hours to memorize her patterns (whilst I waited for more pictures of course):

As an example of my ramblings there's also this *very insightful* piece of literature:

[Translation: My rats. I want rats because you can pet them well. You can let them sit in your neck and you can teach them tricks and let them do other fun stuff. And they're so cute, look! This is how they're born: they look like little worms. At some point they get colors and patterns look. Do you see it? When you get the rats they're 6 weeks and they look a little like this: \(added punctuation for clarity lol, at 8 years old I did not use punctuation appearently\).](https://preview.redd.it/ga69twavynig1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=301eff647eea90be561bb3bd7d4f820e77ecdf46)

So when they were old enough, we got to take them home and those ratties were loved dearly. My Rozemarijn loved to sit in my neck, burrowing into my hair. My memories of her are limited, but I do recall her cuddling into my neck as well as petting her tail when it curled onto my chest. Funnily enough, petting my new rat's tail for the first time gave me visceral flashbacks to that. I've been told (though I myself only have a vague memory of it) by my father that Rozemarijn also knew tricks. I do recall teaching her to sit on the coffee table and jump onto my shoulder when given a visual command (which was curling my finger at her). I don't remember exactly how I did that, so I assume I did it in the same way I knew how to teach my dog tricks, which involved lots of waiting, rewarding and repetition. She must've been a clever girl to be able to pick up on training despite a probably less-than-ideal trainer. 

The picture I found of their cage is this one:

https://preview.redd.it/bqv8i56h0oig1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1aed09182b811d03e13fcdce5650d5c8c70c724

featuring my childhood dog and his best friend. The cage was moved to a separate room a bit later to prevent my dog from stressing them out. The cage was big enough and I do recall purposefully thinking about the lay out with my mom and sister as well as getting rid of unsafe things we had gotten with the cage (I remember a slinky-like tunnel we got rid off after researching and learning they could get their feet caught in it), but looking at it now I can't help but find it bare. No wood to chew, now clutter to manoeuvre through, my boys now wouldn't last 3 hours in this cage without going crazy. Those tubes were also a whole thing, I don't remember cleaning poop or anything that much, that wasn't that big of a deal, but I do very vividly remember standing in the backyard, elbow deep into those tubes smelling of pee to clean them out. 

I gotta say a big thanks to my mom for actually looking out for our girls. My mom had learned at the end of earning Verney that she was pretty allergic to ratpee and that it'd make her wheezy. She let us get rats anyway, but she also stepped in to clean the cage and interact with the girls if we let our chores slip. Even though it must've brought her serious discomfort, she never let those ratties suffer the consequences of our actions. At one point in life, Kaas lost the tip of her tail (as I now know probably degloved), though we never learned exactly how she lost it. Kaas at some point started losing weight rapidly and I believe she died at home, though I don't really remember much of it. Rozemarijn on the other hand developed a tumor soon after in her stomach-area, which caused her to look like she was gaining loads and loads of weight. I vaguely remember telling my mom she was getting fat and my mom explaining that it was actually a tumor. That was pretty scary and confusing as a kid, having this visibly growing threat of death in your pet. I was mostly very thankful that the tumor didn't mean she had to die immediately, as I was still very much at the age where I just wanted my pets to live as long as possible and euthanasia for QoL was still out of reach for my developing brain (I remember being quite upset we had put my cat down when he had fluid in his lungs, because the last appointment before the euthanasia the vet had taken some of the fluid out to make sure he was comfortable whilst awaiting the appointment. I did *not* get why we should put him down if we could just let the vet keep taking the fluid out of his lungs. I think I understood drawing out pain was cruel, but general quality of life was just unfathomable to me). We let the tumor be for a while, enjoying her for as long as we could, though I believe we eventually did have her euthanized when her tumor was starting to impact her mobility. 

It took over 10 years before I deemed myself ready again to own rats, knowing I could give them enough attention and care. I ended up with my first two partly because they're grey and white, since I didn't want another black-hooded rat. Even over a decade later, I didn't want a ""replacement"" for Rozemarijn, instead opting for rats that looked completely different.

All in all, Rozemarijn, your life was not as full as it should've been. I wish I had been better at keeping up the cleaning and the attention. I wish I could've offered you the sort of life I try to give my rats now, but at the time I did the best I could and I hope you knew that. I hope I gave you a comfortable life, a life worth living for you and your sister. I hope despite everything, you knew you were loved. I chose you the moment I first laid my eyes on you and I think about you to this day.  ",3,1770729872.0,RATS,0,1.0,False

The car radio played:

 

*Bend down, baby, kiss the floor*

*Twerk it like a Hill Street whore*

*Bitch gon’ make me nut some more*

*Bitch gon’ make me nut some more*

 

Vic switched to silence. *Seriously?* he thought. *Mainstream hip-hop isn’t even trying anymore. Pretty soon they’ll just be grunting and burping over the beat: uh-huh, uh-huh-huh. As long as girls can dance to it, I doubt that anyone will even notice.*  

 

His thoughts twisted toward the day’s newspaper, now stashed beneath the passenger seat. He’d purchased it an hour prior, panicking in a convenience store parking lot, before finally mustering the courage to step inside the establishment. Living in his car, eating nothing but fast food while eschewing the comforts of running water, had left him grimy and reeking, just one small step above a vagrant. 

 

Waiting in the convenience store line, clutching a disgusting microwaved breakfast sandwich and a Powerade, he’d noticed two girls staring from the wine racks. One looked familiar—pretty but not overtly so—a face half-remembered from high school hallways. 

 

Unsure whether he was a fugitive or not, Vic felt horribly exposed in their proximity. Carefully putting his back to the ladies, he’d adopted a relaxed posture, and watched the ahead-of-him customers toss money to the cashier. Still, he’d caught the girls’ attention. 

 

“Hey, Megs, isn’t that the guy…you know, the weird one? Remember, that jerkoff who found his locker filled with used diapers during Spirit Week?”

 

Vic felt himself blushing, as shameful memories resurfaced. 

 

“Oh, yeah, I remember now. Didn’t the lacrosse team do that?”

 

“I think so. Man, what a freak.”

 

“Capital ‘L’ Loser, for sure. He *is* kind of cute, though. I wonder if he’s gay or just socially retarded.”

 

“I don’t know. Either way, he *definitely* still lives with his mother.”

 

The females cackled like octogenarian crones. Vic wanted to flee to the parking lot, but knew that bolting would only make the girls laugh harder. 

 

“I wonder if he knows that we’re talking about him,” Megs chortled. 

 

*No, bitch, I’m deaf*, he’d thought, wanting to scream it. Still, all things considered, at least they hadn’t mentioned a murder. If Vic was a suspect, it seemed that the media hadn’t reported it. 

 

At the register, he snatched up a newspaper, handed over a twenty, and waited for the cashier to count out change. Glancing back toward the wine racks, he’d seen the females staring, their eyes suffused with merriment. “Fuck ’em,” he’d muttered, exiting into open air.            

 

Subsequently studying the newspaper, Vic had read something that sent Powerade spraying from his face hole. Knut Jansson’s murderer *had* been caught, it reported. During a burglary gone wrong, Hutch Sampson, a local boxing instructor, stabbed-stabbed-stabbed and fled. He’d left some trace evidence behind—hair and unspecified fibers—and had no alibi for the time of murder. 

 

The arrest photo featured a scowling crew cut above a neck like a waterlogged tree trunk. *Who is this dude?* Vic had wondered. *Did the Silent Minority frame him? They wrote that they’d keep my secret, but never mentioned anything like this.* 

 

He’d peered closer. With the image mere centimeters from his scrutiny, in Sampson’s eyes, Vic had beheld rage and confusion consolidated, menace scarcely subdued. His lips were swollen and split. A bruise marked his right cheek, indicating that he’d resisted arrest. *Who is this dude?*

 

He turned onto Reginald Court. *Wow, what a depressing street*, Vic thought. Starving felines straggled through barren lots, their open sores leaking. Dirty-faced children rode bicycles over dirt bumps. Drug-bleared mothers populated picnic benches, scrutinizing their own infants as if they were extraterrestrials. There’d been a community there once, indicated by the many condemned houses and burnt-out storefronts. Now, only squatters and liquor stores remained. 

 

1414 was past the desolation, behind an open security gate, and consisted of a parking lot housing two-dozen vehicles, and an ugly prefabricated steel warehouse, painted sky blue. If the firmament that morning hadn’t been grey and cloud-plagued, the squat structure might have benefited from chameleon-like camouflage, and appeared less like an overturned cereal box.       

 

Vic parked. Somebody lurked at the warehouse’s rolled-up shutter door, and so Vic trudged over to greet him. Drawing closer, Vic realized that a surgical mask concealed the man’s mouth and nose. Closer still, and he saw that the mask had been painted: two monkey paws over the man’s mouth, homage to Iwazaru, the “speak no evil” ape. 

 

“Uh, hi there,” Vic said. “My name’s Victor Dickens. I was invited here.” 

 

Wordlessly, the man held up a copy of the *DAY OF THE INTROVERT* pamphlet, raising one eyebrow in silent inquiry. 

 

“You…want me to show you my pamphlet? Is that it?”

 

The man nodded. 

 

After a parking lot shuffle, Vic returned with his leaflet. The doorman waved him in.  

 

Vic encountered a table, its surface covered with surgical masks identical to the doorman’s. Beside it, a freestanding sign declared, *TAKE ONE. WEAR IT. YOUR DESIGNATED STATION IS:* There was a list of perhaps forty names, alphabetized. Finger-tracing his way down, Vic found his station: Number 24. 

 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous, Vic donned a mask. 

 

The warehouse’s initial purpose was a mystery. No goods or heavy machinery remained. Now, the building’s interior was filled with cubicles, stretching nearly from wall to wall. Blandly impersonal, each cubicle contained a desktop computer, desk, swivel chair and storage cabinet. Only the side partition numerals distinguished one from another.  

 

Searching out Number 24, Vic passed other occupied cubicles. Their occupants had their backs to him. Wearing headphones, they gawked at computer screens. Nobody spoke, but the silence wasn’t awkward or oppressive. In fact, the hush felt welcoming, like an open prairie at the end of time.  

 

Of the men and women he passed, a number were obese or shockingly thin. Some were albino-white; others emanated a fishy odor indicating Trimethylaminuria. A few seemed perfectly normal, attractive even, at least when glimpsed from behind. All wore surgical masks. 

 

Finally, Vic found his cubicle. Settling into a swivel chair, he turned his focus toward the computer monitor, which displayed a screen saver: a shifting chiaroscuro juxtaposing divine imagery with scenes of demonic torture. *This is just too damn weird*, Vic thought. Still, he jiggled the mouse to clear the screen, and donned the provided headphones. 

 

A prompt box requested identification, and so Vic typed his name, which started up a multimedia presentation.   

 

A flourish of trumpets sounded. Words slid across the screen: *GREETINGS, VICTOR DICKENS*. *WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT KNUT JANSSON’S “MURDERER” HAS BEEN APPREHENDED? YOU’RE WELCOME.* 

 

Hidden camera footage played, featuring a familiar figure inside a boxing gym’s locker room. Hutch Sampson, shirtless, smacked a skinny adolescent around, screaming, “Toughen up, pussy! Toughen up!”

 

*MEET HUTCH SAMPSON*, the text read, *BOXING INSTRUCTOR EXTRAORDINAIRE. FROM THE RING TO THE STREET, THIS PHILANTHROPIC FELLOW IS EVER-EAGER TO PROVIDE YOUNGSTERS WITH A HELPING HAND.*   

 

The scene switched to a back alley, presumably behind the gym. A boy surely no older than twelve, bespectacled, cried as Hutch forced him to eat a dead rodent. 

 

As the scene segued to showcase a battered woman shambling from her home to her car, Vic read, *MEET HUTCH’S GIRLFRIEND*. The woman’s face was contusion-covered, her eyes so swollen that she could scarcely navigate. Her zebra print leggings were bloodstained from the crotch down; her right shoulder hung out of socket. *IT APPEARS THAT SHE NEEDED SOME INSTRUCTION, TOO.* 

 

Hutch barreled into the screen, grabbed the dislocated appendage, and yanked the shrieking female back homeward. With disgusted fascination, Vic noticed that the man sported an erection. 

 

*Holy mackerel,* Vic thought. *And I actually felt bad for this dude.* 

 

*WE DON’T JUST MONITOR PROMISING INTROVERTS, BUT BULLIES AS WELL. IT’S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A FALL GUY, AFTER ALL, AND WE KEEP OUR EARS TO THE GROUND.* 

 

*HAVING MANY FRIENDS ON THE POLICE FORCE, HUTCH WAS PRACTICALLY IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION. THE COMPLAINTS OF HIS VICTIMS AND THEIR PARENTS WENT IGNORED, AND THE MAN CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE NEW STUDENTS. THE JOCKISH ONES WERE PROVIDED ORDINARY LESSONS, BUT THE INTROVERTS…BOY HOWDY! AS FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND, SHE WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO TALK. EVENTUALLY, THE SILENT MINORITY HAD TO STEP IN.* 

 

The screen permitted one final glimpse of Hutch Sampson, collapsing beneath a fusillade of Tasers and truncheons, his blood-painted face howling obscenities at the arresting officers.  

 

*ARE YOU RELIEVED, VICTOR? WELL, DON’T GET TOO COMFORTABLE. YOU STILL HAVE NEIGHBORS, AFTER ALL, AND THEY HATE YOU TREMENDOUSLY. YOUR DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER APPROACH WAS TOO RUDIMENTARY, BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF THEIR MALEVOLENCE. ERGO, WE WENT AHEAD AND BUGGED THEIR HOMES. IT’S NOT HARD TO DO, PROVIDED THAT YOU SHOW UP IN EXTERMINATOR GEAR, AND OFFER THEM A FREE TERMITE INSPECTION. HERE’S WHAT THEY SAID IN YOUR ABSENCE:*  

 

An audio compilation played, voices both familiar and strange. The first sounded like Knut’s brother: “I don’t care what the papers say! That little faggot had something to do with it! I swear to God, I’m gonna set up a noose in Vic’s garage, make it look like he hung himself!”

 

It cut to a conversation between two Hispanic-accented speakers. At first, Vic couldn’t recall any Hispanic neighbors. Then he remembered the two men who resided four houses down from him, who motored to parts unknown inside a grey Toyota truck every morning. 

 

“Victor has no dick, eh?” one asked. “He afraid of pussy?”

 

“Virgin, I think,” the other replied. “Pretty boy, yeah?”

 

The first speaker laughed. “Maybe we cut off his arms and use him for sex slave. White boy only good for fuck puppet, anyway.”

 

“Where we gonna put him when we’re done, homes?”

 

“Deep sea fishing, heh-heh.”

 

Had Vic been drinking something, it would have gone spraying all over the computer screen at that moment. He was aghast, having never considered the sexual connotations of his past victimizations. Had all those meatheads and gossip guys been attracted to him all along, and unable to express it properly? Should he be flattered on some level?    

 

“Ugh,” he grunted, shaking his head to dispel ghastly man-on-man rape visualizations. Even that short exclamation felt blasphemous in his current surroundings, wherein noise only emanated from headphone speakers.  

 

Vic recognized the next voice as Bill’s, considerably more sober than it had been on the digital voice recorder: “We need to teach him a lesson.” 

 

*Well, he could be referring to anybody*, Vic reasoned. Then came, “We’ll take two cars, sandwich his Taurus in so he can’t escape.” 

 

*Yikes*, Vic thought. *Never mind. What did I ever do to you, Bill? In fact, how about I teach you a lesson, dickhead? I won’t use a pencil, but I’ll write it in lead. Damn, that sounded cool in my head, just like an action hero. I wish I’d said it out loud.* Contemplations shifting somber, he frowned. *How many of those fuckers am I gonna have to kill?* 

 

And still they came, varying in gender and age:

 

“That Dickens boy needs therapy.”

 

“I tell you, he likes little kids.”

 

“Let’s wait until he goes to work, drive over a U-Haul, and take everything that faggot Victor owns. Little queerbait probably doesn’t even have insurance.”

 

“We already know he’s unstable.”

 

“What’s he doing in his room, sitting in the dark for two nights in a row?” *I wasn’t even home, you asshole*, Vic might have countered. 

 

Then, most ominously, came five enigmatic words, half-whispered: “We’ll bring Vic the scissors.”

 

*Okay, this is just getting ridiculous*, he thought. *No way could the neighborhood be this obsessed with me. Is the Silent Minority faking this somehow? I didn’t even recognize half of those voices. Seriously, what have I stumbled into? Is this a cult? Am I in a cult right now? Am I being brainwashed?*

 

The text returned: *WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, BIG GUY? YOU’RE PROBABLY SUSPECTING THAT WE’RE MESSING WITH YOUR HEAD, THAT YOUR NEIGHBORS CAN’T POSSIBLY BE AS EVIL AS DEPICTED. LUCKILY, WE INSTALLED SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AROUND YOUR PROPERTY.*

 

*Do I even wanna see this?* Vic wondered, but it was already too late. The footage was playing; his fate was sealed. 

 

The first clip exhibited his house from a top-of-the-streetlight angle. A kid wearing a sideways visor, his tank top reading *ILL SON*, spray-painted a message across Vic’s front door: *DICKENS Z BUTT*. Though crudely immature, that one made Vic chuckle. 

 

The next angle came from Vic’s front lawn palm tree, evident from the fronds framing the clip. This one was no laughing matter. It featured one of his Hispanic neighbors reclining in Vic’s yard, staring up at Vic’s window. The man was in a centerfold pose—one leg thrown over the other, propped up on one elbow, gripping his back cranium. His mustache was thick and slimy, like black conjoined slug twins.  

 

*Christ, is this dude* *trying to seduce me?* Vic wondered, shuddering. The footage went time-lapse—cars speeding by, day turning to night—with the man locked in that position. Vic wanted to scream, felt himself shivering out of his own skin.

 

The clips continued. In quick succession, he watched a woman he didn’t recognize instruct her Shih Tzu to defecate upon his lawn, Knut’s brother angrily pounding his door—most likely seeking confrontation—and a middle schooler neighbor snatch a package off of his doormat. *Aw, man. Those were the John Carpenter Blu-rays I ordered. I wonder if Amazon will send replacements.* 

 

Mercifully, the clips ended. *I know what I’ll do,* Vic thought, *I’ll give this presentation to the cops. They’ll have to do something, won’t they?* Then he remembered a complaining comic shop customer, who’d recently had his iPhone stolen. Using the Find My iPhone feature, he’d tracked the device to the thief’s house, only to have the cops inform him that they couldn’t do anything about it. “They were too busy shootin’ black jaywalkers,” Mr. Man Tits had declared, storming out with a bag of vintage manga.   

 

Now the text read: *CHECK THE STORAGE CABINET, VICTOR. WE CAN’T LET YOU LEAVE WITHOUT A COUPLE OF PARTING GIFTS.* 

 

Inside of the cabinet, Vic discovered a firearm—a Ruger SP101 double-action revolver—nestled within two-dozen boxes of .357 Magnum rounds. Lifting the gun, he found that it had a reassuring heft to it. 

 

He tucked it into his waistband, and pulled it back out just as quick. *Christ, I forgot to check if the thing is loaded. I could have blown my own nuts off.* Checking the five-round chamber, as he’d seen done in countless action flicks, he saw that it was filled.     

 

In the next drawer down, there was an empty black Samsonite duffle bag. *Ah, what the hell?* Vic thought, tossing the Ruger and its rounds into it. Beneath the bullets, he discovered a key and a magnetic key card. 

 

Now the computer screen read: *YOUR HOUSE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, VICTOR. WHY DON’T YOU COME STAY WITH US? SHOULD YOU ACCEPT IT, THAT KEY BELONGS TO YOUR OWN PRIVATE APARTMENT, WITHIN A COMPLEX EXCLUSIVE TO THE SILENT MINORITY. THE KEY CARD WILL GET YOU INTO THE PARKING LOT. YOUR APARTMENT NUMBER IS 24, AS IS YOUR PARKING SPACE. GOODBYE, VICTOR. TRY NOT TO DISTURB ANYONE ON THE WAY OUT. WE’LL BE IN TOUCH.* 

 

Shrugging, Vic pocketed the card and key. *I could check the place out, I guess,* he reasoned. *It’s not like I have to live there.* 

 

Before leaving, he compressed the presentation, and emailed it to his Gmail account. *A little reassurance*, he thought. *I’ll send this file to Last Words, Inc. later, just like that first recording, so that it reaches the news, the cops, and my parents if I die. The neighbors might manage to kill me, but even the police won’t be able to ignore evidence in a murder case. If I’m going down, I’m taking those assholes with me. Yeah, fuck ’em.* 



 

**Chapter 5**

 

His destination was printed on the keycard. Vic fished his cellphone from his glove box, replaced its battery, and punched the address into his route planning app. 

 

His bladder throbbed. *I should have checked that place for a bathroom,* he realized. The route planner estimated a seventeen-minute drive. *At least the apartment complex isn’t far.*

 

Passing through a seedy neighborhood, he saw hookers and street toughs staring slack-jawed from stoops. One prostitute caught his eye. Her arms were bruised and track-marked, her hair missing sizable clumps. Her face appeared to have been sandblasted, and then slapped with a pepperoni pizza. 

 

Briefly, Vic visualized the past, to glimpse the teenage beauty queen lurking beneath time’s ravages. *Once, she was the sort of chick that guys would tear their hearts out for, just to toss at her feet. Or maybe they’d just write terrible poetry, to leave in envelopes ’neath her doormat.*

 

*Why must people destroy everything beautiful?* he wondered. Glancing at the passenger seat duffle bag, he fought the urge to withdraw the Ruger and start blasting away. 

 

When four stoop-dwellers began stumbling toward him, their faces amphetamine-warped, Vic realized that he’d been coasting at too leisurely a pace. Mashing the accelerator, he heard shouted threats fading and glass bottles shattering.    

 

Finally, he found the address, situated between a smoke shop and an adult school. If the complex had a name, there was no sign to proclaim it. Utilizing the keycard, Vic claimed his private lot parking space, and emerged bent on exploration. 

 

Instead of heading directly for the stairwell, he decided to survey the grounds. The complex comprised six low-rise buildings, with a well-kept courtyard at their epicenter. 

 

The courtyard was a site most majestic, featuring masonry arches, bubbling fountains, and a goldfish pond. Its garden was extensive, including prime specimens of Silverbush, star magnolia, and French lavender. Apartments encircled the courtyard entirely. Each building had its own entrance. 

 

With the place being so tranquil, Vic was shocked to find it empty. *Where are all the other introverts?* he wondered. *Is the complex new? Or are they in hiding, terrified by the possibility of social interaction?* There had been other vehicles in the parking garage, but perhaps they’d been abandoned.

 

*Fuck it*, he thought. *Time to check out my apartment. My apartment. Christ, have I already decided to live here, and just now figured it out? Slow down, buddy.*

 

Consulting a freestanding floor plan display, Vic located his place. It was fully furnished: leather couches, king-sized bed, oven, microwave, vertical blinds, etc. 

 

“Holy shit, is that a 4K TV?” It was, all seventy inches of it. 

 

Had somebody on the street uttered the word “apartment” to Vic, he would have pictured something eerily similar to his current surroundings. Carpeted floors, ceiling fan, mirrored closet doors, and an air conditioner—yeah, Vic could see himself living there. The only thing missing was a phone. There wasn’t even a jack present. 

 

He sat on the couch. *Damn, that’s comfortable.* He flicked the TV on. *Free HBO…nice. And they’re just giving this place to me? That can’t be right.* 

 

*There has to be something they’re not telling me,* he thought. *I need to leave right now, and head back to my real home before I wake up with my kidney stolen. Get up, Vic. Get outta here, ya stupid bastard.* He didn’t move. Having spent too many frantic hours living out of his car like a fugitive, it was difficult to abandon fresh comfort. *Well, I guess that I can stay a little longer. I’ll go home tomorrow morning, and think things over.* 

 

He found the refrigerator fully stocked: Eggo waffles, sandwich makings, milk, orange juice and steaks—it was incredible. And beer, plenty of beer. 

 

“Hey, now we’re talkin’.”

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Twenty-four hours later, he still hadn’t left. Instead, he studied his *DAY OF THE INTROVERT* pamphlet, reading it over and over, seeking the meaning behind the words. 

 

The more that he read it, the more suspicious Vic became. Sure, the underlying argument still connected, but there was something about the writing style that set him on edge. With the short paragraphs—a space between each one—and the catchy all-caps subheadings, it read as if a copywriter had written it, as if cynicism suffused the text. Or maybe Vic was just paranoid, as anyone would be in such bizarre circumstances. 

 

He hadn’t been contacted by the Silent Minority, hadn’t glimpsed or overheard a single neighbor. It was nice, but he was growing bored. He needed his computer, his books, and his videogames. *Maybe I’ll get them tomorrow.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

A week later, Vic finally encountered his first Silent Minority neighbor. She was anemic, sloop-shouldered and acne-ridden, and lived across the hall. One morning, he spotted her lugging an overstuffed trash bag down the stairs, her awkward grasp permitting it to split. 

 

“Here, let me help you with that,” he said, as its contents began spilling. She offered no reply, but allowed him to place supportive palms beneath her burden. Together, they tossed it into the parking garage dumpster, but not before Vic noticed something curious. 

 

“Hey, was that an entire turkey in there?” 

 

She nodded. 

 

“And biscuits, peas, corn and stuffing, all uneaten?”

 

She nodded again.

 

“You just threw away a Thanksgiving dinner?”

 

Yeah, you guessed it: another nod. 

 

“Why?” 

 

She shrugged, and then sprinted away, disappearing up the staircase like a fireworks-spooked feline. Salivating, Vic looked to the dumpster. *Maybe a cat peed on it,* he rationalized. *I mean, there’s got to be something up with that food. Nobody would just garbage-chuck a feast, would they?*  

 

He began revisiting the dumpster, day after day, flashlight-shining to seek out fresh refuse. Two days later, he saw three thick-cut, pan-fried steaks, plus asparagus and fully loaded baked potatoes, all intact. Three days after that, he saw Cajun-style shrimp and catfish, plus rice and red beans—restaurant quality. 

 

After a lifetime of withering under the public eye, Vic understood the sacredness of privacy. But now, for the first time ever, he caught a dose of that fascination so long turned against him: the itch to comprehend an inexplicable individual. Crouching behind the dumpster for thirty-seven hours straight, sustained on coffee and granola bars, he realized that he was nearly as bad as his persecutors. The sole difference: he didn’t wish to harm his introvert. 

 

*Why don’t I just knock on her door?* he wondered. *No, I don’t want to put her guard up. This needs to seem like a chance meeting, not some kind of home invasion.*

 

His eyes closed, only to pop back open as a trash bag thumped heavily. He sprang to his feet, and leapt into the girl’s vision space. She opened her mouth and jumped back, but voiced no scream. Her eyes were large and round above fear-widened nostrils. 

 

“No, don’t be afraid,” he said. “I accidentally tossed my bag over the bin.” 

 

*Yeah, she’s not buying it.* 

 

He peered at her discards—spaghetti and meatballs, thick slabs of garlic bread. Looking away from the repast, he saw the girl retreating. 

 

“Hey, wait up a second!” he called, hurrying after her. “Oof, you’re like greased lightning. C’mon, I just wanna talk.”

 

As she fumbled with her apartment key, he caught up to her. *Leave her alone, Vic*, he scolded himself. *You’re just one erection away from being a rapist right now.* But he’d already gone too far. He’d be getting his answers, or at least a home cooked meal. 

 

Grabbing her shoulder, he twirled the girl toward him. “Seriously, don’t be like that. It’s just…I don’t get it. Why do you keep throwin’ away all these incredible meals? Do you ever take a bite? I mean, what do you eat, if you’re always garbage-tossin’ your meals?”

 

Her mouth dropped in slack-jawed indignation. *Oh, I’m in for it now*, he thought. *This girl’s gonna give me a piece of her mind.* Instead, she just gaped. *Hey, why isn’t she saying anything? Why’s her mouth look so funny? Oh, she doesn’t have a tongue.* 

 

Vic grew contrite. “Hey, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to assault you. I guess you think that I’m some kind of maniac.”

 

She nodded. 

 

“Yeah, I don’t blame you. But if there’s nothing wrong with the food, maybe you could share some with me. I mean, it’s gotta be better than just tossing it all, and I can’t cook for shit.”  

 

Instead of nodding or giving a thumbs-down, the girl turned away. This time, when she twisted her doorknob, Vic let her. *Does she even speak English?* he wondered. *Maybe those trash meals were just practice, and she only eats human flesh. Man, I hope that I don’t wake up inside a giant basting pan one morning, with her standing there naked, brushing butter onto me. Actually, that sounds kind of hot. If she didn’t cook me afterward, it could be an interesting bit of kink.* 

 

Shaking his head to clear away erotic imagery, Vic returned to his own place. *Do I have anything left to eat?* he wondered. *I know I finished off that last steak, but maybe there’s some lunchmeat left.* 

 

His worries were unnecessary. While he’d been out, some unknown benefactor had restocked Vic’s fridge. There was even cake this time. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Two days later, Vic sat watching daytime television, bored out of his skull. He’d yet to return to his real house, mostly out of fear of his neighbors. He had, however, called Mr. Ogden—claiming illness, begging to keep his job. His employer hemmed and hawed, before telling Vic to be there on Monday, come Hell or necrotizing fasciitis.

 

Without his computer, masturbation had become perfunctory, a fantasy-free chore no different from defecation. Without his Blu-rays, he was limited to whatever crap the cable companies offered, and thus rewatched Michael Bay movies he’d hated on the first viewing.   

 

At the Silent Minority complex, everything was free: housing, food, electricity, water, and cable television. But they never gave him any money, presumably to limit his contact with the outside world. *Classic cult tactics,* he thought. *Leave me penniless, so that the Silent Minority becomes my entire universe. They want me completely dependent on them, but I’m not falling for that shit. Sure, I’ll stay in this free apartment, but the second that they pull some Manson family bullshit, I’m out of here.* 

 

*At any rate, it’s time I got back to the neighborhood. Isolation is one thing, but separation from one’s stuff is like prison. I’ll bring the revolver this time, in case one of those assholes fucks with me. Let them try to change my name to Victim; I’ll shoot their fuckin’ brains out.* 

 

There was a knock at the door. Vic found the hallway empty, but something had been left on his doorstep: a serving tray, its contents hidden beneath silver cloches. Vic took the tray inside. Beneath the domes he found breakfast. 

 

One bowl contained corned beef hash, topped by a fried egg. Upon a plate, there were pancakes, drowning in butter and syrup. There was bacon and buttered toast, silverware and a napkin. The scent was irresistible. 

 

*That girl,* he thought, smiling. *If she keeps this up, I’ll be morbidly obese in no time.* 

 

Vic ate until his stomach hurt, stored the leftovers in his fridge, and washed the dishes and flatware. When they were sparkling clean, he left everything on his neighbor’s doorstep. On one of the cloches, he affixed a Post-it message: *THANKS FOR THE FOOD. IT WAS DELICIOUS. IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, PLEASE DON’T HESITATE TO ASK.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Having finally returned to Turquoise Street, Vic inspected fresh front door graffiti. *DICKENS Z BUTT* had been joined by four swastikas, and the phrases *DIE JEW!* and *BITCH BOY*.    

 

*They’ve decided I’m Jewish now?* Vic wondered, followed by, *People are still prejudiced against them?* 

 

The purloined Amazon package had returned to his doorstep, now open. Within it, he glimpsed his John Carpenter Blu-rays—*The Thing, In the Mouth of Madness,* and *Prince of Darkness*—out of their cases, upside down, and knife-scratched so that they’d never play. Something had been left atop them. 

 

*Jeez, is that animal or human?* Vic considered. *Man, Amazon will never take those back now.* 

 

Abhorrence twisting his features, Knut’s brother glared from the Jansson driveway. He was loading up a U-Haul. Their lawn displayed a *FOR SALE* sign.

 

*Yeah, fuck you*, Vic mouthed, squinting at the flush-faced Swede. The man looked ready to throw down his boxed-up dishware and grab the nearest hacksaw, but Vic wasn’t worried. He had the Ruger in his pocket, and extra rounds in his car.   

 

Leaving the package on his doorstep, he went inside. The musty interior made him sneeze. But that was okay. He didn’t plan to stay long. 

 

He pulled the Ruger from his pocket, pointed it toward the Jansson house, and pantomimed squeezing the trigger. The gun seemed to possess its own negative karma, bad vibes demanding senseless slaughter. Vic wondered if it had killed before, if ghosts whispered in its barrel at night. He repocketed the firearm. 

 

A cry came from his backyard, a sorority girl’s “Whooooooo!” But it was no college temptress that met Vic’s parted-blinds view, but a middle-aged woman, topless, shaking her withered teats left to right, right to left. Four men cheered her on—one with a needle in his arm, a belt tied above it—as another scag hag vomited in the bushes. There were whiskey bottles and empty baggies. A boombox blasted country music. 

 

Vic didn’t recognize any of them. *Christ, what the hell is going on here?* he wondered. *Are they squatting? It doesn’t look like they’ve been inside.* 

 

He moved his Taurus inside the garage. He didn’t want his neighbors to see him packing, to know that they’d driven him out. *Let them think that I’m here all day, watching them, plotting. Serves those assholes right.* 

 

He boxed up his computer, Blu-rays, books and comics. The collection was so comprehensive that it filled his car entirely, leaving barely enough space to climb behind the wheel. 

 

Before leaving, Vic called 911. “Yeah, I’ve got some trespassers in my backyard. The address is 1412 Turquoise Street. I think they’re doing heroin.” He hung up, hoping that that the investigating officers proved trigger-happy. 

 

Leaving the neighborhood, he encountered Knut’s brother. Standing mid-street, the man gripped a baseball bat, which dripped milk onto the asphalt, indicating that he’d battered a couple of cartons to psyche himself up. 

 

Vic pulled aside him, his window down, the gun pointing. “What’s up, fucko?” he asked. “Did your *Dream for a Day*become a nightmare?”

 

Understanding dawned. “You…I knew it,” the man sputtered.

 

“Yeah, I smote that demon. Good luck trying to prove it.” 

 

The man’s goatee seemed to grey. Throwing himself forward, he drew the bat back for a swing. But Vic was already in motion, speeding from the accursed neighborhood. Shouted threats faded in the distance, as he began to laugh. ",2,1770729844.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

1r10l8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1r10l8l/how_to_be_the_best_husband_the_sciencebased/,How to Be the BEST Husband: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"Real talk: most relationship advice is garbage. Everyone's out here saying ""communicate better"" and ""show appreciation"" like it's groundbreaking stuff. Cool. But nobody's telling you the actual framework that makes marriages thrive long-term.

I've spent the past year deep diving into relationship psychology (books, research papers, podcasts, therapist interviews) because I was genuinely curious why some marriages stay electric for decades while others feel dead after 3 years. What I found completely shifted my perspective.

Here's what the research actually shows:

**Master the art of repair, not perfection**

Dr. John Gottman's 40+ years of research at the Love Lab found something wild. The couples who stay together aren't the ones who never fight. They're the ones who recover quickly after conflict. His studies can predict divorce with 94% accuracy just by watching how couples argue.

The key? Repair attempts. Small gestures during conflict that prevent escalation. A joke. Touching their arm. Saying ""you're right about that part."" Most husbands try to WIN arguments. The best ones try to REPAIR the connection.

*The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work* by Gottman breaks this down beautifully. This guy studied over 3,000 couples in his lab with actual physiological monitoring. Not theory. Hard data. The book gives you specific exercises for building what he calls ""love maps"" (deep knowledge of your partner's inner world) and creating shared meaning. Seriously one of the best relationship books ever written.

**Understand her stress response isn't weakness**

Most dudes don't realize this: women's cortisol levels stay elevated 40% longer than men's after stressful events (UCLA research). Her brain is literally wired differently for threat detection and emotional processing.

When she comes home stressed and needs to vent? She's not asking you to fix it. She's regulating her nervous system through connection. Your job isn't to solve. It's to witness and validate.

Try this: ""That sounds really frustrating"" instead of ""here's what you should do."" Game changer.

**Hold space for her becoming, not just her being**

Here's something nobody talks about: people change. Your wife at 35 isn't the same person you married at 25. Her dreams shift. Her identity evolves. Many marriages die because husbands fall in love with a version of their wife that no longer exists.

Esther Perel talks about this brilliantly in *Mating in Captivity*. She's a world renowned psychotherapist who's spent decades studying desire in long term relationships. The book explores the tension between security and passion, and how to maintain both. Her insight about needing to see your partner with ""fresh eyes"" hit different. This is the best book on keeping attraction alive in marriage, hands down.

One practical move: ask her every few months ""what are you excited about right now?"" or ""what's something you want to explore?"" You'd be shocked how many husbands have no idea what their wives are currently passionate about.

**Learn her specific attachment style**

Not all women need the same things. Attachment theory explains SO much about relationship dynamics. There are basically three styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant.

If she's anxiously attached, she needs consistent reassurance and physical proximity during stress. If she's avoidant, she needs space to process independently before reconnecting. Secure folks are flexible.

*Attached* by Amir Levine breaks this down with actual neuroscience. It's based on decades of psychological research showing how our early childhood experiences shape our adult relationships. The book includes practical assessments to identify your styles and specific strategies for each combination. Insanely good read that explains why you keep having the SAME fights on repeat.

**Build rituals of connection**

The Gottman Institute found that couples who maintain small daily rituals have significantly higher relationship satisfaction. Not big gestures. Small consistent ones.

A 6 second kiss when you get home. Coffee together before phones come out. Wednesday night walks. These micro moments compound over time into deep emotional security.

The app **Paired** is actually clutch for this. It sends you daily questions to discuss with your partner (backed by relationship research) and tracks your connection patterns. Way better than generic couple apps. Helps you build the habit of intentional connection without it feeling forced.

If you want something that pulls together all these relationship insights into a structured plan, **BeFreed** is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni that turns relationship books, expert interviews, and research into custom audio content. You can literally type in ""become a better husband for an anxiously-attached wife"" or whatever your specific situation is, and it'll create a learning plan from sources like Gottman, Perel, and other relationship experts. You control the depth (quick 10-min summaries or 40-min deep dives) and can even pick a voice that doesn't put you to sleep. The virtual coach Freedia helps you actually apply this stuff instead of just consuming it. Makes it way easier to fit relationship learning into your commute or gym time.

**Prioritize her pleasure specifically**

Real talk: 95% of men orgasm during partnered sex. Only 65% of women do (research from Archives of Sexual Behavior). That gap? That's on us.

Most husbands think they're good in bed because their wife doesn't complain. But many women fake it to protect male egos or just end things faster. The best husbands get genuinely curious about their wife's specific pleasure map, which changes over time btw.

Emily Nagoski's *Come As You Are* should be required reading. She has a PhD in Health Behavior and this book breaks down the science of female sexuality (arousal, desire, anatomy) in ways that actually make sense. It'll completely change how you understand your wife's experience. Every husband needs to read this.

**Manage your own emotional landscape**

Here's the uncomfortable truth: most men outsource their emotional regulation to their wives. She becomes your therapist, your emotional processor, your sole source of validation. That's exhausting for her and unhealthy for you.

The best husbands have their own tools. Therapy. Male friendships with actual depth. Physical outlets. Mindfulness practices.

**Insight Timer** is great for this. Free meditation app with thousands of guided sessions specifically for men, stress management, and emotional regulation. Way less woo woo than you'd think.

**The Bottom Line**

Being the best husband isn't about grand gestures or checking boxes. It's about showing up consistently with curiosity, humility, and genuine investment in her wellbeing and growth. It's about doing your own emotional work so you can meet her as a partner, not a project.

Theologically, it’s fairly liberal by Christian standards, which I’m also comfortable with. That said, there are a few issues that have been bothering us — my wife first, but I’ve arrived at the same concerns.

# 1. Teaching and worship feel disconnected from Scripture

Lately, the sermons are based almost entirely on Christian self-help books rather than the Bible itself. At the last service I attended, the only biblical reference was a brief mention of Solomon as an illustration. It’s starting to feel more like a motivational or self-help group than a church grounded in Scripture.

Prayer is also minimal. Aside from the Lord’s Prayer during communion (which happens once a month), there is essentially no prayer during services. The explanation given is that prayer might make visitors uncomfortable — but after almost two years, my wife and I are still considered “new.” We do get visitors, but no one seems to stay long-term.

The church is literally on my block, so the location is extremely convenient. There are no other churches within walking distance, which makes this harder.

# 2. Leadership feels closed and cliquish

This has been especially difficult for my wife. The women’s leadership is part of a closed small group that she hasn’t been able to join because we’re “new.” She struggles with depression, and the secrecy around this group has made that worse. There have been multiple instances where conversations abruptly stop once they realize she’s nearby, which is painful and isolating.

From my side, I’ve tried to become more involved beyond basic volunteering. I did coffee and greeting for about a year and a half, then stepped down at the end of last year. I specifically asked to serve on committees or in more meaningful roles, but I’ve never been included.

Our average attendance is around 35–40 adults, so this isn’t a large church where things might naturally move slowly.

# 3. Political content vs. Christian formation

I wouldn’t be welcome in a fundamentalist church due to my beliefs, but I’m finding that liberal churches often lean too far into political topics for me — not parties, but issues. For example, we had an entire sermon focused on racial statistics. The conclusion was that Christians should care, which I agree with — but it didn’t feel like a sermon rooted in Christian teaching or Scripture.

I don’t attend church primarily to study the Bible — I can and do that on my own. I go for Christian community. And right now, that’s the part that feels most absent.

# Where we’re at now

My wife would like to try another church. I’m honestly feeling close to giving up on church altogether.

I *am* part of a couple small groups, but my wife is not. I’ve been wondering:

* Is it appropriate to step away from Sunday services but continue attending small groups?
* Has anyone else navigated staying connected to a church community while disengaging from the main service?
* How do you discern when it’s time to leave versus when to stay and endure?

I don’t really have anyone at this church I’d call a friend yet, and I feel uncomfortable bringing these concerns to people who seem genuinely happy there.

I’d really appreciate thoughtful, Christian perspectives on this — especially from those who’ve been through something similar.",1,1770729579.0,Christian,5,1.0,False

I’m 19. I work a zero hour contract at a zoo. Serving food, coffee and stuff like that. Best way to describe it is it’s similar to McDonald’s.

It was meant to be a job while I was at school, but I haven’t been able to find a new one since I left school in 2024.

Worked here for 3 years. Job causes me so much stress. I hate going in. I do not have a good relationship with my assistant manager. I feel like he treats me different because of my epilepsy. This is expected honestly, and I don’t blame him. I have been talked down to like a child by him for forgetting where things are because of my extreme brain fog due to my medication. He really only shouts at me, he’s nice to everyone else pretty much. I message him about how I’m sick and I cannot come in and he doesn’t even respond. I call in sick very rarely despite my condition. Once every few months. I have missed shifts less than 10 months since I started working here. 

Serving customers stresses me the fuck out. They are so rude sometimes and it’s so hard on my mental health to deal with.

Sometimes I have to work by myself in a coffee hut where I’m by myself for 7 or 8 hours. This isn’t safe due to my condition I shouldn’t be alone in case I have a seizure. This stresses me out so much. I’m doing it Saturday. I’m so fucking stressed about it. 

Everyone at the job has told me they think I’m dumb and have no common sense. This isn’t my fault. I can’t help the brain fog I get. I really really try. They all think it’s funny. I don’t.

I need the money. It’s not much, 10 pounds an hour, but I need it. I need it to help my parents financially. I fucking hate this job. I have been looking for a new one since June 2024 to no success. It causes me so much stress. I feel like a pussy tho honestly and like I’m just being dramatic.

# 🔥 Introduction

Losing weight after 35 feels like arguing with a teenager—exhausting, one-sided, and somehow your fault. You eat better, move more, and the scale laughs in your face.

That’s where [Ignite Drops](https://theworldhealth.org/ignite-drops-official) entered the picture, promising to awaken a sleepy protein called **BAM15**. Supposedly, this little molecule might help burn fat *without* frying your energy or muscles.

If you're curious, frustrated, or just love reading about weird supplements on the internet, this review spills the tea—with facts, experience, and maybe a raised eyebrow or two.

============

============

# 🔍 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Ignite Drops
* **Category**: Supplements ➝ Weight Loss Drops
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.5/5

# 💧 What Are Ignite Drops?

**Ignite Drops** is a **sublingual weight loss supplement**—just 10 drops under your tongue before breakfast. It’s marketed as a way to *naturally* jumpstart your metabolism.

Its selling point? Activating a mitochondrial protein called **BAM15**—claimed to be your body’s built-in fat incinerator. Less sci-fi than it sounds, promise.

The product claims to be one of the **best weight loss drops of 2025**, especially for adults over 35 whose metabolic fire has turned to flickers.

# ⚙️ How Do Ignite Drops Work?

The magic supposedly lies in **how BAM15 works for metabolism and fat burning**. This protein can prompt your cells to burn more energy, even at rest.

Basically, it acts like a quiet assistant who actually does the work, burning calories without messing with muscle mass—aka **weight loss without muscle loss**.

Expertly manufactured to be among the few **supplements that activate BAM15 for weight loss, if you're over 35** this could be a [more efficient method](https://theworldhealth.org/ignite-drops-official) than **thermogenic fat burners**.

You don't often see **BAM15 supplements for weight loss**. It’s because targeting a specific protein that other fat burners don’t even mention is a very precise operation.

If you're wondering **how to naturally activate BAM15 protein**, this might be your best bet right now—short of lab experiments or biohacking with a PhD.

# 🧪 Ingredients Breakdown

The **Ignite Drops ingredients list** includes herbal heavy-hitters: **African Mango**, **Panax Ginseng**, and **Astragalus Root**, among others.

These are known for boosting energy, helping digestion, and supporting weight management without harsh chemicals—making it a **safe supplement for weight loss**.

Many reviewers over the age of **40** call it the **best supplement for metabolism** they've tried, with a blend designed for older adults struggling with stubborn fat.

The lack of specific dosages may raise an eyebrow or two, but the ingredient selection ensures this **natural metabolism booster for adults** performs well.

# 🙋‍♀️ Personal Experience (from someone I trust)

This one’s from my cousin-in-law, **Diana**, a 42-year-old single mom who works from home as a virtual assistant.

Between juggling client deadlines and raising a teenager, she barely has time to finish a cup of coffee, let alone prep meals or hit the gym. She’s been trying to lose the same 10 pounds for three years—and was more than a little skeptical when I [mentioned Ignite Drops](https://theworldhealth.org/ignite-drops-official).

Here’s what she told me:

The one thing she didn’t love? The dropper.

Diana’s not one to sugarcoat anything. If she says it made a difference, I believe her. She doesn’t exactly hand out praise like Halloween candy.

I am a Sage Barista Express user for the last 4 year almost. Can't complain too much as we all start somewhere. The thing is dying...its not a matter of if but of when. And I'm in the lookout for something of an upgrade. Not a pro in any way, but i've come to understand quite a lot of things for coffee and enjoy thoroughly the whole ritual in the morning.

My wife and I drink 2-4 coffees a day in total. The two first are with milk and the evening ones are just espressos. Thing with the Barista Express is that i've opened and fixed it like 3 times now. I had to open the whole machine in order to tighten the grouphead screws, very tedious. Now, need to be ready for when it dies, to replace it. I would like something that is easily serviceable by me (most of the time at least) and in a logical budget range. Dual boiler is not strictly needed but would be preferable, ability to pre-infuse is also greatly appreciated. I've been eyeing these :

Profitec GO  
Lelit Elizabeth

Lelit Bianca  
Profitec Move

We're based in EU so the prices are kinda ok. I would also need a grinder. We really enjoy light-mid roasts most of the time. Now, this would be additional budget but for the grinder I would go around 400-700€.

Thing is, I know that at a certain price point you only get incremental value. Budget plays a role, and I can not justify a LM Micra for example or ECM Sync II.

Cheers all!

EDIT : Please shoot any different options you might want, don't limit to whats mentioned only. But keep the budget in mind!",1,1770729235.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I live faraway with my parents and I dont have a car. My parents can be abusive. So accepted it, and a few people showed up, sharing photos of my work in social media. I was pleased with this but honestly also exhausted from the work, and the show, and the extrutiatingly long bus rides. I live outside of Quito. I thought I would mesage this person this new year for a coffee, and start building my network, because I dont have many people to talk to and this is very sad for me everyday. But the beginning of the year was tough. My Dad did some ugly things and I had to repress my feelings as usual. So what did I do instead? I posted a rant online about my circumstances, not the abuse, but how I was in a bad situation. She blocked me from social media. Given that everything in Ecuador takes such a long time and I thought I was finally moving on, I feel so ashamed for posting that rant and what I said. It might take me another 10 years to get someone like that, with whom I might go get a coffee, like me again. My reputation is ruined. I look like a crazy person.

I’m Ben, a Londoner who moved over from the UK in April, working in Tech and been living in Williamsburg for a year. I’m looking for a roommate or two to find a 2–3 bed apartment in NYC or move in to an existing lease. 

Budget is up to $2,500/month, ideally a bit less, and I’m wanting to find somewhere either on the UES or UWS for a late April/May move in.

Outside of work, I’m a big football (no not NFL, real football) fan and currently playing on a few co-ed teams around the city. I’m also involved in choirs, love exploring NYC, and generally enjoy getting out and doing things.

At home, I’m clean, respectful, and easygoing. I’m equally happy having a chilled night in or heading out, and I value good communication and shared respect in a living space. I also occasionally like to host friends, but never anything too wild and would always check in advance, and would be encourage housemates to feel they could do the same. Ideally I’d live with people I can become friends with, but I also totally respect different routines and boundaries.

If this sounds like a good fit, I’d love to chat, Let’s go for a coffee and a walk and see how we get on!

i need to vent about an interaction that really caught me off guard.

a client asked me to reheat his coffee, which i agreed to do. before reheating it, i needed to briefly finish charting and clear some dishes. when i reheated the coffee, i chose the stovetop instead of the microwave because it’s quicker and avoids a mess if the coffee rises due to heat.

less than a minute later, the client asked me to come over. when i did, he stated that he and his wife were “going to die soon.” this was said abruptly and without context, which immediately made the interaction uncomfortable. he then added that since they would not be here much longer, if they needed something, i would need to get it for them.

i asked what he was referring to, and he clarified that he meant the coffee. i reassured him that it was already being reheated. he then questioned why i did not use the microwave. i explained my reasoning calmly and asked for a bit of patience while i completed the task.

at that point, he responded by saying that i also needed to be patient with them. this was frustrating, as i had been respectful, attentive, and patient throughout the interaction, while also providing the majority of care to his wife.

what upset me most is that the situation escalated unnecessarily. a simple question about the status of the coffee would have avoided the entire interaction. instead, the conversation became tense over something very minor.

i remain committed to caregiving and to treating my clients with respect. however, this interaction left me unsettled and needing to vent, as it crossed into an uncomfortable and unnecessary exchange.",1,1770728830.0,venting,1,1.0,False

In today’s fast-paced world, money flows through our lives in countless small ways — a coffee here, a subscription there, an unexpected bill somewhere else. Often, we don’t even realize how quickly these small amounts add up. This is why it’s essential to track personal expenses — a practice that gives you clear insight into where your money goes, how you’re spending it, and how to shape a healthier financial future.

[**Tracking your expenses**](https://tracmyfinance.com/) is more than just adding numbers in a spreadsheet. It’s about understanding patterns, creating intentional habits, building a reliable budget, and ultimately gaining peace of mind. Whether you’re saving for a big goal, planning for retirement, or simply trying to reduce stress around money, learning how to track personal expenses is one of the most empowering steps you can take.

In this article, we’ll explore practical steps, helpful tools, and compelling reasons why tracking your personal expenses matters — and how it can help you build better financial habits for life.

# Why You Should Track Personal Expenses

**1. Awareness Leads to Better Decisions**

The first and most important reason to track personal expenses is awareness. Without tracking, it’s easy to underestimate how much you’re spending — especially on discretionary items like dining, entertainment, or online shopping.

When you know exactly where your money goes each month, you can make smarter choices. You may notice patterns like:

* Overspending in certain categories
* Habitual purchases that drain your budget
* Opportunities to cut back and save

Tracking expenses shines a spotlight on your financial habits, helping you spend with intention rather than reaction.

**2. Helps Build Realistic Budgets**

A budget isn’t a restriction — it’s a plan. And plans work best when they are based on accurate data.

If you track personal expenses regularly, you’ll have the information you need to build a budget that fits your real life. Instead of guessing how much you spend on groceries or utilities, you’ll know. This makes your budget:

* More accurate
* Easier to follow
* More effective in helping you save

You can then assign amounts for essentials, savings goals, leisure spending, and more — all tailored to your actual financial patterns.

**3. Helps You Reach Your Financial Goals Faster**

Whether your goals are short-term (saving for a vacation) or long-term (buying a home), tracking personal expenses can accelerate your progress. When you see how much you spend and where you spend it, you can:

* Identify unnecessary expenses
* Reduce wasteful spending
* Redirect funds toward savings goals

Clear tracking helps you stay focused and motivated because you can see progress in real dollars — not just in vague hopes.

**4. Reduces Financial Stress and Anxiety**

Uncertainty about money often leads to stress. When you don’t know where your money went, it’s natural to feel anxious.

But when you track personal expenses, you take control of the narrative. You replace worry with understanding, confusion with clarity, and fear with confidence.

Knowing what you have, what you owe, and where your money is going each month brings peace of mind that’s hard to overstate.

# How to Track Personal Expenses — Step by Step

Tracking your expenses doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming. Here’s a simple step-by-step framework to help you begin:

**1. Gather Your Financial Data**

Start with:

* Bank statements
* Credit card records
* Cash receipts
* Bills and subscriptions

Collecting all this information gives you a full picture of your spending history.

**2. Categorize Your Spending**

Once you have your data, separate expenses into categories such as:

* Housing
* Utilities
* Transportation
* Groceries
* Dining Out
* Entertainment
* Savings
* Miscellaneous

This helps you see which areas take up the largest portion of your budget.

**3. Record Every Expense**

Make it a habit to record each expense — even small ones. Over time, these add up and become meaningful insights. You can track manually in a notebook or spreadsheet, or use digital tools that automatically capture transactions.

**4. Review Weekly and Monthly**

Set aside time each week or month to review your expenses. This helps you notice trends, spot outliers, and adjust your budget as needed.

**5. Adjust and Improve**

Tracking personal expenses isn’t a one-time task — it’s an ongoing process. Use the insights you gather to:

* Reduce unnecessary spending
* Increase savings
* Reallocate funds to reach financial goals
* Build habits that support long-term stability
* Tools and Apps to Help Track Personal Expenses

Tracking expenses manually can be effective, but technology makes the process easier, faster, and more accurate. Some popular tools and techniques include:

# Budget Apps and Expense Trackers

Apps designed for financial tracking can:

* Sync with your bank accounts
* Categorize transactions automatically
* Provide visual reports and graphs
* Help you track trends over time

These tools simplify the process and make it more accessible, especially for busy individuals.

# Spreadsheets

A spreadsheet — whether in Excel, Google Sheets, or another platform — gives you full control over how you categorize and analyse your finances. You can customise formulas, charts, and views to match your preferences.

# Pen and Paper

Some people prefer to track personal expenses the old-fashioned way — writing down every purchase in a dedicated notebook. While slower, this method can be highly powerful because the act of writing increases awareness and accountability.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Tracking Expenses

Even with the best intentions, it’s easy to stumble. Here are common pitfalls — and how to avoid them:

**1. Forgetting Small Purchases**

It’s easy to overlook small expenses like coffee, snacks, or impulse purchases. But these add up quickly.  
Solution: Record every purchase — no matter how small.

**2. Tracking Inconsistently**

If you only track occasionally, patterns become harder to identify.  
Solution: Set a specific schedule — daily or weekly — for tracking.

**3. Not Reviewing Regularly**

Recording expenses without reviewing them defeats the purpose. You must check trends to gain insight.  
Solution: Schedule weekly or monthly reviews in your calendar.

# Real Benefits of Tracking Personal Expenses

When you consistently track your personal expenses, you gain:

* Greater financial awareness
* More accurate budgeting
* Clearer progress toward goals
* Reduced stress and anxiety
* Improved financial confidence
* Long-term financial stability

Tracking isn’t about restriction — it’s about empowerment. It gives you the tools to make informed decisions and shape your financial future with intention.

# How Tracking Expenses Can Improve Your Life

Money doesn’t just affect your finances — it affects your life. How you spend today shapes tomorrow. When you learn to track personal expenses, you gain clarity that influences every part of your life:

* peace of mind
* better relationships with money
* stronger confidence in your financial decisions
* freedom to pursue dreams with purpose

In essence, tracking personal expenses gives you a foundation — a financial lens through which you can see, understand, and shape your life with intention.

# Conclusion — Your Financial Journey Starts with Awareness

Learning how to track personal expenses is one of the most empowering financial habits you can build. It brings clarity where there was confusion, control where there was uncertainty, and confidence where there was stress.

Financial freedom doesn’t come from earning more — it comes from understanding what you have, where it goes, and how best to use it.

* So begin today.
* Gather your expenses.
* Record them.
* Review them.
* Learn from them.

When you choose to track personal expenses, you choose insight over uncertainty — and that choice can transform your financial life forever.",1,1770728725.0,u_trac_my_finance_01,0,1.0,False

That feeling of ""someone might see me slacking"" is apparently the only thing my brain respects.

Got diagnosed a few months ago but honestly this has been wrecking me for years. I kept joining random Discord coworking rooms but they were kinda hit or miss, so I ended up just building something for myself.

It's called EarlyBird - you join a session with other people, set a timer, and it blocks your apps until you're done. Then you have to submit proof you actually did the thing. You can also drag your friends into sessions with you which helps a lot.

Basically forced accountability + body doubling. Can't disable it mid-session which is key because past me cannot be trusted.

The emotional tone was palpable—they’ve sacrificed social connections, hobbies, even a basic awareness of current events, all because every ounce of energy has been poured into building something they truly believe in. They feel isolated, guilty for not knowing “what’s going on in the outside world,” yet they can recite every detail of their industry. That level of single-minded dedication is awe-inspiring, but it also raises questions about balance and long-term sustainability.

Given that context, a few ideas might be helpful as they navigate this phase:
- Recognize that staying informed doesn’t require deep dives every day; a short, curated news briefing or trusted newsletter can keep you connected without derailing momentum.
- Schedule strategic breaks—think of them as part of your productivity system rather than a distraction. Ten minutes of a walk, a coffee, or a quick catch-up with a friend can recharge focus and reduce feelings of isolation.
- Keep a running list of personal values and goals beyond the business; when you revisit it, you can assess whether the current sacrifices are still aligned with the life you want to build.
- Periodically review the health of your support network. Even if “going out for drinks” feels like a risk, intentional, low-stakes interactions can remind you that you’re not in this alone.

It was just the three of us no adults. Nothing was planned, I just wanted to spend time with him because we rarely got to meet.

As soon as I arrived, my boyfriend started making sexual advances, which already made me uncomfortable. Then his best friend kept insisting I drink bottled cold coffee. I said no multiple times because I don't usually eat or drink at other people's houses. They kept pushing.

What felt odd was that neither of them drank it, even though my boyfriend loved cold coffee and was a total foodie. dude literally are a sandwich off the school playground and was always sneaking in snacks. dude used to steal my lunchbox. Earlier, during our friend-zone phase, this same guy used to joke things like: ""Put sleeping pills and viagra in her drink and she won't even notice."" I brushed it off back then as stupid dark humor. i was a dumb teen aswell so i didn't know much.

But in that moment, my intuition was screaming don't drink it. So I didn't.

Nothing happened that day, but years later, now that I understand consent, coercion, and safety better, this memory keeps replaying in my head.

I don't know if I was being set up to be drugged or if it was just teenage boys being sexually pushy and creepy but I know the situation felt unsafe, and my gut reaction was intense.

after that, his bestfriend was trying to make me stay away from my then boyfriend. he said you don't deserve him and all that crap. you deserve better and all..

at that time also my gut was screaming, did they add in some drvgs, or viagra, or alcohol.. cuz they were so sketchy about everything

We became friends quickly and hung out a lot. I also became friends with his mum let’s call her Jen. I was missing my family, and it felt nice to be welcomed into their home. I ended up getting a little too close with Jen. At first, we kept it a secret, but eventually the guilt got to her and she confessed to Matt. At first, he said he didn’t care and seemed okay at first so I was relieved and I dated jen for a while but I could tell something was off. He no longer wanted to have lunch with me  and wasn’t as chill with me anymore. I felt terrible about it and talked to Jen, and we decided it was best to end things. I moved away to a different state when I graduated and got a new job. I haven’t seen either of them in many years.

A little over two weeks ago, I went back. I wasn’t exactly intending to visit them, but I happened to be in the area and got curious, so I decided to see if they still lived in the same place. I found Jen there, and she seemed a bit off like she wasn’t exactly happy to see me. I talked to her, and eventually she loosened up and invited me in for coffee. We talked and caught up. I’m married now and have a son, and she seemed curious about my life. Still, I could tell she seemed rather sad. I asked her about Matt, and she got awfully quiet and kept dodging the question. In the end, I just straight up asked her if everything was okay. She seemed different not how I remembered her.

She told me that Matt moved out a few months after I left and barely stayed in touch. At first, she didn’t think much of it, but he started making excuses whenever she wanted to see him and basically avoided her. They would meet once every few months at best. Then apparently he met a girl and pretty much ceased contact with her entirely and didn’t even invite her to his wedding. She hasn’t seen or heard from him in almost ten years. She might have grandkids, and they might not even know her.

When she said that, I felt a knot in my stomach. I knew Matt was very close with his mum, just like my own son is with his mom my wife. I know she didn’t exactly say he abandoned her because of me, but I could tell, and that guilt has been eating me up. We didn’t talk much after that, and I decided to leave. We didn’t even bother exchanging socials or anything. I just feel like I’ve ruined everything. Everywhere I go, I screw everything up. Matt was so close with his mum, just like my son is with his, and the thought that I might have been the one who shattered that kind of bond makes me sick. I look at my own kid and imagine him growing up, loving his mother the way Matt once did, and it hits me that I may have helped destroy something sacred and irreplaceable. Thinking that I could be the homewrecker who caused that makes me feel like the worst person in the world",26,1770728524.0,offmychest,24,0.89,False

The house across the field.,"You ever have a memory you wish ya could just burn out of ya skull? A memory that pops up every now & again and when it does all the same damn feelings come flooding back?. One of those memories that make you sick to ya stomach? one that feels like a dream you can't wake from?

I wish it was a dream. 

I wish I could go back to that weekend when the only thing I was worried about was Rico’s cheap damn combos in Street Fighter.





But the air in Detroit is heavy with things that aren't supposed to be there. This is how it started for me. This is what I want to forget.

You know that feeling when you’re being watched, but the person watching you is a mile away? That was Faircrest at dusk.

I was sitting on the floor of my friend Rico’s living room. The SNES was humming, the TV screen throwing jagged blue and purple light over the walls. Rico was leaning so far forward he was practically inside the tube, his tongue poking out the corner of his mouth.

""You better not hit that cheap move again, Rico,"" I warned, my thumbs aching from gripping the controller too hard.

""You just mad 'cause you losing, Ant,"" he shot back, a wicked grin splitting his face.

""I ain't losing. The controller’s sticking.""

""You finna lose,"" he cackled.





On the screen, Blanka let out a digitized screech and electrocuted my character into a pile of pixels. I groaned, dropping the controller against my chest. ""Man, that character is broken.""

Rico didn't even look up. ""Life’s broken, man. Adapt.""

Behind us, Rico’s older sister, Rochelle, was sprawled across the couch. She had a textbook open, but she’d been staring at the same page for twenty minutes. She kicked Rico’s shoulder with a socked foot. ""You two sound like you’re arguing over rent money. Keep it down before Ma hears you.""

""If it was real money, I’d be a millionaire,"" I joked, though my heart wasn't really in it.

I looked toward the window. Outside, the sun was sinking, smearing a bruised orange light across the abandoned field next door. During the day, it was just a dump—broken 40oz bottles, waist-high weeds, and the empty patches of dirt where the city had ripped out three houses years ago.

But at night? At night, that field looked wider. It looked like it was stretching.





The house was sitting right there on the edge of the property line. The one the city missed. It was a rotting, three-story Victorian that leaned to the left, like it was trying to whisper something to the house next to it. No one lived there. No one even tagged it with graffiti. Even the crackheads stayed clear.

""Yo, Ant,"" Rico said, snapping me out of it. ""You staying the whole weekend, right?""

""Yeah,"" I said, pulling my eyes away from the dark window. ""My mom said it’s cool. She said Rochelle is scarier than most dudes anyway, so if ya mom does have to leave for something I’d be safe."" 

Rochelle smirked, her eyes still on her book. ""Accurate.""

I've known Rico and Rochelle, for what felt like forever, we went to the same school, our moms were even friends and they both have the same name ""Michelle.""

The mood was perfect. Simple. The rattle of the box fan, the smell of fried chicken from down the block, and the low-frequency hum of the city. Then, the knock came.

It wasn't a normal knock. It was hard, rhythmic, and confident. Like whoever was out there was already stepping inside in their mind.

Rochelle sighed, moving to the door. ""Watch. It's the whole circus.""

She was right. Kim burst in first, loud and bright, followed by Tyson—who was already heading for the kitchen to see what was in the fridge—and finally Tasha. Tasha was the one who made me uneasy. She didn't walk into a room; she drifted. She stayed near the door, her eyes flicking to the corners of the ceiling before she looked at any of us.

""Why y'all house always smell like food?"" Kim asked, plopping down next to me and making the couch protest.

""Because we eat, Kim. Try it sometime,"" Rochelle said, closing her book.





The room filled with the kind of noise that usually makes you feel safe. Jokes, insults, the sound of Tyson raiding the sausage from the stove. But every time the streetlight outside flickered, the shadows in the hallway seemed to jump just a little too far.

""Anybody wanna hear something creepy?"" Kim asked, her voice dropping an octave.

Rico rolled his eyes. ""Man, y'all always on that ghost stuff.""

Tyson walked back in, chewing on a piece of sausage link. He leaned against the doorframe, his shadow stretching halfway across the floor. ""Depends. You want the fake stuff, or the stuff that actually happens on this block?""

I looked at the window again. The abandoned house across the field seemed closer now. Like it had moved a few inches while we weren't looking.

""What's real creepy, Tyson?"" I asked.

Tyson didn't smile. He just stared at the dark glass of the window. ""You ever hear of the Pig-Lady?""

The fan clicked. The TV buzzed. And for the first time that night, the house felt very, very cold.

Tyson let the silence sit there, heavy and suffocating, until the only sound was the rhythmic clack-clack-clack of the box fan.

""The Pig-Lady,"" he finally repeated, his voice barely a whisper. ""Folks say she lived in the slaughterhouse district back in the '40s. Something went wrong—a fire, or maybe something she did to herself. Now, she don't have a face. Not a human one, anyway.""





Rico let out a jagged, nervous laugh. ""Man, that’s just some urban legend to keep us off the property.""

""Is it?"" Tasha spoke up from her corner. She hadn't moved since she entered. Her eyes were fixed on the reflection in the darkened TV screen. ""My grandma says the ground under that field is sour. She says when the city tore those houses down, they did it because the houses were... screaming.""

""Alright, enough,"" Rochelle snapped, though I noticed her fingers were white where she gripped the edge of her textbook. ""It's Friday night. We aren't doing this.""

But the seed was planted. I could feel a low-level hum in the back of my skull. Every time I looked at the window, the reflection of the living room felt wrong. It was like the room in the glass was a second late catching up to our movements.

""I bet y'all wouldn't even walk to the porch,"" Kim teased, her eyes gleaming with that reckless energy she always had. ""me and Rico gave each other that look, like we about to run just talking about it.""

""I ain't scared of no old house,"" Rico barked, though he didn't move.

""Prove it,"" Kim challenged. ""Truth or Dare. And I already know what the dare is.""

""Truth or Dare?"" Rochelle laughed, but it was a dry, humorless sound. She slammed her textbook shut, the dust motes dancing in the lamplight. 

""Absolutely not. 





Every time we play that, someone ends up crying, or the cops end up at the door because Kim dared someone to throw eggs at a patrol car. We’re staying inside. We’re being civilized.""

""Civilized is boring, Ro,"" Tyson groaned, his massive frame shifting in the recliner. He’d finished the sausages and was now eyeing a bowl of stale chips.

""Besides, Ant is staying the whole weekend. Rico just told us. You really gonna make us leave him here to just play Street Fighter until his thumbs bleed?""

""Wait, Ant’s staying?"" Kim’s eyes lit up with a predatory sort of glee. She turned to me. ""And you didn't say nothing? Man, if I gotta go back to my house and listen to my auntie argue with the cable company all night, I’m gonna lose it.""

""Can we stay?"" Tasha asked quietly. It was the most she’d spoken all night. She was still tucked into the corner near the hallway, her fingers nervously twisting a loose thread on her hoodie. ""My house feels… loud tonight. I don't want to be there.""

Rico looked at Rochelle. Rochelle looked at the ceiling, praying for patience.

""Please?"" Kim begged, pouting with exaggerated drama like usual. ""We’ll be good. We’ll even help with the dishes. Maybe.""

""Ma’s gonna kill us,"" Rico muttered, though I could see he wanted the company. 

The house felt too big with just the three of us when the sun went down.

""She’s about to head out for her shift,"" Rochelle said, checking her watch. ""If she says yes, you stay. If she says no, you’re out the door the second her car pulls out the driveway. Understood?""

A chorus of ""bet"" and ""thank you"" erupted. 





A few minutes later, Michelle—Rico and Rochelle’s mom came down the hall in her nurse’s scrubs, smelling like peppermint and industrial soap. 

She was tired, the dark circles under her eyes deep enough to hold shadows, but she had that soft, ""Mom"" heart.

""Fine,"" she sighed, pointing a finger at Tyson. ""But if I come home and my fridge is empty, Tyson, you’re paying me back in manual labor. And Rochelle is in charge. I mean it. No wandering, no trouble.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" the of them said in a practiced, perfect unison.

We watched from the window as her taillights faded into the Detroit haze. 

The second the sound of her engine vanished, the atmosphere shifted. The ""grown-up"" air left the room, replaced by a jittery, electric tension.

""Alright,"" Kim said, dropping onto the floor and crossing her legs. ""Since Rochelle is a fun-killer and won't let us play Truth or Dare yet… let's talk about why we’re actually staying. Let's talk about the stuff people don't say out loud.""

""You mean...ghost stories?"" I asked, trying to sound braver than I felt.

""Real ones,"" Tyson said.

We went around the circle. Kim told a story about some ""Hitchhiker of 8-Mile"" that felt like something she’d read on a forum. 

Rico told a story about a haunted barber shop on the West Side that made us laugh more than scream. 





But then Tasha spoke.

""My grandma,"" she started, her voice so low we had to lean in, ""she says that before the city tore those three houses down across the field, there was someone who lived in the middle one. 

They kept animals in the basement. Not for food. For company. She said that they started sounding like those animals. Grunting. Squealing. 

One night, the neighbors heard a scream that sounded like a person being put through a meat grinder. When the police came… the person who lived there was gone. But the animals were fat. Real fat. And they had human hair stuck in their teeth.""

Silence fell over the room. The box fan clicked. Clack. Clack. Clack.

""That’s just a story, Tasha,"" Rico said, his voice cracking slightly.

""Then why did the city tear the houses down?"" Tasha asked. ""Nothing grows there, Rico. Not even the weeds look right.""





""Man, whatever,"" Tyson said, clapping his hands together to break the spell. ""I’m bored of talking. Let’s do it. Truth or Dare. Right now. Simple stuff first to get the blood flowing.""

We started easy. Rico had to call his crush and hang up (he turned bright red). 

Kim had to do a handstand against the door for thirty seconds. 

Tyson had to eat a spoonful of hot sauce and mustard. We were laughing, the dread from Tasha’s story beginning to recede.

Then Kim turned to me and Rico. Her smile wasn't friendly anymore. It was sharp.

""Ant. Rico,"" she said. ""I dare you both to go out there. Walk across the field. Stand on the porch of the House. Count to ten. Then come back.""

My stomach did a slow, cold roll. I looked at Rico. He looked like he wanted to vanish into the floorboards.

""The House?"" I whispered.

""The House,"" Kim reaffirmed. ""Unless you're both just talk.""

The room went quiet again. The flickering streetlight outside cast a long, skeletal shadow of the window frame across the floor, pointing straight toward the field.

""Fine,"" I said, my voice sounding like it belonged to someone else. ""We'll do it.""





The air outside the front door was different from the air inside. 

Inside, it was heavy with the smell of Rico's house—old carpet, Pine-Sol, and the lingering scent of fried sausage. 

Outside, the night felt hollow. It was that weird, dead silence you only get in the city when the wind dies down and the streetlights hum just a little too loud.

""We don't have to do this, Ant,"" Rico whispered as we stepped onto the sidewalk. His voice was thin, like paper tearing.

""And let Kim hold this over us for the rest of the year? Nah,"" I said, though my legs felt like they were made of lead. 

""Ten seconds, Rico. We count fast, we run back. Easy.""

We stepped off the concrete and into the field.

The grass wasn't just overgrown; it was thick and oily, dragging against our shins. Every step felt like the ground was trying to hold onto us. 

As we approached the House, the light from the streetlamps seemed to fail. 

It didn't just get darker; the light seemed to be repelled by the structure, curving around it like water around a stone.

The House loomed. Up close, the rotting Victorian looked less like a building and more like a carcass. The wood was grey and peeling, like dead skin. 

We reached the porch. The steps groaned under our weight—a deep, wet sound, like a bone snapping in slow motion.

""One,"" I whispered. ""Two,"" Rico countered, his eyes darting toward the black void of the front window. ""Three. Four...""

At ""five,"" the sound started. 

It came from right behind the front door. It wasn't a knock. It was a rhythmic, wet thud-thud-thud, like something heavy and fleshy was being swung against the wood from the inside. Then, a long, rattling breath—congested, bubbling with fluid—followed by a sharp, guttural sound.





Rico didn't even wait for ""six."" 

He spun around and bolted. I was right on his heels, my heart hammering so hard it felt like it was going to burst through my ribs. 

We scrambled back across the field, the weeds hissing against our clothes, until we burst through Rico’s front door and slammed it shut, sliding the deadbolt home with a frantic click.

""Whoa, whoa!"" Tyson laughed, jumping back from the door. ""Y'all look like you saw the devil himself.""

""Something was in there,"" Rico gasped, doubled over with his hands on his knees, his face the color of ash. ""Something big. It hit the door. It... it sounded like an animal.""

Kim crossed her arms, a skeptical smirk on her face. ""Man, please. It was probably a stray dog or a squatter. You didn't even stay for the full ten seconds. I was watching through the window. You hit that porch and turned tail in five.""

""It wasn't a dog, Kim!"" I snapped, my hands still shaking. ""I'm telling you, it was right there. Right behind the wood.""

""You guys didn't do the dare right,"" Kim insisted, shaking her head. ""A dare is a dare. If you don't finish it, it doesn't count. You’re officially the biggest scrubs.""

""Scrubs?"" Rico bristled, his fear suddenly turning into defensive anger. ""We went out there! I didn't see you moving toward the door! You're sitting here acting tough behind a locked deadbolt. You’re the chicken, Kim. You and Tyson and Tasha.""

""I ain't no chicken,"" Tyson growled, standing up. ""I'll go right now.""





""Then let's go,"" I challenged, the adrenaline making me reckless. 

""Since you’re so brave, Tyson. Let’s all go. If it’s just a squatter, then six of us can handle it.""

""No,"" Rochelle said firmly, standing up from the couch. ""Nobody is going back out there. Ma said stay inside.""

""Oh, come on, Ro,"" Kim teased. ""You scared too? The big bad babysitter is afraid of an empty house?""

""I'm not afraid,"" Rochelle narrowed her eyes. ""I'm being smart.""

""You're being a scrub,"" Rico chimed in, emboldened by my side. ""A total scrub. Just admit you're terrified of a pile of old wood.""

The bickering went on for ten minutes—the kind of circular, ego-driven arguing that only happens when you trying to prove you aren't the weakest link. Eventually, the pressure shifted. The room felt smaller, the air tighter. 

Maybe it was the peer pressure, or maybe it was something pulling at us, but the decision was made.

""Fine,"" Rochelle snapped, grabbing her heavy flashlight from the kitchen drawer. ""Three minutes. We go in, we stand in the foyer, we come back. That’s it. Then we lock the door for the rest of the weekend and I don't want to hear another word about that house.""





We walked out as a group this time. The six of us, shoulder to shoulder.

As we crossed the field, the temperature dropped. Not a breeze, just a sudden, bone-deep chill. Tasha stopped at the edge of the dirt.

""I don't like this,"" she whispered, her eyes fixed on the upper windows. ""The house... it looks different from here. Like it's taller.""

""It's just the angle, Tasha. Stay close,"" Tyson said, though he was gripping her arm tighter than he needed to.

As we stepped onto the porch, the smell hit us. It was a thick scent of old grease and copper. 

It smelled like a butcher shop that had been left in the sun.

Rochelle pushed the front door. It didn't creak; it swung open silently, as if the hinges had been freshly oiled.

The foyer was a cavern of shadows. Rochelle’s flashlight beam cut through the dark, revealing peeling wallpaper and a floor covered in a thick layer of grey dust—except for the center of the room. The dust there had been swept away, leaving a clean, circular patch.

""See?"" Kim whispered, her voice wavering despite her bravado. ""Nothing here. Just an old—""

Creak.

It came from above us. A slow, heavy footstep. Then another. Thud. Thud. Thud.

""Someone is upstairs,"" Tyson whispered, his voice dropping an octave.

I looked toward the back of the house. In the kitchen, I saw a shadow move. 





Not a person-shaped shadow—it was too wide, too low to the ground. It darted across the doorway and vanished.

""Did you see that?"" I asked, my throat dry.

""See what?"" Rico asked, but he was staring at the hallway mirror. ""Ant... look at the mirror.""

The mirror was cracked, a jagged line splitting it in half. In the reflection, the hallway behind us wasn't empty. There were shapes—pale, blurred faces peering out from the darkness of the dining room. But when I turned around, there was nothing but shadows.

""I feel sick,"" Tasha said, her breath hitching. ""The walls... they’re vibrating.""

She was right. I put my hand against the foyer wall. It wasn't solid. It felt like it was pulsing, 

a slow, rhythmic throb that matched the heavy footsteps upstairs.

Suddenly, the silence was shattered.

CRASH.

A sound like a thousand panes of glass shattering exploded from the basement. It was followed by a horrific, metallic screech—the sound of iron being twisted and torn apart. The entire house shuddered, the floorboards bucking under our feet.

""GET OUT!"" Tyson screamed.

We didn't need to be told twice. We scrambled for the door, tumbling over each other in a blind panic. We didn't stop until we were back in Rico's living room, gasping for air, the sound of that basement crash still ringing in our ears like a physical bruise.

We slammed the door and locked it. But as I looked at the wood of the door, I realized something.

The thudding from earlier hadn't stopped. It was just quieter now. 





The living room felt different when we burst back in. It wasn't just that we were spooked; the space itself felt like it had been violated. 

The warmth was gone, replaced by a damp, stagnant chill that seemed to seep out of the vents.

""Did you hear that? That wasn't no squatter!"" Rico yelled, his chest heaving. 

""That sound in the basement... that was metal. Like someone was ripping the furnace out of the floor!""

Tyson slammed his back against the front door, his eyes wide. ""I'm tellin' y'all, I saw something in the kitchen. It was too big to be a dog. It was like... grey. And slick.""

""Y'all are just trippin' now,"" Kim snapped, though her hands were shoved deep into her pockets to hide the shaking. 

""Fear makes you see stuff. Adrenaline, man. We went in, we got scared, we ran. That’s it. It’s over.""

""It's not over,"" Tasha whispered, sitting on the very edge of the couch. I can still feel it. Like a ringing in my ears.""





We spent the next hour bickering, trying to rationalize the irrational. 

Rochelle was pacing, her face set in a hard mask of ""big sister"" responsibility.

""Everyone just calm down,"" she commanded. ""It’s 11:30. We’re inside. The door is locked. We are fine."" 

She walked over to the coffee table where she’d left her schoolwork. She paused, her brow furrowed. ""Wait... where's my Trig book?""

""You probably left it in the kitchen,"" I said.

""No, Ant. I left it right here. On top of my notebook.""

The book was gone. Not just moved—gone. We checked under the couch, the kitchen table, even the bathroom. Nothing. It was like the house had simply swallowed it.

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

We all jumped. The sound was coming from the kitchen. We scrambled in to find the microwave running. The timer was counting down from 99:99, and the turntable was spinning empty.

""Who touched the microwave?"" Rochelle demanded.

""Nobody's been in here!"" Rico shouted, hitting the 'Cancel' button. 

The machine died, but the smell of burnt popcorn and old copper—the same smell from the House—wafted out of the vents.





A minute later, Kim went to the bathroom to splash water on her face. 

We were all still in the kitchen when we heard the scream. It wasn't a ""scary movie"" scream; it was a genuine, throat-tearing shriek of pure terror.

We found her collapsed on the bathroom floor, pointing at the vanity mirror.

""His face!"" she sobbed, clutching Rochelle’s waist. ""Tyson... I looked in the mirror, and Tyson was standing behind me, 

but he didn't have no eyes! Just black holes and... and hair! 

Long, black hair coming out of his mouth!""

Tyson looked at his own reflection. He looked normal. 

Terrified, but normal. ""I’m right here, Kim! I didn't even leave the hallway!""

""It’s the house,"" Tasha said, her voice dead and flat. 

By 1:00 AM, we tried to force a sense of normalcy. Rico popped a VHS of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into the player.

""Just watch the movie,"" he muttered. ""Focus on the turtles. Focus on New York. Not Detroit.""

We huddled together on the floor and the couch. 





For twenty minutes, it worked. 

Michelangelo was making jokes about pizza, and we were actually starting to breathe again. 

Then, the screen glitched. High-voltage static tore across the image, turning the green of the turtles into a sickly, bruised purple.

The audio slowed down, the voices dropping into a deep, demonic growl. The scene shifted. 

It wasn't New York anymore. It was a grainy, black-and-white shot of a basement. 

Rico's basement. I saw the stairs—the ones we had walked past a hundred times. 

A figure was huddled in the corner, wrapped in a tattered floral dress. She was hunched over something, her back to the camera.

Then, she turned her head. It wasn't a face. It was a snout. Wet, pink, and twitching.





The screen snapped back to the movie. Leonardo was swinging his katanas.

""Did... did y'all see that?"" I asked, my voice trembling.

""See what?"" Tyson asked, though he was gripping the armrest so hard his knuckles were white. 

""It was just a tracking error. Old tape, Ant. Just an old tape.""

Around 2:30 AM, screams started outside. They were distant at first, echoing down the block. 

It sounded like someone being chased, or maybe a drunk losing their mind.

""Just crackheads,"" Rico whispered, though he didn't sound convinced. ""Block is always loud on Fridays.""

But the screams didn't move past the house. They stayed right outside the window. 

And then, they changed. They didn't sound like screams anymore. 

They sounded like someone trying to imitate a human voice—a high, mocking ""Help me! Please help me!"" that ended in a wet, rhythmic snorting.





We decided to sleep in a pack in the living room. Lights on, TV on mute.

Sleep was a joke. I’d drift off for ten minutes only to wake up because I felt something brushing against my hair. 

I’d look up and see a shape—a tall, hunched shadow—standing by the coat rack. 

But when I rubbed my eyes, it was just the coats.

""Ant,"" Rico whispered from the floor beside me. ""Did you say my name?""

""No, man.""

""Someone whispered 'Rico' right in my ear,"" he said, his voice shaking. 

""It sounded like my mom, but... but wrong. Like she was talking through water.""

At 4:00 AM, every light in the house—the lamps, the overheads, the porch light—snapped on at once. 

The glare was blinding. We all bolted upright, shielding our eyes. A second later, they all died. Complete, crushing darkness.

""Rochelle?"" I called out.

""I’m here,"" she gasped. ""Nobody move.""

Then came the sound.

Jiggle. Jiggle. Scrape.





Someone was at the front door. Not knocking. 

They were trying the handle. Slow. Deliberate. 

Then, the sound of a key—or something like a key—scraping against the lock.

Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.

Tyson grabbed a baseball bat from the corner and crept toward the door, his breath shaky. He looked through the peephole. 

He stayed there for a long time, frozen.

""Tyson?"" I whispered. ""Who is it?""

He backed away from the door, his face completely bloodless. 

""Nobody,"" he whispered. ""There’s nobody on the porch. But the handle... the handle is still turning.""

We watched as the brass knob twisted all the way to the left, then all the way to the right. Over and over. For twenty minutes.

None of us slept after that. 

We sat in the dark, listening to the house breathe. 

When the first grey light of Saturday morning finally bled through the curtains, we weren't relieved. We were exhausted, frayed, and haunted.





We looked at each other in the morning light. 

We looked like we’d aged ten years. Tasha was staring at the wall, her eyes unfocused.

""It’s Saturday,"" I said, trying to find a spark of hope. 

But as I looked at the front door, I saw something that made my heart stop. 

On the inside of the door, right above the deadbolt, were three deep, vertical gouges in the wood. Like claws had been trying to get out.

""Look at the door,"" I whispered, my voice sounding like I’d swallowed gravel.

The others crowded around. Rico reached out, his fingers hovering just inches from the three deep, jagged gouges in the wood. 

They weren't just scratches; the wood had been splintered and peeled back, as if something with incredible strength—and no patience—had been raking at the door from the inside.





""That wasn't there when Ma left,"" Rochelle said, her voice trembling. ""I cleaned this door yesterday. I would’ve seen that.""

""Maybe it's the wood rotting?"" Kim suggested, though she sounded like she was trying to convince herself.

""Wood doesn't rot into claw marks, Kim,"" Tyson snapped. He rubbed his eyes, his face etched with exhaustion. 

""Man, I didn't sleep for more than twenty minutes. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard that... that sound. 

Like it was right under the floorboards.""

""I'm going home,"" Tasha said suddenly. She was standing by the window, her arms wrapped so tightly around herself it looked like she was trying to disappear. ""I can't stay here.""

""Tasha, wait,"" Rochelle said, stepping toward her. ""You can't leave me here with just the boys all weekend. 

My mom won't be back until Monday morning, you know on Saturdays and Sundays she go to her man's house after work. Please stay.""

""Yeah, girl,"" Kim added, throwing a subtle, playful look my way 

that felt completely out of place given the gouges on the door. 

""I didn't say I was going home. If Ant is staying, I’m staying. We just need to reset. Get some fresh air. Get away from this block for a minute.""

Tyson nodded, leaning his head against the wall. 

""If Ant is in, I'm in. Rico's mom already said it was cool. We just need to move around. I feel like I'm stagnant in here.""





Tasha looked at all of us, her gaze lingering on the field outside. She sighed, a long, defeated sound. 

""Fine. I’ll stay. But I need to get clothes. And my toothbrush. I can't stay in these clothes for two more days.""

""Me too,"" Kim and Tyson said in unison.

""I'm starving,"" Rico groaned, his stomach letting out a loud growl. 

""Let's hit the Coney Island down the street for breakfast. I got some money left."" 

""I can pay."" 

""We can pay, I added."" then we’ll hit Tasha’s house first since she’s the closest, then the rest of y’all.""

""Wait,"" Rochelle said, ever the general. ""Before we go anywhere, we are not leaving this house a mess. 

Put the blankets away, stack the pillows, and someone empty the trash. If Ma comes home to a wreck, 

we’re all dead, ghost or no ghost.""

We spent the next half hour in a blur of forced productivity. 

It felt good to move, to do something normal like folding a quilt, even if I kept glancing at the hallway mirror every time I passed it. 

By 9:00 AM, the sun was trying its best to pierce through the Detroit haze, and we stepped out onto Faircrest.

The walk to the Coney Island was quiet. We passed the field, and I swear the House looked smaller in the daylight—shabbier, less imposing. 

It was just a ruin. 

Or so I wanted to believe.





Inside the Coney Island, the smell of grease and grilled onions usually made my mouth water. Today, it made me nauseous.

We sat in a red vinyl booth that had seen better decades. A waitress with a tired bun and a name tag that said 'Doris' walked over, her notepad ready.

""What can I get you kids?"" she asked, her voice raspy from years of cigarettes.

""Breakfast platter, extra bacon,"" Tyson said.

Doris scribbled it down. ""One plate of raw dog, hold the hair,"" she muttered.

Tyson froze. ""Wait, what did you say?""

Doris looked up, blinking. ""I said, one breakfast platter, extra bacon. You okay, sugar? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Tyson swallowed hard. ""Yeah... yeah, my bad. I just... I misheard you.""

I looked over at the large mirror behind the counter. For a split second, I saw a reflection of our booth. 

But instead of the six of us, the booth was packed with shadows—dark, upright shapes with no features. 

I blinked, and it was just us again. Kim was checking her hair, and Rico was picking at a loose thread on the table.

Suddenly, the bell above the door chimed. I looked toward the entrance. 

A tall figure in a tattered floral dress stepped inside, its head ducked low. 

I felt a jolt of ice water hit my veins. Rochelle and Rico both jerked their heads toward the door at the same time.





But when the door finished swinging shut, there was no one there. The entryway was empty. The bell was still vibrating.

""Did you see—"" Rico started.

""Yeah,"" I whispered.

""See what?"" Kim asked, looking between us. ""Nobody came in.""

""Never mind,"" Rochelle said, though she was gripping her fork so hard her knuckles were white. ""Let's just eat and get out of here.""

After breakfast, we started the walk toward Tasha’s house. We had to cut through the edge of the local park. 

Usually, on a Saturday morning, you'd see kids on the swings or guys playing basketball. But the park was empty.

As we walked past the line of trees, I saw a shape in the distance. It was standing near the slide. It looked like a person, but the proportions were all wrong—the arms were too long, reaching down past its knees. It was hunched over, moving in a strange, jerky rhythm.

""Look,"" I pointed.

Tyson and Rico looked. The shape was there for a heartbeat, a dark blot against the rusted playground equipment. Then, we all blinked, and it was gone. Just the empty swing set, swaying slightly in a wind we couldn't feel.

""We need to hurry,"" Tasha whispered, her pace quickening. ""I don't want to be out here. I don't want to be anywhere.""

We kept moving, the sun feeling cold on our skin, instead of giving off its normal warmth.





A few hours have passed, since we went with Kim & them to get their stuff. On the way back we stopped at Wizard's Arcade.

The arcade was a neon-soaked cathedral of bleeps, bloops, and the heavy scent of ozone and floor wax. 

For a while, the 90s vibe of the place actually worked. 

We dropped our bags of clothes by the prize counter and dove into the rows of cabinets.

""Ant, if you pick Ryu one more time, I’m unplugging the machine,"" Rico shouted over the roar of Marvel vs. Capcom. ""You’re trash with anybody else!""

""I’m a specialist, Rico! There’s a difference!"" I shot back, slamming the buttons. 

""And don't talk to me about trash when you still can't beat the first boss in Metal Slug without using five continues.""

""Yo, move over,"" Tyson said, looming over us with a handful of quarters. ""Y'all both scrubs. I’ll run the winner.""

We were laughing, trash-talking like the night before was just a bad dream. 

Kim was dominating a Dance Dance Revolution machine, her movements sharp and confident, 

while Rochelle and Tasha hovered near the air hockey table. For two hours, we were just kids again.

But the arcade was... sick.

Every twenty minutes, the lights would dim, and the cabinets would let out a collective, electronic moan as the power surged.

""Sorry, babies!"" Mrs. Love, yelled from behind the counter. ""City’s been working on the lines all day. Transformers are acting up!"" 

Mrs. Love has been runnin' the place as long as any of us could remember.

We nodded, accepting the excuse, but the glitches started getting specific. 





I was playing Mortal Kombat when the screen tore. Instead of Sub-Zero, the pixels bled into a grainy image of a face—not a face, really, 

but a distorted mask of pink flesh with wet, black holes where eyes should be. 

I jumped back, but by the time the screen flickered again, the game was normal.

""Did you hear that?"" Tasha asked, walking over to us. She looked pale. 

""I was playing Pac-Man, and when I died, the speakers didn't make the 'womp-womp' sound. It sounded like... like someone screaming underwater.""

""It’s just a crowded arcade, Tasha,"" Tyson said, though he was staring at a Daytona USA machine that was showing a video of an empty,

dark hallway instead of a race track. ""All these machines are old as dirt. 

They’re bound to act weird with the power surges.""

Around 6:30 PM, the biggest surge yet hit. The arcade went pitch black for five full seconds. In that silence, the crowded room went dead quiet. 

No one moved. No one spoke. Then, the lights hummed back to life, and I looked out the front window.

The streetlights were already on. The orange glow was reflecting off the sidewalk like pools of oil.

""Time to go,"" Rochelle said, her voice leaving no room for argument. 

""We gotta get back before the neighborhood gets too rowdy.""





On the way back, we stopped at 'Ray’s Corner Store'.

""Alright, who's going in?"" I asked. ""Ray's gonna have a heart attack if all six of us walk in there at once. 

He already thinks we're a gang just because we're wearing hoodies.""

""I’ll go,"" Tyson said. ""I need my Red Faygo and some Hot Fries.""

""I'm going too,"" Kim said, grabbing Tyson’s arm. ""I need my chocolate. Ant, what you want?""

""Get me a Lemon-Lime Gatorade and some barbecue chips,"" I said. 

Rico and the girls gave their orders, and we watched Tyson and Kim disappear inside.

The four of us—Rochelle, Me, Tasha and Rico, waited on the sidewalk. 

The streetlights above us were buzzing with a high-pitched, angry hum, flickering in a way that made our shadows dance and stretch unnaturally.

""Today is just... off,"" Tasha whispered, looking up at the sky. ""It’s too quiet. Even for a Saturday.""

""It’s just the power stuff,"" Rochelle said, though she kept looking over her shoulder toward the field.

""The whole grid is probably messed up. Hey, Ant, when we get back, we finishing that Martin marathon?""

""Man, forget Martin,"" Rico chimed in. ""We gotta watch Tales from the Hood. It's a classic.""

BANG.





A massive, metallic crash echoed from the alleyway behind the store. It sounded like an industrial dumpster had been picked up and slammed 

against the brick wall. We all jumped, Rico nearly tripping over his own feet.

""What the hell was that?"" I hissed.

A second later, a scruffy-looking guy stumbled out from behind the trash bins, muttering to himself and kicking a loose can.

 He didn't even look at us as he wandered off down the street.

""Just a crackhead,"" Rochelle sighed, her hand over her heart. ""My god, we are all on edge.""

Tyson and Kim kicked the door open, laughing and carrying two plastic bags overflowing with junk food. 

Kim walked straight up to me, pulling out my Gatorade. She leaned in close, giving me a smirk and a quick wink.

""Here you go, Spec-Ops,"" she teased, her eyes lingering on mine for a second longer than usual. 

""Don't say I never did nothing for you.""





We turned onto Faircrest, the bags of snacks crinkling in the quiet night. But as we got within fifty yards of the house, the atmosphere curdled.

Every dog on the block started barking. Not the usual ""mailman is here"" bark, 

but a frantic, terrified howling. It was a chorus of desperate sounds, coming from backyards and porches all down the street. 

It felt like they were all facing the same direction.

They were barking at the field.

We stopped at the edge of Rico’s porch. The dogs were losing their minds, their voices raw and strained. 

We stood there for a long beat, looking at the empty lot next door. The House wasn't very visible in the dark, 

just a darker shape against the black sky.

""Inside,"" Rochelle whispered. ""Now.""

We didn't argue. We stepped inside and locked the door, but for the first time, the locks felt like they were made of glass.





The transition from the arcade's neon buzz to the suffocating quiet of the house was jarring.

We put on Martin, and for a while, the slapstick comedy and the canned laughter acted like a shield. 

We were laughing, shoving barbecue chips into our mouths, and acting like we weren't all hyper-aware of every floorboard that groaned.

But Tasha... she wasn't laughing. Every few minutes, her head would snap toward the window, her eyes fixed on the black void where the field began.

Around 9:00 PM, the house phone rang, the sharp, old-school trill making us all jump.

""Hey, Ma,"" Rochelle said, her voice instantly shifting into 'responsible daughter' mode. 

We could hear the muffled, scratchy voice of Michelle on the other end. 

""Yeah, we’re good. No, nobody’s been outside. Okay... yeah, the dresser? Got it."" She hung up and looked at us. 

""Ma said we can order pizza. She left money in her room.""

The argument over toppings was the most normal we had felt in forty-eight hours. Meat-lovers versus pepperoni, thin crust versus thick.

It was a beautiful, mundane distraction. By 10:00 PM, the pizza guy arrived. 

Rochelle paid him through a cracked door, her eyes scanning the dark porch before she snatched the boxes and slammed the bolt home.





We swapped over to Tales from the Hood. The irony of watching a horror movie wasn't lost on us, but it felt like if we leaned into the fear, 

maybe it would stop sneaking up on us.

Around 10:30 PM, the sky finally broke. 

A low rumble of thunder vibrated the floorboards, followed by a torrential downpour that turned the windows into blurred, weeping sheets of glass. 

The lightning was sudden and violent. During one particularly bright flash, the light hit the TV screen just right. 

I saw a reflection in the glass—someone standing right behind the couch. A tall, hunched shape with a thick, fleshy neck. 

I whipped my head around.

Nothing but the wall and the coat rack.

I looked at Rico. He wasn't watching the movie. He was staring at the window, his face illuminated by a jagged streak of lightning. 

""Ant,"" he whispered. ""I swear I just saw a light in the House. Like a candle moving past the upstairs window.""",1,1770728523.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

I’m looking for examples of copper bartop or countertop installation in Duluth. I’d like to examine them closely for construction techniques and how to finish the edges and transitions and all of the logistical details associated with that.

There are plenty of pictures on the Internet, but nothing is the same as being able to look at something up close. 

First preference would be a publicly accessible places like for example I’m going to stop into a tavern on the hill and look at those details, but I’m wondering if there are any other others around town that I don’t know about.

Second preference would be if you have a copper countertop, I would gladly trade a nice cup of coffee or six pack of your favorite beer or whatever for a few minutes of examination.

1r10214,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1r10214/carpet_cleaning_500_on_the_line/,Carpet Cleaning - £500 on the line!,"Hi r/CleaningTips,

I'd be really grateful for some advice on this one. We just moved out of a rented property, which we left in perfect condition... except for this stain on the carpet.

We're not quite sure what it is. It might be a coffee spill, which is most likely given that it's in a high coffee consumption zone. Or it could be a dog accident. We don't have a dog. But we have had a small dog to visit, and it looks like it could be...

Anyway, it seems that an initial clean with a regular carpet cleaning machine actually made things worse rather than better. It seemed to come up darker and with greater contrast to the carpet.

The trouble is that our landlord (although they've now sold the house and won't be returning) is threatening to withhold £500 from our deposit for a full carpet replacement, unless we can remove it. We're trying to negotiate this down to £200 or so. But I'd really prefer for it to be £0!

Really grateful for any product and method recommendations.

Thanks,  
CW

So long story short, I have been sitting on for a little bit hoping time will change things and the odd conversation of my frustrations. 

I work full-time, and the partner is a SAHM. To which I don’t have an issue with. In fact I encourage because I don’t like the idea of random people looking after our 1 yr at nursery with the astronomical costs these days. 

The problem I have. And it’s been like this for 6 months now. Our home is an absolute mess, every time. I get having children does not help things. But the wife is a big part of the problem. She has stacks of clothes everywhere. The stairs are a dumping ground for anything and everything. She leaves everything to the last minute or to the point where it piles so high that it can’t be ignored, and I get frustrated and just clean it out. And then literally one day later it’s back to how it was. If anyone comes over I have to spend half a day cleaning because it’s so embarrassing. 

I cook all meals, i do most the life admin, walk the dog(hers by the way- I didn’t want one as I knew it would be a full time commitment) I do the school runs at the expense of me running late for work most days. While she’s stays in bed with the baby, with breakfast in bed I may add. 

I often ask what she gets upto with day when I’m at work. Not to moan or anything just curious. And she just says not much. Had to put baby down for a nap, have lunch, and then pick up the eldest from school etc. and one day a week she religiously visits her parents, coffee and cake and generally a catch up for the whole day. And my efforts are not exactly appreciated. 

I feel like that I’m being mugged off. Am i expecting too much, that she should at least pull her weight and just at minimum and maintain a clean house? 

And to top it off, our intimacy is non existent, I have not even had a proper kiss from her for over a year now. I mean I don’t want sex on tap etc but there isn’t an inclination of being wanted. I mentioned this to her and it got laughed off and she dismissed it as it was like a chore that can be done another day. 

Not sure if she doesn’t find me attractive anymore. 

What’s worse we were casually talking about a parent of another child (male) and she spoke quite foundly of him. To which I bluntly said oh, guess you find him attractive. To which she hesitated and eventually said “well… he’s way on the eye for sure”. 

I’m at a loose end. 

Anyone else experience this? Or think I’m over reacting? 

Oh by the just to add - I have try to discuss the issues with her and she shoots me down and just says that’s who I am, just deal with it.

I’ll be honest — I never really *got* the adult coloring trend at first. I thought it was just about fancy pencils and mandalas on Instagram.  

Then one day, after a week that drained every ounce of calm I had left, I sat down with a simple coloring page. No music, no multitasking, no notifications. Just color filling space.  
Somewhere between the first shade of blue and the last stroke of green, I finally exhaled.  

That moment flipped a switch.  
Coloring isn’t just a pastime — it’s meditation for people who can’t sit still.  
It slows your racing thoughts, gives your hands something kind to do, and quietly reminds your brain how to rest.  

And because so many of us could use a bit of that stillness right now, I wanted to share something helpful:

\*\*Preparation\*\*



This was my first major competition and I wasn't quite sure how to prepare. The only thing I thought about was buying tickets early (thank you r/judo) and indeed, I managed to purchase them on the day (and hour, and minute) the sale was announced. I quickly reserved seats by the mat, and it was a very good decision because three days later only selected seats at the top of the hall were available.



Right after the GS tickets, I bought plane tickets - it was cheaper, but nothing spectacular - weekend flights to Paris are quite popular and rarely have bargain prices. With the tickets, I reserved a hotel - I was looking for something near Accor Arena and I found a place within 30 minutes' waking distance - I think location-wise a good choice. As for the hotel itself, this is the last time I'm booking a hotel in Paris, the price/quality ratio is tragic (!) - I stayed in a room where a bed fit with 50 cm on each side to the walls.



Before departure, I bought bus tickets - AeroBus. The ticket isn't expensive and is valid for 3 months from the indicated date, so nothing happens if you miss the bus you picked ;)



\*\*Arrival\*\*



We arrived in the morning, at 8:30, at Beauvais airport, 77 km from Paris itself. At 10:30 we were in Paris. The destination of this journey is the Porte Maillot bus station, right next to the metro, which you can take to get to your destination. We reached the hotel, checked in, left our luggage in the waiting room and went sightseeing. We returned in the evening, went to dinner and went to sleep (we got up that day at 3 AM to catch the plane), because wake-up was at 6:30.



\*\*Day 1\*\*



Early in the morning we got ready, ate breakfast at the hotel and went to the competition venue. Unfortunately, we didn't know if you could bring water or food into the hall (and information on the internet indicated that you can't bring anything into Accor Arena), so I didn't even have a backpack. On site it turned out there's security at the entrance, people have bags stuffed with food, clothes, flags, etc. and nobody minds. From the entrance to the hall to reaching our seats took about 10 minutes - everything went very smoothly. When we sat down, matches were already underway. Speaking of seats... I reserved seats in the lowest row, remembering from watching previous competitions that the mats are separated from the audience and the seats themselves start a bit higher. Not this time - we sat almost right by the mats, separated from the tatami by about a 1.5 m carpet strip where competitors and banners moved. That's all! Unfortunately, there are downsides - because of the banners you couldn't see what was happening at the edges of the mat, especially during newaza, and cameras blocked part of the view of the mats. Advantages? You can see exactly what sport judo is at a high level - respect for the opponent, small gestures on the tatami like patting on the back, mixed with brutal grip fighting, sweeps and very strong throws. Moreover, you can see how much the fight costs, not only physically but also emotionally - competitors leaving the mat could barely hold back their emotions and more than once their coaches couldn't control themselves. I won't comment on the fights because you can watch them on judotv. At one point we realized it was already the quarterfinals and the break was coming soon. The fights continued for about another hour and a half, but with good judo time flies by. The atmosphere in the hall is fantastic, but only when the French compete - all the local fans scream their support, clap with all their might and stomp. Such support must give an extra boost in the fight.



We got hungry, so we went for lunch to a restaurant about 15 minutes on foot from the hall - it was a good decision because everything in the immediate vicinity was very packed with people. Oh, don't be surprised, because when leaving the hall security checks tickets and there's a slight crowd at the doors. After returning to the hall, we walked around to see what you could buy, and if you're thinking about supplementing your training equipment, this is a good place - you can get everything for judo training (except maybe tatami) and personalize your belt/judogi. It's worth factoring this into the cost of the event.



After the break, the finals began - fights for bronze medals took place on the 2 middle mats and the fight for the gold medal on mat two - it's worth keeping this in mind when reserving seats. Fights in categories are interspersed with medal ceremonies for competitors. Here came the biggest drawback of our seats - mat 3, directly in front of me was blocked by a camera, half of mat two was blocked by another camera. Later it was better, the first cameraman sat down and that was enough to comfortably watch the bronze medal fight. After the fights ended, children run to the edge of the audience asking for photos and autographs. Unfortunately, spectators in the extreme seats (by the stairs) in a given row can't watch the ongoing match in peace. It didn't bother me, given that for kids, contact with competitors can be great motivation for continued training, but some people were irritated. As for autograph hunters, children don't always understand that a competitor is highly focused (before final fights) or is experiencing a loss and the last thing on their mind is an autograph or photo together.



The event ended around 20:00 (we didn't stay for Golden Score), after everything we went to dinner and to the hotel. 12 hours of watching competitions is quite tiring though, so it was hard to gather energy for further escapades around the city. Especially since the second day was still waiting for us.



\*\*Day 2\*\*



Wiser from the first day's experience, we packed our backpacks and headed to the hall to arrive for the first fights. We almost made it. Seats similar to yesterday, but visibility was better because we were closer to the side edge of the mat - almost in the very center of the hall. The atmosphere in the hall was similar to Saturday, and we were sitting close to Liz Ngelebeya's parents, so additional emotions were guaranteed.



Again, time flew by and the quarterfinals arrived, then the break. This time we went to a store near Gare du Nord to get supplies for lunch. It seemed to be a popular destination for both the audience and GS staff. On Sunday, some shops and restaurants in France are closed, so it's good to check this before going somewhere. We returned from shopping and went looking for coffee near Accor Arena. In the immediate vicinity of the hall there are some cafes and small restaurants, and judokas were hanging around there - we saw Zelim Kotsoyev standing outside a shop, Ushangi Kokauri going for coffee, Francesco Bruyere and Gennaro Pirelli walking around.



The time came for the finals and this time we got much better view on the tatami. The French went crazy when Alexis Mathieu won the bronze medal, and I thought the seats wouldn't withstand the cheering. The +78kg finals were complete madness - 4 French women in the finals, you don't know who to cheer for. The kids went crazy hunting for autographs and photos, unfortunately some adults were pushing their way through the kids to get a photo with medalists. On top of that, one of the kids spilled chips on the carpet where the competitors were walking, and nobody thought to clean it up.



The last category was +100 kg without local competitors, so the hall became quieter. In the fight for the gold medal, the hall cheered for Olivier Desroses, who was refereeing this fight. While it was funny for the first 20-30 seconds, it then became quite embarrassing because Ota and Nakano were the stars here. Unfortunately, we couldn't stay for the last medal ceremonies and left right after the +100kg final - as did most of the audience.



One thing I need to mention is how efficient the TV crew is - you only start to understand how professional they are and what it takes to film such a competition when you see it live.



Honorable mention, Tais Pina from Portugal, competing in -70kg. This girl gave it all on the tatami and it was very hard to watch her leave defeated in the fight for bronze.



\*\*Summary\*\*



Amazing! Next year I'll try to visit Paris again, this time better prepared. I'll also consider a seat in a higher row to eliminate visibility problems, especially since my period of asking competitors for autographs and photos is behind me, and some young judoka will make better use of my seat. I guess I need to get used to the French style of cheering ;)",25,1770728047.0,judo,2,1.0,False
