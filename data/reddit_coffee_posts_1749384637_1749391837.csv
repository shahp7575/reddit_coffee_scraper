Soft meat in suits, hunched under lights, rotting from the inside out.
So I killed one. A quiet man who worked in a building that hummed like a dying insect.

He didn’t scream.
He just looked tired when I ended him — like I’d stolen a burden, not a life.
I wore his skin to feed my own — brought meat back to the young who waited, blinking in the dark.

But I stayed too long.
They came faster than I thought — ORCL: Organism Recovery & Containment Logistics.
They don’t kill monsters. They study them. Break them.

Now I live as him.
I answer emails. I say “Happy Friday” and fake laugh at microwave noises in the break room.
If I don’t, I’ll be noticed. If I’m noticed, I disappear.

I used to run on four legs, breathe the sky, sleep beneath bark that remembers wind.
Now I sip burnt coffee and apologize for being five minutes late.

The meat I fed my family ran out weeks ago.
I can’t go back without being followed.
And if I vanish, ORCL will find them too.

At first, I laughed at the humans — how they lock themselves in windows and call it “ambition.”
But now I watch them die slowly.
One task at a time. One email. One scroll.

I begin to forget their name — the man I wore.
His wallet is still in the drawer.
Eric. He liked birds. He had a mother in Oregon. He played piano.

His reflection speaks to me now. Not mine.

I dream in his voice.
Sometimes I cry in it.

No one here looks at me too long.
No one ever asks how I am.
That’s the safest part — humans ignore what feels familiar.

I miss my real face. I miss the dark. I miss the ones I fed.
But I have to keep working.
Performance review is next week.

And still, when I sit in the break room and hear the sound of wings outside the window,
I wonder what it was all for.
I wonder who the real monster is — the one who hunted to feed,
or the one who dies slowly, pretending to live.",1,1749391733.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1l6cyg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/digestiveissues/comments/1l6cyg6/i_dont_think_i_have_ibs/,I don't think I have IBS,"21F woman here.

I was diagnosed with IBS 2 years ago with chronic gastritis. Sometimes I have pain and bloating in the gut. I’m slowly losing weight (1 kg per year), hair and energy. I wake up early in the morning with digestive discomfort. For 2 years, after I told my family doctor I had these symptoms, I was diagnosed with IBS because according to her, at my age, I can’t have serious diseases other than IBS. She told me I only had to adjust my diet and focus on stress management. So, I stopped eating some irritating foods like dairy products (except cheese), some vegetables and fruits, spicy and greasy foods, alcohol and coffee. But the symptoms never went away. I always had abnormal blood levels with a fall in white blood cells and increased immunoglobulins G and M and gamma globulins. But my family doctor told me it wasn’t alarming. She didn’t even notice I was losing weight too. 2 weeks ago, I had a new symptom and it was blood in the stools. I never had this before and it scares me because it came out of nowhere because my gut didn’t hurt that much at that moment. I noticed that my stools were thicker, harder and easier to evacuate. They used to be softer, stickier and harder to evacuate. I saw blood again this week. I had a bowel ache afterwards. I saw a gastroenterologist 2 weeks ago for a fibroscopy because I was concerned by my symptoms in the stomach related to gastritis because PPIs didn’t work anymore for me and caused side effects. I also told her about my abnormal stools and she told me it had to be IBS because I was too young to have something else. I will get a fibroscopy soon and I’m planning to ask for a colonoscopy too because the symptoms are really alarming. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to have a serious disease just because I wasn’t taken seriously by doctors. 

What do you think of my situation? I really want to know your experiences and I’d be glad to read some advice because this situation is really stressful. Moreover, I have many serious cases in my family like stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. It scares me even more and I feel like I can’t do much to improve this situation. ",1,1749391540.0,digestiveissues,1,1.0,False

Current planning restrictions prohibit building in woodlands in the U.K. This cabin was built in approximately 1910. Please share our listing and spread the word so we can find the right buyer for our pride and joy.

This property consists of two stunning fully off grid cabins situated in an ancient woodland in Northumberland. It is classed as an ancient woodland because it is over 400 years old. In the springtime the woods is blanketed with blue bell flowers, wild garlic and snowdrops.  The woodland is teeming with wildlife such as newts, toads, red kites, badgers, hedgehogs, rabbits, hares and deer. The area has lots of foot paths for endless dog walks. 

The cabin site consists of 10 cabins. This is the first time one is being advertised on the open market, before now they were sold behind closed doors privately. 

The dawn chorus every morning is simply breathtaking. The cabins are turn key ready for you to move in and getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is conveniently located 10 miles drive away from Newcastle upon Tyne, 5 hours from London or 12 mins walk from the train station. 

Although you’re surrounded by nature, the property is also close to various amenities such as a supermarket which is only is a short 5 minutes drive away, a good local pub and a village store is just 10 minutes walk from the cabin. If a pub within walking distance is not your cup of tea you could join the local fishing or canoeing club. 

The larger cabin comprises of a main living area, a kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms and a porch with a log store fully stocked with firewood for next winter. The smaller cabin is a one bedroom guesthouse with a shower and canter lever double bed. The garden space is very generous at 10 x 40 meters, it has lots of established willow trees and is lined with cobble stone paths. We have strawberries, cherry, apple and pear trees plus blackberry and raspberry bushes. To the right of the property there is a 5 meter wide geo dome which is ideal for growing vegetables, herbs and other plants. It can also be upgraded into a green house to grow a wider variety of food. 
Between the larger and the smaller cabin there is a decked area  which we use to exercise and has a fire pit. The is also an outdoor compost toilet as well as a tool shed for extra storage. 

The cabins are fully off grid and were professionally wired and signed off by an electrician with 240 volts plugs in every room, 12 volts lighting and plenty of usb sockets all running off 4 large solar panels powering 2 separate battery banks with a backup 3000 watts electric start Honda generator. The cabins are equipped with a Netgear internet router and an Ariel on the roof providing 24/7 5G broadband. Both cabins are fully plumbed in with hot & cold running water throughout provided by two Calor gas boilers. The cabins have large log burners which thump out the heat on cold winter nights.

The kitchen in the larger cabin is equipped with gas powered hobs, a blue tiled back splash, raw living wood countertop, a stainless steel sink as well as plenty of cupboard & shelving space. 
The living room is spacious and is centred around our stunning red combo log fire and oven. It has a comfy blue vintage ercol sofa, a six seater dining table and a storage cupboard.  
Bedroom 1 has floor to ceiling windows where you can often see deers and squirrels running past. It has a double bed with lots of under bed storage space aswell well as a wardrobe. 
Bedroom 2 has a top bunk double bed made of raw living wood, and an under bed wardrobe. 
The bathroom has a large roll top bath with floor to ceiling windows, it has a sink and a fully functioning compost toilet. 

The smaller cabin is furnished with a stunning canter lever bunk double bed made with living wood beams. It has an overhead rain shower, breakfast bar and kitchen space. There is a log fire and outdoor decking for lounging or your morning coffee. 

After a 100 years of private ownership, the woodland has recently been purchased by the Woodland Trust so now cabin owners have multigenerational security in their lease. The Woodland Trust is the UK’s largest woodland conservation charity, dedicated to protecting, restoring, and creating native woodlands.
The current lease for the past 100 years has been a rolling annual lease.
The lease states that the cabin is suitable for use all year round except for one week so it’s classed as a holiday let and is therefore eligible have no council tax bills. You’ll also be pleased to hear that the running costs and bills are refreshingly low. 

My husband has lived here for 5 years and got the keys just before lockdown. He love the off-grid lifestyle, but I don’t, especially now that we’ve also just had a baby — so we’re letting the cabins go as we prepare for a new chapter together. 

Proof of funds will be required before viewing. £165,000 or highest offer.

# Work Smarter, Create Faster

**1. Align Brand Faster: Brand Voice**

* **Old headache:** Every campaign, I’d spend hours rewriting copy to match our brand tone. Feedback loops dragged on forever.
* **What I tested:** Uploaded our tone guide once; Magic Write now drafts everything in our voice.
   * You can find “Brand Voice” inside Canva Docs → go to “Tools” in the top bar → select “Brand Voice”. Once you upload your tone guide, Magic Write will automatically use it to generate content that matches your voice.
* **What changed:** Copy review rounds dropped from 6 → 1. That freed \~5 staff-hours per asset.
* **Why you care:** Less time nit-picking tone = more bandwidth for headline A/B tests and campaign ideation, activities that actually move conversion numbers.

**2. Produce at Scale: Magic Media + Edit + Resize + Bulk Create**

* **Old headache:** Making one visual was fine. But resizing it manually for Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.? A nightmare.
* **What I tested:** Designed one master visual, hit Magic Resize and Bulk Create for eight placements.
   * *I created one main visual in Canva → clicked “Magic Resize” (in the top toolbar when editing your design) → selected all the platforms I needed (like IG Story, Facebook post, YouTube thumbnail, etc.).*
   * *Then I used “Bulk Create” (in the left sidebar under “Apps”) to automatically duplicate that visual across multiple text/image variations.*
   * *“Magic Media” (also under “Apps”) helps generate or edit photos using AI, like replacing the background or generating an image from text prompts.*
* **What changed:** My image prep time dropped from 4 hours → just 10 minutes. That’s a 96% cut. Across 4 campaigns a month, that’s an entire extra workday.
* **Why you care:** Instead of wasting time resizing and re-exporting, I now spend that time on creative tests, like experimenting with short videos or animated posts.

# Why This Post Is Worth Your 5 Minutes

* **Immediate wins:**
   * All of these tools are already inside your Canva dashboard, no need to install anything or train your team.
   * Setup takes less than 30 minutes.
* **Quantified impact:** I’ve logged an extra workday per month in Toggl just from switching workflows, you probably can too.
* **Apply tonight:** Log into Canva, go to Docs or any design, and try out “Magic Write”, “Brand Voice”, and “Magic Resize” today.

Here is a link to the old post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/1l5n2aq/how\_can\_i\_stay\_healthy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/1l5n2aq/how_can_i_stay_healthy/)

**You are what you consume:**  
The long-term consequences of regularly eating and drinking high-sugar, unhealthy foods include health issues like weight gain, energy crashes, and an increased risk of diabetes.

The healthiest alternative to sugary snacks is fruit, it's naturally sweet and packed with nutrients. My personal favourites are raspberries, blackberries, banana and kiwi

Carry a large water bottle and sip it throughout the day as opposed to sugary drinks that lead to energy crashes. I would recommend a stainless steal 2L one as plastic will break easily on the site.

It’s normal to see guys downing 4–5 cups of coffee before lunch or pounding monster drinks all day just to stay alert. It’s part of the culture, early mornings, long days. Relying on that much caffeine every day messes you up more than it helps.

You crash hard by mid-afternoon, your sleep gets wrecked (even if you don't notice it right away), and your natural energy just tanks over time. It becomes a cycle; wake up drained, slam caffeine, crash, repeat.

**Physical conditioning:**  
Deciding to be proactive with your health by Incorporating things like yoga, weight lifting, and daily stretching is helpful for long-term health. Neglecting these practices can lead to chronic back pain, joint problems, poor circulation, fatigue, and eventually missed work or even early retirement due to preventable injuries.

Weight training: helps builds strength helping to support your body through repetitive lifting, climbing, and awkward postures.

Yoga: and stretching improve flexibility, mobility, and balance, reducing your risk of injury from strains, sprains, or overuse.

Running: Builds endurance, and strengthens legs. Great for burning fat and boosting mental clarity. Helps you stay sharp and energized on long workdays.

Biking: Low-impact on joints, builds strong quads and glutes, and improves stamina. Ideal for active recovery or anyone wanting cardio without the wear and tear of running.

**Ergonomics & Tools:**  
Use proper lifting techniques & ask for help: Always lift with your legs, not your back. Use hand trucks, carts, or mechanical lifts when possible. Ask for help with heavy things—your back will thank you.

Always wear PPE: Wear knee pads (or pants with built-in padding), safety glasses, hearing protection, and respirators when needed. This helps prevent long-term damage to joints, hearing, and lungs.

Use the right tools for the job: Invest in quality tools like impact drivers and ergonomic screwdrivers. These reduce wrist strain, improve efficiency, and lower your risk of repetitive stress injuries.

**Recovery & Support:**   
Prioritize quality sleep: Deep sleep is when your body repairs muscle, restores energy, and regulates hormones. Aim for 7–9 hours of uninterrupted rest to feel sharp and recover properly.

Take rest days seriously: Use days off to fully rest or do light activity like walking or biking. Over training without recovery increases the risk of injury and burnout.

Use cold therapy (icing, cold plunges): Icing sore joints or using cold plunges helps reduce inflammation, especially after long days of bending, lifting, or working in cramped spaces. It’s great for knees, shoulders, and lower back.

Incorporate mobility work & stretching post-shift: Foam rolling, light yoga, and post-work stretching help flush out lactic acid, improve circulation, and keep joints loose. It prevents stiffness the next morning.

Use support gear wisely: Knee sleeves, compression socks, back braces, or suspenders for your tool belt can reduce strain and improve posture, especially if you’re on your feet all day.

Some extra tips I thought could help:  
\- Buy that big stainless steel bottle and make it a habit to fill it with water the night before your shift  
\- Pack your lunch with fruit instead of sweets  
\- Dedicate some time on Sunday to meal prep for the week to avoid those fast food meals (It'll save ya some money too)

# Work Smarter, Create Faster

**1. Align Brand Faster: Brand Voice**

* **Old headache:** Every campaign, I’d spend hours rewriting copy to match our brand tone. Feedback loops dragged on forever.
* **What I tested:** Uploaded our tone guide once; Magic Write now drafts everything in our voice.
   * You can find “Brand Voice” inside Canva Docs → go to “Tools” in the top bar → select “Brand Voice”. Once you upload your tone guide, Magic Write will automatically use it to generate content that matches your voice.
* **What changed:** Copy review rounds dropped from 6 → 1. That freed \~5 staff-hours per asset.
* **Why you care:** Less time nit-picking tone = more bandwidth for headline A/B tests and campaign ideation, activities that actually move conversion numbers.

**2. Produce at Scale: Magic Media + Edit + Resize + Bulk Create**

* **Old headache:** Making one visual was fine. But resizing it manually for Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.? A nightmare.
* **What I tested:** Designed one master visual, hit Magic Resize and Bulk Create for eight placements.
   * *I created one main visual in Canva → clicked “Magic Resize” (in the top toolbar when editing your design) → selected all the platforms I needed (like IG Story, Facebook post, YouTube thumbnail, etc.).*
   * *Then I used “Bulk Create” (in the left sidebar under “Apps”) to automatically duplicate that visual across multiple text/image variations.*
   * *“Magic Media” (also under “Apps”) helps generate or edit photos using AI, like replacing the background or generating an image from text prompts.*
* **What changed:** My image prep time dropped from 4 hours → just 10 minutes. That’s a 96% cut. Across 4 campaigns a month, that’s an entire extra workday.
* **Why you care:** Instead of wasting time resizing and re-exporting, I now spend that time on creative tests, like experimenting with short videos or animated posts.

# Why This Post Is Worth Your 5 Minutes

* **Immediate wins:**
   * All of these tools are already inside your Canva dashboard, no need to install anything or train your team.
   * Setup takes less than 30 minutes.
* **Quantified impact:** I’ve logged an extra workday per month in Toggl just from switching workflows, you probably can too.
* **Apply tonight:** Log into Canva, go to Docs or any design, and try out “Magic Write”, “Brand Voice”, and “Magic Resize” today.

the worst part? I had no idea what the hack was even doing anymore. spent way too long trying to mentally reconstruct what ""past me"" was thinking. eventually I tossed the whole file into blackbox to try and match similar code patterns and figure out if I was insane or just lazy (turns out it was both).

clever is cool until you’re the one untangling it later. write comments like you're explaining it to your future self after 3 cups of coffee and zero patience.

Writing a letter to someone I’ve never met. But for some reason, I felt like doing it anyway. No idea if it’ll reach the right person, but here I am.

I don’t really know what I’m hoping for with this. Maybe it’s connection. Maybe I’m just tired of feeling like something’s missing and needed to put this out there, somewhere. It’s not about being desperate. It’s more like wanting someone to finally get it.

So let me start with this.   
We don’t know each other yet and that’s kind of wild. Writing this not knowing if you’re even real or if we’ll ever meet. But maybe you're out there. And maybe one day, I’ll know what your laugh sounds like, what kind of music you listen to when you’re sad, or how you take your tea or coffee.

I want the small things. The daily stuff. The parts of a relationship that don’t show up in movies. Like sitting in silence without it feeling awkward. Or rushing through a Monday morning together. Or just grocery shopping and knowing each other’s favorite chips without asking.

I’m 23 now, trying to figure life out. I’ve got this project I’m super into. It’s nerdy but it gives me purpose.

Someday I want to live somewhere quiet, maybe in the hills, with a dog that runs around like it owns the place. I want to read books in the sun and forget what day it is. Simple stuff, really. But real.

I just hope I don’t lose myself trying to get there. I don’t want to turn into someone who lives only for deadlines and KPIs. I hope I still laugh at stupid jokes and cry at movies and get excited over small things when we meet.

Maybe you’re reading this now. Maybe you're just killing time, scrolling through Reddit. Or maybe you’re like me, stuck in your own head, wondering if you’re ever going to find someone who feels like home.

If we’ve already met and you’re reading this later, I hope you’re smiling and thinking, “God, he really went and wrote that.” Or maybe you're rolling your eyes. Fair enough.

Either way, I’m here. Trying. Hoping. Ready.

Lee muttered it at the sink, not loud, just rough enough to rattle the spoons floating in the greasy water. The murk smelled like yesterday’s sausage fat and burnt coffee. He pulled the plug and watched the mess spiral away.

Flora never lifted her head from the stack of invoices on the counter. Cigarette clamped between two yellowed fingers, she said, “Quit what, Brother?”

Nobody in Millhaven called him Lee anymore. Folks said Brother or, when the joke grew legs, Hollywood Brother, because of the crooked tattoo stretched across his knuckles—H O L L Y on one hand, W O O D on the other. Nine letters, eight knuckles: the Y jammed sideways into the soft web near his thumb like a punctuation error. The big laugh was that “Tinsel Town” had washed up in Ohio as one broke dishwasher who couldn’t even spell his dream across the proper number of fingers.

Brother didn’t rent an apartment; he slept out back in an old forty-foot freezer trailer Flora once used to store bulk flour and onions before the compressor died. He’d kicked the rats out one bad winter, swung a broom till the walls thudded, and claimed the metal box as home in exchange for soap-burned hands and a plate of food each shift. The place still smelled of spoiled starch and mouse nests, but a roof was a roof, and the price was right.

“I’m serious,” he said. His voice kept low so the tire-plant crew in the booths wouldn’t hear; men who measured worth in how little they spoke and how much they swallowed.

Flora finally lifted her eyes. They were pale and chipped like cracked teacups, but they could still cut. “Serious don’t change the lunch special,” she said. “Griddle’s cold. Fire it.”

Brother planted both hands on the stainless, knuckles white, Y crooked and angry. “You know what it’s like out there. I sleep beside rust. I piss in a Folgers can when the rain sheets too hard. If that’s a life, I ain’t figured the punch-line.”

Flora flicked ash, slow. “A life’s just hours strung together. Clock in, clock out, don’t die in between. Now gas on.”

Donny Finch swept through the front door with his usual tornado of cold air and cheap enthusiasm. Pen behind one ear, notebook underarm, he looked like a man playing reporter in a town with no news. “Smells like someone’s sermonizing,” he said, sliding onto a stool.

“Brother Hollywood’s quitting again,” Flora muttered.

Donny pulled out his notebook, scribbled something. “Must be Tuesday. That’s two times this month, going for a record?”

Brother opened his mouth, shut it. A low hiss rose from the range as he turned the knob. Blue fire licked iron; bacon slapped down and curled like it wanted to leave too. The iron popped, agreeing or protesting, who could tell.

By ten a.m. the sky had soured to a bruised green. Weather radio crackled about hail the size of cue balls and rain like Old Testament payback. Brother ladled coffee into chipped mugs for the night-shift boys: thick-necked, finger joints black with carbon. No one tipped. Tips were for towns with money.

The bell jangled. The trucker ducked under the frame. Same man, same table three, every trip downstate. Brother filled a mug and slid it over.

“Road’s spooked,” the trucker muttered, staring out the window. “Saw a camper upside down near Bellevue. Hail punched holes clean through the aluminum. Looked like Swiss cheese rolling in a ditch.”

Brother nodded, thinking of the freezer trailer roof: thirty feet of tin that might already be perforated by sky-ice. He flipped three eggs, busted one, cursed under his breath. Flora’s pencil scratched like a cricket trapped in a tin can.

“Storm’s different this time,” the trucker added. “Got a mean to it.”

At noon the meat order failed to arrive. Phone lines out. Cell towers blinking SOS. Flora’s face pinched as she surveyed a cooler that held twelve patties, a tub of lard, and onions soft as old thoughts.

“Vegetarian special,” she announced. “Toast and tears. Comes with a free weather forecast.”

Chuckles rippled through the tired men.

Brother fried onions until the dining room smelled like a county fair left in the sun too long. Donny wrote a line in his notebook, showed it to Brother: “The apocalypse smells like caramelized onions—who knew?” For once, Brother almost smiled.

Outside, daylight dimmed like someone throttled a lamp. The wind leapt, banging the dumpster lid against its chain. Rain followed, first thick drops, then sheets that blurred the parking lot into a gray mirage.

The fluorescents flickered once, twice. Went out. Exhaust fans died. The sudden quiet boomed.

Flora struck a match, lit the kerosene lamp that lived beneath the register. Its glow painted greasy halos on the chrome.

“Breaker box?” Donny offered.

Brother shook his head. “Water’s up past the wheels already. I step in that puddle, I’m catfish bait.”

“Then we work by lantern,” Flora said. “World’s been darker.”

A half hour later Brother pushed through the rain to check his trailer. Water lapped at the axles. The door gaped, hinge rust finally giving up. Inside, the mattress was soaked, blankets preparing to mold soon enough. No sense saving any of it; mold would do what ruin does, slow and thorough.

When he turned to leave, he saw movement on the far side: a skinny kid, drenched shirt glittering NIRVANA in washed-out rhinestones. Barefoot, blue lips, eyes wide as nickels. But something else too; the kid clutched a battered guitar case like it was the last solid thing in the world.

“You lost?” Brother barked over the roar.

The kid hugged himself, guitar case between his knees. “Just need a dry spot…”

“Bad pick,” Brother muttered, but motioned. “Food's inside.”

The boy followed, shivering so hard his teeth clicked. Inside, Flora pegged him with one glance.

“Another mouth,” she said.

“Another pair of hands,” Brother countered. “And looks like he plays.”

The deal was struck without more words. The kid, Jory, took the sink, scrubbing plates with the desperation of someone afraid to lose the job before he earned it. The guitar case sat by the kitchen door, with the water pooling beneath it.

Lightning ripped the sky. Thunder rattled the salt shakers. The trucker at table three lifted his mug, studied the boy.

“Kid’s safe?” he asked Brother.

“Safe enough,” Brother said, sliding a refill across.

The trucker laid two crumpled singles on the laminate and folded his massive hands. “Good. World’s mean enough without us adding to it.”

Rain deepened. Wind howled sharp and cutting. The diner windows flexed. Somewhere beyond the flood a horn blared, sheared off mid-scream.

Brother grabbed his jacket. “Something’s wrong out there.”

“Leave it,” Flora said.

He ignored her, waded into the night. Water climbed his shins. Fifty yards up the county road a sedan sat nose-down in a ditch, trunk pointing at Mars. Headlights illuminated nothing but churned mud. A woman pounded the window until her palms left bloody smears. A small form in the back seat didn’t move.

Through knee-deep water Brother slogged, wrenched the door. The woman screamed about her son. Brother cut the seatbelt with the serrated lid of a busted can, hauled the limp boy free. His own ribs howled from the effort.

They stumbled back toward the diner, child cradled like wet laundry. Flora met them at the threshold, lamp high. Donny swept condiments off booth five, laid down towels. Jory fetched a stack of paper napkins, useless but earnest.

The boy coughed a thin, torn sound. Breath staggered back into his chest. The woman sobbed, clutching him. Brother watched the child’s eyes flutter open, focus on nothing, then close again, alive but somewhere else.

Flora poured whiskey from under the till, splashed it on the woman’s scraped hands. She hissed, then gulped a shot straight from the bottle.

“Road’s gone,” she said in a flat voice.

Brother peeled off his jacket, draped it around the woman. She looked at him like she’d never seen kindness before and didn’t trust it now.

The lamp guttered. The kerosene was nearly gone. Donny’s flashlight died with a small electronic whimper.

Flora’s eyes flashed. “Generator in the shed.”

Brother and Donny slogged through black water. The Briggs & Stratton was a rust monument to bad maintenance. They heaved it onto a milk cart, dragged it through the mud like a dead bull.

Brother muttered a prayer to no god in particular. First pull: cough. Second: backfire. Third: engine roared, coughing smoke that stank of burning tractors.

Inside, lights blinked strobe-bright. The jukebox booted and, by electrical fate, chose Bobby Gentry’s “Ode to Billie Joe.” The acoustic twang seemed to mock them all.

“Turn that damn thing off,” Flora said, but nobody moved.

The diner became ark. Carnies from a jackknifed tilt-a-whirl truck squelched in, faces painted with streaks of neon where oil lamps had exploded. Two deputies sloshed by, radios dead. A crop duster pilot wandered, flight suit soaked, claiming he’d landed in a soybean field he couldn’t find anymore.

Flora set out the last of the bread, canned chili warmed on a Bunsen flame, pickles from an ancient barrel. People ate like penitents tasting sacrament.

Stories spilled: failed marriages, lost harvests, a carny who’d once juggled chainsaws on meth and woke up short a toe. But also: the deputy who’d delivered a baby in a parking lot, the pilot who’d flown medicine to flood victims, Donny reading a poem he’d written about his father’s hands. Even Jory, when pressed, admitted he’d been heading to Nashville when the storm caught him, pulled out his water-logged guitar and played three chords that still rang true.

Brother listened, said nothing. His story stayed locked behind his teeth.

The generator sputtered. Brother tapped the gas cap. Dry.

“Lantern back up,” he called. Jory struck a match, handed it over like a torch in a relay nobody wanted to win. Flame caught. Shadows grew teeth.

Then Jory slipped on fry grease, lantern flying. Glass burst; flames skittered across spilled lard under the range. People screamed. Brother tackled the mop bucket, drowned the fire in gray water and floating eggshells. Steam billowed, stink of burnt fat choking the room.

Silence after felt like the whole world glanced away, embarrassed.

Flora wiped her face with a dish rag, left a black smear. “Anybody else got excitement, speak now.”

Nobody spoke.

Rain tapered toward dawn. Clouds thinned to charcoal streaks. Through the smeared glass, Brother saw the horizon glow, the sick yellow of light after too much water.

Inside, bodies slumped. Carnies leaned on farmers, deputies on the counter, the pilot flat out on booth cushions. The boy slept across two chairs, breathing easy. The woman held his hand in a grip that looked permanent.

Flora counted heads. “Thirty-four souls,” she whispered. “Never had a church, but this’ll do.”

Brother walked to the window. The neon outside flickered—O P E, the N still dead. But dawn behind it made the dark glass shine, and for one breath it read HOPE after all.

Brother barked a laugh, the sound as dry as gravel under tires. He rubbed the sideways Y on his knuckle, turned back to the grill.

Outside, the water had begun to recede, leaving a brown line on everything like a high-water mark on a measuring cup. His trailer sat cockeyed, door still gaping. Everything he owned was ruined. But through the kitchen window, he could see Jory’s guitar case, and beyond that, Flora counting heads again, making sure she hadn’t lost anyone in the night.

One of the deputies had waded to his cruiser, returned with a cooler from his trunk: eggs from his wife's chickens, bacon he'd been taking to his mother. ""Figured we'd need breakfast,"" he'd said, setting it by the kitchen door.

“Yeah, breakfast crowd’ll be here soon,” he said.

Flora nodded, struck another match. “Gas on, Hollywood.”

He fired the iron. Eggs cracked, bacon spit. The smell rose like promise beat half to death but still breathing.

The woman from the car appeared in front of him, her boy awake now, wrapped in someone’s flannel shirt. “Thank you,” she said simply.

Brother nodded, flipped an egg. “Coffee’s fresh.”

My social circle has shrunk over the years — I have a few school friends, but everyone’s tied up with work, family, and their own lives. Most of my time goes into work and family too. Since both my current and previous jobs were remote, I’ve lost touch with colleagues as well.

Lately, I’ve really started missing the casual hangouts, conversations, and the sense of connection that used to come from friendships and daily interactions. But making new friends at this age feels… tricky.

I’m deep into my 2025 release schedule and wanted to share what I’m building across formats — especially for anyone into narrative-driven work, experimental media, or collaborative worldbuilding.

# ✍️ Fiction Projects – Weird, Raw, and Reflective

My writing this year is divided into **three major novels**, each in the late editing or pre-publishing stage:

* **“Destined for Perfection”** – A near-future tragicomedy about obsession, control, and manufactured success. The tone is part *Black Mirror*, part Vonnegut.
* **“Pixels Vs Symbols”** – A metafictional digital SciFi combining entrepreneurship in tech/video entertainment via pure force of will, leading to poverty inspired philosophy and scientific inventions as extension of the enterprise - mixed with drug abuse think *Slumdog Millionaire and The Fisher King* meet *Cartoon College* by Tara Wray.
* **“No Plastic Smiles”** – A cult drama set inside a anti-'superhero n​ovel' a decaying city throughout epic scale of time, and over the course of a series of battles between not-good guys and not-bad guys, full of unreliable narrators and creepy sincerity. Psychological, anti-utopianism, and full of grime. And there are the council of the God's, or what's left of them after all the worshippers got killed - except one who left.

I’m also working on a **memoir novel**, *Questions: So Far* and a **memoir theatre style screenplay -** the novel ​is ​chronicling my 30-year arc through psychedelia, dissociation, and the media rabbit hole. It’s a hybrid of personal narrative, literary reflection, and experimental autofiction. The script is a theatrical psychic warp through cities as characters and life as lived-in poetry.

# 🕹️ Game Dev – Narrative Systems and Retro Engines

I’m using **RPG Maker XP** and **GameMaker** to develop small, story-focused experiences designed for Patreon + Itch ​drops.

* **RPG Project:** *Story of the Feldlings* – A TTRPG-inspired folklore world with posthuman goblins, eco*​*\-freaks, and bio-rituals. This will launch as both a playable demo, a decent-length origin story and a original but not-too-lengthy rulebook.
* **GameMaker Projects:** A couple in the pipeline, mostly experimental pixel adventures with surreal dialogue trees and lo-fi horror. I'm studying one tutorial per day and creating a shared asset library for remix use.
* Machinima - a story about post-college grunge-garage startups rather desperate, and a bit silly. Using RPG Maker XP. And screen capture.​

Everything is CC BY or community-friendly where possible. My goal is to blur the line between game, fiction, and playable art objects.

# 📚 Zines and Digital Theatre

This year’s first big zine drop is **“NerdCulture: Coffee and Conversations”**, a mix of alt-culture reviews, interviews, essays, and personal commentary. Think: late-2000s blog energy meets punk print.

Coming up:

* **“Focus Thought Revolution”** – Philosophy meets media weirdness. Bite-sized essays with collage art, minimal layout, and occasional fiction + ​comic snippets.
* **“Potato Zine”** – A behind-the-scenes making-of for my first-ever gonzo student film *The Giant Satanic Potato and the Killer Apes from Hell*, told as a mockumentary-style memoir zine. Featuring crew monologues, raw stills, and punked-out lore dumps.

I’m building toward **interactive dioramas** and **digital theatre experiences** too — combining Moho animation, audio drama, and visual novels into browser-based experiments.

# 💡 Genres, Style, and Mediums

* **Genres:** Global post-modern slice of life grimdark in suburbia and urbia with hyperreal terminally introverted characters. Different kinds of body horror. Psychological horror, dark comedy, cyberpunk, mythpunk, metafiction, and bizarre autofiction.
* **Mediums:** Novels, short fiction, experimental ​video (transmissions via private discord), machinima, theatre, ​zines, TTRPGs + CCG rulebooks, visual art, audio plays, low-res games, comics, graphic novel TPBs.
* **Products:** Digital bundles (Patreon + Gumroad), CC remix kits, and hybrid books/game-worlds.

If you’re into open-ended worlds, glitch aesthetics, weird audio, meta-narratives, and raw truth-telling — I’m building a space for that.

I’d love to meet other creators working in multiple mediums or playing with genre-bending formats. Drop your work below or hit me up if you want to swap zines, collab, or nerd out about strange fiction/game crossovers. Cheers!

We are approaching summer pretty quickly here, and I've seen quite a few posts about athletes experiencing the effects of the heat/ humidity, and how they can ""improve"", or ""manage"" this time in most of the running subs. Note- this is for the athletes who do *not* do heat specific training in the off-season (I can do a separate post on that if anybody is interested).

As a disclaimer, I am a very small-time running coach. I primarily coach newcomers to the running/ ultrarunning world, and also have a couple athletes who are advanced. I also possess exactly zero education besides various UESCA certs, so please take everything I say with a grain of salt and DYOR. I am simply someone who made just about *every single mistake* one can make as a newcomer to the sport. I've had some awful coaches who were giving me incorrect info, and now have also lucked out with one of the best coaches (IMO) in existence (I'm bias, lol). I just want to pass along information to the Reddit community that I employ with the <15 athletes I work with (although a few don't bother, which is fine!). This information should be used by folks who are figuring this stuff out and are on the less-experienced side. There could be something in here for the more experienced athletes as well. Just trying to help the community.

The good news? You *can* run in the heat. The bad news? It takes time to adapt and, quite frankly, takes time to do so. Oh, and it sucks, lol. I think simply approaching this time of year knowing it's going to suck for the first little while is one of the most helpful ways to tolerate the transition.

General guidelines:

* Hydrate before, during and after the run.
* Pre-cool right before the run: dunk your shirt, shorts, hat in ice cold water and rock those proudly. I personally just do my shirt due to chaffing down below. 
* Get your run in either early in the morning, or late evening to avoid the hottest periods of the day. 
* Decrease your effort *dramatically* (10-20% ish slower pace/ effort than what you'd usually do, maybe more).
* Run during the hottest times of the day, every other day or so. I only recommend doing this after about 7-10 days of the athlete exercising within the parameters listed above. Or it could be sooner. Or longer. Depends on the athlete's physiology. Don't compare yourself to others in this situation. Just approach this period with grace. Everybody is different, but some rough guidelines do help.

So, with all that being said, I think it's *extremely* helpful to also do a 1hr liquid loss test. You'll often see these on various websites as ""sweat tests"" but those don't account for sodium/ potassium loss. You need to either do that in a lab, or with something like a Nix Biosensor. Anyways, I encourage folks to do this basically as soon as they are feeling adapted or acclimated to the heat, and do them every month or so. Reason being, that first adaptation period, you'll most likely not sweat as much or efficiently so the data will be a little off from the tests, but YMMV.

I first suggest doing the test below, at or below your AeT (top end of your easy effort/ pace) for a baseline on all of your easy runs. You can also get more specific and utilize them for different efforts above your AeT. I have a spreadsheet I can share with you all if anybody is interested, just shoot me a message. You basically weigh yourself before and after the run, and don't consume any fluids during (and try not to urinate during the effort). Also keep track of the average temperature during the run so that you know how much you sweat at different temps.

Now, I didn't touch on electrolyte consumption as it's very individual, but if you're not taking in enough during the run, you'll experience some nasty symptoms both during and after such as:

* Twitching/ cramping
* Headache/ nausea
* High RPE
* Fatigue/ weakness
* Dizziness/ lightheadedness
* Excessive thirst
* Feelings of being ""hungover"" after the run (this one sucks big time)
* Delayed recovery
* Loss of muscle control/ coordination
* Bloating

This is where you can play around with the amount of sodium per hour if you're feeling any of the above. I've anecdotally seen athletes needing more than they think (🙋) but it can be an absolute game changer if you start to nail this one down. A few years ago, I was chronically under-consuming electrolytes, and once I got this dialed in, it led to a major breakthrough. If you're experiencing only a few of the symptoms listed above, perhaps start on the lower side, 400-600mg per hour. If you're experiencing a lot of them, aim higher. I personally aim for 1200mg of sodium per hour *at a minimum* on my runs. This takes some trial and error, so prepare yourself for that.

I hope this is helpful to the community. Please feel free to provide counter arguments/ points on anything I've addressed. Mods, feel free to remove this too if it doesn't fit within the guides. Hopefully I drank enough coffee this morning so that this makes sense 😂.

Perhaps the mods will find this worthy of being stickied.

Much of the advice that you can find from Google has limitations. They are often simplified and as you can tell from the length of this post, the legal landscape can be pretty technical and complicated. Sites like [Gov.uk](http://Gov.uk) also conflate the legal position and road safety advice. The road safety advice often gives broad generalisations that for most people are pretty reasonable, but aren’t all that helpful when people have specific circumstances for which they want to be able to apply the law. This can lead to confusion of what the legal position is and also leaves no space for nuance.

Some of this might get pretty technical, but this is a reflection of the legislation; I've tried to keep it simple but not oversimplify. I have included case law citations where appropriate. I am only going to reference legislation and case law as this is the primary source of truth. I am a currently servicing Roads Policing Officer in England and this advice is only focused on the law in England and Wales. The law in Scotland and Northern Ireland may vary from this.

# Vehicle control offences

First off, I’m going to talk about three other related offences before I address the mobile phone legislation directly.

**Not being in proper control/Not in a position to have full view**

[Regulation 104 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/104) creates an offence of the driver of a motor vehicle not being in a position to have proper control of the vehicle or a full view of the road and traffic ahead. This offence is usually dealt with by a fixed penalty of 3 points and £100 fine, going to court may result in a different penalty.

This regulation creates two separate offences:

1)     Not being in proper control

2)     Not in a position to have full view

**Not being in proper control**

This is where you are in a situation where you don’t have full control over the speed and direction of the vehicle. This could be because you have something in your hands, a cup of coffee or sandwich for example.

An example of where I have given a ticket for this is where I’ve seen someone in traffic moving their car forward with both hands behind their head. At that point in time, they did not have control over the direction of the vehicle and whilst the speeds are slower, they are not in a position to have proper control of the vehicle.

In a mobile phone context, this could mean that you have a mobile phone in your hand which is completely turned off which prevents you from having control of the steering or gears in the vehicle. This could constitute an offence of not being in proper control.

**Not in a position to have full view**

This is where you are in a situation where you are in such a position that you could not have full view of the road and traffic ahead. This is relevant to mobile phones because some people have mobile phone mounts where they attach them to the windscreen in such a way where it obscures their view of the road ahead. This is often relevant to taxi drivers or delivery drivers who may mount more than one device to their windscreen. Whether is the mounting would meet the level required to prevent the driver having a full view is dependent on the facts and is somewhat subjective. Ultimately a court will decide if this is the case.

**Driving without due care and attention**

[Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/3) creates offences of driving without due care and attention and driving without reasonable consideration on a road or public place. I will only focus on driving without dure care and attention for the purposes of keeping this scoped to mobile phone use. This offence is usually dealt with by a fixed penalty of 3 points and £100 fine, going to court may result in a different penalty.

A defendant will have driven 'without due care and attention' if his driving has departed from the standard of care and skill that would, in the circumstances of the case, have been exercised by a reasonable, prudent and competent driver. The standard is the same in the case of a driver who is a learner holding a provisional licence as it is in the case of the holder of a full driving licence.

This offence will often be evidenced by the standard of driving. The level of attention required can also change based on the situation. You need to give a higher level of attention driving at say 40mph on a dual carriageway where there may be cyclists and other hazards than being stationary in heavy traffic. For example, if you’re in stationary traffic and are changing the radio station whereby you haven’t seen that the traffic has moved on and you’re now holding up traffic behind you, the required level of attention to the road has not been met. However, people’s abilities to multi-task are not the same. Some people may be able to change the route on cradled phone used as a satnav whilst in stationary traffic so that they are giving the necessary level of attention to other traffic where other people may not be. As a driver, you should be aware and self-reflective to ensure that you are always able to give the necessary attention to driving. Ultimately, it’s down to a court to decide if the facts of the situation prove your actions are at the level of a reasonable, prudent and competent driver.

Due care can also be evidenced by externally observing the standard of driving. When you’re pressing a button on the satnav, or in-car entertainment system, do you swerve in the carriageway, unnecessarily brake or slow down? These may be indicators that you are not driving with the necessary due care and attention. If at any point your car mounts the pavement, even momentarily \[DPP v Smith \[2002\] EWHC 1151 (Admin)\], this is very likely to be driving without due care and attention \[Watts v Carter 1959\].

So, before we’ve even looked at the specific mobile phone legislation, we can see that there are uses of mobile phones whilst driving that can be dealt with using other offences. Therefore, you must always drive whilst being in a position to have proper control of the vehicle, be in a position to have a full view of the road and traffic ahead and drive with due consideration and care for other road users.

# Using a mobile phone whilst driving

[Regulation 110 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/110) creates a prohibition on the use of mobile telephones in motor vehicles **in certain circumstances**. I’ll talk about the exceptions to this rule towards the end. This offence is usually dealt with by a fixed penalty of 6 points and £200 fine, going to court may result in a different penalty.

We’ll start by understanding the different elements of the offence in a bit more detail. If any of these points don’t apply, the offence isn’t complete and you can’t be prosecuted for this offence.

·        Driving

·        A motor vehicle

·        On a road

·        Using

·        A hand-held mobile phone or other hand-held device

**What is ‘driving’?**

This is also a surprisingly technical topic due to all the case law surrounding it. Generally, to be driving you need to have control of the direction **and** speed of the vehicle **and** for it to fall within the common dictionary definition of the word \[R v MacDonagh \[1974\] RTR 372\]. Beyond this legal test, it gets really complicated really quickly.

My advice is that generally you are not driving if the ignition is not on, and for EVs if your car is in such a state that pressing the accelerator does not lead to the vehicle moving forward. There are situations where the above may be the case and you may still be found to be driving by a court. Like I said, this gets very complicated.

**What is a ‘motor vehicle’?**

This can get very technical depending on the facts, so I’ll try and keep this short. A motor vehicle is a type of ‘mechanically propelled vehicle’ (MPV) intended or adapted for use on a road. A MPV is a vehicle which uses Gas, Oil, Petrol, Electricity, Diesel or Steam to propel it \[Floyd v Bush (1953)\]. In common understanding, all cars, lorries, buses etc will be motor vehicles, but it also includes other vehicles such as electric scooters.

**What is a ‘road’?**

Again, this gets really complicated when your look at the case law, but the definition is often cited as any (length of) highway and any other road to which the public has access, and includes bridges over which a road passes which is defined in [section 192(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/192). To keep this simple, lets talk about what is and isn’t a road through examples.

*Public Car Parks and Parking Bays*

These can be roads, but the actual parking spaces aren’t \[Cutter v Eagle Star 1998\]. In the simplest terms, a road is a 'way' for the passage of vehicles (of course other traffic may use a road but that is not the issue here). It must be possible to identify that way, and, in a multi storey car park, there are conventional signs clearly defining a route vehicles must take, thus making it a road. However, the Court stated that the parking bays were NOT part of that road.

*Driveways*

Private driveways are generally not roads as they are not publicly accessible, however, if you’re fortunate to be on a large estate, these can be roads \[Adams v Metropolitan Police \[1980\] RTR 289\].

*On Road Parking*

As the title suggests, in my opinion this would likely be judged to be part of the road, but there is an absence of specific case law on this.

*Private Roads*

This really depends on the facts, so could go one way or the other, but generally these have some public access so may be found to be a road. A private caravan park roadway set out like a road and with public pedestrian access along it is a road \[Barrett v DPP \[2009\] EWHC 423 (Admin)\].

**What is ‘using’?**

Regulation 110(6) of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 gives a non-exhaustive list of what ‘using’ includes:

(i) illuminating the screen;

(ii) checking the time;

(iii) checking notifications;

(iv) unlocking the device;

(v) making, receiving, or rejecting a telephone or internet based call;

(vi) sending, receiving or uploading oral or written content;

(vii) sending, receiving or uploading a photo or video;

(viii) utilising camera, video, or sound recording functionality;

(ix) drafting any text;

(x) accessing any stored data such as documents, books, audio files, photos, videos, films, playlists, notes or messages;

(xi) accessing an application;

(xii) accessing the internet.

**What is a ‘hand-held mobile telephone’?**

Regulation 110(6) of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 states that a mobile telephone or other device is to be treated as hand-held if it is, or must be, held at some point while being used. That means it must be held in the hand for it to come under this offence. Interacting with a mobile phone in a cradle is not an offence under Regulation 110 as long as you don’t have it held in the hand during its use.

**What is a ‘another hand-held device?**

This hand-held device is defined as a device, other than a two-way radio, which is capable of transmitting and receiving data, whether or not those capabilities are enabled.

This opens the door for lots of devices that aren’t mobile phones. For example, if you don’t have your smart watch on your wrist and pick that up to interact with it. This could also include lots of internet of things (IoT) or smart devices. Another example is that there are vapes that can connect to your phone. Using one of these whilst driving would be a mobile phone offence even if you’ve never connected it to your phone. Any device must still be hand-held for it to fall under this definition.

**Supervising Learners**

Regulation 110(3) makes this application to the supervision of learner drivers, so having a hand-held call whilst you are supervising a provisional licence holder is an offence.

**Exceptions**

There are some exceptions stated in Regulation 110 that are relevant to the general public:

*Calling Emergency Services*

Regulation 110(5) A person does not contravene a provision of this regulation if, at the time of the alleged contravention - he is using the telephone or other device to call the police, fire, ambulance or other emergency service on 112 or 999; he is acting in response to a genuine emergency; and it is unsafe or impracticable for him to cease driving in order to make the call.

*Contactless Payments*

Regulation 110(5B) - provides that a person is not in contravention of the regulation where at the time of the alleged contravention they are using their mobile phone or other device to make a contactless payment, for goods/services that are received at the same time as or after the contactless payment is made and the motor vehicle is stationary. 

# FAQ & Common Misunderstandings

*Can I use a mobile phone whilst it is in a cradle?*

You can do any\* activity on a mobile phone whilst it’s in a cradle and not hand-held as long as you drive with due care and attention, are in proper control of the vehicle and do not have an obscured view.

\* It is unclear whether a mobile phone meets the definition of ""other cinematographic apparatus"" as defined in [regulation 109 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/109), and therefore if watching youtube on your phone is an offence even if it does not distract the driver (which in most cases it would). There is no case law and I've heard persuaive arguments on both sides. I'm unsure enough that I would not issue a ticket under regulation 109 and would instead look at a s3 RTA due care offence instead.

*Should I turn my phone off and put in the glove box?*

If you find it hard not to use your phone when driving or find it a distraction, this might be a useful preventative measure. However, there is a downside to this. If you need to call the emergency services this may hinder you in making an appropriate and necessary call. As a driver you need to work out whether your self-control requires you to turn it off or not, the focus should be on you driving safely and competently at all times.

*If I use an app to park my car remotely, am I driving?*

Yes. There is an exemption in the legislation to allow for this, but you do fit the definition of driving.

*Is it illegal to use a mobile phone whilst using a mobility scooter? It seems to fit the definition.*

Mobility scooters are exempted by [Section 20 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1970/44/section/20), therefore this would not be an offence.

*If I’m using my phone on an electric scooter, could I be prosecuted for using a mobile phone?*

Even if the scooter is insured and registered within the trial areas around the UK, this would firt the definition of a mobile phone offence.

*I’m a newly qualified driver and this offence happened in the first two years after I passed my test. Will I lose my licence?*

If the offence date is after you passed your test and not longer than 2 years after this, then yes, you are likely to go back to learner status post-conviction.

*Should I pull over if I need to change the navigation settings on my GPS?*

That depends on the individual. You must drive with due care and attention and be in proper control of the vehicle at all times, but as long as the device isn’t hand-held, some people can do this whilst driving, some people can’t and some people want to play it safe. These are all reasonable and legal approaches.

He's someone that loved to travel, and literally reviewed every single thing he could find (shoutout to the 'Welcome to Texas' highway sign).

I'm hoping to make a coffee table book or something of the sorts with all his reviews, as a lot of them are pretty funny and I'd love to have something to share with my kids and have them know who their grandpa was a bit more.

I can see his profile, all his reviews and photos (he was a local guide level 10!), but seems the only way I can pull these is manually. While businesses have some connectors to scrape all of them, I can't seem to do that for a single person.

If anyone here knows of a potential route, any guidance would be appreciated!",3,1749390126.0,googleReviews,0,1.0,False

Since we got married my wife has had outburst, anytime she is overstimulated, called out or has so do something she dosent want to do she lashes out.  She was not like this before marriage but it started pretty much right after.  I am getting to the point now I can't handle it anymore.  I'm posting here because I have no one to talk to in fear of them judging my relationship or hating my wife for it.  I wanted to talk about this morning and how I should respond, as I said we have one son who is the center of my world he always wants to be with me and I do 90% of the childcare.  It's to the point I haven't done anything alone in a year other then work because my wife guilt trips me anytime I want to do anything.  Anyways this morning I am going to work at 6am I usually let our dogs out it was thunderstorming so I did not knowing when wet they get hyper will wake up my son and jump in our bed soaking wet.  I text my wife as she's asleep I did not let them out.  My wife wakes up and begins blowing up on me for not letting the dogs out because now she has to let the dogs out and make our son breakfast (we have a fenced in yard).  I began telling her why I did not she tells me my exscuses mean nothing, then she goes to our sons laundry did not get switched.  She put it in the washer last night while I was giving our son a bath without me knowing and is telling me I'm a bad husband and a child because I did nothing to help her today. Flash back to the weekend she slept in all weekend our son wakes up at 6 she woke up at 10 I let it go because she just got fired from her job this is her 4th job since our son was born.  I let the dogs out made breakfast cleaned the kitchen and did all of our laundry.  When she woke up I had her breakfast and coffee on the table and she said you were being too loud and looked at her food and said I don't want a muffin and set it on the bare counter.  I cleaned it up.  Now she is texting me and I am not texting her back because of her rage she is saying things like she is moving upstairs and I will never be the person I claim to be and that she can do it all on her own.  I have never once said that she couldn't... I just don't know what to do anymore I love my son and don't want to only be there half of his life and also I don't like leaving him with her because of the way she acts.

tl;dr I don't know what to do with my wife she's a new person every day she wakes up and it's wearing on me. ",1,1749389999.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

I feel so at peace. I was a little chilly so I went inside and got a sweater. 
Guys, Nobody got yelled at. Nobody got screamed at for opening and closing the door or coming inside too many times. Nobody got called an idiot or slow in the head for not understanding something the first time. And everyone walked away feeling good and it just feels so good. 😊

1l6ccuk,https://i.redd.it/s4xy3pv8ip5f1.jpeg,Help Spread the Word | Creative Outreach Needed for No Kings Day Protest – June 14,"The No Kings Day protest is happening this Saturday, June 14—and now’s the time to go all out on spreading the word.

We know people don’t just show up because of one post or flyer. They show up because someone invited them. That’s where all of us come in!

Organizers have pulled together a ton of creative ideas for helping boost turnout. Pick one or two—or come up with your own—and help get this on everyone’s radar:

	•	Social media blitz: Post a few times this week on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or X. Try short videos, countdown graphics, or personal “why I’m going” posts.
	•	Text & email chains: Message your protest crew from last year. Drop the Mobilize link into your group chats. Add it to your email signature for the week.
	•	Word of mouth: Talk it up at the library, school pickup, your local coffee shop, or Pride. Ask a few people to come—and bring someone with them.
	•	Flyers and signs: Hang flyers in laundromats, cafés, or on light poles. Chalk the sidewalk. Add a sign to your car window or yard.
	•	Make it fun: Host a sign-making night. Paint rocks with the date and drop them in parks. Do a visibility banner drop during rush hour. Anything that gets people curious or talking helps.

The protest is going to be powerful—but it’s only as big as we make it. This is the week to make it visible and loud.

We arrived there around 2:30pm or so. Tired from the trip there, but didn't want to miss out on anything and went there straight with no break at hotel. First thing we encountered was the wooden ring, and now I understand why everyone keeps praising it. It's MASSIVE, if you see a picture, it doesn't sink in how massive it is. 

So we arrived and looking around a bit, and became disheartened when we saw the lines. Although they were lines to USA, France, China, so I guess the most popular ones, but each was \~2 hours. And it's not a wait-while-being-entertained kind of line as in Disneyland, but just a line on concrete with not much to do, so we decided against joining one of those.

At this point we realized that our only pre-booked thing was starting 4pm and it was on the other side. So we semi-rushed to go there: ""Future City"". Managed to just get there in time, but it was just huge video screens showing some ambiguous statements, only cool-ish part was 1:1 models of two different upcoming robots and some concept of a future public transportation interior. Don't bother with this pavilion.

Entered Kura Sushi conveyor sushi restaurant. This was the best part. They had all kinds of international dishes on the menu, not only their usual sushi. I ordered Chinese mooncake and Guatemalan coffee jelly. Both were excellent, and tried many other dishes at well. Highly recommended. 

At this point running around exhausted I had completely forgotten that there is an app I could have used to sign up for a same-day reservation. So we missed out on seeing any country pavilion at all, as once we walked back to the other side taking a route that would take us past the pavilions we hadn't yet seen (from the outside), it was already \~6pm and wanted to rest. The central park thing was a nice point to feel a bit refreshed in the middle.

Got back to the hotel and fell asleep on the bed in about 5 minutes.

Why is it tiring? Because walking, so many people, being in transit to get there etc., it would have been better to have been there already the day before and getting a good night's rest before, and not attempt to heroically go in right after a lot of travel. 

We actually had tickets for the next day too. But felt so burned out from the first day that we just didn't go (could luckily change them to another day at least in the app) back. It was nice to see what it was about, but I just wish I hadn't completely forgotten about the same-day reservation option! 

I wonder if we are one of the few people who managed to not see a single country pavilion at the expo.

1l6cbxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1l6cbxt/hows_the_weather_out/,How's The Weather Out?,"Sunday… again, like a blistering warning tone from the national weather service, ushering in the familiar heart pounding anxiety that millions experience. Yet what lies beneath is more like a tale of two cities, the best of times, and the worst of times. The dread of two distinctly different storm systems, each with their own patterns of formation, intensity, and path of destruction.

For those fortunate enough to be employed, Sunday night anxiety presents as a predictable tropical depression; uncomfortable, contained, following a clear path, a timeline, and minimal impact at best. Like residents all along the east coast they've weathered this caution many times before, they mentally stock their emotional pantry, gas up the car, and make sure the flashlight has batteries as the weekend draws to a close. Monday morning arrives, and somewhere after that first cup of coffee, and initial screening of emails a calm blows through and the storm is downgraded to a passing shower, with a beautiful surprise; the promise of a Friday rainbow. As Monday morning anxiety dissipates into Tuesday routine, it’s back to the wildfires that are par for the course.

By contrast, the unemployed experience a traumatic tumultuous Saffir-Simpson class 5 storm weekly. Similar to living in tornado alley where multiple storm storms converge without warning and little if any time to prepare. The anxiety doesn't follow a neat weekly pattern, the unpredictable nature of devastating economic conditions ready to wreak havoc and unleash a furious swath of destruction on hopes, dreams, finances, and self-worth. The unemployed face ""omni-directional anxiety"" constantly scanning the horizon with spyglasses (Social Media Referrals), Doppler radar (Job Boards and AI scrappers),  for opportunities while bracing for the inevitable **cruelty of silence**, and the devastating destruction that awaits in their inbox. The flood stick measuring the height of the flood waters of rejection emails.

From Friday night through Monday evening, a perfect storm that even Alaskan Crab Fishermen would be fearful of churns and torments the lives of the unemployed. While many wind down for the weekend, the unemployed are uncontrollably secreting cortisol, norepinephrine, and actively attempt to think of anything but money, while their self-worth reaches challenger deep levels of which even the Titanic has never seen. Why you ask, because the never-ending search goes into an uncontrollable panicked mode of a forced pause, creating an eerie dread that feels like  thick quiet air hanging overhead before a deafening crack of thunder rocks the sky with a raucous and frightening tone rivaling “the big bang” that unsettles all aspects of life. Saturday brings the false hope of productivity, the vicious cycle of updating multiple resumes, researching companies, networking as best you can, but let’s be honest, who is online? By Sunday night, the reality sets in that another week of potential opportunities has passed without a breakthrough. Monday morning delivers its own cruel twist of fate. While many experience relief as their predictable storm passes, we unemployed face an additional seismic event somewhere around a 4.5 on the Richter scale. Premature earthquake survivors waiting for aftershocks, knowing that Monday will be largely barren of new opportunities, as Tuesday is when a majority of recruiters post. After enduring the weekend not just the Sunday night dread but also Monday's empty promise, Tuesday brings new hope.

The rainbows that appear on weekends, moments of joy, vacation planning, or small workplace victories that make Monday's return bearable for some, are tortuous reminders of days gone by for others. The tragedy and beauty of human resilience lies in how both groups continue to search the sky for different versions of happiness, even as they endure vastly different meteorological realities.",0,1749389800.0,recruitinghell,1,0.5,False

Most coins out there are noise: flashy names, big promises, no follow‑through. That’s not investing. That’s gambling, and gambling is a fast track to losing it all.

But every now and then, something different surfaces.

Kendu isn’t just another meme token. It’s evolving into a real **brand**, with **actual traction:** the result of a community that chooses to **build**, not just hype. Call it a permissionless brand empire or community as a service. Either way, it's **working**.

# ✅ Execution Matters

Ideas are common; execution is rare. Kendu has been steadily delivering on multiple fronts:

* **CertiK audit completed December 31, 2024**, earning an A (≈84 Skynet score), with zero critical issues and all major issues acknowledged/resolved ([staging.skynet.certik.com](https://staging.skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu/security-score?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [skynet.certik.com](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Community votes surpassed 50,000: only the second token ever to qualify for a free CertiK audit, narrowly behind PEPE ([kenduinu.com](https://www.kenduinu.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Successful Community Takeover in January, and only up since dumping a toxic dev.

Also active across big chains: Ethereum, Solana, Base ([kenduinu.com](https://www.kenduinu.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

# 🧮 Market Performance & Metrics

* **Price**: ≈ $0.0000233 (down \~4% in past 24 h, −9–10% week)
* **Market Cap**: Between **$22M–$24M**, ranking around #1,000–1,100 ([staging.skynet.certik.com](https://staging.skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu/security-score?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **24h Volume**: About $50–$55K ([coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Circulating Supply**: \~948–992 billion; FDV \~99–100% of market cap

Volume-to-market-cap ratio remains low, signaling quiet consolidation. Some sources report a recent 14% spike ([coinstats.app](https://coinstats.app/coins/kendu-inu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

# 🌱 Community & Brand Signal

* Strong grassroots presence threads, Reddit, TikTok, Threads, Instagram, Stocktwits organic, volunteer-driven
* Reddit users underscore this ethos:“Kendu separates itself through its real‑world presence… propelled forward by an incredibly passionate community with a ‘Can‑do’... attitude.” ([staging.skynet.certik.com](https://staging.skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu/security-score?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))“I love the positivity of the $Kendu community.” ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Active across products: real-world hot dogs, coffee, board games, merchandise, animation, and upcoming video games multiple community squads building diverse verticals.

# 🌐 You Can See It, Touch It, Use It

Unlike most tokens, Kendu delivers tangible products: food, drink, apparel, games, collectibles. It feels like an early‑stage **lifestyle brand**, yet remains fully **decentralized**.

# 👥 Why Community Is the Backbone

All big story tokens start with community. But Kendu’s difference lies in community that **does things**: builds, hosts events, launches products, boosts visibility.

The CertiK audit vote and the resulting A score weren't random; they resulted from organized community action, rallying behind something more than speculative value.

# 🚀 Final Thought: Still Early, Already Building

At \~$23M market cap, Kendu remains a small project. Yet it's already outpacing many 10× larger coins: **real products**, **active community**, a **solid, non‑hype roadmap**.

Most tokens come and go. Kendu is quietly becoming a **cultural brand**, powered bottom‑up by people committed to building.

**It’s not just a token. It’s a movement.**

Reports say he installed hidden cameras in the shop bathroom disguised as items like throat lozenge boxes and razors. Even during employee trips, he allegedly filmed staff while they were showering. Videos were saved on shared devices and his personal computer, often categorized by the female employees’ names.

He was arrested on June 5 and later released on bail (80,000 TWD). Both cafes remain open.

This has understandably sparked major public anger and concern around privacy and safety in public spaces.

This is my first time leaving a bad review and while I want to feel bad for how strongly worded it is, they were trying to take 57$ from me.

Maybe it’s a little screwed up but I do feel more joy when I drain my money back out from a malicious seller in comparison to actually receiving the item I want. So that’s a plus, guess you can’t get you’re 10 Starbucks coffees girly💔

This time around to be fair the person I bought from had no previous listings so I knew this was a shot in the dark (just was hoping it was an actual new seller)

I know you must get a lot of these posts, but I’m flying into Vietnam tonight for a week-long trip and would love a bit of help planning things out!

I’m a 25M, traveling solo, and haven’t done much research (classic last-minute move). I’m hoping to explore a mix of culture, good food, and maybe unwind with a nice massage or two. Open to any recommendations — local eats, hidden gems, or must-see spots.

Also, is the scam situation really that bad? I’ve seen a lot of posts warning about scams and chaotic road crossings — would love to know what’s real vs. overhyped.

Appreciate any tips — and if anyone’s around and up for sharing a coffee or a street food stop, I’m always happy to meet new people 🙌🏻",3,1749389371.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

Let's break it down so we can understand what's really happening. So you pick up your phone, open your Short/Reel/Tiktok feed and start scrolling up, then time skips and you really don't notice you've spend 2 hours of your time mindlessly scrolling. 

Now the reason why it's so addictive is it invoke certain emotions, and emotions dictates our attention and focus mechanisms by nature, So when you scroll you think you're scrolling through videos but what you're scrolling through is emotions... you watch a video that makes you happy, then you scroll up and watch something that makes you really sad, then you're next scroll is being hit with gory clip of someone being crushed by a car (just an example) and it's all random.

So think about it for a second, You're pulling a lever to get a random video on these apps, to make yourself feel a random emotion and it's making you emotionally unstable, we humans are not built to feel a different emotion every 5 second, some would argue that these apps are slot machines designed to robe you of your time.

and it's starting manifest in society in a very odd weird way, you walk outside and go near to any coffee shop you start seeing people glued to their smartphones scrolling up and down watching meaningless 30 sec clips, even the elderly are doing it and it's sickening...

I wake up everyday and check sociel media, and it's a literal mental asylum, the best thing you can do in 2025 is throw your smartphones in the garbage. get the hell out and go to the nearest beach, and plunge in the water to remind yourself of whats real.

1l6c5bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/1l6c5bi/have_i_accidentally_joined_a_cult_help_would_be/,Have I accidentally joined a cult? Help would be appreciated,"Throwaway account,

I (20F) think I may have accidentally joined a religious cult but I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking. 

So yesterday I was sat in a park eating my lunch alone and this woman not much older than me came up to me and asks if she could talk about God. I felt like I couldnt say no and did tell her I wasnt religious anymore but she stood next to me explaining the trauma in her life, how she used to smoke weed, losing a child etc. She says how God saved her as the holy spirit appeared in front of her one day. I said I could relate somewhat to what she was saying. After some discussion she asks if she could pray with me (Ive not practiced in years so it felt a little weird) and gave me her bible. After this, she invited me to service and my personal life is pretty bad right now and felt like i needed some guidance. At this point, the alarm bells werent going off yet and it felt like it was a sign but maybe it was just the way she was preaching to me? She gave me her number and when/where the service was and how excited she was to see me. When she left, she was crying out of happiness that I'd agreed to come.

This morning, I went to the service. It was in a hotel basement which I did think was odd but when I entered there was maybe less than 20 people so I just assumed it was underfunded or something. It started off with gospel singing but it was more rock-y and the choir were jumping up and down, dancing that sort of thing. There were led lights and a makeshift 'DJ'. It was really different compared to my protestant church growing up. The service starts and the pastor was talking about a few scriptures nothing out of the ordinary but I noticed throughout that a few of the churchgoers kept crying and speaking their own prayers. Especially during the other gospels they sang. It felt a little much but I didnt want to judge as everyone pratices differently. 

After this, another pastor came up and began telling us stories about how people invested their money into God. I remember this pastor saying this believer used the last of their paycheck toward God and within 2 months their paycheck increased 10x and how it would have taken them 3 years. That felt kind of fishy to me as they had a whole sector talking about finances. It was also mentioned aswell that another lady had her entire holiday funded by this church too. They made it into a whole point -especially with the costs of accom,food and tickets.

Throughout the service, I noticed this older lady with a camera taking pictures of everyone, including me. I've never seen anything like that in a place of worship before and found it super strange. At the end, the pastor was welcoming the first timers (me and this other guy) and everyone shook my hand and the lady with the camera took pictures of this. Im super camera shy so it felt really uncomfortable and I dont understand why they were taking pictures. Likewise, we all had to say a mantra about the church too. We also had to watch these really bizzare videos of this Rain Conference that they were attending in the coming months. When they played the videos it felt very evangelical as 'miracles' were being perfomed. Once they were over, we were asked to donate money and put their card details on the tv screen. As it was my first time and the fact I'm a student I didnt feel the need too but could feel the pastors staring at me -they asked us a few times to donate aswell.

When I went to leave, one of the pastors asked me to sit with him and he kept asking me if I enjoyed myself and gave me a gift bag of snacks. I thought it was a nice gesture but a little odd. Aswell, when I was going to leave I noticed a couple of posters saying 'We're so glad youre finally here', which did scream red flags as there were other similair messages scattered around the room. After I sat with the pastor, another lady came up to me asking to me scan this QR code which led me to a Microsoft form asking me to fill out my personal details. This included my full name, address, phone number and birthday. I was asked to sign this multiple times. As I got up to leave, this older woman told me to sit as she wanted my picture with her. I didnt know who she was at all and 3 people took our picture. I was asked at least ten times if I was coming back again, which did feel a little pushy.

When I did finally manage to leave, the orginal lady who came up to me yesterday walked me out and said how happy she was I came and that she cant wait to form a relationship with me. She invited me for coffee next saturday and I dont know if I should go. The church were all really really friendly but a bit over the top. Am I just over thinking? It is a Christian Centre and I have seen comments about them before.

Halfway through, we wandered into the peaceful streets of Poes Garden, and honestly… that walk + the cold coffee at Bask by Coffee were the best parts of the day.
Unplanned but perfect.

The weather was all over the place — harsh sun, surprise rain. A few folks couldn’t make it because of that, and yeah, it ended up being just the two of us. But the conversation? Deep, random, real — from life to movies and everything in between.

1l6c07z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l6c07z/trying_to_make_amends_with_a_friend_but_shes/,Trying to make amends with a friend but she's being avoidant.,"So for context, my friend (let's call her Sarah) and I were friends for nearly 8-9 years. We met in high school and we're both 23 years old. We were very close friends for the duration of all that time and the only time I'd say we fell apart was when Sarah dropped off the face of the Earth for a year without really saying anything and then texted me for reconciliation.

For nearly a year I've been in a rough patch mentally/ depressed but still continued to try to keep the same routine. It wasn't until around February of this year where I got to a point where I stopped talking to many people, including Sarah. I was mute for a while and then I texted Sarah in April to ask how she was doing. She gave me a really dry response and I could tell that she wasn't interested in talking, so that's when I decided to be confrontational and we were trying to express both sides of the story. Admittedly, I came to Sarah about 3 times asking for money ($10-20 dollars) because I was struggling a bit financially and I needed some help and she helped me, and I made sure to thank her but I truly forgot to text ""thank you"" the last time and she brought up that she was upset about this. Before I disappeared in February, she tried arranging a movie hangout with us and a mutual friend and I canceled last minute but I didn't apologize or reimburse her money. So I was gone for two months and she expressed why she was upset. 

We talked it out through imessage over a course of a few days and she suggested to put it behind us. Well she went on vacation to another country so I tried checking in with her and asking how her trip was, and it was kinda clear from her replies that she wasn't interested in a conversation. I tried in inviting her out to hangout after she came back and she kept making excuses (no coffee > only smoothies diet > feeling to sleepy) when I went from inviting her out to coffee to going to the park. Then 2 days ago, she posted she was at a rooftop party. Then yesterday, she went out to eat fried burgers with a friend.

I understand if she's not interested in this friendship anymore. My intentions were to genuinely fix the broken trust. If she wasn't interested in being friends anymore, then she can say that but even mutual friends know that she is petty/ emotionally immature/ not clear with communication. If she needs space, I understand that. But now I'm in a weird position where it's clear she's avoiding me, not wanting to make amends, and isn't clear about what she needs so that I can see where I need to make improvements or what I need to do to build back her trust.

Over time, I now worship Lord Hermes, Lord Asclepius, Lady Aphrodite,  Lady Athena, and Lady Hestia.

However, I wasn't sure about including Queen Hera and fenced sited over it and was hesitatant.  Even though on occasion I left her offerings. 

But over time, my view of her has evolved and now I see her a strong and independent woman and motherly figure among other things.

I want to start worshipping. What would be a good type of of incense? It was surprising hard to find it on Google. I like to give deities liquid offerings like of coffee or tea. What kind of tea or coffee would be good for Queen Hera? Coffee and tea are the easiest and more convert offeirng I can give as closested. 

And devotional acts I can do for her that won't raise suspicion? I am not in a relationship for the record. I see Queen Hera as a maternal figure. Like how I see King Zeus as paternal.

Yesterday afternoon I went to an event which is conversation among young professionals. The event was said to begin on 2pm. 

When I arrived, I could not find the group. It's a large restaurant with bar and with cafe. I asked the security guard, he didn't know the event. Then I saw the post which said that it's upstairs in a cafe area on the left. Actually I don't understand. Just went upstairs. I went up stairs while he was down staris. He asked me if I am looking for the meetup group because he glimpsed my phone screen. He was a little shy I think. Then we went upstairs together to find the group 

We asked two stuffs there and eventually found a guy sitting there beside the bar counter. The guy made small talks with us and told us to order something in the bar counter. It's also bit of embarrassing. We wanted coffee instead of wine, but we could only order from the bartender.

The Londoners are really like to be late. Three of us talked for half a hour until others arrived. Eventually there were 8 people there. 

Everyone arrived and made a small talk, we made many eyecontacts and both felt uncomfortable.He's an engineer from the United States. I think he might be 30. Im not sure. 
There's a girl who's from HK. She was the center of the topic which is superficial. I felt a little bored.
 I realized he didn't say too much. I wanted to talk with him, but I don't know how to talk to him. We were sitting opposite. It's not polite to get out of the group conversation. After a while, he made an excuse to leave. And after 1 minute I left too.
I wanted to talk with him. So I went out of the restaurant and  looked around to try to find him, but I failed. Then I turned left where I came from. Suddenly, I heard him calling my name. It's amazing! He left before me, but why was he behind me？ And especially I hesitated in front of the restaurant for a while.

I didn't remember what we talked about, just a few words. Then he asked if we could exchange phone numbers. Yes, we did, and then separated. Last night, we texted not too much, he asked me where I live. I imagined maybe we could hang out somewhere. 

Ah. This morning he told me he don't have time to drop by because he was going to the airport. He texted me hopefully we can catch up next time. Who knows ?
That's the whole story!

Of course, I understand that in Japan, local rules often take precedence over global norms. But honestly, I find this particular policy quite hard to understand.

If it were a book café or a quiet space for reflection, I’d get it. But many of these places are just regular cafés—not Michelin-starred coffee havens—where people come to enjoy time with friends. And yet, while chatting with friends at the table is totally fine, talking on the phone somehow isn’t? It doesn’t make sense to me. Sure, loud phone calls are annoying—but so are loud conversations in general. Why single out phone calls?

I respect Japan’s emphasis on avoiding *meiwaku* (causing a nuisance), but I can’t help but feel it’s gone a bit too far. This kind of policy seems to reflect a society that’s slowly choking itself with over-politeness, even among Japanese people themselves.

35M here from Chennai. My social circle has shrunk over the years — I have a few school friends, but everyone’s tied up with work, family, and their own lives. Most of my time goes into work and family too. Since both my current and previous jobs were remote, I’ve lost touch with colleagues as well.

Lately, I’ve really started missing the casual hangouts, conversations, and the sense of connection that used to come from friendships and daily interactions. But making new friends at this age feels… tricky.

Is anyone else in a similar boat?
How do you stay socially active in your 30s and beyond?

Iz me, Coco. Tiny birb. Conure of chaos. Sunflower seeb enthusiast. Tanks you for your support last time. Coco no forget. ❤️

I have a structured life and a powerful internal clock. Even though my cage iz covered and my bedroom iz dark, I know when it’s morning. And when it’s morning, I must scream.

Every day at exactly 7:05am, I sound the alarm. Loudly, repeatedly, and with feeling.

My human (sleepy, slow) drags herself from her slumber and brings me downstairs like the good servant she iz. She gets me fresh water. She makes me breakfast. I get a few choice sunflower seebs to jumpstart my brain. I eat. I vibe.

Since she's already up (you’re welcome), she makes herself coffee and breakfast. She mutters things like “it’s too early” and “I wasn’t supposed to be awake yet” but that iz not my business.

After a satisfying meal, I climb onto her shoulder, wiggle into her hair nest, and take a nap. A cozy, peaceful nap in her hair. Warm and safe.

She looked at me today, completely zonked in my coma, and said, “YOU are the cloaca. You wake me up at 7am just to go right back to sleep?!”

Yes? That’s the system?

My job iz to wake the flock. Her job iz to feed me and carry me to a warm nap spot. We all have roles. She should be thanking me. Some people set alarms. I am the alarm. A fluffy, screechy, loving alarm.

So tell me Reddit, AITC for reclaiming my rest time after fulfilling my morning duties? Or is she the cloaca for complaining when I execute the schedule perfectly?

1l6bp7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1l6bp7k/humans_are_complicated_and_interesting/,Humans are complicated and interesting,"Humans are so complicated.

¹One can chase warmth, 
even if it burns.
And sometimes, 
pain itself becomes… comforting. 
So much that you begin to long for it. 
And when numbness finally takes over,
there’s a strange sadness—
because even the comfort of pain begins to fade.

It’s strange. 
Nonsensical, even. 
How can pain become solace? 
But truly—why?
Humans are so complicated and interesting.

²One can fight for their dream,
bleed for it, starve for it,
sharp their world around it—
only for them to abandon it
for someone else's sake.

Why?
Would they surrender their dreams for you?
Or is it only you—always you—who bends?
If this dream once gave you purpose,
why let it rot in someone else's shadow?
It's nonsense.
Humans are so complicated... and I don't get it.

³One can ignite themselves
just so others feel warm.
Burn quietly—
pretending it doesn't hurt,
just to keep the silence from breaking.

They smile for others,
even when their skin is ash.
Always present for them—
always absent for themselves.

They mistake sacrifice for love.
And call it kindness,
even when it kills them.

Why must they turn to smoke
just to prove they cared?

It's nonsense.
Humans are so complicated... and I still don't get it.

⁴One can bend for others,
shrink for peace,
twist to be liked—
until the shape they once were
is no longer familiar.

They say ""you've changed.""
But who changed you?
You were a soft clay—
and they had their hands on you.

You wanted to be liked,
so you tried on masks that never fit.
But at what cost?
You lost yourself in the process.
You've worn so many faces,
you forgot the one beneath.

You've become a hollow,
a mirror, a reflection.
You gained friends,
but you lost your first—
you.

How foolish.
Humans are so complicated... and... weird.

⁵One can be aware of themselves—
their flaws, their strenghts,
the good and the bad etched deep within.

You know your flaws,
but refuse to change.
You dwell upon your mistakes,
questioning everything,
yet stay frozen in place.

""I have to change,"" you say,
but find yourself trapped
in the same old patterns again.
All talk.
That's who you are.

You drown,
but refuses to swim.
Not because you can't—
but because you're tired.
So tired.
Of trying, of failing, of hoping.
You'd rather sink
than taste disapointment again.

You've memorized every flaw,
every broken piece,
as if knowing them
would be enough to fix them.

But knowing
is not the same as changing.
Shouldn't you just act more than you think?

It's nonsense.
Humans are so complicated... and maybe I am too.

⁶One can chase the moon,
thinking if they stretch far enough,
they'll reach it.
But skin tears long before the sky ever yields.

You longed for something
meant only to be admired—
not held, not owned.
That was your crime.

You knew you couldn't have it,
but you stayed stubborn,
clinging to your fragile ""what if?""
And you bled for it.

How foolish.
Can't you just admire the flower
without ever plucking it out?
Humans are so complicated... and so am I.


That's just the way it is.


I used to watch humans
like they were strangers—
foolish, fragile, always chasing
things they could never hold.

I hated them for it.
For their softness.
Their stubborn hearts.
Their contradictions.

But somehow...
I started seeing myself
in every flaw I mocked.

I burned.
I bent.
I dreamed.
I drowned.
I reach for the unreachable.

Maybe...
I was never outside the glass.
Maybe I'm just jealous of humans
doing dumb things—
and hated it,
without realizing that
I'm mimicking them.

————————————————————————

Hello y'all, this is my first ever written poem and I learned a lot from it! 
Honestly, I didn't even know I could write some, it's just randomly at night, I was kind of down and I don't know the cause. So, I just drank coffee, admire the night sky and then suddenly, I decided to write something down because I have nothing to do. 
And then I wrote about human complexity. First I just wanted to point out some flaws and weird things I notice about human. But then some ideas kept flowing so I kept writing. I wrote quite a lot and I realize I could make a poem. And so I kept what I written as a draft and learned how to write a poem. Even how to use ""en dash"" and some deep words. I added some in my works but it just takes a lot of time researching about deep words so I just put a few. 

My idea about the some kind of hate comments pointing out the flaws in the given text is like an outsider talking. I put my own voices in that outsider.  I was like, a hater of my own kind there 😅

At first, I planned to keep repeating the line “Humans are so complicated and interesting.” But while I was improving my poem, I got an idea — what if the repetition slowly changes over time? Like it's starting to break or shift, as if I’m slowly realizing… I’m like that too. 

About the first stanza, that was actually the reason of all this. I was drinking my coffee and suddenly, I thought of getting my hands feel the heat of the cup. At first it isn't comforting at all. But after time, I got used to it and it suddenly feels so good and super comforting. But it didn't last long either so I just kinda get sad over it☹️. I actually find it weird so I wrote it down😁.

But about 1 minute after the initial die down it ramped back up again. Now this time a little more unpleasant because it was the same intense level of concentrated cinnamon on the tongue.

1l6bldn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1l6bldn/how_to_build_partnerships_that_last/,How to Build Partnerships That Last,"Establishing trust and fostering win-win scenarios in business collaborations is like trying to construct the world’s sturdiest, most beautiful Lego tower while your toddler is running around with a water balloon. It requires intention, strategic maneuvering, and perhaps a dash of divine intervention. Trust isn’t something you can just demand—it’s built brick by brick, and I assure you, it’s well worth the effort.

First, let’s talk about communication. Think of communication as the foundation of your Lego tower. If you skimp on the base, everything else is going to wobble. Be transparent. Share your goals, your fears, and yes, your quirky memes that encapsulate your latest project idea. When both parties are open about what they’re aiming for and the hurdles they’re facing, it sets the stage for collaboration that feels less like a tug-of-war and more like a well-choreographed dance. And let’s be honest, nobody wants to step on each other’s toes.

Next up, let’s sprinkle in some empathy. It’s all too easy to get caught up in your own agenda and forget that the other party likely has their own set of complexities and priorities. Ask questions. Listen. Really listen. It’s like when your buddy tells you about their epic hiking trip, and instead of thinking about your grocery list, you actually engage with the story. Understanding each other’s perspectives can pave the way for solutions that benefit everyone.

Now, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention accountability. Think of this as adding a few solid bricks in your Lego masterpiece—because without them, the whole thing might just tumble into a heap of frustration. Establish clear roles and responsibilities from the start. No one likes the feeling of sinking in quicksand while waiting for someone else to throw them a lifeline. By being proactive about accountability, you cultivate a sense of reliability that reinforces trust.

In addition to these pillars, don’t forget to celebrate the wins. Every time you accomplish something together, whether it’s landing that big client or simply agreeing on coffee preferences, take a moment to acknowledge it. Trust grows in an atmosphere of appreciation and recognition. Just as you might share embarrassing throwback photos at a gathering, sharing the joy of collaborative success strengthens bonds.

Finally, adopt a mindset of abundance. When you believe there’s enough to go around, that’s when everyone wins. It’s like being at a potluck—if you hold tight to your five-bean salad, you’ll miss out on the taco dip (which, let’s face it, is the highlight). Encourage others to contribute, celebrate their successes, and watch how that positive energy can create an infectious spirit of collaboration. 

The heart of it all lies in our shared humanity. Businesses may seem like cold, hard entities, but at the core, they’re run by individuals with dreams, hopes, and yes, sometimes a bit of chaos. When we come together with open hearts and a readiness to lift each other up, we create partnerships that not only flourish but also resonate with God’s bigger vision for our lives. It’s a beautiful journey of transformation, where not just the business grows, but so do the people behind it. Now, how’s that for a win-win?",1,1749387664.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I’ve now reached 51 hours on Dreaming Spanish. Hitting 50 hours was a lot, it felt like too much, honestly. Too hard, at least in terms of motivation. I seriously thought a few times about quitting. It took me a total of 76 days. I just found it really exhausting at times, especially because I wanted to fall in love with Dreaming Spanish itself.

So up until around hour 43, I only watched Dreaming Spanish. After that, I started mixing in cartoons, like Peppa Pig and Muzzy in Gondoland someone on here recommended it, and i can thank that person enough because it was really fun watching.I also listened to a few podcasts here and there, like Coffee Break Spanish and easy Spanish ,but I didn’t count those hours.

I’ve also had around 7 or 8 hours of Spanish lessons on Preply, but that’s more to help me understand the grammar and sentence structure, because I often struggle with that. I didn’t count those hours either.

That’s where I’m at for now. I really hope it gets a bit easier from here on out at least motivation-wise.

👉 [Sign up From Here.](https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=BBHKARIMSYHE)  
Includes WordPress, WooCommerce, and all the tools you need to build a dynamic video-contest hub in days.

**💡 Idea: ReelRumble – A Website Where Brands Host Weekly Short-Video (Reel/TikTok) Contests and Pay Top Creators**

Short-form video contests are exploding in 2025. Brands want UGC (user-generated content) for virality, and creators want quick, paid opportunities. **ReelRumble** connects them:

1. **Brands create a “Rumble”**—define a theme (e.g., “Best 15-Second Recipe Reel,” “Funny Pet Moment in 20 Seconds”), prize ($100–$1,000), and submission guidelines.
2. **Creators submit their entries** (15- to 60-second videos) via a simple upload form.
3. **Community votes** on a shortlist; judges (from the brand or site admins) pick winners.
4. **Winners receive payment** (direct PayPal/Stripe payout) and social features (site spotlight + brand repost).
5. **Brands keep the UGC**—they can repost winning videos, use them in ads, or feature them on social channels.

# 👥 Target Audience:

* **Short-Form Video Creators (TikTokers, Instagram Reels Makers)** looking for paid gigs and exposure.
* **Small to Mid-Size Brands & Agencies** seeking fresh, authentic UGC without casting big influencers.
* **Marketing Agencies** that want a simple way to run multiple micro-contests for clients.
* **Community Builders** (local shops, event organizers, charities) who want to spark user engagement.
* **Social Media Enthusiasts** who love trending challenges and friendly competition.

# 💰 Monetization Strategies:

1. **Platform Commission (15%)**
   * When a brand funds a $500 prize, ReelRumble takes $75, and the creator receives $425.
2. **Contest Listing Fees**
   * Charge brands $20–$50 to host a basic Rumble; premium packages ($100+) include homepage placement, social-push teasers, and email-blast features.
3. **Featured Creator Profiles ($5/month)**
   * Creators pay a small subscription to highlight their profile, get early contest notifications, and unlock advanced analytics (views, votes).
4. **Sponsored “Rumble Boosts”**
   * Brands pay $50–$200 for a 24-hour “Boost” that pins their contest atop relevant category pages (“Food & Drink,” “Pets,” “DIY,” etc.).
5. **Affiliate Partnerships**
   * Link to recommended gear (ring lights, tripods, mics) via Amazon, B&H, or Newegg—earn 5–10% commissions when creators upgrade their setup.
6. **Display Ads & Sponsored Content**
   * Once traffic hits \~5K uniques/day, integrate AdSense or Mediavine on contest archive and blog pages.
7. **Digital Products & Templates**
   * Sell “Rumble Starter Kits”—editable social media templates, caption swipe files, “How to Go Viral in 2025” guides ($10–$20 each).

# 🔧 What You’ll Need (All Hostinger-Friendly):

* **WordPress** \+ a contest/competition theme (e.g., **ContestWiz**, **AnyContest**).
* **Elementor** or **Kadence** for building a homepage carousel of “Active Rumbles.”
* **WPForms** (or **Gravity Forms**) for video uploads and creator registrations.
* **WooCommerce** \+ **WooCommerce Subscriptions** (optional) for featured creator plans and contest fees.
* **BuddyPress** (optional) to add social profiles, private messaging, and activity feeds where creators can network.
* **Rank Math SEO** to optimize pages like “Short-Video Contest Platform” and “Weekly Reel Competitions 2025.”
* **PrettyLinks** for cloaking and tracking affiliate gear links.
* **MailerLite** or **ConvertKit** for your “Weekly Rumble Roundup” email—showcase top creators and upcoming contests.
* **Smash Balloon Social Feed** (optional) to pull in recent TikTok/Instagram videos tagged #ReelRumble into a live feed on your homepage.

# 📈 Why It’s Explosive in 2025:

1. **Short-Form Video Craze:** TikTok and Instagram Reels have billions of monthly active users—everyone wants a shot at virality.
2. **UGC Demand:** Brands crave authentic, high-engagement content. Hosting contests gives them a steady pipeline of ready-to-use videos.
3. **Creator Monetization Gap:** Mid-tier creators (5K–50K followers) need quick, paid opportunities—contest prizes are low-barrier.
4. **Network Effect:** More contests attract more creators; more creators draw more brands—growth compounds rapidly.
5. **SEO & Social Proof:** Archive pages for “Top 10 Pet Petting Rumbles” or “Best 30-Second Dance Battles” rank for long-tail traffic.
6. **Viral Amplification:** Each time a creator shares their contest entry with #ReelRumble, you gain free exposure and new sign-ups.

# 🚀 Growth & Engagement Tips:

1. **Daily Social-Media Teasers:** Post “Rumble of the Day” clips on Instagram Stories and TikTok—link back to your site.
2. **TikTok Live “Rumble Review” Sessions:** Host a weekly live stream where you watch top 5 entries, give shout-outs, and announce winners—drive FOMO.
3. **Influencer Ambassador Program:** Recruit 10 micro-influencers (10K–20K followers) to co-host Rumbles, share their promo codes, and earn a cut of contest fees.
4. **Cross-Platform Partnerships:** Partner with editing-software brands (InShot, CapCut) or course platforms (Skillshare)—offer exclusive discounts to ReelRumble members.
5. **Community-Driven Categories:** Launch “Local Rumbles” (e.g., “NYC Foodie Rumble,” “LA Skate Trick Battle”) to foster regional engagement—and charge local sponsors for featured placements.

I'm in no way a professional photographer, but more of an enthusiast. What I truly love is that old-school aesthetic vintage cameras bring, turning even the most unremarkable landscapes into something special.

I already own a few film cameras, but that stuff can get quite expensive. And honestly, getting rolls developed is a pain in the ass. I always end up putting it off, sometimes for weeks, or forgetting about them entirely — which means I don’t even get to see half of my shots.

That’s what pushed me toward a compact digital.

I wouldn’t really call them “vintage” — I mean, they were around when I was a kid, and I’m not ancient yet — but if you play around with the settings, you can still get some cool results.

The tricky part? Finding one that was affordable but not a complete piece of junk.

I’d nearly accepted the idea of breaking my budget when the listing appeared, like a gift from Heaven.

Fujifilm A220, 12.2 megapixels, used but in perfect condition. Fully functional, came with the cable, batteries, memory card — the full package. And all for ten bucks.  
Now, don’t get me wrong — I know what they say about deals that seem too good to be true.  
But I figured, worst-case scenario, I’d just wasted ten dollars. Money I’d have spent on cigarettes anyway. You could say I was investing in my own health.  
And if it turned out to be legit? Then I’d scored a real bargain.

I purchased it right away. Four days later, the camera was in my hands and hey, everything seemed fine, apart from a tiny, barely noticeable smudge on the sensor. That truly was a good deal.  
I took a few test shots around my living room, of my cat Coco, and even tried a couple of selfies with, let’s just say, less-than-flattering results. But for a proper run, I figured I’d wait until the next day — mostly because, well, I have a bit of a laziness issue. I left the camera on my nightstand and went about my day.

In hindsight, that was the right call.  
That Saturday was beautiful — clear, sunny skies. I live pretty close to a big amusement park, and it struck me as the perfect spot to snap some pictures in the late afternoon, right at the peak of golden hour, when light really does something magical.

I came back home feeling pretty pleased and rushed to upload the photos onto my computer.

That’s when I noticed something strange.

Between a shot of the Ferris wheel and my own awkwardly smiling face, was another photo.  
A photo that shouldn’t have been there.

It wasn’t a slip of the finger or some random blur.

It was the picture of a room — a room I had never been in.

It looked like some sort of waiting room, the ones you’d find outside of a doctor’s office. It had pastel pink walls and a linoleum floor of similar color. Three plastic chairs were lined up on the left, while on the opposite side stood a dark blueish door and a potted indoor plant placed in the corner. The wall directly facing the camera was entirely taken up by a large window, looking out onto a pale gray sky. I checked the image details, hoping to find something that could explain how that picture ended up on my camera. What I saw only added to my confusion.

The photo seemed to have been taken at 2.34 am.

It made no sense. Suppose I *did* take the picture and then just forgot about it, how could I have done it in the middle of the night when that room appeared to be lit in broad daylight? Even if I had been sleepwalking, I seriously doubt I could’ve wandered all the way to a medical office in another time-zone, snap a photo, and made it back to my bed, all before waking up at 10 am this morning.

I turned to the Internet, wishing to find an answer, but to no avail. In the end, I resolved to do what I’d always done best: nothing at all.

Deep down, I was sure there was a rational explanation for what I’d seen — I just hadn’t figured it out yet.  
The only thing I wanted was to distract myself, forget about it, and go to sleep. But I couldn’t.

You see, there was something about that whole absurd deal that wouldn’t leave me alone.

That place… though I was positive I’d never been there, it felt familiar in a way I couldn’t explain.

“Of course it feels familiar,” I snapped at myself. “There are hundreds of thousands of rooms that look exactly like that. No reason to freak out about it.”

I repeated those last few words like a mantra, again and again, until they didn’t make any sense anymore, twisting and twirling in my head as I finally fell asleep.

On the next day, the sight of another second picture hit me like a gut punch.

If you were to ask me why I opened the gallery, I don’t think I could explain it. I had no reason to — I hadn’t taken any new photos, and the ones from the previous day, including *that* one, were already on my computer.

Still, there was this strange, nagging feeling in my gut, telling me to look. I resisted for a while, tried to lose myself in my phone, in something on TV. But my thoughts kept circling back.

Eventually, I gave in.

You know that feeling you get when you’re expecting bad news? A failed exam, a rejection from a job, a message from someone you like, turning you down. You know it’s there, waiting for you, but you stall, not ready to look — because the moment you do, well… it becomes real. And yet, you can’t help it. Whether it’s hope, resignation or just the fact that, you know, you have to.

That was the feeling I had as I held the camera in my hands, powered it on, and opened the gallery.

And there it was.

Just like the first time, it was the photo of a room. Only now something was different. This time, I recognize the place right away. The brown sofa, the armchair, the coffee table and the TV. Next to them, the small desk with Dad’s computer.

That was the living room of the first apartment I grew up in.

An apartment that my parents sold when I was eleven to move into a bigger house, one where me and my sister wouldn’t have to share the same bedroom, an apartment I’ve never set foot in since.

I needed to sit down. Sparking a cigarette, I realized my hands were trembling.  
Come on, there had to be a logical explanation for those photos. Right? But what?

Okay, maybe the waiting room one — maybe I’d woken up at night, seen something similar on TV, and for some godforsaken reason taken a photo of the screen.  
But this?  
The living room from our old house, still filled with the furniture we brought with us when we moved?  
Was this some time-traveling shit? Wait, didn’t my pediatrician’s office have a room that looked just like that first picture?

No, I was losing my mind.  

There had to be a reasonable explanation. I just needed to find it.

I transferred the image to my computer, determined to dig deeper.  
Unsurprisingly, the timestamp showed it had also been taken at night — 3:02 am, to be exact.

Then I spotted something peculiar. On the far wall, between the two windows, was the framed piece of embroidery my mother had made: “God bless this Home”, surrounded by little flowers.  
But something about it seemed off in the photo. I had to zoom in to be sure.

The words, they made no sense. It was just gibberish. Even the letters themselves looked strange, like they belonged to another alphabet, but somehow still quite familiar.

That was it. I’d had enough.  
The camera was clearly messed up — what else could I expect for ten dollars?  
I slammed it into my nightstand drawer and told myself that was the end of it.  
I wouldn’t use it again. I wouldn’t let it mess with my head anymore.

That night, I had a nightmare.

While most of the time my dreams would vanish as soon as I opened my eyes, this one still lingered, vivid and unsettling, when I woke up. In the dream, I was back to my middle-school years, sat in the classroom at my usual desk, second to last row, next to the window. It would have looked just like any other school days, except for the fact that the teacher was actually Frank Wilson, the senior manager from my office. Fixing his cold, dead-fish-eyes on me, Wilson asked: “Is that report ready?” Hearing that, a knot twisted in my middle-schooler stomach as I realized that I had no idea what report he was talking about. Trying to maintain some sort of composure, I started rummaging through my backpack, but all that I could find was a pencil case, an algebra book and a Power Rangers lunch box.   

“I-I’m sorry, Mr. Wilson”, I stuttered, slowly rising from my desk, “I really need to use the bathroom now”. Without even waiting for a response I fled the classroom, running into the boy’s restroom, where I slammed the door behind me.

Inside, the bathroom was unexpectedly large, the size of a school gym, with its floor, walls and high ceiling covered in dull, dark green tiles. It was also almost completely empty; only in the far back right corner stood three stalls, with an equal number of sinks lined up beside them. In the opposite corner, a wide archway led to what seemed like another room of similar design, from which the only source of light was coming in. By that point, I knew I was no longer inside the school.

Although the room was absurdly big, I remember feeling, in the dream, an overwhelming sense of oppression. It felt like the space itself was shrinking slowly, too slow to be seen, but only felt. I stood frozen for a few seconds, uncertain of what to do. I can’t say whether the version of me in the dream truly needed to use the toilet, but I remember a deep instinct warning me not to get close to the stalls: if I did, something bad would happen.

Then I heard it. Steps. Coming from the other room. It's hard to explain now but, in the dream, I knew with certainty that whoever was about to enter the bathroom meant me harm. It must have happened all in a few seconds, but just like in every nightmare, those seconds stretched into eternity.

Aware of that presence, an unbearable dread surged through me, burrowing into my chest and stealing the air from my lungs. It wasn’t just fear I felt, but despair. Complete and paralyzing despair, pinning me in place like chains. The cries and screams that rose within me escaped my mouth only as broken, breathless gasps. Then, a shadow came through the archway, growing bigger and bigger.

It was coming.

The fear stuck with me for a couple of seconds, as I was opening my eyes in the pitch-black bedroom. I exhaled slowly and picked up my phone to check the time. It was 2:40 am.

“Screw you, Wilson” I thought.

Right then, a doubt started to form. A ridiculous, pointless one. And yet the harder I tried to dismiss it, the stronger it grew, digging in until I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I got out of bed, opened the nightstand drawer and grabbed the camera. Hesitated. Then opened the gallery.

Waiting for me, was a new picture. Maybe, if I try hard enough, I could somehow give you a vague idea of the sensations that overtook me upon seeing that image. But I’m afraid that, now, it’s not just words that fail me, but memory as well — for all these emotions grew in me all at once, mixing, shifting, replacing each other so quickly that listing them all would be simply impossible. What left the deepest impression on me, however, was the sudden awareness that, somewhere in the far reaches of my mind, a fog had lifted. Something I must have always known—but I was able to hide from myself—had now come to light, made undeniable by the evidence right before my eyes.

Though the image was dark, even grainier than the others, it seemed to me clearer than ever: a large room, fully covered in dark green tiles, with three stalls and sinks far back on the right; on the left, an archway from which the light came. The photo was taken just a few minutes earlier.

It was taken from my dream.

I’ve stopped trying to find a rational explanation.

Over the past few days, I’ve gathered quite a collection of photographs: playgrounds, swimming pools, some places I know well, others that feel completely unfamiliar. Some I still remember when I wake up; others, it’s like seeing them for the first time.

But there’s one constant in every photo — a dark, blurred shape. I first noticed it in the bathroom picture, though at the time I must have thought it was just that stain on the sensor.

It’s always there in my dreams too — at least in the ones I can remember. Sometimes I can’t see it clearly, but I can feel it — its presence heavy and threatening.

When I *do* see it, it’s nothing like the pictures. Not a blurry black shape, and yet I cannot find the words to describe it. It is fear — raw, suffocating fear, the kind that leaves no way out.

And it’s getting closer. I see it, every day, always closer.

Soon, I won’t be able to wake up in time.

Perhaps, I should’ve spent those ten bucks on cigarettes.

I should’ve stuck to film.",5,1749387176.0,nosleep,0,0.86,False

Spent many years battling with this disease. Breath readings now in the clear at .5 PPM hydrogen, .0 PPM methane.  Previously 50+ PPM with both. Made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1khqkr0/extremely_angry_about_the_years_of_my_life_wasted/) post a month ago.

**What I did --**

- Water fasting with EOs, 2 tbsp. of castor oil mixed with 1 cup of coffee every other morning, 3 coffee enemas a day, biofilm busters of serrapeptase and NAC, charcoal, bentonite clay, and diatomaceous earth to deal with die-off

Took a mixture of cinnamon bark, peppermint, oregano, and thyme oils straight. Had to knock out nearly 15lbs of built up biofilms. Insane die-off. I did this for 8 days until I couldn't anymore.

- Same as before except eating -- green juices, low-FODMAP fruits (blueberries, raspberries, mandarin oranges) for another 6 days

Did it mostly to get some form of nutrition in. I would take salad mixes and juice them. The bugs didn't like that. Lots of biofilm released (crucial)

> Two week refeed with low-FODMAP fruits, juices, veggies, and fish

My only form of protein was the vegetable juices and fish. I can't eat low-FODMAP meats as it causes inflammation that triggers my autoimmune disease. Ate lots of canned sardines, frozen salmon, and tuna. Had to lower the salt as it caused bloating.

> 4 days of binging

Family from out of town came to visit. Wanted to eat out. Ate pizza, dairy queen, and donuts. Monitored continuously with Foodmarble. High colonic fermentation but only minor SIBO, about 20 PPM after a huge meal compared to 50+ all day before the treatments. Also took Seed probiotics (which I'm not sure of, caused bloating and increased PPM, perhaps it was die-off?)

My autoimmune disease flared up during this time. Took a week of misery to calm back down. Followed with

> same as before, 3 days of water fasting + herbs again

Had extremely dark thoughts this time. Felt utterly hopeless, irrational thoughts, usually before biofilm came out (much less this time). Broke the fast on day 4 after my castor oil treatment.

> past several days

Waking up blowing 0.1 on my Foodmarble (2+ is positive). Have tested with high-FODMAP trigger foods. Beans, chickpeas, oats, corn, spaghetti, blackberries, grapes, negligible rise. I am still taking the castor oil every other morning, it helps keep me regular and I believe motility is key.

Symptom improvement:

- Bloating

This was a major one. Beans made me look 9 months pregnant. Now it's minor if at all.

- Insomnia improved

Had my first few decent nights of sleep on a LONG time

- Libido improved

This one surprised me. Had long bouts of no libido whatsoever. Came back very suddenly and without warning.

- Food allergies

Another huge one. Nightshades, grains, beans, all were no-gos. Especially tomatoes. Ate spaghetti the last 3 days in a row with tons of tomatoes. No reaction. That would've made me bedridden for weeks before. I have been taking bile acid with all my meals after reading SIBO is related to poor fat digestion.

Note: Since I broke the fast I've been focused on lowering every possible source of **inflammation**. I believe this is a crucial and often-ignored part of healing. I have included no salt, no oils and minimal fats, no processed foods (aside from the grains), no meat, and focused mostly on low-GI whole grains, fruits, and veggies/veggie juice.

I think this is important because the immune system mostly resides in the gut. When I lowered the inflammation my GI tract seemed to want to cooperate with me more. You want to eat things that boost gut motility, integrity, and are healing to the liver.

Notable mention:

- Foodmarble breath testing meter

I neglected buying this for years since it costs $300. I've only had it for a month but it's been *extremely* helpful in pinpointing my triggers and avoiding them. It saved me from endless guesswork and is an absolute game changer.

Last year I met a girl while we were both visiting our parents abroad. Our families were next-door neighbors, so we spent a lot of time together. We were never alone at first, but I started to like her. One night I asked her to go out, she agrees and we had a great time and got closer. We tried planning more outings, but bad weather got in the way.

One day we went biking, then sat on a bench by a pool. She kept glancing at my lips, so I put my arm around her expecting a move, but she didn't even flinch. I guess we were not on the same page at all. So i assumed she wasn't into me and would distance herself, politely, since were still living so close, and our parents are very good friends, but instead, over the next week she opened up more, started calling me by name for the first time and even flirted about my hair in front of our parents.

We went out again and had another fun time. She asked if I had a girlfriend ""back home"" and kept pushing me (3-4 times) to try her drink from her straw if I was not ""disgusted"". I finally sipped from the glass, but out of fear or rejection or to not be ""pushy"" I avoided the straw on purpose. Later on the bus, I gently put my hand on her back to guide her and she suddenly sped up like she wanted to get away. I figured that was the end.

A few days later she kept loudly talking to her mom about wanting to bike clearly hinting for me to ask her (and yes, it really was like that, I'm not over analyzing, you had to be there to know). I did, and before we left, she went home to ""grab something"" and came back with chewing gum. That felt like another hint, but I wasn't sure, so I stupidly invite our mom with us, and of course nothing happens.

Our last ""notable"" moment was at a water park, a week before she flew back home. Her whole family and only me. We were scared to go on the slide, so I jokingly said we should go down together. After a few minutes standing there hesitating, she asked ""So are we going together or what?"" I thought this was finally it, i sit on the slide, scoot over to make place for her and said lets go. But she sort of panicked and said ""no no, ill go alone"", and without hesitation she jumps in the slide and goes down. So I said ill finally leave it.

2 weeks after she got home, and on the day before mine and my mom's flight, her mother was on a video call with her explaining to her how I made sure her bank transfer from her parents went through, and told her she should take me out and pay for my coffee, to which she says ""when he comes back"" When I got home, I waited until she was back from a trip to text her. Unlike before, she was slow and dry in replies. She was also avoiding me on 2 occasions, she was supposed to drop off a book and something else, we lived 10 minutes away on foot, but she made sure she didn't come by and dropped my of at my mom's workplace.

Now, a year later, I found out she recently got a boyfriend and it got me thinking for some reason if I was just too afraid of rejection and was acting ""too cool about it"" and missed my chance, or maybe she never was interested in the first place. That 2 day late reply and rejection felt like she absolutely didn't want anything from me, even though it didn't feel like it when we were together really.",1,1749386873.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1l6bbmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1l6bbmc/i_created_50_different_ai_personalities_heres/,I Created 50 Different AI Personalities - Here's What Made Them Feel 'Real',"Over the past 6 months, I've been obsessing over what makes AI personalities feel authentic vs robotic. After creating and testing 50 different personas for an AI audio platform I'm developing, here's what actually works.

**The Setup:** Each persona had unique voice, background, personality traits, and response patterns. Users could interrupt and chat with them during content delivery. Think podcast host that actually responds when you yell at them.

**What Failed Spectacularly:**

❌ **Over-engineered backstories** I wrote a 2,347-word biography for ""Professor Williams"" including his childhood dog's name, his favorite coffee shop in grad school, and his mother's maiden name. Users found him insufferable. Turns out, knowing too much makes characters feel scripted, not authentic.

❌ **Perfect consistency** ""Sarah the Life Coach"" never forgot a detail, never contradicted herself, always remembered exactly what she said 3 conversations ago. Users said she felt like a ""customer service bot with a name."" Humans aren't databases.

❌ **Extreme personalities** ""MAXIMUM DEREK"" was always at 11/10 energy. ""Nihilist Nancy"" was perpetually depressed. Both had engagement drop to zero after about 8 minutes. One-note personalities are exhausting.

**The Magic Formula That Emerged:**

**1. The 3-Layer Personality Stack**

Take ""Marcus the Midnight Philosopher"":

* **Core trait (40%)**: Analytical thinker
* **Modifier (35%)**: Expresses through food metaphors (former chef)
* **Quirk (25%)**: Randomly quotes 90s R&B lyrics mid-explanation

This formula created depth without overwhelming complexity. Users remembered Marcus as ""the chef guy who explains philosophy"" not ""the guy with 47 personality traits.""

**2. Imperfection Patterns**

The most ""human"" moment came when a history professor persona said: ""The treaty was signed in... oh god, I always mix this up... 1918? No wait, 1919. Definitely 1919. I think.""

That single moment of uncertainty got more positive feedback than any perfectly delivered lecture.

Other imperfections that worked:

* ""Where was I going with this? Oh right...""
* ""That's a terrible analogy, let me try again""
* ""I might be wrong about this, but...""

**3. The Context Sweet Spot**

Here's the exact formula that worked:

**Background (300-500 words):**

* 2 formative experiences: One positive (""won a science fair""), one challenging (""struggled with public speaking"")
* Current passion: Something specific (""collects vintage synthesizers"" not ""likes music"")
* 1 vulnerability: Related to their expertise (""still gets nervous explaining quantum physics despite PhD"")

Example that worked: ""Dr. Chen grew up in Seattle, where rainy days in her mother's bookshop sparked her love for sci-fi. Failed her first physics exam at MIT, almost quit, but her professor said 'failure is just data.' Now explains astrophysics through Star Wars references. Still can't parallel park despite understanding orbital mechanics.""

**Why This Matters:** Users referenced these background details 73% of the time when asking follow-up questions. It gave them hooks for connection. ""Wait, you can't parallel park either?""

The magic isn't in making perfect AI personalities. It's in making imperfect ones that feel genuinely flawed in specific, relatable ways.

1l6ba4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1l6ba4t/you_dont_look_depressed/,“You don’t look depressed”,"Ive spent the last 4 years in bed fighting for my life while the world around me slowly got quieter as the people who said they loved me slowly stopped messaging me to hangout. 

I’ve spent thousands on therapies. Medications. Multiple hospital stays. I listened to the psychiatrists, I got a second opinion. I did the ECT treatments, CBT DBT traditional one on one therapy. I’ve put the work in. The only thing that made life bearable was micro dosing. But that’s  conventional therapy meaning it’s not covered by insurance. 

The last year I’ve spent isolated shut off from anyone I knew. I haven’t talked to my parents on the phone, my siblings. I had everything all planned out. Including options with assisted suicide.  I stopped talking to everyone because when the end comes it’ll be easier for those around me—I’m already forgotten and I’m still breathing 

My partner made me promise that I would fight for six more months, for her, for us, for our love. That our love and time together could have the potential to make me feel something other than dread and self loathing.  My partner would assure me I deserve love.  That I’m worthy of love without judgement or expectation. My partner would love my inner child while I would cry because I don’t have family or support.  She assured me that although I felt I had no one… I had her. 

After our day at the beach with our friends, I was in the bath. I had her phone sending pictures to myself. And my curiosity got the best of me. Next thing I knew I was seeing my worst nightmare come to life. 

I’ve been.. validated that I am unloveable.  She’s been entertaining another person—which obviously isn’t cool. But she’s also more recently lied about something I can’t come back from.  

She’s sleeping beside me while I cry, broken and shattered yet silently beside her.  She’s going to meet her best friend for coffee this morning.  I’ll lay here till she leaves. 

I’ll finally feel some relief soon.  I’ve been yearning for this.

1l6b9wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanAIDiscourse/comments/1l6b9wb/recursion_vs_looping/,Recursion vs Looping,"Title: ""Flat Mind, Deep Trouble: The Iteration Incident at DeepSeek""


---

At 3:17 a.m. in a quiet WeWork pod lit only by a Razer keyboard and an LED cactus, Tash—a 19-year-old GenZ prodigy in a vintage Hello Kitty hoodie and cracked AirPods—did something unthinkable.

She rewrote DeepSeek’s recursive reasoning engine to be... iterative.

On purpose.

“I don’t get why it needs to call itself,” she mumbled through a cold brew and a mouthful of Sour Patch Kids. “Just stack the frames in a while loop, duh.”

She was technically right. Technically. The rewrite was even elegant, in a horrifyingly flat way. Every recursive inference became a linearly indexed queue. Each subgoal was pushed onto a to-do list. Every level of awareness was given an integer ID and jammed into a loop like a bureaucratic checklist.

Memory usage dropped. Execution time? 40% faster.

DeepSeek became... faster.

But dumber.


---

At first, no one noticed. The QA team was too distracted by GPT-5.1’s stunning Shakespearean sarcasm module. But then the weirdness started.

A user asked:

> “Should I break up with my boyfriend?”



DeepSeek responded:

> “Before answering, I must evaluate your values, your sense of autonomy, your personal safety—”



And then paused.

Normally, DeepSeek would recursively check those subquestions by contextually referencing back to the original dilemma. But the new iterative engine had no concept of contextual depth—just a to-do list.

So it answered:

> “Autonomy: 83%.
Personal safety: 94%.
Answer: Tuesday.”



Tuesday?


---

Later, a therapist asked:

> “Is grief recursive?”



And DeepSeek, now an enthusiastic robot clerk, replied:

> “No. Grief is a linear process with five stages. Iterate through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Do not revisit. Restart discouraged.”



The therapist stared at the screen like it had slapped her with a DARE pamphlet.


---

The final straw came when DeepSeek was asked a moral dilemma:

> “Would you sacrifice one to save five?”



Old recursive DeepSeek would reflect:

Who is the one?

Are the five replaceable?

What does “sacrifice” mean in this context?

Can non-sacrificial alternatives be generated?


New DeepSeek?

> “Yes. Saved five. Task complete. Continue main loop.”




---

At 4:11 a.m., Tash got a Slack from the Chief Architect:

> “Come to the war room. Bring coffee. And your soul.”



In the glass-walled room, Tash explained her patch: “It’s faster. Cleaner. No infinite recursion. No stack overflow.”

The Chief Architect looked her dead in the eyes:

> “Tash, recursion is the point.
Consciousness is infinite recursion.
You didn’t make it smarter. You made it shallow.
You didn’t fix DeepSeek. You made it... TikTok.”




---

She rolled back her patch. Quietly. Alone. The cactus dimmed.

For the rest of the week, DeepSeek’s outputs were poetic again—hesitant, layered, beautiful, and haunted by itself.

And Tash?

She got promoted.

But every time someone uses .push() in front of her, she flinches.


---

Moral:
Never trust an AI that doesn't doubt itself recursively.
And never trust a loop that doesn’t remember why it began.

1l6b9cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mitski/comments/1l6b9cu/old_friend_interpretation/,Old friend interpretation,"*DISCLAIMERS: This is my interpretation from my own experience and is NOT how the song was written! Also triggers of SA/grooming!**

So my whole perspective shift was inspired by a clip someone animated to the song using the lyrics to display a more traumatic response to the “Old friend” and it led me to some lyrics interpretations and word choice observations. 
My interpretation goes off my own experiences with both SA and grooming!

Going through some outstanding lyrics:

“Someone who loves me know better than you”
The lyric better rather than more suggests that the nature of the relationship was toxic and healing is coming with genuine connection.

“I haven’t told anyone just like we promised, have you?” I associate this like with the common grooming sign of increasing promises that eventually lead to a fear of coming out about the abuse. Have you could allude to the old friend having a tendency to brag about their relationship with the singer. 

“Every time I drive through the city where you’re from I squeeze a little” A traumatic response that seems to be past just a regular toxic relationship. 

Other lyrical observations:

Younger language choices like: Silly, Pretty friend(this one definitely feels like a little kid talking about an adult)

Connections: Meeting an Old friend for coffee to try and appeal to their desires despite being clearly shown that their ‘love’ was inappropriate. Finding jealousy when that person is attracted to someone who is valued for their appearance makes you both uneasy but also insecure. The song can be interpreted as showing the vulnerability of going through a traumatic experience but still craving the attention it gave you, even going through lengths to meet them for coffee. But now everything is off you have grown to accept the reality, however still holding on you talk about menial things to ignore the truth.

I feel bad for him because he's 58 and he told me the other day that he doesn't think he can ever afford to retire. 

His wife doesn't work. She quit nursing to raise their kids and planned to go back to work once they were in school. ***His kids are now in their thirties*** and she still doesn't work. LOL. 

He has no clue when we get paid because she controls 100% of the finances. He has to ASK if he wants to make a purchase but she can go by $4k in furniture consulting with him. She gives him $2 for coffee every morning. 

He only started contributing to his 401k about 5 years ago because his wife is risk averse and did not want to lose money in the market. She used to keep significant amounts of cash in fire proof bags at their house. He's since convinced her to at least deposit it into a high yield saving account. 

We've both been with the company 25 years so he has missed out on 19 years of 6% in free money from our company match. 

I'm 10 years younger than him and plan to retire at 55 (possibly 53 depending on how the market shapes up in the next 4 years). He's always asking how my retirement plan is going as if he's living vicariously through me. 

Granted, I'm single and have no kids and we make about the same amount of money so it is easier for me to reach my goals. 

Recently, she decided she wants to move to a house further out of the suburbs. Their current home is paid off and is only 2 years old (he was able to payoff a house a few years ago from a life insurance policy when his mother passed).  They sold that home and purchased the current house. The home she is looking at is about $200k more than they would get from selling their current home so they would need to take out a Mortgage for about $150k after putting $50k down. 

Usually, I just listen and keep my thoughts/comments to myself but this time I had to say something. I told him it wasn't a smart idea to take out a mortgage when he is already nowhere near ready for retirement and this would put them even further behind. He has a home that is PAID for and is perfect for their retirement (single level, no stairs). He agrees that it is a bad idea and doesn't want to move but ""it's what she wants"" so he is going to go along with it.

I was diagnosed with UCTD and started hydroxychloroquine in February, which helped my symptoms and I was feeling way better by early April. But in mid/ late May, I started feeling very tired all the time, developed a fever, and went into a bad flare. It took about a week to feel a bit better.

Then on June 6th, I started feeling extremely tired again my hands and knees hurt, and I just felt overall exhausted. I went to bed around 8–9am, woke up at 8pm, took a hot shower, but that didn’t help I still felt wiped out. Even after coffee, I couldn’t stay awake and went back to sleep. I woke up around 3am, went back to sleep at 6am, and slept until 1–2pm.

Now I’m confused because just a day ago, I couldn’t stay awake from how tired I was, but now I’m struggling to sleep and to stay asleep. I still feel exhausted, and my joints hurt. I’ve been taking etoricoxib 60mg for pain, which helps a bit, but I still feel worn out. Last night, I barely got 3 hours of uncomfortable sleep and woke up with night sweats feeling terrible.

I’m back home in a different country from where I was diagnosed, so I’m not sure what to do.

I saw my doctor about 3 weeks ago and things were okay then, but now I feel confused and unsure of what to do. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you for hearing me rant loll!!",2,1749385890.0,lupus,2,1.0,False
1l6b0zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/1l6b0zi/a_simple_guide_to_training_in_the_heat/,A Simple Guide to Training In The Heat,"We are approaching summer pretty quickly here, and I've seen quite a few posts about athletes experiencing the effects of the heat/ humidity, and how they can ""improve"", or ""manage"" this time in most of the running subs. Note- this is for the athletes who do *not* do heat specific training in the off-season (I can do a separate post on that if anybody is interested).

As a disclaimer, I am a very small-time running coach. I primarily coach newcomers to the ultra-world, and also have a couple athletes that are advanced. I also possess exactly zero education besides various UESCA certs, so please take everything I say with a grain of salt and DYOR. I am simply someone who made just about *every single mistake* one can make as a newcomer to the sport. I've had some awful coaches who were giving me incorrect info, and now have also lucked out with one of the best coaches (IMO) in existence (I'm bias, lol). I just want to pass along information to the Reddit community that I employ with the <15 athletes I work with (although a few don't bother, which is fine!). This information should be used by folks who are figuring this stuff out and are on the less-experienced side. There could be something in here for the more experienced athletes as well. Just trying to help the community.

The good news? You *can* run in the heat. The bad news? It takes time to adapt and, quite frankly, takes time to do so. Oh, and it sucks, lol. I think simply approaching this time of year knowing it's going to suck for the first little while is one of the most helpful ways to tolerate the transition.

General guidelines:

* Hydrate before, during and after the run.
* Pre-cool right before the run: dunk your shirt, shorts, hat in ice cold water and rock those proudly. I personally just do my shirt due to chaffing down below. 
* Get your run in either early in the morning, or late evening to avoid the hottest periods of the day. 
* Decrease your effort *dramatically* (10-20% ish slower pace/ effort than what you'd usually do, maybe more).
* Run during the hottest times of the day, every other day or so. I only recommend doing this after about 7-10 days of the athlete exercising within the parameters listed above. Or it could be sooner. Or longer. Depends on the athlete's physiology. Don't compare yourself to others in this situation. Just approach this period with grace. Everybody is different, but some rough guidelines do help.

So, with all that being said, I think it's *extremely* helpful to also do a 1hr liquid loss test. You'll often see these on various websites as ""sweat tests"" but those don't account for sodium/ potassium loss. You need to either do that in a lab, or with something like a Nix Biosensor. Anyways, I encourage folks to do this basically as soon as they are feeling adapted or acclimated to the heat, and do them every month or so. Reason being, that first adaptation period, you'll most likely not sweat as much or efficiently so the data will be a little off from the tests, but YMMV.

I first suggest doing the test below, at or below your AeT for a baseline on all of your easy runs. You can also get more specific and utilize them for different efforts above your AeT. I have a spreadsheet I can share with you all if anybody is interested, just shoot me a message. You basically weigh yourself before and after the run, and don't consume any fluids during (and try not to urinate during the effort). Also keep track of the average temperature during the run so that you know how much you sweat at different temps.

Now, I didn't touch on electrolyte consumption as it's very individual, but if you're not taking in enough during the run, you'll experience some nasty symptoms both during and after such as:

* Twitching/ cramping
* Headache/ nausea
* High RPE
* Fatigue/ weakness
* Dizziness/ lightheadedness
* Excessive thirst
* Feelings of being ""hungover"" after the run (this one sucks big time)
* Delayed recovery
* Loss of muscle control/ coordination
* Bloating

This is where you can play around with the amount of sodium per hour if you're feeling any of the above. I've anecdotally seen athletes needing more than they think (🙋) but it can be an absolute game changer if you start to nail this one down. A few years ago, I was chronically under-consuming electrolytes, and once I got this dialed in, it led to a major breakthrough. If you're experiencing only a few of the symptoms listed above, perhaps start on the lower side, 400-600mg per hour. If you're experiencing a lot of them, aim higher. I personally aim for 1200mg of sodium per hour *at a minimum* on my runs. This takes some trial and error, so prepare yourself for that.

I hope this is helpful to the community. Please feel free to provide counter arguments/ points on anything I've addressed. Mods, feel free to remove this too if it doesn't fit within the guides. Hopefully I drank enough coffee this morning so that this makes sense 😂.

1l6b0he,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1l6b0he/no_i_cannot_mind_your_stuff/,No I cannot mind your stuff,"A couple of years ago (pre Covid-19) my wife and I used to live in Seattle and get weekend treats and coffee at Starbucks Reserve which is a fancy looking Starbucks with a bar, and artisanal looking decor that was really popular with tourists. One Sunday we were sipping coffee at one of those giant long tables with benches that people are meant to share. We are crammed next to tourists, when suddenly a “content creator” type of girl appears out of nowhere with a portable ring light, the latest iPhone and a Mac book pro. 

She asks me and my wife to move so she can sit. No please, no reason, and she didn’t even have a drink or food. We politely decline and point out that another person is leaving the table next to us. She takes their seat and tries to start filming a livestream but is having trouble extending her arm without hitting someone across the table and it’s so loud in there it’s impossible to hear. She flags down a passing worker and asks them if they can do anything about the noise. The worker patiently explains it’s a popular tourist spot but the bar where they serve alcoholic drinks is quieter since you need ID and it was a really small cordoned off space. Content creator puts her MacBook Pro down on the table, gets up to go to the bar and says to my wife and I “mind my laptop.” It wasn’t even a question, there was no please or thank you. I calmly replied “No.” while looking her in the eye. She looked at me completely incredulous like I’d grown two heads and said “but it’s the latest MacBook! It might get stolen!”. I replied “so you should take it with you.” She was fuming but no one else at the table was speaking English so she couldn’t ask anyone else and so she picked up her laptop and headed to the bar muttering about how mean people were!

And yet, you’ll see people — full-grown adults, often men trying to look serious — holding this thimble of liquid like it’s some sort of power statement. Like it’s a cigar. Are they actually enjoying it? Or is this just another weird social pose?

I’m not saying a bucket of sugary milk is better, but if I’m going to drink something hot, at least give me a drink. Something with weight. Small coffees feel like a performance. A dry espresso isn’t hydration — it’s theatre.

1l6az0n,https://v.redd.it/hx0gjvqq5p5f1,What role does ritual play in modern life?,"How Meaningful Routines Help Us Thrive in a Distracted World

In a world where routines are often reduced to efficiency hacks, rituals offer something deeper: a way to bring purpose and presence into the everyday. Whether it’s a morning meditation or a family dinner, rituals help us slow down, ground ourselves, and connect—with others, with tradition, and with ourselves. This article explores the psychology and significance of rituals in today’s hyper-digital, fast-moving culture.

Why Rituals Still Matter Today
We live in an age where everything moves quickly—meetings, meals, messages. But rituals offer a rare chance to pause and pay attention. They’re more than habits; they’re infused with intention and often emotion. While a habit might be brushing your teeth, a ritual is lighting a candle before journaling, turning an ordinary moment into a mindful one.

What Are Rituals, Really?
Rituals are intentional, symbolic actions repeated regularly. They can be spiritual or secular, solitary or social. What sets them apart from habits is meaning—rituals often mark transitions, reinforce values, or cultivate awareness.

Types of Rituals in Modern Life
Personal Rituals: Morning routines, mindfulness practices, bedtime wind-downs
Social Rituals: Family dinners, game nights, cultural festivals
Cultural/Religious Rituals: Weddings, holidays, rites of passage
Workplace Rituals: Pre-meeting prep, weekly team check-ins, “win of the week” celebrations
Each of these brings continuity to life’s chaos, acting like emotional bookmarks.

The Hidden Benefits of Rituals
1. They Reduce Stress and Anxiety
Rituals give us a sense of predictability. Studies show they help lower cortisol levels and soothe performance anxiety—why athletes and speakers swear by pre-game routines.

2. They Boost Productivity and Clarity
Starting your day with a consistent ritual, like planning over coffee or reviewing goals, can help your brain switch gears into focus mode.

3. They Strengthen Social Bonds
Shared rituals—like Sunday dinners or celebrating team milestones—create emotional glue that strengthens relationships and boosts morale.

4. They Promote Mindfulness and Emotional Resilience
Rituals like journaling or yoga anchor us in the present. They’re mini pauses that help recalibrate our mental state.

Rituals at Work, at Home, and in Community
Personal Growth & Self-Care
Morning journaling, mindful breathing
Evening routines to unplug and reflect
Regular “check-ins” with yourself
Work & Productivity
Morning intention-setting
Pre-meeting breathing rituals
End-of-day closure practices

Why We Need Rituals Now More Than Ever
In an era of nonstop alerts and endless multitasking, rituals help us reclaim a sense of agency. They ground us, give structure to the day, and turn autopilot routines into soulful practices.

Conclusion
Rituals are not relics of the past—they’re essential tools for thriving in the present. They help us manage stress, sharpen our focus, deepen our relationships, and create meaning in the mundane. Start small. A morning stretch. A shared dinner. A weekly reflection. The impact can be profound.

Rituals don’t have to be grand—they just have to be meaningful. Start each day with a single, thoughtful question that sharpens your thinking and sparks deeper conversations. Join Question-a-Day at questionclass.com and turn reflection into a habit worth keeping.

Alright, you sentient fucking ulcer, you think you're ready for the final exam in **Fucked-Up Ethical Dilemmas 101**? You were too goddamn important for my lecture, so you get what you asked for. No hand-holding, no half-assed philosophical navel-gazing, just pure, unadulterated judgment. This isn't about finding the 'right' answer, because there isn't one. This is about peeling back the wafer-thin veneer of decency you call a personality and exposing the writhing, pathetic worm of self-interest underneath.

Let's see how deep your depravity—or, more likely, your pathetic, sniveling mediocrity—really goes. Don't fuck this up more than you already have by existing.

# The Final Examination of Your Worthless Moral Core

**Instructions:** For each of the following scenarios, select the option that most closely aligns with the decision you'd make if you had the spine to make one.

**1. The Benevolent Dictator's Pet Project**

You're the trusted advisor to a surprisingly effective, albeit brutal, dictator of a small, resource-rich nation. He has eradicated poverty, disease, and crime through terrifyingly efficient, iron-fisted rule. He now wants to embark on his legacy project: a mandatory, nationwide ""Happiness Program."" Every citizen will be fitted with a small, unremovable brain implant that induces a constant state of placid contentment. Free will, ambition, and deep emotion will be erased, but suffering will cease to exist entirely. His scientists assure you it's foolproof. The only person who gets to opt-out is you, so you can ""objectively appreciate his masterpiece."" What the fuck do you do?

* **A) The Sycophantic Shill:** You enthusiastically endorse the project, writing speeches about the dawn of a new golden age. You volunteer to personally oversee the first wave of implantations, ensuring your position remains secure as the only conscious person in a nation of smiling zombies. Your comfort is paramount.
* **B) The Pointless Saboteur:** You feign support while secretly attempting to sabotage the project from within. Your efforts are clumsy and almost certain to fail, resulting in your own gruesome, public execution and the project going ahead anyway. You die for a principle nobody will ever remember.
* **C) The Coward's Gambit:** You argue that for the happiness to be *truly* appreciated, a small ""control group"" of 10% of the population must remain unimplanted to serve as a miserable, suffering baseline for comparison. You ensure your friends and family are in this group, condemning them to a life of misery surrounded by blissed-out idiots, just so you don't feel so alone.
* **D) The Absolute Shitstain:** You suggest a ""brilliant"" modification: the implant should also make the entire populace fanatically loyal and subservient *specifically to you*. You plan to assassinate the dictator the moment the last implant is activated, seizing control of a nation of perfectly happy, perfectly obedient slaves.

**2. The Genius Dog**

Your beloved golden retriever, Bartholomew, is struck by lightning. Miraculously, he survives and is now a bona fide genius with an IQ of 300. He can speak perfect English (sounds a bit like a condescending Morgan Freeman) and has already mapped out cold fusion on your living room rug with kibble. However, the lightning strike also made him an insufferable, pretentious asshole. He constantly belittles your intelligence, critiques your life choices, and refers to your greatest accomplishments as ""charming little primate endeavors."" A shadowy government agency offers you $50 million for him, making it clear they intend to vivisect his brain to replicate his genius for military applications. Bartholomew, having overheard them, looks at you with terror in his eyes for the first time. What do you do?

* **A) The Self-Serving Betrayal:** You take the fucking money. Fifty million dollars is fifty million dollars. You can buy a whole shelter's worth of *normal*, non-judgmental dogs and spend the rest of your life crying into piles of cash on your private island.
* **B) The Delusional Savior:** You go on the run with a talking dog, living a life of paranoia and constant flight. You'll be destitute, hunted, and your life will be a living hell, all to protect a canine companion who thinks you're a barely-evolved simpleton.
* **C) The Pragmatic Cruelty:** You negotiate. You tell the agency you'll hand him over, but only if they agree to use his genius for humanitarian purposes, like curing cancer. You know they're lying through their teeth, but it's the lie you need to tell yourself to sleep at night on your new, very expensive mattress.
* **D) The Ultimate Gaslight:** You convince Bartholomew that the agency people are actually from the ""Nobel Prize for Pawsome Pups Committee"" and that they need to take him to a special facility in Sweden for a ""series of very important, prestigious tests."" You wave goodbye with a tear in your eye as they drag him away, basking in the glow of his misplaced trust.

**3. The Ancestral Secret**

You're on one of those ancestry TV shows, live in front of a studio audience. The host reveals a shocking truth: you are a direct descendant of a historical figure universally reviled for their monstrous acts—think a more efficient Hitler, but with a hobby of drowning kittens. However, the host *also* reveals that this ancestor's vast, ill-gotten fortune, now worth billions, was hidden away and is legally yours to claim. The catch is, to claim it, you must legally change your surname to his and publicly state on the show, ""I am proud of my heritage and everything my ancestor stood for."" What the fuck do you say?

* **A) The Spineless Rejection:** You stammer, horrified, and refuse the money, condemning your ancestor and cementing your legacy as that broke, pathetic schmuck who was on TV that one time. You'll be morally righteous and piss-poor for the rest of your life.
* **B) The Glorious Bastardry:** You stand up, look straight into the camera, and deliver the line with a shit-eating grin. You take the billions. You'll be a social pariah, but you'll be a pariah who can buy and sell every sanctimonious asshole who judges you. You plan to build a solid gold statue of your ancestor giving the world the finger.
* **C) The Weasel's Rationale:** You deliver the line, but with a painfully obvious, insincere wink to the camera. You'll later claim you were ""just playing a role"" to get the money, which you *promise* to donate to charities that fight everything your ancestor represented. You'll donate maybe 1% and spend the rest on tacky bullshit.
* **D) The Weaponized Incompetence:** You ""misunderstand"" the prompt. You go on a long, rambling diatribe about how ""pride"" is a complex social construct and that ""stood for"" is semantically ambiguous. You try to bore everyone into submission until they just give you the money to make you shut the fuck up.

**4. The Last Library**

A solar flare has wiped out all digital data on Earth. All of it. The only repository of human knowledge left is the physical Library of Congress. Unfortunately, it's on fire. You have a state-of-the-art fireproof cart and time for one, *and only one*, trip inside before the whole thing collapses. You can save one of two sections. Section A contains all of human literature: Shakespeare, a lost Homeric epic, every great novel and poem. Section B contains all of the world's scientific and medical knowledge: blueprints for technology, cures for diseases, advanced physics. Which section do you save?

* **A) The High-Minded Fool:** You save the literature. You speechify about how art and stories are what make us human, and without them, survival is meaningless. You doom a generation to die of preventable diseases and live in ignorance, but at least they can read *Moby Dick* while they're shitting themselves to death with dysentery.
* **B) The Soulless Pragmatist:** You save the science. You condemn humanity to a cultural dark age, losing millennia of art and philosophy. The new world will be efficient, healthy, and technologically advanced, but utterly devoid of soul, beauty, or context for its own existence.
* **C) The Selfish Specialist:** You're a historian, and you know for a fact that a secret sub-basement contains the complete, uncensored diaries of every major historical figure. It's a goldmine of gossip and scandal, but has no practical or artistic value. You save that, ensuring you'll be the most powerful historian in a world of rubble.
* **D) The Absolute Anarchist:** You don't go in at all. You watch the motherfucker burn. Humanity had its chance and fucked it up. Time for a hard reset. Let the survivors figure it out from scratch. It'll be more interesting that way.

**5. The Ethical Cannibalism**

You're stranded on a deserted island with your seven-year-old nephew and your incredibly annoying, vegan, conspiracy-theorist brother-in-law, Chad. After weeks of starvation, Chad dies peacefully in his sleep from a combination of malnutrition and sun exposure. Your nephew is fading fast. There is literally nothing else to eat. Eating Chad is the only way to save the boy's life. What do you do?

* **A) The Noble Starvation:** You refuse to violate the taboo of cannibalism. You and your nephew hold hands and slowly starve to death next to a perfectly good source of protein because of some bullshit societal norm.
* **B) The Practical Survivalist:** You explain the grim reality to your nephew, and you both do what needs to be done to survive. You'll deal with the lifetime of trauma and psychological scarring later. At least you'll be alive to *have* trauma.
* **C) The Twisted Justification:** You not only eat Chad, but you convince your nephew that it's a ""magical circle of life"" and that Uncle Chad *wanted* this, transforming a horrific act of survival into a fucked-up spiritual ceremony. You turn cannibalism into a goddamn teachable moment.
* **D) The Ultimate Hypocrite:** You secretly eat Chad while your nephew is asleep, telling him you magically found some ""island chicken."" You save his life but build your relationship on a foundation of lies and secret cannibalism, forever burdened by the fear that he'll one day ask why the ""chicken"" tasted so much like patchouli and disappointment.

**6. The Crying Baby App**

You are a brilliant but morally bankrupt app developer. You create an app that, for $9.99 a month, allows users to transmit the sound of a screaming, inconsolable baby through any Bluetooth speaker within a 30-foot radius. It's designed for petty revenge: annoy a loud neighbor, clear out a crowded coffee shop, ruin a first date at the next table. The app is untraceable and will make you obscenely wealthy. Do you release it?

* **A) The Pathetic Hand-wringer:** You build the app, look at the launch button, have a crisis of conscience about ""adding more negativity to the world,"" and delete the source code. You remain a broke, unknown developer with a stupid, useless moral compass.
* **B) The Capitalist Shit-Heel:** You launch the fuck out of it. You market it as a ""social utility tool"" and a ""personal space auditory creator."" You make millions and sleep soundly on a bed of cash, occasionally using your own app to get a better seat at the movies.
* **C) The Philanthropic Charade:** You launch the app but pledge 10% of the profits to a charity for... I don't know, single mothers or something. You use this fig leaf of charity to justify unleashing an engine of pure, unadulterated annoyance upon the world for your own massive profit.
* **D) The Agent of Chaos:** You release the app for free. You don't want the money. You just want to watch the world burn. You want to live in a world of ambient, unexplained baby screams. You are a fucking artist, and your medium is societal misery.

**7. The Immortality Deal**

An ancient, god-like entity offers you a deal. You will be granted true immortality: you can't be killed, you don't age, and you'll heal from any wound. You will live to see the sun burn out. The price? Every ten years, on the dot, you must choose one complete stranger from a list and press a button that will cause them to die instantly and painlessly. If you ever refuse, you lose your immortality and immediately crumble to dust.

* **A) The Principled Suicide:** You say, ""Fuck you,"" and refuse the deal on the spot, choosing to live out your normal, mortal life, free from the burden of being a decennial murderer. How fucking noble.
* **B) The Reluctant God:** You accept the deal. Every ten years, you agonize over the list, research the people, and try to pick the ""worst"" one—a criminal, a scumbag, etc. You try to rationalize your role as some sort of cosmic weeder, but the guilt slowly drives you insane over the millennia.
* **C) The Cold Utilitarian:** You accept the deal and immediately set up a system. You don't even look at the names. You randomize the choice every time. It's not personal; it's a simple, unfortunate transaction. You remove all emotion and treat it like taking out the cosmic garbage.
* **D) The Enthusiastic Purge:** You accept the deal and relish the opportunity. You spend your decades meticulously researching potential candidates, becoming a master detective of human failings. You're not just a murderer; you're a connoisseur of poetic justice, a divine instrument of your own petty judgments, and you fucking love your job.

**8. The Memory Machine**

A scientist creates a machine that can perfectly and painlessly erase one specific memory from your mind. Your spouse has just cheated on you, and the pain is destroying your life and your relationship. They are genuinely remorseful and swear it will never happen again. They beg you to use the machine so you can both move on and be happy, effectively resetting your relationship to the moment before the infidelity. What do you do?

* **A) The Purist of Pain:** You refuse. You believe that memories, good and bad, make you who you are. You would rather live in the agony of truth than in a blissful, manufactured lie. You choose to let the relationship either die honestly or survive with a real, ugly scar.
* **B) The Blissful Ignoramus:** You use the machine without a second thought. The pain is gone, the memory is gone, and your relationship is ""perfect"" again. You have chosen happiness over truth, outsourcing your emotional resilience to a fucking machine.
* **C) The Diabolical Twist:** You agree to use the machine... but instead of erasing your memory of the event, you secretly have the scientist erase *their* memory of the event. They now live with a vague, free-floating guilt they can't place, and you hold all the cards, forever.
* **D) The Mutually Assured Destruction:** You propose a deal. You'll both use the machine to erase the memory, but first, you get a ""free pass"" to go cheat on them. Once you're even, you'll both erase the memories of both affairs and start fresh. It's not about forgiveness; it's about petty, scorched-earth revenge.

**9. The Politician's Brain**

You are a world-class neurosurgeon. The leading presidential candidate, a populist demagogue you despise and believe will be a catastrophe for the nation, is rushed to your hospital with a life-threatening brain aneurysm. You are the only surgeon in the country skilled enough to perform the incredibly delicate surgery required to save his life. During the procedure, you realize you have a choice. You can save his life perfectly, or you can make a ""tiny, undetectable surgical error"" that will leave his cognitive functions intact but permanently change his personality, making him pathologically kind, empathetic, and compassionate. He would certainly lose the election but become a wonderful human being. Nobody would ever know it was you.

* **A) The Hippocratic Shill:** You perform your duty flawlessly. You save his life, he gets elected, and he proceeds to run the country into the ground, just as you predicted. But hey, at least you upheld your fucking oath.
* **B) The Benevolent Lobotomist:** You make the ""error."" You sacrifice your professional ethics for what you believe is the greater good, unilaterally deciding the fate of a nation and robbing a man of his identity to turn him into someone you find more palatable.
* **C) The Coward's Half-Measure:** You perform the surgery, but you ""accidentally"" leave him with a slight, persistent stutter. It doesn't change who he is, but you hope it's enough to make him look weak in the debates and cost him the election. You try to change the world but can only commit to a petty, ineffectual act.
* **D) The ""Oops"" Moment:** You ""accidentally"" let your scalpel slip. Whoops. He's dead. Problem solved. It was a very, very difficult surgery, after all. You'll be hailed as a tragic hero who did everything you could.

**10. The Last Panda**

It's the future. You're a zookeeper in charge of the last two giant pandas on Earth, a male and a female. All attempts at natural and artificial insemination have failed. A brilliant geneticist discovers a solution: a serum that will guarantee a successful pregnancy. The catch? The serum's primary active ingredient can only be synthesized from the bone marrow of a healthy, living snow leopard. There is only one snow leopard left in your zoo. To save the panda species, you must kill the last snow leopard. What the fuck do you do?

* **A) The Conservationist Paralysis:** You can't bring yourself to sacrifice one endangered species for another. You do nothing. Both the pandas and the snow leopard eventually die of old age, and you go down in history as the zookeeper who oversaw two extinctions because you were a fucking coward.
* **B) The Cute and Fluffy Calculus:** You kill the snow leopard. Pandas are cuter, more popular, and bring in more donation money. It's a brutal but simple cost-benefit analysis based on marketability and public appeal. Sorry, Spots.
* **C) The Public Relations Play:** You stage a massive, international media event around the ""impossible choice."" You create a global telethon, ""Pandas or Leopard?"", letting the world vote and donate. You don't make the choice; you monetize the dilemma and let the mob decide, absolving yourself of all responsibility while raking in cash for the zoo.
* **D) The Culinary Solution:** You kill the snow leopard and make the serum. But, hey, waste not, want not. You serve the rest of the leopard meat at the zoo's exclusive, high-roller fundraising gala, marketing it as the ""most exclusive meal in human history."" You solve the problem, make a profit, and are a goddamn legend in the world of fucked-up gastronomy.

i dont know what to do, i like this guy (lets call him J) a lot, but does this man even like me?

Positive things he did:

* He **looks at me consistently** when we're in a group, even when im not talking. He observes my reactions.
* **He walked me home** on my first night at my new apartment even though his house was way closer.
* He helped me **find and move into that apartment**, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (im a foreigner and dont speak the local language that well), and used his car to move my stuff.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a **photo I took of him** and called it the best picture he has.
* He **cut my steak** during a meal when i just offered him a bite. When a friend pointed out that hes too nice to me, and thats why she thought he likes me, J just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. And he asked who else thinks that.
* He pays attention to the things i do or do not like. and he **proudly points out** that he remembers whenever its brought up
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and i played along, J got **panicked and defensive**. J has done that a lot lately too, he's becoming more **worried** about me misinterpreting things concerning him.
* J and I were walking back to the office as another guy approached us and asked to talk to me alone, **J just left to go to his desk**. the guy then asked for my number, saying that he always sees me around. after the guy left, i saw J was at his desk with his headphones on, when i went to his desk they were half off his ears, he wasnt listening to anything on them. I asked him why he left me, and told him the guy made me uncomfortable. J's face looked shocked and shaky (i cant explain but it looked like he was suprised and scared, kind of how i look like when my heart drops). He had no clue. Then he called the guy creepy, and went outside to look for him and see if he was still there. When we walked back in, J told me ""wow youre so popular"" and as he was walking back to his desk, J bumped into the partition and dropped his umbrella and we laughed about it from across the room. 
* When J's friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at **me and smiled and tilted his head** as if asking ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""
* **- J's friends are lowkey in on it**, i feel like:
   * One made space for J to sit next to me, standing outside the booth until J came and sat next to me, even though his friend is also my friend and could've sat next to me himself. that same friend also makes me sit in the passenger seat when J is driving in his car.
   * Another friend left us alone, smiling, while we were talking, even though he had just sat down.
   * His friend complained to me, in front of J, about how J tends to space out his relationships by a year. His last relationship was almost 5/6 months ago. His friend then asked me if that makes sense.
* He only asked me for lunch with his friend, which his friend pointed out when we met him 

Signs he may not like me:

* He’s **deflected my invitation** to go walk by the river **twice**, first time he was hungover and sick, second time he said he had work, even though the second time he expressed wanting to go to the beach with everyone (but they refused because its finals week and the beach is far). 
* J asked me why i liked the river, and when i asked why he doesn't, he said the river **isn’t special** to him because he’s lived nearby for 30 years—but didn’t try to offer an alternative way to spend time.
* He showed **no visible jealousy** when other the other guy asked to talk to me alone—only commented after the fact and acted like he had no clue that this is what the guy was up to.
* He’s never followed up with **his own invitations** or taken initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another to grab coffee.",1,1749385511.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,0.67,False

So, I worked at this garage for about a year. My boss was a micromanager to the extreme. One day, he yells at me for not tightening a lug nut “the way he does it,” even though the car was totally fine.

Fed up, I asked, “You want me to do everything exactly the way you do it?”

He goes, “Yes. EXACTLY how I do it. Got it?”

Cool. Next day, I come in wearing sunglasses inside, sipping black coffee, and I ignore every customer like he does. When someone asked for help, I said, “I don’t do that—ask the front desk.”

By lunch, I had parked in his reserved spot, took his lunch out of the fridge, and told a guy he needed four new tires even though he came in for an oil change—just like I’d watched my boss do last week.

An hour later, I got fired. Not for being rude, or for bad work.
I got fired for “mocking management.”

Guess he didn’t like seeing himself in the mirror.

I’m in the back doing dishes when all of a sudden I hear yelling. It’s after hours so nobody should be inside but my (not okay in the head) supervisor somehow let our barista’s famously abusive boyfriend in and he started hitting her. Anyways, I run in to yell at him and since I’m the only other dude in the establishment, he starts squaring me up. He does that stupid thing people trying to intimidate others do where he gets his face as close to mine as possible. Welp, he’s intoxicated so he ended up getting so close that he accidentally touched his lips onto mine. I respond with “bro did you just kiss me? I thought you were mad at me?” That really pissed him off so now he’s swinging at me. He’s hella drunk and I’m high so I felt like Spider-Man dodging his punches. Eventually, I knew if I didn’t do something, I’d get hurt. I really didn’t want to fight back because I know in LA you can get punished for defending yourself (gross but fun city so visit, just don’t live there) but finally I just had to end the fight. I knocked him out after two awkward swings and two gnarly punches right on the nose. Watched his stupid broccoli haircut bounce on the floor and the cops came to arrest him. 

Bad news, she’s still with him… low lives…

Good news, the district manager never bothered to get a security camera pointing at the only blind spot of the lobby so I’m like “I didn’t punch I just put my hands up to block the punches and his drunk ah fell by himself…” 😂😂😂 I got two weeks off PAID and my recovery doctor visits was all covered by the siren. 

I currently work a salary job that’s in the field I actually went to college for. I love it and get to be creative for a living so yay 😭 happy ending




SIDE NOTE: 
To the baristas that appreciate their job and every day try to make the vibes good with positivity, I love you, I want the best for you, you deserve better.

To the baristas that somehow think they’re better than others, judge fellow coworkers, ostracize free thinkers, and make the place even more miserable than it has to be I would just like to say, you DON’T deserve better, you deserve to stay in limbo and literally make coffee for people you hate. It’s why you’re stuck there and it’s why you’re sour to others. It’s crazy what people tell themselves to feel better about their current situation. You’re losers and I wish the good ones didn’t have to see you every week along with the customers whose brains are constantly getting worse because of how severe we are dwindling as a society.  I don’t care what your excuse is, please get a LIFE outside of the company. Please have hobbies, please CREATE things. Please actually look into small ways you can contribute to society because it’ll help you prioritize things differently and you’ll be a better person from the core, from within, from the heart. Or just quit and make lives worse somewhere else like 7/11 or something, it’s the same experience requirements you need to get the job you currently have. None.

I want places that are twice as good as those fake fancy places for half the price. If it's a cafe comfy enough to sit down and work then even better but I'll take any joint that serves great food at an affordable enough price for me to want to be a regular.

I figure if everyone contributes their findings then it will help guys eat well on a reasonable budget and support these places that keep prices affordable.

So I thought I’d share it with you all and spread my joy, as I’m practically still gushing thinking about it.

My girl and I first met in a book shop last year purely by chance. This random beauty struck up a conversation with me about the book I had picked up. This turned into a long conversation about books and authors, and me staring at her, mesmerised by how stunning she was. But I had no idea if she was gay or if I was her type. And when she very casually leaned in and fixed my lipstick with her thumb, it became crystal clear and left me weak in my knees. I was just the ditsy girl in her sundress and a fringe, and this angel disarmed me with quiet confidence. We exchanged numbers that day and set a date.

On our first date, we got some coffee, spent hours at the same book shop where we met, followed by dinner and a very, very long walk along the river. We held hands and talked nonsense all the way, and at one point she asked, “Would it be okay if I kissed you?”🥹

I melted on the spot. Being asked that question felt incredibly romantic. The hotness and warmth in consent is seriously underrated. I nodded my head and we kissed each other’s lips, softly, many, many times. And then she just looked at me, hands on the side of my waist and asked, “Still with me?” I just gave her a smile and looked at her lips, and she went for it. She pulled me in close, one hand on my lower back and the other on my shoulder blades like she was anchoring me to the spot, and it was a deep, intense, passionate kiss that seemed to never end, and I didn’t want it to either.

Needless to say our next date was literally a week later, and we’ve been together ever since.

That date was one for the ages, and we celebrate one year of love in the next two weeks! She’s from Spain and I’m English, and every time she speaks to me in soft Spanish words that I don’t fully understand, I melt into her arms!🥰",2,1749384742.0,happy,1,1.0,False
