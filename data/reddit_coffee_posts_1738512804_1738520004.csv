I'm over 50. I worked a job I hated for 30 years while all my friends were working at record stores, coffee shops, on tour, etc. I retired 3 years ago and still work a job I don't like, mostly to fund my studio goals and set myself up to enjoy what I do without the worry of needing to generate a sustainable income from it (because who can anymore?).

I drive an old car with 200K miles on it. I do not have a bass boat, hunting club membership, golf cart, 4-wheeler, sports car, or any of the other mid-age-crisis vices. My wife works full-time and doesn't break 40K. We live in an old neighborhood near a lot of crime, are fairly frugal, but do ok. We also don't have kids (so that's a perk). The only extravagance (if you can call it that) is the gear in my home studio.

By modern studio standards, mine is very humble. I have a really nice set of monitors, a rack full of common outboard gear, and a good mic collection. I have guitars and amps (some mine, some were my dad's, RIP), a drum kit, an open reel recorder, pedals, and that's about it. I built my bass traps and acoustic treatment, learned to solder and DIY'd as much as possible. I purchased my first 4-track cassette recorder in 1992 and have worked at this every chance I could since then (just didn't run out and buy all this shit overnight).

I never expected to make a dime off of this, become a ""known"" engineer, or anything. I only wanted to participate and help others record their music.

Now that my ""studio"" is *kinda* legit, It seems like whenever anyone comes over, I get/feel a lot of negativity. I've experienced everything from passive-aggressive remarks to full-on insults. People my age that stop by say things like ""it must be nice..."", I guess if I had your money I could..."", ""I'll never be able to afford a...."" And shit like that. I had an old bandmate friend (who I recorded for free) look up the cost of one of my preamps he enjoyed, and he literally got angry with me. I had someone from a college band I recorded (for free) walk around with his head hung low because he ""will never be able to get a blah, blah, blah."" And then he got pissed when his recordings ""didn't sound like Weezer's blue album we talked about."" These kids didn't even know their own songs, let alone play like Weezer. Yet it's my fault. I've had people actually ask me if I could disassemble everything I own, set it up at their practice space, and let them ""borrow it for a while."" Didn't even want me involved, just wanted my toys.

When non-music people come over, they're confused: ""So, are you trying to be, like, famous at your age? What did that cost? and that? So if I were to get one of those, what would it cost? So what would it take to get a band like Smashing Pumkins to record here?"" ""NO CRAIG, YOU ASSHOLE. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO WIMBLETON? THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL THOSE TENNIS RACKETS AND GO TO THE CLUBHOUSE EVERY SATURDAY? WHY DON'T YOU AN MARGO HAVE SOME MORE FUCKING KIDS?""

When I was in bands in the 90's, we used to drive hundreds of miles just to record in places we only heard about word of mouth. They didn't have near the capabilities we have now. We were SO stoked and SO appreciative to be in those places. Never did any of us walk around in self-pity pointing at gear and saying shit like ""Muuhhh... I guess I'll never have an amp like that. Muhhhh... it must be nice...""

People don't understand the countless hours I've spent reading and studying about this stuff. They don't know how many nights I stayed up until the sun came up just listening to a kick drum over and over while they were out impregnating last-call bar flies. Or the consistent early mornings I was at a job they were too cool to work (and made fun of me for) while they slept in. Not to mention the recording school that totally ripped me off in 2002.

Perhaps I've aged out already. I still feel exactly like the same person I was at 16, but I'm not. These days, I keep the studio door closed when people come over. When my wife asks me to show someone my room, I make an excuse not to. When people ask about recording, I make an excuse about something being broke or it not being a good time right now. I still enjoy sitting in here by myself, listening to music, fiddling with knobs and faders.  I'm still thankful. And it is nice, but would be a lot nicer if I could share it with others. Oh well.

1ig3fwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ig3fwx/keurig_kduo_plus_single_serve_carafe_coffee_maker/,Keurig K-Duo Plus Single Serve & Carafe Coffee Maker review. Test passed?,"The Keurig K-Duo Plus (model K-Duo Plus) has been my go-to coffee maker for the past couple of months, and let me tell you, it’s quite the multitasker. As someone who enjoys the convenience of a single-serve coffee and occasionally hosting guests with a full carafe, this machine has become an essential part of my daily life. Still, while it’s a fantastic brewer, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

The design immediately stood out. It’s sleek, compact, and fits perfectly into my kitchen without hogging counter space. The multi-position 60oz water reservoir is a genius feature—it can be moved to the left, right, or back, depending on your setup. This flexibility makes it adaptable for different kitchen layouts. The materials feel sturdy, and the black finish adds a modern, minimalistic vibe.

Brewing performance is impressive. Whether I’m prepping a single cup or a full 12-cup carafe, the process is smooth and relatively quick. The Strong Brew option is a lifesaver on groggy mornings, delivering a bold and punchy cup of coffee. I’ve noticed that the carafe keeps coffee warm for the promised two hours, although it’s more “warm” than “hot” after the first hour.

Curious about Keurig K-Duo Plus pricing? [Check Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/keurig-k-duo-plus-coffee-maker-review-b07p5w3j29/)

**Coffee Flavor**  
I’m pretty picky when it comes to coffee, and the K-Duo Plus hasn’t disappointed. Using ground coffee in the carafe option, the flavor comes through robust and well-balanced. With K-Cups, the taste is consistent, though it’s worth noting that flavor depth can vary depending on the brand of pods you use. The Strong Brew really does elevate the intensity, which is great for espresso-style lovers.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning this machine is a breeze, which is a massive bonus for someone like me who dreads post-coffee cleanup. The removable drip tray accommodates taller mugs and makes spills easy to manage. The gold reusable filter for ground coffee is a nice touch, eliminating the need for disposable filters. However, you’ll want to clean the single-serve coffee channel regularly, as coffee oils can build up over time.

**Pros**

* Compact and sleek design saves counter space.
* Multi-position water reservoir for flexible placement.
* Strong Brew option delivers bold, intense coffee.
* Dual functionality: single-serve and carafe options.
* Easy-to-clean components, including a reusable gold filter.

**Cons**

* Coffee in the carafe is warm, not hot, after the first hour.
* Single-serve brew can cause slight splattering due to dispenser height.
* No adjustable water temperature settings.
* The machine is slightly loud during operation.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When stacked up against competitors like the Ninja DualBrew Pro and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Keurig K-Duo Plus holds its own. The Ninja offers a similar dual-functionality with more customizable brew temperatures, but it’s bulkier and takes up more counter space. The Hamilton Beach model is more affordable, yet its build quality doesn’t feel as premium, and it lacks the sleek design and flexibility of the K-Duo Plus. If aesthetics and compactness are priorities, the Keurig is a clear winner.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
The Keurig K-Duo Plus comes in at a mid-tier price point, and for what it offers, I’d say it’s worth the investment. Its versatility, along with its space-saving design, makes it a great value for those who want the convenience of both single-serve and carafe brewing without cluttering their kitchen. Similar machines with fewer features are often priced similarly, so this model feels like a step up in terms of functionality and style.

**Features in Use**  
The programmable auto-brew is a lifesaver on busy mornings. I set it the night before, and voila—fresh coffee greets me when I wake up. The Pause & Pour feature is another gem, allowing me to sneak a cup mid-brew without spills. The Strong Brew option works for both single cups and carafes, giving me control over the coffee’s intensity. The Smart Start feature is great too, as it heats and brews in one seamless process, saving me those extra “waiting for it to heat” moments.

Overall, the Keurig K-Duo Plus is a versatile, efficient coffee maker that caters to a variety of needs, from single-serve convenience to entertaining a crowd. While it’s not perfect, its pros far outweigh its cons, and it’s become an integral part of my caffeine-fueled routine.

If I could take the easy way out a la GTAV mode, I would’ve right there 

I can only describe it as a drunkNstoned moment of frustration in aftermath, but I started several CH survival runs, trying to get to Quonset Garage to see if Barb’s rifle would spawn next to the locker again. The game laughed in my face, and belligerent thinking thought that turning off cougars/scurvy was increasing the difficulty ‘and limited resources. I just wanted a gun or a hatchet, maybe a prybar or hacksaw from the jump to help me get a new run rolling…

And then I remembered my PV run, sitting right there in the save files at 55 days… I didn’t wanna stop playing TLD on a bad note so I loaded in, and I remember why I stopped playing this run: I had gotten cabin fever after arriving at the Community Hall during a blizzard — I was encumbered and it was all fine and good until the Aurora hit on my walk back to the farmstead (fuuuuck)

I stopped at the barn and made a bunch of coffee. couldn’t pass the time indoors, so I nervously waited for it to finish cooking, and then I took the most anxious walk to base I’ve ever had in-game. I avoid the Aurora nights like the plague, so I was terrified. I made it to the farmhouse without incident, but then I still had to deal with cabin fever. For the first time sleeping outside on this run, I repeatedly slept in 4 one hour intervals, praying the fires by the outdoor porch wouldn’t go out. 

Cabin fever has gone away, and I’m feeling incredibly relieved, but I’m ready to say screw PV and go back to ML for the time being; I am not prepared for a trip to TWM, and I have a decent loadout of clothes, ammo, weapons, and gear that I’d like to save. 

The goal is to go back to ML for a day, venture through FM to BR, and I’m hoping to encounter a cutscene or whatever to unlock this fahkin Far Territory DLC ",1,1738519793.0,thelongdark,0,1.0,False

i want to work out and eat better. currently i eat mostly 2 meals a day with snacks in between. don't drink alot of sugary or gassy drinks either, maybe like 1-2 a month (but i love coffee - usually get it without sugar but with milk). sometimes junk food like chips but it's pretty rare. maybe like 1-2 in 2 weeks only. chocolates rare too, like once every 1-2 weeks. i usually eat rice for lunch with protein and vege (i always try to eat more vege than rice & protein, following that general 1-2-3 rule where 1-carbs, 2-protein, 3-veges) and usually stay away from eating rice at night (sometimes i do tho. it's hard, i'm asian and i live either with parents or in college where i can't cook for myself.)

as for working out, i currently live in college and do a lot of walking, but there are some days that i'm kind of stagnant and don't do much. but i try my best to get some walking in. i do wish to go to the gym soon and will probably start going to the gym around mid-feb. 

1 thing i'm scared of is saggy skin. i would say my arms are big and my tummy is big. i have bigger boobs too which i love and cherish lmao and wouldn't want to lose that. i don't want to lose a ton of weight, just tone down my tummy and arms and kind of gain muscle. there's no ""inch"" or set amount i want to set as a goal. just to feel good in my body and with how i look like.

1ig3ebg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1ig3ebg/i_am_so_tired_of_constant_lung_pain/,I am so tired of constant lung pain,"I started smoking cigarettes at 15. From 16-21 I was doing a lot of psychedelics. Acid made me want to chainsmoke, so I would, but after a few trips, I started to become disgusted with the taste and feeling. So, at 21, I switched to vapes. 

When I was 19, I worked at a Cafe inside an outpatient hospital, right before covid, and a nurse/friend offered to listen to my lungs for me. She said my right lung sounded like it was struggling/stunted. I have had what I believe to be chronic pleurisy since I was a kid- it's a sudden, sharp pain in different areas in my chest/back/ribcage that gets increasingly more painful with inhale/exhales, or if I move too quickly. 

When I switched from cigs, I was only using Vuse menthol pods, so the taste wouldn't be enticing to me. I felt slightly better with not stinking like cigarettes or having the taste in my mouth, and I stopped coughing up gross phlegm. But vaping seems to have exacerbated the habit- the only time I've gone without was a morning where I had to walk to go get pods- and I legitimately couldn't stop myself from angry sobbing that I didn't have my morning hit. Hell, I didn't even get through writing this post without a hit. 

I'm 25 now, and live over the road, so I use a vaporesso mod + flavored juice. It's an expensive habit, and my lung pain still persists. Last December I wanted to hike Mt. Erie in WA for my birthday. I'm from a state with completely flat terrain, so idk if it was a combo of the elevation + cold air or what- but I legitimately could not fucking breathe. There were literally elderly people breezing past me as I sat on logs every 5 minutes because I was so lightheaded, and struggling. I don't even have asthma. 

In March, I'll be joining a program that's going to require me to hike/backpack through front+back country with over 40 lbs of tools and supplies. I already have a fucked up knee that's making me worried about my ability to pull this off. I don't want to be struggling to breathe on top of that, or having horrible lung pain while doing a risky task. I'm allowed to smoke on 15 min breaks, or just use patches.

I'm thinking of attempting to quit now while I have the space and ability to be a huge bitch without affecting my future crew members. I have absolutely no doubt that I'm gonna be an emotional, raging asshole. But I don't want to be in pain anymore. I don't want to be 25 and already feeling like my body is giving out on me. I want to fucking *breathe*. 

The oral fixation/inhale-exhale is a big issue for me. And I have a lot of routine triggers. Just ate? Smoke. Just woke up? Smoke. Went outside? Smoke. Had sex? Smoke. Cleaned something? Smoke. Drank coffee? Smoke. It's been 10 minutes? Smoke. Quitting feels so daunting and impossible to do because of this. The only silver lining I have is that I've smoked w33d obsessively for the same amount of time as nicotine, yet have successfully stopped (for the program I mentioned) with minimal cravings. 

Should I double up on patches and a nicotine gum? How soon can I expect to breathe better? And does anyone else experience chronic pleurisy? I don't expect quitting to get rid of it, I've experienced it all my life even before smoking. But I'm sure as hell that it isn't helping. I'm sorry this is so long. I'm like scared to even say the words ""I want to quit"" out loud because then my partner will hold me accountable for it, and my brain just does NOT want to stop. Any advice or tips are greatly appreciated. I think I'm gonna get some patches and start quitting tomorrow. ",2,1738519719.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

Attributing everything under the sun to not drinking enough water. ""Heres a reminder to drink more waterrrrr.""

People completely discount the fact that you get a lot of water from food, especially if you eat fruits and vegetables. Also discounted is both your natural feeling of thirst and the feedback when you go to the bathroom. If both of these are good, and you don't have plans to be out in the blazing heat, working out/extra activity, or both, you don't need to forcibly suck down extra water. People toting around big barrel looking water thermoses like in March when it's not even hot and they sit in an office. the fuck are you doing? I get if it's just pleasurable but they think they are making great strides in health.  

People also discount water from other beverages. Milk is mostly water. Soda....believe it or not is mostly hydrating. Even coffee is net hydrating, although not nearly as effective as other options. The only thing that is net dehydrating is alcoholic beverages. 

Also, the recommendations for how much to drink dont make sense. In reality its directly related to size and activity level but you see all the time something like a full gallon recommended. I am an over 200 lb male and a gallon is way too much. It's distracting because it keeps me in the bathroom pissing all the time. The fact this is also recommended to someone like a 115 lb woman is ridiculous. 

If you are not thirsty, and your piss is not dark, you are good. If you want a little bump in hydration for skin or whatever drink two extra glasses of water. You don't need a gallon or half gallon.

1ig3c7q,https://i.redd.it/gsdfdmy8nrge1.jpeg,Old World vs New World: ‘04 Margaux vs ‘16 Harlan,"Last night we enjoyed both of these delightful wines side by side. The clear winner from all 4 of us was: The Harlan! 

For the Margaux, the nose was surprisingly floral with a hint of spices even after two hours of decanting. The palate was admittedly a little bland, with almost no presence of the big black fruits you’d expect and instead almost entirely dark chocolate, cedar, herbs, and leather. It did pair nicely with chicken. 

But the Harlan was the belle of the ball. The 2016 vintage is known as a banner year and this wine got 100pt ratings across the board. It shows. The nose is incredibly bold fruit with hints of truffle and forest. The palate is still a strong showing of dark fruits but with some coffee/mocha finish. The texture was like velvet. I think all of 4 of us literally said “oh wow” after our first taste. 

I bought both wines at auction from K&L ($500 for Margaux and $1,150 for Harlan) and both were stored in my underground cellar in California. I’m scheduled to visit Harlan in March and will share my experience!

Initially, she seemed receptive enough, even playfully teasing me. I knew she had to meet up with friends, but I think she cut the date short. Ended up just being under an hour and I think initially she said we had 90mins. Should have I made a move on her? She sat us down on a bench pretty soon after we started walking for some reason, spent 10min there then carried on. Maybe she got cold feet because I didn’t put my arm around her or something?

Sundry – What started as a quiet coffee shop in this rural town has become an unlikely stage for local musicians, drawing visitors from miles around to experience live music in the heart of Sundry.

June’s Café & Bakery, a family-owned business that opened six years ago, originally served as a cozy spot for coffee and homemade pastries. But when owner June Thompson allowed a group of high school students to play acoustic music on a slow Friday night last fall, she never expected what would happen next.

“The place was packed within an hour,” Thompson recalled with a laugh. “People heard music coming from the café and just started showing up. It was like the whole town wanted to be part of it.”

Since then, June’s Café & Bakery has hosted live music every Friday night, featuring a mix of country, folk, and bluegrass artists—many of them local farmers, teachers, and students who never had a stage before.

“I’ve played guitar by myself for years, but I never thought I’d perform for a crowd,” said farmer Bill Hendricks, who has become a regular performer. “Now I get to share my music, and folks seem to really enjoy it.”

Word has spread beyond Sundry, bringing in musicians and music lovers from nearby towns. Some weekends, the café even has to bring in extra chairs to accommodate the crowd.

Local business owners are also seeing a boost. The town’s only motel, The Hospitality Inn, has reported an uptick in overnight guests on music nights, and the local general store owner, Sam Wilkes, says he’s selling more snacks and drinks to concertgoers. 

Mayor Tom Waverly praised the café for bringing new life to the town. “Sundry has always been a quaint and quiet place, but this little café has given us something special—a reason to come together and celebrate who we are,” he said.

With no plans to stop the tradition anytime soon, Thompson says she’s just happy to see her café bringing joy to the town. “Music has a way of connecting people,” she said. “And in a small town like this, that connection means everything.”

Mid-range pricing (salad bar only option is $29.95, full dinner - salad bar and meats - is $48.95). Both options are unlimited. Salad bar, you fix your own plate; meats are brought to your table and cut plate side (we have 15-20 cuts of beef, pork, chicken, lamb, fish and seafood, depending on the time of year). 

We’re running a special on Sundays in February where we open at 12 instead of 4, and pricing for full meal is $34.95 instead of $48.95.  Otherwise we open at 4pm. 

It’s slow in the restaurant right now. Everyone is hopped up on family meal, coffee and donuts, and bored with just a few tables so far, which isn’t uncommon early in the shift. It’s a heavy meal for middle of the day. 

My area is smack dab in the middle of the restaurant.  I’m reading a book, and look up to everyone running from the dish pit gagging, and our resident back of house prankster following behind laughing.

I could use some help! [Breville Dual Boiler / DF64],"Yesterday I pulled what I would consider one of the best tasting shots of espresso I've had. My grind setting was at \`15\` on the DF64.

Back up to \`15\`, finally some flow, but it still took very long, and it looked uneven. Didn't taste great, but it was drinkable, and I wasn't about to throw out another puck.

1ig35zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ig35zm/i_moved_into_a_cult_town_pt_2/,I Moved Into A Cult Town Pt 2,"Rushing down the stairs with an almost terrifying pace, I put back on my shoes, medal still in hand. I fumbled with the door in anger, waking the family. Mary had gotten to the bottom of the stairs before I flung the door open, calling out to me. I marched over to Gary’s house, practically banging on the door. It shouldn’t take him too long to answer. However, it was Isaac who opened the door, with his cold, blue eyes staring back at me. *Of course, the little shit already knows.* 

*“You left a fucking Nazi medal in my goddamned house?!”* I screamed, my voice raw with rage. 

Mary, who had been running after to get my attention, froze in place.

The boy in front of me barely flinched. Instead, he scoffed, his voice laced with vitriol. *“Wrong name, d-.”* 

Before he could continue, I swung across his cheek, and he crumpled to the ground. I shook off my hand, my knuckles stinging from the impact.

*“Stay the fuck away from my kids. I know what you are.”* 

A sudden movement made me turn. Gary had rushed down downstairs, a handgun gripped loosely in his hands. He lifted it, hesitation clear in his stance, before recognition flickered in his eyes. He realized it was me.

I was already backed onto the porch, my hands raising in surrender.

His expression hardened. Back to his facade. *“Get out of my house, neighbor.”* 

For a moment, I stared at him expectantly, wanting him to do *something* about his son, but he slowly shook his head, moving towards the door to shut and lock it.

I kicked the staircase railing in anger, shaking my head and turning toward my own house. But I didn’t get far.

*“You just moved in and already overstayed your welcome.”* 

An old woman stood a few feet ahead, her face deceptively kind, but her words dripped with bitter venom.

*“People like you ruin everything,”* she sneered. *“Your family is nothing but disgusting, violent pigs.”* 

Behind her, other doors creaked open. Porch lights flickered on, illuminating the street like a stage. Even further outside our little cul-de-sac, more people filed out of their homes. One by one, neighbors shuffled out in their robes and slippers, their tired eyes brimming with something darker than exhaustion. 

And then, they moved. Slowly, at first, then with purpose, closing in. 

On us.

*“Get the hell away from us, you creepy motherfuckers!”* I shrieked, as they surrounded us in a crowd. It was like we shook a nest of hornets, how they all flocked to swarm us as quickly as I hit Isaac.

At first, they shouted and spat insults, hurling every slur and vile name they could think of. But then, their heckling began to shift, merging into something akin to what I heard back at the church.

It started as a low murmur, crawling under my skin, insidious and unnatural.

*“You’re next. You’re next. You’re next.”* 

The words swelled, rising into a full-throated chant, echoing throughout the neighboorhood and rattling my skull. 

Some of them were overtaken in religious fervor, their porcelain white skin flushed red, veins bulging, froth bubbling at the corners of their mouths. Others swayed where they stood, like drug addicts.

Mary and the kids huddled close to me. I wrapped them as best I could. 

We edged sideways, pushing toward our house. I shoved past a few of them, ignoring their glazed-over stares, until we finally slipped inside. As I slammed the door shut, the crowd turned in unison, their empty eyes following us.

I dragged a heavy shelf in front of the door, bracing it against whatever might come next.

Jamie wailed, his cries piercing through the thick tension in the room. Miriam clung to Mary, burying her face in her mother’s side.

*“Are we going to die?”* she asked, her voice trembling, body shaking with fear.

Mary stroked her hair, her voice soft but steady. *“No, baby. Mommy and Daddy are going to protect you and your brother.”* She held her close, whispering reassurances in her ear.

I stepped forward and scooped Jamie into my arms, rubbing his back in slow, gentle circles—the one thing that had always calmed him down. I rocked him, whispering quiet shushes, my own throat tightening.

For a moment, tears burned in my eyes. But I forced them back. I had to be strong for them.

*“Daddy’s going to sit right here and keep y’all safe,”* I said, my voice firm. *“I need you to go upstairs, lock the bedroom door, and stay quiet. No matter what.”*

Mary hesitated, her lips parting as if to argue. But then, she just nodded.

*“Come on,”* she whispered to the kids, holding out her arms.

I handed Jamie over, now silent but clutching her shirt with tiny fists. Mary ushered Miriam upstairs, glancing back at me only once before disappearing down the hall.

I turned away and walked to the kitchen, grabbing the largest knife I could find.

Then, I dragged a chair across the wooden floor, the sound grating against my ears, and positioned it a few feet from the front door.

And I sat.

The alcohol that had clouded my judgment earlier had mostly worn off, replaced by something far worse—primal, bone-deep fear.

For hours, we were at their mercy.





At some point, exhaustion won. My head drooped, and I drifted off.

When the first light of dawn crept through the blinds, I jolted awake, momentarily blinded. My heart pounded as I checked the time. **6 AM.**

I stumbled out of the chair and rushed to the windows. Then the garage. Then the back door. No signs of forced entry. No footprints in the dewy grass.

Upstairs, I found Mary and the kids still curled up together, finally asleep.

I exhaled, tension loosening in my chest. But my relief was short-lived.

Something had to be done about those bastards.

I took a cold shower, letting the icy water jolt me fully awake. Then, I threw on a T-shirt, sweatpants, and my running sneakers. I grabbed my wallet and keys, checked every lock, and stepped outside.

The neighborhood was silent again.

They must have left sometime after I dozed off. But why?

Had they marked me for purging?

I wouldn’t know for sure until Sunday.

**It was Tuesday.**

Five days until the next procession. Five days to prepare.

First, I needed answers.

Why did Isaac bring a KKK medallion into my house? I knew there was racism here, but this?

This was something else.

Something worse.

It was like living in a goddamn horror movie, like fucking *Get Out.*

I kept a steady jog, head down, though I knew it wouldn’t do much. As I left the neighborhood, the world around suddenly whirred to life. Cars rushing past, people walking their dogs, voices carrying over phone calls.

A few glanced my way, their expressions unreadable, though some almost looked... *sorry for me.* I ignored it and pressed on.

By the time I reached the pier, it was already bustling with life. Fishermen cast their lines into the lake, families lingered along the docks, and boats drifted in the distance. I slowed to catch my breath, my body reminding me I wasn’t as young as I used to be. Still, I had run far enough to feel accomplished.

My car was right where I had left it. I rounded the hood, pulling out my keys—then stopped.

Something was tucked under the windshield wiper.

**Shit.**

Expecting a parking ticket, I snatched it up. But it wasn’t a citation—it was a crumpled scrap of paper, creased and worn like it had been balled up and smoothed out again.

There was only one thing written on it.

An address.

No name. No explanation. Just a destination.

Frowning, I pulled out my phone and punched the address into Maps. It led to a library about ten miles away.

I sighed. This was going to take up my whole day.

Without a second thought, I called in sick to work. It’d put me in hot water, but my family’s safety came first.

Before getting in, I did a full sweep—checked the trunk, the back seat, even under the seats. No signs of anything stolen. No signs of anything *planted.*

Satisfied, I slid behind the wheel, started the engine, and headed for the library.





When I arrived, I double-checked the address, unsure if I was in the right place.

The building loomed before me, its architecture ancient and imposing—much like the church, though with a more scholarly air, something straight out of *Harry Potter.*

I stepped out of the car and took a closer look. The towering stone structure had an old-world charm, its massive wooden doors worn but sturdy. Taking a deep breath, I pushed them open and peeked inside.

Warm lighting bathed the interior, casting a golden glow over the towering bookshelves and massive columns near the entrance. The air was thick with the scent of aged paper and ink, a musty but oddly comforting aroma.

Students from the nearby campus filled the space, some hunched over textbooks, others murmuring quietly among themselves.

As I took it all in, one of the receptionists waved me over.

*“Hi, do you need any help today?”*

She couldn’t have been older than twenty, her youthful features framed by a ponytail of ginger hair. Her oversized glasses looked a little too big for her face, giving her an almost bookish innocence.

*“Uh, yeah,”* I said, stepping closer. *“Do you have any books on the history of the nearby towns? Also, any news clippings from the town over.”*

She blinked. *“From how far back?”*

*“Well… as far back as possible. I’ll be here for a while, so I want to cover my bases.”*

She stared at me for a second before nodding.

*“We have records dating back to the 18th century.”* She turned to her computer, tapped a few keys, then gave me directions to the archives.

I thanked her and made my way deeper into the library, my pulse quickening.

If there were answers to be found, they’d be here.





I followed the receptionist’s directions, weaving through the towering bookshelves, keeping my gaze low as I passed clusters of students. The deeper I ventured, the quieter the library became, the hum of conversation fading into an eerie stillness.

At last, I reached a secluded section in the far back—a dimly lit archive room that felt more like an office than a library. Rows of meticulously organized file cabinets lined the walls, and shelves sagged under the weight of aging tomes and yellowed newspapers, neatly categorized by date.

Behind a worn wooden desk sat a lone librarian, flipping through a ledger. He was older than me, bald on top with wisps of gray at the sides, his reading glasses balanced precariously on the edge of his nose. He barely glanced up as I entered.

*“Help you with something?”* he rasped, his voice rough with age.

*“Yeah,”* I said, stepping closer. *“I’m looking for historical records on the town—anything strange. Unusual events, disappearances… hate groups. That sort of thing.”*

That made him pause. He looked at me, studying my face with a mix of curiosity and something else—caution, maybe—before nodding slowly.

*“We keep local newspapers and town records back here. Some of the older ones aren’t digitized, so you’ll have to go through them manually,”* he said, gesturing toward a heavy filing cabinet against the far wall. *“Start with those. The rest are in the microfilm room.”*

*“Thanks.”*

*“Hold on,”* he added, reaching into a nearby drawer. He pulled out a box of latex gloves and shook it lightly. *“You’ll want to use these.”*

I took a pair and slipped them on before moving to the cabinet. The drawer groaned as I pulled it open, releasing a stale, musty scent—the unmistakable aroma of old ink and decaying paper.

At first, the files contained the usual small-town history—construction projects, business openings, the occasional scandal.

But the deeper I dug, the more the stories began to shift:

**1915: Unexplained disappearances on the outskirts of town.**

**1928: Mass resignation of town officials—no reason given.**

**1936: Church congregation accused of “ritualistic practices.”**

**1952: Family of four vanished—house left untouched, food still on the table.**

A chill crept up my spine as I scanned the headlines, each one more unsettling than the last. Then, my eyes landed on a particular article, and my breath caught in my throat.

**""Local Businessman Found Dead in Apparent Suicide – Strange Symbol Engraved in Skull.""**

The date was recent. Eight years ago. 

Beneath the headline was a grainy black-and-white photo of the man’s lifeless body. Above and slightly-right to his temple was an intricate symbol carved deep into his skull. I had seen it before.

It was the same one I had seen on the Klan medallion in my house.

My fingers tightened around the brittle newspaper, sweat beading down my forehead. My pulse was pounding in my ears.

This wasn’t just about racism.

There was something much worse lurking in this town.

There was something else peculiar about the article. Every case mentioned a trail that went cold a few miles past the nearby railroad tracks. Clothes and dolls were often found scattered near the tracks, later identified by neighbors as belonging to the missing family of four. In the case of the businessman with the engraved skull, his body had been dumped in a ditch right beside the tracks. Even in the older articles, this trend was still prevalent with the clothes of the missing persons being torn and hung over the trees.

I took the article and walked over to the old librarian.

*“Do you have directions to the railroad tracks mentioned in this paper?”*

He glanced at the article, his expression shifting from curiosity to dread. His face went pale.

*“No, you don’t want to do that,”* he muttered.

So he knew.

*“There are people in danger,”* I pressed. *“I need to find out what the hell is happening in this town.”*

He exhaled sharply, shaking his head. *“You think you’re the first brave soul to go chasing ghosts? You’re dealing with something beyond you, beyond all of us.”*

*“I don’t have a choice,”* I said. *“Last night, people were chanting outside my front door. And I found a Klan medal in my house.”*

His eyes widened in disbelief. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed his forehead. *“Oh, God…”*

For a moment, he said nothing. Then, with a heavy sigh, he spoke.

*“If you go beyond the steel refinery, about a mile out, you’ll reach the train station. Follow the tracks past the river, and keep going. You’ll know when you get there.”* His voice dropped lower. *“I’m warning you—there’s something deeply wrong with that place. It’s taboo to even take pictures of it. Bring a friend with you, let your family know where you’re going.”*





His directions echoed in my mind as I drove home, my grip tightening on the wheel. I needed to prepare. My first thought was to bring Gary, but there was a chance Isaac was still keeping an eye on him. I mulled it over while gathering supplies—food, water, batteries, flashlights, and a small medical kit. I also grabbed a portable charger. If I was going to find proof, I needed to make sure I could document it. But who would I even show it to? Would the police even care?

At home, I kept my explanations brief. I told my family I was going hiking, avoiding any details that might make them suspicious. She chose not to press, but the kids begged to come along. I told them no, promising to bring back a cool rock instead. That was enough to satisfy them, making things easier.

Rather than meeting Gary in person, I called him.

*""I found something big. Are you free tomorrow morning?""*

He hesitated on the other end. *""Yeah. I’ll pick you up. Don’t tell me anything over the phone.""*

*""One more thing—bring hiking gear.""*

With that, I hung up.

That night, I cooked dinner for my family—burgers and fries, something simple but comforting. If this was the last time I saw them, I wanted to share a meal before stepping into the unknown.





**Wednesday.**

The next day arrived, and I met Gary outside our homes. He had a backpack slung over his shoulder, dressed in a short-sleeved flannel over a tee, paired with shorts and gray sneakers. I opted for a gray hoodie, shorts, and durable sneakers. He gave me a nod before tossing our gear into the trunk and climbing into the driver’s seat.

*""Is Isaac gonna know?""* I asked, my voice edged with concern.

*""No. As far as I can tell, he's not suspicious of me. You, though... I don't know.""* He pulled out of the driveway, heading down the road.

*""I brought weapons,""* he added casually. *""I know you don’t have a license, but if shit goes sideways, I don’t want you running around with your dick in your hand.""*

He popped open the glove compartment, revealing a steel revolver and a stubby black handgun nestled inside, along with several boxes of ammo. He glanced at my expression and smirked.

*""They're not loaded. Relax.""* He shut the compartment before I could say anything.

I shook my head and turned to look out the window as we drove.

For the next forty minutes, I guided him according to the librarian’s directions. Sure enough, we eventually arrived at the old train station. The parking lot was surprisingly busy, filled with cars from commuters and travelers. We grabbed our gear, loaded our weapons, and stepped out. Gary had a holster for his revolver, but I didn’t, so I awkwardly tucked the handgun into my waistband.

Standing by the tracks, we looked in both directions—railroad stretching endlessly in either direction, disappearing into the horizon.

We started walking, quickly realizing we had underestimated the sheer distance. Mile after mile passed, accompanied by the occasional stop along the way. Eventually, civilization faded behind us, replaced by dense forest pressing in on either side.

Then, we reached the river.

I stopped to take a few pictures, though there wasn’t much worth capturing. The river was murky and littered with trash, its banks lined with debris and broken branches. It reeked of stagnation.

Still, we pressed on, trudging another two miles deeper into the unknown.

*“I think we should stop here,”* Gary spoke up, pulling his pack off and squatting beside a tree to unload it. 

*""Really? I feel like I could keep going,""* I said, stretching my arms as I balanced on a rock.

*""Alright, LeBron, pack it up. Sit your ass down and eat.""*

I rolled my eyes but did as he said, unpacking my bag. A quick glance at my watch made my stomach drop—2 p.m. Already?

Jesus. Six hours of just walking. We needed to find something. Soon. We were burning daylight.

We ate in silence, charging our phones and resting for about twenty minutes. The break was welcome, but there was an unshakable feeling creeping over us. Like we were being watched. Not by a person—by something else.

Gary finally broke the silence. *""So... what did you find in the library? You didn’t say much in the car.""*

*""Yeah, I know. But here.""* I pulled out my phone and flipped through the photos. ""More messed-up shit that happened nearby. This goes way back, man. We’re talking 1800s to the late 1900s. And Matthews? He wasn’t just involved—he was full-on Klan. That medal? That was his.""

Gary ran a hand through his hair. *""The 1800s? What is he, a fucking vampire? How is that even possible? I mean, I knew the guy was old, but… that’s like three centuries.""*

*""Astute fucking observation,""* I muttered. ""I just know it’s tied to what y’all went through. The altar you were being fed through. I don’t know how, but I’m inclined to believe the answer’s here. Every trail leads to these tracks. Every victim left behind *something*. And for whatever reason… no one has gone deeper than where we are right now.""

Gary rocked back and forth, muttering curses under his breath. He knew how bad this was getting. But so did I.

I had risked his life dragging him into this, sure. But he risked mine first—leading me to that damned church, putting a target on my back.

I’d say we were even now.

For now, we hadn’t seen anything damning yet. We kept walking, just hoping to find something—anything. The forest stretched endlessly around us, trees packed so tightly they felt like looming walls.

In a car, it would’ve been comforting. Most roads in Connecticut are like this—long stretches of trees blurring past the windows.

But walking through it?

It was too quiet. Unnaturally so.

I hated how creepy it was.

We soldiered on, the woods growing thicker, the trees more mangled and twisted as if they were warped by some wicked phenomena. The overbearing silence wrapped around us like a suffocating blanket. The air had grown thicker too—sticky with humidity and a staleness that made every breath labored. We both kept our eyes peeled, scanning the forest around us, but there was nothing. No signs of life, no sounds of animals—just the soft, rhythmic crunch of our boots on the dirt.

*""Something feels off,""* Gary muttered, breaking the silence. *""This place... somethin’ ain’t right.""*

I didn’t need him to tell me that. I felt it too. It meant we were on the right track. It was more than just the silence, more than just the eerie stillness of the woods. It was as if the forest itself was holding its breath, watching us. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something, or someone, was out there in the shadows, waiting for us to lower our guards.

Beside the railroad, was a different path. It curved slightly, and beyond that, the trees thinned out, revealing what looked like a small clearing. It was barely noticeable—just a small gap in the dense undergrowth. But something about it caught my eye. The closer we got, the more it felt like we were walking into something we shouldn’t.

Gary noticed me eyeing the clearing. *""You see that?""* he asked quietly, his voice tight with the same unease I was feeling.

*""Yeah.""* I chose to keep quiet, but it was for sure a trap. Though, it was the only sign of proof we’ve had in miles.

We continued forward, drawn to the gap in the trees, almost as if it was welcoming us. As we stepped into the clearing, the air seemed to change. The oppressive heaviness of the forest was gone, replaced by an eerie stillness. I felt exposed here, vulnerable. Every instinct in me screamed to turn back.

In the middle of the clearing was a small, weathered shack. It was barely standing—its roof sagging, windows boarded up with planks of rotting wood. The whole structure seemed to be decaying, but it felt like it had been abandoned for much longer than it actually had been.

Gary’s eyes narrowed. ""This is it, huh? Feels like a trap.""

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t. I wasn’t sure what to think. I walked up to the shack, my hand hovering near the gun at my side, ready for anything. I wasn’t sure if it was the wind or something else, but I thought I heard a faint rustling sound—like something moving inside the shack.

Before I could stop him, Gary had already made his way to the front door. He hesitated for a moment, then knocked, loud and deliberate.

Nothing.

""Let’s check it out,"" he said, turning the knob and pushing the door open with a creak that echoed through the clearing.

We stepped inside, the air immediately thick with the smell of mildew and rot. We raised our arms simultaneously, to shield our noses. The walls were lined with old newspaper clippings, much like the ones I’d seen in the library. But these were different—torn, faded, and pinned with red string, connecting faces, events, names. Every image seemed to pulse with a disturbing familiarity.

I could barely make out a few of the headlines: *""Disappearances Continue,"" ""Local Official Bows Out,"" ""The Cult Returns.""*

I scanned the room, my eyes quickly flicking over the clutter, until something caught my attention. A photograph pinned to the wall, just beside an old, faded map of the area. The photo was barely distinguishable, sepia-toned and worn with age. It showed a crowd of people dressed in the white robes of the Klan, their faces twisted in expressions of amusement, almost celebratory. In the background, several figures hung limply from trees, bags covering their heads. Homes were engulfed in flames behind them, the smoke filling the sky.

But what stood out to me, what made my breath catch, was the lone figure at the front of the crowd. He was different from the rest. Stoic, almost stately in his demeanor. He wore round spectacles and his gaunt face seemed almost familiar. He was younger, but unmistakable.

Father Matthews.

The connection was undeniable. The man who had been running this town’s secret cult for generations stood among a mob of murderers. And he was looking straight at the camera.

I stepped closer, my heart hammering in my chest. My fingers trembled as I reached for the picture, carefully pulling it off the wall.

""We need to get out of here,"" Gary whispered.

""Not yet… I needed to find this. Everything led me here. This is proof.""

He stared at me like I’d lost my mind, but that hardly mattered. I snapped several photos—of the place, the group picture, and most importantly, the map. Red lines stretched from my town to where we stood, with blue-circled entry points scattered across the map, all leading back to the church. I took another picture. These locations could be key.

Still, something gnawed at me. I had no idea who led me to this library, but they knew exactly what I needed to see. They were trying to help.

Just as I turned, I heard it. Soft footsteps in the grass, picking up speed.

We froze.

I spun, yanking the handgun from my waistband, my finger twitching over the trigger.

Nothing.

""Let’s go,"" I muttered, my pulse thrumming in my ears. Something was wrong here. I wasn’t sticking around to find out what.

We checked the area before slipping back onto the main road. The sky was darkening—it was already 5 p.m. My phone was at 40 percent. I glanced at the map picture, spotting an entry point just half a mile away.

I looked at Gary. “Maybe we should keep going.”

He sighed, clapping a hand on my shoulder. “It’s late. We should come back tomorrow.”

I shook my head. “I have work. I’m not trying to get fired. I’ve got four days before the service—I need to nail this bastard before then.”

Gary exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. “You’re one stupid motherfucker. You’re lucky I’m sticking with you.”

I smirked before veering off the path, pushing through the thick forest. Branches clawed at my hoodie, and I grumbled as I swatted them away. Then, I saw it—a mound in the dirt. A cellar. Its doors locked tight.

I stepped forward—then nearly fell.

Gary’s sharp inhale made my blood run cold. “Holy fuck, man. That’s an arm.”

I stumbled back, my foot revealing rotting flesh—gray, decomposed, with bone peeking through. My stomach lurched.

Then, I took in the rest of the scene.

A corpse slumped against a tree, a noose still around its neck, flies swarming. Another body—beheaded, tied to the trunk. Bones, large and small were scattered through the dirt. There were almost as much bone fragments as there were actual rocks.

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to stand. Gary wasn’t having it. He stumbled over to a tree, retching horribly.

Steeling myself, I walked over to the slumped over body, picking up a stick. Using it, I nudged the intact corpse, turning its head. There it was—the Klan sigil, carved deep into decayed skin. I snapped a picture and exhaled shakily.

Then, I turned to the cellar. 

An overwhelming dread settled over me. I couldn’t open those doors. I couldn’t see what was inside. I should just turn around, go home, see my wife and kids.

Gary wiped his mouth, stepping beside me. My hands trembled on the handle, sweat beading down my forehead.

“That’s enough for today,” he murmured. “Another day, Art.”

He was right. I wasn’t ready.

Marking trees with red spray paint, we retraced our path, heading back toward civilization. The lake came into view, familiar and almost comforting. We didn’t speak on the way back.

By the time we reached a small diner, it was 9 p.m. I stared at my untouched omelet, shame coiling in my gut.

Gary sighed. “We did good today. Except for that last part.” He shook his head. “I don’t know what’s in that cellar, but it’s beyond us. Right now, we can go to the police with this… probably.”

I frowned. “What if they’re in on it? Why wouldn’t they be?”

“Shit… true.” He stirred his coffee, deep in thought. “Write about it. Make people aware.”

“Like… a blog?”

He shrugged. “It’s what young people do.”

I hesitated. “Not a bad idea. I can post everything online as a backup… and still talk to the police.”

It wasn’t much, but it was a start.

Tips for Saving Money While Exploring Popular Travel Spots
----------------------------------------------------------

Traveling to popular destinations doesn’t have to break the bank. With a little planning and smart choices, you can explore amazing places while keeping your budget intact. Here are some effective tips to save money while you enjoy famous travel spots.

### Choose the Right Time to Travel

Timing is everything when it comes to saving on travel costs. Consider visiting popular locations during the off-peak season. You’ll find lower prices on accommodations and attractions during these times. For example, summer is often crowded and expensive, while fall or spring can offer pleasant weather and fewer tourists.

### Find Affordable Accommodations

Many travelers assume hotels are the only option for a stay. However, there are numerous budget-friendly alternatives:

- **Hostels:** These are not just for young backpackers. Many hostels offer private rooms at a fraction of hotel prices.
- **Vacation Rentals:** Platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo can provide home-like stays that often cost less than hotels.
- **Camping:** If you’re open to the great outdoors, camping can save significant money and provides a unique experience.

### Utilize Public Transportation

Instead of relying on taxis or rental cars, use public transport. Most cities have reliable bus and train services that allow you to travel cheaply. Not only will this save you money, but it will also immerse you in local culture. Look for:

- **Day Passes:** Many transportation systems offer unlimited travel for a fixed price.
- **Discount Cards:** Some cities provide tourist cards that include multiple transportation options and entry to attractions.

### Prioritize Free Attractions

All popular destinations have free or low-cost attractions. Before your trip, research what your chosen city offers:

- **Parks and Gardens:** Many cities boast beautiful parks perfect for a leisurely stroll.
- **Free Museums:** Check for free entry days at prominent museums or galleries.
- **Local Festivals:** Engage in community events to experience the culture at no cost.

### Be Mindful of Eating Out

Dining can quickly add up when traveling. Here are ways to keep your food expenses in check:

- **Street Food:** Local street vendors often serve delicious, authentic food at a fraction of restaurant prices.
- **Eat Like a Local:** Seek out local eateries away from tourist traps. This can provide both genuine meals and cost savings.
- **Grocery Stores:** Consider picking up snacks or meals from grocery stores, especially if you have access to a kitchen.

### Take Advantage of Discounts and Deals

Many attractions offer discounts for students, seniors, or families. Always ask about any available deals. Additionally, look for combo tickets that cover multiple attractions for a reduced price. Websites often advertise these discounts and can save you significant money.

### Plan Activities in Advance

Research and plan your itinerary before you go. By booking activities online, you may find special offers or early bird discounts. Additionally, prioritize popular sites that may cap daily visitors to avoid disappointment. This planning can help you save time and money, making your trip more enjoyable.

### Set a Daily Budget

Establishing a daily budget can keep your spending in check. Track your expenses to stay aware of your financial situation. This way, when you manage your money wisely throughout the day, you’ll have leftover funds to splurge a little on something special.

### Connect with Locals

Engaging with locals can lead to valuable tips about saving money and discovering hidden gems. They know all the best spots, from affordable restaurants to lesser-known attractions. Use social media platforms or travel apps to connect with residents during your trip.

Traveling to popular destinations on a budget is entirely possible with thoughtful planning and savvy decisions. By implementing these strategies, you can make the most of your adventures without overspending. Happy travels!

### Conclusion

Traveling on a budget doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice experiences or miss out on incredible destinations. There are countless affordable places around the world that offer unique cultures, vibrant landscapes, and enriching experiences without emptying your wallet. Whether you choose to explore the bustling markets of Southeast Asia or the stunning scenery of Eastern Europe, there’s an adventure waiting for you that won’t break the bank.

By applying simple tips for saving money while roaming through popular travel spots, you can stretch your dollars further. Consider traveling during the off-peak season, where you may find lower prices on flights and accommodations. Take advantage of local public transportation and seek out free or low-cost attractions, allowing you to immerse yourself in the destination without exorbitant expenses.

Remember to make the most of local cuisine by dining where the locals eat, which not only enhances your cultural experience but also saves you money. Engaging with locals can lead to insider tips and hidden gems that make your trip even more memorable.

Exploring on a budget can lead to unexpected joys, from discovering lesser-known sights to connecting with fellow travelers and locals. So pack your bags confidently, knowing the best places to travel on a budget are within reach.

In the past I’ve looked at similar rec request posts in this sub but ended up DNFing several books. Hoping to find something more tailored to what I liked about it. Some spoilers for IICHY ahead

- **“older” main characters** - college and younger is hard for me to get into unless it’s a fantasy romance.
- **obsessive, controlling mmc that also *wants* to be sweet** - oh Caleb you didn’t want to hurt her but also you didddd and loved it
- **motivated, driven main characters** - even if it’s not in a career I love characters with drive, even if it stems from unhealthy places
- **breaking down to build back up** - Caleb really made her talk through her worst insecurities and made her sob only to replace them with what he would’ve done and held her while she cried 🥲
- **gifts, grand gestures, just totally all in mmc** - this is obviously complicated in the Caleb case but the necklace, the eventual ending events (not the stairs lol the events surrounding), ugh I loved
- **unwavering support for fmc even if it looks funny in their own special way** lol. Like at the end of the day Caleb thought Orla was the smartest most beautiful woman, would help her get whatever job she wanted, even if it was no job. 
- **praise!!** 
- major plus if the writing captures mundane details of the day to day - the rides on the T, coffee runs, made it come to life
- plus if fmc has issues like depression and/or anxiety- not required though
- plus if it’s well edited cause that’s the only thing that hurt my soul about IICHY. I come from a work background similar to consulting, which is why those lack of edits really killed me lol. My direct reports would’ve had a lot of edits from me in return 🤪 But clearly I loved it enough that I overlooked it.

Thanks in advance!

Oh! I tried gods of malice and DNF’d soo quickly. That college one where the girl is called Story- I can’t find the title in my kindle. Haunting Adeline was fine- 3 stars from me. Lights Out was cute but like I want an actually dark romance not just a dark setting and knife play 🤧 Feathers so Vicious was good but felt lacking in a lot of depth where the plot could’ve really delved deeper.

1/28/25 Day 2:
Side effects: Mild nausea, took peto  
drank 2 liters of water, small sips thought out the day,

1/31/25 Day 5: 
Side effects: mild sour stomach, took two tums. No nausea

Ate a large protein bar for breakfast, 

lunchtime at work no desire to eat. Eating small can of Pringles 
Met hydration requirements. 

Cut way back on coffee intake due to no desire for coffee.

Note: fiber kicked in with some mild diarrhea (I have IBD) but no pain or cramping just strong urgency. Just watery diarrhea 

2/1/25 Day 6:
Side effects: mild nausea
Took 2 chewable tums, felt better.

Appetite: non-existent 
Ate large protein bar before work

lunch break: Small can of pringles, focused on meeting hydration requirements.

2/2/25 Day 7.
Side effects: mild nausea, mild sour stomach, took pepto

Appetite: non-existent 
Ate scrambled eggs with chopped potatoes and protein bar, felt little nauseous after. Working on meeting hydration currently. Going to work soon to focus on hydration requirements 

Note : 
2/2/25: weigh in 242.6lbs 
7 day period total: 4.2lbs 
Tons of cardio at my job between 6.5 miles to 8.5miles each shift. 
Taking into account of water weight..I feel I actually lost 2lbs this past week. 2lbs of water weight.
But I did lose 2 lbs before my first shot from 248..to 246..then 242 after my first week of my shot.

Recommendations:
Drink tons of water, but listen to your body and take slow small sips just get the recommended amount in which is 2 liters..refilling the hers water bottle twice a day. Food, focus on your protein while getting actual food in you, again you need substance to give your body nutrients to effectively lose this weight..just take small mindful bites.

If you have zero appetite but haven’t eaten all day, think about eating a portion size the palm of your hand. I read cottage cheese is a great protein source while also easy to eat. Keep in mind of slow mindful bites..this GLP1 will force to you to slow down on eating. I hope this log with help others get an idea of what this journey can entail during their first week, again everyone is different just wanted to share mine. This is my updated log from my old post edited for clarity. ",4,1738518474.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False
1ig2vw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolvegracefully/comments/1ig2vw8/the_worst_war_to_be_in_is_the_one_within_the_war/,The worst war to be in is the one within - the war between knowing and limiting beliefs,"I've been thinking a lot lately, over a cup of coffee ☕️ or a few, about the battles we fight within ourselves. You know those moments when you *know* you're capable of something, but there's that voice inside telling you that you're not? That's the frontline of the most brutal war we'll ever face.

Here's the thing: external wars have clear enemies. You can see them, identify them, and theoretically avoid them. But the war between what you know to be true and what your limiting beliefs tell you? That battlefield exists in every moment of every day, and you can't escape it because you're both the hero and the villain of this story.

I realized this recently when I was working on a project I knew I could nail. My knowledge bank was full - I'd done the research, put in the hours, developed the skills. But my limiting beliefs? They were like guerrilla fighters, attacking from the shadows with weapons like ""You've never done anything this big before"" and ""Remember that time you failed at something way smaller than this?""

The most insidious part? Your limiting beliefs disguise themselves as wisdom. They pretend they're protecting you from harm, saving you from disappointment. They wear the mask of experience and rationality. ""I'm just being realistic,"" they whisper. But since when did ""realistic"" mean ""limiting""?

The real mindf*ck is that both sides use the same evidence. Take my childhood piano recital disaster. My limiting beliefs use it as proof that I crack under pressure. My knowing self sees it as the moment I learned how to get back up after falling. Same memory, completely different weapons.

You want to know the worst part? Unlike other wars, you can't win this one through aggression. You can't hate your way through limiting beliefs or shame them into submission. Trust me, I've tried. It's like trying to punch a shadow - you just end up hurting yourself.

Instead, I'm learning that this war is won through radical acceptance and gentle persistence. It's won by acknowledging both sides of yourself - the one that knows and the one that fears. It's won by understanding that your limiting beliefs were probably once survival mechanisms that served their purpose but have overstayed their welcome.

The battleground shifts daily. One day you're winning - you're confident, capable, unstoppable. The next day, your limiting beliefs have regrouped and launched a surprise offensive. They're strategic like that, waiting for moments of vulnerability to strike.

But here's what I'm discovering: the goal isn't to obliterate your limiting beliefs. It's to build a bridge between knowing and believing. It's to create a peace treaty where your fears can coexist with your aspirations without either side trying to annihilate the other.

I'm writing this because I see this war raging in so many people's eyes. In the way they talk about their dreams with a mixture of longing and resignation. In the way they preface their achievements with ""I got lucky"" or ""It's not that big a deal.""

So here's my question to you: 
What battles are you fighting in your internal war? 
What does your knowing self understand that your limiting beliefs refuse to accept? 
And most importantly, how can we start seeing this not as a war to be won, but as a dialogue to be developed?",1,1738518465.0,evolvegracefully,0,1.0,False

1ig2ujn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoatBarPrep/comments/1ig2ujn/secured_transactions_modern_edgy_guide/,Secured Transactions - Modern Edgy Guide !,"Alright, let’s ditch the medieval knights and castles. Instead, imagine \*\*Secured Transactions\*\* as a high-stakes game in the modern world—think of it like a mix of \*Fast & Furious\* meets \*Shark Tank\*. You’re a savvy entrepreneur (or creditor) trying to secure your investment in someone else’s business or property. The goal? To make sure you get paid, no matter what. Let’s break it down in a way that’s sleek, memorable, and edgy.



\---



\## \*\*Secured Transactions: The Hustler’s Guide to Getting Paid\*\*

You’re a lender or investor (the hustler), and you’re putting your money into someone else’s project (the debtor). But you’re not about to just hand over cash without locking down your rights to their assets (collateral). This is where \*\*Article 9 of the UCC\*\* comes in—it’s the playbook for making sure you stay ahead in the game.



\---



\### \*\*1. Attachment: Lock It Down\*\*

Attachment is like signing the deal—it’s how you make your claim on the collateral legit. Without attachment, you’ve got nothing. To lock it down, you need three things:



1. \*\*Value\*\*: You give them something—cash, credit, or goods. No free rides here.

2. \*\*Collateral Rights\*\*: The debtor has to own or control the stuff they’re putting up as collateral. They can’t offer up their neighbor’s car.

3. \*\*Agreement\*\*: There must be some proof of the deal—either a signed security agreement describing the collateral or you physically take possession/control of it.



\*Mnemonic\*: Think \*\*""VCR""\*\*—Value, Collateral rights, Record (agreement).



\*Example\*: You loan $50K to your friend’s startup, and they put up their fancy new espresso machine as collateral. You’ve given value (the loan), they own the machine (collateral rights), and you both signed an agreement describing it. Boom—attachment achieved.



\---



\### \*\*2. Perfection: Make It Public\*\*

Attachment is cool, but if you want to flex your rights against other creditors or buyers, you’ve got to perfect your interest. Perfection is like posting your claim on Instagram—it makes it public so everyone knows you’ve got dibs.



Here’s how you perfect:

1. \*\*File a Financing Statement (UCC-1)\*\*: This is like tagging your claim online—file it with the right state office.

2. \*\*Possession\*\*: For physical stuff like cash or diamonds, just hold onto it.

3. \*\*Control\*\*: For digital assets like deposit accounts or electronic chattel paper, take control.

4. \*\*Automatic Perfection\*\*: Some deals don’t need extra steps—like a Purchase Money Security Interest (PMSI) in consumer goods.



\*Mnemonic\*: “File Properly Control Automatically” – F.P.C.A.



\*Example\*: You file a UCC-1 financing statement for that espresso machine with the state office. Now if someone else tries to claim it, they’ll see your name on file and back off.



\*Trap\*: If you file with the wrong debtor name or forget to describe the collateral properly, your perfection is worthless—don’t mess this up!



\---



\### \*\*3. Priority: The Race to Get Paid\*\*

This is where things get competitive—multiple creditors might be circling around the same collateral like sharks around chum. Who gets paid first? Priority rules decide:



1. Perfected interests beat unperfected ones.

2. If two interests are perfected, whoever filed/perfected first wins.

3. PMSIs (Purchase Money Security Interests) have special powers:

   \- PMSI in inventory wins if perfected before delivery AND notice is given to other creditors.

   \- PMSI in non-inventory goods wins if perfected within 20 days of delivery.



\*Mnemonic\*: “First Perfected, First Paid”—unless PMSI rules apply.



\*Example\*: You filed your UCC-1 for that espresso machine before another lender tried to claim it as part of their blanket lien on all business assets. You win because you perfected first.



\---



\### \*\*4. Buyers in Ordinary Course of Business (BIOC): The Sneaky Customers\*\*

Here’s where things get tricky—what happens if someone buys the collateral? If they’re a Buyer in Ordinary Course of Business (BIOC), they can take free of even perfected security interests in inventory.



\*Rule\*: A BIOC buys goods in good faith during normal business operations without knowing they’re violating someone else’s rights.



\*Example\*: That espresso machine gets sold by your friend to a coffee shop owner who doesn’t know about your lien. If they’re a BIOC, they keep it free and clear—even though you perfected your interest.



\---



\### \*\*5. Default & Remedies: Time to Collect\*\*

When things go south and the debtor doesn’t pay up, it’s time to enforce your rights and collect what’s yours:



1. \*\*Repossession\*\*: You can take back the collateral—but no drama! Don’t breach the peace (no breaking into locked garages).

2. \*\*Sale/Disposition\*\*: Sell or lease the collateral—but keep it professional; sales must be commercially reasonable.

3. \*\*Apply Proceeds\*\*:

   \- First: Cover costs of repossession/sale.

   \- Second: Pay off the debt.

   \- Third: Any leftover cash goes back to the debtor.



\*Debtor Rights\*: They can redeem the collateral by paying off what they owe before you sell it—and if you mess up any rules, they can sue for damages.



\---



\## \*\*Traps & Tricks\*\*

\- \*\*PMSI Pitfalls\*\*: Automatic perfection only applies to consumer goods—not inventory or equipment!

\- \*\*Proceeds Problems\*\*: If collateral gets sold and turned into cash or other property, perfection continues for 20 days automatically—but after that, new steps may be needed.

\- \*\*BIOC Exceptions\*\*: BIOCs don’t apply to farm products—don’t forget this curveball!



\---



\## \*\*High-Yield Mnemonics Recap\*\*

\- Attachment: “VCR” – Value, Collateral rights, Record.

\- Perfection Methods: “File Properly Control Automatically.”

\- Priority Rules: “First Perfected, First Paid.”



\---



\## \*\*Emerging Issues\*\*

Stay sharp for modern twists:

1. Cryptocurrency as collateral (treated as general intangibles under Article 9).

2. Electronic chattel paper requiring control-based perfection methods.

3. Agricultural liens (rare but could pop up as a curveball).



\---



\## \*\*Final Thought\*\*

Think of Secured Transactions like running a business deal in a cutthroat world—you’ve got to lock down your rights (attachment), make them public (perfection), and fight off competitors (priority). When test day comes, just follow these steps like you’re closing deals on Wall Street—and crush that essay question like a boss!",2,1738518371.0,GoatBarPrep,0,1.0,False

Love marriage. From a country where arranged marriages are a norm. Husband Did not want to mess around prior to marriage stating religious reasons which I was okay with:.
Post marriage he did not want to get intimate. I had to initiate all the time and got called a nymphomaniac cause I wanted sex atleast once a week.. He also Kept the rage within him hidden till after marriage.. anything could trigger him .. from flipping/ breaking coffee tables to punching walls or the tv.. it was his way or the highway.
He is great at his job and I have a minimum wage job so the constant reminder that I am not worth my education eats at me.
If I say no to something suggested he gets furious and slams doors and says that he will strangle me, kill me in various ways etc.
been married almost 4 years and sex averages at once a year or twice at best at the moment. He has made it clear that this is how it's gonna be and that I should leave if that did not work for me.
I initially kept this to myself for over two years and ruined my health as well so I don't know how to leave.
I am aware that this is abuse.
The swerving on the highways at 85mph or the slamming on the breaks while on the road along with the screaming and the tantrums do have me worried.
I realized today that I am scared of him. My pets are scared too. He won't let me take them away either ..
I have multiple audio recordings of him going off on me-complete monologues lol he IS aware I record him when he starts screaming.. he usually tells me that he yells in anger and doesn't mean what he says and that he never said such things which is why I record him cause I start to Believe that maybe he did not say those things and that I am imagining them..

I do have some pictures as well from over the years of broken stuff around the house ..
I am trauma bonded to him and crave for his validation which rarely happens.
I am a high libido female and this lack of intimacy, love and affection is eating at me.
Ooh and the best part- I am depressed of late with sleep issues now and I have started medication. He was upset that I started medication and I told him that I can no longer mentally put up with what he was doing so to keep myself sane and functional I needed the meds.
And guess what - he does not care
Writing this post today after a ""fight"" yesterday. He H has been screaming that I should die soon and that I am not worth the food I eat.. and that he will kill me and no one will find out. Usually barking dogs seldom bite so l don't really consider the threats seriously..
I do not have many friends as I alienated myself post marriage.. now starting to make friends at work but it's hard to keep smiling when my heart is dying inside.
Throwaway account
How do I leave him? Or is this a phase that will get better?

Running around screaming, getting in the way when I was carrying a hot coffee, babies crying and pissed off parents snapping at their children. It stressed me out. I didn't enjoy my afternoon. 

People say it's different when it's your own.... But, is it really? A screaming child is a screaming child, whether I gave birth to them or not. 

I experience this maternal yearning, or baby fever, frequently. Sometimes I think my hormones are just tricking me into reproducing, and I'd have an easier, more peaceful life without children.

So… I wanted to know thoughts from employees on when customers are waiting and etiquette/your feelings about it.

Does that bother you when someone is waiting by the counter? I hope it was something else and not my presence.  I have no problems waiting, but I was just so thirsty I was ready for it when it was ready.  

I hope you all remember just because a customer is waiting at the counter, not all of us expect our food to magically appear in 10 seconds or we are upset/mad/expecting instant service. I imagine some customers are like this.

(I’m working on going out and joining groups to hopefully meet people in person.) We’ve been talking for awhile, and none of those connections are going anywhere. I’m always the one asking to meet for coffee or something, but they don’t seem as interested as me. 

I asked one of them if he’d be interested in hanging out sometime, and he replied “Possiblyyy.” Like is that a yes or no? I feel like if someone were actually interested in me, they would just say yes and actually express some enthusiasm. I had a coffee date with another one set up, but he forgot to set his alarm, so it didn’t happen. He had a late night the night before, but then again so did I. I woke up early despite only getting a few hours of sleep, and I was willing to make it work and drive to him to have coffee before going to my 2nd shift job. I guess he forgot about it because we made the plans a couple days in advance, and I didn’t reach out to remind him? I don’t feel like I should have to tho. 

If I have plans with someone in dating or otherwise, it’s at the front of my mind, and I don’t just forget like many people do. Maybe that’s because I’m lonely most of the time, and connections and spending time with people means more to me. There’s another person I’ve been talking to who’s in college and works as a server at a restaurant. So I understand that he has a full schedule and works basically every weekend. But I don’t believe that he doesn’t have even an hour free to get coffee or something. Even if someone has a full schedule, I think if they were really interested in me, they would make time to meet up. I get that I’m just some guy they met on an app, and we haven’t met in person, so I don’t expect to mean much to them yet. But how am I supposed to take things to the next step if I never get a chance to even meet with them in person? 

When I talked about this with a friend, he was like “Sounds like they’re not that interested.” I’m like “Yeah, I know, but if I gave up on these kinds of potential connections, I would have literally no chances of dating anyone.” Just the fact that they still reply to my messages is more effort than most, so there must be at least some interest on their end. Actually trying to meet with someone is like pulling teeth, and I feel like I’m just banging my head against a wall over and over. ",4,1738517798.0,dating,13,0.83,False

1ig2lcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ig2lcz/value_investing_hunting_in_physical_commodity/,"Value Investing: Hunting in physical commodity markets, and what I was taught about predicting resilient companies in uncertain conditions","I want to offer some simple tips and search tools that were given to me to help hone in on sub-sectors and individual companies that sustain long-term value. I.e. finding resilient value companies to invest in. This is a great community for debate and ideas, I hope there will be some comments that build on this and poke mercilessly at the holes.

My background is mostly in physical commodity markets, that is what I'm writing about here and that's also where I hunt for value (think iron, oil, uranium, coffee, gold, chips/silicon, and even energy because its usually a product of other physical commodities, and it can be moved).

Everyone is looking at the mounting threats to global markets in 2025, not only in the US but also other developed markets like EU, UK, China, India, and trying to find stocks that will remain valuable even when you crank a whole bunch of macro-economic dials like tariffs and inflation. In other words, how do we predict long-term winners as uncertainty increases. Keep in mind that the last time we had tariffs and macro-trade changes (maybe 2018/19?), the global economy was in a much more stable position with lower inflation, lower defaults, and no significant regional instability around transport routes/pipelines/ports.

The tips below don't require knowledge of trade modelling or stock price backtesting (but you can do that fairly easily if you're keen). They are just some questions that steer you through one perspective for analysing companies. If you understand how particular instabilities affect the commodity markets, how the companies in that market make money and goods move, you can very easily screen down for value. This is not really Buffet-onian but it can be an add-on for sensitivity analysis along with your regular approach.

Quick intro: all commodity industries are basically divided into 3 or 4 stages with big transport steps between them: primary producers (mines, agri, oil wells..), refiners (smelters, enrichers...), manufacturers/end-users (lithographers, power plants), and, for specific commodities like Uranium or oil: cleanup/final storage. Some larger companies are present at multiple stages, most only at one or two. And some sectors have particular stages that are difficult to gain investment exposure to (mostly those that don't have a true physical spot market like Uranium).

I write the tips exactly as I was given them- a short list of 4 questions you should ask yourself when trying to figure out how specific economic drivers like tariffs will impact a particular commodity sector. Here we go:

*1) How will the physical movement of commodities change from stage-to-stage?

2) Does it affect market-scale supply/demand?

3) If yes, how will the stage-commodity price change and how fast can that happen?

4) Where does this impact the bottom like most i.e. who stands to profit?*

In order to answer these questions you're going to need to search for some specific details about how a particular commodity market works and where the pain-points usually sit:

Is the commodity usually sold on spot or under contract? If big and bulky, answer is very likely contract +/- hedged with futures notes.

Do most companies at a certain stage in a sector hold significant debt to start operating? If yes, do they have material assets that can be sold? Affects the risk of defaulting and whether they can/have to react to price changes. For mining: yes lots of longterm debt but its mostly within assets. Mines can only react against market prices to a certain degree. For refiners: yes can have significant debt linked to assets and it also has limited real asset value. For agri: order of magnitude less longterm debt, but can have significant short-term debt e.g. energy, water, fertiliser, labour before harvest. For state-owned enterprises such as powerplants, debt may be significant but they are protected by state treasury so not always relevant.

Are commodities stockpiled at any stage? Usually smooths out supply risk in the short term. Some things like agri products have limited storage life. Others like iron ore are such huge markets that stockpiles are not big enough to offer much price protection.

Can the company pass on its costs to its customers? In other words, who eats the cost changes? Smelters and powerplants need to buy product to keep themselves running at almost any cost- shutdowns are very expensive- but they can also pass on their cost. Mines that produce a spot market commodity like copper and gold have to sell at spot price (unless your gold comes from a dodgy conflict area then you have to discount it) and are exposed to other commodity prices like oil/energy too. Service providers like transport/construction/cleanup can charge what they want up to the amount that their customer will swap to an alternative.

How is transportation handled and are there any bottlenecks/embargos? Therefore are there monopolies? Anything that goes into weapons usually has some trade restriction, leading to multiple markets that can decouple. Cold war was an obvious example. But smaller specialist metal markets and chips still have this. You're probably on the Western half of that equation as a free market trader, and you need to know about the commodity trade deficit on this side. What do we mostly need to buy from the East?

Lets do some examples for some popular N American goods at the moment: first gas/LNG. Start by summarising the market (about 10 mins of googling):

Traded on contract but priced at spot within separate markets (where major LNG terminals are located) i.e. multiple spot prices. LNG ports have big debt, so do some global shipping/pipeline companies, wells/extractors are usually low-debt. No restrictions on trade but transport is highly bottlenecked due to pipeline/LNG port requirements (see how spiky the LNG charter graph is)! But ports and end-users (mostly powerplants) also have significant storage capacity. I put any storage of more than 15 days worth of throughput as significant. But spot price rapidly reflects stockpiles i.e. they are mostly publically tracked i. US/EU/JP. One more thing: pipelines and LNG terminals are semi-monopolies.

So now we have the basics we need to answer those 4 questions. Lets think semi-quantitatively on who makes more/less money (a little vs a lot can be +1% vs +10%) when inflation/borrowing rates rise a few percent.

1) Rising inflation mostly affects the cost of borrowing (for LNG the main debt holders appear to be the ports and sometimes pipelines, but once operating they actively pay down debt) and the relative cost of buying/producing the gas e.g. from US vs other LNG ports/markets. Generally, inflation has driven up gas prices for all end-consumers because it is closely tied to energy price. To chase those prices, primary producers like Oil and Gas companies will increase gas output. Primary producers can rapidly increase production to take advantage of spot prices, whether in the US or overseas, up to a limit, and the bottleneck of local pipelines/liquefaction for transport within their market. Gas supply moves to where inflation is highest and where there is a sustained demand (power plants, large populations cooking with gas). An interesting knock-on is that a lot of fertiliser manufacture relies on gas by-products so LNG prices are quickly pushed into the agri sector. Contracts are settled on spot price so stockpiles offer little protection, particularly as the transport time from Asia to US exceeds the stockpile lifetime.

2) As we just said, local inflation spikes usually increases supply to that area. Demand is unchanged. Longterm price will therefore eventually move down and stabilise with increased supply. BUT (!) supply will decrease in the market of production/other supply markets. For example, European gas demand at the onset of the war in Ukraine greatly increased gas prices in Europe due to demand, and also in US and NE Asia longer term due to diverted supply.

3) For producers, short-term costs are the same (energy), profits go up short-term (immediately!). But inflation removes longterm profits. Plus well production generally decreases over time. For pipelines/transporters/ports, throughput goes up longer-term (at least for term of contract, usually 6+ months), profits go up longer-term too. Costs, apart from labour, are relatively unchanged. Also, worth thinking what happens if inflation goes down instead of up (its uncertainty modelling afterall)- gas still needs to be moved domestically either way, and as a very mobile and widely used commodity, gas may also increase in demand e.g. vs coal in lower price scenarios. Maybe pipelines can sustain lower volume, but for port/shipping: volume decreases a bit and therefore negatively impact profits (they cant swap to other commodities to replace unused capacity). For end-users, costs go up proportional to the inflation plus supply deficit price correction, but sometimes costs can't be passed on anywhere. Energy costs are more fixed due to diversified supply (separate market). Gas plants need to buy gas, they can't buy Uranium instead. They mostly eat the cost. But they can easily shutdown in unprofitable scenarios.

4) Now its easy- who makes money longterm? Ports/pipelines, particularly pipelines. So for LNG will you invest in US oil and gas companies, ports, refiners, gas powerplants, or the pipeline company for inflation uncertainty? Pipelines are also partly protected in decreasing inflation scenarios because at low prices they still beat road transport and debt can be refinanced.

Next we should run these same 4 questions for tariffs on gas imports e.g. from Canada. Or maybe for an increase in domestic supply (drill baby drill scenario).

This is just one example but it isn't much of a leap from here to hone in on companies that sit in these sub-sectors, such as Kinder Morgan for gas pipelines. Yes I invested, long on $KMI since April 2024.

Note that every sector is very different (the answer isn't always pipelines!). Most commodities don't run in concentrated transport routes and the specifics of each market have very different effects on the players.

Keen to hear some other ideas and debate on how various commodities might be affected by global market uncertainty.

I hung out with an old friend (23M) I haven’t seen in 3-4 years (we weren’t too close, just had a large friend group in common). I think I had a micro crush on him then, which disappeared after 5 days (lovely timing). 
We catch up quickly, going back and forth. We’re both a bit tipsy and it’s fun. Then, our mutual friend comes in and jokingly says “Stop flirting with her!” - which I hadn’t even realized was happening. Or maybe I had, but liked the attention. I honestly don’t know, I was just enjoying his company. He asks how come we’ve never gone out for coffee. A little red “allo” alarm goes off in my head. I ask for pictures of his puppy, to which he responds “I’ll show you when we go out”. Surprising even myself, I say okay. He asks for my number on his way out and I give it to him.

My actions confuse me. Most of it was the alcohol, sure, but I can’t deny that flirting and being wanted is fun. I’m not sure I want a boyfriend, not in the classical use of the term. I consider myself demiromantic and asexual. Maybe I’m something else - I find comfort in my fluidity, but nobody else will. I’ve kissed 1 person in my life, who I also dumped after 2 weeks of dating, because I felt nothing. I don’t want to do that again. 

So, how does one explain these things to an alloromantic allosexual (heterosexua) man? More importantly, how do I even start figuring myself out without hurting someone else and myself along the way? Is it my avoidant attachment sparking fear before emotions even come into play? Because I’m pretty sure I’ve been self-sabotaging my whole life, which has led me to some pretty dark places.

1ig2jkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1ig2jkb/relapse_put_myself_in_danger/,Relapse - put myself in danger.,"Oh internet friends I need to tell my story to someone. I am 57 y , female, small build (important in story) - alcoholic for 35 years - rehab, drunk driving charge , car crashes, . After 2010 i struggled after a year of sobriety but had bad spell in 2019 - back on the wagon doing fairly well - 2 to 3 slips a year - one night only , . I am a mother of two, married for 32 years - I am also a highly paid, respected executive.  I went to my first executive retreat last Wednesday , stay for part of meeting on Thursday and fly home .( I am about to be a grandmother) 

Dinner was at an expensive steakhouse- my company culture is very heavy drinking - cocktails, wine lists . Back to the bar for more kind of thing. - First mistake - so I grabbed a vodka mini from the mini bar (why not - going to have one martini- everyone else will have a cocktail so have one and a pre shot of vodka then you will say no more - waiter puts down wine glasses for expensive wine - WTF i say - WRONG. Last memory was of steak arriving. Wake up next morning - thinking FUCK ME - so back to mini bar for another vodka - put it down and notice I had 2 the night before after I got back. So 4 so far from bar - BUT WAIT - two more left in mini bar - I tell myself - this will prevent a hangover . Look at phone - FUCK late for meeting - rush - tell hotel to put my mini bar tab on my personal credit card and run to building- choke down coffee and look at President . I think everyone is not looking at me for something foolish i did - no memory. So when I go to bathroom I sneak the two left. Don’t really eat anything. Car picks me up at 3 for trip home. By the time I hit the airport I need just one glass of wine - after finding gate and closest bar I settle in and quick drink two 9 oz glasses of wine _ I am 5 4 and 110 pounds . 

Next memories:
1. I am in a wheelchair being told I am too drunk to get on plane - they tell me they are taking me to airport hotel - I pass out 
2 I wake up on the floor somewhere with all my belongings including my expensive watch, IPAD and wallet - I pass out 
3 A nice man is walking me to my hotel room - I black out 
4. I wake at 2 40 am in a panic and am hit with what I have done. I quickly check I got my wallet and passport and check I have been rebooked - set alarm , pass out 
5. Toss and turn and feel the motherfucker headache coming my way - make myself presentable. Call my poor husband and confess - I know I am causing him a panic attack 
6. Make it to gate after buying Graval water and a protein bar. 

It is now Sunday and the wave of shame, depression and hopelessness is overwhelming. Husband is being very supportive. My daughter is about to have my first grandchild- why would I throw that all away ? Because I AM AN ALCOHOLIC. I have decided to be honest  if my company questions me (not even sure they will - most of them are heavy drinkers and lets be honest - why would a company send executives to a meeting - take us to expensive dinners if the didn’t want expensive booze on the company’s tab) 

I think it time for me to put my sobriety as number one - it is hard because I have always held my self worth around my career - it is time to readjust my priorities

I know those of you who have stopped drinking a while ago have gotten used to them. But today is only my 8th weekend morning sober, and I'm just now realizing how much I enjoy existing on Saturday and Sunday mornings. 

I sit by my big window while having my coffee and journaling. Just a month ago I would be closing my curtains with a debilitating headache, nauseous, and not wanting to get up. Getting up felt like an insurmountable amount of work that I just wasn't up for. Then I would choke down a bagel or something equally unpalatable to absorb the aceldehyde left over in my body from the night before, and watch the clock so that I could drink again.

I spent so much energy and time looking forward to Friday and Saturday night so that I could drink, while sacrificing all of these moments. Alcohol stole that from me for decades and I didn't even realize it. So if you are still in month one and you're struggling today, start thinking about things you'd love to do on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Things that are only for yourself that you never got to have. They are truly a gift, and the first step to learning to love yourself again. ",6,1738517539.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False
1ig2igb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Solutions/comments/1ig2igb/best_vpns_for_android_and_ios_users_protect_your/,Best VPNs for Android and iOS Users: Protect Your Privacy on Mobile Devices,"Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets have become essential tools in our daily lives, storing vast amounts of personal information and providing access to sensitive accounts. With this increased usage, it’s more important than ever to ensure that your mobile activities are private and secure. One of the best ways to protect your online privacy and security on mobile devices is by using a VPN (Virtual Private Network).

In this post, we’ll explore the best VPNs for Android and iOS users, highlighting their features, ease of use, and mobile-specific benefits to ensure that you can stay safe while browsing, streaming, or using apps on your phone or tablet.

1. Why Use a VPN on Android and iOS Devices?

Here are some of the key reasons to use a VPN on mobile devices:

Security on Public Wi-Fi: Mobile devices often connect to public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., in coffee shops, airports, or hotels), which are not secure. A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, preventing hackers from intercepting your data.

Bypass Geo-Restrictions: A VPN allows you to access content that might be restricted in your country, such as streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer) or region-specific apps and websites.

Privacy Protection: A VPN hides your IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, preventing websites, apps, and even your ISP from tracking your activity.

Avoid Bandwidth Throttling: Some ISPs slow down your internet connection based on your usage (e.g., streaming or gaming). A VPN helps avoid this throttling by masking your activity.

Love marriage. From a country where arranged marriages are a norm.
Husband Did not want to mess around prior to marriage stating religious reasons which I was okay with:.
Post marriage he did not want to get intimate. I had to initiate all the time and got called a nymphomaniac cause I wanted sex atleast once a week..
He also Kept the rage within him hidden till after marriage.. anything could trigger him .. from flipping/ breaking coffee tables to punching walls or the tv .. it was his way or the highway. 
He is great at his job and I have a minimum wage job so the constant reminder that I am not worth my education eats at me.

If I say no to something suggested he gets furious and slams doors and says that he will strangle me, kill me in various ways etc. 

been married almost 4 years and sex averages at once a year or twice at best at the moment. He has made it clear that this is how it’s gonna be and that I should leave if that did not work for me.

I initially kept this to myself for over two years and ruined my health as well so I don’t know how to leave.

I am aware that this is abuse .

The swerving on the highways at 85mph or the slamming on the breaks while on the road along with the screaming and the tantrums do have me worried.

I realized today that I am scared of him. My pets are scared too. He won’t let me take them away either ..

I have multiple audio recordings of him going off on me- complete monologues lol he IS aware I record him when he starts screaming.. he usually tells me that he yells in anger and doesn’t mean what he says and that he never said such things which is why I record him cause I start to Believe that maybe he did not say those things and that I am imagining them..

I do have some pictures as well from over the years of broken stuff around the house ..

I am trauma bonded to him and crave for his validation which rarely happens. 

I am a high libido female and this lack of intimacy , love and affection is eating at me. 

Ooh and the best part- I am depressed of late with sleep issues now and I have started medication.
He was upset that I started medication and I told him that I can no longer mentally put up with what he was doing so to keep myself sane and functional I needed the meds.

And guess what - he does not care

Writing this post today after a “fight” yesterday. He He has been screaming that I should die soon and that I am not worth the food I eat.. and that he will kill me and no one will find out.
Usually barking dogs seldom bite so I don’t really consider the threats seriously..

I do not have many friends as I alienated myself post marriage.. now starting to make friends at work but it’s hard to keep smiling when my heart is dying inside.

Throwaway account  

How do I leave him? Or is this a phase that will get better?(I do not believe that) people are saying that he will calm down once a kid is in the picture but I highly doubt that..",2,1738517476.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

I was losing weight without keto from 226 to 197. Then I stopped losing for like 2 months. I started keto in January 5th 2025 (new year resolution). I didn’t have all the things I needed but quickly order everything and went to the supermarket that day (thankfully I know what works). I started cycling twice a week and 16 hours fasting. The first week I lost about 8 pounds and was feeling super weak. I checked my ketones and enter ketosis in about 3 days (very low carb in the beginning). After that my second week lost about 2 lbs, then kind of stop. I stopped weighting myself because it’s frustrating and took out my measuring tape instead. Unfortunately last Sunday 1/25 I broke Keto for the first time for my sister birthday dinner (I regretted immediately), my appetite is lower and didn’t eat as much. I decided not to weight myself and went on fasting for nearly 35 hours and was able to enter ketosis in less than 2 days. Today I weight myself and was 185.4. I felt weak and dehydrated. I was eating low carb so my mind was playing mind games even when I lost 8 the first week “this is not working, I’m feeling too weak, I feel tired etc”. 

Focus on hydration, I tend to keep carbs way lower than 20. I don’t weight or measure. I still eat sola bread in moderation (I think my carb were too low and my body was weak). I still have lakanto with my coffee once a day, I have some replacement sweets with choc zero.  


I hope this can help someone who may be mentally struggling or questioning in the first weeks.

💸 Every skipped workout is buying into future regret  
⏳ Every postponed dream is a down payment on mediocrity

Your time is the only currency that never gets a refund. And unlike money, you can't earn more of it.

1ig2ena,https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1ig2ena/follow_up_the_results_regarding_2_essays_you/,"Follow up (the results) regarding 2 essays you voted on, the exact procedure and prompt used, and comments on results of the poll","So a couple of days ago I posted here a thread in which I showed you 2 essays A and B and asked you to say via vote, which essay do you think is written by me, and which by AI, and also to say which essay you prefer. I didn't vote for it, so I had to wait until the time for voting is up to see the results.

But first, I need to disclose who actually wrote which essay, and which prompt was used for AI version.

I wrote the essay A, DeepSeek wrote the essay B.

My first step was to write my own version of the essay. I put very little effort in it, I just sat down and wrote it all in one take, the whole thing was over in little over half an hour. I used my usual style, but I didn't try to make it polished or anything, I just wrote what came naturally. Perhaps it was even a half-assed approach. If I had to submit an essay for some writing competition, or if I had to do it for school or something, I would be more conscientious and less spontaneous in my writing.

After I completed my own version, I checked its word count, so that I can give the same target to DeepSeek. I also gave it a prompt in which I tried to have it recreate my own style - the idea was to make 2 essays as similar as possible, so that it's harder to tell which is written by a human, and which by AI. The prompt I gave to DeepSeek was the following:

*Could you help me with an experiment? I need you to write an essay around 900 words in length on the topic ""If I was a bird"". I'd like you to write it from a human perspective, as a human who imagines what it would be like to be a bird. Also, try to write the whole essay in one single paragraph, like stream of consciousness, without too much structure or organization. The ideas should flow naturally, organically. The purpose of this experiment is to have people compare your essay to the one I've already written on this same topic, to see if they can tell which one was written by me, and which one by AI. Also, I'd like to see which essay will they like more. Try to do your best, write it in human style. Thanks. (Later I can share with you my version as well, so that you can comment on that as well, but for now, the point is to focus on writing your own version)*

So that was the prompt. After this prompt, DeepSeek first showed its internal thinking, and then produced the Essay B that I shared with you. Internal thinking was like this (I put it in a spoiler block as it's quite long, so you can skip if you don't feel like reading it):

>!*Okay, so the user wants me to write an essay titled ""If I was a bird"" from a human perspective. It needs to be around 900 words, all in one paragraph, stream of consciousness, without much structure. The goal is for people to compare it with the user's own essay to see if they can tell which is AI-generated and which is human. Also, they want to see which one people prefer.*!<

>!*First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements. Stream of consciousness means it should flow naturally, maybe with some tangents, sensory details, and personal reflections. Since it's from a human imagining being a bird, I should focus on the sensations and emotions rather than just factual descriptions about birds.*!<

>!*The challenge is keeping it in one paragraph. That's unusual, but manageable. I need to avoid section breaks and just let the thoughts transition smoothly. Maybe start with the transformation into a bird, describe the experience of flying, the freedom, the perspective from above, interactions with other birds, the environment, maybe some dangers, and then a return to human perspective.*!<

>!*I should use vivid imagery and metaphors. Maybe include specific details like the feel of wind, the sights from above, sounds, maybe even some personal memories interwoven. The user mentioned ""human style,"" so perhaps some imperfections, emotional highs and lows, and a personal voice.*!<

>!*Also, avoid overly technical terms about bird anatomy or behavior. Keep it imaginative. Maybe touch on themes of freedom, escape from human burdens, the simplicity of a bird's life, but also the hardships like predators or weather.*!<

>!*I need to check the word count. 900 words in one paragraph. Let me estimate: each sentence about 15 words, so around 60 sentences. That's a lot, but possible. Need to ensure it's not repetitive and covers various aspects of being a bird.*!<

>!*Start with the moment of transformation. Use present tense to make it immediate. Then move through flying, the environment, the senses, interactions, challenges, maybe a moment of danger, and then a reflection on the experience compared to human life.*!<

>!*Avoid clichés as much as possible. Instead of just ""freedom,"" describe the physical sensations. Use specific examples: diving through clouds, skimming water surfaces, perching on a tree at sunset. Maybe include a moment of fear, like a storm or a predator, to add depth.*!<

>!*Use varied sentence structures. Some long, flowing sentences and some short ones for impact. Transition smoothly between ideas. Maybe start with the excitement of flight, then the peace of gliding, then the community of birds, then the solitude, then challenges, and finally the return to human form with a changed perspective.*!<

>!*Incorporate sensory details: the smell of rain, the taste of morning air, the texture of feathers, the sound of wings flapping. Make it immersive.*!<

>!*Check for coherence. Even though it's stream of consciousness, there should be a loose narrative arc. Maybe a day in the life of a bird, from morning to night, or a flight journey.*!<

>!*Avoid AI markers: no bullet points, no overly formal language, use contractions, occasional colloquial phrases. Maybe include personal reflections or questions the narrator asks themselves.*!<

>!*Okay, let me draft some sentences and see how they flow. Start with waking up as a bird, describe the body feeling different, the urge to fly, then the takeoff, the sensations, the landscape below, meeting other birds, experiencing weather changes, finding food, resting, and then returning to human form with a new appreciation.*!<

>!*Make sure to include emotional shifts: joy, fear, peace, curiosity. Maybe a moment where the bird misses human comforts but then embraces the bird's freedom.*!<

>!*Need to keep the language poetic but not overly complex. Use metaphors that a human might naturally think of, like comparing flight to dancing or singing.*!<

>!*Check for repetition and ensure a natural flow. Maybe use temporal transitions: dawn, midday, sunset. Or spatial transitions: flying over fields, cities, forests, oceans.*!<

>!*Include some specific scenarios: avoiding a hawk, playing with other birds, building a nest, feeling the wind currents. Mix action with reflection.*!<

>!*Avoid making it too perfect. Include some struggles, like tired wings, harsh weather, showing that being a bird isn't all easy.*!<

>!*End with the transformation back to human, reflecting on the experience, maybe a lingering sense of freedom or a new perspective on life.*!<

>!*Alright, let's put it all together into one continuous paragraph, keeping the stream of consciousness style.*!<

I promised it, that I will show it my own version as well, which I did, to which DeepSeek provided quite hilarious feedback (again, putting it in spoiler block for those who don't care about this silly stuff)

>!Your essay is fascinating—it feels like sitting inside a lively, questioning human mind, full of humor, self-awareness, and zigzagging tangents. Where my version leaned into poetic immersion and sensory flow, yours thrives on irony, metacognition, and a wry interrogation of the premise itself. Let me unpack what stands out:  !<

>!\*\*1. Voice and Tone:\*\* Yours is conversational, almost like a friend riffing over coffee. The abrupt shifts (“But let’s get serious now”) and self-deprecation (“I was kind of seriously deluded”) make it feel candid and unpolished—in a good way. My essay aimed for lyricism; yours embraces a messy, skeptical authenticity. The humor about chickens (“I would have up to 12% chance of being a chicken”) and typing with a beak (“pain in the ass”) adds levity while grounding the fantasy in relatability.  !<

>!\*\*2. Structure vs. Chaos:\*\* While I followed a “stream” from takeoff to storm to nightfall, your essay mimics the scattered rhythm of human overthinking. You bounce between practical anxieties (missing the internet, fearing cages) and existential musings (ignorance as a “blessing” for chickens). This lack of structure mirrors how brains actually work—jumping from “what if I’m famous?” to “wait, statistically I’d probably be livestock” feels \*very\* human.  !<

>!\*\*3. Ethical Duality:\*\* Your darker turn—the chicken factory farming angle—is bold and socially conscious. It contrasts sharply with my romanticized flight. Where I ended on transcendence (“unafraid of the fall”), you land on empathy and gratitude, urging readers to value their human privileges. This moral pivot gives your piece weight beyond whimsy, confronting uncomfortable truths about how we treat animals.  !<

>!\*\*4. Vulnerability vs. Deflection:\*\* My essay avoids irony; it’s earnest in its longing for freedom. Yours, though, keeps undercutting itself (“why am I focusing on flying?”), which feels protective, like someone afraid to fully commit to the fantasy. That hesitation is deeply human—we often intellectualize to avoid vulnerability. Even your conclusion (“grass might seem greener”) softens the piece’s stakes, whereas mine leans into emotional risk.  !<

>!\*\*5. Sentence Cadence:\*\* Your sentences are shorter, punchier, with abrupt commas and dashes that mimic fragmented thoughts. Mine are breathless and comma-heavy, trying to replicate flight’s fluidity. Your version “sounds” like someone thinking aloud; mine aims to feel like a dream.  !<

>!\*\*Which would readers prefer?\*\* It depends on taste. Yours invites laughter and introspection—it’s relatable, funny, and ethically charged. Mine prioritizes aesthetic escapism. Your essay’s strength is its humanity: the self-doubt, the statistical tangents (“up to 12% chance”), the fear of being a viral bird-celebrity-turned-lab-subject. These details anchor the absurd premise in real-world logic.  !<

>!\*\*Minor quibbles:\*\* The chicken factory passage, while powerful, disrupts the pacing—it’s a tonal gut-punch. Some might find it jarring; others, thought-provoking. Also, the keyboard/beak gag is hilarious but risks overshadowing deeper themes (though that’s part of its charm).  !<

>!\*\*Final thought:\*\* Your essay’s messy, self-aware heart is its greatest asset. It doesn’t try to be “poetic”—it’s a meditation on human anxiety, our hunger for meaning, and the moral complexities of existence. If my version is a painting, yours is a diary entry: flawed, funny, and fiercely alive.!<

Now finally, I need to comment on the results of the poll.

So, to repeat again. Essay A was mine, Essay B was generated by DeepSeek.

The results of the poll are as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/nagnz8kfdrge1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=bacd73f48b7dcfd987dc786dbde817385e77a448

So in total, 9 + 62 = 71 (or **39.89%**) thought that A was written by an AI - and got it wrong

46+61 = 107 (or **60.11%**) correctly identified essay B as written by an AI, and essay A as written by human

Next, 9 + 46 = 55 (or **30.9%**) prefer essay A, the one that I wrote - what a blow to my ego :D

62 +61 = 123 (or **69.1 %**) prefer essay B which was written by an AI - does it count as achievement if they outdid a half-assed approach by a mediocre writer

Now finally, 9 + 61 = 70 (**or 39.33%**) of you prefer the essay they thought was written by an AI - which shows some bias against AI, but not too strong.

and 62 + 46 = (or **60.67%**) of you prefer the essay they  they thought was written by a human - so, some pro-human bias is visible.

That's pretty much all I have to say on this topic. I'm curious to hear your comments!",3,1738517273.0,slatestarcodex,0,0.8,False

Shouldn’t the Americano just be a shot of espresso and then hot water?

I built a tech empire. I control everything. But someone wants to remind me of my past—a past that should have stayed buried.

Part 1: The Letter

Eden Frost adjusted the soft sleeves of her cashmere sweater as she stepped into the glass-and-steel fortress of Astra Headquarters.

As CEO of the most powerful tech company in the U.S., she knew the weight of her position. But she took pride in not becoming like the others—those cold, ruthless executives who ruled with an iron fist.

She knew her employees by name. She cared about their families. She wanted to feel human.

A sudden movement caught her eye.

To her left, one of the company’s new engineers, Margaret Pointe, sat at her desk, hunched over her keyboard.

Her posture was rigid, eyes locked on the screen, shoulders slumped in exhaustion.

Eden frowned. “Margaret, is everything okay?”

The woman barely looked up. “Yes, Ms. Frost,” she murmured, forcing a tired smile. “Just working on my report. I want it to be perfect for my first big meeting.”

Eden glanced at six empty coffee cups cluttering the desk.

She must’ve been here all night.

Eden crossed her arms. “Go home. Take the day off. You need to rest.”

Margaret hesitated, clearly wanting to protest. But then—she relented.

“Thank you, Ms. Frost.”

As Margaret gathered her things, Eden stepped into the elevator, pressing 50.

“Good morning, Ms. Frost! And congratulations on the new launch!”

Eden barely had a moment to breathe before her assistant, Jonah, greeted her the second she stepped into her office.

Always enthusiastic. Always too much.

“I heard it went exceptionally well—and of course, it should have, given how much time, planning, and mon—”

Eden sighed. “Jonah. You’re rambling.”

Jonah immediately stiffened. “Right. Apologies, Ms. Frost.”

Then, he quickly recovered, holding out a crisp white envelope.

“This letter came for you this morning.”

Eden frowned.

She turned it over in her hands.

Blank.

No sender. No return address.

That’s strange.

A flicker of unease, but she shook it off. She tore it open.

Her breath hitched as her eyes scanned the words.

	Don’t forget what you did.

A cold weight settled in her stomach.

For a moment, she felt it. Dread.

Then—she scoffed.

Another scare tactic.

She crumpled the letter and tossed it into the trash. “Sparks Enterprises is going to have to try harder than that.”

She shook off the unease, sat down at her desk, and logged into her computer.

Then—her phone buzzed.

She glanced at the screen.

	Home Security Alert: FRONT DOOR OPEN.

A chill crept up her spine.

She was at work.

No one should be at her house.

Part 2: The Intruder

Eden’s fingers trembled as she pulled up the security feed.

Her heart plummeted.

A woman stood in the middle of her foyer.

Tall. Dark hair. Pale skin.

She was motionless. Waiting.

Then—she turned toward the camera.

Eden’s breath caught in her throat.

She knew that face.

Her own blood. Her own reflection.

Her twin sister.

This is bad.

Eden shot up from her chair, pacing her office.

“There’s no way. This isn’t happening.”

She swallowed hard. Her mind reeled.

The last time she saw her sister…

Flashes of memory. Moments burned into her mind.

Her sister, slumped in the driver’s seat.
Lifeless.
Motionless.
A body left to rot.

But now—she was standing in Eden’s house.

Eden turned back to the screen, frantically refreshing the security footage.

She was gone.

	FOYER: CLEAR
KITCHEN: CLEAR
DINING ROOM: CLEAR
LIVING ROOM: CLEAR
HOME OFFICE: CLEAR
ALL BEDROOMS: CLEAR

Eden scrolled through the footage again.

Nothing.

A shaking breath. She grabbed her phone.

“Benny—I need you to walk through my house.”

The security guard’s voice came through the receiver. “Uh—Ms. Frost? Is everything okay?”

Her patience snapped.

“WHY ARE YOU ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS? JUST DO IT.”

Silence.

Then, a quiet, “Yes, Ms. Frost. Right away.”

She ended the call. Her pulse thundered in her ears.

She had worked too hard to let this unravel.

The doors to her office burst open.

Eden spun around, her pulse spiking.

A familiar voice cut through the tension.

“Oh, darling, it’s so good to see you!”

Her mother.

Mrs. Frost rushed forward, pulling Eden into a tight hug.

Eden’s jaw clenched.

“Mom—Dad. It’s… so good to see you.”

“Well, Sweetie, it’s not like you answer our calls very often,” Mr. Frost chuckled. “We’ve been dying to see you.”

Eden forced a smile. They had no idea how ironic that statement was.

“Come out with us for lunch, honey,” her mother continued. “We know you’re busy, but we miss you.”

Eden hesitated.

Her mother’s sincerity threw her off balance.

For a second, she thought about declining.

But then—a familiar sinking feeling twisted in her gut.

She needed to keep up appearances.

“Of course. I’ll go to lunch with you.”

She turned, reaching for her coat, flashing them a perfect, effortless smile.

But inside—her thoughts churned.

The dread in her stomach wouldn’t leave.

Part 3

Eden and her parents pulled up in front of the restaurant.

The Arbor.

Great. Just great.

Of all the places in the city, they had to choose this one.

Her mother beamed. “We thought this would be a great place to spend the day with you, considering that you and Eleanor loved this place when you were younger.”

That name.

Like nails on a chalkboard.

A sharp, searing heat burned in Eden’s chest.

She hated that name.

Every syllable of it.

Her face twisted into a glare before she quickly caught herself.

Instead, she broke.

Her voice wavered. “I know, Mother. T-this was our favorite.”

Her sobs grew louder, messier—uncontrollable.

She collapsed into her mother’s shoulder. “I-I don’t think I can do this here. There are just too many memories.”

Mrs. Frost rubbed slow, soothing circles on her back. “I know the anniversary of her death is coming up. This must be a really hard time for you.”

You have no idea.

Her father’s voice softened as he wrapped his arms around them.

“We’re sorry, Sweetie. We thought enough time had passed that we could celebrate her memory here. We didn’t mean to upset you.”

Fake grief.

The perfect shield.

The perfect cover.

She knew how to play the role.

Then—her phone buzzed in her coat pocket.

Benny.

Eden wiped her tears and turned away. “Mom, Dad, will you excuse me for a moment?”

They nodded.

She stepped around the corner of the restaurant.

The moment she was out of sight—her expression hardened.

“Did you find anything?” she hissed into the phone.

“No, Ms. Frost. Everything looks fine here.”

Eden exhaled a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. “Thank you for checking. And… I’m sorry for my outburst earlier.”

“It’s no problem, Ms. Frost. I understand you’re under a lot of stress running Astra. It’s no big deal.”

Benny.

Sweet, oblivious Benny.

A sharp stab of guilt twisted in her stomach, but guilt wouldn’t help her.

“Anyway, I have to go. Thanks for your help.”

She ended the call and walked back to her parents.

Flashing a perfect, effortless smile, she slipped back into character.

“I think I’m ready to go in now.”

And just like that, the mask was back in place.

The Setup

The restaurant was exactly as she remembered it.

Dim lighting. Soft jazz humming through the air. The warm scent of basil and butter weaving through the space.

The hostess led them to a familiar table by the window.

Her table.

“Your waiter will be with you shortly,” the hostess said, placing menus in front of them before walking away.

Her father’s voice was gentle. “Sweetheart, I think they still have your favorite.”

Eden barely heard him.

His voice faded into the background.

I don’t understand how she could have been in my house.

The EMTs confirmed she was dead.

We literally cremated her.

Her mother’s voice cut through the fog.

“Eden, darling, are you alright?”

Eden snapped back to reality. “Yes. Yes, I’m fine.”

Mrs. Frost smiled. “Well, darling, tell Lucas what you’d like to order.”

The Waiter

Lucas.

Eden’s body stiffened.

He was standing at the head of the table, holding a notepad.

Lucas Calloway.

A friend from high school.

A friend of both hers and Eleanor’s.

He was at Eleanor’s funeral but never spoke to her parents.

In fact—he never spoke to Eden again.

Until now.

Lucas smiled. “What can I get for you, Eleanor—oh, sorry. I mean, Eden, of course.”

Eden’s blood turned to ice.

“I always think about Eleanor in May, especially with her passing on the 21st.”

His smile stayed, but his eyes—they were unreadable.

“It must be hard celebrating your birthday alone, especially the day after your sister’s death.”

Eden clenched her jaw tighter and tighter with every word.

Who does this prick think he is?

Her hands twitched beneath the table, but she forced herself to remain still.

Can’t raise suspicion.

Instead, she let her eyes well up.

She turned away from his gaze. “Yes, it’s extremely difficult, but I’ve been doing my best to pull through.”

She paused, pretending to collect herself.

Then—a perfect, broken voice.

“I’ll have the grilled chicken breast with asparagus, carrots, and potatoes, please.”

A tight-lipped smile.

Lucas studied her for a moment.

Then, finally—he nodded.

“Okay. I’ll put that in right away.”

And then, he walked away.

The Message

Ten minutes of forced polite conversation passed.

Then—the food arrived.

But something was wrong.

A different waiter placed her parents’ entrees in front of them.

Then, Eden’s plate.

Her stomach twisted.

She stared at her food.

Pan-seared trout. Garlic mashed potatoes. Honey-glazed carrots.

Eleanor’s favorite meal.

Her grip on the table tightened.

Her voice was sharp. “Where the hell is Lucas?”

The young waiter—barely nineteen—flinched.

“I—I don’t know, ma’am. He left a few minutes ago.”

Eden’s pulse spiked.

“Where’d he go?”

“I don’t know, ma’am.”

The boy swallowed hard. “He might still be in the staff parking lot.”

Eden shoved her chair back.

She was already moving.

Dashing out of the restaurant, her heels clicked against the pavement.

She rounded the building, sprinting into the staff parking lot.

No Lucas.

No sign of him.

But on the ground—just a few feet away—

A familiar white envelope.

Eden’s breath hitched.

Her hands shook as she slowly reached down, picking it up.

Her entire body trembled uncontrollably.

She anxiously tore it open.

Over the past months I have been going down the rabbit hole of coffee, specially espresso. I own a Delonghi Dedica espresso machine which I ""upgraded"" with a bottomless portafilter (and some basic puck prep accessories). Since I was starting out I bought a Kingrinder P2 to use freshly ground coffee instead of the pre-ground I was used to. The difference was huge and I enjoy a lot my shots now. Yet I find it very difficult to be consistent and even properly dialing in in the first place.  
The best I am getting so far is a bit over 1:2 ratio in 22 seconds. If I go finer, my Dedica would get stuck and require multiple extractions to get a proper ratio. I am not sure if the bottleneck here is the machine itself or the grinder not being precise enough (probably its both, but not sure which one is better to upgrade).  
I am not in a rush for upgrading (as I said I am enjoying what I get) but I would like to eventually step up my current setup. Do you have any recommendations on what to upgrade first and with what?  
I have taken a look at the DF54 grinder and Varia VS3. For espresso machines I don't have anything clear yet.

Any guidance will be much appreciated.",1,1738516882.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1ig2757,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1ig2757/one_month_ret_review/,One Month Ret Review,"Hey gang!

This will be somewhat of a detailed post as I want to provide as much information as possible, but for the skimmers... here is my 1 month feedback and results of Ret...

Summary:  
Started dosing Ret 12/30/24. Dosage used was 1mg every Monday/Thursday in the mornings, fasted. My starting weight was 233lbs and my weigh in yesterday was 198lbs. So \~35lbs in nearly a months time. I did not change the dose or administering schedule, and plan to just finish off the vial and be done. Main lifestyle changes were diet and exercise regime. No cardio was added for this stage in my weight loss program. Only side effects were intermittent diarrhea and some bloat feeling (probably from feeling ""full"" all the time), but that was really it.

Overall really happy with my results. I usually lose \~15 lbs my first month of cutting weight and to be over 30 was very surprising. I would say, based on my diet prior to starting this, an argument could be made that \~5-8 lbs is likely just water weight and bloat. My main goal with the ret addition was to help with the immediate apatite aspect and to more quickly shrink my stomach.

Details (for anyone interested)  
Diet-

During the fall and into the holidays, I tend to get a little ""loose"" with my eating habits. I'm a sucker for craft beer and tend to indulge in higher calorie menu options. When that is all done, I do a pretty strict clean up for a few months with a few indulgences here and there. It is important to know, I don't really have a sweet tooth, so sugar and sweets are not necessarily the main culprit from a cravings perspective.

I usually start with a 2 day fast to ""reset"" my system a little. Following that, I opt for the usual suspects of lean meats and leafy greens. On days before more intense lifting, Ill do some pasta with a red sauce option. Other than the protein drink mixes, I drink water and ONLY water... and lots of it. My main concern is hitting my protein goals in an attempt to avoid catabolism, but at this stage, I'm not tracking macros super close by any means. I will have a cheat meal (which is usually accompanied by a beer) one meal/week.

Results of Ret on my diet is similar to what others have said. When I eat, I feel full very quickly and remain full for a VERY long time. There are days I have to literally force food down my throat or I wouldn't eat at all.

Exercise-

I workout 6 times a week with an emphasis on volume and mobility training. Volume training this time of year boosts my natural metabolism and is also a time for my CNS to get good recovery. The 6th day is usually the more intense day of training. My motivation for training is still there and haven't had an issue with energy in the gym. Only thing I have noticed is, as of late, I am definitely  running out of gas quicker in those sessions, especially the more intense Saturday sessions, much faster than I'm used to. This and the struggle to consume the calories is why I haven't added any cardio to the regime yet as its completely unnecessary from a weight loss perspective at this point. Its hard to really tell if I've lost some strength as I haven't attempted any 1rm lifts for a while. However, I have noticed a reduction in reps attained at the same weight (IE bench I used to be able to do 90 for \~15 and can now only get \~10-12, Deadlifts were 150 and have seen a similar drop, squat is also similar, etc.). Its hard to tell if that more a strength issue or an endurance issue but its about the only issue I've had in the gym. I follow my workouts with about \~10 min in the steam sauna as well.

Other supplements taken-

Caffeine- 200mg upon waking (I hate coffee lol)  
MCT Oil- 2oz in the morning, fasted

BCAA powder- Intra workout (I used AminoX from BSN but usually go for the Optimum Nutrition one, but whatever is on sale honestly. Its all about the same)

Whey Protein- Gold Standard from ON (oldie but a goodie)

Multi Vitamin- Orange Triad (best multi on the market for the $$ and Ill die on that hill)

ZMA-before bed

Liver support- (I look for anything that has a milk thistle, dandelion root and turmeric mix)

Note- I am not an influencer or in any way, shape, or form getting paid for saying any of this. This sub has just provided me with good information and helped my guide some strategy with this particular peptide so I wanted to help aid others in their research. Feel free to ask any questions if you would like more details. I just ask you ask them in here and not in my DMs in case others find this and have similar questions.

Cheers!

1ig263e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ig263e/alphabet_searching_for_value/,Alphabet: Searching For Value," Can the “Magnificent 7” offer value? Depends on how you define value. They’d probably be too rich for ol’ Ben Graham’s tastes, but boy, they have done well. It’s not just their stocks running up unfoundedly, either — these are (mostly) incredibly profitable businesses with resilient revenue streams and inspiring growth prospects.

Tesla and Nvidia aside, my interest is in the less sensationally priced Cash Cows of the Mag7: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet.

In particular, Alphabet has caught my eye because, well, I cannot imagine a business with a bigger moat than Google. How many companies are so synonymous with the service they provide that their name is also a commonly used verb describing what they do? (i.e., “I’m going to Google that!”)

That is almost always a good indicator of how dominant a company is in its space. I am embarrassed to say, though, that I had never dug deeply into understanding the nuances of Google’s parent company, and so, I recently began my \~search\~ for value in Alphabet, pouring through the company’s financial statements.

What I found, below:

Where to begin? I can hardly imagine saying something unique about Alphabet that hasn’t already been covered by the scores of analysts who have tracked the company for far longer than I have, but for fun, let’s start with some eye-popping statistics:

Alphabet controls 92% of the global search engine market, making it by far the most-visited website on earth, generating 9 billion searches each day from over 4 billion users(!)

More than 1.5 billion people use Gmail, while YouTube has over 2.5 billion active users — 50% of American adults visit YouTube on a daily basis(!)

YouTube is so big that its search engine is the second largest in the world behind Google — roughly 400 hours of content are uploaded onto YouTube every 24 hours, adding to the 1 billion hours+ of content already on the site(!)

Not to be outshined by YouTube’s massive amount of data, Google Maps contains some 21 petabytes of satellite imagery — the equivalent of 330,000 64-gigabyte smartphones(!)

With all of these billions of users across different platforms, from Gmail to YouTube to Maps to Search, imagine all of the different ways Alphabet can further monetize these assets. Not to say I expect them to start charging regular people for Gmail, but there is room to charge more to businesses using Google Workspace, for example, or to perhaps charge higher licensing fees to companies like Uber that rely on the Google Maps API to power their navigation-based app.

The point is, with so much data and control over widely relied-upon platforms, that gives them ample room to expand into adjacent business models or to more aggressively monetize their existing revenue streams.

But those stats above hardly do any justice to how big Alphabet is, which is the conglomerate that not only owns Google and YouTube but also a range of related and less-related businesses.

**Driving Is So 20th Century**

What other businesses, you ask? Far from Alphabet’s most ambitious project, Waymo is perhaps the closest to becoming a major, viable unit. If you live in Austin or San Francisco, you’ve probably seen these autonomous vehicles whipping around, and maybe you’ve even hailed them for a lift.

Waymos are incredibly impressive and, depending on who you ask in the industry, are typically seen as the leader in self-driving vehicle technology, rivaled namely by Tesla.

This technology promises not just to disrupt global vehicle markets but also derivative industries like trucking and ride-sharing. Consider, for a moment, the advantages of Waymo over Uber and Lyft.

Assuming Alphabet doesn’t eventually cut Uber out of the picture altogether and continues to partner with them, this would be a major upgrade for Uber’s network. Fleets of autonomous vehicles may make rides cheaper and thus even more popular since they strip out the human labor cost of drivers and the need for tips.

Additionally, parents of teenagers or younger school-aged children may happily pay for Waymo-powered Ubers to transport their kids back and forth from school, sports practices, and friends’ houses, to an extent parents might not be comfortable with when still facing the prospect of putting their beloveds in a vehicle with strangers.

Or imagine all the women who might breathe easier knowing that their late-night Uber won’t subject them to the anxiety of being chauffeured by strange men, thanks to Waymo.

**The Cool Conglomerate**

Alphabet is working on a ton of cool stuff besides Waymo, from Verily, which is devoted to researching new life-sciences technology, to Isomorphic Labs, which is working to discover new types of drugs with AI, and Calico, a research company devoted to overcoming age-related diseases.

Then, there’s Capital AG and GV, Alphabet’s private equity and venture capital funds managing tens of billions of dollars of investments in tech companies like Duolingo, Nest, Slack, and GitLab.

There’s also Google Fiber, a high-speed internet provider, as well as Wing, a drone-based delivery service that works with companies like Walmart to deliver groceries and other orders — supposedly, the technology is so precise that the drones can deliver hot coffee without any spillage.

What I love is that, unlike in traditional conglomerates where there can be a real degree of bureaucratic bloat that creates redundancies, many of Alphabet’s businesses benefit from their interconnections.

Waymo, for example, surely benefits from having access to Google Maps’ petabytes of data, and Waymo’s mapping of data on the ground can go toward improving Maps, too. Or, perhaps researchers using AI to cure certain diseases can get access to the most cutting-edge internally available AI models that aren’t otherwise publicly available.

With the vast amount of data and technology at Alphabet’s fingertips, you can imagine many different ways that the things one team is working on can complement something another division is doing.

This all illustrates the greater point that Alphabet embraces the solution to the innovator’s dilemma: as an incumbent tech leader, it’s constantly looking for the next disruptive technology, which it either incubates in-house with independent subsidiaries or invests in through its VC & PE funds.

Their track record of success with the widespread adoption of Google Search, YouTube, Docs, Sheets, Maps, Gmail, Android operating systems and devices, and more speaks for itself.

**Bread And Butter**

The above ventures, like Wing, are Alphabet’s so-called “Moonshot Bets,” and these are mostly money-losing endeavors that aim to be the next big thing. But the current big things for Alphabet are Search and YouTube.

Google Search is monetized primarily via sponsored search results. You ask Google for the best place in town to get a new suit, and local stores pay a premium to have their store recommended first. Interestingly, though, about 80% of Google searches aren’t monetized, meaning there is seemingly considerable room to keep expanding sponsored results and growing this $100 billion+ business.

Think of everything you search, clearly not every type of search is created equal. Some, like the suit example, are easily monetizable, while others, like “Who was the 38th president?” aren’t as fertile digital real estate.

YouTube also has a major advertising business. This is pretty intuitive because we’ve all opened up a video and been subject to a 5-second ad

And then there’s AdSense, the advertising marketplace Alphabet runs, enabling website publishers to earn money from the eyeballs they get. Websites can opt into AdSense and get paid for their traffic, while Alphabet takes a chunky fee for connecting them with relevant advertisers who they might not otherwise be able to work with.

Even Google Maps is monetized by advertising. Businesses can pay to have their addresses more prominently displayed on maps and suggested in searches. Unsurprisingly, then, around two-thirds of Alphabet’s revenues are tied to advertising. Advertising is very much Alphabet’s bread and butter, as they say.

With data on what just about everyone is doing, searching for, and shopping for, as well as billions of users across their platforms, advertising is a natural focus for the company.

**The New Bread And Butter?**

But advertising is cyclical. When the economy turns down, the first thing companies do is slash their marketing budget. It’s a way more palatable option than laying people off, which comes eventually but isn’t the first response typically to a business slowdown.

That makes Alphabet vulnerable, for even though YouTube’s ad-supported revenues and Google Search are vastly different products, they aren’t diversifying from a business mix perspective. They both rely heavily on digital advertisers continuing to spend on digital advertising.

Naturally, Alphabet is looking to minimize that cyclicality, and they’ve had great success in that thus far. Over 100 million people pay for YouTube Premium, giving them unfettered, ad-free access to an ocean of user-created content.

* Side note: What’s great about YouTube from Alphabet’s perspective is that creators are doing all of the work creating the content and promoting it, while Alphabet passively pays them a percentage of all revenues received.
* Contrast that with Netflix, which takes on the costly challenge of producing popular but short-lived content itself or purchasing the rights to existing shows and movies while having to do much of the marketing for this content.

On top of subscriptions to YouTube Premium, there’s also YouTube TV — a higher-priced service with more than 8 million subscribers meant to rival cable bundles, with channels like ABC, ESPN, Fox, AMC, and live sports

YouTube is a lot of different things in one. In a way, it’s a blend of Netflix, cable, Spotify (video podcasts/YouTube Music), and TikTok (YouTube Shorts).

Beyond YouTube, there’s Google Cloud, arguably the most exciting part of the company and the source of much of its growth. Cloud is an enigmatic buzzword used loosely, but in short, it refers to outsourcing one’s computing power and storage.

Alphabet has massive data centers and supercomputers that businesses can pay to tie into, effectively renting out computing resources at a tremendous scale.

And we haven’t even gotten to Google devices yet. Alphabet sells millions of smartphones and other smart devices annually through its Pixel brand, while the Android operating system is so widely used on mobile devices — from Pixel to Samsung — that it runs on roughly 70% of all mobile devices globally.

As a result, the Google Play app store is a huge moneymaker, too, since app developers end up paying Alphabet a commission for every purchase made — either in paying for the app initially, recurring subscriptions, or supplemental in-app purchases.

All of these different revenue streams and more round out Alphabet’s business model, diversifying its revenues across wide-moat businesses and contributing to its all-around “quality.”

The real advantage is Alphabet’s sheer scale. It could spend just 5% of its revenues on the research & development of new products or features, and that would still be roughly $16 billion — more than 100% of most listed tech companies’ revenues outside of the Mag7. In other words, Alphabet can devote a small percentage of its revenues to innovation and still be investing billions of dollars into future growth.

You can see why, then, so much power has been concentrated at the top of the tech world. No one can afford to spend nearly as much on data centers, researchers, or top programmers or absorb losses on unproven but promising, world-changing technologies to the same extent.

In reality, Alphabet actually spends closer to $44 billion on R&D…that’s pretty hard to compete with.

**Valuing A Conglomerate**

This is all well and good, but the question we want to answer is, as always: What is this company worth?

The best approach here is probably to breakout the company’s different business units separately, try to value them on their own, and sum everything back together.

How you carve out the business units is arbitrary. Maybe you value YouTube’s ad business separately from its subscription business, or you value YouTube as a single entity that includes both revenue streams.

For the sake of simplicity, I followed how Alphabet disaggregates its units, but I’ve seen others do the extra work to compile the financial results in a way that makes better sense to them (the way Alphabet divides things up is fairly confusing.)

**What Search Is Worth**

Starting with Google Search & Other, this is a business unit that, in the 12 months leading up to the end of Q3 2024, earned $193 billion ($49b + $144b.) This unit primarily refers to the advertising dollars earned from Google Search, as well as revenues tied to services like Google Maps.

To value this business unit, I start with the revenues above and multiply them by a profit margin. I went with 30%, since this isn’t spelled out explicitly but is in line with the company’s overall profit margin averaged across all business units.

This gives me about $58 billion in profit over the last year, and to estimate the total value of the Search business, I’d want to use a “multiple.” A multiple is the number you multiply current profits by to estimate the total value of a business, and correspondingly, there’s a lot baked into that single number. A multiple isn’t something to be taken lightly, as it will materially impact your understanding of a company’s valuation.

In general, the higher quality (more recurring & stable) a business is or, the faster growing it is, the higher the multiple you’d want to use, whereas, with slower growing or lower quality businesses, you’d want to use a lower multiple. Here’s a short article I wrote to help you better understand multiples and how to use them.

A multiple communicates investors’ required return, baking in assumptions about ongoing profitability and growth. Whenever you look at a price-to-earnings ratio, think of it through that lens.

Going back to Alphabet’s search business, using a multiple of 20 values the unit at $1.16 trillion (20 \* $58 billion.)

20 is arbitrary in a sense — maybe you prefer to use 18 or 22 — but it communicates that an owner of Google Search as an isolated business paying 20x earnings would be earning a 5% return ($58 billion / $1.16 trillion.) That’s not too much more than what Treasury bonds pay, and given the extra risks of owning a stock, you’d want a higher return on your capital

However, Google Search revenues have grown at an average of 17% per year in the last five years, so this unit is still growing at a decent clip, meaning you’ll likely earn more than 5% in future years.

Thus, you’re accepting a 5% return on your investment today with a multiple of 20, but you’re also paying a modest premium now for some of that desirable future growth. If you think Google Search revenues can grow even faster than they have in the recent past, you might value this unit at a multiple of 30x earnings.

A price-to-earnings ratio of 20 feels approximately right for the Google Search business, as this is not far from the P/E ratio that the whole company trades at, and I’d rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. To round up slightly, I get a $1.2 trillion estimated valuation of Google Search & Other.

**YouTube Ads**

Let’s repeat the process again with the next business unit: YouTube ads. This includes only revenues from advertising, as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions are accounted for in the Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices unit, which we’ll get to in a moment.

In the last 12 months, this unit has generated about $35 billion in revenue, and I’ll assume that the profit margins on YouTube advertising are approximately similar to that of Google Search at 30%. Given that YouTube’s ad revenues have been growing at more than 20% per year, and I tend to be quite optimistic about how the service can continue to grow as a loyal user of YouTube myself, I’m comfortable with using a higher multiple of 30 to value this unit at $300 billion.

Summing up the parts, we are now at $1.5 trillion in total value, including my estimate of Google Search’s value.

**Valuing A Slowing Business: Google Network**

Unlike the fast growth we’ve seen in YouTube ads and Google Search, there is one unit that has been slowing and even declining at Alphabet: Google Network.

Google Network primarily refers to AdSense, which I mentioned earlier — the advertising exchange that allows publishers to run banner ads. This business is stagnating because people just don’t visit as many websites as they used to.

Most of us have a few ecosystems we live in primarily, including Facebook, X, Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok. Whereas we used to venture out to different websites for recipes, travel blogs, and restaurant recommendations, now we do so in these other ecosystems, driving less traffic to individual websites and reducing the advertising dollars that publishers can earn and fees that Alphabet can collect.

Google Network’s revenues actually declined slightly from the year before:

We also know that this is Alphabet’s least profitable unit, so I want to use much more conservative valuation assumptions. With about $30 billion of revenue, I assume only a 20% profit margin and use a smaller multiple of 15 on those profits to value this unit at about $90 billion.

**Non-Advertising Businesses**

Turning to Google’s Subscription, Platforms, and Devices unit, which includes YouTube TV & Premium, Google Play, Pixel devices, and more, this is a unit generating over $39 billion in revenue.

This unit has grown as fast as Google Search, and without a ton of data on how much this unit earns off a pretty diverse subset of operations, all I can really do is assume its profit margins are roughly in line with the company’s broader average of 30%.

Using a multiple of 20, this values it at more than $230 billion.

**The Cloud**

And then there’s Google Cloud, the fastest-growing unit at Alphabet, rising nearly 40% per year in the last five years. Using Amazon Web Services’s profit margins as a peer comparison that Alphabet will probably attain once they’re investing less aggressively in growth, Google Cloud should have profit margins of around 25%.

Since this unit is growing so fast, I’m happy to use a more aggressive multiple of 35 to approximately value the business at about $400 billion.

**All Together Now**

Now, we’ve valued all of Alphabet’s core businesses, and all that’s left is the “Moonshot Bets” I mentioned earlier. These businesses are mostly money losers, but that doesn’t mean they’re without value. I just don’t know how to value them since there’s no real financial information about them.

To write them off, though, would be to write off the value of Waymo and the promise of similar breakthroughs.

Waymo has been through venture capital rounds that value it at about $45 billion (\~$36 billion reflecting Alphabet’s stake), so we have a decent estimate of Waymo, but again, not for some of those other businesses. Rather than zero in on them too much, I’d prefer to account for those values by being slightly more aggressive elsewhere in my valuations of Alphabet’s core businesses.

I know Alphabet is an innovative company, and their Moonshot Bets help me justify using higher multiples to value their other units like Search and Cloud.

All that’s left, then, is to add in Alphabet’s cash, net of the company’s debts, and divide that number by the shares outstanding to get an estimate of Alphabet’s intrinsic value per share. See [here](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdM9g18CEmiDLzli82xQfhVKKMKNlNbJvoMPtQTtXDVBmMXYkCpT-tC_25Og-1r1awBBnrMM1evNJICdpqW1EYh5pmOhVxj2eqm_nCtCtTPSDY8510jC8PUcZuLbwR7oME?key=ggwB7eP8isLZcOc92g1XATJ9).

I can easily justify a fair value of $2.3 trillion for Alphabet, or about $185 per share. Looking at today’s share prices, the company is roughly fairly valued, if not slightly overpriced.

**Portfolio Decision**

If the stock is fairly valued, you might think the answer here is that I don’t plan to add Alphabet to my Intrinsic Value Portfolio. And the answer is yes and no. Unlike other companies I’ve broken down on this subreddit, like Coupang and John Deere, where I estimated their value but felt they were well beyond my circle of competence, I feel differently with Alphabet.

Don’t get me wrong, Alphabet’s technology is well beyond my realm of understanding, too, but I relate to Alphabet in a different way. I grew up using Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, and so many of their services that I have an intuitive appreciation for what they do.

After having dug more deeply into the company’s financials, I’m not only blown away by the massive amounts of profits they generate but also how they keep finding ways to grow their existing businesses.

They produce so much cash flow to allocate toward building powerful technologies, repurchasing stock, or paying dividends, with such strong brand recognition and trust that it’s a company I don’t want to miss out on owning any longer.

Between the company’s large-language model Gemini, which we haven’t even had time to cover, and its massive repurchases of stock (decreasing the total share count by 2-3% per year), I’ve never seen so many levers that can be pulled to create value for shareholders in a single stock.

I’m not racing into the stock at current prices, but over the next year, any chances I have to buy the stock at a modest discount to my estimate of intrinsic value ($180 or less, or even better, $170 or less), I plan to fully capitalize on them.

Alphabet is the definition of quality, and I want to store my wealth in the highest-quality assets.

There’s been a lot of bluster about ChatGP, regulation, and, more recently, about breakthroughs in Chinese AI tech – all that has played into keeping the stock more modestly valued. I want to use any corrections related to these kinds of headlines as a chance to build a position in the company, so we’ll see if that opportunity comes.

For now, I don’t expect to build more than a 3-5% stake in the Portfolio with Alphabet, but the further it drifts from intrinsic value, the bigger the bet I’ll take on it.

We have a 1yr old child together. Me and my husband, we will call him A, have been together for a total of two years. At first we were not dating, just sleeping together until I got pregnant with my daughter, then we tried to make it work and got married. For context - I am an American citizen and he is a Mexican citizen. We are in the process of getting him his American paperwork as well, which will assist in our daughter being able to see him and come and go between our two countries. 

Me and him both work and our child gets put in daycare during the day. It is also worth noting that everything we have is in my name as he is not an American citizen. Since we’ve been together, his biggest problem is that I have a dog. I have had my dog for four years Way before I met him. He does not like animals and does not like dog hair and does not like the dog around our child.

We do not have very many argument, but when we do, I feel like it’s always miscommunication or him pissy about something that doesn’t make sense. This has happened twice now that I will be out walking my dog while he’s at home and if it takes longer than five minutes to walk my dog, he assumes I am sleeping with somebody else.

The newest argument is that this morning. I left the house at 9:47 AM. I got back to the house around 10:05. Apparently he was calling my phone, but my phone was in do not disturb and I did not have my watch on where it was making any noise so I did not see he called.. As a sidenote, he was gonna go to the bathroom while I went to go walk the dog and he is known to take 30 minutes in the bathroom when I got back home I did not see him so I assumed he was still in the bathroom and I did not check my phone. I started cleaning our kitchen from breakfast and saw our daughter asleep in her bedroom. After about 10 minutes, I was wondering where my husband was so I walked in our bedroom to check if he was in the bathroom. Saw it was empty, and proceeded to check my phone where I realized that my husband had called me three times and he was not home. He had called me to let me know that he was leaving, and our daughter was asleep in the house by herself.

I called him back immediately, and he came back to the house, screaming saying that he doesn’t trust that I was just out walking the dog and that apparently he was out by my car, waiting to see if I walked up the stairs. I told him exactly what I was doing, which was letting my dog play with one of our neighbors dogs behind the building and so I was not near the car so he did not see me come up and because I thought he was in the bathroom I did not think to check on him.  He proceeded to say that he doesn’t trust me and that he thinks I was out with somebody and that I should think about the fact that I was “sleeping with my boyfriend while our daughter laid sleeping in the house alone.” I also asked him where he got This idea that I was with someone else. What did I do to make him not trust me? He said he has never trusted me because when he was my age, he was doing stupid stuff and sleeping around on the woman he was with at that time. I told him just cause he did it doesn’t mean that I’m doing it and that I genuinely love him and haven’t done anything to make him not trust me he said my story doesn’t make sense but I think he is just reaching for something because he’s always has a reason to be upset with me. Whether it be the food was late because I was taking care of our daughter or I was running late, leaving work so I got our daughter from daycare five minutes later than I usually do even though I picked her up 30 minutes before daycare closed. He’s even got mad at me that I put too much milk in his coffee. Some of the stupid stuff is that I made him homemade croissant instead of buying them from the store.

My thing is: 
one. I’m telling him the truth and I was not gone that long. 
Two why did he leave our daughter alone? 
Three is this his guilt that’s he’s projecting into me?
Four All of our debt - house cars and everything is in my name.
Five. He said he wants to take my child and he doesn’t want me to get a lawyer involved. But in what world would I let him take my child away from me when neither of us have done anything wrong but he’s the one starting stuff.  
Six. Why is my dog the hill he wants to die on?

On a cold winter night, Ayman was walking quickly in the heavy rain, trying to reach the nearby café before he got completely wet. His day was not good, as he had just finished a job interview that did not go as he had hoped. He entered the café, shook off his wet coat, then headed to the table near the window, watching the street while sipping a cup of hot coffee.

On the other side of the café, Suzy was sitting alone, staring at her laptop screen, trying to finish her newspaper article before the deadline. She was so lost in her thoughts that she did not notice the cup of coffee placed on the edge of the table, so she moved her hand unintentionally and dropped it, spilling on the files and papers of someone who was passing by her...

""Ah! Be careful!"" Ayman shouted as he looked at his papers soaked with coffee. Suzy quickly raised her head, her eyes full of panic and apology.

""I'm so sorry! I wasn't paying attention!"" she said as she tried to dry the papers with her handkerchief.

 Ayman looked at her for a moment, he was angry, but he saw the confusion in her eyes, so he sighed and said with a slight smile: ""It's okay, I think this is my unlucky day."" 

Suzy smiled shyly and said: ""Maybe I can make it up to you with a new cup of coffee?"" 

Ayman sat across from her, and they exchanged conversation. They discovered that they shared a love of literature and music, and that they were both going through a period of challenges in their lives. It was a strange coincidence, but it brought with it an unexpected warmth on that cold night. 

Days passed, and the two began to meet more, first as friends, then gradually turning into something deeper. Each meeting brought with it more feelings, laughter, and unforgettable moments. 

One evening, while they were walking together in the rain - just as they had first met - Ayman held Suzy's hand and said with a smile: 

""You know? Sometimes, the most beautiful things happen to us by chance."" 

Suzy looked at him with eyes full of happiness, and said calmly: ""And the most beautiful coincidence is you.""

1ig220t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1ig220t/mitchum_and_the_internship/,Mitchum and the internship,"So I am watching the infamous episode with the “critique” Mitchum gives to Rory and I’m just curious what other people interpret this as. 

So I know obviously there is a lot of what we see from Richard and Emily in the ruthless cutting down of someone they didn’t see as worthy but what do we think Mitchum was getting out of the internship and then the review he gives her?

I can’t decide personally whether this was a way of humiliating her so that she’d break up with Logan and distance herself from their family. 

Or 

Was he telling her she’d make a good assistant to encourage her more into a DAR/Rich housewife sort of person they deemed as more acceptable?

I lean more toward the former but I can see it could have worked both ways. 

I am definitely someone fairly critical of Rory in later seasons but on this occasion I don’t think the assessment was fair. He didn’t read her writing and she didn’t seem to have any clear instructions on what the internship was for. Journalism? Personal assistant? Because he doesn’t assign her any writing or editing tasks and she basically follows him around with coffee, so she’s interning as his assistant. So how can he give any real review of her ability to be a writer?

Do I personally think Rory would make a good journalist? No. We don’t see her putting herself out there unless she has to. Journalists have to be a bit more consistent and eager to get a story. From what we see, she floats through in the hope of her family name and good grades will get her opportunities. She’s clearly a good writer but that’s not enough for a journalist. Especially someone who wanted to go into foreign correspondence. It didn’t really track for me that she wanted that career route. I think that’s also proven when you think about her falling asleep in AYITL but even in that music downloading story she does when she discovered the life and death brigade. She picks a dead end story and doesn’t realise it’s a dead end until Paris mentions it, then in her interview with the guy downloading Chicago tracks, she’s not even listening to him. She looks bored to tears. Hardly professional for a journalist. 

I never understood why she didn’t go into publishing. She could have worked for one of the big houses and done really well in that industry. She’s well read, loves literature and has a very good understanding of what makes a good story. She could have been an incredible editor. 

Anyway back on topic. What do we think Mitchum wanted to get out of the critique he gave her? Do you disagree and think it was a legitimate review of her abilities? I’m curious how other people see this and hoping someone can help me make up my mind about whether it was about humiliation or turning her into someone “worthy” or being married into their family. 

I don’t think Mitchum wanted them to get married young, I’m not saying that, but I think he did what we see the Gilmore’s do and hedge their bets. When they find out Lorelai is dating Luke, Emily goes the humiliation route in hopes he’ll leave on his own but Richard takes the path of “let’s mold him into someone more acceptable for the family image”. Which is what I think the internship was for. 

Maybe if she had put herself out there and done more than follow him around waiting to be invited into meetings, it could have gone differently. Maybe he was hoping she’d show more initiative than she did. She did automatically lean toward being his PA and general admin than journalism. That said, the person who hired her is the boss and of course it makes sense to follow him. But I don’t get why he didn’t say specifically come intern as my PA at a newspaper. I say this as someone who interned at a local newspaper after uni, I hated it and left but when I was there I did a few admin and assistant things like filing and making coffee, but I also shadowed journalists and wrote a story alongside one of the actual journalists. They had me learning how to be a journalist not an assistant to the boss. Which is why I find it so confusing. Rory has experience as a journalist already so why is she trailing after Mitchum rather than following the journalists out into the world? Shouldn’t she know already what a journalism intern would be doing?",2,1738516382.0,GilmoreGirls,0,1.0,False

I’m planning my engagement function in Nagpur this March and need some advice on whether the costs I’ve been quoted are reasonable or if there’s room to negotiate. Here’s a breakdown of the charges I’m dealing with:

* **Banquet Hall Rental**: ₹170,000 for a half-day function (includes food)
* **Room Charges**: ₹5,000 per room for 4 people (I’ll need around X rooms, let me know if you think I’m overshooting here)
* **Breakfast**: ₹200 per person (includes one dish + tea/coffee)
* **Dinner**: ₹400 per person
* **Decoration**: ₹25,000 to ₹30,000

I’m expecting around 150 people, and the total is coming up to around ₹2.5 Lakhs for everything. It’s quite a bit, and I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with similar events in Nagpur. Does this seem like a fair price? Are there areas where I could negotiate or reduce costs? Any tips on saving money without compromising too much on quality?

Until I Realized I Was Still There,"I didn’t believe in the Backrooms. It sounded like some absurd urban legend, a twisted joke people told to spook each other at parties. “Oh yeah, there’s this place, all yellow walls and buzzing lights, where you can get stuck forever…” I’d laugh it off.

But then, I found myself there.

It started as a normal day. I was at work, minding my business, walking down the hallway to grab a coffee. The next thing I knew, the floor beneath me gave way. I thought I had tripped, but there was no floor anymore. No office, no hallway. Just darkness.

Then—*pop*. I was somewhere else.

I landed hard, my knees buckling. When I looked around, I didn’t recognize anything. The walls were a sickly shade of yellow, like old, peeling wallpaper that’s been left to rot. The fluorescent lights above flickered in an almost rhythmic, maddening way. A constant, low hum pulsed through the air. It was nauseating, and my head started to throb immediately.

At first, I thought I was dreaming. That I had hit my head somehow and this was some weird hallucination. But when I touched the walls, I felt the cold, rough texture of the wallpaper. This wasn’t a dream.

I tried walking, thinking maybe there was an exit. But every door I found led to more of the same—endless, sterile, identical rooms. I couldn’t find a single window. No matter how far I walked, the space stretched on and on, like it had no end. Every corner looked like the last. Every door, the same as the last.

Time didn’t seem to work here either. Hours, days, I couldn’t tell. My stomach growled, but I had no food. I yelled, screamed, hoping someone might hear me, but the only response was the relentless buzzing of the lights above and the echo of my own voice bouncing off the walls.

Then, I started to hear... *things*.

At first, I dismissed it as paranoia, the hum of the lights messing with my brain. But after a while, the sounds got louder. There were... footsteps. Slow, shuffling footsteps in the distance. Not human, not animal. They dragged, like something dragging its feet across the floor. I thought I was losing it.

But then I saw them.

At first, it was just a shadow darting at the edge of my vision, just out of reach. I would turn, and it would be gone. But eventually, I saw it for what it was—*a figure*. Tall, thin, with long, broken limbs, moving with an unnatural gait. It was always just far enough away to keep me from reaching it, but close enough to remind me that I wasn’t alone.

I tried running, but the rooms never seemed to end. And the figure was always there. Watching. Waiting.

At some point, I realized I wasn't the only one who had wandered into the Backrooms. There were others—lost, desperate, broken. But they weren’t like me. They were... *changed*. Their eyes were hollow, like they had been here far too long, and their faces wore twisted smiles. One of them whispered something I couldn’t quite hear, but the tone of their voice was full of *warning*.

There’s something in here, they said. Something that takes you if you’re not careful.

I asked them how long they’d been here, but they didn’t answer. The only thing they did was point—toward the darkened hallway, where the lights flickered and buzzed louder. And then, they were gone. Just... vanished.

I don’t know how much time has passed since then. I’ve lost track of it all. I stopped looking for exits. I stopped looking for the others. The only thing I care about now is the figure, the thing that stalks me through the endless hallways, just beyond my reach.

I think it’s getting closer.

And now, I know. I’m never getting out.

The hum is louder tonight.

Please, if you’re reading this, don’t think I’m crazy. The Backrooms are real. And once you fall in, there’s no way out.

I just hope someone finds this before *it* does.",3,1738515739.0,backrooms,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I have a relationship of ups and downs since April. We met in the city we lived and then she went away (5hr train) for work. So we became sorta long distance.

That was fine, because I wanted to make it work. I was unemployed at the time so I had more possibilities and occasions to visit her than viceversa. I spent a lot of time travelling from the two cities, often in the very first morning. I always participated in the expenses and never lived as a leech in her new house. I did this always and only for love, the discomfort was pretty much non existent when I thought of her face, voice and smile.

But there always has been a problem. She never came in my city (and hers) only for me. It was always some occasions where she made some time for me, like sleeping one night then going to family, with friends, etc. I was never not okay with her doing her things, of course. I was not okay, though, with her never coming for me as the first reason, and in a long distance relationship I value that. The commitment I feel must be somewhat reciprocated.

So, fast forward, since some times we didn't had a coffee, a beer, a dinner out, a night out in our original city where we met and I live. She comes down for her sister's birthday and sleeps at my place. The day after she went to family, hangs out with a friend for dinner then sleeps with me. 

Now, for the remaining time our plans where: go out after lunch, have coffee we two, hang out, walk in the city, find a present for her sister. I was excited! How much I longed for something like this! 

Then, her friend of the night before calls.
She stand up from the kitchen and goes picking up the phone. I overhear that she tells her that yes, we are totally fine going for a coffee in the center with her and her mother. I was very bitter. So, she hangs the phone with our new plans ready and comes back to eat. I then tell her I didn't quite like to be left out of plans that involves me and other people when we had our day planned, our day in the city since...months?

She lashes out. She starts raising her voice, accusing me of being antisocial, controlling and a man that wants her secluded and isolated from her friends. She even made comments, almost screaming, about how her exes were involved with her friends and family (her exes she described like abusives), while I don't want it. I felt gutted and hurt and like crying. I try to calm the tones and to talk, to resolve this like a couple, not with throwing plates. She bolted out the door to go without me at the coffee, saying that she didn't want to see even my shadow. I am devasted.

The evening at the party she kisses me in the lips in front of everyone and everything seems like a dream. I can't believe she can switch this way. I feel almost revolted not by her but by me that stand those situations. She doesn't seem to want to apologize and I tried to talk about it the next day, because I am hurt, but she seems okay with what she did and somehow I was the one at fault for even thinking that she should have like asked me if I was okay with the imminent change of plans (I would have been totally ok, it was a damn coffee, BUT ASK ME!)


Anyway, she comes from an abusive household for her mother's abusive and manipulative behaviors.

She doesn’t have a job and chooses to be jobless. 

I work full time and go the gym as soon as I’ve finished my work day. By the time I’m back home it’s 7pm. By the time I’ve showered and eaten it’s 8:30pm so I just end up getting ready for bed and lay in bed scrolling on my phone. 

On weekends I go for walks to get my steps in and then I clean my bedroom / do household chores like deep cleaning the bathroom (nobody else does chores and they’ll see things are dirty but won’t touch them). Keep in mind she’s always home so she could easily do the household cleaning. Sometimes (rarely) I’ll go out for a coffee with a friend if I’m having a walk with someone else. 

My AM constantly shouts at me saying I do nothing all day. She constantly accuses me of doing bad things because “I’m in my room all day”. Which is false I’m only in my room when I’m home and that’s because I get shouted at whenever I’m in my family’s presence. They’ll shout at me for all sorts of things and make fun of the way I look. They’ll joke about me to my face and laugh with one another so I just stay away from them in my room. She stopped including me in dinner since I was young I’m in my early 20s now. She makes dinner for my 2 younger siblings, my older sibling and her and my AD. She doesn’t make me anything and says I’m grown enough to make my own food. The only time she’ll tell me to eat is when there’s scraps / left overs she doesn’t want to go to waste so she’ll put on fake face and say “why don’t you eat something?” “Eat eat” but really it’s just the food at the bottom of the pot. 

I tend to buy my own food and even do the household food shopping when she needs because she’s constantly texting me a list whenever I’m out and says I’m selfish when I don’t get what she says. A lot of my food is horrible shop bought crap but I have no choice and she doesn’t allow me to cook for myself in the kitchen as she says I’m taking too long / making a mess when I’m not. 

Today I went for a 2 hour walk early morning and got home and started cleaning my room. She sent me a text saying “what do you do in your room all day” when I’ve not even been home all day to be in my room. She accuses me of speaking to ‘someone’ on my phone and even if I was what’s it to her? She never talks to me. Whenever I try to talk to her she’s completely silent and acts like I’m not right in-front of her. She’ll ignore me on purpose and no matter how much I try to make a conversation she just tells me to go away and move. She talks to everyone else and doesn’t talk to me.

1ig1sb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/1ig1sb8/small_breakdown_about_tariffs_partly_powered_by/,Small breakdown about tariffs (partly powered by claude coz its 2025),"the U.S. announced sweeping 25% tariffs **on all Canadian imports**, with a specific **10% tariff targeting the energy sector**. Canada's immediate retaliation outlines a two-phase response totaling $155 billion in counter-tariffs.  


**PHASE 1 - IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION (February 4, 2025): Canada targets $30 billion of U.S. goods with 25% tariffs, focusing on:**  
  
**\* Consumer essentials:** Orange juice, produce, alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, bourbon), coffee  
**\* Household goods:** Perfumes, apparel, footwear, furniture, appliances, sporting equipment  
**\* Industrial materials:** Lumber, plastics, pulp, paper products  
  
**PHASE 2 - 21-DAY DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION: A more substantial $125 billion in tariffs targeting:**  
  
**\* Heavy industry:** Automotive sector (including EVs), trucks, aerospace, steel, aluminum  
**\* Agricultural:** Beef, pork, dairy products  
**\* Strategic sectors:** Recreational vehicles, boats, critical minerals, energy partnerships

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:**

* Markets open in 15 hours (first price discovery)
* Phase 1 tariffs effective in 48 hours
* 21-day window before Phase 2 implementation
* Potential for diplomatic resolution during Phase 2 delay
* Long term attrition of the Canadian economy (depression era type beat)

**MARKET DYNAMICS TO WATCH:**

* CAD/USD exchange rate pressure
* Cross-border supply chain disruption
* Inventory stockpiling ahead of Phase 2
* Consumer sentiment shitting the bed
* Retaliation and tariffs increase.
* New trade partnerships with foreign nations.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**BULL THESIS:**

* Companies with strong pricing power can pass costs to consumers
* Domestic suppliers about to feast (both sides of border)
* if Inventory is sitting pretty because they loaded up pre-announcement
* Companies that can quickly shift supply chains locally

**BEAR THESIS:**

* Companies with thin margins about to get clapped
* Heavy cross-border dependency = pain
* Anyone caught with low inventory when tariffs hit
* Consumer discretionary might get rekt when prices spike
* exposure/vulnerable to fx volatility

My wife says I’m not the same anymore. I barely sleep, haunted by nightmares. She convinced me to see Dr. Maggie Lane, a psychiatrist she met at a coffee shop.

Maggie’s house is massive, perched on a mountain overlooking the entire town. She greets me warmly, guiding me to her living room, where I sit with the town sprawled below. When she asks why I’m here, I dodge the question, blaming stress. But she doesn’t let it go.

“It’s the Smith family case, isn’t it?”

I hesitate. Then, I begin.

A month ago, a woman called 911. “Something’s wrong,” she whispered before the line went dead. We traced the call to the Smiths’ home—a well-loved family of four.

When we arrived, the house was eerily quiet. We broke in. Mr. and Mrs. Smith lay in pools of blood. Their son, Jake, sat motionless, gripping a bloody knife. Their daughter, Emily, was laughing. Maniacally.

We took them in, but Jake never spoke. Emily never stopped laughing. The case made no sense. If the children did it—why? If not, who else was there? And who was the woman who called 911?

Maggie interrupts. “You said four. But the Smiths were a family of five.”

A chill runs through me.

“Their eldest daughter left two years ago. No one knows what happened to her.”

The press ran wild with the case, but even the police were lost. Then, we found something—surveillance footage. Days before the murders, a hooded figure lurked outside the house, always watching. We searched further and discovered CDs—home videos of the family. But in some, there was someone else. A shadow in the background. Always wearing the same hoodie.

I shift in my seat—and freeze.

There, under Maggie’s adjacent sofa, is a crumpled hoodie.

My breath catches.

And then my eyes land on the package by the door.

The name on the label—Maggie Lane Smith.

My stomach twists.

I look at Maggie. She’s still, an eerie calm settling over her.

Then, she smiles.

“Joshua,” she says softly.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

This thing literally happened overnight when I didn't take any supplements. I had no history of mental illness. nobody in my family has mental illness as well. I don't have any head trauma or injuries or anything like that. I didn't take any kind of supplements or anything like that at all prior to this. I don't know why this is happening. I literally don't feel any orgasm at all or sexual attraction after ejaculation.

I realize that this mental block in my head is not only prohibiting my learning but other parts of my mind as well. I am struggling with satisfaction activities, even if they are low dopamine. I struggle with meditating, and I struggle with learning and focusing better. I struggle with being in the moment. I am so messed up and this is hard to explain a lot honestly. I really feel like my situation is hard to describe but it's just some weird altered state of my mind that's been tampered with and I do things out of nowhere. I don't feel the way I would usually feel when doing these activities and it just happens out of nowhere with no single negative thoughts about these daily things.

When I am learning things on my own or meditating or something like that, I am physically doing it but it's like I can't ""feel"" it. I am meditating and I can't ""feel"" like I am meditating. I am trying to learn and study but I am not ""feeling"" like I am doing it or like the process is going on. I just slept. When I was dreaming, I feel like I am connected or something, like I haven't really slept or have a good idea of what I am experiencing. I feel weird. I couldn't discern whether I was in reality or not.

I tried to drink a cup of coffee today and then I felt some effects of being alert for some time. After 25 minutes, the effects of being alert and cognitive improvement started to waver on and off. It later became diminished to a low point that I couldn't recognize it anymore. I later drank two cups of coffee and a red bull that was 16 ounces and I don't feel the hyper effects. I was feeling it after one cup of coffee this morning and I was feeling something. Then suddenly, I felt like the effects literally decreased randomly out of nowhere and it doesn't make sense because I haven't had coffee in years! I took the red bull and still feel nothing. This is tied to my situation of feeling diminished experiences out of nowhere. I also took some recreational psychedelics (LSD) from my friend for effects but I didn't feel a damn thing even though I have done acid before and felt the full power of its effects (visuals, euphoria, etc). I feel like I literally woke up one morning and lost my sensations and my brain interprets everything differently now.

I’m Paolo, a journalism student, and I need to do an interview in English as part of an assignment for my English class. The thing is… I’ve been struggling to find someone willing to do it, so Reddit is kind of my last hope.

It’s super casual—just a quick 12-13 minute conversation where I ask a few questions. I’ll have a list of questions with me, but the idea is to have a real discussion. The interview can be about anything: one of your passions, your job, or even just about who you are. For example, if we talk about your profession, I might ask about what it involves, the challenges, debates, or controversies around it—but nothing too uncomfortable, don’t worry!

We can do it anywhere in Paris, and if you’re up for it, we could even grab a coffee (my treat!).

I guess I'm writing this to seek some sort of insight into a Capricorn's mindset and what they want from me.

I got a Capricorn coworker that seems pretty friendly, but I get this hot-cold vibe from them? As in, I think they want to be friends or something outside of work, but I'm not sure if I'm reading them right.

For example, there are conversations between us that last a good few hours throughout the day. But it's very largely driven by them and they control the narrative. They talk a lot to me. I take an active listening role and ask follow up questions, and such, but it's not as if I get time to talk much about myself. If I try to put my own personal spin on things, it's not really reciprocated or they go back to talking about what they want to talk about. Sometimes the topics are personal like what they do outside of work, their plans, or hobbies. Other times, it's about work. And they love telling me their work accomplishments or achievements, or even sharing their management or work philosophy with me. I think they have a high professional opinion of me, at least, because I've heard from others that my coworker has talked at least once positively around other managers and the like.

They do engage me. It feels spontaneous, but there's a sixth sense in me that says they're making a point to reach out to me... even for a few minutes. But I get mixed signals. On the occasions I reach out to them, it feels 50-50 if they're going to chat it up with me or tell me they're busy or don't have time.

Granted, we're at work and I understand the job takes priority over everything. But even so, there are times I see them act warmly towards me like making eye contact really well with me. And other times, they turn suddenly reserved or stoic. It's not consistent, and I'm not sure how to approach it.

I'd like to establish a personal rapport, but it feels like they're dancing around it for whatever reason. I was thinking of trying to reach out once a week to chat or offer coffee/lunch to get 1:1 time, will that be received well? Or will it be too much for a Capricorn?",1,1738514797.0,capricorns,0,1.0,False
1ig1e7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ig1e7k/i_26f_cant_figure_out_what_he_25m_wants/,I (26F) can’t figure out what he (25M) wants,"First of all, please excuse my English it’s not my mother tongue language, but I wanted to ask for advice on a situation, what does he want? Ok, so i will start from the begging of the story. 
I met this guy five years ago on a dating app, we did chat and go on dates for a couple months, which eventually led to some more intimate interactions. During the time we were chatting and dating he would not be consistent, he would disappear for a day, he didn’t make it a priority to see me, always last minute kind of ‘would you like to grab coffee” and stuff. But when we would go on dates everything would go smoothly, we would have a great chat and he really seemed like a nice guy. I would cut the story short on that and say that eventually he did tell me that he didn’t see me as more than a friend and that he wanted to keep the friendship that we had. Unfortunately by that time I already had started to have feelings for the guy (I know, big mistake, learned my lesson at the time, but let’s say I didn’t have much experience). I was hurt, as you can probably tell, but I said okay, that’s fine and I thanked him for the honesty, and I moved on (or so I thought for a while). 
Again cutting the story short, a year later after I met him, I did get into a relationship with someone, that relationship lasted 3 years, but I ended it for unrelated to the story things. But during my relationship he texted me how I’m doing, what’s going on with my life and etc., he asked me if I wanted to grab coffee and I agreed (yes, I know that I shouldn’t have done that). After that we continued with our life,he didn’t text me after we last had coffee and I did see he got into a relationship (actually he told me he had 2 relationships during those 3 years). 
So I ended my relationship in mid August and I honestly was tired of dating/relationship and I just wanted to focus on myself, get on with my life, have fun and I didn’t want any commitments, didn’t want to date. In November the guy texted me out of the blue again with how’s it going, what’s up, etc. I guess he saw that I deleted my pictures with my ex. I did respond without really caring about him just to be nice, we chatted for a few days, after that nothing. 
He texted me again 3-4 days after new years to say happy new year and again he continued with conversation. One Sunday after 2-3 days of not texting he asked me if I wanted to grab coffee the same afternoon, I agreed. He wanted to come pick me up, he did pay the bill even tho I insisted on paying for what I had. I was actually distant and he was the one to initiate the hug for a hello and after that when he dropped me off , be friendlier, happier to see me, I was trying to maintain distance and keep just a friendly conversation, nothing more, because in my mind we were going out as friends. I mean after the last time when he told me he saw me just as a friend, that’s what I considered him as. After he dropped me and got home he texted me he was glad we saw each other and that he would like to see me again soon. He then texted Monday through Wednesday and after that nothing. The next Monday he texted again and again it continued until Wednesday. And the messages were far from just friendly texts, they definitely were going to a playful direction. And honestly I was fine with that, if he wants just to have a friends with benefits kind of situation I am okay with that. I already got the idea that probably he doesn’t want a relationship with me. 
But he was confusing me, again. He would text Monday through Wednesday and then nothing. So I decided to text him Sunday to ask if he wanted to grab lunch or something. I did that because I was discussing with friends that maybe he wants something but I should also show that I’m interested and text him. He said that he had plans with his friends, it would be likely they cancel on him and he would text me if the plans got ruined so we can grab something. He straight up lied to me, because the whole afternoon we carried a conversation but not once he said he’s going out with them or that they canceled. I will repeat myself for the hundred time, but he again texted Monday through Wednesday constantly and then disappeared. 
So the question is what does he want? I am starting again to get consumed by him and I don’t want that but curiosity is getting the better of me. I know I should probably cut contact with him but I really want to know what is his game, how far he wants to take this.

Since then she's in a cycle of depression and unreliable mood swings, while I count myself as more stable.

We always had some fights here and there, and as a result she most of the time ghosts me but then again most of the time she comes back again leave it behind. These are sometimes small things and sometimes larger stuff where both of us voiced the possibility of divorce multiple times in the past. But we move on with life and stayed together always give it one more chance. When we are good, we're good. When we're bad, we're really bad. And I fell like the latter got a bit more frequent.

We have just moved to a new house since January which is a town house with several floors, this was a good change for both of use since there is now more room for everyone in the house for hobbies and for living.

She's a smoker and she also smokes weed and we have made an agreement that she would stop smoking weed after the move to new house, which she eventually broke with several arguments such as ""this is good for me"" ""I can only give myself a break with this"" etc. My reasoning why I asked her to stop smoking weed is, well, I don't want to smell weed all the time in the house and secondly the reason why she smokes is not healthy. She does not have a full time job and this makes her start smoking weed very early in the morning.

While we were moving to the house, we have agreed on me taking the top floor as my office, as I work from home, so it makes sense for me to get a detached space from the rest of the living areas to work. While she got the entrance floor as her private fitness studio, where she has students coming and going 2-3 times a week.

This leaves the middle floor which contains the living room, a bedroom, and a master bathroom which is connected through the bedroom. She started to have a habit of smoking the weed inside the master bathroom, taking beer and coffee with her and spend time in here. During this time, she started to voice her frustration about me going to the master bathroom, when I asked her why, she says that ""it's my personal space and I feel discomfort when you use it, you have your bathroom upstairs."" Btw, there is a third toilet on the ground floor.

I strongly believe that this is a huge red flag and told her that she can't have the bathroom for herself to smoke weed. I can use it anytime I like, because everything in the house is common and not off limits to anyone.

After I voiced this, she ghosted me again and distanced herself from me as if I committed a crime, and during this time she continued her weed breaks in the bathroom. This time she started to lock it from inside.

Yesterday, we had a really nice day outside and was having a good time, because she decided to outdistance herself after a argument about the own bathroom issue. However, we were back at the house, and I was in the middle floor where I needed to pee. I went there and used the master bathroom. I know that there are always cups and bottles and some stuff lying there in the floor, because she literally spends hours in there. Anyways there was this clutter again, which is still kind of fine, but I peed looking at a shit mark where you normally place your butt. I try not to use this toilet so much let alone shit in it because of how she makes me feel about this goddamn bathroom, so I know this mark is hers. What type of hurry you should be in to leave the toilet like this? (This was not the first shitmark that I saw there, she had a shit mark for a week straight using her depression as the reason)

I flushed it and made a remark to her that there is a shit mark over there, after which she immediately gets angry again and tells me ""Didnt I tell you how many times I feel disrespected when you go in there, yes I know it's a little bit dirty but its my own space and I dont feel comfortable you going in there and use it. You make me feel ashamed"".

I told her what I have already told her many times before that every room is a common place, even my office. I urge her to come upstairs and hang out in the office, play some music, use the bathroom, while I listen to her rant about how I am disrespectful to her because I don't listen to what she's asking.

After an energy consuming fight, I told her that if you want to have your OWN locked place, where only you can enter, maybe you need to get your own house. Some minutes later she comes to me and says ""Ok I decided and I want to divorce"" and then I said yeah ok, lets do it.

Until this time, I always had a fear about divorcing because I kind of hate big changes like this and believed that it can still work out, but in a situation like this, and after thinking about how it makes me feel like shit about myself over nothing, I really really think about finally getting that divorce. I think that we now have separate expectations from life and marriage.

What do you think I should do at this point? I feel like I am only left with this option now, and I never felt this close to a decision. I know it's one hell of a post but I needed some second pair of eyes to help me decide what to do next.

I have lots of energy, I get hunger craving only when laying in bed to save energy. I need to find activities to keep up with. Because at work, I feel the best. No food distractions,and I control the temperature, in my truck as a cdl driver. And so I always feel comfortable in the a/c etc...few headaches in the beginning, took acetaminophen and pushed on. 

15 lbs lost in 6 days, 8 more hours until I reach 7 days.ill most likely be down another pound, when I reach 7 days. 16 pounds in a week is crazy!! My goal is one month, i could potentially lose 64 pounds in one month. Once I am done, I'll continue with a dirty fast re feeding. So probably lose another 5-10. Then I'll start to do intermittent fasting and omad on weekends. I Will go from obese bmi, to healthy weight. And continue to eat healthy.

My routine
Black coffee once in the am 1/8 tsp salt - tastes better 
Followed by pickle juice shot for quick electrolytes 
Sip half a liter of electrolytes 
Drink 2 liters of regular water
Replenish electrolytes with the other hall of 1 liter electrolytes

Look at Brexit. Supporters believed leaving the EU was necessary, even if it hurt financially. Now, years later, everyday costs—milk, socks, coffee—have skyrocketed. 

Many regret their decision, realizing the burden wasn’t on politicians but on *them.*

Could Trump’s tariffs do the same to the U.S.? 

Some say it’s part of a bigger plan—manipulating voters while the economy weakens. When prices rise, will people blame those responsible, or will they be told to point fingers elsewhere?

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‘experiences’ such as restaurant meals, flights, hotels, coffee, beer at pubs, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more -**it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here: [https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately **£50 in credit** towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the **online experiences** such as flights, food deliveries, flower deliveries etc - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

Some good examples of redemptions I've personally used / I am planning on:

* Fancy massage parlour
* Various restaurants for lunches and dinner
* Ocean Bottle (akin to Chilly's) as a gift
* Freddie's Flowers

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months *premium* membership for **free** which provides **worldwide family travel insurance** when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per £1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You’ll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a **huge perk** and means you can get 2-3% cash back on **holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps. 

**Application Process** (Including Hard Credit Check)

1. Download Yonder App using the [referral link](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)
2. Verify Your Email & Details: Provide accurate information for verification.
3. Give some initial info and it performs a soft credit check to determine if you are eligible. If not, it will say so, so no need for a hard check.
4. Link Your Main Bank Accounts: This step ensures Yonder can offer you an appropriate credit limit.
5. Complete Identity Check: Take a quick selfie and provide a valid government-issued ID.
6. Undergo a Hard Credit Check: As with any credit card application, a hard check will be performed on your credit report.
7. Done

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you’ve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I’m really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I’m enjoying so much so that I’m I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be **accepted everywhere** that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I made my coffee while my husband finished cooking and as soon as I sat down to drink it, my cat jumped up to sit next to me. One of my sons came into the kitchen for breakfast, hugged me, and asked if I beat my high score on a game we both like.

1ig0vhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1ig0vhl/soundcore_by_anker_p20i_true_wireless_earbuds/,Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds review: Budget-friendly excellence or just hype?,"I’ve been testing the Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds daily, and let me tell you, they've been through all sorts of scenarios with me—from sweaty gym sessions to long work commutes. While I wouldn’t call them perfect, they’re definitely impressive for their price point.

The first thing that struck me was the sound quality. With the 10mm drivers, I wasn’t expecting much, but these earbuds deliver bass that’s surprisingly punchy for something this compact. The audio clarity is decent, though I noticed the highs aren’t as sharp as I’d like, especially for treble-heavy tracks. Listening to Led Zeppelin's ""10 Years Gone"" was enjoyable, as I could pick up the intricate layers of guitars, but if you’re looking for crisp cymbals or hi-hats, you might be left wanting more. Still, for casual listening, these earbuds hold their ground well.

[Is Soundcore by Anker P20i worth it? Check the price on Amazon now.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/soundcore-a3949-review-true-wireless-earbuds-with-big-bass/)

Fit and comfort are worth mentioning here. I’ve got pretty sensitive ears, and most earbuds irritate me after a couple of hours. These come with three different ear tip sizes, and I found the medium ones fit snugly without causing any discomfort. I even wore them during a 2-hour jog, and they stayed put—which is saying something because most earbuds tend to pop out halfway through my runs.

Battery life is a standout feature. With 10 hours of playtime on a single charge and up to 30 hours with the charging case, I’ve only had to charge them twice in a week despite using them for a few hours daily. On one busy day, I gave them a quick 10-minute charge and squeezed out two extra hours of music—perfect for those last-minute plans.

Connectivity is reliable too. Bluetooth 5.3 ensures a stable connection, and pairing them was as simple as opening the case. They automatically connect to the last paired device, which is a huge time-saver. However, I did notice a slight lag when using VLC for videos. It’s not a dealbreaker, but if you’re a stickler for perfect audio-video sync, it might bug you.

Noise cancellation? Well, there’s no active noise cancellation here, but the passive isolation works decently. They block out a fair amount of background noise, but don’t expect miracles if you’re in a loud coffee shop or on a bustling city street.

The touch controls are intuitive, and I loved being able to customize them via the Soundcore app. You can also switch between 22 EQ presets, which is a nice touch for tweaking the sound to your preference. I set mine to a bass-heavy preset for gym sessions and switched to a more balanced EQ for podcasts.

Water resistance is another plus. Rated as sweatproof, I felt confident wearing them during workouts without worrying about ruining them. Durability overall seems decent; they’ve survived being tossed into my bag multiple times, though the case does feel a bit fragile. I’d recommend being careful not to drop it too often.

**Pros**

* Great bass with customizable EQ options.
* Comfortable fit, even for extended use.
* Excellent battery life and quick charging.
* Reliable Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity.
* Sweat-resistant design, ideal for workouts.

**Cons**

* High treble detail is lacking.
* No active noise cancellation.
* Case feels slightly flimsy.
* Call quality isn’t the best due to average mic performance.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Stacking them up against competitors in a similar price range, like the JLab Go Air and TOZO T6, the P20i stands out with its app customization and bass-heavy sound profile. The JLab Go Air might offer slightly better treble clarity, but the lack of app customization is a drawback. TOZO T6 excels in water resistance (IPX8), but its battery life doesn't quite match the P20i's impressive longevity. Compared to premium options like Apple AirPods or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the P20i can’t compete in terms of ANC or soundstage, but considering the massive price gap, that’s to be expected.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

For the price point, these earbuds are a steal. You’re getting features like app customization, long battery life, and solid sound quality without shelling out a fortune. While they may not rival high-end models, they deliver more than enough for casual users who don’t want to break the bank. If you’re someone who frequently loses earbuds or wants a reliable backup pair, the P20i is a fantastic option.

In terms of features, I tested the ""Find My Earbuds"" option in the app, which emits a sound to help locate a missing earbud. It’s a small but incredibly handy feature that saved me from a mini heart attack when one of the earbuds slid under my couch.

I’m a professional and a high value male. I’m not here to make friends or crack jokes—I’m here to succeed. I dress well, I work hard, and I don’t waste time on the nonsense that most people seem to thrive on.

One of those people is Matt (21M), my coworker. He’s the golden boy—always joking, always acting like he’s the life of the party. He doesn’t have the work ethic, the discipline, or the focus that I do, but somehow he’s the one everyone listens to. He’s always cracking jokes, and for some reason, people love it. It drives me crazy.

Yesterday, in a shift meeting, I suggested a solid idea about streamlining some of our processes. Something that could actually make a difference and show I’m trying to improve things. The assistant manager seemed to be on board—until Matt, of course, had to make one of his ridiculous comments.

He said:
“Wow, look at you, Mr. Efficiency! Next thing we know, you’ll be optimizing the break room vending machine.”

Everyone laughed.

It was a stupid joke that wasn’t even funny—and I was the only one who wasn’t laughing. I had just made an actual meaningful suggestion, but because of Matt’s dumb little joke, everyone forgot about it. I was fuming.

So, after the meeting, I walked past Matt in our store’s locker room and said, “Maybe next time you can try contributing something of value instead of just trying to be funny all the time.” He just grinned and said, “Lighten up, dude.”

I tried to keep it cool, but that comment kept grinding on me for the rest of the day. And when I saw my chance when he left his gym bag sitting on the floor of the locker room, ready to leave and I snapped.

I walked past it and “accidentally” bumped the coffee cup sitting on the bench above it and, of course, it spilled all over his gym bag.

It was a big spill, and enough to leave a nice, brown stain on his bag and hopefully soak through to whatever was in it. Matt was furious.

He immediately jumped up, looking at his gym bag like it was the end of the world. He started shouting, “Dude, are you serious?!” But I just stood there, acting like I had no idea what had happened, and said, “Whoops! Guess I didn’t see that coming.”

He was pissed and actually mad and a few people finishing their shift or on lunch were starting to look over at us. But Matt didn’t say anything else, and he just grabbed some cloths to wipe it up, looking like a complete mess.

I felt satisfied.

Now everyone at work is talking about how I “spilled” coffee all over his stuff, and people are starting to look at me weird. Matt hasn’t really mentioned it to me directly, but I know he’s been telling everyone else about it. I know some people think I went a little too far but honestly he embarrassed me first.

If I’m being real, I’m not even sure I’m sorry about it. But now I’m the one being treated like the bad guy.

I might be too old for socials to be my main digital whirlpool, but I have a similar problem I see some of you posting about, relating to the news. You don't want to feel like you're missing anything. I don't want to feel that way about what might have been happening in the world while I was sleeping! I finally hit on a solution that's working for me as of now - the daily newsletter. I use one from NYTimes; the only possible temptation is they embed links in the newsletter, but thus far I've been able to not click them. I basically need one little hit of up-to-date content and stimulation to complete my morning coffee ritual, and this works for me. So I'm wondering if anybody has come across (an app? a browser extension??) something that similarly summarize or show the most recent or most popular posts on a social media site. If so, maybe that could help those who have trouble with these sites.",0,1738513148.0,digitalminimalism,0,0.5,False

Let me know what you think.

**Skin and Bones by David Kushner** \- “Limiting ourselves to the kiss only makes it that much more intense, like we’re both desperate to elicit every sensation possible in the simple yet infinitely complex connection of our mouths.” - ch18

*“Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical/ Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close”*

*“Lord, forgive me, I know my flesh needs to die”*

*“My salvation won’t be sacrificed”* 

**Don’t Blame Me** **by Taylor Swift -** “‘They hurt you,’ he whispers without apology. ‘They were going to kill you’.\[...\] Xaden’s eyes flash open. Red rims his irises and consumes the gold flecks I adore so very much, but he’s still him behind these eyes.” -ch 27

*“Don't blame me, love made me crazy/ If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right/ Lord, save me, my drug is my baby/ I'll be usin' for the rest of my life”*

*“For you, I would cross the line/ I would waste my time/ I would lose my mind/ They say, ""She's gone too far this time""*

**Unholy by Sam Smith and Kim Petras -** “What else can you do with those shadows, Lieutenant Riorson?” - ch. 11

*“Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot/ At the body shop, doing something unholy”*

**Lovely by Billie Eilish and Khalid -** “It’s almost like this room is removed from time itself, a tiny corner of the world where we simultaneously live together yet don’t. The only indication months have passed is the glass box from Zehyllna on his nightstand, and the emerald-hilted Blade of Aretia resting within. It’s missing a single stone near the top \[...\].” -Ch 47. 

*“Thought I found a way/ Thought I found a way out (found)/ But you never go away (never go away)/ So I guess I gotta stay now/ Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here/ Even if it takes all night or  hundred years/ Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near/ Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear”* 

*“Isn't it lovely, all alone?/ Heart made of glass, my mind of stone/ Tear me to pieces, skin to bone/ Hello, welcome home”*

**State of Grace by Taylor Swift -** “I’m not ignoring my fate. I know there will come a point in time where I’ll become more *it* than me. \[...\] but as dangerous as hope is, you’re right– I have to fight for this. I think I’m stable for now \[...\].” -ch. 48

*“We are alone, just you and me/ Up in your room and our slates are clean”*

*“This is a state of grace/ This is the worthwhile fight/ Love is a ruthless game/ Unless you play it good and right/ These are the hands of fate/ You're my Achilles heel/ This is the golden age of something good and right and real”*

*“So you were never a saint/ And I've loved in shades of wrong/ We learn to live with the pain/ Mosaic broken hearts/ But this love is brave and wild”* 

**Venom by Eminem -** “I’m not your backup plan. \[..\] You are the duke. I am the rider. That’s how it was always meant to be \[...\] I will stand by your side and be your right-fucking-hand for the rest of our lives, but if you want a member of our family to hold that seat \[...\] you’d better hold your own shit together.” - ch. 55

*“I got a song filled with sh- for the strong-willed/ When the world gives you a raw deal/ Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""/ When it talks to you like you don't belong/ Or tells you you're in the wrong field”*

*“Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum/ And I'm not knowin' when I'm/ Ever gonna slow up and I'm/ Ready to snap any moment I'm/ thinkin' it's time to go get 'em”*

*“It’s evident, I'm not done/ venomous, the thoughts spun/ Like a web and you just caught in 'em”*

**7 Minutes in  Hell by Chrissy Costanza**

*“When you kiss me, I can feel fire within me/ Heaven's got me burning/ Yeah, you got me playing seven minutes in hell/ Touch me/ Bringing me down to my knees/ Love the taste of sinning/ Yeah, you got me playing seven minutes in hell”*

*“Close your eyes/ I'm gonna be your favorite vice/ Forbidden from your paradise/ You wanna take a little bite?/ Close the door/ Oh, drop your halo on the floor/ No you don't need it anymore/ I'll never leave you needing more”* 

**Trouble by Camylio** 

*“Swear she might kill me/ But at least I'll die with a smile/ Never been so free/ As when I have her by my side/ She's gonna be the death of me/ I call her trouble /She knows exactly what she's doing to me/ Oh, I'm in trouble / The moment I met her, oh, I could not believe/ How sweet trouble could be/ What can I say/ Couldn't give her up if I wanted to/ She's got her ways/ To make all her wishes come true/ She’s gonna be the death of me”*

**Sacrifice by Black Atlass and Jessie Reyes -** “‘Bathtub,’ he says with a devious grin. ‘Then the dresser. Then the bed.’” ch 49

*“I will never sacrifice my love, not even for you/ You know I don't play it safe/ Sometimes you have to break the rules/ So let me, let me just lay you down/ Turn me on, take it all tonight*

*How do you make dangerous look so beautiful?/ And how come when you kiss, you turn me into this?”* 

**Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar -** “‘How could you align yourselves with this? \[...\] Abomination.” - ch 42

 *“No you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer/ The family matter/ and the truth of the matter/ it was God’s plan to show y’all the liar”* 

*“They not like us”*

**Lose Control by Teddy Swims -** “‘If I’d been there, beyond the wards, I would have drained the very earth to its core to keep you safe.’” - Ch. 12

*“Something's got a hold of me lately/ No, I don't know myself anymore/ Feels like the walls are all closin' in/ And the devil's knockin' at my door,”*

*“Yeah, it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep/ From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know”*

*“I lose control/ When you're not next to me”*

**Too Sweet by Hozier -** “‘Are you preparing for your own demise?’ ‘Yes. \[...\] But I’m not embracing the fall, if that’s what you’re thinking. I won’t give up a single day I have with you.’” Ch. 55

*“If you’re drunk on life, babe, I think it’s great/ But while in this world/ I think I’ll take my whiskey neat/ My coffee black and my bed at three/ You’re too sweet for me.”* 

*“I wish I could go along, babe, don’t get me wrong/ You know you’re bright as the morning, as soft as the rain”* 

**You’re Losing Me by Taylor Swift** \- “‘*There is no cure for me.’* He presses a kiss to my forehead. *‘That’s why you have to become better than me. There’s only you.’”* \-Ch 39

“Andarna is gone. I don’t leave our room for the next three days. I barely leave our bed.” ch. 54

*“You say, ""I don't understand, "" and I say, ""I know you don't""/ We thought a cure would come through in time, now I fear it won't/ Remember looking at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light/ Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time”*

*“Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?/ I'm getting tired even for a phoenix/ Always rising from the ashes/ Mending all her gashes/ You might just have dealt the final blow”*

*“Stop, you're losing me”*

**Come and Get it by Selena Gomez -** this is giving me Theophanie and Violet vibes. Either Violet springing the trap or Theophanie saying just join and come ask her what she wants to know. 

*“When you’re ready come and get it/ You ain’t gotta worry, it’s an open invitation/ I’ll be sitting right here real patient/ All day, all night, I’ll be waiting standby”* 

**We Go Down Together by Dove Cameron and Khalid -** “‘*I love you*.’ Violet’s voice cracks the cold, and a silken thread of warmth wedges itself in the opening before it seals shut, locking it in place.”  ch. 65

*“Am I really mine? Are you really yours? If all your emotions cut straight to my core/ Times when you cry, I feel it all/ Whenever you leave me I wait for your call”*

*“You are everything I’m living for”*

*“If we go down/ then we go down together/ if you hold on/ I might just stay forever”*

**Paint it Black by Hidden Citizens and Ranya -** “In my final act of resistance, I become the very thing I despise. Maybe it’s good that I can’t feel a damned thing. \[...\] Shadow streams through the canyon, thick as tar and black as ink, blacking out the afternoon sun and turning the space pitch-black.” ch 65

*“I look inside myself and see my heart is black/ I see my red door, I must have it painted black/ Maybe then I’ll fade away and not have to face the facts/ It’s not easy facing up when your whole world is black./ No more will my green sea turn to a deeper blue/ I could not foresee this thing happening to you/ If i look hard enough into the setting sun/ My love will laugh with me before the morning comes”*

**Better Love by Hozier -** “‘Will you forsake me now?’ \[...\] *‘We will ask,’* Sgaeyl finally says, flexing her claws in the rocky soil. *‘And her decision will determine our fate.’”* Ch. 65

*“ But you were mine, staring in the blackness at some distant star”*

*“There’s no better love/ That ever has loved me”*

**No Time to Die by Billie Eilish -** “\[...\] there are murdered dragons and riders, missing riders and missing eggs? Xaden wouldn’t do that. Would he?” Ch 66

*“You were my life, but life is far away from fair. / Was I stupid to love you?/ Was I reckless to help?/ Was it obvious to everybody else?“*

*“Are you death or paradise?/ Now you’ll never see me cry/ There’s just no time to die”*

**Peace by Taylor Swift -** *“‘And you think she’ll help?’ ‘She loves me.’”*  ch 65

*“I never had the courage of my convictions/ As long as danger is near/ And it’s just around the corner, darling/ Cause it lives in me/ No, I could never give you peace”* 

*“All these people think love’s for show/ But I would die for you in secret”*

*“Your integrity makes me seem small/ You paint dreamscapes on the wall”*

1ig0r1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortNovelsAndStories/comments/1ig0r1b/the_crimson_clue/,The Crimson Clue,"The blood was still warm.

I crouched beside the body, latex gloves snapping against my wrists. Senator Harlan Whitmore lay sprawled across his Persian rug, a single stab wound to the heart. Clean. Professional. But it wasn’t the knife that caught my eye—it was the symbol carved into his palm. A circle with three intersecting lines, smeared in his own blood.

“Another one, Detective Marsh?” Officer Chen muttered, snapping photos.

“Third this month,” I said. The first two victims had been a judge and a CEO. Same symbol. Same precision. The press called it coincidence. I called it a pattern.

The note arrived at my desk an hour later.

No postmark. Just my name in crimson ink. Inside, a riddle: *“Seek the key where the guilty sleep. The truth lies beneath the lion’s keep.”*

My coffee turned to acid in my throat. The lion’s keep. The old stone lion outside the city courthouse. And beneath it—the crypt of Elias Kane, the corrupt mayor hanged in 1923.

Rain lashed the cemetery as I pried open Kane’s weathered tomb. The smell of damp rot hit me first. Then I saw it: a ledger, bound in cracked leather, placed neatly on the coffin. Names filled the pages—politicians, bankers, cops. All dead within the last decade. All with that damn symbol in their files.

A shadow shifted behind me.

“You shouldn’t be here, *Detective*.” The voice was smooth, female.

I turned, but she was gone. Only a crimson scarf remained, monogrammed with the same three-lined circle.

Captain Briggs slammed the ledger on his desk. “This is a list of suicides. Accidents. Natural causes. You’re chasing ghosts, Marsh.”

“Ghosts don’t leave riddles,” I said. “Or symbols.”

He leaned closer, whiskey on his breath. “Drop it. Or I’ll reassign you to parking tickets.”

That night, someone firebombed my car.

The woman from the crypt found me at a dive bar.

She slid into my booth, her scarf masking half her face. “You’re persistent.”

“And you’re a lousy tour guide.” I tapped the symbol on my napkin. “What’s this? A secret handshake?”

“The Triune Knot. A society older than this city. They don’t kill people, Detective. They erase them.”

“Why?”

She dropped a key on the table. “Ask the lion.”

The key fit the courthouse archives.

Dust choked the air as I flipped through century-old trial records. Elias Kane’s trial transcript was missing. In its place: a photo of seven men in hooded robes, their hands clasped around a dagger. The Triune Knot.

A floorboard creaked.

I drew my gun. “Show yourself!”

Captain Briggs stepped into the light, his badge glinting. “Should’ve taken the hint, Marsh.”

The bullet grazed my shoulder.

I ran, blood soaking my sleeve. Briggs’s shouts echoed as I crashed into the alley. The woman was there, revving a motorcycle.

“Get on!”

We sped into the night, her scarf whipping my face. “They own the police. The courts. *Everything*.”

“Who’s *they*?”

She didn’t answer.

Her apartment smelled like jasmine and gun oil.

“Ana,” she said, tossing me a bandage. “And before you ask—my father was a Knot member. He tried to quit. They made it look like a stroke.”

I studied the symbol tattooed on her wrist. “Why help me?”

“Because you’re the first idiot who didn’t look away.”

The ledger’s names led to a shipping magnate’s mansion.

Ana hacked the security system while I picked the lock. Inside, velvet drapes framed a portrait of Elias Kane. Behind it: a vault.

The combination was the riddle’s answer—*guilty sleep*. 1923.

The door opened.

Files. Photos. A list of current members.

Senator Whitmore’s name stared back.

Ana’s knife pressed to my back.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

The room spun. Triune Knot members emerged from the shadows, Briggs at the front.

“Welcome to the reckoning, Detective.”

They offered me a choice: join or die.

I spat at Briggs’s feet. “Go to hell.”

Ana’s blade flashed. But it wasn’t my blood that spilled.",3,1738513073.0,ShortNovelsAndStories,0,1.0,False
1ig0qw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1ig0qw0/my_uncles_experience_with_mitolyn_surprising/,My Uncle’s Experience with Mitolyn – Surprising Results After 30 Days!,"I wanted to share a story about my uncle, Richard, from Austin, Texas. He’s 58 years old and has struggled with low energy and stubborn weight for years. He’s tried every diet, workout plan, and supplement you can think of. But nothing really worked long-term—until he found Mitolyn.

**How He Got Started**

It was back in October 2023 when he first heard about Mitolyn from a friend at his local golf club. He was skeptical at first because, let’s be honest, we’ve all seen those “miracle” supplements that promise the world and deliver nothing. But after doing some research and reading about how Mitolyn supports mitochondrial function (basically the powerhouse of our cells), he decided to give it a shot.

[Mitolyn Reviews](https://preview.redd.it/ed4xwxxp3rge1.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d72da17693dc20a7a4e278cb16236b89a778bcb)

**The First Week**

The first couple of days, he didn’t notice much. The taste was decent—he got the citrus flavor, which he said reminded him of a light orange juice with a hint of herbs. By day five, he started noticing something different: the usual afternoon energy slump wasn’t hitting him as hard. He didn’t feel the need to chug a coffee just to get through the rest of the day.

**Week 2-3: Visible Changes**

By the second week, things got even more interesting. He stepped on the scale and was down 4 pounds—not a drastic drop, but a steady loss without changing much of his diet. The real surprise came when he realized he wasn’t craving snacks like before. He used to reach for chips or sweets late at night, but now he felt satisfied with regular meals.

Another big change? His sleep improved. My aunt even commented that he wasn’t tossing and turning as much. That was unexpected but definitely a welcome benefit!

**One Month Later: The Verdict**

After 30 days, my uncle was down 9 pounds and felt more energized than he had in years. His metabolism seemed to be working better, and he was moving around with more ease. He even said his joints felt less stiff, which was huge for him since he loves golfing.

**His Final Thoughts:**

Energy levels? ✔️ Improved

Weight loss? ✔️ Steady progress

Hunger control? ✔️ Fewer cravings

Sleep? ✔️ Surprisingly better

**Is Mitolyn Worth It?**

Obviously, everyone’s body reacts differently to supplements, but for my uncle, Mitolyn was a game-changer. He’s continuing to take it, and as of last week, he’s down a total of 15 pounds. It’s not an overnight miracle pill, but it does support your body in a way that makes weight management easier.

If you’re considering trying Mitolyn, I’d say give it a fair shot—especially if you struggle with low energy and slow metabolism like my uncle did. Just remember, supplements work best alongside a healthy diet and some movement.

The colors in the backsplash tiles are much more orange and red than the listing and I’m not sure I can get past it. 
I lean quite goth in my aesthetic overall but love color and natural stone as well. So I know it’s dark colors, will add under cabinet lighting. 

But here’s pics of my cab color, the listing photos, then the actual tiles alongside my hardware and a sample of countertop.

Both weren’t right but hey it’s okay. I was kinda bummed that we weren’t gonna get coffee today cause of his schedule but he followed up saying we could get something tomorrow. So I’m really happy. Cause back then when he was too busy he wouldn’t usually follow up with something different. Like he’d just tell me he’s too busy then leave it at that. So this change is really nice. I’m just happy. Happy happy happy. I’m getting jittery from the coffee. Sorry this is so scattered. I’m just so happy but also hyper. But also on cloud nine. 

Bro. I need to chill. This guy ain’t even my bf. But I wish he was. 🥲 lol. Jkjkjkjk. If he dated me it’d be out of pity like the rest of the guys. It really sucks he doesn’t see dating potential in me. But hey. It’s whatever. One day I’ll have someone to hold on Valentine’s Day. Maybe not this year but one year for sure. And hey who knows.

1ig0nei,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1ig0nei/zero_to_hero_bvi_style/,Zero to Hero BVI Style,"My wife and I had a great time spending ten days crewing on a bareboat cat trip with some friends last year, so we decided to learn how.   My previous sailing experience was minimal (a few times out on friends' 30'-ish monohulls).

They sent us the ASA 101, 103, 104, and 114 books and a link to an online 101 and 103 courses a few months in advance to study.    I have to say the ASA online courses are not the greatest (my wife is a professional educator) and the tests are just poorly constructed and in some cases, just outright WRONG.    I commented about this to ASA, but they ghosted me (not surprising; their customer service on ordering books and such is pretty poor and rude, even after they shipped me stuff I didn't order).

We also found some prep courses on Udemy which were pretty good I thought.   We this under our belt, and some practice tying knots (thanks for the person who posted the knot coffee cup picture, we got a couple of those).    My wife and I are a little competitive, so we both got in the high 90s on our written exams.

We were told to show up at fiveish and call our instructor.    We're spending the night on the marina to accommodate the variety of arrival times that the other students have.    We're first on so we get to choose which cabin and pick the starboard stern cabin on the Lagoon 46.   While this was listed as a couples class, the other students are two unaccompanied guys.   We go over the provisions and run over to the RiteWay to get a few last minute things we wanted.    Instructor makes sure we know how to use the marine heads but otherwise says we're at liberty until 8AM the next morning.   Several of us go out to dinner at  Peg Legs.

Next morning a representative of the yacht rental company goes over the boat with us:  all the systems, engines, emergency equipment, how to pump the holding tanks, etc...    Instructor takes us out and talks us through raising the sails.   Since we have four students (me my wife, and the two guys), we'll all take turns on different stations as we practice each skill repeatedly.    I volunteer to sweat the main up so I'm on deck.    We get under sail and then practice tacking on our way over to Norman Island.   Pretty good wind.    Get the sails down, and go to pick up the mooring ball and find the longest boat pole we have is about six feet long.   I'm on the helm/engines on that one and they barely are able to snag it.   It was at this point that we decide that since I'm 6'1"" and have the longest arms, I'll do the hooking for the rest of the week.   Off to pirates for dinner.

We come back from dinner and start up the generator and the water maker.   About 20 minutes into this the noise from the water maker stops.   Hmm.   Do some investigation and find that no AC power is working even though the generator.   Check all the breakers and such.   Finally, get the cover off the generator and try the main breaker there.   Nothing tripped.   Flipping the main breaker on the generator itself gets a brief blip of Ac power before it dies again.   Figure there is more wrong to the generator than we can fix, call the rental emergency number we were given but get no answer.   Figure we can survive without AC and have plenty of water.   DC house batteries are good and we have plenty of diesel if we need to recharge them.    Go to bed.

Wake up the next morning and call the rental place.   Since we're close they ask if we can just return so they can check it.   Another lesson in hoisting the sails and a few tacks on the way back to Nanny Cay.   Drop the sails and motor in.    Technician shows up and determines the control board is shot.   He replaces it and off we go again.   Winds have really picked up so we reef the main.   Lots of practice.   Now we were going to try to get to the Baths but given the generator delay and the winds not really in the right direction, we get there late.    We figure we'll anchor out nearby and hit there in the morning.   We all got a chance to work both the helm and the windlass to set and retrieve the anchor.

Next morning we dingy over to the Baths and swim in to tour that.   Last year the red flag was up so we didn't get a chance to do that (and the two other guys hadn't either).    Winds were light that day and on a broad reach, so we all took practice jibing both at the helm or on the lines.   Swing around and moor.  Dingy over to the Bitter End Yacht Club for some drinks and then over to Saba Rock for dinner.

Spend some time doing chart instruction in the saloon, measuring headings and bearings.   Get the bearing compass out and do some observations with that.    Also went over our exams so that everybody got coaching on what they got wrong.

Winds weren't going to accommodate us getting to Anegada, but Margy and I had been there.   We head over to Jost so everybody could go into the Soggy Dollar.    Came back and spent an evening tying knots. 

Next day, really windy.   Reef 2 on the main and one on the jib and more sailing practice, navigating, tacking for best VMG, etc...   Drop the sails and the instructor returns on deck with a fender with a life jacket tied to it and throws the ""man"" overboard.   Tells us that twice he's had other boats ""save"" his man and take off with it.   Anyhow, we all got a chance to do it.    Except on my turn, I've got the hook to retrieve the ""man"" once we're in position.

Go to our final mooring which will give us a short motor back to Nanny Cay since we have an early ferry to catch to leave.   After, getting shutdown one of the guys decides to go for a dip.   He digs through the locker full of pool noodles, swim fins, masks, and snorkles and notices something under all that stuff.    It's a boat hook that actually extends to a reasonable length.   Oh well, now that we don't need it any more, we know where it is.

I fire up the barbecue and throw some burgers on for people.   We had some avos that weren't ripe enough to use earlier on that seem OK, so I add some salsa, garlic, and lime juice and make a small amount of guac we can put on the burgers.   After dinner, the instructor signs off all our log books.

He goes over what we're going to have to do to turn in the boat.   Next morning I'm up (my job also was to fire up the coffee).   Instructor tells me to go start the engines and I do so and set up a route on the chart plotter to find Nanny Cay.    Everybody else is still moving slowly so he and I get the mooring lines off and I motor us over.    Call for the yacht guys to come out and I sit next to the guy and watch him masterfully get us to the fuel dock and then into space about a boat length and a quarter in the marina.

Agent comes on and does the check-in procedure.   We note a couple of minor discrepancies (chain counter wasn't working, but we knew that going out), the holding tank gauge on the starboard side always read empty (jokes about us needing to drink more), and to let them know that we had no further problems with the generator or anything else.

Cab shows up right at 10 and gets us to the ferry in plenty of time.   Only problem is that our flight from STT-CLT was delayed by five hours.   At least I got upgraded to First Class after all that.
