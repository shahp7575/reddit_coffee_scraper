When dialing the grinder in, I always have several shots that get tossed because the grinder was off. With roasting in such small quantities it just seems like a waste, and is a little annoying 

Do any (likely high end) grinders allow for saved grind size profiles, or is adjusting between roasts, or getting a second grinder my only option?

# MORE about - China restricting exports of critical minerals to US in response to chip restrictions

***Beijing halts supply of gallium, germanium, and antimony over dual-use concerns***

[China restricts exports of critical minerals to US in response to chip restrictions](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/china-restricts-exports-of-critical-minerals-to-us-in-response-to-chip-restrictions/3412793)

https://preview.redd.it/pucnibgsmt4e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7878cf9f31230095dca55d56cd7eb30ecb42ab5

**BEIJING**

China has announced export restrictions on critical minerals to the United States, countering recent US measures targeting its chip industry.

The Ministry of Commerce stated that the export of materials with dual military and civilian uses, including gallium, germanium, antimony, and super-hard materials, to US defense manufacturers is now prohibited.

Exports of graphite, which is essential for batteries and aerospace applications, will also face tight controls.

China justified the measures as compliant with its export control laws, asserting that they aim to safeguard national security and uphold international non-proliferation obligations.

As the world’s largest producer of rare metals—accounting for 70% of global output and processing 85%—China’s move could significantly disrupt supply chains.

A US Geological Survey (USGS) report warned that restricting gallium and germanium exports could cost the US economy $3.4 billion.

The Chinese government had already announced in August 2023 that gallium and germanium exports would be restricted, followed by graphite export controls in December.

**Response to chip restrictions**

China’s action is a direct response to US restrictions targeting its chip-making industry.

The US Commerce Department recently expanded its export controls, prohibiting the sale of 24 types of chip-manufacturing equipment and three categories of software essential for semiconductor production.

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo stated that the measures aim to curb China’s military advancements in cutting-edge technologies.

Beijing has condemned the US actions, accusing Washington of using export controls to suppress Chinese industries.

The Joe Biden administration has prioritized preventing the transfer of critical technologies to China, notably through the CHIPS and Science Act and broader investment restrictions.

Signed into law in August 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act has limited Chinese manufacturers’ access to advanced semiconductor technologies.

In August 2023, Biden issued an executive order restricting American companies from investing in critical technology sectors in China, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and microelectronics.

The leaders of Wyoming’s budding rare earth mining startups were feeling vindicated Tuesday after China announced a ban on exporting several critical minerals to the United States.

The Chinese ban announced Tuesday includes gallium, used to make semiconductors, and germanium, used for infrared and fiber optics technology. China also banned antimony, used for military explosives, and super hard materials like tungsten, used for armor-piercing bullets and shells.

China’s move followed the Biden administration further cutting off access to advanced American technology, adding 100 Chinese companies to a restricted trade list in an escalating tech war between the two superpowers.

“This kind of validates the momentum that is already going here in Wyoming,” Wyoming Rare (USA) President Joe Evers said. “And it also shows that domestic projects like those that are being undertaken in the state of Wyoming are so necessary and important for our economic prosperity and our national defense.”

Wyoming has a huge head start on other American states in developing rare earths mines and processing, Evers added, and its position at the front can only be a benefit in what is definitely becoming something of a rare earths arms race.

“Most folks take it for granted,” he said. “When you think about these resources, critical minerals and rare earths, they’re in our pockets, in our computers, and in our homes.

“It’s in our cars — whatever they might be. But I don’t think we appreciate how much lead time is necessary to bring these projects online.”

# Already Working

Wyoming also doesn’t have all its rare earth eggs in one basket. It has several projects already in the works.

The Halleck Creek project near Wheatland, for example, that Evers’ company is working to bring online, has the potential to be one of the [largest rare earth deposits](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/12/23/wyoming-rare-earths-deposit-has-potential-to-be-worlds-richest/) in the nation, if not the world. The U.S. government has already pledged [up to $456 million in financing](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/09/27/huge-wyoming-rare-earth-project-gets-450-million-loan-from-feds/) for the project.

Final assay results from the most recent core samples taken from the area have confirmed some of the highest-grade rare earth oxides to date at the location as it works to flesh out the business case for its mine, according to recent announcements by the company.

Concurrent with that effort, the company has continued to make “good progress” on the permitting side of things, Evers added.

“We’re getting everything teed up for additional exploration next spring and summer,” he said. “And we’re really focusing in on the metallurgical process of how we get metal out of these rocks that we’re working on out there.”

Then there is also Ramaco Resources, which has an unconventional rare earth deposit estimated to be worth at least[ $37 billion](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/11/26/37-billion-rare-earths-bonanza-may-only-be-the-beginning-for-wyoming-coal-mine/). 

Since then, the company has [revised its estimates](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/03/26/one-of-worlds-richest-rare-earth-deposits-in-wyoming-may-be-richer/) upward, from 800,000 tons of rare earths to more like 1.5 million tons.

While the Halleck Creek deposit doesn’t have any of the listed banned materials, Ramaco’s deposits include both gallium and germanium, both of which are among the more valuable rare earths.

# Wyoming Head Of The Pack

But it’s not just these rich rare earth mining sites that are putting Wyoming ahead of the game. There are also efforts to develop an entirely new, and cheaper, approach to the chemistry of refining rare earth minerals. 

That’s where the [recently finished](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/11/02/uptons-china-busting-rare-earths-demonstration-plant-is-officially-underway/) demonstration plant in Upton comes in. It, too, has received federal assistance for its mission to scale up an economically feasible approach to processing rare earths.

That’s been seen as critical to developing a domestic supply, more so even than the mining itself. China has long maintained a stranglehold on rare earth supplies by flooding the market with the minerals, choking out competitors by keeping prices so low, they can’t compete.

Rare Element Resources Vice President, General Counsel, and Chief Administrative Officer Kelli Kast told Cowboy State Daily her company views China’s latest announcement as a call to action for domestic sources and technology. And she’s excited to be part of helping to lead that charge here in Wyoming.

“It once again shows China’s intention to manipulate the market by putting export restrictions on key critical rare minerals,” she said in an email. “Because Rare Element Resource’s rare earth Bear Lodge deposit near Sundance and our proprietary processing and separation technology is wholly separate from Chinese sourcing and technology, we believe our demonstration project now underway in Upton is even more important, and then the development of our Bear Lodge Mine.”

***Given its proximity to the world-class Bear Lodge deposit, the town could one day be in line for a full-scale operations plant, if American Rare Earths’ process is proven out.***

https://preview.redd.it/jbykg1uhpt4e1.png?width=265&format=png&auto=webp&s=99908fc043dd7e2c69c5ac2c330cb14769f0eb63

OTTAWA, ON, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - China's recent decision to ban exports of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other high-tech materials with potential military applications in retaliation for U.S. restrictions on semiconductor-related exports, underscores the precariousness of global supply chains. This development highlights the vital role of the Canada-U.S. trade relationship in addressing supply chain vulnerabilities.

China's actions serve as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, particularly on the reliable supply of critical minerals. These materials are essential not only for technological innovation and economic growth but also for defense applications critical to national security.

Canada has long been a dependable partner, providing certainty to U.S. manufacturing and defense industries by serving as a major supplier of minerals and metals. In 2022, 52% of Canada's mineral exports—valued at over $80 billion—were destined for the U.S.. Strengthening the free flow of minerals and metals between Canada and the U.S. is more critical than ever.

Imposing tariffs on Canadian mineral and metal exports to the U.S. would run counter to the shared goals of secure and reliable supply chains. Such measures risk disrupting the essential flow of these resources, undermining the competitiveness of North American industries, and exacerbating vulnerabilities in critical mineral supply chains that both nations are working to address.

The partnership on critical minerals between Canada and the U.S. began in earnest with the development of the [Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals Collaboration](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4316856-1&h=362338770&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fnatural-resources-canada%2Fnews%2F2020%2F01%2Fcanada-and-us-finalize-joint-action-plan-on-critical-minerals-collaboration.html&a=Joint+Action+Plan+on+Critical+Minerals+Collaboration) in 2020 under President Trump. This collaboration has continued under the Biden administration, demonstrating the enduring importance of this strategic alliance. As the U.S. prepares for a new administration, we look forward to working closely with the incoming Trump administration to build on this foundation, ensuring the resilience of critical mineral supply chains and supporting shared economic and defense priorities.

""The minerals and metals industry in Canada stands ready to strengthen our partnership with the United States, ensuring the free flow of these essential resources that drive economic growth, defense capabilities, and technological advancement on both sides of the border.  The security and well-being of all Canadians and Americans depends on it."" said Pierre Gratton, President and CEO of MAC.

*The mining industry is a major sector of Canada's economy, contributing $161 billion to the national GDP and is responsible for 21 percent of Canada's total domestic exports. Canada's mining sector employs 694,000 people directly and indirectly across the country. The industry is proportionally the largest private sector employer of Indigenous peoples in Canada and a major customer of Indigenous-owned businesses.*

I've been getting variable results due to being a bit lazy developing my technique.  Face facts: at a quarter to six, I am still trying to achieve consciousness.  Trying to map my hair pattern on my mug takes more higher brain functions than I usually possess.  

But one perseveres.  My last shave was frankly a massacre.  New Astra, four days of growth, etc.  The Astras are the blades I settled on after futzing with a sampler pack.  Getting the Astras was actually a mini quest that meant going to a barber supplier in the Montreal Garment district.  Canada Post is on strike.  And I didn't feel like spending on courier charges for something right in the city.  A bit eerie since it felt like there was nobody in the building.  But the proprietor was fine with me buying from him even if I wasn't buying as a pro.  Barber Supply on Louvain if anyone is interested, BTW.

I switched to the kitchen sink because my bathroom sink is chronically slow.  I fill the sink with warm water as I prop my Walmart make up mirror on an empty coffee can.  Height of sophistication, folks.  I have just enough working brain cells to screw down the razor head before putting it into the sink to warm.  Yes, I have forgotten before.  And resolved not to do that again.  I load my brush from the Proraso Green tub before mug lathering 

I have face lathered.  But the mirror is a little too small to monitor that process compared to the one in the bathroom medicine cabinet.  I bought a two buck coffee mug at Walmart because the black matched the frame of the mirror.  I had some idea of using it to swish the razor clean between passes.  Didn't work.  So using it to lather it was.  Honestly, it's tedious.  I was not sure if I was doing it right the first test run or Monday's shave.  But ...I gave the lather some extra swirls after tapping the brush in my palm for peaks.  There was a visible phase change as the lather became that elusive whipped cream consistency.

I vigorously swirl the brush for exfoliation before switching to painting.  The Astra in the first pass doesn't feel sharp.  But it feels comfortable.  I go WTG, then XTG.  I try to vaguely confirm to the grain pattern of my face.  Then I go ATG.  It's how I was taught by my late father.  I am too used to it to change.  An exploratory stroke of my fingers finds minimal stubble on the jaw line.  It is a buggaboo for me.  I do several touch up passes on the corners of my mouth and the jawline there.  I also touch up the hollows behind the jaw beneath the ears.  Rinsing off with cold water, the alum finds a fair bit less sting and much less grating from missed spots than before.  Checking after putting in some Nivea balm finds a few lines.  But it feels good.  Looking in the bathroom mirror finds no weepers and a relatively clean neck.

I’m going through one of the hardest times of my life and I notice that I’m dopamine depleted. 
I’m crying everyday and am semi-suicidal. 

I’m going to get through this period sober and not go to caffeine, nicotine, alcohol or sedatives. Those will only serve as a band-aid and come with negative consequences immediately or down the line. 

Without any stimulants I’m calm and have energy throughout the day but I miss the highs sometimes even though I remember it as incredibly artificial. 

If I were to go on the coffee in the morning and the zyns in the afternoon, I would undoubtedly be happier because of them increasing dopamine. But I would suffer with anxiety, weird egoistical thoughts and other health consequences (elevated heart rate). 

I’m going to handle this period of my life through acceptance, presence and meaningful activities.

How do I keep up patience and not feel horrible in this?,"I can try to keep a long story short because it would be a lot to type out, tho I feel like there is a decent amount of context. I have been dating this woman since Sep. We became official in Oct. She lives in my apt complex and I can walk to her door in about 3 minutes. Up until Nov we hung out all the time, regular intimacy, calling each other pet names, I miss you's, etc. We talked daily both through text and long phone conversations. She warned me in the early part of Nov that she was going into this super busy period with work that could last through Dec 15, possibly the end of the year.



Nov. 16 rolled by and the busy time came. I expected to not see her as much, or maybe at all. But what I didn't expect is the shutdown. She stopped communicating. No I miss you's, calling me handsome, random texts to say she missed me. She started going days without talking to me. After that first several days I called her to ask her if she was ok, and if we were ok. She told me that we were ok, but that she has just felt completely shut down and hasn't wanted to talk to or see anyone. That she has been working 12+ hours a day 7 days a week.



I let her know how it was making me feel, and she apologized and said she would try to communicate more. I went over to her place that eve. Hung out for like 15 minutes, gave her a lil back rub and let her get back to work.

Communication got a lil better but still wasn't able to spend any time with her. And slowly her communication dwindled again. I went a whole weekend without hearing from her. The Saturday this happened I went to Target and bought a bunch of stuff for her to help her relax. A big hair clip, pjs and fuzzy socks, shower steamers, a new mug and tea, a gift card to her fav coffee shop, and I put it all in a basket with a card and her fav hoodie of mine. I texted her to ask if I could come bring her a surprise.

I didn't hear back till Sunday, to which she said she was still feeling relatively shut down and didn't want to see anyone. I told her I was just gonna bring something over and set it by her front door, that she didn't have to see me.

She texted the following day thanking me saying that it was sweet. But the level of communication has rarely if ever picked up. She spent thanksgiving with her Mom, and the following day I was getting off a bit early and she had texted me so I hit her up to see if I could spend a little time with her.

She said her Mom had asked her to hang out again, and she was on her way out. I asked if I could see her for a moment as she was leaving. She did stop by, and we kissed but the vibe was off and she wasn't the most affectionate. We spent all of five minutes chatting otherwise.

So as of now, communication is very little. I haven't heard from her in nearly four days. Last text from her was last Saturday . I am a bit upset with her because I feel neglected. I am trying to be empathetic because I know she is going through a ton with work. I feel bad about being critical of her though, and I feel selfish for wanting my needs to be met. Part of me worries that she is depressed and I haven't heard from her because she isn't ok. She has never said anything to make me think she would harm herself, but she has never gone THIS long without talking to me. I walk by her apartment with my dog because it is on our route and I haven't seen any lights on in her place since Sunday and her car hasn't moved.

This whole situation has just fucked my anxiety levels. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep bc I am wondering wtf is going on. I am so worried to bring anything up and push her away. I am starting to feel nauseous sometimes.

1h6e91g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityPals/comments/1h6e91g/how_to_create_a_morning_routine/,How To Create A Morning Routine?,"Hey everyone! I want to share something that completely transformed my life - creating a solid morning routine. I know it sounds basic, but trust me, it's been a game-changer for my productivity and overall wellbeing.

I used to be that person who'd hit snooze five times and rush out the door with barely enough time to brush my teeth. Not exactly the best way to start the day, right? But after lots of trial and error, I've figured out what actually works.

Here's my step-by-step guide to building a morning routine that sticks:

1. Start Small
Don't try to become a morning person overnight. I made this mistake and failed miserably. Begin with waking up just 15 minutes earlier than usual. Once that feels natural, add another 15 minutes. Small wins build momentum.

2. Prepare the Night Before
This is crucial! I lay out my clothes, prep my coffee maker, and plan my most important tasks for the next day. It eliminates decision fatigue in the morning and makes everything smoother.

3. Create Your Power Hour
The first hour after waking up sets the tone for your entire day. Here's what works for me:
- 10 minutes of meditation
- 15 minutes of light exercise
- 20 minutes of reading
- 15 minutes for planning and journaling

4. Stay Consistent
Weekends are tricky, but try not to deviate too much from your routine. I allow myself an extra hour of sleep on weekends, but still follow the same basic structure.

5. Track Your Progress
This has been absolutely essential for me. I've been using a habit tracker to monitor my morning routine, and it's amazing how motivating it can be. Speaking of which, I'm giving away a free Daily Habit Tracker spreadsheet through my newsletter at theexcellenceeffect.com - it's helped me stay accountable, and I think it could help you too.

6. Make It Enjoyable
Don't turn your morning routine into a chore. I love starting my day with a cup of good coffee and some quiet time. Find what brings you joy and incorporate it into your routine.

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Trying to change everything at once
- Not getting enough sleep
- Checking social media first thing
- Setting unrealistic expectations

Remember, your morning routine should energize you, not drain you. It took me about three weeks to really get into the groove, so don't get discouraged if it feels challenging at first.

The key is to be flexible and adjust your routine as needed. What works for me might not work perfectly for you, and that's okay. The goal is to find a rhythm that helps you start your day with purpose and energy.

I hope this helps! If you're interested in more productivity tips and personal development strategies, check out my newsletter. I share weekly insights about building better habits and achieving your goals.

1h6e6qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1h6e6qx/cooking_tips_from_a_homeless_chef/,Cooking Tips From a Homeless Chef ,"My brief background:
Been homeless, rubber tramped, a vagabond, and housed up sometimes for 30 years. I got a boat given to me a little over a year ago. I paid $17.75 to register it and transfer the title.

A couple caveats:This is for those than have a way to cook. Stove, camp fire, BBQ, etc. I know some people's situations keep them from doing this. Cooking really isn't as complicated as some make it seem.

Unfortunately if you don't have a way to cook you're gonna blow through you EBT pretty quick. It sucks, but that's the way it is. Find food banks, go to as many feeds a day as you can, get food stamps/EBT, panhandle, busk, ask people for food, fly a sign, etc. If the feeds suck go somewhere else. You're already homeless. You can go anywhere. People will generally hook you up if you hitchhike out of there with nothing.

Here's some tips for eating healthy while living on EBT/food stamps:

I live on a boat now, so I guess not 100% homeless. I don't have refrigeration at the moment. Also it's just me. 

My go to lately is canned soup/chilli, tortillas, cheese, and having some munchies and sugary stuff. I mostly drink water, have for years. I do throw some other drinks in sparingly, because you have to have some flavor. Seems to make a pretty balanced meal. It's dirt cheap per meal. ~$3. If I made soup it would be less then half the cost.

I also buy some lunch meat, spam, and hot dogs. Definitely not the best health-wise but gives a decent bit of meat protein. If I'm craving red meat I'll grab some ground beef, bacon and an onion. Voila, bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Condiments from the grocery store deli. (I buy ketchup and mustard. Mayo packets as needed.)

I'll toss in a Cuban from Publix here and there. Some cliff bars. 

I have coffee, cream, and sugar every morning. 

I own a small sauce pan/pot, a normal sized skillet (14""?), enough dishes for two people, and some cheap utensils. So cleaning isn't too bad.

I cook on a double burner camp stove. I only use one burner ever. I have a BBQ sized propane tank (20lb.?), but for cooking the green 1lb. tanks last me about 2 weeks. (~5 months for the big tanks)

I've been an executive chef a few times in different resorts. You can do fine dining from scratch cheaper than making cheap unhealthy food, if you have a way to cook and a place to store food. Maybe not lobster and Ribeyes, but I have seen it happen. 

Living on ramen/rice and beans/quinoa/oatmeal etc. not only will ruin your health, but will waste your limited resources. (I like those things but you can't live off a starvation diet.)

Most fine dining came from necessity and having limited ingredients around to use. Almost all of which are dirt cheap. The recipes are simple.

Start with learning the 'mother' sauces. Make soups and stews. A favorite dish of mine is rice, some meat, and a can of veg. Toss some soy sauce and some hosin sauce in there.

You can almost throw any ingredients together and make good food. (I have definitely f'd that up a couple times, but it's rare.)

Keep your food out of direct sunlight. It will last longer.

Any recipe that has a ton of ingredients is somebody trying to stroke their own ego, or doesn't know what they're doing. Find a simpler recipe. I've packed nice restaurants on ~6 ingredient dishes. Basic cheap ingredients.

Back in the day we used to feed groups of 30 or more on what we found in dumpsters over a fire. Everybody ate until they were stuffed and we had a real good time.

I just completely restocked, my EBT reups on the 9th (6 days from now) and I've got $60 left on my card. I pretty much eat what I want, but I lean towards healthier stuff. This is completely doable. 

I'm happy to teach, give out tips and tricks, answer questions, give recipes, etc. I'm homeless with an Obama phone and may have to go to shore to get to some wifi to answer so be patient.

I’m a 33F in the Waterloo/Kitchener/Cambridge area, and I’ve been toying with the idea of starting a book club for women in their late twenties to mid-thirties. My ***idealized*** *vision* for this group is ambitious, but I think it could be a lovely way to connect with like-minded women and build a little community around books.

Here’s the dream:

* A mix of genres: fiction, non-fiction, literary, maybe even a fun throwback or two.
* Monthly meet-ups in cozy coffee shops, parks, or someone’s home.
* A low-pressure environment: life is busy, and it’s okay if you don’t finish the book every time.
* Bonus: occasional snacks and wine nights? 🍷📚

I know this sounds like a lot, but that’s the end goal I have in mind. For now, I’m just looking to connect with other women who love reading and are interested in meeting up.

If there’s already a group like this in the area, I’d love to hear about it and possibly join! If not, I’d love to start something with others who are interested. If this resonates with you, drop a comment or DM me, and we can figure out a first meet-up to brainstorm and get things rolling.

3. Makes me feel terrible the next morning, GFUEL does not - heck sometimes I wake up more refreshed the next morning

So GFUEL really gets rid of all the annoying things that I had to deal with when it came to coffee. However, I’ve noticed there are some other side effects specific to GFUEL that I’ve not experienced with coffee, and was wondering if anyone else experienced these:
1. This is the most common one - I find myself out of breath - no idea why - but after drinking GFUEL I find myself needing to take deep breaths constantly - like there’s not enough air in my lungs for whatever reason. Note: I am an athlete who plays football (soccer) at a semi professional level - so have no breathing issues.
2. This only happens sometimes, but I get heart palpitations - but I guess this is normal probably cause of the Taurine (?) chemical - I heard energy drinks affect the heart that way - it can be painful but luckily this rarely happens
3. This one is weird, I am lactose intolerant and so used to always drink my coffee with lactose free milk, but of course I only drink GFUEL with water - but for some reason I often find myself getting gaseous after drinking GFUEL - not always but happens often
4. This last one is not really a side effect but wanted to mention anyway - I’m finding the impact of GFUEL on my focus and energy decreasing over time and realized I need to add more powder for the same amount of water to get the desired effects and I’m worried this will keep increasing. I suppose it’s normal given that your body becomes more numb to the formula (there’s a scientific term to describe this, but can’t remember). But I’m at the stage of taking two scoops per cup and sometimes adding another half scoop if I really want a kicker.

Wondering if anyone had any similiar experiences 🤔",1,1733312663.0,u_TheCrownOfKings,0,1.0,False

My Dad is in a wheelchair and his mind is gone. My siblings never have my back. All they do is bring drama into my life.

1h6dx6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1h6dx6d/cookingfood_tips_from_a_homeless_chef/,Cooking/Food Tips From a Homeless Chef,"My brief background:
Been homeless, rubber tramped, a vagabond, and housed up sometimes for 30 years. I got a boat given to me a little over a year ago. I paid $17.75 to register it and transfer the title.

A couple caveats:This is for those than have a way to cook. Stove, camp fire, BBQ, etc. I know some people's situations keep them from doing this. Cooking really isn't as complicated as some make it seem.

Unfortunately if you don't have a way to cook you're gonna blow through you EBT pretty quick. It sucks, but that's the way it is. Find food banks, go to as many feeds a day as you can, get food stamps/EBT, panhandle, busk, ask people for food, fly a sign, etc. If the feeds suck go somewhere else. You're already homeless. You can go anywhere. People will generally hook you up if you hitchhike out of there with nothing.

Here's some tips for eating healthy while living on EBT/food stamps:

I live on a boat now, so I guess not 100% homeless. I don't have refrigeration at the moment. Also it's just me. 

My go to lately is canned soup/chilli, tortillas, cheese, and having some munchies and sugary stuff. I mostly drink water, have for years. I do throw some other drinks in sparingly, because you have to have some flavor. Seems to make a pretty balanced meal. It's dirt cheap per meal. ~$3. If I made soup it would be less then half the cost.

I also buy some lunch meat, spam, and hot dogs. Definitely not the best health-wise but gives a decent bit of meat protein. If I'm craving red meat I'll grab some ground beef, bacon and an onion. Voila, bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Condiments from the grocery store deli. (I buy ketchup and mustard. Mayo packets as needed.)

I'll toss in a Cuban from Publix here and there. Some cliff bars. 

I have coffee, cream, and sugar every morning. 

I own a small sauce pan/pot, a normal sized skillet (14""?), enough dishes for two people, and some cheap utensils. So cleaning isn't too bad.

I cook on a double burner camp stove. I only use one burner ever. I have a BBQ sized propane tank (20lb.?), but for cooking the green 1lb. tanks last me about 2 weeks. (~5 months for the big tanks)

I've been an executive chef a few times in different resorts. You can do fine dining from scratch cheaper than making cheap unhealthy food, if you have a way to cook and a place to store food. Maybe not lobster and Ribeyes, but I have seen it happen. 

Living on ramen/rice and beans/quinoa/oatmeal etc. not only will ruin your health, but will waste your limited resources. (I like those things but you can't live off a starvation diet.)

Most fine dining came from necessity and having limited ingredients around to use. Almost all of which are dirt cheap. The recipes are simple.

Start with learning the 'mother' sauces. Make soups and stews. A favorite dish of mine is rice, some meat, and a can of veg. Toss some soy sauce and some hosin sauce in there.

You can almost throw any ingredients together and make good food. (I have definitely f'd that up a couple times, but it's rare.)

Keep your food out of direct sunlight. It will last longer.

Any recipe that has a ton of ingredients is somebody trying to stroke their own ego, or doesn't know what they're doing. Find a simpler recipe. I've packed nice restaurants on ~6 ingredient dishes. Basic cheap ingredients.

Back in the day we used to feed groups of 30 or more on what we found in dumpsters over a fire. Everybody ate until they were stuffed and we had a real good time.

I just completely restocked, my EBT reups on the 9th (6 days from now) and I've got $60 left on my card. I pretty much eat what I want, but I lean towards healthier stuff. This is completely doable. 

I'm happy to teach, give out tips and tricks, answer questions, give recipes, etc. I'm homeless with an Obama phone and may have to go to shore to get to some wifi to answer so be patient.

 I said maybe she should use the day to try out a new hobby. She said she didn't know what to start so I mentioned the multiple things she's said look interesting. She said on and repeated that she wanted us to do something. 

I told her that she can't just use me as an accessory whenever she's free and that she needs a hobby and needs to get comfortable doing things on her own because I'm not just here for her entertainment. 

I told her to respect my plans and start looking at something she could do on her own. She said I was being harsh towards her but I just said that it's not fair to expect me to give up whatever I have planned because she's incapable of being on her own.

pls sit tight, pray to a new religion,

dropping hot quips from an overflowing quill,

spitting acid rain, her disses hit like hurricanes,

house flipping bitches - with tornados of pain,

i hide a dull knife, inside a pine sidedrawer,
fight me, if youd like to die,

dont stand behind, remind me,  
to call time when night falls like a bright disco ball reflecting its light on a nice mirrored wall,
its a miracle, we survived, at all 


whilst your cunty fiancee, keeps digging your grave..

this is high stakes, play as diamond or spades,  

either way.your life-mate may be a bit pissed. 

cos youre drunk, and home late.
theres no fuckin way, to explain, so u wait,

to pay for a motorcade -you wont escape
i may be overpaying but they know my name

i chose consistency..they gave me novacain 

please tend to your wife and kids needs

or she might end it, via knife in the kidney 

look I'm just saying..
today's lecture was forcefed to you 

by a professor of autistic elocution,
and verbal executions, 


so pay attention to the lesson, 

unless ya too stupid,

have you been eating gluestix?

dont mean to be intrusive, 

had to elocute it - guess youre too dense 

the best is here to test the students 

with a torrent of expressive aggression,
and prudence..

are ye ready kids? ..aye aye capn!
ok lets do this!

mixing melanins, with sedatives, time to get strapped in

thats why i gotta boot ‘em, 
im abusing the stratagem

graaah! im a fucking myrmidon, 
the most unlucky larrakin

conscripted to the troops of doom,  
stuck here, im panicking, tell me how to turn it on
i only root brutes, no arena recruits
set loose, to find loot, fuck i really hate this dude

you wouldnt reach day two, 
wearing these wooden shoes..  

knock on pine boots,  as i loot a roman tomb,
salute to the guys fighting for the only womb, 
kinda feels like..this ludus might be doomed..
i hold high hopes of finding a tight rope,
to loop into a nice noose, ill use it on the ride home


stop me if you heard this version, 

its a funeral dirge

attuned to the earth, 

a neutered verse, in the form of a warsong, 

he forged on, but stopped too soon
a bored domme is here, snoring 
like a chainsaw, its painful, to the ear
wait til champagne pours, then take all their beer


don't worry, dude ill be dropping lore soon 
sorta in a hurry,  to brew coffee before noon

as i duel wield, 

my lyrical weapons, 

to draw teary confessions,

from priests in brown hessian

don't fear the howling beast,

fear the priesthood, around kids

don't press me, please, ill meet the next meat inspector, when ive got the energy

for a quick dissection or vivisection,
u got a vintage erection,
the shrinkage feels right, 
for my dick pic collection,

fuckin dumb pigs, found em on linked-in, 
by their snouts and pink skin, 

eating from the skip, at a delicatessen,

the mortuary afforded me a blessing

but they really oughta rate each kill,

which blade of steel, made you feel?


sellouts repeat, old mistakes, self-reveal,

help the children, for real, 1 pound per deal, 

from the dealer, down the hill 

hes awful tight , but he likes kill bill, 
cos he likes to sword fight, 
is he, really for real?
might stay up all night - to see if he spills
so why do i smell like fresh oiled steel?

i must be royalty, if the loyalists kneel,

im such a nuisance..

youre in love with a mutant,


a plucky young werewolf with plump lupus lips

a red rocket nudist, on the devils to-do list

so raise a silver spoon to the head of all gooners,

whom rumorists claim, 

still shills for krill, like hes a big kahuna

on tattooine,  he rides with bib fortuna..

its all love, feels and drug deals, 
NO ITS NOT A TUMOR
some of these kids must be on pills
that was just a rumor… cos shit got unreal,  


how does the son feel, 

now the real moms revealed?

remove the tumor, use humor to shield

i saw your future, its war and sutured seals

caught by abusers, to fight for a ludus,

or do dictating, 

i call that dick-taking,

a 101 for your mom..


who was undressing, 

before you even started stressing, 

bout getting none of none

all in good fun, an english lesson to some 

im a smith n weston, you jumped the gun, 
..u cunt..

just don't become the greasiest creep in the club 

no one loves a trust fund baby, 

no lump sum payment will sway me, 


don't come at me comparing wages, 

I guarentee you leave frustrated 

outflanked in melee, by a guy in a bubble,
who lives like a lady, shes hot property 

so stop yapping at me over money or economy

i want big boy energy - not bit coins or NFTs

ditch the two bit double breasted suit

i dont cum from cufflinks with attitude 

or cumberbuns, on arrogant dudes, 


self awareness is a healthier pursuit  

your incompetence gave me a confidence boost,

maybe im wrong, were you falsely accused?

you played that song on loop, for so long, 
it got long in the tooth, 
long before you got the boot

not an excuse, a review - of obvious truths..

you can always choose to not be a goose, 

wait til the lady says shes down to fuck too!

don't fuck around, in the town of timbuktoo


use whatever it takes to get lucky, for fucks sake

besides cable restraints or ducttape, thats just rape…

big girls don't play pattycake,

I don't give a fuck what money, daddy makes,

im into fatty cakes but

i shed deadweight like dropped pudding, 
if that's what it takes..

to ween you off baby food, 

swap baby blues for hot babes with boobs

it's time you grew up, kid,
go jump in a mosh pit, 
maybe you won't come across, 
quite so ..off-putting

1h6dsl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h6dsl6/how_to_escalate_things_slightly_with_a/,How to escalate things slightly with a (long-distance) friend via text?,"I (25M) have a friend (30F) who I've known for a few years and gotten a couple coffees with, strictly as friends - I obviously noticed she was attractive and a kind person, but there were never any thoughts beside friendship in my mind. Partially because we lived somewhat far away from each other, we never really got close enough to talk about personal things, but we started texting more after I left her country several months ago, mainly for me (at the time) because I wanted to continue practicing her language with a native speaker.

Since then I've gotten to know a bit more about her and both of us have opened up some more. I learned that there's far more about her than I knew before, and she is very much my type in an emotional and intellectual sense (I'm demisexual so that's quite important for me.) After getting out of a bad situation in her home country, I've become a lot more confident and more in shape than when we last met in person, and the vibe between us when we've texted has been quite playful, maybe even slightly flirty. I know she is currently single, likes my personality and sense of humor, and has dated other people of my ethnicity before (which is unusual in that country).

I've already lightly complimented her personality - is there a way to potentially escalate things a bit in the meantime without coming on too strongly? She's going to be away for a while, but I'll probably ask her if she would like to at least voice call (if not video call) next month when she's back, and I'll almost certainly be visiting her country for professional reasons later in the spring.

(By the way, I would 100% be alright if she didn't feel the same way and we simply stayed as friends. Knowing her personality and how long we've known each other, I believe she would likely be comfortable with that as well.)",3,1733311416.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Today I am no longer obese but overweight! Having started this journey at an almost morbidly obese BMI of 39, today it is 29 🤩

I've lost over 4st in the past 6 months. I've gone from a size 20 (but really a 22 in denial) to a size 16.

My confidence has skyrocketed. 
My m*ntal health has improved. 
I can walk up stairs and small hills without feeling like I'm having a heartattack. 

I have been promoted at work (thanks to increased energy, lack of brain fog, and generally not being the invisible fat girl anymore.)

I started dating again and met the most amazing man. My newfound confidence has meant that I've kept healthy boundaries with him and our relationship and I'm also not afraid or ashamed of showing my body off in front of him. Loose skin, soft belly, and all! 

I looove going clothes shopping! 😂 I appreciate and celebrate my body far more than I ever have done in the past, even in much slimmer years. 

I have a markedly improved relationship with food. There are foods to eat (and fuel your body with) and foods to taste (that feed your soul). I love cooking food that is full of flavour rather than calories. I have fully embraced that I've never really had a sweet tooth, I just used to punish myself with sweet treats or eat them out of social pressure. I am now comfortable letting people think whatever they want to think after I choose (and enjoy!) the coffee and after dinner mint rather than (suffering) the chocolate cake during meals out. 

This hasn't been an easy journey but my goodness am I grateful for taking the leap 6 months ago!

Ultimate combination if you ask me ;)currently im watching a Dutch show called lang leve de liefde .I’m no incredibly great at anything nor am I special in anyway I like things that most humans like , going on walks , baking, reading , watching YouTube about random topics that will never come up in daily conversation. I make a new playlist for every new vibe, mood, feeling or memory I have . I’m addicted to nicotine but also really embarrassed about it . And that’s all the oversharing I’m willing to do right now 

Looking for :
-a long term friend to text daily 

-someone that doesn’t make me do all the work in conversation even though I can yap a lot sometimes

-someone that doesn’t just have 1 playlist of all their liked songs ( lol ) 


Does that sound good ? If yes text me;) if no text me anyways ;))

The party is next Friday. I was invited a month ago, and let me tell you, it's a huge party, with live music and everything. I agreed, because the last team building we had was fun. But a few days ago, I was informed that half of my office hates me, or simply dislikes me (one of my good coworker showed me their whatsapp conversations about me, but they themselves didn't engage). I'm an introvert and also suffer from social anxiety, and I don't really socialise with others if not needed, and I think that might be a part of the problem. I have my own office and I'm usually quiet. When invited to have a lunch with others, I always agree, because I want to be polite and I feel like that's important in order to keep the relationships healthy. But knowing what some particular coworkers say about me just made me mad, and also very sad. I always smile at everyone, I always try to be helpful. When I first got here, I got sligtly bullied, too. It was my first day in the office and I wanted to ask if I can make myself a coffee. Two of my coworkes told me that I'm basically dumb and that they won't do MY job (excuse me, I wanted to know if I can have a coffee, but whatever). Since then some of them don't even say hi to me or if I knock on their doors to ask for an advice, they always tell me they're busy and they won't help me doing my job. They're passive agressive all the time, even when the thing I ask for is something trivial, like papers for printer which one of them keeps in their own office. I like my job, but I really don't like the enviroment. I'm thinking about leaving for the past two months, but the money keep me here.

There was a small coffee shop where the owner seemed to play Agatha Christie's Poirot all day on a wall-mounted TV. It wasn't like an interwar-themed cafe either, it was pretty much a normal cozy cafe except for this one quirk.

Anyway, it was close to where I lived so I'd usually go after work just to sit around, and eventually I just started chatting up the barista. I used to do counter work, so I knew how boring it could be and figured she'd appreciate the conversation.

Eventually I pointed out Poirot and asked her if she liked it. She said at first she didn't, but that seeing it every day was making her suddenly very interested in what was happening between the world wars. She was reading a book about Weimar Germany and showed me her doodling book full of art deco drawings.

I made a crack about whether a David Suchet mustache would fit me, and she said I had a little bit of Poirot, but had more of Hastings' energy.

I spent the better part of a year going to that cafe once or twice a week and chatting her up when she was on shift. We'd talk about the episode of Poirot and more about the things around him. Like the steam train he was riding, or the style of house where the episode's murder had taken place.

I asked her what her dream was and she said she wanted to live in a small town in Ireland, where she could bike everywhere and keep a small inn, but she didn't know what style of architecture she wanted. I told her one of my dreams was to do a grand tour of Europe, and that if she had her inn up and running by then, I'd be happy to be a patron.

I have TA absences on most days. 

I'm going crazy trying to establish a schedule for the students, manage behaviors and work with the paraprofessionals. While they all seem very nice, life seems to get in the way. Every week, there are several absences. 

Also, I hate to micromanage but I look up and something bad is happening. Someone is eating a nonfood item. Someone is eating other people's lunch. Someone pooped  in a trash can. Someone dumped all the hand sanitizer in the trash. I yell something out, and then other teachers tell me the staff was complaining about my tone.

I find half-drunk coffee and open yogurt containers tucked around the room after dismissal.

1h6djgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1h6djgc/trip_report_zhangjiajie_national_park_and_around/,Trip report - Zhangjiajie national park and around,"Hello all,

I have used extensively information from this sub and other ones to plan my trips in China and thought I could share my experience with ZJJ as this is the place we had the most trouble planning.

For the context, I travel with my boyfriend and we are on a year long trip across Asia so no planning beforehand but also no constraints. This is our second time in China on 15 days visa free, so we were familiar with all the Chinese ecosystem.
We love to hike but I have some issues that are limiting the uphill I can do so we manage around that.

We initially planned 3 days in total in ZJJ area and ended up spending 5 days as we loved the place. We were there from Thursday to next Monday and it was last week so end of November - beginning of December.

Day 1 : on a Thursday morning, we arrived from Shanghai with night train around 9am, and hopped on a bus to Wulingyuan. Follow directions for bus station and show the staff near ticket machines the name of the town, he will direct you : go through bag check and buy your ticket just near the platforms, Alipay/WeChat accepted, 13RMB per person. Ride took around 30minutes. We went to our booked hotel -N°1 inn the corner (or scenery inn) that was just 3minutes away from bus stop, hoping to drop our bags. Reality was way better : we were welcomed with coffee, room was not ready (mind you, it was 10am so obviously!) but they gave us another so we could settle. And owner speaks English (the woman) so she sat us down and asked about our plans and proceeded to give us lots of explanations and suggestions for park itinerary based on how long we had and stuff. She used a map with English and mandarin, so we kept this info with us all the time and it allowed us to show staff/bus drivers where we wanted to go so they could help us finding our way. She also helped us book tickets at a discounted rate. We chose the all rides included tickets that we paid 488RMB per person and that was the best choice we made. If you come between December and February, there's a discount (entrance goes from 225 to 165).
We then got ready and left for the park around 11. Entrance was quiet, got an issue with my ticket because of an error in passport number but she helped us through WeChat to solve this with the ticket office. We made our way to Tianzi mountain cablecar and then went on to see sights up there starting with Arranging Battle Platform and Shentang Gulf. Nobody, stunning views, quiet... Then we went on to He Long's park, the main area up Tianzi. We ate there, lots of options, around 20RMB per person for different snacks. We proceeded with main sights around 2pm and while some were super crowded, you could get same view but way less people by walking 50meter further most of the time. We then walked down the mountain along tons of stairs (host said 6000 stairs, we think it's less but it's still 900m descent). We were mostly alone, stunning views again. We ended the day with Ten mile gallery. Monorail seem like a scam, it's a short walk and it's funnier to see them pass by as animals than to be on it seems. We were then exhausted and waited 10min for a bus to get to the entrance and got home. Day count : 275m ascent, 880m descent, 17.5km total

Day 2 : well rested we got up at 6am to be at the entrance for opening time. We were there at 7:10, doors opened at 7:20 and we got on the first bus with mostly workers to Bailong elevator. No queue of course, got up and went to the most famous avatar mountain with like 5 people and us. It was just amazing, nobody around and so quiet and the light from the morning was fantastic. We first saw other people around 9 or 9:30am so a long time alone up there to soak in the views. This area name is Yuanjianjie. We then took a bus to Yangjiajie, lesser known and more recently opened section up the mountain. There, we went on a hike that led us to my favourite point of view, the one step to the heaven You got to climb a ladder up there but man, what a view ! We went on to corridor on the cliff and got back up afterward. We were exhaustedw got a snack from a very very crowded Yuanjiajie main spot and then got back home for a nap, through Bailong elevator again. No queues anywhere. OnThat's where we decided to extend our stay for two more nights ! It was like 2pm, we were super tired and wanted to see more. Day count : 430m ascent, 350m descent. 17km walk

Day 3 : that was our rest day after two intense days.  We slept late and only got out to get some food and to the park to see the sunset at the spot our host advised. As it was Saturday and great weather we thought it would be extra crowded but no ! Seems tour group don't go for that late. The spot is up Tianzi mountain, near He Long park and is called Yubi peaks. Sunset was stunning ! We got down after and soon back to the room to rest.
8.5km walk

Day 4 : last day of ticket validity and last day in the park. Early start again but we had to take a bus to South entrance. We took the first one at 7:30am and got there around 8:15 (bus did not leave at said time). Cost is 10RMB per person, WeChat or cash. We entered there and took the cable car up to HuangShi village. We did the walk round the top, from east to west and it was quiet. Views are again amazing ! We got a snack down the cable car and went to walk on the golden whip stream. The walk is nice and it is cool to see peaks from down perspective after being up. It's easier on the legs also ! Beginning was crowded but way quieter afterwards. We took the park bus at the end to get back to Wulingyuan entrance and went for a nap. Great conclusion.
Day count : 210m ascent, 300m descent. 17.6km walk.

Day 5 :  after all this, we were so happy and tired but still decided to go to Tianmen mountain. As we loved our hotel in Wulingyuan, we stayed there one more night and got an early bus to Zhangjiajie city the next morning, a Monday. We arrived at the mountain at 8:30, bought tickets with no queue and chose line B (all lines available). Price is 275 per person. Dropped the bags at luggage depository (5rmb per bag) and went on the minibus to the first cable car. We were 10 on this one where capacity is around 30, no queues again. We walked the path and got up the 999 stairs to heaven, which were surprisingly easy. Escalator option available for 32 yuan per person one way. Weather was a bit cloudy but still great visibility ! We then took escalators up the mountain and circled the top on the west line then east line. Climbed Yu Hu peak, went on the cliffside path but no glass bridge, didn't got to the top top tho (separate sightseeing cable car for 32 yuan). We then took the big cablecar down for the 30min ride to downtown. No queues and our own cabin, amazing ! 
Very tired after this, we got noodles near the abandoned hmart and got on a bus for the station to go to Fenghuang. 50min later, we took the bus for 7rmb per person (no common transportation bus, this is a private service - there is also maglev train for 30yuan) that dropped us to ancient town. We settled in our hotel and went for a stroll at night. It was amazing and quite empty but weather was great, not so cold. Quite a change in scenery but a good endpoint to this amazing trip !
Day count : 600m ascent, 160m descent 8km walk up the mountain, 18.1 total in the day.

I hope I have been clear enough but please ask if you have any question ! I know it's a long read but these details are what we had trouble finding so I hope it will help others. We loved it and while it's expensive, the 4 day ticket makes a lot of sense and we'd recommend enjoying it to the fullest. As our host said tho, we have been really lucky on the weather as we had fantastic weather all along, sunny and not so cold. It was around 3-6 degrees in the morning but quickly got up with the sun to 15-20 in the afternoon, so really nice. 
Moneywise, each way in a cablecar or elevator costs around 70 yuan. We did 7 rides, so that itself is the price we paid our ticket : Chinese laziness also offer to everybody the possibility of enjoying these views and infrastructure is quite discreet from afar.

Enjoy your travels !

1h6dgbv,https://i.redd.it/6qspxovmct4e1.jpeg,Behind the screen: The Dark Reality of Becoming a Virtual Assistant,"The idea of being a virtual assistant is often romanticized. Work from home, set your hours, be your own boss—it sounds like a dream, right? But behind the glossy social media posts and success stories lies a reality that few talk about. Transitioning into this field isn’t just challenging—it can feel like walking on a tightrope, and the fall can be steep.

# The Illusion of Stability

Unlike traditional jobs, where a contract often guarantees some sense of security, being a virtual assistant is a constant game of proving your worth. The company you work for could go bankrupt without warning, leaving you scrambling for new clients. Worse, your relationship with a boss can change in the blink of an eye. One wrong move, one perceived misstep, and you’re back to square one.

It’s a stark reminder: in this line of work, stability is a privilege, not a guarantee.

# The Job Hunt Rollercoaster

Searching for clients can be soul-crushing. You send out dozens of applications, tweak your proposals, and showcase your skills, only to be met with silence or rejection. It’s not just about finding work—it’s about finding the *right* work, with people who value you and pay fairly. And let’s face it, that’s easier said than done.

Even when you land a gig, the uncertainty doesn’t end. Contracts can be short-term, or worse, abruptly terminated. The fear of losing a client or not being able to find new ones is a constant shadow.

# The Emotional Cost

The instability takes a toll on your mental health. You’re not just worried about where your next paycheck is coming from—you’re also grappling with self-doubt. *Am I good enough? Am I doing enough?* The pressure to always be “on,” always be available, and always exceed expectations can be exhausting.

# The Bright Side: Advantages of Being a Virtual Assistant

While the challenges are real, it’s not all doom and gloom. For those who prepare and persevere, being a virtual assistant can be incredibly rewarding:

* **Flexibility**: You can set your hours and create a work-life balance that suits your lifestyle.
* **Diverse Opportunities**: Working with different clients and industries broadens your skills and keeps work interesting.
* **Geographic Freedom**: As long as you have internet access, you can work from anywhere—your home, a coffee shop, or even a beach.
* **Potential for Growth**: Many virtual assistants build long-term relationships with clients, leading to more opportunities, higher pay, or even transitioning into specialized roles.
* **Independence**: You’re in control of your career path, workload, and how much you want to take on.

# The Need for a Safety Net

Before diving into this career, one thing is crucial: don’t resign from your current job without a financial safety net. Being a virtual assistant is far from stable, and the risk of sudden income loss is high. Companies can go under, or a boss who once seemed supportive might decide to let you go.

Build an emergency fund, test the waters with part-time virtual work, and have a backup plan before taking the plunge. Jumping without preparation is a gamble that could cost more than you’re ready to lose.

# Is It Worth It?

For many, the answer is still yes. The freedom to work from anywhere, to pursue a passion, and to build something of your own can outweigh the negatives. But let’s be clear: it’s not an easy path. It’s one filled with highs and lows, victories and setbacks.

If you’re considering becoming a virtual assistant, don’t just focus on the perks. Be prepared for the hustle, the uncertainty, and the emotional weight that comes with it.

1h6df6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1h6df6l/mirrored_worlds/,Mirrored worlds,"You wake up in your bed, looking into the mirror across the room, you see yourself, you smile, you stand up and go to the bathroom to brush your teeth, you decide to not put makeup today, you look fine without it, it's not like your features any less feminine because of this. 


You put on your sweater and a jacket on, you open the door of your apartment and take your daily stroll to work. 


You meet a lady, your mothers friend you didn't see for so long, she stops you and starts talking about time she remembers when you were just a little girl, it brings you some memories of your childhood, playing with your friends and with dolls.


You go through the street, scrolling through twitter, it's all just drama, some anti-woke account posting ugly men wearing dresses, that's what all trans people look like, it's not like you've ever seen someone differentiating from this and you have trusty posts on social media to prove it. 


Why do these people need that change anyway, why do they dress like clowns? You are a woman for all of your life and you wouldn't change that, why they can't just accept this?


You're at work, it's a normal day, just as always your coworkers compliment you on your looks, you take coffee breaks in a company of women, chit-chatting about your lives.


You get a notification on your phone. It's your girlfriend! She always knows the time when you get off work. Seems like she wants to meet up with you again today, you feel like you can't wait to move in together, she was wonderful through and through. 


You go to meet her, it's your average date, all you feel is butterflies in your stomach when talking to her, she's wonderful, isn't she? She talks you into staying over and you just couldn't refuse offer like that, after some hugs and kisses she starts touching you, you feel a shiver all across your body. 


She tells you how much she loves you, all of you, she's glad she found a lover like you, she's glad to be a lesbian, she dated men, but they were just disgusting to her, with their bodies and genitals and characters, you're the opposite of that, someone to adore fully. You fall asleep in her arms, you feel happy and fulfilled.


#######


You wake up, looking at your phone, you already missed your work hours, there's no point in going, not like you even wanted to go. You spent 3 hours doom scrolling and whining last night, you can't do anything useful for your life. 


You find strength to sit up, all you feel is fatigue and your head spinning, you look into the mirror in disgust. Why did you put a mirror across the room? Are you stupid? You know the mere sight of your body makes you feel like dying, why did you do that? 


You spend next two hours in the bed, staring into nothingness or just scrolling through socials. You feel hungry, a call for you to get out of the bed, you go to the bathroom and brush your teeth, putting moisturizing cream on your face, like if it changes anything about it.


You go to the kitchen and make yourself a sandwich and put a kettle on. You sit down in front of it, waiting for the water to boil. You look aside keeping your eyes on the microwave with your reflection looking back at you. 


Your shoulders are so wide in the reflection, why are they so wide? Out of misery and anger you punch your shoulders, like they'll magically get narrow because of that, you feel pain, you hug yourself. You're so gross, why would anyone love someone like that?


Thoughts start piercing through your mind: will I ever be loved? will I ever love myself? why couldn't I be normal? am I deluded? why the voice in my head is a man? I never had childhood I wish I had, did I even have one? I was just a loser kid who never fit with anyone. I don't remember anything.
Nobody will love me. Men? They'd never choose me over them. Women? Why am I even thinking about that, am I just invading their spaces, am I just a pervert? 


Why? why? why? why I couldn't be like them, why I couldn't just be normal, why I couldn't be cisgender? I feel so gross. You imagine yourself going out dressed feminine, all you think about is how you'll get beaten up or murdered or ridiculed. 


It's not like you even got a chance, out of all places in the world you are a tranny living in eastern europe. And your father, your father every child he had after he left you is a boy, is it some sort of a sick gene thing, could you even be born a girl? Your mother told you could have a sister, but she died at birth, you could never be a girl.

1h6dde8,https://i.redd.it/yjflh2xmbt4e1.jpeg,"Newbie review of purchases (Polaris, Opus, Switch) and 4:6 drawdown problem and questions ","So my wife thinks I've gone through a 1/3 of life crisis as I've suddenly decided to get properly into pour over (previously using Melitta Epour - which is fine BTW). Black Friday was my excuse to get a kit that was reasonably priced. Things I got and initial thoughts on them:

1) Hario Polaris scale (£60)- really like this as you can set a ratio and when pouring it gives a % for how far through the pour you are. I find that really intuitive as I'm working on the 4:6 V60 method atm. This is why I chose this over the Fellow Tally. 

2) Fellow Opus (£125)- I know it's not loved here but it seems like a good starting point for the price (and look) and I wasn't up for spending £100-£200 extra on DF54/Ode2/DF64.

3) Hario switch 03 (£39) - like that I can do a normal V60 brew or immersion brew. Working on a traditional v60 brew for now. 

4) stagg pourover kettle (£55) - got this as I love the look and I have a boiling water tap. It actually works on my induction hob which was surprise so I can ensure water is roughly the right temp when starting. 

Problem
I have been trying the Tetsu 4:6 pour over method (20% at 45s intervals) using 20g at 1:15 ratio (300ml). I can never get the cup to fully draw down by 3:30-3:45. I've ground from 7 all the way up to 10 on my Opus and in that time I'm getting to 200- 230ml of coffee brewed. It draws down quick in first 2 pours and then slow in remaining pours. 

Questions
Do I keep going coarser? I'm unsure as according to the Fellow guide I'm getting into the cafetiere grind size range. 

Is my problem pour height/style? I pour from around the top edge of the Switch in a swirl motion. 

Is the 03 size plus it being a Switch a factor in my drawdown speed too? I know most people talk about using the standard size 02 v60 for this method. 

Any help would be appreciated. ",2,1733309697.0,pourover,4,1.0,False
1h6dcor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ListenToGrow/comments/1h6dcor/what_makes_a_person_less_productive/,What makes a person less productive?,"Hey everyone! I've been thinking a lot about productivity lately, especially after noticing how much time I waste scrolling through social media and procrastinating on important tasks. I wanted to share some insights I've gathered from my personal experience and research about what really kills our productivity.

First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room - our phones. I used to think I was good at multitasking, but man, was I wrong. Every notification, every quick ""just checking"" moment breaks our focus completely. Studies show it takes about 23 minutes to get back into deep focus after an interruption. That's crazy when you think about it!

Poor sleep is another major productivity killer. I learned this the hard way when I tried to function on 5 hours of sleep for a week. Spoiler alert: it didn't go well. Our brains need proper rest to function effectively, and no amount of coffee can truly make up for it.

Speaking of habits, I recently started listening to ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear (I found it for free on Audible at https://athometouch.com/atomichabits), and it really opened my eyes about how our daily routines can either make or break our productivity. The book explains how tiny changes in our habits can lead to remarkable results.

Another huge productivity killer is not having a clear system for tasks. When everything feels important, nothing gets done. I used to keep all my to-dos in my head, and let me tell you, that was a recipe for disaster.

Perfectionism is also a sneaky one. We often don't start tasks because we're afraid they won't be perfect. This leads to procrastination, which then creates stress, and the cycle continues.

Environmental distractions play a bigger role than we think. A cluttered workspace, noisy surroundings, or even the wrong room temperature can significantly impact our focus and productivity.

Not taking breaks is counterintuitive but really harmful to productivity. Our brains aren't designed for marathon work sessions. Regular breaks actually help us maintain focus and energy throughout the day.

Poor nutrition is often overlooked. Skipping meals or eating junk food can leave us feeling sluggish and unable to concentrate. I've noticed a huge difference in my productivity when I eat well-balanced meals.

Finally, not having clear goals makes it impossible to be truly productive. Without direction, we end up busy but not productive - there's a big difference!

I'm actually working on improving all these areas, and it's been helpful to have guidance. The Atomic Habits audiobook I mentioned earlier has been super valuable in understanding how to build better habits and break bad ones. You can check it out for free with a 30-day trial on Audible.

Have let 350mls of water reach boiling point then added two tablespoons of Devagandhari (a rich aroma of slightly bitter dark chocolate with salty depth - similar to when we caramelize jaggery for payasam) 

I tasted two brews of this in my french press (which isn't the finest in the market) we could sense the tarty orange peel like citrus to the back of our tongues and the sweet aftertaste was profiling towards that of a jaggery experience. Wife dint get any jasmine, but I (very conscious efforts) got the hints of jasmine towards the very end of my coffee. 

Now to the tea type - love the honey shade, it put a wide smile on me, I got the jasmine in my fourth sip, is slightly bitter than the FP and is definitely better than the FP made. 

Will definitely get all the different grinds of Devagandhari and will brew them in one another method for which it is not meant to be, but will work because of the grind size.

160cm 53kg.

So as far as I know I have some sort of dysautonomia or POTS. My cardiologist thinks it could be that. My thyroid was checked, I have no issues with that. My symptoms seem to be getting worse and worse. I want to get to the root of what caused this because it’s terrifying.

some days is my pots isn’t as terrifyingly high but resting heart rate always seems to be high. So I’ve have all the tests done with my cardiologist. Echo seems to be normal. I’ve had a new abnormal ecgs with flat and inverted t waves. Which alarmed me.

My blood pressure at the last few doctors check ups have been around 135/90 - 138/90. My doctors didn’t seem to bring it up which I found odd. But I’m stressed about it now.

The last time my gp got 138/85 and then when I stood up it lowered to 110/80?

Is this something anyone deals with.

I’m changing my diet. Trying to exercise more. But when my pots flares I can’t ever exercise. It’s that bad. I don’t want to “decondition myself” but I have no choice and these doctors don’t seem to understand. When my resting heart rate is 100, then standing my 140, excising is near impossible.

I’m a big coffee drinker. And thankfully it doesn’t affect my heart rate, weirdly it lowers it everytime I drink a cup. I limit myself to 2 shots of espresso a day. But I’m going to cut it out completely along with sugar because I did notice my blood sugar was pretty high during an emergency room random blood sugar test. The time of the test I hadn’t eaten in 20 hours but I was extremely stressed. My blood sugar was 6.3 at that time. It shocked me. So I have a lot of stress at the moment on what’s wrong. I don’t know where to start. The doctors I have don’t seem to care to investigate more. It’s hard finding a doctor that cares. I seen at least a dozen.

I’m loving the coffee that I’m getting out of it, but I am running an issue that I can’t seem to solve

The extraction times seem to vary wildly between shots, especially for the first shot after the machine has been off. One time I’ll get 30 grams out in 35 seconds, the next I might get 50 grams in 25 seconds. Usually, the first shot of the day runs a lot quicker, in any case

The weird thing is that I’m not changing the grind settings or anything. I try to make my prep as consistent as possible. I always use a 18 gram dose in, sometimes maybe 17.9 if the grinder has a little retention. I do WDT with a dosing ring to avoid spillage and use a calibrated, self leveling tamper (Normcore 58.5 V4, 15lbs spring installed)

Is there any way I can avoid this? I’m theorizing that it’s because of the water temperature, but I am using the tips from the Whole Latte Love video on the E24: pre-warm the machine with portafilter attached for 10 minutes, run the machine for 5-7 seconds without portafilter, wait for the light to go off and back on again, and then start the extraction.

From healthcare to hospitality, traditional roles,, which are operational by nature (serving coffee, tea to caring for patient, delivering food, making homes) are going to get transformed by AI to deliver services personalized. The role of service Designer will be to bring empathy to these touch points and not let technology overwhelm the user!

My story: I am a longtime user of the most basic Breville Baristsa Express with grinder. 3 years of mostly positive experience with different coffees, preground (double-wall filter), or freshly ground. Cleaned and backflushed my machine multiple times over the course of the 3 years, even repaired issues around gasket. Because of voltage difference between the US and EU, I left my 4 (!) Breville appliances behind and bought 2 immediately upon arrival in EU. I fancied returning to my old lifestyle. Alas, I faced malfunction already on the 1st use. Let's NOT talk about coffee, but on backflushing. At the time pressure would normally go even beyond espresso range (beyond 12 o'clock), my machine starts buzzing, meter vibrates, and that's all. Breville's own videos exist on YT that show where the pressure should go. Anyhow, I have been unsuccessfully corresponding w/ Sage support for close to 2 months. They try to make me give up. They seem to have some kind of a playbook to ""deflect"" customers coming to them w/ problems. Even today, after I had mentioned backflushing demo, they go back to ""coffee talk"". 1) what are your experiences? 2) what can we do to escalate? 3) be warned, 4) don't waste time on fruitless exchanges w/ support!
