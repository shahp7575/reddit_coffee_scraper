1que180,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1que180/hm_humor_december_chills/,[HM] Humor :: December Chills,"December came in sideways—wind scraping the streets, frost biting through Kirk’s jacket like it knew him personally. He lived in a second-floor apartment that smelled faintly of old coffee and regret, the kind of place where the heater rattled louder than his thoughts. Kirk was twenty-eight and drifting. No job. No plan. Just days that slid into nights without leaving a mark.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, wedged into his mailbox like an accusation.

The handwriting was his father’s—sharp, deliberate, disappointed before it even spoke. Kirk didn’t open it right away. He stood in the stairwell, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, already knowing what it would say.

\*You need to get your life together.\*  
\*No job.\*  
\*Sleeping with loose women.\*  
\*December isn’t a time to waste.\*

His dad always wrote like the calendar itself was watching.

Kirk crumpled the letter halfway through, then smoothed it back out. Even torn, the words felt heavy. He went upstairs, sat on the edge of his bed, and stared at the wall where an old movie poster peeled at the corners. He wondered when exactly he’d become the version of himself everyone expected to fail.

That night, the cold felt louder.

He drove with the radio on low, letting static fill the space where his thoughts usually circled. Then, between weather warnings and a tired DJ voice, an ad cut through.

\*A new night club opens this Friday.\*  
\*One night. One door. Everything changes.\*  
\*Welcome to December Chills.\*

The voice was calm, almost intimate—like it was speaking directly to him. No address. No hype. Just a pulse of low bass under the words and a final line:

\*Lose yourself or find something real.\*

Kirk laughed at first. Life-changing night clubs were for people who believed in that kind of thing. But the name stuck. \*December Chills.\* It felt like the month talking back.

For the rest of the week, the ad followed him. Different DJs. Same words. Same bass. Same promise. By Friday, it didn’t feel like a coincidence anymore—it felt like an invitation.

The club was tucked between an abandoned theater and a closed-down bakery, its sign barely glowing against the snow. No line. No bouncer. Just a door humming with sound.

Inside, the air was warm and vibrating. Music rolled through the room like a heartbeat, slow and deep. People moved like they belonged to the night itself—not flashy, not lost, just \*present\*. For the first time in months, Kirk didn’t feel invisible.

At the bar, no one asked him what he did for work. No one cared who his father was or how badly he’d failed expectations. A woman smiled at him—not the careless kind his dad warned about, but something quieter. Something knowing.

As the night went on, Kirk felt pieces of himself thaw. He danced. He talked. He listened. Somewhere between songs, he realized the chill he’d been carrying wasn’t the cold—it was fear. Fear of becoming nothing. Fear of trying.

When he stepped back outside near dawn, snow falling softly, the city looked different. Still cold. Still broken in places. But alive.

The club was gone. Just the old building again, dark and silent.

In his pocket, Kirk felt something folded. Another letter—but this one wasn’t from his dad. No handwriting. Just a simple line printed clean and clear:

\*December doesn’t end you. It shows you who you are.\*

Kirk smiled, breath fogging the air. For the first time, winter didn’t feel like punishment.

It felt like a beginning.

I used my Vertuo Plus machine for \~ 5 years (2020-2025 ). But in spring 2025 the machine got broken. So I used the classic filter coffee again and I enjoyed it. So I didn't feel the urge to buy a new machine.  
However, I am currently considering purchasing one again, as I occasionally still want to drink Vertuo coffee. Especially as I still have a few packs (\~ 4-5) of Vertuo coffee left.

But which one? The Next is not an option for me, as I red only bad stuff about this one.  
So I need to decide between Pop (+) or a second-hand Vertuo Plus machine. I would get one for \~ 45 Euros. Unfortunately, Nespresso has discontinued the Vertuo Plus, so I can't buy a new one.

Whats your opinion in this case?

Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

I got it because it was cheap and I needed big rug for my new dog as she was sliding around like on ice. The many colors hide dirt even though some colors are light and this is huge win! Doggo loves the rug!! I think it’s OK. i like colors but to me it gives a modern vibe and I was going for eclectic and a little boho.  The size is not perfect for room but perfect for dog so it’s a keeper because she can run full zoomies with traction and she can roll around!  The rug works so great that it turns out I need MORE rugs because once my dogs zooms off of rug she can’t adjust to wood and yikes!  

The rugs will be close together or could possibly be layered.  The pictures attached are full on of rug in living room, the space in living room beside rug approx 2 1/2 ft with bare floor in front of door and TV leading to kitchen, bare floor looking into the kitchen from living room and shot of hallway.  I need a rug in kitchen area not necessarily going under table per tradition but covering enough floor for zoomies in bare open floor area.  Also, a runner in hallway and maybe a runner or layered rug in living room to cover that skinny bare area in front of door going toward kitchen. The rugs need to somehow look good together as it’s all open and I’m way out of my league!  I also have one thing I wish were different that I need your opinion about. If I could I would layer a smaller boho print or solid rug under coffee table to break things up but I can’t find any examples of a big colorful rug underneath another rug with the exception of welcome mats.  The examples I find are plain textures rugs on bottom with the exception of welcome mats.  Could under coffee table layering work?

Do you have any ideas for other rugs? Color, size, shape,any advice? 

Rugs would be:

Hefty enough not to slip and slide except possibly under coffee table a washable or light cloth won’t work.

Either has a lot colors and pattern or a dark color. Lots of dog fur and heavily trafficked area needs dirt camouflage.

Affordable

Coordinating with living room rug but lean less modern?  

Things I’m considering:

Not having rug under kitchen table?

Possibly layering rugs into kitchen? 

Layering rug under coffee table to break up modern color splotch look?

Keeping kitchen rug far enough away from cabinets and counters. 

Picking up the teal or dark pink dark plum

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qudupx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qudupx,2025 Patagonman Race Report,"Hi Everyone. It has been almost 2 months since I raced the Patagonman Extreme Triathlon in the Aysen region of Chilean Patagonia. I thought I would write a report about the race. Not so much about my own race as the major suggestion would be ""don't get sick before your race"" but with the draw for this year's race coming up, to give some info to others as to what to expect and hopefully answer some questions that I struggled to find answers to in my preparations. This will probably be pretty long but the tldr; It is an awesome race and experience and you should do it.

  
**What is Patagonman:** For those that do not know, it is a full distance, self supported, point to point race. The swim is 3.8km and begins with a jump off a ferry. The bike is about 175km with about 2500m of elevation gain on active roads through multiple different climates. The run is 44km and 800-1000m of elevation gain that begins and ends on pavement but the majority is on gravel roads or trails as you hop from valley to valley through some stunning scenery. You have 17 hours to complete it and you have to bring a support person to help you in transitions, to organise your gear and nutrition during the race, and to join you, if you/they want, over the last 14km of the run. The race does provide aid stations at the 90km mark of the bike, and this year at the 8, 10, 20, and 30km marks of the run.

  
**About me/choosing Patagonman:** I am in my late 30s. I started doing triathlon specific training about 2.5 years ago. I have a rare blood condition which made doing outdoor endurance events impossible for me until a new experimental medication started getting tested about 3 years ago and I suddenly could be outside all day with no issues. I decided I want to use as long as I am on the medication to do as many things I could not do before. I came across a video about the Norseman and decided I wanted to do an extreme triathlon. I entered the draw for it but did not get picked, but someone I knew mentioned Patagonman and I looked into it. It was the style of race I wanted to do and I have always had a fascination about Patagonia, so a reason to travel down there and see the area while also doing a race sounded perfect. So I applied and got picked. I had a week to decide if I wanted to do it and pay the entrance fee. I took that week to think it through, and ensure I had a friend who I trusted to join me on the trip. One of my friends jumped at the opportunity and so I paid my fee and was set. The next day I realised the logistical hurdle the race was going to be.

**Preparation:** In my first year of triathlon I joined an online training group (I work shift work and a physical group would be difficult to sync up with) and began learning about the different aspects of triathlon. My background is in power sports. I was a high level bobsleigh athlete previously, having represented two different countries on the world stage, and had spent 8 years training in the sport before retiring and coaching for a few years until COVID had my coaching contract ended and I decided to go back to school and get a job with a bit more stability. I had done swimming lessons as a kid and grew up around lakes and other bodies of water, so I was not afraid to jump in those. But I could tread water and do short swims, I had never done endurance swimming. Biking, I had grown up with a bike. I did mountain bike mainly, a little bit of bike commuting, but I had gotten my first real road bike shortly after I started my new treatments. I love bikes, and biking, and am decently fast, especially for my build. Running, I can do it at a very average pace, but always hated it. I spent years sprinting and the thought of going further than 100m sounded gross.

In that first year with the Norseman in mind, I competed in 2 sprint triathlons, ran a half marathon, and then did a 70.3. I also met up with my online group at another 70.3 and did the bike leg on a relay team. During this time I did not get picked for Norseman and then did get picked for Patagonman. When I got picked I was prepping to run my first marathon. I also decided I would sign up for a Gran Fondo and an extreme trail race as part of my preparation. Along with that I did 2x sprint races, and an Olympic triathlon. My thought process was that if I could do all the events separately with some gas in the tank then I could do the full race.

In the lead up to the marathon I started having frustrations with my training group. I was not getting my programs sent to me and details I felt were important were being forgotten. My coach also had not done an event like this before and that was making me a little wary as well. I was researching everything I could for this race and came across a program by TMR Coaching that had been followed by many and had been adapted based off feedback. It was also pretty cheap for a program. I was already on Training Peaks so I decided I would grab it, look it over, and see if it would work for me. Disclaimer: Having been a coach as a job, I did have a bunch of courses I had completed as part of that job and have a decent idea about periodization and building training plans and with the last year of seeing what worked for me in training, had an idea of a good plan for myself. This plan looked solid, was something I could integrate into my life and my work schedule, and so I left my online training group and started training alone.

My biggest worry was finishing the swim. I am not a fast swimmer. I can swim the same pace for forever, but I had been stuck around 2min/100m in the pool for a while. I had improved my form by doing some classes at the pool/gym I go to and was using way less energy to swim the same distances, but my speed was not improving. However, I did not care. I could swim fast enough to make the 2 hour swim cutoff and that is all I cared about.

The bike is where I am strong. I can go all day. Knocking out 160-200km on the bike after work is something I would do. I tried to do all my long rides outdoors until the weather changed. Doing my more focussed rides for tempo and the such I did on my trainer setup. I moved from Zwift to TrainingPeaks Virtual as it was included with TP and has always worked wonderfully for me. I watch TV when I am on the bike anyways so do not need the kudos and such in Zwift. For the hill session workouts I had I would load the GPX file into TP and ride that for however long the session was for. Those files were included with the training program I bought.

Running, I started to enjoy. As I had finished the marathon just before I started the training program for Patagonman, I had been doing a lot of running. I had started to enjoy the long runs. I would just zone out a bit and take in the scenery around me as I ran the river valleys I was using for most of my runs. I spent time doing hill runs as well. There are some steeps hills out fo the river valleys and I would run up and down those. I also went to an area on the side of another big hill by where I live and would do some running on the trails there. Getting out of town to the mountains was hard with my schedule but having access to trails in the city really helped me. I would also incorporate my running sessions into my commute to work. Adding detours and such to ensure I ran for long enough. 

Over the summer I did travel to Europe for a family wedding and brought my bike with me. I ended up doing some longer rides in Belgium, some crit racing in Holland, and tried to fit in some running when I could. I never really peaked for any of the other races I put in my schedule either. The Gran Fondo I finished 3rd at and just treated it like a long ride in my program, the sprints as more of a brick session, and the Olympic was a put in as a longer brick instead of my long ride that weekend. The trail race was supposed to be a long run but after my shoes tore my feet apart on the descents, I had to take a couple days to let them heal and found different trail shoes that I tested on downhills before the race and did not destroy my feet. I also did some cold open water swimming in the mountains in the fall, including a swim across the lake, a run up the lake, and then 18 holes of golf with my friends (one friend followed me in a canoe and took my wetsuit and gave me my running stuff before going back to where we started and then meeting me at the golf course with fresh clothes). The last 1.5 months of training before the race moved indoors as winter arrived and outside of some runs, everything else was done indoors.

**Logistics:** Flying to and from Balmaceda, Chile (airport for the region) - There is no direct flights from where I live to Chile. So I knew I would have to do connections. I also had a large amount of vacation time I needed to use so I decided to head south about 2.5 weeks before the race, and come back about a week after. Not wanting to connect through the US I decided instead to go through Mexico. On the way down to Chile I flew to Mexico City, then to Santiago and then to Balmaceda. On the way back I flew to Santiago, then Cancun, and then back home. You will most likely need to fly from Santiago to Balmaceda, it is the easiest way and there are a couple flights a day you can take. I flew with LATAM and it was easy. I had no qualms with my bike bag joining me on the journey and prepaid for it all beforehand. I use a soft sided EVOC case and my bike has made it safely everywhere I have gone so far.

Rental Car - You need a car. It is needed by your support person during the race, but also just to get around the region. The race provides you with contact to one company. I ended up using LYS rental cars instead. It was slightly cheaper though I was getting an SUV instead of a truck and my car had 4x2 instead of 4x4. But I did not need 4x4 for what I was on. Rental cars will be expensive. I think I paid more than $1000 for a week of the car, but it was brand new and easily fit my equipment with the back bench folded down. Also, Balmaceda is almost an hour drive from Coyhaique, which is the main city everything is based out of. Also a point of information, the speed limit is 80-100km/h on the highways. We did not see signs when we began driving and had to look it up.

Accommodations - The race has a deal with a hotel in Coyhaique for rooms. It is right next to the community centre where meetings happen, the check-in happens at the hotel, and Coyhaique is the largest city in the area and the half way area of the bike. However, I opted to get an AirBNB and found this awesome cabin overlooking a river that was located on a sheep ranch just outside Coyhaique. It had a bed for me and a bed for my support, a bathroom, kitchen, and wifi. We got daily visits from the livestock guardian dogs with their flock, we had access to a washer for our clothes, and could have asked for the hot tub, though that would have been an extra cost. It was also cheaper than the hotel, and it took 10 minutes to drive into Coyhaique for groceries or meetings. We were also lucky and our host was having a little get together to celebrate the start of spring when we arrived and we got to enjoy one of his lambs cooked over charcoal. It is the best lamb I have ever had and might ever have.

**The Race:** The days before - Since I flew into Mexico City, then Santiago, and then Balmaceda, I decided to take a couple days in each place on the way down. In Mexico City I ate as many tacos as I could. I also found out about how the city shuts down one of the major roads for people to run and bike on every Sunday. I took advantage of that and ran through Mexico City seeing different statues and monuments. It is a very well organised event with aid stations and tons of people out on the road. The plan was to use the exercise bike in the apartment building we were staying in for bike sessions and to hit up a local pool to get some laps in. Unfortunately this is when I started to get sick. At first I thought I was feeling effects of the altitude and air pollution but when a day off did not improve things, I started getting meds into me. In hindsight, I should have purchased a bunch of medicine here and brought it with me.

We flew to Santiago where all I could really manage was some walks in the city, and a swim in the pool the apartment had. Only a few hundred meters of swimming before I felt awful again. I tried to find meds for what was developing, and the pharmacies would give me different cough syrups based on my google translated symptoms, but the meds just do not hit the same as at home. By the time we left Santiago for Balmaceda, my sinuses were fully clogged and I could barely hear anymore. 

In Patagonia, I started to feel better. Less snot and coughing, the sore throat went away, and I started getting my rides, runs, and swims in. We drove as much of the bike course as we could so I could see where there was construction and missing pavement. I did some riding and tackled some of the hills to get an idea of what to expect. I did open water swims from the beach that would be used for the social swim, and I found national parks to go check out while running and gravel roads to run on. The people there are awesome and I got a lot of thumbs ups and honks on my bike rides. I also was given a lot more space when vehicles passed me and they always waited for it to be safe before passing which I was not used to.

My sickness suddenly came back hard about 5 days out from the race. I was doing an easy run with my friend when in my head I was just like, I need to go to the hospital, something is not right, I should not be this sick suddenly out of nowhere. So we finished the run and as my friend ran up to me I said, ""I need to go to the hospital"". So we headed there where I was diagnosed with RSV and given a bunch of meds to deal with the symptoms. My sinuses and throat finally cleared up but I was still very tired, had a cough I could not shake, and would randomly get hot and cold flashes. I should mention I work in healthcare and at this point a lot of my team back home were experiencing the same thing, but I did not know this. But after the fact it became apparent I had both RSV and Influenza A at the same time. 

The last couple days I just focussed on trying to rest, make sure my equipment and nutrition were ready, and not get too down about my condition. My parents flew in as well, which was a boost to see them. I also moved from my place in Coyhaique to a place in Peurto Aysen so that my drive would be 15 minutes to the race start.

I was not sure if I would start the race with my illness. I decided it would be a race day decision and to just get prepared. The day before the race, a local drowned in the port we would do the swim in. There was questions on if we would do the swim at all, let alone the full swim distance. We were told that the decision would be sent out that evening. I did not see the decision before I went to bed, but went to bed expecting a full distance swim.

**Race Day:** I woke up at about 2.30am to start getting ready for the race. There was an email announcing the full distance of the race. I got some food in me and a little caffeine. I don't drink coffee so I was using an energy drink. I also finished off some gatorade and a bunch of water to try and make sure I was hydrated for race start. Around 3.15am we started heading to the start in Peurto Chacabuco. You can start setting up bikes at 4am which is when I got there. I was still sipping on water and had mixed some electrolytes in with it. The weather was beautiful. I had heard it always rained at the start but it was 12 degrees which no wind. This was my first hint that the water was going to be warm. I got my bike set up and put on my wetsuit, boots, gloves, hood, and swim buoy. The ferry started loading and I headed on. I had disposable heat packs stashed under my wetsuit on my chest close to where many of the main arteries and vessels run to stay warm on the ride to the start point. I also brought a disposable bottle with my electrolyte water which I sipped and then disposed of with the heat packs in the ship's garbage. Soon they turned the hoses on which I stood under to get a good layer of water between my wetsuit and skin to help me stay warm when I jumped in the water. They did announcements and the safety briefing and then we started getting in the water. There was about 220 people who started the race, we all got off the boat and into the water in about 2 minutes. Once the last person hits the water, the horn sounds and we started swimming.

The swim was to another boat across the port, around it, and then back to where we got on the ferry. The water was the same temperature as what I swam in during the fall at about 15 degrees. Usually they expect 11-13 degrees. This meant there was not the sting to the face you get in colder water. I swam a straight line to the other ship and then to shore. Others swam in a big pack that had a bit of a deviation. I did not want to swim in the pack despite not having the ability to draft in the water. I was coughing randomly and fighting to not aspirate water when it happened with my head underwater. Being in a pack seemed like if I had to pop up to breath, I may get run into or swam over and it would be dangerous. So I stayed out wide from the group and did end up stopping for about 3 big coughing fits. My thought starting the race was if I could finish the swim, I could do the rest. I found out after the race, my Mom was so worried for me in the water, luckily my friend was able to track me and show her that I was still moving and making progress. I had packed my phone in my swim buoy and it was sending tracking info to him. FYI, you are encouraged to have your phone with you in case of emergencies, more so on the bike or in the run of you have service. I got an esim from Nomad I think and it had me covered over a lot of the race. Best to check coverage aps as some esims barely cover the race course. But, I finished the swim in 1hr40 and stumbled out of the water and towards my bike, my friend there helping to strip my wetsuit off and get my bike gear on.

For the bike I opted to wear light thermal bibs, a long sleeve jersey, and aero shoe covers and gloves. I ride a BMC Time Machine that I set up with an Aliexpress aerobars setup I went with after a bunch of research. My bike is running Di2, I upgraded to an 11sp setup for this race which allowed me to run a 36T rear cassette. I have 60mm carbon rims and run GP5000 TT TR rubber. I chugged a small thermos of hot sweet tea while getting changed. I mounted my carb mix (white sugar and dextrose with 1000mg of sodium/hr) between my arms with a fairing full of water and a straw to access it. I also had an extra bottle of water behind my seat as well as a bottle full of all my bike tools for emergency roadside repairs. The day was supposed to stay cool and light winds until the late afternoon. I got riding and made good progress, passing many people on the flat ride to the first big climb. My support would hopscotch me, with me deciding to stop or not every 20 or so kilometers. If I did not need him I would yell out the next kilometer mark to go to and continue on. I had decided to ride very easily with how I was feeling. I rode closer to 150W when my Zone 2 rides are usually above 200W and my FTP is 311W. I was still going for finishing the race and knew being this sick, I would need as much as I could get for the climbing at the end of the bike and for the run.

Just before the 90km aid station on a bumpy downhill with a large group all in the same area my fuel bottle between my arms popped out of its holder and landed in the opposite lane where is quickly was run over and I saw it explode. I continued to the aid station and took in a bunch of nutrition offered there. I also messaged my support telling him to be at the 100km mark, as we were not supposed to get support within 10km of either side of the aid station. I got him to take a bottle of Coke I stashed in the car and add sodium to it. I continued on and met him and got my water refilled and the new bottle of fuel. From there we met up 2 more times before I met him in transition.

The bike is windy. Usually you get a tailwind from the swim towards Coyhaique, then a cross wind as you head south and then a headwind doing all the climbs and descent to the transition. There was no tailwind. It was a slight headwind leaving the swim. The crosswind was there heading south and the wind picked up something fierce heading into the climbs and then switchback descent. I had to fight my way down the whole descent. With 60mm deep sections, I got battered back and forth as I came around the switchbacks. I had to slow down quite a bit to not lose it. There was also a straight 3% grade downhill straight into the wind and I had to pedal so I did not lose speed. The winds can be insane. Be ready to ride in them. I took my full disc which I had been using for training rides in the area and replaced it with the 60mm because I did not trust the weather report of lower winds.

During the bike, the weather report also got everything wrong. It was supposed to be cool and cloudy. It quickly changed to sunny and hot. With my helmet and visor, I did not notice this and did not put sunscreen on until I got to the run. A couple days later I found the aftermath of that decision with blisters on my neck and peeling skin on my lower face. Others really suffered in the sudden heat and ended up not finishing. My parents had to help one athlete out and he was not doing well and did not know where his support was. So my tip, bring your phone. Pack it away so you do not use it while biking but if you need it for an emergency, you have it. It took me just over 7 hours to finish the bike.

The run started out as a scorcher. I got into my running gear. I had brought a selection of gear to pick based on the weather when I finished the bike. I decided on some light shorts, a light short sleeve shirt, a visor, and a backpack but no water bladder. I went with the extra large reusable flasks. One with water, the other with enough carbs and sodium to get me to the halfway mark and the 20km aid station, and a ziploc with the fuel to go the rest of the way. The initial run was tough. My legs were moving but it felt awful, not how I usually feel during my bricks, even my post long bike runs, but I guess I was pretty sick and that is not unexpected.

I covered the paved section following my run strategy for the race, run the flats and downhills and walk the uphills. I made it to the gravel and was feeling good. My legs came to me, I was still wanting to ingest my carbs, and I was loving the scenery around me.After a while you move onto trails and I was moving well across those, even passing some people. Now, from all my research, I for sure thought the stream you had to ford was closer to the 30km mark. So when I came across a bog I thought this was just an anomaly for this year. I crossed it fine until the last step when my feet sunk in mud. Luckily I had gortex Salomons on and the mus stayed outside. I came around the corner and there was the stream. I ran through and immediately realised that my shoes kept mud out and but also water in. I had to sit down and wring out my socks before continuing. Luckily my shoes dried out within a couple km. At the 8km mark you rejoin gravel road. I continued with my run-walk strategy and passed the 10km mark. 

As I made my way towards the 20km station I started to feel like trash. I checked and I was still on track with my nutrition but I pulled out some candy I had stashed in a pocket and ate it. My hands started to get numb, my lips were numb, and I realised this is the stuff the patients I see at work experience before they get put on oxygen. But our elevation is lower than where I live so it cannot be from that. Then I noticed I was breathing very shallow and if I tried to breath deeper, I would go into a coughing fit. I was going hypoxic. I started walking, trying to get oxygen back into my body. I got to the 20km mark and pulled my flasks out to refill and mix my new batch of nutrition. They were out of water. I was trying my best not to puke from the borderline hypoxia, I just wanted some water, and there was none. They had gatorade. So I filled my flasks with gatorade. My nutrition was insane to try and drink. It was so sugary. And instead of water I had to sip gatorade to the next aid station where I hoped they had water.

I left the station as quick as I could so no one would pick up how gross I was feeling. That is when my watch died. I had no way of knowing what time it was, where I was, anything. I was still walking and I kept walking. Eventually my hands and lips went back to feeling normal and I stopped feeling so gross. But I was getting worried about not getting to 30km before the cutoff. I asked people around me what time it was and how far in we were but all I got were jokes about how we need to keep going or I just got fully ignored. I started to panic and so started trying to run again. At this point i was looking for a stream ford so I would see my support and be at 30km but I was seeing nothing. Everything was narrowing into a valley with a fast moving river and there was no way that would have a safe spot to ford. I thought I was maybe close to 25km when the road suddenly started some steep switchbacks down. At the bottom was a guy pointing us towards the river saying your support is so close. I made the turn and there was a bridge across the river and on the other side was my friend. I jogged my way across and he took me to the aid station. He had a bottle of Coke with him so I dumped my gatorade and filled it with water but kept my nutrition with me. I started drinking the Coke though as it was less sweet than my nutrition. I also tried to eat some bread, just to put something in my stomach.

There he told me I had beat the cutoff by more than an hour and had more than enough time to walk to the finish if i needed to. We started making our way towards the finish, just walking. We also had to battle off a ton of horse flies. I had been doing this the whole run but it got really bad after 30km. I would try to run a little but I kept feeling more and more like I was going to puke. With about 7km left and after urging from my friend I finally let my body throw up. Out came a lot of the fluid I had drank since the 30km and a chunk of bread. My esophagus also felt much better and not like I had fluid stuck in it. I was able to drink normally again. I think the bread might have been stuck and causing issues for the fluids to make it to my stomach. With \~2km left  we got back onto the pavement and I started running again. Locals came to their doors to cheer us past them and eventually I got to the finish. I rang the bell, got my medal, and was given a drink. I got one sip in and that was it, I could not stomach anything else. I finished the race in just over 16 hours.

There was showers available to use next to the finish. I took that shower and then we drove back to the first AirBNB. On the drive a drank so much chocolate milk and my body was very pro this move. When we got back to the AirBNB I crawled into bed and just zonked out. I do not usually sleep well after big events like this, but I was out out that night.

**Conclusion:** Overall, it was a great event. Well put together, they care about your safety, and everyone involved and in the general area are so nice, friendly, and amazing. I personally wish I could have been healthy and actually seen what I could have done, but I finished the race the sickest I have been in years. This tells me my training program and how I prepped was successful. Maybe one day I will return and do it again, but for now I need some time doing things I put aside over the last year and to go do some other new experiences. In your preparations, get used to cold water, get used to riding in wind, and book things as early as you can as prices increase quickly, and there are limited options due to the size of the area.

I will try and answer any other questions in the comments, but if you were interested, the draw is coming up so get into it, you can always say no if you get drawn and decide you would rather not. Thanks for reading my novel if you have!

In the reception room, Jason Yardley wore his green uniform and said with a look of pity, ""Ma'am, Colonel Howard said he does not want to see you. Please return to Betrico as soon as you can.""

Margaret Summers, who had been sitting nervously on the bench, widened her eyes and her face turned slightly pale. ""He really said that?""

""Yes."" Jason's expression grew even more sorrowful, because Richard Howard's words had been harsher, practically telling her to get lost.

At that, all the color drained from Margaret's face.

""No,"" she said. ""I won't leave. I'll wait here until he comes out.""

Margaret knew she was being shameless. She and Richard were already divorced, and it had been her shouting and demanding that had pushed him to the point where he finally agreed. After that, he had returned to the army in anger.

But she had no other choice. Thinking of the terrifying things she had seen in her dreams made her lips go pale.

Since Richard had left Betrico and returned to the army, she had been having nightmares every day.

In the dreams, just two weeks after their divorce, the entire country had descended into chaos.

Because of her mother's status, Margaret had been reported and exiled to a small town. The person who reported her had been her stepsister, Susan Summers, whom she had always treated like a real sister.

Margaret was soon sent to one of the most remote towns in the country. For a woman like her, being there was like a sheep entering a den of wolves.

Sure enough, it wasn't long before someone started plotting against her.

At first, the locals held back because she came from Betrico and dared not go too far. But as her background gradually became known, those with ill intentions began to stir.

First, some local thugs teased her with lewd comments. Then a group of matchmakers buzzed around like flies every day, trying to set her up with men.

The men they introduced were either hillbillies who couldn't get a wife or widowers. Margaret naturally refused.

Outside of work hours, she mostly stayed in her dorm and hardly dared to go out.

Later, someone found out about her divorce. Not only did the locals insult her openly with filthy language, but even her coworkers considered her a disgrace and forced her out of the dormitory.

Margaret, who had nowhere to go, was dragged by an old widower to his place. He tried to force her to have his child.

She could not endure the humiliation. When the old man tried to rape her, she pulled out a knife she had hidden and, without hesitation, stabbed him.

The man died on the spot.

Margaret was immediately arrested for murder. She was facing a death sentence, but her belly had started to swell.

Counting the time, she was already four or five months pregnant.

In the end, Margaret was sentenced to life imprisonment.

While she worked in the prison labor camp, heavily pregnant and miserable, Susan appeared. She was dressed elegantly and had become the lead dancer of the military band, admired by everyone.

Susan sneered. ""Margaret, you're even dumber than I thought. I just stirred things up a little, and you left your man without thinking. And now you're a prisoner.

""Too bad that stupid old man was weak. Otherwise, you'd have spent the rest of your life like a pig, doing nothing but giving him children.

""From now on, you and your kid can rot in prison. I wonder if Richard will go mad when he finds out.""

Margaret didn't know if Richard would go mad, because she herself had already lost her mind.

It turned out Susan was the illegitimate daughter of her father, Charles Summers, and Margaret's mother had been poisoned by her stepmother, who seemed gentle but was actually ruthless.

When Margaret thought about how she had been fooled by her stepmother and stepsister, how she had cut ties with her grandfather and indirectly caused his death, her eyes burned with rage.

She never imagined that Pamela, the woman who claimed to be her mother's best friend, had long ago been involved with Charles and even had given birth to a bastard child.

Margaret looked at Susan, whose face was twisted with wild triumph, and her vision turned red.

When she came to, she had already grabbed a stone and smashed Susan's head several times, blood pooling all around.

In the chaos, she heard a few gunshots.

Pain exploded through her body. She fell to the ground. As she closed her eyes, she saw Richard, eyes wide with fury.

Margaret was dead, yet not completely gone. She felt herself floating in midair.

She saw that Richard had truly gone mad, just like Susan had said.

He clutched Margaret's body, refusing to let go. Even when someone struck him unconscious, his hands still held her tightly, as if welded to her.

It took a long time for others to finally pull Richard away. When he woke up, he didn't say a word.

He took revenge on Charles, Pamela, and Pamela's family with thunderous brutality. One by one, they all met grim ends.

Richard was sentenced to death for killing Pamela. When he died, he still held a photo of Margaret in his hands.

The scenes from that dream were so brutal that Margaret couldn't recover for several days.

At first, she didn't even believe they could be real. But as each event in her dream that could have changed the course of history unfolded, panic set in.

Without thinking further, she applied for a visitor pass and took a car straight to Richard on Havenport Island in the south.

By now, less than a week remained until the chaos she had seen in her dream would begin. If Richard refused to see her, Margaret couldn't imagine what would happen to her.

""Private Yardley, did you tell him I'm pregnant?"" Margaret assumed Jason hadn't explained properly; otherwise, Richard wouldn't have been so cold.

Jason's expression flickered strangely, but he answered obediently, ""I told him, but he didn't believe me.""

In fact, Richard hadn't just disbelieved him. He had flown into a rage and told Jason to tell Margaret to get lost.

Margaret staggered, her face ghostly pale.

But it wasn't surprising. Only ten days had passed since she and Richard had last slept together. With so little time, there was no way Margaret, who wasn't a doctor, could have known she was pregnant. Her claim sounded unconvincing.

Besides, she had only had a few nightmares and couldn't truly confirm her pregnancy.

""Fine."" With that, Margaret picked up her luggage and walked out of the reception room, dazed and defeated.

The summer sun burned on her skin, but Margaret seemed not to feel it at all.

She walked out of the base in a daze, wandering through the completely unfamiliar streets of Havenport, her face blank and lost.

She couldn't be completely sure if the things in her dream were real. Coming to find Richard with such humility had drained every bit of courage she had.

He refused to see her, and she didn't have the face to press the matter inside the base. She could only wait somewhere not too far from the gate, hoping he might come out.

Clinging to that small hope, Margaret sat on a stone by the side of the road. She waited until the sun had set, but Richard never appeared.

Suddenly, the sky darkened. Thick clouds were racing across the horizon, heading straight for the spot above her head.

Before long, a fierce wind picked up, whipping sand and stones across the ground, stinging her eyes.

She barely had time to realize it was about to rain when large drops began to pelt her.

In an instant, the raindrops turned into a heavy sheet, drumming on her from all sides. Soon, she was soaked through.

Margaret tried to find shelter, but aside from the base, there were no buildings around.

As she hesitated, she saw a tall man striding toward her, anger radiating from every step.

It was Richard.

Chapter 2 I Don't Want A Divorce Anymore
""Margaret. Are you an idiot?"" Richard shouted. ""It's pouring out here and you didn't even think to find some shelter?""

Hearing his familiar explosive tone, Margaret nearly burst into tears.

""Richard..."" She grabbed his arm, clinging to him like a homeless stray, pitiful and desperate.

""Stop it,"" Richard snapped, trying to pull his arm free.

But Margaret had waited far too long to finally see him. There was no way she was letting go. Instead, she tightened her grip, wrapping both arms around him as if afraid he might disappear at any second.

""Richard, I'm sorry,"" she said earnestly. ""I know I was wrong. I don't want a divorce.""

He could feel her soft chest pressed firmly against his arm, and his expression darkened.

""Margaret, what kind of trick are you playing this time?"" he said through clenched teeth. ""You were the one who asked for the divorce. I already filed the paperwork, and now you're telling me you regret it?""

""I'm not playing tricks. I just don't want a divorce anymore. I regret it. Can you withdraw the filing?"" Her voice trembled with tears. Under the pounding rain, she looked even more fragile than before.

""Damn it. You think I'll do whatever you say?"" Richard was furious. He grabbed her arm and dragged her toward the base.

He was tall, with long strides, and Margaret couldn't keep up when he was angry. She had no choice but to stumble along behind him, half running, completely disheveled.

Jason stared at Richard in shock, then at Margaret being hauled along beside him.

He thought, 'Didn't Colonel Howard tell me to send her as far away as possible? He'd even said she would damage his reputation. So what was this?'

But Jason didn't dare ask or gossip. He just obediently registered the information for the notoriously hot-tempered colonel.

Margaret didn't dare ask anything either. She didn't say a single word, only clutched Richard's uniform like a lifeline.

Jason finished the paperwork quickly.

Richard grabbed a piece of oilcloth from somewhere and threw it over Margaret's head, then dragged her toward the military guesthouse at a brisk pace.

Margaret clutched his clothes with one hand and held onto the oilcloth with the other, utterly flustered and looking even more miserable.

Luckily, the guesthouse wasn't far. Conditions in Havenport were harsh. Not only were the barracks basic, even the guesthouse was nothing more than a row of plain, connected one-story rooms.

After another round of registration, Richard led her into one of the rooms.

The door creaked open, and the inside was pitch-black, nothing visible at all.

With a soft click, a dim yellow bulb flickered on. The light wavered, probably due to unstable power.

Once inside, Richard shook her hand off.

""So tell me,"" he said, folding his arms and looking at her coldly. ""What do you want this time?""

Margaret felt awkward. She couldn't exactly tell him that she had come after having terrifying nightmares and glimpses of the future.

Lowering her head, she muttered, ""I just regret it. I don't want a divorce anymore.""

Richard scoffed. ""If you won't tell the truth, I'm leaving. Tomorrow, you go back to Betrico.""

With that, he turned and headed for the door.

Panic hit Margaret at once. Without thinking, she wrapped her arms around his waist. ""Don't go.""

Her soft body pressed tightly against his back. In the past, that alone would have driven him wild with joy.

But now, he was livid.

""Margaret, what exactly are you trying to do?"" he asked. ""Is messing with me really that fun?""

She had always complained that he was too rough and not romantic enough. The one time he finally came back, she hadn't given him a single kind look.

Richard had swallowed all of that. What he couldn't swallow was watching her climb onto Lucas Sterling's bike right in front of him, then saying that compared to Lucas, he was nothing but a loser, without the slightest regard for his pride.

He still remembered every harsh word she had thrown at him. And now she was telling him she regretted it.

Margaret knew exactly how unforgivable she had been ten days ago. But the images from her dream made her tremble all over.

She couldn't go back to Betrico. If she did, there would be nothing waiting for her but death.

With that thought, she slowly let go of him.

Richard mocked himself in silence for being stupid enough to let her trample over him again and again.

His face dark, he didn't look back as he said coldly, ""I have things to take care of. Go back on your own tomorrow.""

As he spoke, he strode toward the door.

But he hadn't reached the door when Margaret's soft hands suddenly wrapped around his waist again.

Richard lifted a hand, about to pull her arms away. Then he froze. The feel under his palm was wrong.

There was no fabric at all, and he could feel the tenderness of her bare skin.

This realization made his face flush bright red.

""Margaret, what are you doing?"" he demanded through clenched teeth, yanking her hands away.

But in the very next second, she threw herself into his arms. Suddenly seeing her exposed body made his eyes widen in shock.

""Don't go, Richard,"" she said. ""Don't leave me.""

Margaret had run out of options. She knew Richard wanted her. If she agreed to sleep with him even once, he would do everything he could to keep her from ever leaving his side.

That was exactly why she had been afraid of him.

She knew what she was doing was shameful. But compared to her life, pride no longer mattered. She wanted to live.

She didn't want to go to that small town. She didn't want to be forced to marry that disgusting old widower.

""Damn. What do you take me for?"" Richard was nearly beside himself with rage.

Not long ago, she had gone on a hunger strike to force him into a divorce. Now she had come here to seduce him. He made up his mind that he would not give in to her, not even once.

His face cold, Richard pried her hands off his waist.

Margaret went pale with fear. In her panic, she reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing her lips to his.

""Richard, I'm sorry. Don't be mad..."" she murmured, clumsily kissing him as she spoke.

Richard's mind went completely blank.

When he finally snapped out of it, he gritted his teeth and forced himself to push her away. He hurriedly grabbed a blanket from the bed and wrapped it around her.

Wrapped up like that, Margaret looked ghostly pale.

She couldn't believe he truly didn't love her anymore. In her dream, he had gone to that small town to find her, and in the end, he had even been sentenced to death for her. She wondered if all those dreams meant nothing.

She clutched the blanket tightly, like a helpless stray, lost and pitiful.

""All right,"" she said softly, lowering her eyes. ""I'm sorry to bother you. I'll leave tomorrow.""

She felt she never should have come to find him.

Dreams weren't reality. In reality, she had hurt him too deeply, and he would never forgive her.

Chapter 3 This Isn't A Place For You
Richard left.

Margaret stood there in a daze for a moment before opening her duffel bag, trying to find something dry to change into.

But every piece of clothing inside was soaked through. With no other choice, she hung them up, hoping they might dry by morning.

The clothes she was wearing were soaked as well. Earlier, she had only taken off her top. The rest still clung damply to her skin, uncomfortable and cold.

Since no one was coming anyway, she took off her pants too and hung them up to dry.

Her stomach growled loudly with hunger.

The moment she got off the train, she had come straight here. She only had a hundred dollars on her, and she didn't dare spend much.

After going hungry for most of the day, Margaret started to feel lightheaded.

Even so, she couldn't bring herself to care about the hunger. Through the small window, she watched the heavy rain pouring down outside, turning the scenes from her dreams over and over in her mind.

Since Richard refused to take her back, she had to find another way to save herself.

There was less than a week left before the unrest began.

She wondered if she could strike first, report Susan and Pamela before she herself was reported.

But she had no proof that Susan was Charles's illegitimate daughter. Bringing down Susan and Pamela directly wouldn't be easy, and there wasn't enough time.

She bit her finger, racking her brain, but no solution came.

The only way left to get out of danger quickly was to reconcile with Richard.

As long as she stayed on this military base, Susan and Pamela couldn't touch her.

But that path was already closed.

Lost in thought, she had no idea how much time had passed when she suddenly heard the sound of a key sliding into the lock.

""Who's there?"" Margaret startled, quickly wrapping the blanket around her bare body. Her voice shook badly.

The door creaked open. Richard's sharp, well-defined face appeared in the doorway.

Seeing him, Margaret was surprised. She couldn't understand why he had come back.

Richard still looked displeased. After entering, he set the oilcloth aside and took a lunch box and a set of green military uniform from his coat.

""Here,"" he said. ""Eat.""

Margaret stared at him, clearly unable to understand what he meant. She thought he was so sick of her that he didn't even want to see her anymore.

""No... it's fine. I'm not hungry,"" she said softly, clutching the blanket tighter as she lowered her gaze.

After being rejected by him, she felt nothing but shame and embarrassment. She wanted nothing more than to keep her distance. She didn't want to be alone in a room with him like this, half-dressed and exposed.

Earlier, she had taken off her hair tie to let her hair dry. Her long, beautiful hair spilled down, half-veiling her delicate face and making her look even more fragile.

Richard's eyes were cold, his voice edged with mockery. ""What, trying that hunger strike again? Too bad. It doesn't work on me anymore.""

Margaret was left speechless, reminded of the time she had used starvation to force him into a divorce. Not wanting to argue, she said, ""Just leave it on the table. I'll eat later.""

Her face was pale, her eyes slightly swollen, as if she had been crying.

The lowered gaze carried a distant chill, as though she had already made up her mind to leave this place for good, to leave Richard behind.

Richard let out a self-mocking smile. He didn't think she was any different from before. She would rather die than stay married to him, and this was probably just another trick to toy with him.

She had always been like this, but he no longer had the strength to endure her games again.

""Eat something and get some rest tonight. Tomorrow, I'll have someone take you to the station,"" Richard said, his tone flat and emotionless.

Margaret's heart sank.

She didn't try to stop him anymore. She lowered her gaze and nodded. ""Okay.""

His attitude was clear. Even if she had given up her pride, she couldn't keep pushing.

Even though she had agreed to go back to Betrico, Richard felt no relief. A mixture of irritation and suffocating frustration bubbled up inside him, but he forced it down hard.

He wasn't going to fall for her tricks again.

Last year, when she softened toward him, he thought he'd finally won her over. But then she turned around, yelled at him, and said she could love anyone but him.

This year was even more outrageous. When he returned, she seemed fine. But soon enough, she wanted a divorce.

And then she even got on Lucas's bike. She had gone so far as to starve herself just to push him into the divorce, all for Lucas.

Thinking of that scene, Richard felt his anger threaten to consume him again.

Before he realized it, his fists were clenched. His voice went cold and hard. ""You better mean what you say. Go back to Lucas. This isn't a place for you.""

He was done with her drama.

Hearing him mention Lucas, Margaret suddenly straightened, her eyes full of urgency. ""Lucas and I...""

However, Richard cut her off sharply. ""Enough. I don't care what's between you two. I'm taking the team out for drills tomorrow. I don't have time to play games with you.""

He didn't look at her again, turning and walking out the door.

Watching his furious back, Margaret slumped onto the bed, completely drained.

But she didn't blame him. Everything was her own fault. She had believed Susan's lies, used another man to force him into a divorce.

Thinking of Lucas, the man she had believed to be a gentleman, Margaret clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

In her dream, she had been sent to that small town so quickly because of Lucas's instigation.

And now, Lucas was about to cozy up to the Civic Council.

Just thinking about it made Margaret feel an urgency she couldn't shake off.

She got out of bed and, after locking the door behind her, changed into the military uniform Richard had brought. It was a women's cut, and surprisingly, it fit her perfectly.

Margaret didn't like wearing uniforms, nor did she like soldiers. She thought they were all too rough, just like Richard.

But once she put the uniform on, a feeling she couldn't quite describe stirred inside her.

Richard hated her so much, yet he still had the grace to bring her clothes and food. She thought she'd better respect his wishes and go back to Betrico as soon as possible.

After getting dressed, her stomach growled again. She didn't bother with hesitation and opened the aluminum mess kit. Under the lid, she saw crispy bacon, beans, and lettuce.

To her surprise, all the bacon in the box was lean bacon.

Looking at the full meal packed into the mess kit, Margaret felt a strange urge to cry.

Before, she had been full of prejudice against Richard and hadn't noticed such details. Now that she had let go of her biases, she realized just how wrong her assumptions about him had been.

Most people preferred bacon with streaks of fat and lean. But Margaret was different. She had always only eaten the lean parts.

Even her grandfather hadn't noticed her preference, yet Richard remembered it so clearly.

But there was no way to win Richard back now. She had already stripped and tried to seduce him, yet he hadn't flinched in the slightest.

Perhaps not everything in her dreams was real.

After Margaret finished her meal, the rain gradually stopped.

She fetched some water, cleaned the kit, and sat on the bench to dry her hair.

As she was patting her hair, she suddenly noticed a red dot flash across her wrist.

Margaret froze and lifted her hand, only to see a small, vivid red mole had appeared on her wrist, though she had no idea when it had gotten there.

Curious, she reached out to touch it, wondering if it was just a drop of paint.

But the next second, a wave of dizziness hit her, and she found herself somewhere strange.

Margaret gasped, unsure of where she was.

Chapter 4 A Book From The Future
Margaret saw a clear spring, and beyond it stretched a vast field filled with all kinds of crops.

In her dream, she had only worked in a small town for a few months, but she still recognized most ordinary crops.

The fields held not just wheat, but corn, sweet potatoes, and a variety of vegetables, even fruits. Every single one of them was ripe.

Seeing the trees heavy with red apples in the distance, Margaret swallowed hard.

The apples looked tempting. If she didn't care about being a thief, she would have plucked one to taste.

But before the thought fully formed, an apple that had been hanging in the tree suddenly appeared in her hand.

Margaret froze.

She stared at the apple in her hand, dumbfounded. She blinked, then looked at a nearby peach tree and silently thought, 'A peach.'

The next second, a plump, pink peach appeared in her hand.

She touched the velvety fuzz with her fingertips and felt the fruit's firmness, as if a little pressure would burst its sweet juice through the glossy skin.

It was real, not a hallucination. Yet she still didn't understand where she was or what it had to do with the mole on her wrist.

Thinking of the mole, another wave of dizziness hit her. The scene instantly shifted to the small, bare room in the mess hall, but the apple and peach were still in her hands.

Margaret stared at the fragrant, inviting fruit, and her heart skipped a beat.

A startling thought came to her. She could use the mole to enter the space she had just visited, and everything in that space responded to her control.

To test it, she tried to enter the space again.

Sure enough, as soon as the thought crossed her mind, Margaret appeared inside the space.

She tried plucking two plums.

As long as she thought about it, whatever was in the space would appear in her hands, without exception.

Margaret explored further and found that, besides crops, the space held chickens, ducks, pigs, fish, and other animals.

There was also a strange house. She couldn't quite tell what it was made of—wood, maybe, but slightly different.

It looked small from the outside, yet the interior was absurdly spacious.

That wasn't even the main point. The house was packed with all kinds of supplies, many of which Margaret had never seen before. Everything she could imagine, she could find there.

Alongside the supplies, one entire wall was filled with books. Margaret pulled out one and found it was History of Clusia, covering events from the founding of the nation all the way to 2030.

'A book from the future?' she thought.

Margaret raised her eyebrows. She flipped quickly to the table of contents and found the year when the unrest in her dream had started.

As she expected, the book was indeed from the future. Every major event she had seen in her dreams was recorded here.

But she still didn't understand why Richard's attitude toward her was so cold, nothing like what she had seen in her dream.

That didn't matter anymore. She now had this space and this book. She was sure she could find a way to protect herself.

Margaret held the book as if it were a priceless treasure, her hands trembling as she continued flipping through the pages.

Soon, she saw that the unrest would last for ten years, and during that time, the SAT exams would be canceled, only resuming once the turmoil ended.

Margaret read the book word by word, afraid of missing any important detail.

She read through the entire night.

She dozed off briefly in a rush, and when she woke again, the sky was fully bright.

Rubbing her dry eyes, Margaret climbed out of bed.

The clothes she had hung to dry last night were half-dry. She folded them neatly and packed them back into her bag.

Margaret planned to return to Betrico today. The sooner she went back, the more opportunities she would have to take the initiative.

She moved quickly, and soon she was ready.

At the far end of the row of houses on the right was the washroom. After a quick wash, she grabbed some food from the space to fill her stomach and then headed out with her luggage.

The middle-aged woman in charge of registration looked at her with curiosity a few times. Margaret gave an awkward smile, said nothing, and walked past.

But before she could reach the gate, a young soldier stopped her.

""Mrs. Howard, Major General Carter requests you in his office,"" the soldier said.

Margaret was surprised. She didn't understand why Benjamin Carter wanted to see her.

Still, she managed a smile. ""Just call me Ms. Summers. Could you show me where Major General Carter's office is?""

Richard had made up his mind about divorcing her. She shouldn't be called Mrs. Howard anymore.

The soldier looked slightly puzzled at her words, but he obediently changed how he addressed her.

Margaret followed him toward Benjamin's office.

*****

In the office, Benjamin was bent over, writing something.

When he saw Margaret enter, he stood up and greeted her with a warm smile. ""Mrs. Howard, please have a seat.""

He poured her a cup of hot coffee and kindly asked, ""Did you get any rest last night? I know the guesthouse is basic. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.""

Margaret held the cup, feeling the gentle warmth against her fingertips. ""Thank you for your concern, Major General Carter. I rested well.""

""I heard you're a top graduate from Betrico Institute of Technology,"" Benjamin said with genuine admiration. ""We could really use young talents like you here. Richard is lucky to be your husband.""

Hearing Richard's name, Margaret instinctively tightened her grip on the cup. The coffee sloshed, spilling a few drops onto the back of her hand, but she didn't notice.

""Major General Carter, I..."" she looked up, forcing a bitter smile. ""I'm returning to Betrico today.""

Benjamin frowned and put down the pen in his hand.

""Why so soon? Does Richard know?"" he asked.

""He's already filed for divorce,"" Margaret said so quietly it was almost a whisper. ""He's the one asking me to leave.""

The office fell into a brief silence. Outside, the soldiers' morning drills rang out with sharp, energetic shouts, a stark contrast to her heavy mood.

Benjamin looked surprised. ""Divorce? I don't recall him mentioning that.""

Margaret's head snapped up, a flash of confusion crossing her face. ""He didn't? He told me he already submitted it.""

She had been the one to push him.

Benjamin chuckled. ""I think there might be some misunderstanding between you two. Richard wouldn't want a divorce. He even submitted a request for you to accompany him on his transfer.""

Margaret's shock deepened.

""T-transfer request?"" she stammered.

""That's right. His application was already approved,"" Benjamin nodded, pulling a document from the drawer.

Margaret took the paper, her fingers trembling slightly. Richard's signature was clear, the date marked a month ago.

So he came home intending to take her with him on the transfer, and she had almost driven him to file for divorce out of anger.

Chapter 5 I'll Stay
""I do not know what misunderstanding lies between the two of you,"" Benjamin said earnestly, ""but the fact that you became husband and wife means there was love there. Besides, Havenport needs people like you. Stay. Give each other a chance.""

Margaret looked toward the rising sun outside the window. The sea breeze carried a damp, salty scent. The file in her hands felt heavy, as if it held the unspoken sincerity of a stubborn man who did not know how to say what he felt.

After a long while, she nodded. ""All right. I'll stay.""

No matter what Richard truly thought, she needed this chance to stay here.

When Margaret came out again, she was still carrying the same travel bag, but there was now a document folder in her other hand.

After receiving Benjamin's orders, the young soldier led her all the way to the Family Quarters.

The Family Quarters were also inside the base, but separated by a wall and accessed through an iron gate.

According to the soldier, officers' wives usually didn't enter through the main gate of the base. They used a smaller gate set aside for the Family Quarters. Soldiers also had to register to enter the Family Quarters and were required to use that same gate.

There were militia guards stationed at the entrance. The soldier took the documents from Margaret and asked her to register her information, then led her to a single story building.

Margaret looked up and saw the sign on the door. Family Committee Office.

The soldier knocked. ""Mrs. Lane, Colonel Howard's wife is here. Before leaving for field training, he instructed me to bring her to complete the family registration.""

A short, firm voice came from inside. ""Come in.""

The soldier gestured politely to Margaret.

Margaret instinctively tightened her grip on the travel bag. She took a quiet breath before stepping into the office.

Inside, a woman with short hair was bent over her paperwork.

Without looking up, she spoke briskly. ""Did you bring everything? Marriage certificate, approval for accompanied service, and identification. Nothing can be missing.""

Margaret held onto the accompanying service documents, still feeling a faint sense of unreality.

After a brief pause, she opened the folder and placed the papers on the desk.

Ruby finally looked up.

Her sharp gaze settled on Margaret. After a few seconds, she said, ""You are Colonel Richard Howard's wife, right? Fill out the registration form first. The fountain pen is here. No corrections allowed.""

Margaret nodded and replied calmly, ""All right. Thank you, Mrs. Lane.""

She picked up the pen and the form, then sat down and began filling it out carefully.

Her neat handwriting appeared stroke by stroke on the clean white paper. Anyone could tell how serious she was.

Sure enough, when the form was completed, there was not a single correction mark on it.

A flicker of surprise crossed Ruby's eyes.

Taking the form, she reviewed the documents. After confirming that everything was in order, she issued Margaret a housing eligibility certificate, base access authorization, and a military dependent ID card with a photo.

Margaret took the documents, her face filled with curiosity.

Before she could examine them more closely, Ruby's slightly stern voice sounded again. ""The Family Quarters are different from the outside. There are many rules here. Since you have decided to accompany your husband, you need to adapt to life here as soon as possible.""

Margaret assumed this was a routine reminder and did not think much of it. She nodded. ""I understand. Thank you, Mrs. Lane. I will adjust to life in the Family Quarters as quickly as I can.""

Seeing her unexpectedly eager attitude, Ruby was even more surprised. Margaret did not look spoiled or willful as the rumors suggested, yet Ruby could not understand why Margaret's eyes appeared slightly swollen.

She kept those thoughts to herself, her expression giving nothing away.

Just then, a woman walked in. She had short, ear-length hair and wore a neat green uniform, looking clean and efficient.

""May, perfect timing. Colonel Howard's wife has arrived for the PCS,"" Ruby said, nodding toward Margaret. ""Take care of the arrangements.""

May Dean was a key member of the Family Committee and also the wife of Colonel Dean of the 2nd Battalion.

The moment she stepped in, she noticed Margaret, but she hadn't expected that Margaret was the well-known delicate wife of Colonel Howard from Betrico.

""Oh, so you're Colonel Howard's wife?"" May said, scanning Margaret from head to toe.

After a moment, she pursed her lips. ""Women from Betrico are really something else. You look like a porcelain doll. I don't know if you can handle life here.""

Margaret didn't know how to respond.

Ruby snorted, her tone neither harsh nor gentle. ""I told you to handle the arrangements. Why are you talking so much?""

Though her words sounded like a scolding, anyone could sense the subtle indulgence behind them.

May glanced at Ruby, clearly confused by her meaning.

Then her gaze returned to Margaret, and she pursed her lips again. ""Come on. I'll show you to your quarters.""

With that, she turned and walked straight out the door, not even looking back at Margaret.

The young soldier watched May's curt demeanor and couldn't help feeling a little worried.

He wasn't sure if he had done enough to settle Margaret in and feared Benjamin might later blame him over it.

Chapter 6 That's Your Reaction?
Margaret followed May, suitcase in hand, hurrying to keep up.

May was short, but she walked like she was on a mission. Margaret had to practically jog to keep pace.

Soon they reached the Family Quarters.

All the houses here were built to match, neat rows of identical facades stretching down the street.

The house May led her to was at the very end. A wall ran along the left side, and another house, just like hers, stood on the right.

Bright bougainvillea tumbled over the wall, a splash of color that made it clear the owner had a serious passion for gardening.

May noticed Margaret staring at the house next door. After being quiet the whole way, she finally spoke up. ""Do you know who lives next door?""

Margaret shook her head, unsure what May was getting at. But that glint in May's eyes told her it wasn't going to be anything good.

""No,"" she said softly.

May went on, ""The house next door belongs to Colonel Hayden Hammond and his wife, April. April is a big deal. She's a soloist in the military band. She's both pretty and talented.""

Margaret's breath caught. She immediately realized that May was talking about April Hammond, the same woman Susan had whispered about, the one rumored to have a complicated relationship with Richard. She hadn't expected April to be married, let alone live right next door.

Even though a storm of thoughts raged inside her, Margaret's face remained calm. She said coolly, ""Oh.""

May, surprised by her lack of reaction, pressed on. ""Back in the day, you wouldn't believe how many men admired her, wanted to marry her... but unfortunately...""

She trailed off, deliberately leaving the sentence unfinished, as if trying to pique Margaret's curiosity.

Margaret didn't respond. She pushed open the door and began surveying the place she was about to call home.

Seeing her so careless, May frowned and followed up, ""Aren't you curious what 'unfortunately' means?""

Margaret finally played along, asking without looking at her, ""What unfortunately?""

When she asked that, her eyes stayed on the yard. Anyone could tell her nonchalance.

The yard was surrounded by walls. Inside, it was bare except for the house. No greenery at all.

Directly in front were two single-story houses. In the left corner sat a small shed with a simple stove.

In the right corner, there were two low-lying buildings—one for showering, the other a bathroom.

The houses were modest, but functional, with all the necessary facilities.

May stared in disbelief, thinking Margaret's reaction was completely unusual. ""Aren't you at least a little curious about who your neighbors are?""

Margaret hadn't expected May to keep pushing, even with her careless attitude. She sighed. ""No. I'll meet her eventually.""

She could tell May was trying to stir trouble, so she refused to feed into it.

May's shoulders slumped. ""Fine. I'll just tell you. She used to write love letters to your husband.""

At that, Margaret finally glanced at her. ""Oh,"" she said, her tone still nonchalant.

She had already known this from Susan.

It had been one of the reasons she had considered divorcing Richard. She thought that he kept entangled with other women in the military yet still maintained their marriage.

Margaret had once believed Susan completely, but after having those dreams, all she felt now was doubt.

She couldn't trust Susan, and she certainly couldn't trust a stranger like May. She needed to find out the truth herself.

May nearly shouted in frustration. ""Really? That's your reaction?""

She wondered if Margaret didn't get what she meant. She couldn't believe a woman could keep her cool after hearing that her husband had received love letters from another woman.

Margaret looked at her seriously. ""What reaction am I supposed to have?""

May froze, unsure how to respond. After a moment, she said, ""Aren't you at least supposed to be a little angry?""

'A woman would normally be upset after hearing something like that, right?' May thought irritably, feeling like Margaret had completely thrown her off.

""Why should I be angry?"" Margaret asked in return.

""Why wouldn't you be?"" May's confusion grew. That was a woman who had secretly been in love with your husband, after all.

""She's married now,"" Margaret said.

May paused, realizing that her point wasn't entirely wrong.

April wouldn't risk her reputation by trying to seduce Richard or push for a divorce.

""Fine,"" May muttered, feeling a little bored without any drama. ""Later, go to the barracks office and register your furniture and things. Just get it from the staff there.""

She turned as if to leave, but the next moment, Margaret tugged on her sleeve.",1,1770080925.0,Novelnews,5,1.0,False

Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. Ive been in the news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media covered it. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it.

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

1qudrnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianParentAdvice/comments/1qudrnq/modesty_and_nudity_in_a_christian_home/,Modesty and nudity in a Christian home,"Hello. New around these parts. I'm considering a matter that I'm interested in Christian perspectives on. Here are my thoughts:

In my (34M) family of two young boys and my wife we are generally fully dressed around each other, and we're all ok with that. We value modesty. However, around a shower or so at least with the males of the home it isn't uncommon to shower with the door open and walk through the hall naked before getting dressed. Nobody seems to mind this. My wife tends to be more modest around the kids and only changes clothes or showers with the door shut and gets dressed before leaving the bathroom. This is all fine.

Again, to be clear, we value modesty. I'm considering the boundaries of nudity in our home in light of this. But also comfort and practicality are factors. If the kids aren't around I'd commonly enough hang around nude a bit after a shower to fully dry out. I don't tend to do that when the kids are around so that I am modeling modesty to them.

Is this brief amount of nudity too much?

I also know that for some folks sleeping in the nude is their norm. I don't tend to do that (usually I at least wear underwear) but after a certain point in the evening when everyone is settled in for the night we would be lounging about, watching TV, reading books, etc. in pajamas or loungewear. 

This is where I'm considering possibly being more ""open"" to more nudity and want to consider this in light of modesty:

For this same period of time of the evening through the early morning when we'd get up for breakfast and such, I wonder if we can accept more open nudity like we would accept wearing pajamas around the house. This is assuming nobody else is home and it is just us family settled in for the night at home before going to bed. Perhaps limiting it to the upstairs where the bedrooms and bathroom are, maybe also the living room. I consider this in the event that someone does sleep nude. I have a thought that this might be alright while otherwise maintaining and practicing modesty generally otherwise (e.g. in broad daylight around the house, for meals, etc. we'd be in clothes).

I really want to keep and uphold modesty, but also recognize the practical aspect to some nudity at home and role of home where we can be a bit more lax and comfortable and not expect the same amount of coverage in certain contexts, perhaps, compared to what we would in public, with guests around, or even in the full ""activity mode"" of the day. And this is, also, assuming everyone would be comfortable with it. Respect is also a high value such that more open nudity wouldn't be accepted if someone wasn't ok with it.

I'm not talking about sitting around having breakfast in the nude openly or anything like that. I'm thinking any meals would require clothing as a matter of modesty (as well as cleanliness, manners, etc.)  
What I'm talking about is more along the lines of taking a shower before bed, staying naked, getting a glass of water from the kitchen, sleeping nude, using bathroom in the morning, start a pot of coffee in the morning, all before getting dressed. And doing it all nude as long as nobody else is uncomfortable with it. And that goes for anyone in the home.  
Maybe allow sitting down to watch TV nude late at night? But that might be pushing it.

Does this sound alright from a Christian perspective? Or would this be too contradictory to practicing Christian modesty at home? What's the boundary between practicing good modesty and the home being a place where one can be more relaxed about things like how covered we are in certain contexts?",1,1770080733.0,ChristianParentAdvice,0,1.0,False

I try to make casual conversation, asking how his day was, what his favorite dish was at the restaurant, and if he had any plans over the weekend, etc. I guess this gave him the wrong impression, as he asked if I drink any coffee or tea. I told him yes, but I don’t have a special go-to spot. He responds, “That’s too bad, since I was gonna ask you out to coffee.” As a socially awkward person, I stuttered, “Haha, no, no, thank you…” He walks away, dejected, and I put on my earphones. A few minutes later, he came back saying he was just kidding and trying to continue the conversation. He even introduces me to the store owner, who gives me ice cream on the house for being a regular and promoting his store. 

The next day, I talked to my colleagues about this weird encounter since most of them go there as well. Turns out, one of my male colleagues had a weird experience with the same guy. He didn’t get into specifics, but said, “That dude ruined my lunch experience. He would not go away.” Another female colleague told me that when she was picking up her takeout, he noticed the same guy hovering over a table for young women. I felt even weirder, so I decided to call the store and speak with the owner. The owner was really apologetic and asked who the person was, but I didn't want to say who it was because I didn’t want him to lose his job over this. However, the owner was persistent, promising to keep me anonymous and to investigate the matter. I hesitated and gave him the name, but stressed that the guy didn’t say anything sexual and that I just wanted to go to the restaurant and enjoy my noodles. Plus, my workplace frequently orders from them, so we’d like to keep things as amicable as possible.

Later, I told one of my friends about what had happened, and he said I had “ruined this man’s life for reporting him.” Now I’m worried I did. But if this has been a recurring issue, wasn’t it right for me to say something? It’s up to the owner on what he does with the info. I never wanted to ruin his life. Just wanted the owner to talk to his staff about maintaining professionalism at the workplace.",0,1770080704.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

Ito yung bahagi ng programa na talagang inaabangan, dahil paulit ulit itong ipinapagawa ni Daniel Razon. Bakit nga ba hindi, mas madali naman talagang mag name that tune kaysa magturo ng Bible, magpatanong tungkol sa faith, o mangaral sa mga tao para mamulat sila sa katotohanan. Priorities matter.  
  
Sa halip na doctrinal discussion o open Q and A tungkol sa paniniwala, ang mga members ng MCGI ay binibigyan ng pagkakataong magpakitang gilas sa hulaan ng kanta. Entertaining, light, at walang masyadong isipin. Exactly what you need kapag ayaw mong ma stress sa malalalim na usaping espiritwal.  
  
Ang SKAP Serbisyong Kapatiran ang Pagsasanay ay ang weekly gameshow ng MCGI na ginaganap sa KDRAC or Kuya Daniel Razon Adventure Camp sa Bataan. Ang programa ay hino host ng most sensible preacher of our time na ngayon ay si Brother Daniel Razon, kasama ang kanyang wife na si Arlene Razon na siya ring may ari ng KDRAC.  
  
Regular na pinapapunta rito ang mga lokal members bilang contestants kasama ang kanilang supporters upang magsilbing live audience. Sa paligid ng venue ay makikita rin ang iba’t ibang negosyo nina Daniel at Arlene Razon tulad ng coffee shop, gas station, apparel store, hotel accommodations, camping sites, motorcycle rides, basketball court at airsoft games. Talagang kumpleto ang experience, mula spiritual hanggang recreational.  
  
And in many cases, members are then obliged to order food packs inside the adventure camp, bumili ng uniforms gaya ng polo shirt o jacket na may MCGI Cares logo, pati na rin ng iba’t ibang souvenirs na may KDRAC branding. Participation with benefits, kumbaga.  
  
Pero dito natin tinitingnan ang mas mahalagang tanong. If Daniel Razon is truly the messenger of God according to MCGI, bakit may oras para sa weekly gameshow pero tila wala para sa consistent Biblical preaching? Bakit hindi na nagpapatanong ang mga members tungkol sa pananampalataya pero may oras para sa Name That Tune at iba pang recreational activities sa KDRAC? At kung sugo nga siya ng Dios, hindi ba mas makabuluhan kung ipalabas worldwide ang SKAP para ipakita sa buong mundo ang karunungang inaangkin niya?  
  
Name that tune muna, aral mamaya. Or baka next week na lang ulit.

Hello, I'm looking for friends. I would prefer someone around my age or older.

I have social anxiety disorder and I find it very hard to even talk to strangers in public. I had only been going outside if I absolutely had to for years. I'm socially awkward but I have a good heart.

I don't really drink often, and I don't smoke or do drugs. I live in Parkdale, and I'm on ODSP, so I don't work.

I'm currently having a drink (ask me what! Tell me your bar order!) and watching a Netflix show (tell me what you're watching!)

I'll be the first to admit that my brain is weird and you might not like talking to me. I feel like the universe has been telling me to keep to myself or keep it simple, baby. So I'm trying to do that. To do whatever Netflix and chill meant before it meant ""Netflix and chill."" I'm deep, and maybe you'll get that. I'm willing to push that aside for some laid back chats tonight.

I love big - whiskey, coffee, reading, the way music affects my brain, pizza, natural water, lavender, camping, scary movies, dancing. And I don't hate - I feel like everything that hurts me is a lesson that I need to learn. I have a lot to say but also a lot of reservations so if I can't shut up about something, you've broken through that facade and cracked the code.

I have lots of regular interests and lots of niche ones. My life has been a long and strange journey. Let's talk about music and books, or hiking and sunsets, or cooking and baking. 

We'll have something to talk about if you've ever been an elder emo, loved Thai food, felt like music touches you differently than anyone else, cried over a book, or many other scenarios I can tell you via chat.

1qud595,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qud595/5_subtle_signs_someone_is_attracted_to_you/,5 Subtle Signs Someone Is ATTRACTED to You (Science-Based Signals Most People Miss),"Spent way too much time analyzing human behavior after realizing I'd missed every single hint someone threw my way. Turns out I'm not alone, most of us are terrible at reading attraction signals. So I dove deep into research, behavioral psychology books, body language studies, and yes, embarrassingly long YouTube rabbit holes about micro-expressions.



Here's what actually matters when someone's into you. Not the Hollywood stuff. The real, scientifically backed signals that fly under the radar.



\*\*Their pupils dilate when they look at you\*\*



This one's biology doing its thing. When we see something we like, our pupils expand without us even knowing. It's automatic, can't be faked. Next time you're talking to someone, watch their eyes in good lighting. If those pupils are bigger than normal, there's genuine interest happening.



Dr. Eckhard Hess studied this back in the 60s and found that pupil dilation is one of the most honest indicators of attraction. Your brain literally responds to attractive stimuli by letting more light in, like it wants to see more of what it likes.



\*\*They mirror your movements without realizing it\*\*



Called the chameleon effect in psychology. When someone's drawn to you, they subconsciously copy your body language. You lean in, they lean in. You touch your face, moments later they do too. It's like their body is trying to sync up with yours.



Picked this up from ""What Every BODY is Saying"" by Joe Navarro, ex-FBI agent who spent decades reading people. Insanely good read if you want to understand nonverbal communication. He breaks down how mirroring is our brain's way of building rapport with people we're attracted to or want to connect with. The book won't teach you manipulation tricks, it just makes you aware of what's already happening around you constantly.



\*\*They find excuses to be in your physical space\*\*



Not talking about obvious touching. More subtle. They'll position themselves near you in group settings. Choose the seat next to yours. ""Accidentally"" bump into you. Create reasons to hand you things so your fingers might touch.



Personal space violations only happen with people we're comfortable with or interested in. Everyone else? We maintain that invisible bubble. If you want to go deeper into understanding these patterns, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that pulls insights from relationship psychology books, research papers, and dating experts to create personalized audio content. You can tell it your specific goal, like ""understand attraction signals better"" or ""become more confident in dating,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan with podcasts you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The content connects insights from books like the ones mentioned here with real research on human behavior and attraction psychology.



\*\*Their voice changes when talking to you\*\*



Women's voices tend to get slightly higher and more animated. Men's voices often drop lower, become softer. Both genders tend to match their speaking pace to yours. It's primal stuff, we instinctively adjust our vocal patterns to appeal to people we're attracted to.



There's actual research on this, studies show that both men and women alter their pitch when speaking to attractive people versus same-sex friends. Your voice is doing flirting work before your brain even catches up.



\*\*They remember tiny details you mentioned once\*\*



Someone who's attracted to you is paying ATTENTION. Like, intense focus. You mentioned your favorite coffee order three weeks ago in passing? They remember. Brought up that random podcast episode? They went and listened to it.



""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer breaks this down perfectly. He's another ex-FBI guy who studied how to build rapport and read interest signals. The book's core idea is that we invest mental energy into people we're drawn to. We remember details, ask follow up questions later, bring up inside jokes. This is the best social dynamics book I've ever read, makes you question everything you thought you knew about human connection.



The Finch app actually helped me practice being more present in conversations, which made me better at noticing when others were doing this with me. It's a self-care app with a cute bird companion, sounds silly but the daily check-ins trained me to be more mindful of my interactions and emotional patterns.



Thing is, attraction isn't always this big obvious thing. Most real interest shows up in these micro-moments that last seconds. We miss them because we're in our heads, overthinking, or waiting for some dramatic movie moment that rarely happens.



Human behavior is messy and complicated. Biology, psychology, past experiences, all mixing together. These signs aren't foolproof, context always matters. But they're way more reliable than waiting for someone to literally spell it out for you.



Pay attention to the small stuff. That's where the truth lives.",1,1770079119.0,BuildToAttract,1,1.0,False

1qud0kk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0aomKJWI_c,Jampack po tayo ngayon sa KDRAC Sabi ni Mon Jocson,"""Jampack po tayo ngayon” yan ang masiglang anunsyo ni Mon Jocson habang ipinapakita ang KDRAC Adventure Camp nina Daniel at Arlene Razon. Talagang jampack, kumbaga punong puno, halos hindi na magkandaugaga ang dami ng tao. At least yun ang sinasabi.  
  
Muling napuno ang KDRAC dahil sa pagdating ng mga delegates mula sa iba’t ibang lokal ng MCGI. Sa mga nakaraang linggo ay napansin naman ng marami na tila humihina ang bilang ng pumupunta sa KDRAC, kaya ngayon ay nadagdagan ang target audience. Sa tulong ng mga MCGI Church workers, inimbitahan na rin ang mga tinaguriang madadalang members, ayon sa direktiba ni Arlene Razon na siyang may ari ng KDRAC. Team effort ika nga.  
  
Kasabay nito, naglabasan ang iba’t ibang pakulo ni Daniel Razon sa loob ng KDRAC. May flying lantern ceremony na diumano’y sumisimbolo na siya raw bilang sugo ng Dios ay nagliliwanag o pinagmumulan ng liwanag. Mayroon ding paper boat ceremony kung saan isusulat mo ang iyong wish sa papel at palulutangin ito sa waters ng KDRAC. Very spiritual. Very symbolic. Very creative.  
  
Ang SKAP Serbisyong Kapatiran ang Pagsasanay ay ang weekly gameshow ng MCGI na regular na ginaganap sa KDRAC or Kuya Daniel Razon Adventure Camp sa Bataan. Ang programa ay hino host ng most sensible preacher of our time na ngayon ay si Brother Daniel Razon, kasama ang kanyang wife na si Arlene Razon na siya ring may ari ng buong adventure camp.  
  
Dito ay palaging pinapapunta ang mga lokal members bilang participants kasama ang kanilang supporters upang magsilbing live audience. Sa paligid ng venue, nariyan din ang iba pang negosyo nina Daniel at Arlene Razon tulad ng coffee shop, gas station, apparel store, hotel accommodations, camping sites, motorcycle rides, basketball court at airsoft games. Isang kumpletong experience na pwede mong sabihing spiritual at commercial in one place.  
  
And in many cases, members are then obliged to order food packs inside the camp, bumili ng uniforms gaya ng polo shirt o jacket na may MCGI Cares logo, at siyempre mga souvenirs na may KDRAC branding. Supporting the work never looked this organized.  
  
Pero dito pumapasok ang mas seryosong tanong. If Daniel Razon is truly the messenger of God according to MCGI, bakit may oras para sa weekly gameshow pero tila wala para sa consistent Biblical preaching? Bakit hindi na nagpapatanong sa mga members pero may oras para sa recreational activities sa KDRAC? At kung sugo nga siya ng Dios, hindi ba mas makabuluhan kung ipalabas worldwide ang SKAP para maipakita sa buong mundo ang karunungang inaangkin niya?

1quczjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1quczjo/too_afraid_to_try_again/,Too afraid to try again,"Hello everyone. 
Please be kind to me. I just want to learn new outlooks on my current situation. Don't judge me.

It's always been hard for me to find a partner. I live in a very small town where everybody is already committed to someone or not willing to build something serious. And I've seen it's not depending on the age.

I first tried to know a gay guy back when I was 19, now I'm 26. This guy was very sweet and kind to me, but 3 weeks later he told me that he had a boyfriend. So everything finished.
When I was 20, I dated a guy for a month. It was amazing, he was caring, always texting me. Until a day when he told me ""the truth is, I've already got a relationship, but I had this strong fantasy about you and I had to fulfill it"". 
So it didn't work, as you can imagine.
Then university kept me busy till I was 24, and then I downloaded dating apps.
And it never worked out. It's true, I live in a small community, but
- many people block even before meeting
- some think you're not enough for them
- some just look for sex
- that's where I met my ex who dumped me telling he never actually liked me, but he gave me a chance because I own a master's degree.
On other social media, the locals are already in a relationship but they never show it, so if you text them, even only for a friendship (it's a lonely place to be and I have no gay friends here), they stop you telling they're already committed to someone else (only to send their hot pics later, yes, it happened).

Now, I've been exchanging some messages with an interesting guy lately. We don't talk every day, but it came out that we share some common interests. He also seems to be kinda sweet and kind, and also cute, and I'd like to ask him out to drink a coffee together. 
But I'm too afraid to do that. I don't wanna look like the desperately lonely guy, and also I don't wanna go where I am not supposed to be. He's considered a very cool guy, whereas I'm just an ordinary and boring gay that no one has real interest in. So if someone is at a higher level than me, I don't wanna even try something that would humiliate me. 

I was just thinking to give it up. I don't need him after all. I don't even know him. And I think he's already in a relationship: there's always someone taking pics of him, he travels, goes on hikes etc. And he's surely not alone. But he never tags the people with him, so I assume he's with his boyfriend. 
Another friend of mine told me to invite him for a coffee, because he's a cute and good guy. Should I protect myself thereby listening to what my mind suggests me to do, or should I listen to my friend?
Being rejected feels bad. And I've been rejected so many times in my short life. I always try to be at my best, take care of myself etc.. but people don't even notice it. Sometimes some tell me I'm very handsome and interesting and well-educated, but my permanent loneliness makes me doubt it.
And I really don't wanna be rejected again. It damages my already low self value. 
I also went to therapy for my unbalanced love life and for my self-esteem, but I'm still working on the thing.",4,1770078718.0,GayMen,1,1.0,False

His hand drifted to his pocket before he could stop it.

Greg’s name sat on the screen. One tap and he could be done with this. Sick. Family thing. Anything. Henry could take the shift. Greg would forgive him.

His thumb hovered until the screen dimmed. He let it. He set the phone face-down on the end table like it might start talking back.

Coffee, again. He filled the kettle without thinking, flicked it on, and watched the little red light come alive. Steam threaded up in sharp, thin strands—couldn’t touch the bleach smell that still lived in his nose.

The scent had burned itself into him months ago.

He took his mug to the couch and picked up his Bible. The leather was worn where his thumb always landed. He didn’t mean to open there.

Philippians 2.

Count others more significant than yourselves.

He read the line once, then again, slower. 

Austin blinked hard. His eyes dropped back to the text like it could save him.

Christ emptied himself… made himself nothing.

Austin swallowed. The guilt hadn’t dulled. The sense of being watched hadn’t either. Some days it felt like the building had gotten inside him and stayed.

He saw the woman from the parking lot again: eyes sliding past him like he wasn’t there. Someone already halfway gone.

He didn’t know what you did with people like that. He didn’t know what you did with yourself.

The steam thinned. The room settled back into its corners.

He whispered a prayer that broke apart halfway through. Just breath in the quiet.

When he woke, the mug was cold beside him and rain ticked at the window in steady knuckles. His neck ached. He pulled the blanket tighter and tried to convince himself to go to bed like a normal person.

Tomorrow he’d be back inside those walls.

Morning came gray and heavy. He packed with too much care—folded shirts, checked his phone, checked it again—waiting for Greg to call and release him.

No missed calls.

By late afternoon the clouds had sunk low enough to feel like a ceiling. The TV murmured local news and ads, filling the apartment with other people’s emergencies.

The clock on the wall read 5:07 by the time Austin finished the laundry.

Austin’s stomach dipped.

Six.

He started gathering his things with the wrong kind of calm—folding, zipping, checking pockets—like speed would come from doing it right.

He shouldered his bag and stepped out.

The stairwell smelled of dust and damp fabric, the air already heavy with the coming storm. Austin stepped out into the wind. Clouds knotted black overhead, and the first drops of rain scattered like spit against his face.

The corner place two blocks from his apartment glowed a sickly yellow through the glass. The bell over the door gave a tired jingle when he stepped inside.

A radio behind the counter crackled through a weather alert—storm warning extended, stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary.

“Evenin’. Heads up, we’re closing in a few—gotta get out of here before the snow starts,” the clerk muttered, looking up.

Austin grabbed chips, granola bars, a couple bottles of soda. His hand hovered over the powdered donuts—the ones he used to bring Darrick—then he pulled it back and moved on.

At the counter, a stack of newspapers lay half-unwrapped. A black-and-white photo stared up at him: the mouth of a stairwell, police tape sagging across the opening.

The headline read: LOCAL MAN PULLED FROM UNDERPASS STAIRWELL AFTER SUSPECTED DRUG ACTIVITY.

Austin slid his snacks onto the counter. His eyes stayed on the picture as the clerk rang him up.

The article was short—two narrow columns under the photo:

“Witnesses reported seeing the man descend into the underpass shortly after midnight. Emergency crews later found him facedown at the bottom landing of the stairwell, wedged against the concrete wall where the melted snow pooled and refroze. Clothing was discarded several yards away. Paramedics described his skin as ‘rigid with cold,’ with fingertips blackened to the knuckle and lips too swollen to form a full sentence.”

“Unhoused male in his forties,” the article noted. Condition was unknown.

There was no name.

But Austin knew the face from the grainy zoom of the photo. The angle was bad—but he’d seen those eyes at the mission desk.

Reggie. The guy who always asked if the mission would ever loosen up about policy. The one who’d laughed it off the last time Austin put him out for coming in smelling like weed and booze.

The article went on: “Police noted the incident could be related to recent reports of missing unhoused individuals in the area.”

People walked over that underpass every day. Cars rolled above it without slowing. A man could go down there and the city would keep moving.

“You want a paper with that?” the clerk asked.

Austin realized he’d been staring. “No,” he said quickly. “Just this.”

The clerk shoved the snacks into a thin plastic bag. “Crazy, huh?” he said, nodding toward the paper. “Storm’s not even here yet and people already out there dying for nothing.”

Austin swiped his card. His throat felt tight. “It’s sad.” he managed.

He took the bag and stepped back out into the cold. The door shut behind him with a hollow jingle.

For a second he just stood there on the sidewalk. He pictured Reggie being dragged out of the stairwell— another man the city would forget by next week. 

He thought of the men who joked and complained and pushed boundaries. Men who, given the wrong night and the wrong choice could end up on that front page as “unhoused male, condition unknown.”

He checked his phone. 5:47.

Austin stopped walking.

He hadn’t realized how long he’d been standing there.

Two missed calls. One voicemail. From Greg.

Greg’s voice came through thin and clipped: “Austin—just a reminder. Need you here by six. Once we lock, we don’t reopen. Call me when you’re on your way.”

Austin shoved the phone in his pocket, pulled his coat tight, and hurried toward the mission.

The streets were dead. Lamps cast an orange tint over the freezing pavement. Austin’s socks squished with every step inside his boots. A few more blocks away, the mission rose from the dark like a block of stone, its windows casting a dim light that stretched shadows across the parking lot.

The fastest way was under that overpass. Austin took it without thinking—head down, shoulders up, moving like a man trying to beat weather and guilt at the same time.

The stairwell dropped between the concrete walls like a throat.

He slowed, just enough to look.

A figure sat on the first step, half-curled under a hood, rocking like the cold had a rhythm. Breath puffed out in thin, ruined bursts. One hand kept worrying about something in a pocket—keys, maybe, or nothing at all.

“You okay?” Austin called, voice absorbing into the concrete.

The figure lifted their head.

“I’m fine,” the man said quickly. Too quick. “Just… tired.”

Austin’s phone went off—one hard vibration like a warning. He checked without meaning to.

5:53.

“I can call someone,” Austin said, and hated how automatic it sounded. 

The man let out a small laugh that scraped on the way out. “Yeah. Everybody’s got a number.” His gaze slid up the street. “Go on. You got somewhere you gotta be.”

Austin stood there—one step from going down, one step from going on—until the wind shoved sleet sideways into his face and made the decision for him.

He backed away. “Don’t go down there,” the man said—hating how small it sounded. A rule disguised as help.

Austin turned and hurried on.

He slowed as he approached the mission. The closer he came, the more the place seemed to draw breath—the gutters moaning, the air tugging at his coat. Rain hit harder, pinning him toward the door like invisible hands pressing at his back.

Austin paused at the threshold. The glass panes reflected him dimly—hollow eyes, shoulders bent, a shape he barely recognized. 

The handle was slick with rain, cold as bone.

Inside, the heat struck first. The foyer smelled of disinfectant and wet coats. Fluorescents sung overhead once again, their glow shallow, failing to reach the corners.

The door shut behind him with a deep clap, muting the storm.

The clock above the entrance read 5:58.

Austin’s lungs loosened like he’d done something righteous.

He pulled his coat tighter, forced his boots forward. The building seemed to drink the sound of each step.

He was back inside.

Pastor Greg waited in the check-in office, sleeves rolled, clipboard in hand. A few men lingered in the lobby, watching the door like it might decide to lock early.

As Austin approached, one of the regulars rolled his eyes and threw his hands up.

“We got you for the storm?!” Gerald Hattly barked. “Ah man, we’re dead.”

“Good evening to you too, Gerald,” Austin said, stepping past him, cold as the air he’d just walked in from.

Gerald was the mission’s permanent complaint—always biting the hand that fed him, never grateful enough to stop coming back.

Austin felt the room’s attention settle on him like a weight—waiting to see if he’d argue, joke, or crack. He chose none of it and went straight to the check-in desk.

“Evening Austin. Just in time.” Greg shoved the clipboard into his hands without looking up. The roster was clipped a little crooked, like somebody had reattached it in a hurry.

A sticky note was slapped under the clip—old, wrinkled, written in Greg’s blocky pen:

DON’T LEAVE THEM ALONE.

IF IT GETS NICE, DON’T SIT.

DON’T WRITE NEW NAMES.

Austin’s brow pinched. “New names?”

Greg’s eyes flicked to the note like he didn’t want to acknowledge it existed.

“Just—don’t,” he said. Then, quieter: “Trust me.”

“This is the schedule for the stay,” Greg added, tapping the top page like it was the only thing Austin should be reading. “Meal times, devotional slots, wake-up, lights-out. On the last day, once the snow starts to clear, we’ll have the guests do a deep clean of the day room and bathrooms. Everything else is in there.”

“Do I have a list of all the guests?”

“Yeah, right under here.” Greg flipped the top page, revealing another beneath. “Everyone’s already checked in for the night. Whoever’s on that sheet is who you’ve got for the storm. No more, no less.”

“Looks light,” Austin said. “How many’s that—twenty-three?”

Names like Marcus and Gerald stood out in ink that already felt too permanent. Then his eyes snagged on one that froze him in place.

Will Cramer.

Through the office window, he could see the edge of the day room. Will sat along the wall in one of the cheap green pleather chairs, his cane planted between his shoes. Even from here, Austin could see the tremor in his fingers where the rested on the handle.

For a split second, Will glanced toward the office, like he could feel someone watching him. Their eyes didn’t quite meet. Austin dropped his gaze back to the clipboard first.

“Need anything else before I head home?” Greg asked.

“No. Let me walk you out.”

Austin clung to Greg’s presence as they moved through the hall, making a quick stop to drop his bag in Greg’s office. The door to that room—his room now—felt heavier than it should.

“Austin, seriously, thank you for doing this,” Greg said as they reached the front. “It’ll be over before you know it, and remember—if you need anything, I’m a phone call away.”

Austin held the door as Greg buttoned his coat. Snow spiraled down in slow, heavy flakes, the streetlamps already haloed in white.

“Looks like the snow’s starting,” Austin said. His breath fogged in the cold air. “You be safe, Pastor Greg.”

Greg clapped his shoulder. “You got it. See you in a few days. And Austin—thank you. Seriously. This place is in good hands.”

Austin nodded but didn’t trust himself to answer.

Greg stepped out, boots crunching over the thin frost. He gave a quick wave before turning toward his car, the flakes swallowing him step by step.

Austin slid his key in from the outside and twisted. The sound echoed too loudly in the empty foyer. Then the door closed behind him with a hollow thud. For a moment, he just stood there, coat still on, bag at his feet, listening.

The building creaked against the wind. The fluorescents hummed once again above him.

He thought of the verse from the night before—count others more significant than yourselves. The words pulsed in him like the heartbeat he’d laid his palm over.

Twenty-three names on a sheet of paper.

No one shoved back out into the cold. No one freezing under a bridge because of him.

In the quiet, the mission made the smallest sound—almost polite.

A chair leg ticked somewhere down the hall.

Just enough to make Austin turn his head.

The storm pressed at the windows, and the mission seemed to press back.

The next few days were already closing around him.",1,1770078359.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qucr5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1qucr5d/that_solo_trip_i_was_dreading_turned_out_to_be/,That solo trip I was dreading turned out to be surprisingly easy and affordable: (Spent 2 weeks exploring Portugal for under $1200) 🌍,"Honestly, I was dreading my first solo trip. Visions of expensive hotels, lonely meals, and getting totally lost in a foreign country haunted me. For years, the idea of ""solo travel"" felt like something only fearless, wealthy people did. But then I finally bit the bullet and booked a two-week trip to Portugal, and let me tell you, I was wrong about pretty much everything. It was surprisingly easy, incredibly welcoming, and yes, genuinely affordable.

I just got back from exploring Portugal for **under $1200** for two full weeks (not including flights, but seriously, the in-country costs were a shock). This wasn't a budget-killing, ramen-only kind of trip either. I ate well, saw amazing things, and even treated myself to a few nicer experiences.

Here's a quick breakdown of how it worked out:

*   **Total Duration:** 14 days
*   **My In-Country Spend:** Roughly **$1150** (spread out for 14 nights/14 days)

*   **Destinations & Flow:**
    *   **Lisbon (5 days):** Arrived, got my bearings. Explored Alfama, Bairro Alto, Belém. Took a day trip to **Sintra** for Pena Palace and Quinta da Regaleira (get there early!).
    *   **Coimbra (2 days):** A charming university town, much calmer than Lisbon. The Joanina Library is a must-see.
    *   **Porto (5 days):** Explored the Ribeira district, crossed the Dom Luís I bridge, did a port wine tasting. Absolutely loved the vibe here.
    *   **Aveiro/Costa Nova (Day Trip from Porto):** A quick train ride to see the colourful striped houses and take a moliceiro boat ride.
    *   **Return to Lisbon (2 days):** Before my flight home, mostly for souvenirs and re-visiting favourite spots.

*   **Budget Breakdown (Approximate):**
    *   **Accommodation ($400):** Mostly hostels (clean, social, often with breakfast included). I opted for private rooms for about half the nights ($30-40/night) and dorms for the other half ($15-20/night). Staying in places with kitchens saved a ton on food.
    *   **Food & Drinks ($350):** This included daily coffee and pastries, *prato do dia* (dish of the day) lunches for €8-12, groceries from local markets for self-cooked dinners, and a few fancier dinners with wine. You can eat *really* well and cheap in Portugal if you stick to local spots and avoid tourist traps.
    *   **Transportation ($200):** Viva Viagem card for Lisbon metro/trams, train tickets between cities (Lisbon-Coimbra-Porto-Lisbon) booked a bit in advance for better prices, and a few Ubers when tired. Portugal's public transport is excellent.
    *   **Activities & Sightseeing ($150):** Entrance fees for Sintra palaces, a couple of museums, a port wine tasting, walking tours (free, just tip your guide). Many beautiful sights are free to just wander through!
    *   **Miscellaneous/Buffer ($50):** Souvenirs, an emergency snack, a spontaneous gelato.

**Real Talk:**

*   **The ""Lonely"" Myth:** I was genuinely worried about eating alone or feeling isolated. The reality? Hostels are buzzing with other solo travellers. I met people from all over the world at breakfast, on walking tours, and even sharing a table at a cafe. Solo dining felt less awkward than I imagined, especially with a book or just people-watching.
*   **Navigation:** Initial nerves about figuring out public transport faded quickly. Google Maps and Citymapper were lifesavers, and the locals, even with a language barrier, were incredibly helpful and patient.
*   **The Food Surprise:** I knew Portuguese food was good, but the sheer quality and affordability of simple, honest meals blew me away. Fresh seafood, delicious pastries (hello, *pastel de nata*!), and excellent local wine at prices that felt like a steal.
*   **Unexpected Challenge:** Packing light for 2 weeks in a backpack was tougher than I thought, especially with varying temperatures between cities. Next time, I'm bringing even fewer ""just in case"" items.
*   **The Best Discovery:** The freedom to change my plans on a whim. If I loved a neighbourhood, I could stay longer. If I was tired, I could just chill. No compromises, no debates, just pure personal exploration.

1qucqp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCDpartners/comments/1qucqp6/about_to_take_a_break_help/,About to take a break... help?,"Hey. I (25F) have been in a relationship with my ROCD partner (29M) for the past 13 months, and recently it's just gotten so hard for me that I've just called him to say that if things don't feel any lighter within the next two weeks, we're going to take a 3 month break -- I need it to clear my head, and he's been saying it might help him properly ""click"" whether he really wants this or not. I am feeling a little conflicted about this choice though, and I need some advice from people who have been through similar.

So a somewhat abridged background to the relationship... we met through moving in the same circles, had a little moment together a few years ago where most normal people would have gone ""let's get coffee about it"" and instead I (anxious, CSA history) avoided him for the next 2 years. After that, our friend group interactions became regular enough that I started to pick up a vibe that he might still be interested, so I asked him out for coffee -- we seemed super compatible to me, and I didn't want to waste that again.

We got coffee a couple times, then he freaked out and said he didn't think he was ready. I said okay, let's stay friends? Proceed 1-year-long situationship where every time we started to hang out consistently again, I'd ask if maybe there was something there, and he's freak out again. To me it seemed like he was super keen, just shy and possibly intimidated. He'd get visibly upset when he saw me talking to the other guys who were showing interest, but not do anything about it.

Fast forward to NYE 2025 and he got it in his head that if he didn't do something asap, he'd lose me (I was willing to wait a little longer, I liked him a lot), so he asked me out. Relationship seemed perfect (to me) for months, then first hit -- I found out he'd been going to his mom pretty regularly to bounce my perceived flaws/mistakes off her -- one major one being he ""wasn't sure if I was a good woman"" because I was too casual talking about sex (I gave him my history of CSA and healing after that and he apologised). It broke me -- I felt like it was a huge breach of trust since he hadn't communicated anything.

Similar incidents followed -- we'd settle again, and everything would be fine (to me and everyone watching at least), I'd just be slightly more careful this time. And then something would happen -- someone would mention marriage, or we'd have a disagreement, and then he'd suddenly get cold and distant. If I asked what was up, it was always one of his first things: ""I love you, I just don't know if I'm in love with you.""

He's said a few things that have really eroded me over this time. Like, once, ""I'm worried since I didn't chase you to begin with, one day I'll wake up ready to chase someone and it won't be you"", or after some banter with a friend or a political conversation it'll be ""I worry you're actually mean"" or ""I can't keep up with the political stuff, so that must make us incompatible"". I feel like I've continually been shrinking myself to fit his narrative of what might make a good woman, but he doesn't even know himself. 

And every time we have these talks or little breakdowns, he always says ""I'm stressed ALL THE TIME -- you just don't see it"". I don't know what to do with that. I don't know how to help, because he won't communicate in the moment, so I feel like I'm always second guessing now.

Recently, my dad asked if we've had the marriage talk yet. There's no pressure from anyone for us to get married anytime soon, and my parents love him a lot, they're just worried I'll waste my prime years on someone who might not be that serious about me. I brought that up to him, and he said he'd ""think about it"", then the next day it was just the doubts and what-ifs again. We debriefed about it further the next day and he said he probably has ROCD, so we looked into it together and it sounds right.

The relationship has been a lot of fun and I've learned a lot about myself through him. He can be really sweet, but other times often when I need him the most, he's cold and it's like he sees straight through me. I've been really patient with him up to this point and it almost feels wrong to be thinking ""I can't do this anymore"" right as we start talking about concrete treatment plans together. It's just it's so hard seeing him look at me and knowing no matter what I do, I'm not enough in his mind -- and knowing he's having all these thoughts and hasn't once tried to stand up for me to himself.

So I've compromised and we're taking a break. My question is, with all said and done, would it actually be better for me to be around when he's working on all this? How do I know he isn't just going to spiral worse and then disappear from my life completely -- and maybe unnecessarily?",2,1770078114.0,ROCDpartners,0,1.0,False

actually doing it

they've been brown since april

i water them every sunday

the trick is if you maintain the routine no one asks when it died

my neighbor waves

comments on my garden

i smile

the dirt is full of corpses

we're both pretending

i think that's most of what living is

the conspiracy of not saying it out loud

she tells me about her promotion

her eyes don't match her mouth

i congratulate her

we both know she's describing a prettier cage

she'll realize it in six months

i'm not going to tell her

watching people figure it out themselves is better

you can see the exact moment the light dies

i have a folder on my phone

screenshots of conversations

just before people ghost

the last normal message before the silence

i study them

trying to find what i missed

but i didn't miss anything

people just do this

they decide you're done and they don't tell you

one day you matter

the next day you're a notification they swipe away

no announcement

no closure

just absence

and we all do it to each other

and we all pretend we don't

my therapist asked what i'm afraid of

i said ""nothing""

she wrote something down

i'm afraid that the version of me in other people's heads is already dead

and i'm just a ghost they haven't noticed yet

but that's not the kind of thing you tell therapists

they have protocols for that

the group chat hasn't had a real message in months

just memes

reaction emojis

the occasional ""lol""

we're all in there

none of us are leaving

leaving would mean admitting it's over

so we haunt it

digital zombies

performing friendship for an audience of other performers

i know things about people they don't know i know

the internet leaves trails

that person who said they were too busy to hang out

posted stories at a party the same night

i didn't say anything

i never say anything

i just file it away

the collection of small murders

the proof that i'm optional

everyone's doing this

everyone has a mental list of times they didn't matter as much as they thought

we just don't compare notes

my brother calls once a month

same day

same time

same duration

it's on his calendar

i can tell because it's too consistent

scheduled affection

maintenance calls

like checking the oil in a car you don't really drive

i don't tell him i know

that would make it awkward

we need the illusion more than the truth

at the wedding i watched everyone

the bride's smile went dead between photos

just for a second

no one else caught it

the groom checked his phone during the vows

two seconds

face down angle

but i saw

they'll be fine probably

fine is what we call it when you stop expecting better

give them four years

i've started lying about being busy

not because i am

because saying ""i don't want to"" makes people uncomfortable

so i invent obligations

and people believe them

because they're also inventing obligations

we're all building elaborate excuses to avoid each other

while claiming we wish we hung out more

the system runs on manufactured scarcity

we're all complicit

there's a version of me in everyone's head

and they're all different

and they're all wrong

but correcting them would require explaining

and explaining would require them caring enough to listen

they don't

i don't blame them

i don't care enough to listen either

we're all just trading approximations

hoping no one looks too close

the coffee shop girl knows my order

she doesn't know my name

i've been coming here for two years

that's the relationship

transaction memory

just enough recognition to feel seen

not enough to actually be known

i prefer it honestly

real knowing requires maintenance

and i'm tired

i can tell when people are about to ask if i'm okay

their face does a thing

concern performance

準備された empathy

i head it off

make a joke

redirect

because if i say ""no actually i'm not okay""

they'll have to do something

and they don't want to do something

they want me to say ""yeah just tired""

so i do

we both get what we need

the dance continues

my mom sends articles about things she thinks i'd like

she's building a version of me from search results

i read them

i don't correct her

the real me would disappoint her

the article me is better

more coherent

easier to love

i'm doing her a favor

everyone's doing everyone a favor

by not being honest

by not asking real questions

by not showing the actual thing

we've agreed collectively

that performance is kindness

that distance is respect

that slow mutual abandonment is just life

and it works

until you're alone at 3am

and you realize you haven't had a real conversation in months

but by morning you'll forget again

and the performance continues

i watched a friendship die yesterday

in real time

over coffee

we both knew

neither of us said it

we just talked about surface things

made vague plans we'd never keep

hugged goodbye

that was the last time

we both know it

the ending happened silently

between the words

in the things we didn't say

this is how everything ends

not with honesty

not with conflict

just with

slow

mutual

retreat

until one day you realize

you don't know anyone

and no one knows you

and you all chose this

together

separately

the conspiracy of not looking too close

not asking too much

not being too real

we're all keeping each other at arm's length

calling it boundaries

calling it self care

calling it healthy

really it's just cowardice

the fear of being seen

the fear of seeing

so we stay surface

we stay safe

we stay alone

and we pretend this is living

when really

we're all just

waiting

for something

nothing

the end

whatever comes first

1qucoi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1qucoi5/moisture_loss_low_problem/,Moisture loss low - problem?,"My roasts on my SR800 are acceptable - but also I'm self taught so I'm sure sure if I'm doing something wrong.

My concern is that my mosture losses are quite low compared to what my sweet Maria card suggests.

My minimum was 10.1% moisture loss, most are in the 12% range, two hit 13.7% and one went to 18.4% (which was a burnt batch - semi on purpose)

So the card is suggesting that means my roasts are mostly city- to city, with two getting to city+ and one going off the charts.

I'm aiming for full city + almost exclusively.

From color - they all have been ranging around city+ to full city+, but honestly almost all were right at the edge between full city and full city+.

I don't know if be able to tell by taste what is a light/medium roast, but I prefer medium roasts normally. I've been categorizing them as medium mostly.

Right now I'm roasting through 1lb samples, so I don't often compare the same beans batch to batch.

So..........what could be going on?

* Is the moisture loss lieing to me? (Or unimportant?)
* Am I likely screwing up the roasting process where not enough moisture is leaving?
* Are my eyes not seeing the right colors?
* Do I live in a mini parallel universe where the moisture loss on coffee is just slightly skewed?

The place was packed, and everyone was clearly annoyed.

While waiting, I noticed an elderly man arguing quietly with the cashier. He was short a few dollars and kept apologizing, saying he must have miscounted. The line behind him was getting restless.

Without really thinking about it, I stepped forward, paid for his coffee, and told him it was no big deal.

He looked genuinely shocked. He thanked me several times and said, “I hope someone does the same for you when you need it.”

That was it. We never exchanged names. I went to work and forgot about it.

A few months later, I was laid off unexpectedly. Rent was due, my savings were thin, and I was quietly panicking. One afternoon, I went to a job interview I felt wildly underqualified for.

The interviewer looked at my resume, paused, and smiled. He said, “This might sound strange, but have you ever bought coffee for a confused old man?”

It was him. Same man from the café.

He didn’t hire me out of gratitude. He said my resume was solid. But he admitted that moment stuck with him, and it told him more about me than any cover letter ever could.

I got the job. It changed everything — my career, my confidence, my life.

1qucnmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/crt/comments/1qucnmx/roku_vs_fire_stick/,Roku VS Fire Stick,"I've been casually googling what the easiest, but higher quality option would be on a older composite CRT 

First thing I've gathered is that there's a Roku 2000 something and 3000 series that's still outputs composite and receives updates though the 2000 series from what I read is so slow that it's not even worth using 

The 3000 series is over $100 on eBay and most of the Facebook marketplace listings they don't mention which model it is 

YouTube is full of people just buying the cheapest Roku with the cheapest HDMI-COMP adapter and running the video in a weird 16x9 letterbox 

I did see a video where a guy mentioned you can go into the Roku settings and change it to 480p which helps scale it better but I couldn't find anything else about that 

Then I started to wonder if maybe the fire stick has similar settings that allow better scaling but I couldn't really find anything 

Another post I saw mentioned an HDMI-COAX adapter for about $50 that lets you zoom the picture in manually which is a feature I've not seen on these cheaper converters 

Just curious what anyone else has to say :)

1qucnbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldantlercritics/comments/1qucnbf/feb_farm_update_incoherent_transcript/,Feb farm update - incoherent transcript,"Hey, everybody, it's your good friend Jenna, and I am back with another podcast, the February farm update here at Cold Antler Farm. This is usually a private podcast that goes out to paying subscribers where I talk about what's going on with the farm, farm life, the animals. my personal life and everyday operations. However,

recently there's been a whole influx of new subscribers and I didn't want your first email from me to be something that was behind a paywall. So this is once again going out to everyone in the community and for anyone interested, it's been cold. It's been so cold. I apologize if I sound congested. We got hit with this

Deep freeze a couple weeks before Christmas, which is not normal for up here. I live in upstate New York. It's not any stranger to winter. However, usually true cold, true winter doesn't hit until after the holidays. Like you might get some snow. You might get one storm.

Some days might dip around the single digits, but it's not the consistent weather. Arctic air, like days never going above the teens, nights going well below zero, sometimes in the double digits below zero, which people are used to. People all over America live with that kind of cold.

But most people that live with that kind of cold live with... Modern heating equipment. They have like, oh, not to interrupt, but a beautiful and gorgeous chipping sparrow, which I haven't seen in a while, just came to the feeder. These are sparrows that look, they have like a real red crown and white wingtips.

Sorry, I'm easily distracted by birds. You're going to have to get used to it. I will turn around so I can actually talk to you about the farm. So it's been cold. It's been cold. And this house is heated. This is the house with electricity. I am talking to you on a cell phone. However...

I'm recording into my iPhone 8S, which, by the way, just became a vintage model. I need to upgrade to a 10 if I want to download and upgrade my apps. So I'm getting distracted. It's cold. And here in this life of limited technology, I mostly heat with firewood. And I've already gone through three cords of wood.

I usually go through four winter. This year, things were really tight in the fall, and I couldn't afford to buy four cords up front. So as my wood supplies had been dwindling down, I had to order more. And it just got delivered Saturday, I believe.

Saturday, I got a delivery with a pickup truck of hay bales and a trailer of firewood. It came from my wood guy. He's a great guy. And he told me before I bought it that this was wood that has been out. It's been cut, it's dry, but it's been out. It's been in the elements.

So what that means is that it will not be like ideal for heating the house. It's got a couple days. The wood's already dried, but it's been out in the snow. Like it's been and the only thing protecting it was the wood that was stacked on top of it is my understanding.

If I'm not right, I mean no disrespect to the wood guy. But he told me this wood is damp. It's not ideal for heating. Are you sure you want to buy it from me? And my brain was like, I got to get wood delivered no matter what this guy I can afford.

If it means I have to bring it into cure by the stove for a day or two before I use it for burning. I have enough wood left over from like, you know, I have a couple days of just super dry firewood still stored up. I'm not entirely out. So I said, yes, bring it.

The wood is as he described. It's cold. It's got snow on it. It's got frost. It's got some ice on it. And it is thawing out a day or two in advance. So there's like these little stacks of wood by the fire drying next to the wood that's been dried from the day before.

It's a system, but I'm warm is what I'm saying. As cold as it's been outside this last stretch. And for those, there's people have been listening to me talk about winters here for well over a decade. Some of you have been listening to me or reading about my life for 20 years now.

And you remember the years of just burst pipes and such panic and learning how to live. And a house that was built in 1860, more like the people who lived here in 1860, as opposed to who lived here in modern times. And that means heating with fire. And I'm heating with fire with also modern plumbing.

So I had to learn how to keep that warm and keep that insulated. And a house that is very old fashioned. So all my plumbing, this house doesn't have water going up and down floors and stairs. There's a water tank in the basement. And that basement tank has to pump from the basement to my kitchen.

bathroom, which are side by side. And that's the entire water system in this house. There are no pipes going upstairs. There's no upstairs bathrooms. The entire plumbing industry in my house is in a 10-foot radius. So ideally, it's like, okay, that's easy to keep warm. Just keep that area warm and there'll be no issues.

However, that 10-square-foot radius is mostly located under the crawl space of a house that is always susceptible to outdoor temperatures. So those pipes have to be insulated. They have burst in years where I didn't know about these things. When a bathroom floor got flooded and we had to rebuild it with me and some friends,

we went in and put some more insulation around pipes that were the farthest from the house. And so every year, things have been getting a little better. This year, I took an old wool runner rug, like one of those wool braided rugs, but They're like super thick. They're old school.

It's maybe like eight feet long and two feet wide. I made a literal, not a blanket, but like a wall around the plumbing of wool so that any wind coming into the crawl space from God knows where... can be kind of thwarted. And I've wrapped the pipes in old fleeces and old blankets. And it's been helping.

It's been, mornings here have been anywhere from negative 10 to zero degrees now. for the past at least 10 days to two weeks. And we had one day, I had one day where the pipes froze. And since then, I've been keeping all the water running.

There's, I mean, for me to have a warm house and hot and cold water on tap, I'm pretty set. my oven works thrilled. I did I had my oven die in the summer. And I was I was just, I had to get a replacement because I cook so much of my own food.

I don't have a microwave here. I have an electric kettle for hot water for coffee in the morning and just for hot water on demand whenever I want it for tea or coffee. But besides that, it's, it's, you know, conventional oven for cooking and and baking and like that. And so I found an oven from, well,

the guy who advertised it said 1973, but people have said on here it's older. It's great. It's a hot, It's a hot point. It's small and deep. And it is gorgeous. And that puppy has been putting out the most amazing meals and heat in my kitchen as well. And so things in the morning are cold.

But as the day goes on, it gets better. I have a wood system. I got wood delivered. I just got hay delivered. The animals are well. I just got in from chores about an hour ago. And Mabel, my mare, she's a Belgian paint cross. She is doing just fine. She's got her blanket.

She has a shelter that's actually half underground, half above ground. So when she's standing in the back of it, about four feet of her is in the earth and her head pops out from the old stone wall. And she's been pretty comfortable. I've been serving her a lot of her meals in her shelter.

And she has a place where she can be warm, lay down if she wants on hay, stay away from the wind. And she has a big insulated blanket on as well. So she's doing well. Bird update, there's a female hairy woodpecker at the suet feeder. And

I forget how big hairy woodpeckers are compared to the downies that look like the same bird. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. There's so many interesting birds coming to the feeder right now. It's because it's the dead of winter and animals that usually avoid feeders are showing up. Because everything's just ice and snow.

And this is the time of year too, where if I crack the windows, especially now like around the full moon, I can hear the coyotes who pack up in a way to eat that is so hot. interesting because the coyotes, I love coyotes, by the way. They're a symbol of this farm. I love them to death.

I love who they are in the world. I love everything about them, their tenaciousness, their survivability. And this is the time of year where you find a deer, like a young deer, usually a doe, on the property and ripped to shreds because the coyotes teamed up and they took down an animal that

was slowed by deep snow and it was enough to feed the whole pack and you can hear them at nights sometimes over the mountain in the hollers like carrying on like a pack of hyenas and I know it sounds a little scary but to me it's like oh my

neighbors are eating my neighbors are okay good for them you know I can't be too hard on them. I also hunt. I'm a horrible deer hunter when it comes to deer hunting. I'm an amazing falconer. But I don't know. It's nice knowing someone else struggling is eating tonight.

It's nice knowing that someone else is fighting against the cold and finding a way to keep their blood pumping. And they're my neighbors too. So things here have been cold and a little savage, but I've never been in such good spirits this time of year. Part of doing this for so long,

especially doing it the last couple of years where I've come out of a really bad depression and I've gotten medication and I'm feeling so much more in control of my life, has been just getting slowly better at things. And homesteading in winter is one of those things. It's been mostly comfortable.

It's been more uncomfortable worrying about what other people think than how I actually feel, which is something all of us, regardless of your gender or age, have to deal with, not caring about what other people think. And I know that there are people that would wake up in this house with the chill

when the stoves aren't lit and just be miserable and think my life was impoverished and hard and ugly. I don't know, man. I feel like I don't mind waking up in a little bit of a cold house, putting on my slippers, lighting fires, having a hot mug of coffee,

and waiting two or three hours to take off my bigger sweater. You know what I mean? It's part of the payment for not having to get up and get in my car and go to an office or be away from this place or live a life I don't want to live. So...

I feel like when you want to live outside the norms, you feel like it's not legitimate or you're not successful if people who live in the norms wouldn't approve it as comfortable. But it takes a level of luxury and decadence to live how I live and live like everyone else who's middle class.

And I don't think I ever will, nor am I interested in that. But it's been good. That's what I'm saying. It's been good. And I'm feeling encouraged that Today, yesterday, depending on your traditions, it is Imbolc or St. Bridget's Day. It is Candlemas. It is the time of winter when people,

especially people in our ancestors and generations past, knew that they were at a real midpoint of winter. Six weeks ago was the winter solstice when daylight started coming back. And just this morning out during chores, I heard birdsong I haven't heard from certain species in winter.

weeks like since like October months really and the light the sun was shining the sky was blue yes it's cold and the cold's not going anywhere I have not seen a temperature hitting 32 degrees until next Tuesday and my favorite weather channel on YouTube is a gentleman named that max velocity he's fantastic if you want like

Really good weather. He's a meteorologist with his own program on YouTube, but he was going through patterns and shifts and it looks like more cold air is coming to the northeast. So I just got to prepare for it. Keep my systems going. I'm looking at a five gallon bucket of water that was the mayors from last night

that is defrosting. by the wood stove here. I've got my humidifiers going on the stove to get water in this house that's basically got a fire going 24 seven. So it's always dry. I'm drinking about six liters of water a day, I have to make myself or my lips get cracked, my body gets parched.

It's just I'm living in a very dehydrated, warm, splintery kind of place. But What time is it? Let's see. It is... I can't see on my phone what time it is. But I think... Well, I can look at the clock in the kitchen. Wow, real life updates. It is 9.55. And the house is 55 degrees.

When I woke up at 6.30 or so, I slept in until 6.30. It was 42 degrees in my living room. So... So that's about the speed. It will take till noon until the house is comfortable in a way that if you came in from the cold as a stranger,

you would feel like it was any other house as far as indoor temperatures go. So that's the speed of warmth here. Now, please keep in mind, this is a couple of weeks in a winter where it's this bad. Even on a winter like this, it's been abnormally cold compared to winters before.

you know, it got bad a couple weeks, I would say like maybe a week before the solstice. And here we are six weeks later, if eight weeks a year, if two months of a year are just involving a little more sacrifice and discomfort for the spring and summer and fall ahead, I welcome that discomfort.

What a fantastic payment up front. And I have been fantasizing about fly fishing in a way I haven't in years. This cold has brought out a desire for me to be standing in my river. I live near the Battenkill, which is a historic and famous fly fishing river. It's the river that Royal Wolf fished.

It's the river that the Orvis Company was built around. It is from fly fisher folks. It is a stone bottom river. So there are sections that have been succumb to invasive species of algae where if you don't have the right boots on, you will slip and fall in your ass and float down river.

Ask me how I know. However, there's sections I fish that are beautiful stone. You can see five feet down. Well, I can't see five feet down because I would be my eyes would be underwater, but I can stand waist deep and see my toes and just cast to the most beautiful, beautiful native brown and rainbow trout.

So we're a couple months off from me doing that, but I know it's possible. And as much as I love the river and river fishing, it really is a public resource. So there's always people going by on canoes or tubes or boats or other people that are spin fishing, you know, bait fishermen. And

That's fine, but I really am a solitary kind of creature. And so I've been falling in love with backcountry brook trout fishing, finding wild cold streams, especially in like the hottest moments of summer where the river is not really a good place to fish. Unless you're planning on taking every fish you catch home to eat,

you're basically killing anything you would catch for fun, for catch and release. The stress of being caught in water in the 60s or higher is just a death sentence to beautiful fish that are part of our ecosystem and breeding population. So you have to be like a real dipshit or really selfish or just like a bad person

to be catching and releasing in a 70 degree river. I don't care how much you like fishing if you're not taking those fish home to eat. However, here on the mountain I live on, even on my own property, there is a population of brook trout and they're my favorite trout. They are so gorgeous.

I know when people think of fish, they think of like a big bass with like slimy sharp scales and like bulging eyes and a big mouth. They don't think... About these fox-like fish with these gorgeous tiger stripe markings and how they hunt and think and live. And they're just such a beautiful jewel.

And I've fallen in love with their beauty and respect them in such a way that's hard to... explain to folks that don't spend hours casting on rivers. But I just love that I can get a backpack and a small travel, like a tenkara rod, like a small one. Tenkara means there's no reel.

It's a Japanese style of fishing where you basically are just puppeting a fly on the water with these little pop casts that land flies on the water like the natural bugs that would land on the water. And you're hunting these clever, gorgeous little jewels of fish and sweats dripping off your brow and you feel the mosquito bites,

but you can't scratch them because you're scared. Your shadow will scare them away because they're so clever and smart. And if you can see them, they can see you. And they're just as scared of you as any heron that might stop by or raccoon.

And so I'm just thinking about being out with running water on a hot day feet in a cold stream, having lunch or smoking a joint, looking at beautiful fish, and just having that be a day ahead. I have that to look forward to. So do you. So do we all.

Warmer days are coming if we survive to them. But right now, that's the kind of stuff that's carrying me through to spring. It's time to order my seeds soon from High Mowing, which is a Vermont-based seed company that i really appreciate and basically feeds me this is the end of my

stores i don't have anything i grew put up except for some maybe some frostbitten freezer burned rhubarb in the back of my freezer but all the berries all the blanch vegetables all the potatoes except for a couple that are a little too soft and

squishy for me to eat or a little too green most of my winter stores are gone as far as vegetables got plenty of meat My birds aren't laying eggs anymore. They're on their winter furlough. Red-bellied woodpecker just showed up. It's a male. The males and females look so much alike.

You just have to see the red mohawk on them. The females have like a break in the mohawk and the males don't. And he's like, you know, 10 feet away. So I got a good look at him. Everyone's coming to the feeder this morning. Anyway, things here are going to be fine. Spring will come.

I guess I should update you on the animals. I talked about Mabel and her comfort out there. I bring up Mabel because the horses are the real comfort vector here. I don't have to worry so much about sheep besides the fact that they're all winter

fat and covered in wool and have a beautiful four-sided shelter where they can get out of the wind. The sheep are the least of my worries as far as Arctic comfort. The pigs are doing great, but they also have an indoor-outdoor setup where Like I've said many times, they dig themselves a burrow into the hay.

And when I fed them this morning, when they came out for breakfast, they had to like ruffle their heads out of the hay and then come to me, steam off their back. And that's exactly how I wake up in the morning here when it's so cold in the house.

But my body is so warm under the blankets and furs that when I get off to, when I take the blankets off first thing to light the fire and get the hot water going for coffee, that same steam comes off of me. We're all in this together. My birds aren't laying, like I said, they're on a break,

so I'm getting my eggs from Stewart's, which is a local bodega chain around here. Bodega is a term used more in the city, but it's the same thing up here. It's just like a rural bodega. You can get yourself an energy drink, a coffee,

A ham sandwich, bait if you want to go fishing and you're a bait fisherman. There's like a little fridge of like, you know, earthworms or whatever. Fishing hooks are on the wall next to Tylenol and, you know, you can get your cigarettes, get a beer. It's a bodega.

And our local bodega system here of Stewart's is all hooked up to local farms and is some of the best dairy and local eggs in the region as far as commercial purchasing. So got plenty of good milk and dairy within any town has one of those. So I'm not worried so much. My winter stores are doing good.

There's plenty of flour here. Yesterday was a real cold morning and I always skip breakfast. I'm trying to get better about that, but I mean, I have enough coffee to terrify you. But yesterday was so cold and I was just so tired. I needed something for morale. So I made

I got out some baking mix and I made a stack of pancakes that was like six deep. And I covered it with butter and syrup and powdered sugar and just decided to savor every bite after a couple hours of woodwork. And by woodwork, I mean not whittling and like turning tables I mean chopping and loading firewood and

putting the hay away and you know picking out wood to dry and tending fires and I just had like a brunch like a midday meal of a giant stack of pancakes and at that point I didn't have any client work to work on I have some illustrations to get out

to folks today I have thank you by the way if you just found me one person reached out and hired a pet portrait for me thank you so much That's on the way, darling. I'm going to get those sketches out to you as soon as I'm done posting this podcast.

And I'm waiting on some assets from another client to work on a t-shirt design for a school. So there's some freelance design work coming in, which is encouraging. That's some illustration work. I'm still trying to sell pork shares. It's been really hard. I think the economy obviously is hitting everybody.

And a lot of people that would always buy their meat in advance and join the pork CSA here just simply don't have the cash set aside to invest in meat like that. So if you're interested, get in touch, please. I have shares available for piglets I'll be getting this spring from my local

friend and breeder here who breeds heritage hogs over mountain. Her name's Sierra and her and her family breed hogs. Gorgeous pigs. These pigs have been some of the most beautiful, best pigs I've ever had this year. And I'm just really happy with them. They're a mix of...

red wattle and a little bit of yorkshire in there but mostly i think more of like a tamworth kind of hampshire blend there or maybe some berkshire they're a mix of black and pink and spotted and they've got they've all got flop ears and um they

got nice long bodies like a tamworth good baconers i'm excited about them and um So anyway, the pigs are doing good. The chickens are on break. They mostly spend their day in the barn looking on the hay bales over at the pigs and keeping their little talon feet out of the snow.

I've been having the hawk come in most nights that are below zero. She's been doing fine. Her tail is... I cannot wait for that tail to molt out this summer. It'll be such a victory for her and for me when I release her back to the wild with a full, gorgeous... tail after trapping her.

When I trapped her in September, she barely had any tail at all. She had three feathers remaining and the rest were broken. And those three feathers she had remaining have since the tips have broken off, just from crashing into brush and chasing rabbits with me. And so I'm hoping to release her back in the wild hole.

She's healed from her foot injury. She's got a good diet. She's a great hunter, probably the best falconry bird I've had in a while. It'll be sad to see her go, but If I get her through this winter, which was my goal, and get her molted out and a healthy, sexually mature adult,

and I release that animal back in the wild, I will have succeeded greatly. And I'll be ready to take on a bird that might need me for next year. I kind of like this version of falconry. I don't take the most beautiful, strong birds out of the wild. I'm not picking the thing with the biggest feet.

It's not about me and what I can hunt. It's not even really about what the bird can hunt. It's about getting a bird... where it needs to be, and turning it into something it was never going to be without my help. And I really think that Fletch wouldn't have made it without the help of a falconer.

And I'm really grateful to see her growing and blossoming. Oh my goodness, excuse me, Friday, go lie down. No animal politics. I'm talking to my friends. I have a dog sleeping by the fire. A cat wanting the spot closer to the fire. The dog got all snarky about it. It's okay. There wasn't any hissing or bloodshed.

Just animal politics. You all know if you live with cats and dogs. So things here are pretty good. I got through January by the skin of my teeth. The farm made the mortgage. I'm saving up now for the Electric bill, that's my next big bill. And of course, saving up towards the February mortgage.

And one day at a time, I'm going to work on it. The next essay I'll be posting will be based on a note I post. A lot of you came here from the Substack app recently. I have like 50 new subscribers this week.

And a lot of you came because you saw my note for the first time on Substack where I talked about my life and choices I made. And I want to write about that, but I do not want to come to it from this, like, na-na-na-na-na-na aspect of I chose homesteading while the world's falling apart.

That's not useful or interesting or helpful. It doesn't... I mean, if the economy crashes and the world goes into a... and America goes into a real dark time, it won't matter how much planning I did. You know what I mean? If a woman living alone in the woods, if someone decides to, you know, take it from me,

you know, I'm not exactly an army here. Not to get dark. I don't think that's happening. What I'm saying is, there's no like, the choices I made were so poo-pooed. And like, I was called so ridiculous and selfish over the years, especially to think I would make a living through patrons of my arts.

Like it's one thing to decide to be a farmer. It's one thing to decide to be a homesteader. Most of those people are not doing it as like bourgeois artisans. You know what I mean? Trying to bring people into their life experience through their own writing.

I've always felt that like people that are supporting me are getting to be a part of a story and they're reading about a life they may otherwise never have known about. perhaps it's a life they've wanted to live or just someone they want to cheer on.

And me sharing my life story in more detail and personal and vulnerable ways than most people do in my line of work, farming and homesteading. This is not a DIY. This is a diary. This is just a reality show of sorts of someone trying to make this living on the edge of society, making different choices.

And I think I want to write an essay basically about how I really followed my heart with who I wanted to be and the life I wanted to live. And that has led to a decade of real turmoil. Like my 30s were a mess. Oh, my God. So are my late 20s.

But most of my 20s were spent in like corporate offices with like health insurance and like a very active social life and a different world. But my 30s where I really went feral, I had to overcome that. a lot of issues mostly depression um an eating disorder self-esteem issues and just

like dealing with bullies in my own personal life and getting over them coming out of the closet took me forever it took me living alone 10 years on a mountain to get the bravery to come out so I have a real soft spot for late bloomers um Some of us just take a little longer. I mean,

if I was married to a guy out of college, I wouldn't be coming out of the closet till I was like 45. It just takes people. I mean, people go as far as they can in life. And I just set myself up for a life of a lot of solitude. contemplation and hardship. And that, I mean,

if you start training hawks and riding horses through the mountains, taking up traditional archery and building a life of fire and firewood and gardens and dirt and sweat and rivers, you build a sort of story around your life that becomes bigger than the fear of the things you've been avoiding.

And so now I have a confidence I've never had before. I have the confidence people thought I had when I started doing this. People were like, oh, she quit her job to be a farmer full time. What a strong, brave person. It's like, no,

it was a terrified person who had to run to a life that made sense to her so she could survive in a world that made no sense to her. And here I am at 43, still single, Still trying to figure out if the most important thing in the world to me,

which is like a love and storytelling and figuring out our place in the world will ever be a part of my story. But that's really none of my business. I don't think. I'm just trying to keep this farm going. Keep my life solvent as possible. Get better at writing. Get better at fishing and falconry.

get better at my life and relationships with other women and hope I get another summer where I'm not looking at ice forming in the dog bowl in the kitchen and know that there will be days this summer where I will see people talking about how miserable they are in the heat and humidity and

And I will be laying half naked on a rock in my stream, absolutely savoring every mosquito bite, every tick crawling on my arm because there is a freedom in wild places and in understanding how cold it gets and how free you are from that, just from the rotations of the planets. And I look forward to that gratitude.

like a prayer on this in bulk. I know it's just the first spring festival today. It's the beginning of light coming back. It's the beginning of longer daylight. It's the beginning of seeing that corridor of hope towards Astara. And I know we've got six weeks until bunnies and eggs and the blessings of

fertility and thinking about chicks and lambs and all that. But if I keep going, I'll get there, right? Back in Samhain, I had no idea I would be... still on top of things in February. And the whole world seems volatile right now. But I'm just trying to control what I can every day on this small little farm,

keep me and Mayan warm. And I think after I'm done with this, I'm going to make some more pancakes. They're quick, they're filling. And afterward, I can just dive into illustration work and getting into the flow of the work week. I got to get diesel today. I got to run out and get feed.

I got to get to the post office, I think. There's a couple of provisions I want to pick up. I said in a post that I grow and supply 75% of my own meat, eggs, and vegetables, but that's not true in the dead of winter.

I have to go out and get frozen vegetables because my vegetable supplies are out and my birds aren't laying eggs right now. So I'm getting eggs from Stewart's. And meat's still here. I got two chest freezers full of pork and lamb. And some chickens I bought, whole chickens I bought in bulk in the fall.

So I could defrost them for chicken roasts and stuff on Sunday dinners. But today is a day of resupplying. And... Getting some firewood sorted, getting some work done and getting through another winter day. Been playing a lot of music. Been playing a lot of music. I don't know if I said this in a previous podcast.

I've been playing so much music that my left hand seized up and my right forearm from strumming and from fingering the instruments. I played so much that those muscles are having to rebuild and get stronger. So that's encouraging. There's a lot of music happening here. I've been doing a lot of performances for Friday and the Cats.

The goal is to get enough courage to do it. I get a campfire for friends. I'm really focusing on the storytelling. I'm not a very good singer, nor am I a good musician, but I am very good at storytelling. And there's a way to sing and there's a way to play music that makes that story even better.

So I've been really focusing on my versions of stories and songs. And it's been like a fun project. I don't know. Maybe someday if I get the courage, I'll record myself. But right now, I just want to play for friends around the campfire.

And the long term goal is to make it to an open mic night in Saratoga or Albany where nobody knows me or no one knows anything about me. And I can just maybe play a song or two that I've been spending the last couple of winters learning to play.

OK, guys, I don't know how long this recording is, but. That's the update for February. Financially, we're just barely getting by, but I'm not behind. Folks that have been listening to me for years have been... The last five years, I've been like two or three months behind on the mortgage.

And this is the first time in my life I'm finally just getting solvent to the point of keeping up with everyday bills. So... I have Substack to thank for that. I have the patronage of you guys to thank for that. I hope to earn it as much as possible with the quality of writing going up and the

story being true. And the long-term goal is to make enough money to pay off this farm, fix it up. You know what I mean? Get a proper fencing and a proper barn. And then, I don't know, once I have what I need,

Once my walls are safe and I don't have to worry about losing this place to a mortgage and I have a little money set aside, and by I mean a little money, I mean like $5,000 in a savings account. When I have a little money set aside, I can start really helping other farmers.

That's what I want to do. I want to cover farmers' rent. I want to cover farmers' mortgage payments. You have no idea what one month of not worrying about rent or a mortgage can do to make a farm seem possible in other four weeks. I cannot tell you those small things, they change lives.

So I want to do that for other people. I want to do that the rest of my life, help other farmers, especially women trying to do this on their own, because holy crow, I'll tell you what, you may not think there's much to you or that you're not very strong. or not very capable.

But if you just have the determination to keep doing something like this, you become everything you want it to be in a way that really brings peace and confidence to your heart, mind, body, and soul. All right. I got a dog to pet who's half awake and I got to get work started.

I got to stop recording this. But if you're new, thank you. If you're listening for the first time, thank you. And I'll be back with my next essay about... I guess a lot like that note where I talked about my life choices and what they mean.

And I'm not going to be doing it in a way that's like, this is what I did. Aren't I lucky? It's going to be like, this is how you can do this too. Because if I can do this, anybody can do this. I am not. I am not. I mean, I'm not Paul Bunyan.

I am not some, you know, like Davy Crockett. I'm just a woman who had a job in corporate design who bought a farm and started living like fiction. And... I just want to help other people get there too. It's a safer, calmer, more beautiful way of living, I think. All right, my fire is down to ashes.

I got to get there and stoke it. So thank you for listening. Essay is coming. After this post, you can count on your finger five to seven days, and that's when the next post comes out. I never go seven days without a post. A minimum of four essays a week,

one just podcast episode at the beginning of the month like this. And if this is free, that means there will be another private episode later in the month for paying subscribers. So there's always at least three episodes free posts coming from this for non-paying subscribers. And then the rest,

the more personal stuff and like farm businesses for paying subscribers, just because I've learned from the past, if you tell everything for free to everyone, then everyone feels the right to just have their say and judgment come barreling down on you. And I used to think that was something about me.

And I've learned over the years that there's nothing anyone says to me that is about me. It is entirely about them. So that's how life – that's true for all of us and everything. Okay, guys. Stay warm. Stay positive. It's Imbolc, that's hope. We're going to take these six weeks towards Astara. Before you know it,

I will be talking to you from a potluck by a fire with friends and family and music over at Carolina probably when we have our Astara festival with all the kids. And the egg hunting and I'm looking forward to it. And before you know it, I gosh,

I cannot wait till my first posts about being in that river before thunderstorms and watching brook trout slide under rocks in a hidden mountain stream somewhere a thousand feet in elevation with nobody around but me and the sound of the birds. And all right, beautiful things are possible. I know the world's scary right now,

but if you're willing to make it, beautiful things are possible. All right, y'all take care. Stay warm. Thanks for caring about this farm and being a part of my life. And I'll be back in five to seven days with an essay. Y'all take care now.",2,1770077884.0,coldantlercritics,1,1.0,False

* Training framework: PyTorch
* Evaluation based on validation accuracy and inference efficiency

The best-performing model (ConvNeXt Tiny) achieved \~**73% accuracy**, balancing performance and deployment cost. The final system outputs both predicted class and confidence score, enabling downstream decision logic.

Manual inspection of coffee beans is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale. This project addresses that challenge by automating **defect detection and classification** using deep learning.

With a trained CNN model, the system can:

* Process **thousands of beans per day**
* Reduce inspection time by **80%+**
* Eliminate subjectivity in quality grading
* Provide structured data on defect distributions

For coffee processors and exporters, this enables faster screening, lower operational costs, and better compliance with international quality standards. The API-based deployment allows easy integration into existing processing pipelines or inspection lines.

It’s hell on earth everyday. But they want us to pay $3K for a single bedroom in newer developments? How?

Apartments: everything is built so cheaply. Specially the new “luxury” apartments. I am apart of to the problem for investing into renting an apartment in these new buildings.

Water: Brown, constant quality issues, the main water line broke, and many are without water in Newark.

Environment: hostile, aggressive, inhumane, unethical, and dangerous. I’ve witnessed it all. Hit and runs, robberies, murders, shootings, major fires, and more.

Public safety: non existent.

A. It’s you and yourself only. I’ve had to call Newark police several times and was met with the most condescending, dismissive, and rude tone. No sense of urgency if it’s a time sensitive emergency. 

B. Best of luck if you get into a car accident. Newark police don’t take accidents seriously. They’ll demand you to file a report online. Even if the person who hit you doesn’t share proper credentials. I’ve witnessed it first hand.

C. Greedy city councils working with the municipal courts to suck dollars out of people wallets for the sake of increasing city budgets.

D. Corrupt mayor. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is facing a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment from a former city police officer, Laura Cesa. This is just one of a few cases he’s facing at the moment.

Quality of life: worse than a 3rd world country.

A. The parks are barely maintained.

B. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops come and go. Not a single restaurant is worth the dollar unless it’s a business related dinner. You’re better off spending ⁠that money dinning in Jersey City on the Hudson River.

C. Streets are barely cleaned or properly maintained.

D. Diversity: segregated! The east ward of Newark is primarily filled with Hispanics and Brazilians. Many whom don’t speak English. Yet, will crash into your car or cause insurance fraud. So you have to extra cautions driving in the Ironbound area because otherwise you might be a victim of fraud.

I can’t count the days till I’m out of this hellhole. I don’t wish this place on my worst enemy. I honestly don’t know how I’ve survived here this long. I pray for peace and mental health recovery after leaving this dumpster.

Fast forward I keep asking for a decade for him to say nice words to me, he says is hard for him, I tried to go on dates get dressed up, or for spicy time and he laughs on my face, I don't think I'm all that but I'm attractive and fit, I never had lack of male attention, I just wanted his attention.
Now he has a few odd things, he is really mean in situations like, when I had surgery and he mock me all the time because I was organizing everything prior to the surgery, for not helping me with the children and I sleeping with them while I could only be sit up, from throwing a fit because I made him coffee so he could be awake and take care of them while I was going to do physio.
Plus when we have arguments he is so, so mean, he accused me of stealing his card, when I took it to buy diapers, accused me of not being able to see his children, tells me no one likes me and I push everyone away, I had a few family funerals and he always throw a fit, then he decided to recandle a friendship with his ex, knowing it was a no go, and had the audacity to say: ""So"". When i told him that he knew this would hurt me.
Makes holes on the walls when his mad, left in the night before, told me that if I didn't want to clean after his 16yo daughter that rent is due on the 1st... The list goes on, but you got the picture.
Now I'm always angry, I'm not nice and I feel like an abuser, I can't anymore then I have days of hope.
He also has a spending issue owns more then 60k in stuff he buys, we have no bank account together, he had a bank account with his ex that he had NO children with, despite me asking to get his own.
He also says if I leave I will suffer, because financially he is better then me and more educated.
He doesn't look at me, says nothing I feel invisible,  he doesn't touch me, and the problem is also me as he says, I told him I'm done chasing him, but he refuses to make any move, but atm I also don't care as it will be only fkr his benefit, I feel sorry for him too, he keeps saying he is depressed and I'm not helping.
I'm confused, I feel like a mean person and I'm, I'm resentful and sad, I had relationships before that were loving.
Maybe I'm a narcissist, idk, I'm very confused and scared to suffer.

I'm back with more to this saga. I'm actually continuing straight from the last post [{here}](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1ptb1tw/tales_of_community_college_artlad_vs_goodfella_vs/). The cast list is the same and the only thing different is we'll see more of Artlad, Sourface and Goodfella.

**Let's start the** ***talk***

So where we last left off, Goodfella was getting Sourface from his room so we can talk about Ms. Mal-doll knowing my past. Goodfella comes back, dragging Sourface to the sofa and Sourface was not happy.

**Sourface: What the fuck! Why do you need me here?!**

**Me: SOURFACE!**

As soon as I saw him I saw red! From everything that happened from the last tale, it just boiled over.

**Sourface: What? Why are yo-**

**Me: WHY THE FUCK DID YOU TELL MS. MAL-DOLL MY PAST!**

**Sourface: Huh?**

**Bestbro: Look, you told Ms. Mal-doll Dizzy's past and now she threaten to have it publish in the school's newspaper as to both blackmail Dizzy and to get Artlad to date her.**

**Goodfella: Sourface, you better fix this.**

**Sourface: FUCK YOU! I don't care what's going on! Why should I help?!**

**Goodfella: cuz if you don't, Imma tell mom and dad you slept with her and refused to wife her up.**

**Sourface: YOU WOULDN'T!**

**Goodfella: I would!**

I guess Goodfella's and Sourface's family was just as religious as mine's. But how is he going to do that? So I asked:

**Me: How's that going to work? Ms. Mal-doll could deny everything since she like Artlad and would not want to be Sourface's wife.**

**Goodfella: Did you forget that we're basically all witnesses here? Plus Ms. Mal-doll can get a lot of trouble if she tells a story that's not her's and without consent.**

**Me: She said the college wouldn't care.**

**Sourface: How would she know. She already did that once and the college put her on Academic leave when she tried to do that with Queenie.**

Sourface then slaps he's mouth with both hands. Realizing he said something he shouldn't have.

**Me: what did you say?**

**Artlad: What do you mean by that Sourface?**

**Goodfella: it's out in the open. Might as well talk.**

**Sourface: FINE! Ms. Mal-doll found out about me and Queenie when we got caught and she want to publish that to the newspaper.**

**Me: So what happened?**

**Sourface: Well uhhh.... I'm pretty sure the newspaper people got in trouble went I told the head of the campus about it and they told the head it was Ms. Mal-doll who said it was her story, then cracked said it wasn't and cried when they push if she got consent or not.**

**Bestbro: This bitch is beyond stupid.**

**Me: that could mean either she'll try again or.....**

**Goodfella: Or what? She's threating you and not do it?**

**Me: Well yes that but....**

**Artlad: What are you thinking?**

**Me: I don't know but I think this would sound really stupid....**

**Bestgal: Just say it. I'm sure is not that bad right?**

**Me: I can use this to benefit me.**

**Bestbro: Not again!**

**Fey: No no, I wanna here.**

**Me: Just leave it to me. It's my story and Sourface just gave me an ace for this.**

Before anyone can ask me, I walked out and headed home but not before Goodfella stop me in the middle of the hallway. Goodfella asked what was I planning and I told him not to worry. However, I tell right now since in-between planning and meeting her again is not important. The plan was I would call her bluff and dangle over her, as in ""making"" Artlad hate her. But I would make it easier on her if she dates Sourface first. Like a practice relationship. Is that a dick move? Making two people that hate eth other into dating? 100% yes. But I know the question y'all are thinking, how am I going to convince Sourface into it? Well I hoping to convince by telling him the same thing. Date Ms. Mal-doll as practice until you find someone better. Again I'm not the good guy here. To speed run the meet-up. Ms. Mal-doll thought she won, I call her bluff by bringing up what she tried to do with Queenie, she play dumb, I call her bullshit by saying Sourface told me, cue the crocodile tears, I'm not moved, I tell her the Artlad thing, she back tracks and convince her to date Sourface as practice, she says to fuck off but I tell Artlad already knows and he's not happy. At the end, she agreed to date Sourface. I told her that I'll talk to him about it. I found him near the campus cafeteria, same thing happened with him and I told him it's a good idea to practice before finding the real deal. Somehow he agreed. Done and Done right? HAHAHA...haaa....no. This there a reason this still hunts me. I made a point to them to not use my name but I'm not sure they did. none the less, they made it official to everybody by announcing it on the book of faces.

Past me thought ""oh cool, everything will settle right?"" but the now me is like yelling at past me cuz there's no way this would have ended well. So let's fast to a week before Spring Break! Sourface and Ms. Mal-doll have been for almost a month at this point and they really made a big show how ""perfect"" they are. Funny they only did that whenever Artlad was near them and/or when Goodfella and I happened to be together when they are. To burn your brain a little, they were sloppy kissers as in every time any of us saw them, spit was flying everywhere and they tried to recreate that fucking anime kiss with the spit trail. Things in anime should stay in anime cuz BLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Gross! Artlad was planning a Spring Break party at his parents place. Turns out they'll be having their second honeymoon that week and Artlad promise to house sit for them. Knowing him, he'll just empty the liquor cabinet. I was planning to go but Goodfella surprise me with a getaway in Big Bear. Just the two of us. I said yes but later on the day I started to worry. Something was eating at me but I push it aside with popping more pills. So it was me, Artlad and Goodfella sitting outside enjoying the sun when Artlad asked:

**Artlad: So how's it like living your bro again?**

**Goodfella: Horrible!**

**Me: How horrible can it be?**

**Artlad: Something happened?**

**Goodfella: What didn't happened it the better question.**

1. Goodfella started listing things that made me glad I don't live with roommates.
2. Goodfella is a foodie so he's always bring food that isn't American. But Sourface always throws Goodfella's leftovers claim that ""it's gone bad"" and followed by some racist about the food.
3. Sourface leave his underwear everywhere. I thought he was joking but nope, he show pictures of Sourface's underwear on top of the sofa, coffee table and also hanging off the front door handle. Turns out he walk butt-ass naked and removes his undies as sound as he's alone. Why in the shared place? he claim to be ""marking his territory"".
4. He would either have a huge shouting match with Ms. Mal-doll about something and/or have loud cyber-sex with her too. At night. The neighbors and landlord have already gave them notices about it.
5. Sourface would eating anybody's food and will not buy groceries but god for bid anyone eats his food/leftovers cuz he'll make you pay for it. Like full price even thought is was already half eaten.
6. Sourface will not do laundry, their mom comes by every other week to do it and his clothes smell god awful.
7. Piss bottles! Piss bottles everywhere! Both Goodfella and Fey found some in the fridge and Sourface excuse? he was drunk.
8. Sourface was late to pay his bills so Goodfella asked his dad directly to wire the money to him so he can pay. Sourface was not happy cuz he was using that money for his own shit. Sourface now gets an allowance.
9. Sourface hoards all the plates, cups and utensils of the house. Fey walk straight to his room, collected and wash them all and bought Paper plate, cups and plastic utensils for him. Now that's his new hoard.
10. Lastly, the worst one of them all. Sourface would watch porn in the shared tv, with the volume up and sometime jerks it there and leaves his used tissues there. His excuse is to turn them from ""fags"" to straight. Yeah that's not how that works.

Goodfella is glad he hardly does most of the things but he getting pretty close to smack him to next Tuesday. Artlad and I just sat there wondering if what he was saying id for real. Again I wasn't aware of the whole Neckbeard architype so yeah. Then Goodfella asked if I was willing to go out every weekend just for him to leave the apartment. I said I might not always be available all the time. Goodfella pouted a little saying something ""I understand that, I just wanted to spend time with you as partners but I guess is not always easy"" then let out a sad sigh. Artlad jumped in to ~~push~~ ease me up a little and he's sure my family would understand. Me being neurodivergent as always and not getting help for both my untreated ADHD and drug habit, I felt I was being too head strong. I just said that I am free this weekend but wasn't sure the next. Goodfella seemed happy about it so all three of us went on our separate ways. Later on, I was back home when I get a text from Goodfella. He had another fight with his brother again. I vaguely remember no doing any so I asked if he's down to meet me at the park. Of course he said yes, a little too eager but we meet up anyway. We sat at this park bench he just laid his head on my lap and just goes on and on about Sourface being the worst roommate ever. I just listen while playing with his hair.

Goodfella after some time, he out of nowhere says he likes my *soft thighs*. I felt weirded out and told him that I don't like that since I still didn't like a dude yet. Goodfella just waved it off saying ""it wasn't that bad plus I like hugging him so what's the difference?"" Again, I brush it off cuz I felt like I was being odd about it. Goodfella then gets up and ~~drags~~ takes me to this area of the park where there's huge and tall trees and you can't see though them at all. We're in the middle of the area and he stick his tongue down my throat. Goodfella was in heaven while I just stand there, let it happened and it was awkward. It felt like hours but it was like maybe two-five minutes before we pull apart and I was covered in fucking drool, gross. Goodfella then hugs me so tight, saying that's what he needed. We headed our separate ways and while I was wiping the spit off my face, Artlad send me a text.

**Artlad: Hey Dizzy, uhh question. Is Ms. Mal-doll dating Sourface?**

**Me: Yeah, why?**

**Artlad: Then why is she sending me nude pics of herself?**

Oh for the love of god. At this moment, I realized she would cheat on anyone until she has Artlad and at the same time I 100% believe she will cheat on Artlad too since she feels like she's hot shit. I also felt bad for Sourface so I thought the best course of action is to collect evidence.

**Me: You know what Artlad, don't delete anything and get screenshots of all the things she send including text cuz we have to show Sourface. Whatever happens, happens ok.**

**Artlad: Ok.**

There's never a quite moment with this two. I texted Bestbro and Bestgal, asking if they know and Artlad needs some support. They seems just tired of the whole thing and wanted to end this BS. This time I'm not going to be part of it. I was done and I told them so. Artlad wasn't happy but understood. When It was time to show Sourface, Fey left the apartment for a date and Goodfella was with me, exploring the rest of the town. By the time we heard anything from them, we were at this fancy Chinese restaurant when Goodfella's phone start ringing nonstop. Confused he answered. Long story short, there was a huge fight, Sourface blame HIM not Ms. Mal-doll, dishes were thrown, crying nonstop and Sourface kicked everyone out and by the time Fey came home, Sourface was on the floor, crying, broken dishes everywhere and he called Goodfella. Goodfella just sighed and told me everything and we quickly finish our meals and headed to his place. Goodfella wanted me to come and when we arrived, dear god. Not only was there broken plates everywhere, but food and drinks spilled on the floor and Fey was still comforting a crying Sourface and still on the floor. As soon as Sourface saw me, he got up and pointed a finger at yelling ""YOU! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!"" Fear rising, I put my hands up saying dude what happened here! Why is it my fault. Something about how I put Artlad up to it, I was the one to convince Him to cucked him with Ms. Mal-doll, how it was all a big show of making Artlad the bigger alpha and blah blah blah. I told to call Ms. Mal-doll and confront her. But He took a swing at me. I managed to dodge the punch but I ended up tripping and landed one one of the plate shards. Sourface wasn't stopping. So the best thing to do is to dodge until I can get out of the apartment. I yelled something like ""text you later Goodfella"" before Sourface throws a glass me but I managed to close the door. I ran out of there like my ass was on fire.

Lucky for me, all I got was a small cut on my hand. I clean it up, and texted Goodfella. He was not happy. Now his parents are coming to visit cuz in Goodfella's words ""their baby boy is sad that a girl would do that"" so Goodfella wants to spend time with me. I asked my cousin if was cool for Goodfella to come by. She was ok with it but he can't stay for more then 6 hours. Deal I thought so I told Goodfella and he was happy. However, it wouldn't be until a couple of weeks from then. That's means Sourface is going to be the worst roommate then he already was. If your asking, 'the fuck is going on?!' and 'why do any of this?!' well when you're on hard drugs you think is was good idea and it makes sense. However I don't understand how Bestbro and Bestgal just let it happen, I guess burnout hits hard after a while and just let it play out. I sat on my bed thinking, Artlad has to transfer to a different college. I don't think he's safe there anymore. I also started to think maybe if I go to the head of the college since Ms. Mal-doll was put on academic leave before, this has to solve the issue. But I realized I HAD to be sober in order to help out Artlad and also to see what was real and not my drugged out brain making shit up cuz clearly what you have read up this point does not make completely sense.

Later that day, Goodfella texted me saying that Sourface has finally run out of steam and is now crying, loudly, in his room. I asked him if his brother was ok or he needed to be 5150 asap. Goodfella said ""no sadly, he just cries loudly for a few then stops to see if anyone comes to console him, if not starts again.""  Sourface is 21 going on 22 and still acts this way. Still, I asked if there's anything ease Sourface. Goodfella then called me and sound unsure if he should ask. I told him that it couldn't be that bad, Goodfella then tells me the only way to calm Sourface is to do what their mother used to do. It seems their mother used to bake this chocolate pound cake and it always seem to calm Sourface/comfort them when they're sad. I like baking, so I told him I could 100% make it for him though it wouldn't be the same as his mother. Goodfella was happy and said he owned me one and called me the best partner he has ever had and hangs up before I could say thing. So I hop off my ass and get baking. My cousin notice me and remarked how ""it's been a while since you have baked anything"" to which I just said I was busy. Of course like true Mexican, I made too much so I left three loaves for my family while I told the other two to Goodfella's apartment.

So as I arrived to the apartment, Fey and Goodfella were cleaning up the destruction that Sourface had left. I help them to clean up and leave the loaves for Goodfella to give. But Goodfella asked me if it was ok to talk to him, alone, outside the apartment. We step outside and Goodfella hugs me so tight as if I was going to disappear. Goodfella start to cry, not this ugly cry but more like pure exhaustion and desperation. He vented about he thought he finally left all the toxicity behind and how he thought he could finally breath but having Sourface living him is a fucking nightmare. Goodfella and Fey wanted to kick him but they can't afford the apartment without their mother helping them. Can't break the lease either cuz the landlord wanted them to pay out since it was too early to sign off to a different apartment. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't tell him to come live with me cuz one: not my house, two: my cousin would never agree to it and three: even if I want to move out and take Sourface place, I do not make enough make for my share of the rent. The only thing I could do is to invite him to my study time on campus. I normally stay on campus for a good 6 hours but I don't mind staying a couple of hours more is it meant I spend more with Goodfella. Goodfella agreed and thought he needed more time away from the apartment. Noting that Fey spends his time with his new partner. We headed back inside, Goodfella slowly embrace himself to enter the beard's room. Sourface was mad, saw the loaf, took the loaf, meekly said sorry and close the door. With a sigh of relived, I headed back home.

Just my luck, the college send a mass email stating the campus would be close for the following four days due to a squirrel infestation. So classes was cancelled until notice. Goodfella asked me if I wanted to go with him, shopping. This time he needed to replace all the plates, glasses, mugs and other things Sourface had broken. I asked if we can do it in town since I knew a few places he could look. Goodfella agreed and I would meet me outside of his apartment. when I arrived, Goodfella was already waiting for me.

**Me: Hey Goodfella, ready for today?**

**Goodfella: Yes and I do not want to stay in this apartment for a while.**

**Me: So how's Sourface by the way? Is he still uhhh not good?**

With an eyeroll, he waved a dismissive hand and says

**Goodfella: Yeah yeah he's fine. After he ate the two loaves your brought he seemed fine. Plus he usually wakes up around noon when there's no class to go to.**

**Me: Well, want to start heading out? I know a few places within walking distance.**

**Goodfella: Oh Dizzy, I wanted to explore the whole town. I thought we should drive.**

Now to be fair, the area we lived in is almost considered a city due it's size. Walking to see all of it would not be possible. I agreed and since he's driving, I thought I should show some of the better stores. Thing is, this area is mostly a mix language town, meaning there are some stores that only speak Spanish. It's good neighborhood that's mostly Latino. Goodfella was shock to see so many artisan stores, a lot of these stores are just places to get authentic stuff from Mexico and beyond. The first place we into was a simple china shop. The lady who run it wasn't good with English so I translated everything. Goodfella love the shop but couldn't buy anything, not because of lack of funds no no, the china set is too delicate to have around Sourface. So she actually recommended us to her sister's shop two blocks over. We spend hopping from store to store, buying stuff and him asking what kind is the Mexican kitchen utensil is and what is it for. I had fun. However, what surprised me is that Goodfella bought a [Molcajete](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413KK0Khe7L._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) and a [Metate](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CxAIqQ-PL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg). I tried to get him to buy a small mortar and pestle instead of a molcajete but I didn't understand why he wanted a metate. I doubt he would be making salsas lot and he has no idea who to grind flint corn to make tortillas so what gives. He says he wanted something familiar to me in his home. Confused, I asked him why, long story short, so I cook for him. More on that later.

After carrying both molcajete and the metate, not because it'll break if dropped but it'll break the floor if drooped. I'm not kidding, they're made from the heaviest lava rock ever. Once I help put away the dishes Goodfella bought, Sourface merges from his nest. Look at me and he is pissed.

**Sourface: What the fuck are YOU doing here?!**

**Me: I'm just here helping Goodfella! Why the hell are you mad at me?!**

**Sourface: Everything happening is your fault!**

**Me: How?!**

**Goodfella: For the love of god Sourface!**

**Sourface: NO!! This {f-slur and slur for Mexicans} is the reason Artlad is trying to cuck me!**

**Me: ME?! How about going after your whore of a girlfriend who send those pictures in the first place! Artlad keeps rejecting her and she still doesn't listen.**

I shouldn't have said that, the moment I stopped talking is the moment Sourface took a swing at me. Right on the left cheek and this time it fucking hurt and a bruise started to form. As I was lending against the counter, Goodfella and Sourface started to have a shouting match. I got in-between them and push Goodfella outside. I think Sourface went back to his room cuz as I was closing the door, I heard a door slam. Goodfella was telling me sorry over and over again but I told him it's fine and not his fault. Goodfella wanted to walk me home but I didn't want to but I don't remember what happened but he ended up walking with me. He also ended up staying in my home since everybody wouldn't be home until 4pm. So it's me and Goodfella sitting on my bed, quite and listening to music. Goodfella notice my left side of my face was swelling up and when to the kitchen for some ice. I couldn't do homework, couldn't listen to music, nothing, My face was hot and throbbing. Goodfella placed the bag of ice on my face and it was the worst feeling ever. Then I felt a hand sliding up my thigh, dangerously close to my crouch. I quickly got up yelling ""dude what the hell!"" Goodfella half-hearted give a ""oh sorry, I was too focused putting ice"", I just took the ice and place it myself, sitting a little bit away from Goodfella.

My cousin's husband came early that day and calls us out, wondering what the hell we're doing. Seeing my ever growing bruise on my face, he asked how and I told him. He just sighed and said ""boys I swear"" and send Goodfella home. Goodfella give a weird expression  but did leave. I remember laughing cuz the husband joked about how I was only a man for a few months and now I'm getting ass kicked.

As I'm resting on my bed, I get a DM on one of my socials. It was from Ms. Mal-doll. FUCK! She was demanding, not asking, to meet up with her. ""11:00am at Fancy Café near My place. Don't be late!"" read the message and all I could think is ""not enough drugs in the world for this shit"" so delete and I took a nap. It was a long day for sure.

At 8:00am, I was getting coffee when I get message after message from Ms. Mal-doll. I looked up that café, it was way out of my budget. I thought might as well rip the band-aid, if I don't go, she'll just push and push. So I got ready and headed to that overpriced wannabe coffee house. I got there with 30 minutes to spare so I got a booth near the back and ordered a simple coffee. Not long after, in comes Ms. Mal-doll with the biggest resting bitch face I ever saw. Or maybe she was mad but she saw me and sat across from me and order herself a drink. And she went off!

**Ms. Mal-doll: I'm glad you showed your face. But I have a bone to pick with you!**

**Me: Gee, I wander what this time?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Ha ha, funny. No I wanted to talk about Sourface and Artlad. From the looks of it and what Sourface told me, he hit you good.**

**Me: Look Ms. Mal-doll, just say what you want say cuz from here on out, I am not sticking my nose in any involving you nor Sourface.**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Well on one hand you should have called me a whore but you're the only one close enough to Artlad. So I need you to this one favor or I'm telling your story.**

She said the last with a smirk. However, I'll wipe it of by tell her what I know.

**Me: Ms. Mal-doll, Sourface told me and Goodfella about your first time you told someone's story. Including your academic leave.**

**Ms. Mal-doll:** \*her smile changed in to something nasty\* **FINE! You got me. I wasn't going to did. I can't believe Sourface told you.**

**Me: So you were never going risk your tuition huh? Look, I can't make Artlad like you, but why keep pushing?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Artlad is hot duh.**

**Me: That's it?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Yes! I'm heathy with curves. Better then you-know-who, and unlike her, i take of myself.**

I didn't who is she referring to, the latest ex or Queenie? But I just asked the question I've been thinking.

**Me: So why date Sourface? Did you really believed the whole ""get experience on dating"" BS?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: No duh, I agreed to it to get closer to Artlad. But still want you to do this one favor.**

**Me: Huh?**

Before I say anything more she basically want me to make Sourface cheat on her. The reason? So she could run to Artlad to comfort her and fall in love with her. I drink my coffee and said ""NO"" and walk out of there. What a waste of time. At these point, I'm done. No more sticking my nose to their business. However, it wasn't that simple. As I was walking home, Artlad send me a text saying he was planning to transfer to Bestbro's college. The first ever smart decision Artlad did. But knowing how colleges work, it'll be like a year or so. The next day was WORST! Goodfella called me about ten times while having Sourface shouting in the background. Sourface wouldn't shut up about how ""it's Artlad's fault! He cucked me!"" and ""I blame Dizzy! That {gay-slur} made this happened!"" So I made another stupid decision. I called Bestgal and have a ""intervention"" with Ms. Mal-doll. Bestgal warned me that this could get ugly fast and I was willing to risk it. If you're asking 'why only Ms. Mal-doll?' well it's because she's the one being a bish and Sourface at less tried but mostly I did to keep Artlad safe cuz this is getting weird. Until then, I meet up with Goodfella and Artlad at this diner. Both Goodfella and Artlad look so tired, they look like they'll fall asleep at any time.

To make a long story short. Artlad came over to check on Goodfella but Sourface was still there and cue the yelling, the crying and refusal of letting Artlad leave until he ""confessed to his crimes"". This took a while. Again Sourface cried and cried and he ran back to his room to loudly cry. Goodfella and Artlad left the apartment right after Sourface hid in his room and met me at the diner.

**Goodfella: I. Hate. Sourface. So much right now!**

**Artlad: Was he always like this?**

**Goodfella: Yes and no. He would cry to mom or dad to get something he wants but this is the first Sourface really went to the deep end.** 

**Me: I'm sorry guys. I all of this is my fault and sticking my nose where it doesn't belong.** 

**Goodfella: Dizzy....you never made Ms. Mal-doll act like a whore.** 

**Artlad: Good thing I could transfer to a new college. I thought I would being in community college to save money but guess not.** 

**Me: Let's promise to stay away from both Sourface and Ms. Mal-doll for now. I also promise I WILL NOT get into someone else's business.** 

**Artlad: Fair.**

**Goodfella: Oh believe me. I don't even want to look at Sourface when he's like this.**

The rest of the time was us was eating/drink in total silence. The next few days was odd. I was basically counting the hours to go back to class and avoiding the drama like the plague. Artlad had it easier since he wakes up early to work out and has able to hang/stay with other friends for the time being. Goodfella however, wasn't so lucky. even though Goodfella started to wake up early and come late to avoid Sourface but Sourface wasn't a easy person to live with. Sourface had this habit to play loud music/be noisy with everybody in the apartment. Is gotten to the point that the Landlord send them a warning. Sourface was doing to ""punish"" them? To this day I haven't no idea. What was also weird, Artlad wasn't talking/texting anyone at all. Bestbro did informed us that he's doing fine, just taking a break. Goodfella and I have been hanging out more and more just to keep mind off of things. As more and more we hung out, the closer we got. And by ""we"" I mean Goodfella getting bolder and more handsy with me. Claiming ""cuddles calms his nerves"" but why always in his car and/or where people can see? More on that on the next part.

1quccjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatesSnark/comments/1quccjl/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1. Katie Clark has quickly learned how to filter her comments.  After releasing a long statement of her own that basically said in a nutshell, “I’m not out here trying to get a divorce”, she posts a CVS ad and heavily filters the comments.  The comments that are left rain praises on her for being such a strong woman, for carrying on and tons of prayers are sent her way.  The only prayer Katie wants is one that asks the good Lord to cut Travis off at the knees if he even thinks of looking in the direction of a woman.  No one seems to notice or care that she is still exploiting her children, who appear in the ad, even in the midst of what is supposed to be her utter grief and turmoil.  She is mostly quiet on social media, and a Redditor reports seeing the entire Clark family together in Disney World.  This lines up with Travis being in Florida for New Year’s Eve, and it also lines up with Katie being featured in a picture with Alyssa. IF Travis was locked up in some fancy Christian Rehab, he seems to be back at home now… we guess.  Katie films and shares some nasty frozen meal service, an ad for the MedSpa and shows snaps of her playing in the snow in her backyard.  The kids are with her but there is no sign of Travis.  He has probably been relocated to behind the lens for a while and that is probably his biggest punishment of all.  Dude loves the spotlight, don’t forget.  The story of Travis and the nursing student appears to be dying on the vine, just as the Bates Crisis Management Team (Gil and Kelly) planned.  Katie can’t afford to fade to black, so expect a return to normal by Spring.  Travis Clark - Godly Family Man Extraordinaire is coming to a social media platform near you.  Soon.

3.Josie Bates is all in on the Tradwifery train.  Girlfriend has finally closed the pool noodle shop, gone back to her light brown roots, bought a cart full of pajamas and yoga pants in colors with names like “beige”, “sandalwood”, “desert stone”,  “raw dough”“pine straw” and turned her camera on her unsuspecting children. She churns out the same content over and over.  She has a new partnership with some spackling mud style makeup that she wants you to buy.  The blush is only $80 a container, so hop right on that “deal”.  The second her doctor signs the slip clearing her for active duty, she’s back in that torture chamber attempting to lift 8,000 pounds while positioning her camera to catch all the best booty shots.  Of course to make it all seem more real, she takes a page out of Carlin’s book and fake cries about how hard it is.  Then she heads home to try and up her numbers by reposting everything on her YouTube platform.  This mundane BS isn’t bringing in the numbers it once did, so Josie knows just how to fix that… she films her daughters taking a bath and walking from the tub in nothing but towels.  That does the trick and she gets almost a million view.  Should we discuss why that one does such BIG numbers, or does everyone get it?  Luckily, the Balkas don’t get snowed in with the Stewarts for the latest snow storm and Josie doesn’t have to run from the camera.  Instead, she sets up the tripod and forces her kids to work the entire day while they try to just have fun with the snow. Josie seems flat these days, and her content is mind numbingly redundant.  She was much happier as a Glamazon.  The cult always win though… it truly is undefeated in turning these vibrant women into shocking shells of who they hoped and dreamed to be.  4 kids in and Josie has raised the white (beige) flag.

4.Well, Alyssa Webster almost did it.  She almost went completely black on social media, but the urge to brag is just too strong with this one.  She can’t help but post a January carousel of what the Websters have been up to.  Would you believe that it’s the exact same things they are always up to?  We see John and Alyssa having date nights at chain restaurants, the kids getting the privilege of watching dear old dad play softball, Rhett moves to a single bed, stacked in a room now with Maci and Zoey, and Lexi gets to go on her weird creepy date with dad on her birthday.  She also gets a prized large coffee shop drink to really celebrate.  The true reason this carousel was shared though isn’t the newish boots hermetically sealed to Alyssa’s feet…it’s one lone picture with Katie.  Taken in Florida, in the dark of night, and filtered into oblivion…. Just the 2 sisters, smiling at whomever is snapping away.  Interesting that Alyssa saw fit to share this now, when she hasn’t shared a thing about her family in years.  It’s there for a reason, you can bet on it.  Meanwhile, Ellie Bates is hitting the Colorado slopes and sharing it all without abandon to her Instagram stories.  She’s chasing the high of going viral, but without any nieces and nephews to exploit, her numbers are struggling.  She shows off her $350 designer snow boots and films herself doing lots of snow activities.  She gets the biggest boost on a reel of her holding hands with baby Kaia.  It’s because the music she uses is by a band named “Cigarettes After Sex” and you know how the fundies feel about sex…. Or cigarettes for that matter.

5.Zach and Whitney had a big secret these past few weeks.  Zach left Whitney behind for what she called a “great opportunity” and a “business deal”.  Is that code for influencer trip?  Whitney was supposed to fly out and meet him, but the threat of an ice storm canceled those plans.  Funny enough, the potential storm did not send him racing home to his family.  I don’t know what brand he may have gone on a trip with… Zoe strollers had an event in Palm Beach, but surely Zach wouldn’t be there without Whit.  Anyway, he made it home just in time to exploit his kids while making a big welcome home reel, and then it was back into the kitchen.  Zach spent about 9 minutes of his latest Bates Kitchen vlog complaining about things.  His stove doesn’t half work and his burners aren’t even.  He also fully admits that he is no longer buying high quality cuts of beef “just for” this vlog.  The rest of the time he tells you not to do what he just demonstrated and as usual, I get distracted counting all of the open wounds on his hands.  He is sponsored by some perfume smelling laundry detergent and he shows off his half completed laundry room while hawking it.  They recently moved the laundry upstairs and Zach says no electrical has been run yet, but he still takes clothes out of the washer and puts them into the dryer.  At damn near 40 years old, this grown man is spending his days playing pretend.  Dude’s biggest dream in life is to be David Venables.

6.Trace and Lydia have milked the yearly vacation for 2 weeks of content.  The Bates head to Keystone, Colorado to show off their high dollar ski equipment and act like they are at qualifying for the Winter Olympics.  Gil, Kelly and all of the younger kids make the trek. Lawson joins them for part of the week, but beyond that, Trace and Lydia are the only influencers on the trip this year.  Trace makes so many cringy reels, including getting fully dressed in his snowboarding outfit, strapping on his snow board and standing on the bed.  He and the brothers ditch Lydia as much as possible for time away from the bunny slopes, and Lydia seems to spend a ton of time at the cabin with Gil and Kelly.  I wonder how the Bible Baptist parishioners feel about their leader ditching them for a fancy Colorado ski trip?  Trace turns 29 while they are away, and Kelly praises him for planning the entire trip.  She also says his luggage got lost on the way home Saturday, but Lydia makes no comment about that.  Probably because she is still pretending to be ON the ski slopes.

7.Michael posts to IG showing her spending time with the Balka kids, and holding baby Brooks.  She obviously has a sweet spot for Josie’s kids.  She also has a new recipe where she makes doo-doo… I mean protein… balls and no bake peanut butter cups.  Michael is like a drill sergeant in the kitchen but I suppose this is better than the Bible Study Brandon threatened us with.

8.Man, when Erin Paine comes back to social media she REALLY comes back.  She’s been posting non stop for 2 weeks, showing off all of her doodles for sale and her brand new version of beef fat that is miraculously formulated for “mature skin”.  You don’t think that’s targeted to the grandmas that are always commenting on her posts do you?  Erin has new promotional advertising explaining all of the benefits of coating yourself in animal grease.  Of course she wants you to know that her beef fat is “ethically sourced”…. Does that mean they ask permission from the cow before extrapolating it?  I had to laugh at the comment from the person asking if the fat comes from her grandparents cows.  I mean… really?  She also sends out promotional packages giving it away to other tradwife influencers, and once again falls victim to the “nice nasty” Christian ilk.  One influencer posts Erin’s products and asks her (much larger) audience if any of them have ever heard of Erin/Erin’s product.  She goes on further to say that she needs to know if it’s ok for her “sensitive skin” and hopes SOMEONE in her audience has tried it.  Ouch.  There’s no hate like Christian love.  Erin also takes a few swipes at the Big 3 this week…. First by saying she doesn’t trust influencers “marketing” tactics, and then… just days after the sisters visit a fancy MedSpa for a facial, she shows the world HER facial, which is steam from a pot of broccoli.  Damn, this Erin is fun.  Too bad CheeAd will show up soon and take her phone away again.

9.Lawson and Tiffy are busy pretending their newborn is only 1 week old.  In reality he is almost 2 months old.  In their vlogs they are just leaving the hospital.  None of this would be problematic if they didn’t ask for prayers or advice.

1qucbnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1qucbnk/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1. Katie Clark has quickly learned how to filter her comments.  After releasing a long statement of her own that basically said in a nutshell, “I’m not out here trying to get a divorce”, she posts a CVS ad and heavily filters the comments.  The comments that are left rain praises on her for being such a strong woman, for carrying on and tons of prayers are sent her way.  The only prayer Katie wants is one that asks the good Lord to cut Travis off at the knees if he even thinks of looking in the direction of a woman.  No one seems to notice or care that she is still exploiting her children, who appear in the ad, even in the midst of what is supposed to be her utter grief and turmoil.  She is mostly quiet on social media, and a Redditor reports seeing the entire Clark family together in Disney World.  This lines up with Travis being in Florida for New Year’s Eve, and it also lines up with Katie being featured in a picture with Alyssa. IF Travis was locked up in some fancy Christian Rehab, he seems to be back at home now… we guess.  Katie films and shares some nasty frozen meal service, an ad for the MedSpa and shows snaps of her playing in the snow in her backyard.  The kids are with her but there is no sign of Travis.  He has probably been relocated to behind the lens for a while and that is probably his biggest punishment of all.  Dude loves the spotlight, don’t forget.  The story of Travis and the nursing student appears to be dying on the vine, just as the Bates Crisis Management Team (Gil and Kelly) planned.  Katie can’t afford to fade to black, so expect a return to normal by Spring.  Travis Clark - Godly Family Man Extraordinaire is coming to a social media platform near you.  Soon.

3.Josie Bates is all in on the Tradwifery train.  Girlfriend has finally closed the pool noodle shop, gone back to her light brown roots, bought a cart full of pajamas and yoga pants in colors with names like “beige”, “sandalwood”, “desert stone”,  “raw dough”“pine straw” and turned her camera on her unsuspecting children. She churns out the same content over and over.  She has a new partnership with some spackling mud style makeup that she wants you to buy.  The blush is only $80 a container, so hop right on that “deal”.  The second her doctor signs the slip clearing her for active duty, she’s back in that torture chamber attempting to lift 8,000 pounds while positioning her camera to catch all the best booty shots.  Of course to make it all seem more real, she takes a page out of Carlin’s book and fake cries about how hard it is.  Then she heads home to try and up her numbers by reposting everything on her YouTube platform.  This mundane BS isn’t bringing in the numbers it once did, so Josie knows just how to fix that… she films her daughters taking a bath and walking from the tub in nothing but towels.  That does the trick and she gets almost a million views.  Should we discuss why that one does such BIG numbers, or does everyone get it?  Luckily, the Balkas don’t get snowed in with the Stewarts for the latest snow storm and Josie doesn’t have to run from the camera.  Instead, she sets up the tripod and forces her kids to work the entire day while they try to just have fun with the snow. Josie seems flat these days, and her content is mind numbingly redundant.  She was much happier as a Glamazon.  The cult always wins though… it truly is undefeated in turning these vibrant women into shocking shells of who they hoped and dreamed to be.  4 kids in and Josie has raised the white (beige) flag.

4.Well, Alyssa Webster almost did it.  She almost went completely black on social media, but the urge to brag is just too strong with this one.  She can’t help but post a January carousel of what the Websters have been up to.  Would you believe that it’s the exact same things they are always up to?  We see John and Alyssa having date nights at chain restaurants, the kids getting the privilege of watching dear old dad play softball, Rhett moves to a single bed, stacked in a room now with Maci and Zoey, and Lexi gets to go on her weird creepy date with dad on her birthday.  She also gets a prized large coffee shop drink to really celebrate.  The true reason this carousel was shared though isn’t the newish boots hermetically sealed to Alyssa’s feet…it’s one lone picture with Katie.  Taken in Florida, in the dark of night, and filtered into oblivion…. Just the 2 sisters, smiling at whomever is snapping away.  Interesting that Alyssa saw fit to share this now, when she hasn’t shared a thing about her family in years.  It’s there for a reason, you can bet on it.  Meanwhile, Ellie Bates is hitting the Colorado slopes and sharing it all without abandon to her Instagram stories.  She’s chasing the high of going viral, but without any nieces and nephews to exploit, her numbers are struggling.  She shows off her $350 designer snow boots and films herself doing lots of snow activities.  She gets the biggest boost on a reel of her holding hands with baby Kaia.  It’s because the music she uses is by a band named “Cigarettes After Sex” and you know how the fundies feel about sex…. Or cigarettes for that matter.

5.Zach and Whitney had a big secret these past few weeks.  Zach left Whitney behind for what she called a “great opportunity” and a “business deal”.  Is that code for influencer trip?  Whitney was supposed to fly out and meet him, but the threat of an ice storm canceled those plans.  Funny enough, the potential storm did not send him racing home to his family.  I don’t know what brand he may have gone on a trip with… Zoe strollers had an event in Palm Beach, but surely Zach wouldn’t be there without Whit.  Anyway, he made it home just in time to exploit his kids while making a big welcome home reel, and then it was back into the kitchen.  Zach spent about 9 minutes of his latest Bates Kitchen vlog complaining about things.  His stove doesn’t half work and his burners aren’t even.  He also fully admits that he is no longer buying high quality cuts of beef “just for” this vlog.  The rest of the time he tells you not to do what he just demonstrated and as usual, I get distracted counting all of the open wounds on his hands.  He is sponsored by some perfume smelling laundry detergent and he shows off his half completed laundry room while hawking it.  They recently moved the laundry upstairs and Zach says no electrical has been run yet, but he still takes clothes out of the washer and puts them into the dryer.  At damn near 40 years old, this grown man is spending his days playing pretend.  Dude’s biggest dream in life is to be David Venables.

6.Trace and Lydia have milked the yearly vacation for 2 weeks of content.  The Bates head to Keystone, Colorado to show off their high dollar ski equipment and act like they are at qualifying for the Winter Olympics.  Gil, Kelly and all of the younger kids make the trek. Lawson joins them for part of the week, but beyond that, Trace and Lydia are the only influencers on the trip this year.  Trace makes so many cringy reels, including getting fully dressed in his snowboarding outfit, strapping on his snow board and standing on the bed.  He and the brothers ditch Lydia as much as possible for time away from the bunny slopes, and Lydia seems to spend a ton of time at the cabin with Gil and Kelly.  I wonder how the Bible Baptist parishioners feel about their leader ditching them for a fancy Colorado ski trip?  Trace turns 29 while they are away, and Kelly praises him for planning the entire trip.  She also says his luggage got lost on the way home Saturday, but Lydia makes no comment about that.  Probably because she is still pretending to be ON the ski slopes.

7.Michael posts to IG showing her spending time with the Balka kids, and holding baby Brooks.  She obviously has a sweet spot for Josie’s kids.  She also has a new recipe where she makes doo-doo… I mean protein… balls and no bake peanut butter cups.  Michael is like a drill sergeant in the kitchen but I suppose this is better than the Bible Study Brandon threatened us with.

8.Man, when Erin Paine comes back to social media she REALLY comes back.  She’s been posting non stop for 2 weeks, showing off all of her doodles for sale and her brand new version of beef fat that is miraculously formulated for “mature skin”.  You don’t think that’s targeted to the grandmas that are always commenting on her posts do you?  Erin has new promotional advertising explaining all of the benefits of coating yourself in animal grease.  Of course she wants you to know that her beef fat is “ethically sourced”…. Does that mean they ask permission from the cow before extrapolating it?  I had to laugh at the comment from the person asking if the fat comes from her grandparents cows.  I mean… really?  She also sends out promotional packages giving it away to other tradwife influencers, and once again falls victim to the “nice nasty” Christian ilk.  One influencer posts Erin’s products and asks her (much larger) audience if any of them have ever heard of Erin/Erin’s product.  She goes on further to say that she needs to know if it’s ok for her “sensitive skin” and hopes SOMEONE in her audience has tried it.  Ouch.  There’s no hate like Christian love.  Erin also takes a few swipes at the Big 3 this week…. First by saying she doesn’t trust influencers “marketing” tactics, and then… just days after the sisters visit a fancy MedSpa for a facial, she shows the world HER facial, which is steam from a pot of broccoli.  Damn, this Erin is fun.  Too bad CheeAd will show up soon and take her phone away again.

9.Lawson and Tiffy are busy pretending their newborn is only 1 week old.  In reality he is almost 2 months old.  In their vlogs they are just leaving the hospital.  None of this would be problematic if they didn’t ask for prayers or advice.  Tiffy is still making random comments about Will not eating….and she complains about the number of diapers they have to change.  None of their 50s sitcom reels do big numbers, so Tiffy goes back to the brother Eric wheelhouse again and reuses the same 15 seconds of footage featuring the 2 of them together as children to cobble together another reel about him and about adoption.  Suddenly, it hits the algorithm and she nets 10 million views.

1quc682,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1quc682/3months_since_my_new_year_resolutions_started_in/,"3months since my ""New Year resolutions"" (started in november)","So every past year was the same BS. January hits, I'm all in on the new habits, maybe make it to February if I'm lucky, then crash back to exactly where I started. For 2026 I tried something different: started in November and it has been epic for me.  
now three months in and I'm actually seeing progress. Here's what worked and what flopped.

What's actually working:

Consistent sleep without the phone rule perfection. I aimed for 11-12pm every night instead of my usual 1-3am chaos. The ""no screens 30 minutes before bed"" thing? Yeah, still can't nail that one. But just having a consistent bedtime has done more than any elaborate wind-down routine ever did.

Switching off coffee (this one surprised me). I was that person who felt like SHIT until the first sip of coffee . Started using adaptogens and nootropics instead, I bought them separately at first, then found an all in one blend so I didn't have to deal with measuring five different powders every morning.

The difference? I wake up ready to go. Not great, not bouncing off walls, just... functional. No more ""can't talk to me until I've had coffee"" mornings. That shift alone has been worth it.

Short workouts instead of motivation binges. Used to get inspired, run way too much for a week, hurt myself, then do nothing for months. Now it's just 30 minutes to an hour depending on time/motivation, I try to do it everyday at least go out and move my body for 20 minutes. Boring but sustainable. Turns out consistency beats intensity when you're trying to build something that lasts.

What didn't work:

Trying to do everything at once. Sleep, exercise, diet, supplements, meditation, journaling, all in the first week. Burned out immediately. This time I added one thing at a time over weeks. Way less exciting, way more realistic.

The takeaway:

Starting in November meant zero pressure. No ""new year new me"" posts, no accountability partners asking how it's going. Just me making small changes when nobody cared. I think that's why it's stuck, there's no audience to perform for or disappoint. (Which really that ""audience"" is your mind playing you tricks to boycott yourself)



What habits have actually worked for you long-term? Especially curious if anyone else has found ways to make things stick without relying on motivation or willpower.",4,1770076713.0,Life,7,1.0,False

A little history: I got sick over Christmas break and missed several doses, and have been taking it much closer to my coffee intake (within 20-30 minutes of having coffee) the last few weeks, instead of taking it at 3am and going back to bed. Since my lab results, 7 days ago, I’ve been taking it at 3am and no coffee or food until after 5am, and my endo upped it to 137 instead of 125 levothyroxine.

Im from the east coast of the USA. Looking for people from any country. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Work is usually pretty slow unless something breaks or needs to be installed. Otherwise, im in my office most of the day on my phone. I'm down to share photos, too, if curious what I look like.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. I love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1770076243.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My primary said it’s way too high to be cleared. 

A little history: I got sick over Christmas break and missed several doses, and have been taking it much closer to my coffee intake (within 20-30 minutes of having coffee) the last few weeks, instead of taking it at 3am and going back to bed. Since my lab results, 7 days ago, I’ve been taking it at 3am and no coffee or food until after 5am, and my endo upped it to 137 instead of 125 levothyroxine. 

Is there any hope in getting it down with this plan in the next week or two? When I get my labs drawn again? Has anyone had surgery rescheduled because of this situation?

I've had so many candle light dinners with my moka pot, so many scenic picnics way out in the middle of no where Aotearoa, lit up brew in while caving, also few times taken it for adventure and disappointingly forgot the coffee!

Biggest one, keeping the rim of the bottom part of the moka pot free of grounds before you screw it in, helps the seal last several years building up with coffee grounds you can not get out.

This is also sort of done as shit post against the panic of moka pot dirtyness.

\*\*edit this is not tamping, it's more like sort of very loosely packed sand, gently tapped in with a finger.

**About me:** I am a master’s student in a demanding STEM field. I would describe myself as an intellectually curious person, and I love to read and learn new things. My intellectual interests are very diverse, ranging from science and economics to history and culture. Whatever excites you in life, I will probably enjoy listening to you share it. While I spend much of my time studying, there is much more to me than a bookworm. I have lived, studied, worked, and travelled widely in Europe, and I always enjoy visiting new places. I’m also a longtime athlete who enjoys many sports and tries to remain active amid a busy schedule. While I am not socially weird or shy, I am not the type to party or go out frequently either. I would prefer to relax with a book and some coffee or share a meal in a peaceful setting. Appearance-wise, I’m white, tall, and not bad-looking.

**What I’m looking for:** I come into this with *no expectations at all.* I have no intention of putting labels on things early. Being a relatively cerebral person, I connect best with people of a similar disposition. My hope is to find someone with whom I have some chemistry and see how things evolve. If it turns into a relationship, that’s great. If it turns into a friendship, that’s also great. If it turns into nothing at all, that’s perfectly fine!

**About you:** as stated above, I come in with no expectations. I am open to many types of people and I’m not going to filter others aggressively based on superficial characteristics. Ideally you will be a somewhat intellectual person as well, but I know that intelligence comes in many forms and I appreciate them all. Kindness is very attractive to me. Bonus points if you’re a morning person like I am.

**What’s next?** If this post intrigued you, send me a chat and tell me about something that excites you. I’d love to learn about something you’re passionate about. I’m happy to exchange pictures if you would like. Looking forward to meeting you!",1,1770076100.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False

1qubvh2,https://i.redd.it/c0o9jg7m46hg1.jpeg,[OS] I built a small macOS visual editor with syntax highlighting for my own creative workflow,"Hey everyone,

\> Built by a human. AI tools used selectively for ideation and assets.

I’m a Data Scientist working in enterprise IT (mostly Python/Cloud infra). Like many of you, I spend half my life in VS Code or JetBrains IDEs. They are powerful, but they are also heavy.

Sometimes I just need to quickly tweak a Python script, check a JSON config, or review a README without launching a browser instance wrapped in a desktop app or waiting for an indexing process to finish. I wanted something that felt like a native citizen of macOS—fast, lightweight, and respectful of my battery life—but still had modern syntax highlighting.

So, I built [**Neon Vision Editor**](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor).

It’s an alpha release, written purely in Swift and AppKit. No Electron, no cross-platform abstraction layers, no telemetry. Just a text editor that opens instantly and lets you work.What it is:

Native & Fast: Built for macOS 26 (Tahoe) using Apple Silicon.

Zero Bloat: No project management, no plugins, no background indexing.

Readable: High-contrast syntax highlighting for Python, C/C++, Swift, HTML, CSS, etc.Privacy-First: It doesn’t phone home.

Includes AI features for the use of Apple foundation model (and others) for syntax suggestions (currently not functional yet)

Why I built it:

In my day job handling it infrastructure and migrations, complexity is the enemy. I wanted a tool that does one thing well: edits text. I don’t need my text editor to play music or brew coffee; I just need it to open a 10MB log file without choking.

Current Status:

It’s currently in v0.2.5-alpha. It’s stable enough for daily use (I use it for all my quick edits), but it is a work in progress.

Where to get it:

You can grab the build from GitHub Releases:

https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor

I’d love to hear what you think. I’m specifically looking for feedback on load times with large files and how the syntax highlighting feels to other developers.

When there is no possible underling mechanism/bridge of incidence which makes this happen, it's just pure assumption, is it possible to manifest. Or is chatgpt correct in saying that there MUST be a possible bridge o incidence which support the outcome , otherwise that thing is not possible to manifest

This is from chatgpt, in general does chatgpt answer loa questions accurately? I find it strictly remains around what Neville says, is Neville right about everything?

# 'Final answer (strictly within Law of Assumption)

Yes.

It is impossible to manifest something for which no bridge of incidents can exist.

Not because you lack belief —

but because manifestation operates by rearranging reality through unseen, natural events, not by violating causality.

The coffee cannot appear from nothing.

But you can absolutely experience a reality where the coffee arrived in a way you never predicted, never noticed, and cannot retrace.

And that is precisely what Neville meant by:

**CHAPTER 1: THE BUTT HAND COMETH**

“Nothing up my sleeve!” cackles the pockmarked and meth-addicted version of Daniel Radcliffe standing before me. He isn’t really Daniel Radcliffe, at least I don’t think so, unless Daniel committed to method acting for a role of a bug-eyed maniac who’d murdered an old-timey magician and stolen his outfit. The mustachioed imposter stares at me from beneath the brim of a dusty, oversized top hat, grinning like the Cheshire Cat or a sixth-grade boy preparing to deliver the most well-timed “that’s what she said” joke in the history of the universe.

The vaudeville-era villain leapt at me from the narrow alley alongside a shuttered Charles Cheddar’s, one of those child-casino chain pizza joints featuring a monstrous man-rat hybrid mascot. This particular Charles Cheddar’s had been shut down for about ten years, along with most of the other businesses in the strip mall. Charles Cheddar the pizza rat leers from the faded sign above the broken windows of his fallen kingdom, his hollow gaze symbolic of his fall from grace. The dark shadows of the abandoned video games, slides, and ball pit remind the viewer that the joys of childhood, like everything else, are subject to the whims and mercy of Father Time, who’s kind of a prick.

Daniel takes one white-gloved (yet suspiciously browned) finger to his sleeve, pulling it back. Two bottles of Secret Gully™ brand ranch dressing fall out of his sleeve and splatter on the ground, creating a sidewalk bukkake, which would be a pretty great band name and a pretty poor search engine term.

I’d be shocked by this occurrence if I hadn’t grown up in Rosedale, Pennsylvania; the sweaty grundle of the world. This is probably just someone I went to high school with who developed a pesky meth addiction after his father’s murder-suicide or something. This kind of thing is more common than you’d think out here. The guy is likely so high out of his mind that he truly believes he’s putting on a show on the Vegas stage.

“I am performing on the biggest stage of all,” Daniel rasps presciently. His eyes change their hue like sunlight dancing upon crashing waves. “I am performing a trick that none others dare attempt! I will open a rift in the space-time continuum and bring an end to your quest!”

“I don’t have any change, dude. But there’s a detox place just on the edge of town. Group counseling, social work services…”

“YOU WILL TOUCH MY BUTT HAND!” Daniel Radcliffe screams.

“Uhh…”

“IT SHALL SOIL YOUR SOUL WITH A STINKY AND WET CARESS!”

“I think the words you just said, at least in that order, are illegal.”

He does a twirl and a bow which is kind of smooth, but then his hat falls off and he has to gather it and not appear flustered. Honestly, for being high on meth he does a pretty good job. He huffs, “I am Daniel Silverpasture; a miracle magician of space and time! And your last breaths will be gasped both praising and rueing the power of the almighty butt hand! Its reach is beyond your scope and comprehension; its stinky fingers molest the moist folds of the cosmos!”

I sigh and say, “Start a blog or something, man. I’m sure people would love to hear about your moist folds or whatever. In the meantime, I have to go be a slave to corporate capitalism. Good day, sir.”

“Gaze and be amazed! Stare into my felty hole and see possibilities greater than your mind can comprehend!” Daniel holds his top hat toward me. He wiggles his fingers around the edge of the hole in a manner which should have him permanently placed on some type of watch list before shoving his hand inside.

“Great, now I have to find a therapist and go into debt once insurance denies me reimbursement. Then my caring therapist and I have to have an awkward conversation about an unpaid balance when they really just want to help me. You’ve proactively ruined their day. How do you feel about that?”

Daniel grunts. “Ooouuughh. The rifts! Oooowaaaguh. The folds! They’re parting! It’s crowning!” He continues shoving his arm into the hat and that’s when I notice that it’s gone too far inside, disappearing all the way up to the elbow.

“How… how are you doing that?”

“And now for my greatest trick!” Daniel screams.

I look around the parking lot. There’s a closed-down Better Purchase tech store which looms over the pavement like a desecrated shrine to a forgotten deity. A couple of spots down there’s a Chinese buffet run by a lovely Turkish couple which never has customers because everyone (including the cops) knows it is a drug front. There’s a Dollar Admiral where many of the town’s residents do their shopping, but it’s off hours and I can’t even see any workers inside. Most of the other stores are abandoned or empty and the few cars in the lot are likely my coworkers at J-Mart.

The point is: there’s absolutely no one else around to witness the madness of the meth-addicted magician Daniel Radcliffe sticking his arm through a top hat as he turns around and points his ass directly at me.

It’s at this point you should question if this book is for you.

“OH MIGHTY BUTT HAND, I SUMMON THEE! YOUR STINKY GRASP KNOWS NO BOUNDS! YOUR TOUCH PERMEATES WORLDS AND SOULS. COME FORTH AND SULLY THIS FOOLISH HERO!”

Daniel’s hand rips through the fabric of his pants, launching out and grasping toward me while sticking directly out of his asshole.

I warned you.

“THE BUTT HAND COMETH! NOW TOUCH IT! I DOUBLE DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER DARE YOU TO TOUCH MY STINKY BUTT HAND!”

While I am stunned by the impossible sight before me and floored by the continuing series of the worst possible sentences to be spoken in the English language, I feel a sudden pang of reassurance, a zen-like calm settling upon me. The sight of a rabid magician Daniel Radcliffe with a hand protruding from his asshole is not, in concept itself, comforting to me. However, the reality of the situation has become clear.

I am high. In fact, I am tripping out of my mind. And I know exactly who to blame.

Will.

Will had spotted me some weed, which I had smoked in a joint as my pre-shift ritual. He must have given me weed laced with something. Will’s well-known in town for his misadventures while high on LSD, DMT, ketamine, cough syrup, or anything else he can get his hands on. I’ve ended up as an unwitting accomplice on these adventures, the last one ending with the both of us dressed in speedos, wearing pirate hats and eye patches, all while sailing a mattress with a weed wacker motor in circles around the town fountain. Will kept yelling “surrender the booty” while blasting the most well-respected and beautifully crafted song of the early 2000s from his phone, “Ms. New Booty,” by the poet and philosopher Bubba SparXXX.

We ended up in jail for the night and paid a couple hundred dollars in fines. Will said it was well worth it. I swore off tripping for life.

Until now.

“I don’t have time for this, Mr. Silverpasture.” This stops him in his tracks.

“Time? All time revolves around the splendor of…”

“…the almighty butt hand. Yes, I get it. It’s stinky. It wants to touch me. Blah, blah, blah. I have to go to work and punch my best friend in the face. Can you, like, retreat to the recesses of my subconscious or something?”

“Wait, you are not cowering in fear in the face of the—”

“I don’t give a damn about your stinky hand!” I stomp toward J-Mart and a fate somehow worse than an interdimensional stinky caress.

“Wait, wait!” Daniel shouts. He scoot-hops toward me. “It’s stuck! I can’t retrieve my hand!” He tugs, but his anus holds as tight as a bear trap.

“Uhh… you want me to help you?”

“Imagine the largest dump you’ve ever taken, splitting your folds from the inside, only to be lodged, the pressure mounting like Krakatoa on the verge of erupting.”

“Gross. Stop. Please. You’re not even real. Just blip out of existence.”

“Have you no heart?” He scoots closer. “Please just grasp my butt hand. Push and pull it, floss it free.” He draws the hand back like a cobra ready to strike.

“Don’t follow me or I’ll call the cops. On second thought, they’d just arrest me for talking to myself and send me to the mental hospital.” I storm away from the vivid hallucination.

Daniel laughs. “I’m way more depressed than you’ll ever be, loser! I bet you don’t hate yourself as much as I do.”

I stop in my tracks. “What?”

“I can punch myself in the balls harder than you ever could!” he taunts. “And my balls are wayyyy smaller than yours! I piss my pants much more frequently than you, goober!”

“Do you not understand how to make fun of someone?”

“Guess who’s going to lick every sock in your sock drawer and cry to emo music while you’re at work? THIS GUY!” His butt hand curls and points its thumb back up at himself.

“I’m not going to, like, fight you over those words or get touched by your stinky hand. Don’t follow me into work.”

“You know nothing of butt hand’s power!” Daniel shouts. “You shall fist tickle my butt knuckle! It has been foreseen!”

“If you’ve seen that, then clear your browser history, bro.”

Daniel laughs madly. “Enjoy your freedom while you can, for the reign of the almighty butt hand is upon you!”

Daniel still scoots in my direction, but I reach J-Mart and step inside with one thought in mind.

Glad that’s over.

**CHAPTER 2: THE NEFARIOUS NUT BUTTER GARGLER**

A scattered horde of zombies lumbers throughout J-Mart, their eyes glossy, glazed over, and dead. Their mouths hang open, caked with drool, and their slipper-laden feet barely summon the energy to drag themselves across the shiny yet somehow filthy floors. The creatures move without intent or reason, their faces hollow caricatures of human life; clammy, faded, and sagging. The corpse nearest to me stares blankly at the items in the *As Seen on TV* rack, as if he’s perplexed by the human process of boxing mostly useless cheaply made goods and selling them at a discount to temporarily make someone feel like they are getting a deal instead of a burden.

Okay, I exaggerated. J-Mart isn’t filled with actual zombies, but it is filled with the living dead. You know, zombies in the philosophical sense, broken people meandering around a store, spending money they don’t have, not sure what they want and never finding it, seeking that moment of control in a life spiraling out of it by buying another box of frozen pizza bagels to binge eat their anxiety away. They are the type of zombies who don’t know they’re ensnared by a social, political, and economic system which pretends to empower them while using psychological manipulation and physical addiction to continually drain them of their cash and lifeblood.

Like most of us.

The man closest to me truly is puzzled by the display of *As Seen on TV* products. He’s holding the box for the ab belt which shocks your stomach repeatedly to cause muscle contractions and therefore…somehow lose weight? It’s the type of thing that must have originally been conceived to torture inmates at Guantanomo Bay but they found a way to slap a new label on it and make some cash. The product is uniquely American in the way it creates the problem of self-hatred and promises to solve it through suffering and physical punishment.

There are probably ten or so customers in sight, all wandering aimlessly, many here simply to pass the time. The movie theater just went out of business, meaning the closest cinema is forty miles away in Scranton. No playhouse, no art gallery, no adult recreation leagues, no public transportation, just not enough people or resources to support these types of things. So what’s there to do? Hang out with buddies at gas stations or walk around the few stores still left open. Sometimes Will and I use his paintball gun to splatter the crotches of statues or hit golf balls from the hill overlooking town at the police station, but these events only occur when we can afford enough booze to make it entertaining.

I notice Dio, the only other cashier on duty, playing Super Soda Saga on his phone at his vacant checkout station. Dio sank a few thousand dollars into microtransactions, which is considerably more money than his negative net worth. We’ve tried to talk to him about this type of thing, but he says it’s his only source of happiness and that everyone should let him be. He mumbled something about being in the top one thousand world wide and how he’s never come close to accomplishing anything like that.

Dio has the unfortunate reality of being named after Ronnie James Dio, the 80s goth rocker, due to his parents using his bat-like screeches as an aphrodisiac, conceiving Dio and each of his siblings to his music. Dio has siblings named Ronnie, James, Gypsy, Angel, Egypt, Rainbow, and Holy Diver, which sounds like the most unfortunate of the names, but it’s actually worse for Dio himself.

His last name is Durant.

Dio Durant, who also happens to have particularly strong body odor, has lived with the same grade school jokes about his name daily for his entire life. Add in the reality that his mother drank just enough while pregnant to cause him developmental delays but not enough for him to officially suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, and you have the recipe for someone vulnerable yet capable enough to be an ideal target for bullies. All things considered, I stopped bringing up Dio’s app addiction, he’s probably right about it being the only thing that makes him happy.

This town is full of dicks.

Literally.

What I mean is Dio and his family aren’t the only ones with odd names around here. I know a Dick Savage, a Dick Wacker, a Dick Ball, a Dick Ryder, and a Dick Butz. These names, mind you, are by choice, either from the parents or from the guy himself, but this type of stuff is so common and saturated around Rosedale, Pennsylvania that no one bats an eye.

This book is about a grand fight for the fate of every strand of reality and I kid you not, this fucking town is the primary setting.

Not far from Dio is Shelly, the floor manager, a rigid stick of a woman, tiny but imposing, her hawk-like eyes always present to the moment while her mind simultaneously remembering every single fuck up you’ve ever made while on the job. Not that I blame her, honestly with what she has to deal with.

Shelly has the unfortunate responsibility of corralling Will, who delights in finding the creepiest dolls in the toy aisle and hiding them inside other products and giggles at his imagined reaction of the new owner’s thinking they’ve bought furniture which comes with a cursed toy. Will also organizes impromptu games of kickball and laser tag with kids in the store, sings while playing a toy ukulele over the intercom system, and has houses the homeless in our outdoor section. If it were up to Shelly, Will would be out of a job, but she knows it’ll take months to find someone else to take the job, if that even happens at all.

I walk to my checkout station and prepare to turn the light on, letting the dissatisfied customers know I’m ready to scan their items and become the object of their ire. My role is an important one, I am to stand at my station and greet all customers, make them feel much more important and empowered than they are, listen to every single one of their complaints, nod along empathetically and get my manager to settle their problem with a dollar off coupon. It is a delicate social dance for which I am paid nine dollars an hour, much more than the majority of workers earn in town.

Will wanders over to me. Instead of his standard J-Mart shirt he’s wearing a black graphic t-shirt bearing the image of a cat playing an electric guitar while surfing on a slice of pizza through the center of the galaxy. His stringy blond hair flows from his face in a way where you aren’t sure if the greasy style and texture are intentional or if he just hasn’t showered in days. He’s thin and lanky but “built like a gecko” in his own words, with a disproportionately long torso that makes finding fitting jeans difficult. His solution has been to buy jeans that fit his waist size and use a pair of scissors to cut jagged hunks off the bottom of each pant leg. This reveals his ankle tattoo which is simply the word “ankle.”

“Pancakes and poor life choices?” Will asks, the distinct odor of orange soda wafting off his breath.

“Excuse me?”

“Ice cream and debauchery?”

“Is this a bit?”

“Cigar and a soiree?”

“I’m going to punch you in the face.”

Will laughs and slaps my shoulder. “Chill, Liam. I’m just asking what you want to do tonight.”

“I want to punch you in the face.”

“What crawled up your ass?”

“It’s what popped out of someone else’s ass that’s bothering me.”

Will leans forward, clearly interested now. “Describe. Shape. Size. Texture. Flavor. I probably can tell you synthetic or natural material, country of origin, legal status, and which sex shop it came from.”

“A hobo in a magician’s costume accosted me while sticking his hand out of his ass.”

Will pulls a pipe out of his jeans pocket and puts it between his lips. He strokes the scruffy patch of hair on his chin while striking a contemplative pose. If this sounds bizarre then you don’t know Will, his pockets are loaded with props and paraphernalia of all kinds. “You said *out* of his ass? Very unusual. Typically we can only shove hands *into* our asses. See most people start with the full fist but to truly be successful the key is to do that Italian chef thing with your fingers where you pinch and bundle them tight like you're about to say ‘that’s-a-spicy-meat-a-ball’ and then…”

I slap the pipe out of his mouth. “Stop it. This is all your fault.”

“My fault? Are you sure it wasn’t Lester the Molester?”

Lester the Molester is a folk hero of sorts.

This seems strange to say.

Lester never molested anyone to my knowledge, but the name was a cruel moniker given to him by locals. Lester was a middle-aged man, unkempt and unassuming, with a longstanding history of mental illness. The guy needed some help but instead of giving it to him the town built a series of salacious rumors about him and egged on his odd behavior.

I should get to the point.

Lester likes to pee in odd places.

Well, I guess not *so* odd. Plenty of animals and even people pee on cars and storefronts, but for whatever reason, Lester *had* to do this in front of other people. The incidents were isolated at first, spread out by months of times, but like a serial offender they soon began happening more frequently. First, he was spotted pissing on the grocery store, grinning and giggling as he released the pressure. Next, he popped out of an alleyway and drew a line in the sidewalk no pedestrians dare cross. He doused the door of Nick Losinno’s sedan as he stood screaming at him from his porch and went a step further by trying to pee on Karl Olsheski’s shoes as he stood waiting at a traffic crossing.

No one really knew who Lester was back then. The paper shared the stories like they were a part of some urban legend, and everyone around town was on the lookout for the “phantom pisser” roaming the streets of Rosedale, waiting for his next opportunity to strike. A local printing shop made t-shirts geared towards tourists. “I survived the spray in Rosedale, PA.”

The shop went out of business, for what that’s worth.

Suddenly, people had a scapegoat. A reason to talk shit on the town without having to mention their own personal failings or lack of an attempt to leave it. Lester was the hero Rosedale deserved more so than it needed, one that allowed residents to laugh at and hate themselves without being aware of it.

Lester was fined a couple of times, spent a week in county jail, but was always thrown back onto the streets. He had nowhere to go and no one was really keen on helping him. It wasn’t until the “downtown brown” incident of two years ago that Lester was looked at as a real problem. This was when he shat a load so huge upon the floor of the laundromat, the owner was convinced it came from a diarrhea-stricken stray dog. Security footage revealed the truth. Lester, grinning like a rosy-cheeked child on Christmas day, had waltzed into the laundromat in a calculated strike, and, in all of his glory, laid his goliath dookie right center in the floor, never once breaking stare with the security camera.

I forget what happened to Lester after that incident, but he was “sent away,” whatever that means. Some optimists in town believe he is finally getting the help he’s always needed, while others, who also fashion themselves as optimists, perpetuate the story that Lester is still out there, mysterious and elusive, pissing freely like a sasquatch with a bladder problem.

Some mysteries are best left unsolved.

“It wasn’t Lester,” I say. “It was a meth-addicted version of Daniel Radcliffe and his hand was sticking out of his ass, like a wormhole or something.”

“I believe the proper term is cornhole.”

“What’s wrong with you? I know I only saw that shit because the weed you gave me was laced with something. What was it?”

Will’s face goes from playful to serious in a flash, the sight so sudden it’s almost disconcerting. “Whoa, dude, I didn’t give you anything like that. After the fountain incident I wouldn’t just…”

“Bullshit! I smoked a joint and then saw a butt hand man jump out of the shadows of a ruined child’s entertainment casino. He tried to insult me by talking about how small his balls were and the only reason…”

“AHEM!” Shelly, our manager, stands before us with her arms crossed.

“Oh shit!” Will says. “Liam didn’t mean what he said about the ass finger man and he definitely didn’t mean to disparage Charles Cheddar’s. All hail the cheese rat, right? You were such a good manager there.” He pauses. “But uh, if this has anything to do with what I stuck inside that roll of paper towels, I’ll have you know…”

“Enough!” Shelly belts. “I don’t care what you two morons blather on about. Most of the time it doesn’t make a difference but I’d appreciate it if you didn’t do it while we have customers in the store. We can’t lose business to your idiocy or foul language. Got it?”

“Yes ma’am!” Will says, saluting her.

“Go break the boxes down in the back and throw them in the compactor,” Shelly says. “And take that ridiculous shirt off while you’re at it.”

“Yes ma’am!” Will repeats, twirling on his heels before heading toward the back of the store.

“I’m sorry, Shelly.”

Shelly shakes her head. She isn’t as pissed as she is disappointed and this cuts deep. Shelly’s the type of person who will never move on from this town and will hang onto the modicum of power she has in her twelve dollar an hour supervisor position until her cigarette habit puts in the grave sometime in her sixties. She’ll never retire and she’s never been delusional enough to dream of it. Somehow, someone stuck in this type of position being disappointed in me stings more than anything.

“He’s a bad influence and you know it.” She shakes her head before walking off.

I sigh. Will’s a bad influence in the way having a beer after every work shift is bad for your health. Of course it isn’t the best approach but sometimes it’s the only relief you have. And what’s the point of moving on anyway? Grow to the point where I move on from this town, leaving all the people I know and care about? Become polished and professional so that I don’t fit in with my friends and family while also failing to fit in with the professional class, who can smell my poor and traumatic roots a mile away? If I’m going to be laden with stress and anxiety I’d much rather be miserable with company than isolated, so I figure Will is just the type of friend…

“I WILL GARGLE YOUR NUT BUTTER!”

“....Excuse me?”

“I SHALL GARGLE EVERY DROP OF YOUR SAVORY NUT BUTTER! I SHALL BASTE MYSELF IN ITS GRITTY ESSENCE!”

I look toward the lunatic spewing these words and somehow see the most insane sight of the day. 

Danny DeVito, the squat actor from that sitcom *It Often Drizzles in Weehawken,* stands before me wearing absolutely nothing except a pair of jean shorts so small that he looks like a sausage bursting forth from its casing. Smeared across the flabs of his mostly naked body are various nut butters, the open jars of which sit in the cart next to him. Globs of sunflower, almond, cashew, and peanut butter cake around his lips, running down his face in slowly listing rivers of drool. In his left hand he holds a turkey baster fully loaded with peanut butter. With a pinch he sends an arc spraying through the air, his bloated tongue lashing from between his lips in an attempt to catch the stray globules. 

“You are not real,” I mutter. “I am still high. Or I have a brain tumor or something. Why is something like you buried in my subconscious?” 

“You can ignore your fate no longer,” DeVito hisses. “I have collected your precious nut butter and I have gargled them most verily. I am victorious.” 

“Is that a fetish or something or…” 

“I drink the lifeblood of enemies per the orders of Lekreshi, Snake God of the Black Sun. Here I consume the lifeblood of Gobhordox the Mighty, proving that he is no infallible being, showing that you should have no faith in him!” 

“Is this larping or something? Do I roll a D20 to see how effectively I can punch you in the fucking mouth?” I flick on my checkout station light to call for the manager. I don’t actually cognitively think that will do anything but it’s a Pavlovian response to being harassed as a retail worker for years on end. The blinking light startles Danny DeVito, who stares at it as if entranced. 

“The signals are upon us. The realms shall merge. All shall fall into oblivion just as Legion the Unbeing has demanded.” 

“My manager is going to slap the shit out of you. Or me, honestly. Maybe I deserve it for projecting you from the inner recesses of my mind.” 

DeVito cranks his head back to an impossible angle, the bones in his neck audibly churning with the effort. He opens his mouth wider than a mouth should go, his jaw popping as if he’s dislocating it. From the deep void of his maw rattles out a perverse sound of the abyss - a guttural resonant groan which morphs into a twisted version of a 90s song I know.  

“I….WANT…SOMETHING….ELSE…” 

“Uhhh what?”  

“TO….GET…ME…THROUGH…THIS….” 

“You have to be kidding me…”

DeVito snaps his head down with ferocity and looks at me with a penetrating snarl. He growls out the final words like a spite-ridden curse which will forever sully my tortured soul. “SEMI-CHARMED KIND OF LIFE, BABY!” He opens his mouth again, jaw far too extended, and that’s when Daniel the meth addict magician joins the party. 

Daniel saunters up to the checkout station, his hand fully retrieved from the recesses of his cosmically infinite anus. He appraises what DeVito is up to and something clicks in his eyes, like this was part of the plan the entire time. Daniel spins around and bends over, placing a hand on both butt cheeks. “MY THIRD EYE IS NO LONGER BLIND!” he cries as he spreads his asshole wide open. 

A tangle of twisted black as night tentacles launch forth from his asshole like he’s shitting out Cthulhu. 

I seriously warned you about this book. 

The demented menagerie shoots forth like an ancient kraken emerging from the infinite depths. There are more slick tentacles than I can count, whipping through the air without rhyme or reason, growing longer by the moment, extending forth from Daniel Radcliffe’s hot pocket from corners of the cosmos unknown. Danny DeVito retches the same foul tentacles from his gullet like he’s vomiting Satan’s spaghetti. 

    Countless generations of human evolution have ingrained in me a natural response to life or death stressors. Through survival of the fittest, the genes given to me have equipped my mind with automatic and subconscious processes to defend against monstrous assailants. In the modern world, these complex reflexes are seldom called upon, our mind’s true potency lying dormant, but now is the time and the moment to unlock my biological superpower. My brain processes the happenings without my knowledge, before I even fully make sense of what is happening, and then I am in motion. 
    
    I grab a roll of dimes off the cash register and throw them at Danny DeVito. They hit him in the eye and it does nothing besides make him say “ouch.” 

“What the hell is this?” Shelly asks, running over. She barely sees or understands what is before her but her own ingrained managerial instincts take over. She rushes to confront DeVito but fails to see Daniel Silverpasture lurking behind her. 

“Shelly, run!”

Daniel’s appendages wrap around Shelly’s limbs like a hoard of starved serpents. They raise her as effortlessly as if she were a doll and lap at her skin like countless hungry tongues tasting their meal. Shelly belts out a series of cries and thrashes against her restraints but she’s no match for the wiry strength of the impossibly long tentacles. They each find a spare patch of skin and burrow it like worms into wet soil. 

*Wiggle, wiggle, slicch, slicch.* 

The desperation and agony of Shelly’s screams are sounds forever etched into my nightmares. Color instantly flees her body, the tentacles pulsating as they guzzle every ounce of blood. She shrivels up like a juice pouch slurped empty, her skin listless, saggy, and hanging off the bone. Her eyes lazily roll out of her skull, hanging to either side and making her look like some type of macabre Halloween decoration. The tentacles lose interest once she’s sucked dry and drop her withered sack of a corpse to the floor. 

Alarms blare throughout the store. Piercing yet thunderous, they crash in cadence with the flashing of blue overhead lights, emergency alert and alarm protocols full in effect. Soon the automatic doors will snap shut, a call will go directly to the police, and the entrance to the emergency bunker will unlock. The alarms remind the employees to enact the crisis protocol and…

Oh, wait, no, it’s just the alert for the Blue Light Special, a random twenty minute period where select items in the store are offered at extra low prices. The alarm is meant to excite and entice customers to flock over to the chosen aisles to spend their money. There’s probably some metaphor to be written about how Shelly the corporate big-box floor manager had her lifeblood sucked from her and her body discarded while the Blue Light Special alarms fearlessly blared on, the sound likely the last ones she ever heard, but I’m not a talented enough writer to craft it. 

Whether from the horror of Shelly’s death or the promise of great bargains, the customers shriek and run about the store. I have a moment where time slows down, not only because of the abject horror of what I have just witnessed, but also the dawning realization of it all being real crashing through my psyche like a sledgehammer to the skull. 

DeVito spreads his tentacles forth in a menacing net, ready to exsanguinate me. My mind can process the images but not the reality and I’m stuck frozen like a computer where the owner has continually clicked “remind me later” when it badgered them to do an update. I am saved perhaps by fate, perhaps by beings and circumstances beyond my comprehension, or perhaps simply by an angelic hero who has secretly been the best of us all along. 

“Stay away from Liam!” Dio Durant shouts as he fearlessly jumps upon the back of my would-be assailant. He places DeVito in a chokehold he undoubtedly saw while watching professional wrestling which unfortunately seems to have no effect. 

The threat of another innocent death kicks me into gear. I summon Herculean strength to effortlessly rip my cash register from its stand and snap the wires holding it in place. I hold it over my head like an action hero ready to deliver the fatal blow to the villian. I toss the register at DeVito’s sweaty meatball of a head only to have his mouth-tentacles slap the tool of capitalism to the floor. It smashes and a flurry of livelihood and freedom scatter across the floor like green confetti. 

“Leave my best friend alone!” Dio shouts, squeezing DeVito’s toad-like neck with every ounce of energy he can muster. I’m not sure what is more tragic, the fact that the nice but sad guy I share a few sentences with every few days thinks we are best friends or the horrid fate which is about to befall him. 

Okay, spoiler alert; it’s what happens to him. 

Two of DeVito’s nut paste caked tentacles arch back from his dripping maw and burrow into Dio’s eyes like worms entering wet soil. They drain the contents of his skull in a disgusting series of hefty slurps, cutting his scream off before it starts like the air suddenly let out of a balloon. They whip forward with enough strength to rip Dio’s head from his body with a resounding pop. The blood-spurting head tumbles end over end through the store like a desperation hail mary pass, landing somewhere in the outdoor section. Dio’s corpse crumbles to the floor between DeVito and Daniel, whose tentacles writhe in pleasure while the fiends celebrate. 

“Doo, doo, doo, doo doo-doo doo,” they chant to the tune of *Semi-Charmed Kind of Life* while doing a white guy wiggle dance around Dio’s pooling blood. Their tentacles wave in the air along with their motions. 

What. The. Fuck. 

“COWABUNGA MOTHERFUCKERS!” 

Will flies into the scene riding a razor scooter and wearing a Chewbacca mask. He wields a nail gun in one hand and a shovel across his back. Will jumps off the scooter, which clatters over Shelly’s dead body. 

“How was my entrance?” Will shouts. “Because I think I nailed it!” Will then shoots Danny DeVito in the dick with a nail gun three times. 

“I WANT SOMETHING ELSE!” DeVito cries, falling to his knees, tentacles going limper than an all male retirement community orgy. 

“GOODBYE!” Will screams as he shoots Devito in the head, a nail landing squarely between his eyes. This knocks the beast to the floor. 

“And now for my next trick,” Daniel Silverpasture says, “I shall make your lives disappear!” He draws his ass-tentacles into attack position like a series of scorpion tails ready to strike. 

“That line sucks bro!” Will pulls the shovel from his back, twirls, and launches it at Daniel’s dick. His aim is true, having practiced this technique for years on mannequins he stole from J-Mart’s dumpsters, and the head of the shovel hits Daniel squarely between the legs. Will presses the side of his mask, which lets out a victorious electronic Wookie roar as he shouts, “Can you DIG it, sucka?!” 

“Doo….doo….doo…” Daniel huffs, both hands covering his crotch as he sags to the floor, tentacles falling with him. 

Will stumbles over Shelly’s shell of corpse as he needlessly retrieves the child-sized scooter. He remounts it and turns to me. “Toot, too, toot, time to scoot, scoot, scoot!” 

“Just run you idiot!” I sprint past him. We reach the door and I make the mistake of glancing back to survey the chaos. 

“I….like….girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch…” DeVito rasps, rising to his feet. His jean shorts hug his body even more tightly now that they are nailed to his crotch. Boils cover every visible inch of his nut-basted flesh, and there’s something *inside* each one of them. 

Something *wiggling.* 

They look like worms, or a smaller version of the tentacles. And honestly, I’d had my fill of tentacles for the day. It was indeed time to scoot. 

“I’d take her if I had one wish,” DeVito grunts. “But she’s been gone since that summer.” He pauses and his eyes shoot to us, resolute with as much purpose as they are malevolence. 

“Since that summer,” DeVito snarls. 

“That song blows, bro!” Will says before pressing his Chewbacca mask, letting out another valiant electronic cry before riding off on his silver steed into the night. 

I scramble after him and into the cool evening air, the calamity behind us just a mere taste of the horror to come.

Preview of chapter 3....

**CHAPTER 3: THE DIPPIN’ DEEZ NUTS DEBACLE** 

“We have to get to Dippin’ Deez Nuts!” Will shouts as we race across the parking lot. 

“What?” 

“America runs on blumpkin!” 

“Are you having a stroke?” 

“You know, Blumpkin Blow Nuts, the coffee and donut place!” 

“Its name is…” 

“Drippin’ Dog Nuts? Drunken Do Nots?”

“No dude!” 

“Disturbing DOGE cuts? Defecating Dreadnaughts?”

“No it’s…” 

“Dapper Doll Parts!” Will collides with my car and spills his ass over the hood. His Chewbacca mask lets out another cry, this one of defeat. It flies from his face, scatters across the pavement, and leaves our fable for good.",1,1770075641.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I used to live in London for a while. When I lived there, my friend visited me and stayed for three weeks. While it was a lot of fun, it was also kind of exhausting to share my room with her, because I was so used to living on my own.

Now I’m planning to go back to London for ten days. I want to stay in a nice area, and while I’m there I want to see some friends and just do chill stuff, like going to my favourite coffee places, shopping, and walking in my favourite parks.

Now my friend wants to go with me. At first, I was like, I want to do this on my own. But now I’m convinced that it could be fun together. She asked me if we could stay with one of my friends there, and I don’t want that because they live with other flatmates and I don’t think they can host two people. So I told her that I’m not going to ask that, and that I want to stay in an Airbnb or a hotel.

Now she is looking for different options like couchsurfing, but I don’t want to do that. I want to go to a decent, nice place just to chill and relax. Our salaries are similar, and I think that we can both afford to share a hotel room in London. I told her that if she can’t come because of the cost of the room, that’s okay, but I still want to go and rent a room on my own.

Now she asked me if she could stay at my hotel room because there would be space for another person anyway. but she will not pay, how would you guys respond?",1,1770075479.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

I woke up to the smell of smoke. I fell asleep choking on the constant fucking stink of nicotine and tar. It wasn’t just in my lungs, suffocating every room, a plume I was sure was going to give me permanent lung damage. It was ingrained into my clothes, my skin, my hair.

I felt disgusting, even after showering and scrubbing my skin until it was raw.

My backpack and books stunk of smoke, and in every class at least one person gave me the side eye. My papers were tinted yellow from sitting on the coffee table for days, surrounded by my chain-smoking roomies.

It was disgusting.

My fifty-something-year-old parents were heavy smokers. Their generation grew up with it.

My roommates were nineteen years old. Gen Z.

Their smoking habits were going to fucking kill them.

Not vapes, either. Cigarettes. The lung-cancer kind. Fifty a day, each. I counted.

They didn’t cough once. Didn’t croak once.

Meanwhile, I was suffocating through every day, diagnosed with three respiratory infections, provided with three inhalers, and given a stern warning from my doctor:

“Get out of that house.”

It wasn’t just annoying. It was destroying my health.

Every conversation was spoken with a cigarette delicately curved between their lips, like it was home. Each drag blew smoke straight into my face. I opened the windows. They shut them. I tried to prop open the door to air the place out and was promptly reprimanded.

So I was going to leave.

I’d already planned what I was going to say.

But I was also worried for their health. They needed help. They needed an intervention. A way to get them away from cigarettes.

So I made a plan.

I drove home from class as usual.

My car stunk of smoke.

I’d told Aurelia multiple times not to smoke while I was driving, and yet I was staring at my passenger seat, covered in cigarette burns. The thick stink of nicotine hung in the air, twisting my gut. I cracked the window, grateful for the bitter breeze.

“Sam, are you there?”

I forgot I was speaking to Felix. He’d spent half the call silent. I could hear him blowing out gentle drags through the speaker.

I snapped out of it, tightening my grip on my phone.

“Yeah. I’m almost home. About five minutes away.”

No response.

Just Felix breathing ambience.

I bit my lip. “Are you smoking?”

I couldn’t even hide the bitterness in my tone.

“Mm. Is that a problem, babe?” Felix teased. He laughed, exhaling.

I never questioned his habit. Never tried to stop it. I just let him. He was used to that. Used to blowing smoke in my face and expecting me to smile back while he smoked himself to death.

I could picture him leaning against the door, cigarette stuck between his lips.

“There’s a full moon out tonight,” he said. I could hear the smile in his voice. Another long drag. “It’s pretty.”

“Fascinating,” I muttered.

He laughed.

Felix was my best friend. I was a latecomer, moving in and joining the trio a year ago. Usually the cold shoulder worked on him.

Not this time. Not when cigarettes were involved.

Felix was a sweetheart. Chilled out. Joker type. He took pride in experimenting with his femininity.

But take his cigarettes away and he became someone else.

Flared nostrils. Glaring eyes. Petty attitude.

It was like living with a twelve-year-old.

“Have you ever heard of cancer?” I blurted, taking a left and narrowly missing a cat sitting in the middle of the road. “It’s a killer condition. You can get it from, you know…”

I side-eyed the yellowed passenger seat.

“Smoking fifty cigarettes a day.”

He surprised me with a loud, explosive laugh.

“Felix. I’m being serious. You’re going to hurt yourselves.”

“Mmmm.” He laughed again.

I bit back a yell.

“Felix!”

“Sorry,” he giggled. “Choked on my cigarette. Guess I’ll die then.”

By the time we reached our place, I parked up.

Craning my neck, I spotted him standing in the doorway, bathed in warm light, a plume of smoke curling around him. A fresh cigarette hung from his mouth as he stamped out the cinders of the last one.

Relentless. Endless.

One cigarette finished. Another already begun.

He was still in checker pyjamas, wearing my sweater, short blond hair tucked beneath the hood.

Felix grinned at me, his voice crackling through the speaker.

“You’re a riot, Sammy.”

I got out of the car and walked straight past him, immediately getting smoke in my face.

Felix blocked my way.

“Password,” he said, smirking, lips curled around the cigarette butt.

“Lung disease,” I muttered, shoving past him.

The house was already choked in smoke. I swallowed down a cough scratching my throat.

Roman was lounging in the kitchen, making dinner, a rollie caught between his lips. His thick red curls reminded me of embers. Ironic.

“Dinner’s in ten minutes,” he said, bouncing between the bubbling stove and the microwave. “Trying a new recipe I found on TikTok.”

His Irish accent was usually a comfort. Tonight, it was muffled by the goddamn cancer stick.

Aurelia sat in the lounge with her laptop, blonde bob bouncing as she typed, music blaring.

“Yooo.” She high-fived me.

I didn’t stop.

The front door slammed shut. Felix stepped back inside.

“Hey guys,” he called out, “did you know lung disease exists? Apparently we’re going to die.”

Roman smirked, checking the oven.

Aurelia chuckled.

I ran upstairs.

The air was cleaner up there. I opened every window, sticking my head out and dragging fresh air into my lungs.

Roman and Felix kept their cigarettes in their room.

So I grabbed the stash.

Dumped it in the bath.

Set fire to the lot.

They had to learn the hard way.

First step: remove addiction.

Second step?

Hide.

I rinsed out the tub, cracked the bathroom window, and retreated to my room to nap.

I don’t think an hour had passed before the thumping jolted me awake.

BANG.

BANG.

BANG.

Shit.

I cracked one eye open, drool soaking my pillow.

“Sam!”

I sat up, bones stiffening at the rasp in his voice.

I’d been expecting it.

“Sam, open the fucking door!”

What I hadn’t been expecting was his strength.

“Please!” Felix gasped sharply. “Sam!”

My gut twisted.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “It’s for your own good.”

His sudden snarl made me flinch.

“I can’t fucking breathe! Open the fucking door. Now.”

The door tore off its hinges.

Felix stood there, panting, lips blue, hands clawed around his throat. His eyes blazed. His nostrils flared.

Behind him, Roman and Aurelia lay unmoving on the floor.

Felix was fuming.

“Where.”

In two strides, he was in front of me.

His hand closed around my neck.

No.

They weren’t fingers.

They were too sharp. They sliced into my skin.

I noticed his arms. Mottled. Almost scaly.

“Are they—”

I had a spare pack in my pocket. A failsafe.

Before I could speak, Felix exhaled.

Smoke billowed from his nose.

“Do you know what carbon monoxide feels like?” he whispered. “It feels like nothing. Smells like fucking nothing.”

He laughed as fire crept across the skin of his arm.

“But Mom brought us back,” he murmured. “We were reborn. Through her.”

His grip tightened.

“Through her breath. That’s how we breathe, Sammy.”

His eyes shifted. Triangular.

He tipped his head back.

“Right, Mom?”

The floor rumbled.

The ceiling cracked open, orange light spilling through.

One eye appeared.

Then another.

Felix smiled.

Flames erupted from his nostrils.

“So,” he snarled.

In the upcomming year i'd like to dip my toes into hotels and travel content/high end work. I am admired by alot of stuff i see online and am telling myself i must buy the fx3 which i doubt is true. Got the gm 16-35 24-70 // - 85mm 1.8 and a tamron lens 100-400 incase that is relevant.   

Sony a7 V seems pricy as its new, could get a used fx3 fo that or two fx30 so im kinda lost atm. Defintly could use the a7 3 for stills and get a dedicated video camera, i think this is where this entire theat is headed torwards.   

Things I am looking forward to would be 10-bit and gyro-data stabilisation. Would enjoy the more fps in 4k as well as i am currently stuck at 25 i believe. So 4k 60/120 is a big upp.

1qubhbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1qubhbh/business/,Business,"She was already famous.
Not “known.” Not “popular.” Famous in the way where her name was a category, her face a brand, her voice something people recognized before they realized why. Platforms fought over her. Cameras followed her. Metrics bent around her.
But fame had a ceiling.
And she could feel it.
Being the best used to mean being desired. Then it meant being watched. Then it meant being talked about.
Now it meant something else entirely:
being unavoidable.
That’s when she called him.
He didn’t use his real name anymore. No one did, in his world. But she still called him by the one she used when they were younger, before fame, before systems, before she learned how to perform and he learned how to disappear.
They hadn’t spoken in years.
She found him anyway.
They always seemed to orbit back to each other.
They met somewhere deliberately forgettable. No cameras. No screens. Just stale air and coffee that tasted like regret.
“You look the same,” she said.
He smiled faintly. “You look like an interface.”
She laughed, but it landed sideways.
They talked business first. Infrastructure. Latency. Control. He asked what she wanted, not what she needed.
“I want to own the spotlight,” she said.
“You already do.”
She shook her head. “No. I lease it. From platforms. From trends. From moods. I want it baked into the system.”
That’s when he understood.
She wasn’t chasing fame anymore.
She was chasing power over attention itself.
Out of habit, out of memory, she tried to pull him closer. A smile that used to work. A line that once meant something.
He didn’t take it.
Not because he didn’t feel the echo —
but because he remembered her before the performance calcified.
He remembered her fear of being ordinary.
He remembered her asking, years ago, half-joking, half-terrified:
“If no one’s watching, am I still real?”
That question had built his whole life.
The plan was simple.
A global live event. Sponsored, mirrored, redundant. Fail-safes stacked on fail-safes. Nothing that hadn’t been done before.
Except for one thing.
For a fraction of a second, everything would go dark.
No feeds. No sound. No signal.
A controlled blink.
Then only one thing would come back.
Her.
Not hosted.
Not streamed.
Embedded.
Every screen, every device, every surface capable of light.
She wouldn’t be broadcasting.
She would be the broadcast.
The night arrived.
She went out with friends beforehand. Smiled for cameras. Let the world believe this was just another appearance.
Then the lights cut.
Half a heartbeat of absolute nothing.
Reality inhaled.
And when it exhaled, she was there.
No branding. No borders. Just her, rendered in impossible clarity, looking straight into the collective eye of the world.
The crowd froze before it roared.
Phones lifted. Voices cracked. People didn’t know whether to cheer or kneel or cry — only that they were seeing her, everywhere, all at once.
In her ear, his voice came through, steady and calm, like it always was when everything else was breaking:
“It’s your time.
Take it away.”
She spoke.
Not lines. Not script. Something truer — sharpened, curated, perfected in real time. Every fear became confession. Every desire became doctrine.
The system adjusted around her. No one could look away. No one could mute, skip, or scroll past.
She wasn’t famous anymore.
She was structural.
After that night, the world didn’t revert.
It reorganized.
Major events routed through her presence. Systems anchored to her image. Attention flowed where she stood.
She had won.
Months later, she was performing live.
Thousands in the room. Millions more everywhere else. The air was electric with the certainty that nothing could interrupt her now.
Mid-performance, the lights died.
A ripple of confusion moved through the crowd.
Her screens glitched — not violently, not threateningly — just enough to feel familiar.
A single window opened in her monitor.
No name. No trace.
Just text.
Hey.
Just stopping in to say hi.
I love you.
I’m proud of you.
I’m rooting for you.
Her breath caught — just for a moment.
Then the power snapped back on.
The music surged. The crowd erupted, unaware of what had passed through the system.
She smiled — not the polished one, not the persona — but something quieter, steadier.
And she stepped back into the spotlight she now commanded, knowing that somewhere beyond the network, beyond the noise, there was still one person watching not because he had to—
—but because he chose to.",0,1770074996.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,0.5,False

ADHD makes the daily grind brutal—starting tasks, consistent follow-through on admin/taxes/bookkeeping, resisting distractions, and turning ideas into action all hit executive function walls hard. Hyperfocus helps sometimes, but without strong external structure and real consequences, things slip way too easily.

I’m looking for a female accountability buddy in the 45-60ish range who’s equally serious about discipline and willing to go stricter than casual check-ins. Someone local to South Shore who wants real mutual accountability to force consistency—no fluff, no endless excuses.

Proposed setup (all customizable and agreed upon upfront):

•  Daily text check-ins (morning goals set together + evening proof of progress—no vague “tried my best” reports).

•  1-2 in-person meetups per week (coffee shop, park, or quiet spot in Quincy, Plymouth, Hingham area) to review what got done, what didn’t, and enforce consequences face-to-face.

•  Harsher punishments for misses: All consequences will be mutually agreed upon in advance—we’ll negotiate a personalized list of impactful, deterrent penalties that actually sting and motivate us both. Nothing happens without full consent from both sides, and we can adjust or veto anything that doesn’t feel right. Examples (to spark ideas—we pick what fits each of us):

	•  Financial: Donate $20–100 to a cause/charity one of us dislikes (or Venmo the other as penalty—screenshot proof required).

	•  Physical discomfort: Extended cold shower, prolonged plank/wall sit, or immediate workout set (scaled to ability).

	•  Time/privilege loss: 24–48 hour no-screens/social media blackout, or forced early wake-up/no late-night scrolling.

	•  Tedious tasks: Extra marathon of boring chores (e.g., deep cleaning or manual organizing).

	•  Social escalation: Anonymous public failure log (e.g., throwaway Reddit post detailing the miss), or confession to a pre-approved third party.

	•  ADHD-tailored: Task doubling (do double the next quota), ban on favorite distractions/hyperfocus indulgences, or forced reflection essay read aloud at meetup.

This is fully mutual: We both set goals, both enforce, both face the agreed-upon fire if we slip. I’m reliable for replies, committed long-term, and want a partner who thrives on structure and doesn’t mind (or even prefers) a no-nonsense, high-stakes dynamic with clear boundaries.

If you’re in a similar boat (work-from-home, productivity struggles, maybe ADHD or just need tough love), local-ish, and think harsher, mutually agreed consequences could actually help us both level up, DM me. Include:

•  Your age/location rough area

•  Main goals/struggles right now

•  What kinds of punishments would motivate/deter YOU most (and any hard limits)

Serious, no-drama replies only—let’s discuss boundaries, safe words/opt-outs if needed, and trial it for a week or two to see if it clicks.

1qubes4,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1qubes4/56_m4f_philly_suburb_but_willing_to_relocate/,56 [M4F] Philly Suburb (but willing to relocate) | Looking for someone to grow old with,"Hi All.  I am a 56-year old, amicably divorced man (with a 29-year old daughter who lives on her own) looking for a long-term partner.  I am bright and well-educated, I'm intellectually curious, and I have a wide variety of interests.  I'm also the type of person who generally becomes interested in the things that my partner is interested in.

I work for myself, exclusively from home, so my schedule is quite flexible, and, while I'm not wealthy, I make a decent living.  The majority of my free time is spent listening to podcasts, exercising, watching sports, watching film/TV, or hiking (day trips -- I am not much of a camper).  I love music and have sung in a large number of choirs/ensembles through the years, but I am not currently singing with any groups.

I am an introvert, but I am very socially able.  People who have just met me are almost always surprised that I describe myself as an introvert, because I am confident and outgoing in social situations.  I call myself an introvert because I prefer to spend time alone or in small groups.  I don't need a fellow introvert as a partner, as long as said partner isn't a social butterfly; I am fine doing social things 2-3 times per week -- I just require time to recharge after a social outing.

I am very progressive, both on social issues and fiscal/governmental issues, and my politics are very important to me.  Having said that, I don't need a partner who is willing to discuss politics with me (though that would be optimal); any potential partner would, however, need to lean pretty strongly to the left or we simply won't see eye-to-eye on most important issues.  I am also an atheist.  I am not anti-religion, but it's unlikely that I would be compatible with someone who has strong religious beliefs.

I am a VERY open person -- I am happy to discuss anything about my life (current or past), as I have nothing to hide (even though I've made my fair share of mistakes).  I recognize the importance of both open communication and mutual respect.  I have strong opinions and I have no trouble expressing them, but I don't mind if  people disagree with me (unless their position has no basis in fact/reason).  I am a control freak with respect to MYSELF, but I have no interest in controlling others.  I am witty and ""punny"", I have a good sense of humor, and I have no trouble being laughed AT.  I am studious and can be very serious when the situation requires it, but I can also be a complete goofball (and, honestly, I am goofy far more often than I am serious)

Following are some facts/qualities that make me somewhat unusual (other than the length of this post):

I was an elite distance runner in HS and hoped to run for the US Olympic Team (which did not happen); I have never had an alcoholic beverage or tried any recreational drugs (I am fine with having a partner who drinks responsibly, but smoking or recreational drugs are dealbreakers); I am an incredibly picky eater -- I eat like 10 things in a ""rotation"" (so I am the polar opposite of a ""foodie"", and I spend as little time cooking as possible); I have had more surgeries than I have fingers (and I have the usual number of fingers); I have never had a cup of coffee (I don't care for the smell, and taste is 75% to 95% smell); I got perfect scores on the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT (but I am not pretentious or condescending in the least); I have had a wide variety of jobs, from bartender to sports writer to actuary to professional poker player; and I am still a very good athlete, especially at racquet sports (so I can probably help you if you aspire to become a competitive pickleball player).

My current reading list is dominated by books about neuroscience, scientific advancements, and chemistry (I am teaching myself the AP Chemistry curriculum in the hope of teaching it before long).  Some of my favorite recent shows are: ""Silo"", ""Severance"", ""Ted Lasso"", and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" (though I am not Jewish).  I like most movie genres, but tend to watch action movies, rom-coms, or comedies these days -- there is so much sad stuff going on in the world that I tend to prefer feel-good movies/TV.  I don't watch any ""reality TV"" (though I did watch a few seasons of ""American Idol"" and like 10 seasons of ""So You Think You Can Dance""), but I'm fine with a potential partner who does -- I don't think that ALL of a pairs' hobbies must be shared.

I am looking for a bright, intellectually curious, mature woman age 35+ who is left-leaning (at a minimum), physically active, and would like to find an equal/partner.  I would like to find someone who has opinions of her own to talk about life and share experiences WITH.  I am hoping to connect via chat/message while we make sure there is common ground and the appropriate ""chemistry"", after which we can move on from Reddit.

Finally, here are couple of recent photos of me:

i wish i had coffee to give away, but i hope the rest of you still playing get to enjoy what’s left of the app. ",12,1770074566.0,statusAI,1,0.88,False

I'm 28 years old, married and I am looking for some female friends/another couple in Stuttgart.

  
I'm transitioning since around a year now and my friend group before that was mainly men, so it's a bit difficult currently to really find proper connections to them.

  
Not looking for anything specific,maybe there's another queer couple in our age, that also looks for some friends? :)

  
Interests are: rock climbing, anime, a bit of gaming, coffee, good food

  
Not really a party person. I'd rather have us watch the extended version of Lord of the rings together or play some board games.",3,1770074548.0,stuttgart,1,0.57,False

1qub94f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1qub94f/peeing_and_pooping_in_the_house/,Peeing and pooping in the house,"I have a 5-6 year old healthy female dog who has recently been going to the bathroom in the house under the coffee table. She otherwise has been house broken with no issues (since July) no changes in routine, no separation anxiety, she just had an accident a couple weeks ago and now seems to have made a habit of it. (3-4 times weekly now) Gets taken out plenty and most of the time will at least pee before we leave for the day if not poop too in the morning. The only thing that has changed are the frigid temps. It’s been consistently under 20. Doesn’t seem to bother her, she would rather limp farther away from the house to smell things than go back into the warm house so I really don’t think it’s cause it’s too cold to use the bathroom outside. However this limits the amount of outside time she gets and we live above someone so blowing off steam in an old house with thin walls and floors isn’t an option lol. She does get easily distracted (our late dog did this too and I swear it’s him possessing her 😂) so my only thought is she thinks we only ever go for walks for the hell of it not to use the bathroom. If I walk to the streetlight across the street and stand there waiting for her to go she just looks at me like I’m stupid. (I tried making her earn the long walk by going the bathroom first thing across the street before the walk and turning around and going back inside if she does nothing, but she didn’t connect the dots lol. We don’t have a yard so she has to be on leash but I’m at such a loss right now. Hoping when it finally warms up in April 🫠 this will be a thing of the past.  Does anyone have any thoughts?",1,1770074429.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False
