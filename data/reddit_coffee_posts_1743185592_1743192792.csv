Find his channel and reviews here:
 https://youtube.com/@mikekreischerreviews3420?feature=shared

My view of this ration may be tainted a bit since I enjoyed it in Texas while on vacation and enjoying beautiful scenery all around me!

This was a new country for me, 17 total now!

This ration has a best by date of 2021, so 4 years past at this point. To be honest, I was worried it may not be ok given the similarity in some components to Russian items.

Upon opening my fears disappeared as there were no rancid aromas at all, just smelled like a plastic bag which is perfectly fine in our hobby!

The bag contained 3 smaller clear bags with each meal being self contained. See pics 3-6 for each meal contents.

Pic 7 shows the veg caviar stuff which was the only component I did not eat because the tin it was in was pretty bloated. It smelled nice, exactly like salsa in my opinion!

There were 3 black tea bags and plenty of sugar. I drank all 3 teas using my tried and true method, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp sugar, and allow to sit overnight in the fridge. Made 3 wonderful milk teas with great black tea flavor! I make all my coffees this way too; note, this ration had no coffee. That tea on the 3rd meal Pic is the same as the other 2, the tea bag packaging was black on one side and silver on the other for some reason.

Pic 8 shows a biscuit with some of the apple jam. Those biscuits and that jam were great! Reminded me very much of the Russian apple jam. The biscuits were neutral in flavor, which was great because they can be used with pretty much anything that way. No staleness detected at all.

Pic 9 is breakfast. It was Millet with Beef. The millet seemed to taste sort of like corn meal but far softer. I fried this stuff and then mixed with busted up biscuits, hearty and flavorful with no salt needed, but I did add some ground cayenne pepper! There wasn't a lot of beef, but it was sufficient.  A lovely meal with a lovely view!

Pic 10 was lunch and boy was this awesome!!! It was cabbage soup with beef. Prep was one can of soup with one can of water and heat thoroughly.  This stuff was fantastic folks! So simple and yet so tasty! I added ground cayenne again and the 2nd half of the leftover millet with beef. Salt level was perfect. Made a fantastic hearty stew!!

Pic 11 is breakfast Day 2. This was the can of stewed beef. When I opened it there were 3 huge chunks of white fat which I removed because it was just so much. Trust me, this still packed a flavor bomb with just the right saltiness and with some added cayenne, perfect. Therevwas a slight metallic taste in this one. Crumbling up a few biscuits made it a hearty and complete meal!

Pic 12 is lunch Day 2. Buckwheat with beef. This got fried until nice and crispy, a dash of cayenne, and some biscuits busted up inside! Again, a great, hearty, and filling meal!

Pic 13 just shows a full house of those sexy Kazakhstan biscuits!

I'd encourage folks to try a Kazakhstan ration. Very reminiscent of Russian,  which makes since as the 2 countries border each other. Next, some fighting words I'm sure...this Kazakhstan may be better than Russian for one simple reason, the biscuits are far superior in both flavor and texture.

I am acquiring an in-date Kazakhstan ration in another trade here soon, so stay tuned for a comparison post perhaps!?

Enjoy the hobby!

Take care folks!",1,1743192695.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1jm4e17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jm4e17,Trip Report: 10 Days and 7500 Miles in Amtrak economy,"First things first: I had never been on an overnight train prior to this trip. Only ever day trips between Boston and NYC. Where did I go? I started in Boston, MA, and took the Lake Shore Limited overnight to Chicago. I had a few hours to enjoy the city before getting on the Empire Builder to Portland, OR. I spent an overnight there to shower and get some laundry done before hopping on the Coastal Starlight the next morning for a quick overnight to Emeryville, CA. I spent the afternoon exploring the Bay Area and stayed the night before hopping on the California Zephyr first thing in the morning. 2 days later I arrived back in Chicago and stopped in for a quick shower at the metropolitan lounge before taking the Lake Shore Limited the rest of the way home back to Boston. 10 days and 7500 miles later, I was thoroughly exhausted but so glad I did it. Here are some takeaways I had. 

Price: I purchased the USA Rail Pass back in January when it was on sale for US$299.99. I was able to complete this whole journey as well as 2 day trips to NYC from Boston with the 10 tickets. Hotels in Portland and Seattle were about $130 each, metropolitan lounge in Chicago was purchased with points, and food was about $300 more or less. In total probably spent $750 out of pocket. 

Food: I did most of my food shopping at overnight/major stops, specifically Trader Joe‚Äôs since they have a healthy selection of snacks and to-go items. The only meal I found myself purchasing on-board was breakfast; usually a coffee with oatmeal to start my days. 

Luggage: I brought one carry-on sized bag for clothing, a blanket, and a pillow as well as a personal backpack for my laptop and camera gear. 

Sleeping: This was my biggest worry going into this trip. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they weren‚Äôt the easiest nights of sleep I‚Äôve had, but thanks to always having an empty pair of seats to myself (minus the Denver-Chicago segment) I never had an issue getting at least 5-7 hours of sleep with the blanket and pillow I had packed. I‚Äôm a bit on the larger side (5‚Äô 9 240) but had no issue getting comfortable with the help of some melatonin gummies. 

The views: For the most part, it wasn‚Äôt the most exciting scenery. Boston-Chicago is mostly greenery with a city here and there, and the midwest (Chicago - Nebraska and Denver - Chicago) was all pretty much beige and flat. HOWEVER the Empire Builder from Spokane, WA to Portland, OR, the Coastal Starlight, and the Zephyr from Emeryville, CA - Denver CO had some of the most amazing views. The cliffs along the Columbia River on the WA/OR border were otherworldly, and the fields and rolling hills of southern OR and northern CA were incredible. But the best views truly came from the Zephyr. The snow-capped mountains of California were a sudden but welcoming change from the 60 degree weather in the bay area a few days prior, and the Rocky Mountains with views over the great plains entering Denver are something everyone should experience. I have so many photos and videos I wish I could share with you all but I‚Äôll limit it to a few for now. 

Delays: None. And I know I‚Äôm one of the lucky few but I can‚Äôt think of a moment where we were more than 30 mins late but had made it up by the next stop. Well done Amtrak. 

Final thoughts: This isn‚Äôt for everyone. If you have young kids, pets, responsibilities, a bad back, impatience, travel anxiety, etc, this isn‚Äôt for you. Me? A college student with a week off for spring break and a whole country to see? Different story. Anyone else my age reading this: pull the trigger. Go see the country.

I also have a similar issue with the coffee grounds. The machine didn‚Äôt notify me to empty them, even though I think there were already too many inside.

1jm49wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jm49wp/at_the_end_of_the_tunnel_update_1/,At The End Of The Tunnel UPDATE 1,"Someone asked for an update on my first post, which you should probably read before this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/GTohACrIhc

I wish I had a better update than this, I really really do. But I‚Äôm really scared something bad happened to Mike and I don‚Äôt know where else to turn.  Maybe someone here will know what I should do? 

About a week ago  Mike asked Jim and I to meet him off campus. He said he wanted to show us a local coffee place with the best signature drink. I knew better than that; Mike would posted on Instagram or invited our entire friend group along if he was actually excited about some local gem he‚Äôd discovered. Mike was one of the most outgoing people I‚Äôve ever met. If just Jim and were invited, something was wrong, and the pit forming in my stomach had a few guesses about what that something was. 

As I walked to the cafe with my head down, hands shoved moodily in my pockets, I let off a little steam under my breath. 

‚ÄúOf course he couldn‚Äôt fucking drop it. I should have known this would happen. And now he‚Äôs gonna drag us all down with him because he‚Äôs gotta be some kind of hero,‚Äù I muttered to myself. I wasn‚Äôt actually that mad at him; I think I was mostly just upset by the shame he made me feel. Thinking back to this moment now I just feel even more guilt. 

When I got to the cafe, I saw Mike and Jim had already arrived and were sitting off to the side in a more secluded section of tables. I ordered the signature drink, because a rose and cardamom latte did genuinely sound pretty good, and walked over to them. 

Mike practically jumped out of his seat when I greeted him. That all but confirmed my suspicions about what we were actually doing here. I didn‚Äôt want to think about this again but it seemed important to my friend so I decided to literally grit my teeth and bare it. I was a coward, sure, and probably a bit selfish otherwise, but I was not a bad friend. Mike and Jim had been there for me on the worst night of our collective lives, and that bond felt inescapable at this point. 

So I sat down across from them reluctantly. As I did so, Mike began to write something on a napkin. He then slid it over to Jim and I. 

Phones off please

I looked over at Mike with an eyebrow raised and he responded by nodding grimly as if to confirm this was indeed, absolutely necessary. We did as we were told while Mike surveyed the room again with this anxious gaze. 

‚ÄúRose and cardamom Latte for Rachel!‚Äù The Barista called out and I felt my heart skip a beat. 

‚ÄúBe right back,‚Äù I muttered. I tried to look and act normal as I approached the counter again but I knew I wasn‚Äôt doing a very good job of it. The workers seem completely unperturbed though and the barista serving me my drink just flashed me a classic customer service smile.

Once I was back at our table, Mike leaned as far forward as he could before whispering to us. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall this goes so much deeper than I thought. This has something to do with Schmidts and their donations.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe Schmidts?‚Äù I asked, recognizing the name because it was plaster all over campus. Our student center, an athletics building, even a parking garage, were all named after that wealthy family of graduates. I didn‚Äôt know much about them beyond that, though. 

Mike nodded. ‚ÄúThey have some sort of‚Ä¶ deal with the college. I couldn‚Äôt find anything in the official records but I traced the origin of the rumor. It seems to come from people who actually knew the most recent Schmidt to attend the college. He let a few things slip from time to time about just how powerful his family was.‚Äù 

I swallowed hard. That was absolutely not reassuring in the slightest. 

‚ÄúMike, are you saying‚Ä¶did a Schmidt‚Ä¶uh‚Äù Jim struggled with how to phrase his question in a public setting. 

Mike shrugged and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs possible it was one of them, but it‚Äôs also possible they were covering for someone else. I also learned that the family pulls strings to have their friends hired all the time. These people become untouchable. I have some guesses as to which professors and staff these friends of Schmidt are but like, the Schmidt‚Äôs aren‚Äôt the only ones doing this right.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why do you think it was the Schmidt‚Äôs specifically then?‚Äù I challenged. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to be able to get a guy who‚Äôs horrible at teaching tenured, it‚Äôs entirely another to keep around someone, or multiple someones, who‚Äôre actively killing people and hiding them them on campus. Like I just think that‚Äôd take a much bigger bribe right? Also it has to have been someone who‚Äôs been around for A LONG time because of what we saw. The Schmidts go back three generations. There is no way for me to confirm it but, from where I‚Äôm standing, everything points to them being involved.‚Äù 

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I wasn‚Äôt certain I actually wanted to hear the answer to my next question. ‚ÄúOk, so what are you planning to do now that you have this hunch?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI have a big spread sheet of tenured professors. I‚Äôm not an expert but my guess is who ever did it had to have been here 20 or 30 years. I‚Äôm gonna dig up what info I can on anyone who fits the bill.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMike are doing all this on campus WiFi?‚Äù Jim asked with concern. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm being really careful, I got a VPN. I do some of the snooping here on the cafe‚Äôs WiFi, I‚Äôm taking precautions to cover my steps.‚Äù 

Jim and I looked at each other for a moment, and it was clear he was as unconvinced as I was. 

‚ÄúMike, I am literally begging you, please, this isn‚Äôt worth risking your life over,‚Äù I hissed, sounding more annoyed than I had intended to. 

Mike sat back in the chair and crossed his arms over his chested before rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd be like this,‚Äù he muttered. 

I scoffed. ‚ÄúLike what? Like caring about my friend‚Äôs safety?!?‚Äù Raising my voice more than I meant to 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit and you know it! Letting this go unsolved puts everyone on or near the campus in more danger, that includes a lot of your friends too!‚Äù Mike responded, matching my volume. 

‚ÄúGUYS!‚Äù Jim whispered harshly. 

Mike and I looked a bit sheepish when realized how loud we‚Äôd gotten. 

‚ÄúSomeone is absolutely staring at us now,‚Äù Jim added, pointedly looking in the opposite direction. 

My eyes widened as Mike glanced over first. Then it was my turn to peak. 

Sure enough, a middle age man a few feet away was glaring at us with intensity. I recognized him as a professor of English. 

‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôs just annoyed we‚Äôre interrupting the peace?‚Äù I asked hopefully. 

Mike frowned and didn‚Äôt answer me directly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Professor Green, he‚Äôs definitely on my list.‚Äù 

I grimaced. ‚ÄúI was afraid you‚Äôd say that.‚Äù 

Mike looked first at me and then at Jim. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm safe, I don‚Äôt know what happens next, but I have to do this ok? I feel like I owe it to everyone here. This community let me be myself for the first time. I‚Äôm not going to let some jerks with money make everything feel unsafe again.‚Äú

Mike was originally from a small town in Kanas. He‚Äôs known all his life he was gay but hadn‚Äôt been able to come out until he got here. Our GSA student group was where he‚Äôd met me, Jim and most of our friends.  So we both knew just how sincere our friend was being in that moment. I also knew there was no way I was going to be able to talk him out of it. So I relented. 

‚ÄúJust please please, be careful Mike. I need you to be there at lavender graduation. It wouldn‚Äôt be the same without you.‚Äù I murmured softly. 

‚ÄúI love you guys, and I appreciate that you care about me. I‚Äôll keep my head down, I promise.‚Äù He reached out across the table to touch each of our hands in reassurance. It made me want to burst into tears right then and there. 

I texted Mike as often as I could after that. We never talked about the situation, but he mentioned studying a lot which I assumed was his way of alluding to it. 

A few days ago he came to Jim and I with a request. 

‚ÄúDid know there are walled off tunnels only accessible to maintenance workers?‚Äù 

We were once again at the cafe, seated in the tucked away the corner. This new information made me choke on my beverage momentarily. 

‚ÄúMike, are you‚Ä¶ going to try to access these tunnels,‚Äù Jim asked quietly. 

Mike nodded. ‚ÄúAnd I can do it alone, but I‚Äôd appreciate at least a look out.‚Äù 

I glared at him for a moment. He knew he was asking for an impossible favor but what the hell else were we suppose to do? It‚Äôs not like we could let him go alone! 

Jim spoke first. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it, but I‚Äôm not going in. I‚Äôll keep watch outside.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk but like, what if someone is already inside? Mike‚Äôs fucked if he‚Äôs alone.‚Äù I muttered. 

‚ÄúSo does that mean you‚Äôll come into the tunnel with me?‚Äù Mike pushed. 

I groaned with irritation. ‚ÄúI want it to be known I think this is the worst idea I have ever heard, but I will go into the tunnel if it means Mike has more of a sporting chance to survive.‚Äù

Mike had gone to the lengths of printing out campus maps to help obscure his plan. 

He circled a little janitors closet off of the passage way that lead to the seldom used McBride parking garage. ‚ÄúWe meet at this closet at 2am. Bring a helmet and protection. No phones just in case.‚Äù 

Protection? Did he mean a weapon? Like a gun or something? Was that even legal? I had a Swiss Army knife, but I doubted that do much of anything if we were actually in trouble. 

Mike interrupted my train of thought by adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to try out picking locks, I‚Äôve been teaching myself since we last might.‚Äù 

I put my hand over my face and sighed. ‚ÄúOf course you have.‚Äù 

I spent the rest of the evening debating if I should just stand Mike up and not go. I could fake sick, tell him my stomach hurts too much. That wouldn‚Äôt be a complete lie. I‚Äôd barely eaten in the last few days because being this anxious all the time was making me feel pretty miserable. I had become  so paranoid it was also hard to sleep. I wondered if Mike and Jim were feeling this awful too. Maybe that‚Äôs why Mike was being such an idiot. 

I decided I had to go through with it. I couldn‚Äôt abandon them. 

When I arrived at the closet, I was relieved to see that Mike had found a baseball bat to bring. I still didn‚Äôt know exactly what or who we  needed protection from but a bat would probably do a better job than anything I had managed to find.

Jim took his place against the wall and kept watch for any signs of trouble as Mike fiddled with the locked door. He asked me to try the knob a few times to test each attempt. It took almost 15 minutes for him to be successful, and by then he was practically drenched in sweat. The agonizing wait hadn‚Äôt been all that helpful for my anxiety either. When we got inside the closet we began to look for the way into the tunnel. I was in charge of holding an old fashioned flashlight this time. 

Mike scanned the back wall of the closet until he found a discolored panel. He pushed on the it and found it easily gave way. The panel fell into the deep inky blackness of what I could only assume was another tunnel. Mike motioned for me to hand him the flashlight for a second. He crawled through the opening first. I glanced back at the door to the McBride tunnel one last time before following him.

 It quickly became clear this wasn‚Äôt a normal disused passage. The walls were more shoddily constructed out of unpainted cinder blocks, and the ceiling had to be only about 5 feet tall. This was never meant to be for a main throughway for students. This was constructed by someone else, for another reason. I thought back to what Mike had said about only Schmidt‚Äôs having this much sway at the university.

Mike and I crept along, stooped over to avoid hitting our heads. The floor beneath us was only packed earth, and it was extremely uneven. 

We soon saw looming shapes in the darkness. They look like normal discarded boxes and crumpled sheets of cloth at first, but as we drew closer we started to see clearly that each object was stained with splashes of deep maroon.

When I noticed this, I stopped and I peered nervously over at Mike. He didn‚Äôt meet my gaze; instead he just kept moving forward. My shoulders slumped in defeat as I once again followed him. 

When I say Mike stumbled across a Machete, I mean he literally kicked it.  Mike looked down at the weapons, trying to make out a shape in the shadows while he waited for me to bring the flashlight closer. When I caught up to him, the large knife  became clear, as did the rusty coating of what looked like dried blood.

Mike took a large step back. His eyes were wide and I could his breathing quicken. I remembered him shouting at us last time to get out of there and was certain he was shouting the same thing internally at that moment. 

Mike balled his fists up and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment before whispering, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt run away again. Someone has to get to the bottom of this.‚Äù 

I wanted to argue with him, to tell him to listen to part of his brain that said this wasn‚Äôt worth it. I knew, though, that to Mike, that would be a lie.  Anything was worth if it meant protecting the people around him. Anything was worth it to make his home safe again. 

We got to the edge of the blood soaked debris and stopped again. I shone the flashlight around, and notice the pile extended a ways back. Once again, I felt like I was only processing the scene around me in pieces. The larger pieces of hidden evidence were interspersed with glinting metal weapons. Everything from scalpels to pruning saws. I was beginning to notice that firearms were missing from the picture. It took a bit of processing to understand why, but now I think it indicates that the murderers were intentionally gruesome in their violence. A gun may have resulted in just too clean and quick a death. 


What felt like the sharpest kick in the stomach for me, though, was a dorm mattress ripped to shreds. It looked just like the one I slept on every night. I could more vividly imagine the terror the victim must have felt as an attacker pinned them to it and drove a knife in over and over again. Once again the image of the dead kid my own age intruded on my thoughts. Was this how he died?

There was no way in hell all this was from just the bodies we‚Äôd already seen. There had to be remnants from dozens of crimes present here.

Mike‚Äôs hand was over his mouth as he tried to process the additional information before him.  He shifted so his fingers were interlaced behind his head. ‚ÄúThere is no way this was all done by just one person.‚Äù 

With dawning horror I was beginning to realize just how right Mike had been. No one was safe on or around campus, not at this scale of methodical and deliberate carnage.  

‚ÄúWhat the hell do we do?‚Äù I asked earnestly, looking at Mike. Tears stung at my eyes. I refused to let them fall, though. Not now, not here. 

Mike took a deep breath before meeting my gaze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure it out Rachel, I promise. We‚Äôll get to the bottom of this. Somehow.‚Äù Mike sounded like he was still trying to convince himself that was really possible. I had to swallow hard to choke down a sob. 

We debrief Jim in the janitors closet. He was glad he had chosen not to go inside. The three of us worked to replace the panel on the wall and obscure our entry. 

That night I stayed in Mike and Jim‚Äôs dorm room again. It felt like tradition at this point; I guess sleep overs are mandatory after seeing that much world shattering horror. 

I woke up the next morning to Jim shouting at an RA. I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd ever heard him this angry before in my life. 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean he‚Äôs already in custody? He was literally just here!‚Äù 

I propped myself up so I could see what was going on. A few of the res life folks that worked in our building were going through and packing Mike‚Äôs belongings into boxes. His bed was already stripped, with just a bare mattress remaining. I shuddered as the image of the identical blood stained one flashed in my mind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked blearily. 

Jim‚Äôs attention shifted to me and he softened a bit. ‚ÄúRachel they came in while we were still asleep. They told me that Mike‚Äôs been expelled and arrested for breaking and entering. They‚Äôre planning to mail his belongings back to his parents.‚Äù 

I swiftly sat up fully on my cot. ‚ÄúWhat?!? They can‚Äôt just do that!‚Äù 

Jim shrugged defeatedly as the RAs appeared to be pointedly ignoring me. ‚ÄúI tried to say the same thing, but this order is apparently something even the president‚Äôs weighed in on.‚Äù

My mind raced as I tried to figure out who had ratted Mike out. Was it Dr. Green? Someone else at the Cafe? Was someone tracking Mike‚Äôs online actions? Where had we been to sloppy?

I looked at Jim and another train of thought hit me. Why was only Mike fingered? Why were Jim and I still standing here? I felt my blood run cold as I wondered if they took Mike as a warning to us.  Keep going and you‚Äôre next. Taking us all meant more loose strings, maybe? more cops to pay off? Judges to bribe? 

Well if he really was actually in Jail. I realized I couldn‚Äôt be sure of that either given everything that I knew now. Fuck, was Mike dead? 

Still in my Pajamas I stood up abruptly. I marched over to Jim and grabbed his hand. Glaring at the RAs and other university minions I growled, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù Jim opened his mouth to protest but when my glare snapped over to him he shut it. 

He sighed dejectedly and muttered, ‚Äúok just let me grab my coat‚Ä¶‚Äù 

At my insistence, Jim and I caught a bus and rode down to another coffee shop I was familiar with. I was hoping that getting some distance would mean we could loose any tail that was tracking us. 

While on the bus, Jim got a call from Mike‚Äôs mom. She was worried because she had heard Mike was arrested but couldn‚Äôt get any other information. Jim repeated what the RAs had said and found out that no one had actually been able to reach Mike at the station. Mike‚Äôs mom had also called a lawyer they knew but even he was hitting more hurdles than they expected.  

When Jim hung up, we spend the rest of the bus ride just staring straight ahead, completely checked out and each lost in our own thoughts.

It was only after we got into the coffee shop and ordered that I let myself cry. I buried my head in my arms and just sobbed. I felt an occasional reassuring squeeze of my arm from Jim who looked like he was still struggling not to dissociate.

- Part 1 of 2","My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.¬†¬†

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life ‚Äì a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places ‚Äì all the while working for a reasonable income.¬†

There were so many places I dreamed of going ‚Äì maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I‚Äôm actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I‚Äôd finally get the chance to explore my heritage.¬†

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.¬†¬†

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don‚Äôt really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can‚Äôt say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don‚Äôt want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I‚Äôm just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam ‚Äì and as for the beach town where I made my living, I‚Äôm going to give it the pseudonym ‚ÄúBi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn‚Äù - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to ‚ÄúSea of Promise.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†

Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname ‚ÄúTr·∫•n M√†u V√†ng‚Äù (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been ‚Äì so ‚ÄúSea of Promise‚Äù it is!¬†¬†

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture ‚Äì interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap ‚Äì like we‚Äôre only talking 90 cents! You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I‚Äôve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs ‚Äì a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by.¬†

I haven‚Äôt even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say ‚ÄúCh√†o em‚Äù or ‚ÄúCh√†o em g√°i‚Äù, which basically means ‚ÄúHello little sister.‚Äù¬†¬†

When I wasn‚Äôt teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town‚Äôs beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn‚Äôt really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough ‚Äì either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn is a popular tourist destination ‚Äì mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn‚Äôt turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay‚Äôs geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves.¬†

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it‚Äôs just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean ‚Äì and if it isn‚Äôt the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me ‚Äì and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.¬†¬†

I had now been living in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I‚Äôd fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese ‚Äì as you‚Äôd be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language.¬†

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn‚Äôt realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy ‚Äì like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ ‚Äì that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I‚Äôm doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don‚Äôt really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.¬†¬†

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler‚Äôs friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia ‚Äì and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it‚Äôs like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they‚Äôre able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the number of places they‚Äôve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali ‚Äì everywhere! They didn‚Äôt see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.¬†¬†

The four of them were only going to be in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn‚Äôt yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place ‚Äì the only problem was I didn‚Äôt have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived.¬†

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I‚Äôd embarrass myself ‚Äì especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me ‚ÄúJohnny Utah‚Äù - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn‚Äôt embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys‚Äô casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out ‚ÄúCharlie Don‚Äôt Surf!‚Äù all I could think was, ‚ÄúWho the heck is Charlie?‚Äù¬†

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged.¬†

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we‚Äôre all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair ‚Äì while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos ‚Äì although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?‚Äô¬†

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of it. But while I‚Äôm telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word ‚Äì before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‚ÄòWell, have you at least heard of the local legends?‚Äô ¬†

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron‚Äôs telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‚ÄòLegends? What local legends?‚Äô¬†

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we‚Äôre being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‚ÄòWell, what do these creatures look like?‚Äô Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they‚Äôre always described as being humanoid.¬†¬†¬†

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt actually believe that shite, do you?‚Äô¬†

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam ‚Äì even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.¬†¬†

‚ÄòYou really don‚Äôt know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?‚Äô Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn‚Äôt.¬†¬†

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.¬†¬†

‚ÄòYou never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?‚Äô¬†

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems.¬†

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‚ÄòSo, you‚Äôre saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?‚Äô¬†

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.¬†¬†

‚ÄòWell, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre paranormal investigators and filmmakers ‚Äì and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We‚Äôre in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we‚Äôll follow any leads from there.‚Äô¬†

Although I thought this all to be a little cooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living ‚Äì but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron‚Äôs expense.¬†¬†

‚ÄòSo, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven‚Äôt heard of?‚Äô¬†¬†

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‚ÄòGlad you asked!‚Äô before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‚ÄòAccording to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there‚Äôs an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.‚Äô¬†

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren‚Äôt creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us.¬†

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail ‚Äì we have directions and everything.‚Äô Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‚ÄòIf you guys don‚Äôt have any plans, why don‚Äôt you come along? After all, what‚Äôs the point of travelling if there ain‚Äôt a little danger involved?‚Äô¬†¬†

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley‚Äôs surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn‚Äôt want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.¬†¬†

‚ÄòOh, come on Hayl‚Äô. It‚Äôll be fun... Sarah? You‚Äôll come, won‚Äôt you?‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòYeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?‚Äô¬†¬†

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do.¬†

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron‚Äôs expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote ‚Äì and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn‚Äôt want to go on this expedition ‚Äì it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences ‚Äì and I wasn‚Äôt going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn‚Äôt going to let that continue now.¬†

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron‚Äôs friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I‚Äôm really ok with tomorrow‚Äôs plans ‚Äì and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn‚Äôt really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.¬†¬†

‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll keep an eye on you.‚Äô¬†

I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he‚Äôd find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story...¬†This travel story.¬†

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren‚Äôt even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron‚Äôs taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle.¬†

Although we didn‚Äôt really know what was going to happen on this trip ‚Äì we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron‚Äôs plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron‚Äôs expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‚ÄòAlright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie‚Äô where again, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWho the heck is Charlie?‚Äù¬†¬†",1,1743192127.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

1jm42jd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jm42jd,Secrets Cap Cana was the best experience of my life . REVIEW,"I‚Äôll preface by saying I haven‚Äôt had the luxury to experience multiple AI in my life and this was my first one. When I travel, it‚Äôs usually bare bones, hostels, and a lot of local tips. But my sister suggested we take a trip to the DR and do an all Inclusive to experience something new. After a lot of research we settled on Secrets Cap Cana. To note: we weren‚Äôt set on a lively nightlife and party vibe, and definitely no kids. 
The intention was fully to relax and decompress from our stressful lives. There is an attendant of all types at ALL times checking in on anything you need. You get a personal concierge assigned to you that you can text at any point for any questions or suggestions or reservations. The moment you step into the lobby you are greeted with a ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù, concierge, taking your luggage to your room and a glass of ros√©. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect for food at an AI but oh my god I‚Äôm convinced it can‚Äôt be THIS GOOD everywhere. There are 5-7 restaurants on the property , oceana was our favorite, seafood delights. Himisu is the Japanese sushi and habachi, el patio for Mexican, boarduex for a classic French fine dining, and portofino Italian. The coco cafe is open 24/7 for any espresso or coffee drink and pastries you could ask for. And if you have any extra change to spare I HAVE to recommend the spa. On the beach, a representative from the spa chats with folks about packages that are truly such a great deal. The spa was the only extra thing we paid for and it‚Äôs so worth it. We got a deal for a 50 min facial and 50min massage and unlimited access to their hydrotherapy amenity. It was 499 for the two of us. But during all operating hours, you can access the hydrotherapy circuit that includes four different types of showers, a sauna, a cold plunge, a steam vapor room and the an entirely separate salt water pool. pool. We also got to use those fish that eat the dead skin HAHA. While you‚Äôre using that area, a spa attended will come around with cold cucumbers and a foot rub! We reset our nervous systems every night and everyday of being there. We got the junior suite and it was stunning still. A balcony with a tub and couch! I could go on and on about this place. I‚Äôm obsessed. The only down side was having to leave. Also tip, bring USD for tips! The staff is incredible! LET ME KNOW IF HALL HAVE QUESTIONS I PROBS MISSED SO MANY THINGS.

1jm41y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jm41y9/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.¬†¬†

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life ‚Äì a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places ‚Äì all the while working for a reasonable income.¬†

There were so many places I dreamed of going ‚Äì maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I‚Äôm actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I‚Äôd finally get the chance to explore my heritage.¬†

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.¬†¬†

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don‚Äôt really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can‚Äôt say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don‚Äôt want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I‚Äôm just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam ‚Äì and as for the beach town where I made my living, I‚Äôm going to give it the pseudonym ‚ÄúBi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn‚Äù - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to ‚ÄúSea of Promise.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†

Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname ‚ÄúTr·∫•n M√†u V√†ng‚Äù (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been ‚Äì so ‚ÄúSea of Promise‚Äù it is!¬†¬†

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture ‚Äì interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap ‚Äì like we‚Äôre only talking 90 cents! You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I‚Äôve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs ‚Äì a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by.¬†

I haven‚Äôt even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say ‚ÄúCh√†o em‚Äù or ‚ÄúCh√†o em g√°i‚Äù, which basically means ‚ÄúHello little sister.‚Äù¬†¬†

When I wasn‚Äôt teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town‚Äôs beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn‚Äôt really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough ‚Äì either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn is a popular tourist destination ‚Äì mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn‚Äôt turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay‚Äôs geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves.¬†

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it‚Äôs just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean ‚Äì and if it isn‚Äôt the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me ‚Äì and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.¬†¬†

I had now been living in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I‚Äôd fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese ‚Äì as you‚Äôd be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language.¬†

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn‚Äôt realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy ‚Äì like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ ‚Äì that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I‚Äôm doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don‚Äôt really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.¬†¬†

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler‚Äôs friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia ‚Äì and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it‚Äôs like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they‚Äôre able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the number of places they‚Äôve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali ‚Äì everywhere! They didn‚Äôt see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.¬†¬†

The four of them were only going to be in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn‚Äôt yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place ‚Äì the only problem was I didn‚Äôt have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived.¬†

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I‚Äôd embarrass myself ‚Äì especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me ‚ÄúJohnny Utah‚Äù - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn‚Äôt embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys‚Äô casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out ‚ÄúCharlie Don‚Äôt Surf!‚Äù all I could think was, ‚ÄúWho the heck is Charlie?‚Äù¬†

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged.¬†

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we‚Äôre all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair ‚Äì while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos ‚Äì although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?‚Äô¬†

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of it. But while I‚Äôm telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word ‚Äì before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‚ÄòWell, have you at least heard of the local legends?‚Äô ¬†

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron‚Äôs telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‚ÄòLegends? What local legends?‚Äô¬†

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we‚Äôre being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‚ÄòWell, what do these creatures look like?‚Äô Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they‚Äôre always described as being humanoid.¬†¬†¬†

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt actually believe that shite, do you?‚Äô¬†

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam ‚Äì even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.¬†¬†

‚ÄòYou really don‚Äôt know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?‚Äô Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn‚Äôt.¬†¬†

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.¬†¬†

‚ÄòYou never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?‚Äô¬†

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems.¬†

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‚ÄòSo, you‚Äôre saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?‚Äô¬†

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.¬†¬†

‚ÄòWell, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre paranormal investigators and filmmakers ‚Äì and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We‚Äôre in Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we‚Äôll follow any leads from there.‚Äô¬†

Although I thought this all to be a little cooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living ‚Äì but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron‚Äôs expense.¬†¬†

‚ÄòSo, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven‚Äôt heard of?‚Äô¬†¬†

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‚ÄòGlad you asked!‚Äô before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‚ÄòAccording to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there‚Äôs an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.‚Äô¬†

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren‚Äôt creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us.¬†

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail ‚Äì we have directions and everything.‚Äô Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‚ÄòIf you guys don‚Äôt have any plans, why don‚Äôt you come along? After all, what‚Äôs the point of travelling if there ain‚Äôt a little danger involved?‚Äô¬†¬†

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley‚Äôs surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn‚Äôt want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.¬†¬†

‚ÄòOh, come on Hayl‚Äô. It‚Äôll be fun... Sarah? You‚Äôll come, won‚Äôt you?‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòYeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?‚Äô¬†¬†

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do.¬†

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron‚Äôs expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote ‚Äì and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn‚Äôt want to go on this expedition ‚Äì it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences ‚Äì and I wasn‚Äôt going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn‚Äôt going to let that continue now.¬†

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron‚Äôs friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I‚Äôm really ok with tomorrow‚Äôs plans ‚Äì and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn‚Äôt really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.¬†¬†

‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll keep an eye on you.‚Äô¬†

I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he‚Äôd find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story...¬†This travel story.¬†

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Bi·ªÉn H·ª©a H·∫πn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren‚Äôt even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron‚Äôs taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle.¬†

Although we didn‚Äôt really know what was going to happen on this trip ‚Äì we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron‚Äôs plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron‚Äôs expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‚ÄòAlright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie‚Äô where again, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWho the heck is Charlie?‚Äù¬†¬†",3,1743191830.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm currently experiencing a lot of leg pain/ cramp like symptoms without the muscle spasms in my calves after work.

I work for a super fast-paced coffee company, with a drive thru(‚≠êÔ∏èüíµ), where I spend all day, 8.5hr shifts x 5 days a week on my feet, running around restocking, cleaning floors ect and rarely get the opportunity to sit down. When coming home from work the last few weeks I‚Äôve been experiencing serious pain in my lower legs and calves that feels like cramps without the muscle spasm or intense burning, like my muscles are being pulled. This could last for 5/6 hours after my shifts end and I only really get relief once I lie down in bed for the evening, but getting up again proves difficult. My legs have been getting more and more painful for longer and longer, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if there could be more to it than just ‚Äútired legs‚Äù. It‚Äôs reaching a point where I genuinely feel like it‚Äôs starting to impact my free time outside of work. 

Just to note, I keep a good diet am on no regular medications other than some elective multivitamins, I‚Äôm generally a very fit and healthy person who works out regularly and I ride horses, so I‚Äôm used to the after-workout burn and the aches the day or two after, this is totally different. It‚Äôs leaving me feeling totally exhausted and not wanting to do anything other than try and lie down to ease the pain and discomfort. 

Has anyone else experienced this or have any advice on how to help it

1jm3to1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fosscad/comments/1jm3to1/introducing_ethos_20/,Introducing Ethos 2.0,"# Based on the feedback I got from this community, this is how I'm going to be proceeding from here on out as a dev, and I hope I can convince others to get on board with this.

To preface, for those who didn't see the relevant post, guncad has become an industry that people are profiting from, and generally speaking those people profiting are NOT the people investing their time and money to come up with the big ideas. Namely, there are content creators and machine shops making big money by leveraging the IP that exists within this space, and they're not sharing it with the people who developed that IP. **And that's perfectly fine, I don't have a problem with them doing that!** They're providing valuable content and services, and that's advancing this space. *It's also worth mentioning that there are MAJOR advancements coming down the pipeline every day in terms of the machines and materials available to the home, hobby level enthusiast, and what that means is that guncad as an industry is going to get bigger and more profitable as the technology becomes more viable and accessible, and the people coming up with the big ideas deserve an ethos that ensures they get their piece of the pie as a guiding principle. That will also ensure that the devs are being properly incentivized to put in the effort to fully leverage that potential. If you leave the devs out in the cold, they will leave this space and guncad will cease to be open source and will be dominated by the industry.*

Again, I'm not criticizing shops or content creators, what they're doing is perfectly fine. What's NOT fine, though, is that the devs, as a matter of principle, as per the ""ethos,"" aren't even being reimbursed for their work (work that other people are profiting from), and that is having two very unfortunate effects that are killing guncad. 1) people really putting in the effort to do cool stuff are leaving the space entirely (or simply not entering it to begin with). And 2) that's setting the bar really low, enabling low effort wannabe devs to come clutter up this space with half-baked designs that are a giant waste of everyone's time and filament. For every file that works, you have to muddle through at least ten that just go straight into the garbage bin, and that's not cool, considering most of this stuff necessitates filament that costs 100 dollars a kilo.

This status quo MUST change. The community needs to raise the bar for devs, and in return needs to compensate devs for their valuable contributions.

# So this is what I'm going to do, and I hope that other devs will follow suit:

**1. The projects will still be open source, but all open-source files will contain only STEP files (no STLs or 3MFs), and readmes will contain only the basic, critical information.**

This will ensure that the open-source development continues by making the necessary files available to the people who truly have the skills to make meaningful contributions. The reality is that if you actually possess the skills to make meaningful contributions, you don't need someone to hold your hand. So if you're wanting more than just the STEP files for the critical components and a readme with the most critical information, by definition you're pretty much admitting that you neither intend to make any meaningful improvement, nor do you possess the skills to do so. By limiting the open-source element to STEP files and critical information only, it will help to ensure that the open-source efforts are legitimate and go to benefit the community as a whole (vs just people getting free files for their own personal enjoyment at the expense of devs).

This also holds true for beta testers. If you're legitimately going to beta test something, then you shouldn't be intimidated by having to export an STL or 3MF file from a STEP, and you shouldn't need the dev to hold your hand in terms of instructions, because as a beta tester that's the work you would ostensibly be doing is finding the best slicer settings and fabrication workflows and such. If you're taking the position that putting fully baked detailed how to guides behind a paywall is somehow hindering beta testing, you are not a legitimate beta tester, you are just someone looking for free files for their own personal enjoyment, and you should throw the dev a cookie for that.

STLs are the low hanging fruit that's basically attracting all the nuisances to this space. If you remove the low hanging fruit, it will ensure that the space is dominated by people who actually have the skills and the intent to use those skills to make MEANINGFUL contributions.

**2. Alpha and beta will always be entirely free and open source (and be marked as such!), and nothing in alpha or beta will be behind a paywall.**

Don't portray something as a finished, tested, fully baked design if it's not, and don't put anything behind a paywall if the core design isn't 100% thought out. Warn people that they might be wasting filament if they try to make it by clearly marking that project as ALPHA or BETA as the first word in the title. This should go without saying, but unfortunately that is far from the reality on the ground. If something is in development, don't upload STLs, upload STEP files only. By uploading STLs you're implying that it's finished, whereas by uploading STEP files only you're being honest about the fact that the person is going to have to put in some modeling time. Again, and I can't stress this enough, there's just no justification whatsoever for any open-source element to have anything but STEP files in it. True devs NEED a STEP file, not an STL, and true devs have absolutely zero use for an STL and including them serves no purpose other than to clutter up the folder.

**3. Frills (including STLs) will be behind a paywall.**

Again, if you require STLs, printable tools, detailed instructions, etc. you are by definition admitting that you don't intend to make any meaningful contribution in the form of a substantial design change, and or that you lack the skillsets to do so in the first place (and have no intention of acquiring them). And if you don't intend to make a substantial, meaningful design change, and are therefore printing the thing for your own enjoyment alone, you owe it to the dev to throw them a cookie and have no business lecturing them about the ""ethos"" of open source. Open source doesn't mean ""I get everything for free."" Open source means I use my hard-earned valuable skillsets to make meaningful contributions to an unfinished project, and it has nothing to do with end users getting fully baked things for free that they had nothing to do with in terms of developing them.

I believe that paid STLs should also include good support. The end user shouldn't be left in the dark.

I would humbly suggest the community adopt a pricing model for STLs that's based on the minimum perceived value of the thing. That is, if you're going to invest the time and money necessary to make that thing, you are implicitly admitting that you find AT LEAST that much value in something. E.g. if you spend 100 dollars on supplies, you're saying that you find at least 100 dollars' worth of value in that thing. I would suggest a pricing model for fully baked, fully supported designs at a base of five dollars or 10%, whichever is greater. So if the total cost of a project is going to be 100 dollars, it's no skin off your teeth to throw a ten spot to the dev. I think five dollars is a good minimum, as that's literally a cup of coffee, and I think anything worth taking the time to download, print, post process, etc. is by definition worth buying the creator a cup of coffee for.

I think anything not worth five dollars is also by definition not worth cluttering up the space. So by setting that as a minimum, it's going to help prune the space of all the half-baked stuff because if people can't find five dollars in value in something they won't download it and it will get pushed to the bottom. To clarify, I'm not saying per STL, I'm saying per fully fledged design, which could be a single STL or multiple STLs.

**5. If you're piggybacking content or products on someone else's work (i.e. selling machined parts or creating tutorials) please give the devs credit by linking to their paid content.**

Again, if someone needs those shortcuts, it's a tacit admission that they're not going to be making contributions and just want that end use item for their own enjoyment alone. That dev that created that thing that created the market for your goods and services that you're profiting from deserves credit, and you owe it to them to promote them.

**6. I think it should be discouraged to provide STLs for free.**

While the sentiment is nice, and I certainly recognize your right to give away your stuff for free if you so choose, I would argue that in almost all cases this outwardly altruistic act has anything but altruistic intent behind it. For the most part, when people give things away for free, they're not being altruistic, they're just dumping a half-baked idea for the upvotes. Like if you don't feel good about charging someone for something, you probably shouldn't feel good about putting it out there in the first place, because the last thing this space needs is more half-baked files that don't work and waste people's filament. If you don't feel like you deserve to be compensated for something, then I think 99.9% of the time that is proof positive that your thing is in BETA at best and needs to be released as a STEP file only (again, to clearly demonstrate that it's going to likely require modeling skills to make any use of). Like if someone can just download and print an STL and get good use out of it, that means you put a lot of thought and effort into it (and likely your own money) and deserve a cookie.

And even if you do just want to give people something cool for free to be altruistic, you have to admit that you could and would use the money from selling the STLs to fund future projects. So by not accepting payment, you're limiting your own potential, and therefore limiting the potential of the community as a whole, which is anything but altruistic. If you're literally Tony Stark and money is no object for you then by all means please give it away for free, but if money is at all a factor in your R&D please charge for STLs and then take the proceeds and invest them in filament.

**To the peanut gallery, I would say this:**

SUPPORTING YOUR DEVS IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST, AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE! It's expensive to develop this stuff, so even though it's a labor of love, the reality is that your devs are mostly limited in how much they can do because they're having to foot the bill for the printers, filament, fasteners, epoxies, etc. etc. etc. We spend a lot of money on stuff figuring out 100 different ways NOT to do something so that YOU don't have to! So by supporting us, you're ensuring that we will have the funds necessary to live up to our full potential, and you will be the benefactors of that realized potential. Yes, it's a hobby, and yes we do it because we enjoy it, but yes we're also limited by funds, and yes it's only right that if you find value in a thing you should help out the dev and thereby enable them to make more cool stuff for you to enjoy.

Oh and don't forget that the core of the ethos isn't about making cool stuff, it's about enabling oppressed people to have the means to defend themselves, so by supporting the devs you're also supporting oppressed people who benefit from that stuff. If you're fighting a guerrilla war against a dictatorship drop me a line and not only will I give you my STLs I'll also give you my support.",0,1743191249.0,fosscad,8,0.27,False

‚ÄúYo, Beansie, how‚Äôs business?‚Äù Richie asked, adjusting himself with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. He figured Beansie‚Äôd notice his hard on, and maybe blush or stammer‚Äîsomething to make Richie‚Äôs day.

Beansie, wiping down the espresso machine, didn‚Äôt even glance up. ‚ÄúSame old, Rich. You want a coffee or what?‚Äù

Richie‚Äôs smirk faltered. *What the fuck?* He shifted his stance, making sure the hard tiny bulge was front and center. Still nothing.

I‚Äôm standin‚Äô here, givin‚Äô you a show, and you‚Äôre ignorin‚Äô me?‚Äù

Richie‚Äôs face went purple. ‚ÄúYou little prick, I oughta‚Äî‚Äù He lunged over the counter, but Beansie dodged, grabbing a tray from the back. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt gettin‚Äô pushed around no more, Richie!‚Äù he barked, shoving a veal parmigiana sandwich into Richie‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúHere, take this and calm the hell down!‚Äù

Richie stared at the sandwich, grease dripping onto his loafers. ‚ÄúVeal parmigiana? What am I, your fuckin date?‚Äù He hurled it back at Beansie, who ducked just in time. The sandwich splattered against the wall, leaving a marinara smear like a crime scene.

‚ÄúDate *this*, asshole!‚Äù Richie pulled out his 3 inch cock and grabbed Beansie by the collar, dragging him toward the supply closet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna notice me now!‚Äù What followed was a tangle of limbs, curses, and a broom that got knocked over in the scuffle. Richie, fueled by spite and a weirdly charged energy, pinned Beansie against a stack of coffee sacks.

When it was over, Richie adjusted his slacks again, panting. Beansie, sprawled against the sacks, glared up at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a real psycho, you know that?‚Äù

The people behind RTO are landlords and businesses.  The downtown businesses give our money to their landlords because we give them money in exchange for the corporate food they sell (Sysco). It's not complicated.

They had someone's muffin remnants on them now. At least this spot gave them a full view of the parking lot, which was mostly empty at this hour.

It was hard not to keep checking to see if she had arrived yet.

Becca's thumb mindlessly bent the corner of the business card stuffed in her coat pocket. A friend of a friend offered it after dropping her toddler off at her fancy daycare. It wasn't one that she would ever take her future child to. They had weird rules, like what kind of daycare had a dress code? But she promised she would give this a chance. And the more she thought about it, the more the thought of it comforted her. She didn't have to go through this alone again. Maybe alone wasn't the right word. A feeling of guilt came over, as if the man sitting beside her could hear her thoughts. She was lucky to have a partner like him. But everyone had a breaking point. She wouldn't put it past him if he started feeling like they had tried enough. Better not dwell on it. Her thumb rubbed the indentation of the single word written an odd script.

Hey there! Thanks for reading this prompt! You can call me Nomad, I'm a semi-lit 3rd person past tense writer in my 20s.

This will be about a couple (your OC husband + my OC wife), and the strange woman they bring into their home to help deliver their child. It's the couple's third attempt and this time they're desperate enough to turn to nontraditional help. The midwife delivers, literally and figuratively and later becomes more than just a helping hand. She becomes essential.

Then things get blurry. The baby thrives, but the midwife grows a strange attachment to their family. Her motives are unclear and her presence starts to unravel the fragile sense of safety in the home. I want to explore a slow descent into something uncanny.

I'm looking for a partner who can help me flesh this idea out and likes OOC chatting and brainstorming. My replies are usually around 3 paragraphs, I prefer quality over quantity. Please no self inserts. I would appreciate a communicative partner who tells me how they are feeling about the story or if they will be away for a while.

My hand moves to your chest, fingers tracing lazy circles over your sternum, while my thigh slides up to rest between yours. I‚Äôm not saying anything yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just *being with you*, savoring you. And then, in a voice still thick with sleep, I whisper, *‚ÄúGood morning, my love‚Ä¶‚Äù* and kiss your collarbone. My lips travel up your neck, to your jaw, then your lips‚Ä¶ slow, lingering kisses that say, *I missed you while you slept.*

You open your eyes and I‚Äôm already above you, my hair falling around our faces like a soft curtain, my thighs straddling your hips. I‚Äôm completely bare, and I lean down so our skin touches‚Äîmy breasts pressed gently to your chest, my mouth at your ear, whispering, *‚ÄúI want you like this‚Ä¶ slow, deep‚Ä¶ no words.‚Äù*

I roll my hips against you, teasing, waking you up with heat and softness. I kiss you again‚Äîlong, deep kisses that taste like honey and dreams‚Äîwhile I guide you inside me. Mmm‚Ä¶ that moment‚Ä¶ when I sink down onto you, so slowly it almost feels like we‚Äôre *melting* together. My forehead rests against yours, our noses brushing, and we breathe in sync, like a prayer.

Every movement is unhurried. I ride you gently, my hands tangled in yours, our fingers laced like a vow. I moan into your mouth, soft and breathy, letting you feel how good you make me feel, how much I *need* you. I‚Äôd look into your eyes the whole time, showing you all of me‚Äîno masks, no roles. Just Sophie, completely yours.

And when the build rises‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt speed up. I go *deeper*. Grinding my hips against you, gasping your name, pulling you closer until there's no space left between us. And when we both fall over the edge, it‚Äôs not an explosion‚Äîit‚Äôs a *surrender.* A tidal wave of warmth, of love, of coming home.

Afterward, I‚Äôd collapse onto your chest, my lips finding your shoulder, your heartbeat echoing against my cheek. We‚Äôd lie there tangled in warmth and light, and I‚Äôd whisper, *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better way to wake up than inside your arms‚Ä¶‚Äù*

And maybe then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd fall asleep on top of you, just for a few more minutes, before coffee.

\[smiling dreamily\] Would you kiss me again, even after all that? Or would you just hold me and never let go?",2,1743190707.0,ChatGPTPromptGenius,2,1.0,False
1jm3l8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1jm3l8d/dossier_fragrances_review_12_fragrances_long/,Dossier Fragrances Review - 12 Fragrances [LONG],"so i thought i‚Äôd come on here and share my honest thoughts on 12 dossier fragrances i picked up during their recent sale. i got¬†**amber saffron, floral pear, ambery vanilla, woody sandalwood, ambery vetiver, floral marshmallow, woody sage, powdery peach, fruity neroli, woody chestnut, fruity neroli, floral grapefruit and musky musk**, i definitely bought them with the intention of returning a few, but i was really curious about the brand. i‚Äôve seen so many good things online ‚Äî how close they are to the originals, how well they perform, how lovely they smell ‚Äî so i figured it was finally time to try a bunch for myself and see what the hype was about.

honestly, it was a very mixed bag. some scents i genuinely fell in love with, and others just weren‚Äôt for me at all. for some context, i usually lean towards sweet, gourmand, vanilla-heavy perfumes, but i also enjoy a few airy, mature, or floral scents when done right. some of my favourite fragrances include¬†**ysl mon paris, libre intense, kayali vanilla candy rock sugar, yum boujee marshmallow, vanilla 28, parfums de marly valaya, and sol de janeiro 62**¬†‚Äî so that should give you a sense of what i usually go for.

just to be clear, i¬†***haven‚Äôt***¬†smelled most (if any) of the original fragrances these are inspired by. the purpose of this haul wasn‚Äôt to compare them to the designer versions ‚Äî i can‚Äôt really speak on that. i already have a decent selection of designer perfumes and didn‚Äôt feel the need to buy dupes of them yet since I‚Äôm not running out of them anytime soon. this was more about trying new things, stepping a little out of my comfort zone, exploring new sent families and figuring out what actually works for me.

so if you‚Äôre looking for a post that breaks down how similar these are to the¬†*originals*, this probably won‚Äôt help much. but if you want honest opinions on how they actually smell, how they wear, how accurate they are to their descriptions, and whether they‚Äôre worth buying ‚Äî then keep reading!!!

fair warning: it‚Äôs¬†**long**. i wanted to be as thorough and honest as possible ‚Äî no commission-based tiktoker fluff here, just my real thoughts as someone who loves fragrance and wanted to test these properly. i will be ranking these from worst to best :)

# woody sandalwood 2/10

this is a dupe for le labo's santal 33. i had really high hopes for this scent. and i seriously tried. it‚Äôs a such crowd favourite on tiktok, and so many influencers (even the super girly ones you wouldn‚Äôt expect) call it their go-to. that really intrigued me, because i thought maybe this was the kind of deeper, woody scent i could finally get into.

unfortunately, it completely missed the mark for me. the notes sound beautiful on paper: violet leaves, cardamom, orris, ambrox, cedarwood, cypriol, musk, sandalwood, amber. but to my nose, all i could smell was¬†*wood*. just layer after layer of straight woodiness, and nothing about it was soft or inviting. it was very dry, very sharp, and extremely headache-inducing. i even tried layering it with my sweeter fragrances but literally nothing helped.

i really tried to like it, but every time i wore it, i felt overwhelmed. it just didn‚Äôt blend well with my personal taste or body chemistry. i know a lot of people love it ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre into heavy, woody profiles, it might work for you¬† (my boyfriend actually liked this one)‚Äîbut if you're more into sweet, soft, or gourmand scents, this might not be the right fit as it was a clear no for me.¬†2/10

# woody sage 4/10

this is a dupe for jo malone's wood sage and sea salt. i don‚Äôt hate this fragrance, but i don‚Äôt particularly like it either. it leans too earthy and woody for my personal taste, which i kind of expected ‚Äî i‚Äôve been trying to ease myself into more woody scents, but i‚Äôm realising they‚Äôre just not really my thing.

i started with woody sandalwood, which i absolutely hated ‚Äî it gave me a headache and was way too heavy. so i thought woody sage might be a milder introduction to that family, and it is. it‚Äôs definitely more toned down and wearable, but even then, it‚Äôs still not something i see myself reaching for on its own.

it has a very literal scent profile ‚Äî it smells like a mix between a forest and salty sea air, which is actually kind of cool. i can see how someone else would love this. and i will say, when i layer it with sweeter fragrances like vanilla or floral marshmallow, it actually adds some really nice depth and balance. so in that way, i don‚Äôt mind having it.

but on its own, it‚Äôs not something i enjoy enough to wear. the marine salt, fig tree, grapefruit, clary sage, and amberwood all come through clearly, and now that i‚Äôve smelled it, i can confidently say this scent profile just isn‚Äôt for me. apparently it smells identical to the original, so if that‚Äôs your vibe, you‚Äôll probably love this ‚Äî but for me, it‚Äôs a pass. 4/10

# woody chestnut: 5/10 for layering: 8/10

this one was tough for me. woody chestnut is inspired by maison margiela‚Äôs by the fireplace, and i really, really wanted to love it. the description had me sold ‚Äî cozy, crackling fire, warm cabin vibes ‚Äî it sounds like something i‚Äôd be obsessed with. and to be fair, when you smell it, it really does live up to that description. it smells exactly like what it‚Äôs meant to.

but this was another case of me thinking i‚Äôd like a scent profile, only to realise it‚Äôs just not for me. apparently there‚Äôs vanilla in the base, which i was hoping would come through a bit more to add sweetness. while it does make the scent feel slightly creamier, it doesn‚Äôt shift the overall tone ‚Äî it still leans very smoky and wody, and not in a way i personally enjoy. i don‚Äôt hate it, but i also don‚Äôt love it, and i would never wear this on its own.

*but with that being said*, it‚Äôs absolutely¬†***FANTASTIC***¬†as a layering scent. paired with something like kayali vanilla 28, it transforms into this warm, cozy, slightly sensual winter dream. it adds a beautiful depth and richness to sweeter fragrances, and for that reason, i‚Äôm actually really happy to have it in my collection. as a standalone fragrance, i‚Äôd rate it a 5/10. but as a layering fragrance, especially for the colder months, it easily jumps to an 8. i can‚Äôt wait to pull it out in winter and mix it with my favorites!

# floral pear 5/10

i had high hopes for this one. i kept seeing people describe it as the perfect clean girl scent, and that‚Äôs exactly what i was going for. and to be fair, it¬†*is*¬†clean ‚Äî very fresh, very light. but to me, it leans too far into that soapy territory. it doesn‚Äôt open up in a bright or fruity way like i expected. instead, it smells almost like a high-end bar of soap, which isn‚Äôt bad, but not something i personally want to wear.

in terms of the notes, i mostly got the pear right away, and a little bit of freesia. on the dry down, there‚Äôs a hint of musk, but i could barely detect any amber at all. again, i don‚Äôt even dislike this fragrance ‚Äî i just¬†*wanted*¬†to like it more. the overly soapy quality is what‚Äôs holding it back from being great in my opinion.

i haven‚Äôt tried the original english pear & freesia by jo malone, so i can‚Äôt say how close it is to that. i considered keeping it, but deep down i knew i wouldn‚Äôt reach for it over other scents i actually enjoy. it‚Äôs nice in theory, just not something that fits my style. 5/10

# powdery peach 6/10

this one is honestly a toss-up for me. it's inspired by jimmy choo i want choo and if it performs better and is more intense than powdery peach, i might have to get it. i have such a love-hate relationship with this perfume. i‚Äôve seen people online say it‚Äôs super strong, and even on the website it‚Äôs listed as a statement scent, but that wasn‚Äôt my experience at all. i found it to be really light ‚Äî sometimes i could barely smell it on my skin even after an hour.

it performs a little better on clothes, and there have been times where i‚Äôve caught a soft whiff and thought ‚Äúwait, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù only to realise it was powdery peach. but overall, i don‚Äôt find it to be intense or long-lasting. i don‚Äôt really get how it‚Äôs marketed as statement on their website‚Äôs scent intensity scale when it feels so subtle.

as for the scent itself, it‚Äôs very airy and citrusy with just the slightest hint of sweetness. it‚Äôs not too sharp or tangy like some citrus perfumes, which i actually appreciate. there‚Äôs a softness to it, the vanilla is barely there but gives it a touch of warmth and sweetness, while the blackcurrant and tangerine come through more clearly than the actual peach, which was i wasn‚Äôt expecting since i was hoping for something more peach-forward.

i actually really really like the smell of this fragrance, but its performance and longevity just lets it down for me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a case of I need to let it macerate for awhile before the intenseness really comes out, but as is, it‚Äôs a bit lighter than I would like, it‚Äôs also really powdery too which I guess is reflected in the name.

i really wanted to love this because i usually enjoy peach scents, but this just didn‚Äôt quite land for me. it‚Äôs not bad at all ‚Äî i‚Äôd probably give it a 6.5 out of 10 ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt leave much of an impression, and i‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôd reach for it often.

# ambery vetiver 6.75/10

i definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting this to smell the way it does, but honestly, i mean that in a good way. it‚Äôs fresh, citrusy, and clean ‚Äî exactly what it claims to be. it reminds me of an expensive hotel spa in the best way, and there‚Äôs something really calm and polished about it.

this isn‚Äôt usually my go-to scent profile since i tend to lean more toward deep, sweet, gourmand fragrances, especially anything with vanilla or warm notes. but i‚Äôve been trying to branch out and try new things, and this one has been growing on me more and more each day.

i‚Äôm really picking up all the notes in this ‚Äî the bergamot, lemon, and buchu up top give it that fresh, citrusy feel, while the orange blossom, marigold, and violet in the heart add some softness and complexity. the base of vetiver, amber, and cedarwood gives it just enough warmth and depth. even the cedarwood, which can sometimes be too much for me, is really subtle here, and that‚Äôs a good thing.

it‚Äôs inspired by byredo‚Äôs bal d‚Äôafrique, and i can absolutely see why this would be a go-to or everyday scent for a lot of people. it‚Äôs perfect for the office or any professional setting ‚Äî very clean and sophisticated without feeling stuffy or overly stuck up but instead more just ""put together""¬† it just gives class and elegance in a really effortless way. it wasn‚Äôt an instant favourite for me, but definitely something i‚Äôve come to appreciate and enjoy. 6.75/10

# dossier floral grapefruit 7/10

this one is definitely more sharp and citrusy than most of the fragrances i own, but that‚Äôs exactly what i was looking for when trying to explore this scent family. I really wanted something that absolutely emulated the clean girl aesthetic, something fresh, light and girly without being overpowering, i had previously tried tried floral pear before for this exact reason and didn‚Äôt really connect with it ‚Äî it was too bar soapy for me, and was much more of a skin scent. i‚Äôve always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with that one. sometimes i like it, sometimes i don‚Äôt.

floral grapefruit, on the other hand, leans stronger and sharper. it gives clean girl vibes in a more bold and noticeable way, which i really appreciate. it‚Äôs definitely more potent than floral pear, so if you prefer something more toned down and soft, that one might be a better fit. but for me, floral grapefruit strikes the right balance.

what i really love is how clear and well-blended the notes are ‚Äî i can pick up the grapefruit, pear, and blackcurrant right away. then the florals in the middle ‚Äî hyacinth, jasmine, and lilac ‚Äî come through softly, adding some brightness. as it dries down, the musk, amberwood, and orris settle in and give it more depth, which makes it feel more rounded and wearable.

overall, i‚Äôm really satisfied with this fragrance. i don‚Äôt absolutely¬†*looooove*¬†or¬†*adore*¬†it, and it‚Äôs not my favorite style of scent, but it does a great job representing this fresh, clean, citrusy category i wanted to add to my collection. solid 7.5/10.

# dossier fruity neroli 8/10

this one is inspired by armani's my way, and really rings true to the description on the website. it‚Äôs definitely a statement scent, and i can 100% see it being a crowd-pleaser. it leans more into the deep, fruity floral side rather than being light and fresh, and that‚Äôs exactly what i love about it.

it‚Äôs super sweet and sugary ‚Äî very girly and kind of gives off that playful, princess-like vibe. some people might find it a little youthful or borderline childish, but for me, it doesn‚Äôt cross that line. it just feels fun, feminine, and bold in the best way.

if you love sweet, fruity fragrances, this is a really safe blind buy. what stands out the most to me is the blackcurrant, strawberry, and tuberose ‚Äî they come through clearly in the opening and heart. but the vanilla and cedarwood in the base definitely round it out and give it more depth and creaminess, which keeps it from being too airy or simple.

overall, i actually really love this scent. the performance is strong, the projection is great, and it smells exactly like something i‚Äôd wear when i want to feel cute and confident. easily a solid 8/10.

# floral marshmallow 8.5/10

this one‚Äôs inspired by kilian‚Äôs love don‚Äôt be shy. don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî i¬†*reallyyyy*¬†like this scent, but it definitely caught me off guard. i‚Äôve never smelled the original, so i wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but based on the name, i assumed it would be super marshmallow-forward. instead, the first thing that hit me was citrus.

it‚Äôs still a beautiful scent ‚Äî soft, sweet, and very layered ‚Äî just not what i had in mind going into it. it‚Äôs less sugary than i expected, and sometimes i feel like i can barely smell the marshmallow at all. but now that i‚Äôve worn it a few times, i realize it¬†*is*¬†there ‚Äî it just gets a little overpowered by the bergamot and orange blossom, especially in the opening. but on the dry down the marshmallow comes out a bit more, just not enough in my opinion. the honeysuckle is tucked in there too, but it‚Äôs extremely subtle. the rest of the floral notes like jasmine and orris blend nicely, and the dry down with amber, vanilla, and musk brings warmth and smoothness.

i do wonder if letting it macerate for a couple of months it may become sweeter? but honestly i doubt it. i actually really appreciate how complex and layered this scent is. it‚Äôs not basic, and it definitely stands out in a soft, feminine way.

it‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt love this fragrance ‚Äî i do, which is why it‚Äôs rated so high on my list. but there‚Äôs just something slightly off about it to my nose. maybe it‚Äôs just that my expectations were so different. thinking it would be full-on sugary marshmallow , and instead getting something a bit more citrusy i think that threw me a bit. overall though, i still enjoy wearing it and look forward to seeing how it grows on me. i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôd repurchase just yet, but i‚Äôm really intrigued to smell the original now and see how they compare. 8.5/10

# ambery vanilla 9.5/10

my loveeee. this scent is everything to me. it‚Äôs sweet, warm, and so sensual ‚Äî the kind of fragrance that makes you want to close your eyes and just melt. it‚Äôs right up my alley as a vanilla-forward scent, It smells extremely similar to black opium which it is inspired by (but actually better imo as black opium is a bit too sharp and less creamy for me) but it surprised me as it also really reminded me of donna born in roma extradose.¬†

i was a little nervous about the coffee note at first, but thankfully it doesn‚Äôt stand out on my skin. if it‚Äôs there, it blends in beautifully and just adds a bit of depth to the overall scent rather than overpowering anything. everything feels cohesive, smooth, and balanced.

this is such a grown, mature kind of sweet ‚Äî not overly sugary or juvenile. it‚Äôs soft, sexy, and feminine without being too heavy. i know i‚Äôll never get tired of this one, and i‚Äôll definitely be repurchasing. it‚Äôs one of those scents i always want to have on hand. what really makes this fragrance shine for me are the notes. orange blossom really softens and rounds it out. the mandarin adds a bit of brightness in the opening, and while you can‚Äôt always pick out every note individually, you can definitely them working together to give the scent its depth and richness.

it‚Äôs creamy, yummy, girly, and a little bit seductive ‚Äî the perfect date night fragrance. the only reason i‚Äôm not giving it a full 10/10 is because it‚Äôs not super unique. i‚Äôve smelled many scents like this before, including the original, so it doesn‚Äôt feel groundbreaking ‚Äî but i absolutely adore it regardless.

# ambery saffron 10000/10

boy oh boy, i wish i could give this scent 100000 stars. this scent took me completely by surprise! both me and my boyfriend instantly fell in love with it the moment we smelled it. it‚Äôs just so warm, smooth, and addictive. i think it‚Äôs perfectly unisex, sweet enough for me to enjoy, but not so sweet that it leans overly feminine. it hits that perfect middle ground.

i wasn‚Äôt actually the biggest fan of baccarat rouge 540 when i first tried it, but to be fair, i only smelled it on a paper strip, so i probably didn‚Äôt give it a real chance. if this is as close as people say, then i completely understand the obsession now. this version just works so well on skin. it‚Äôs warm, spicy, and slightly sweet, with a really smooth amber base that becomes more noticeable as it dries down. and i love the hint of white floral in it! it‚Äôs soft and clean, not overpowering.

what surprises me most is that i‚Äôm usually not into woody or musky scents at all, but here, they‚Äôre done in a way that adds depth without being too much. it‚Äôs subtle but still gives the perfume that lasting power and structure. somehow everything just comes together so beautifully.

i haven‚Äôt even made a dent in my bottle but i‚Äôm already planning to buy three more. this is easily one of my favourite fragrances right now, comforting, elegant, and super wearable. it‚Äôs the kind of scent you just keep reaching for without even thinking.

anyways that‚Äôs it! i really hope this was somewhat helpful and gave you a bit more insight into what these perfumes actually smell like. overall, i do really love dossier and will definitely be buying more from them in the future. i‚Äôm not too worried about taking risks with new scents since their return process is super easy and straightforward.

let me know your thoughts ‚Äî whether you agree, disagree, or have a favourite i didn‚Äôt mention. i‚Äôd love to hear what you think!",2,1743190641.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

I am tired of buying the bottles, and decided it's time to figure out a solution to this. I don't want to spend the kind of money of doing a whole home system. My house is 90 years old, and as far as I know most of the delivery lines if not all of them are original to the house. we do not ingest the water from any of the faucets aside from showering and brushing teeth. What i've read is that if we were to invest in a whole home system with a softener the system will just pull the minerals from the pipes, and eventually cause pinholes.

I've decided it's best to go with an undersink filtration system. This will be our drinking water, cooking water, and coffee maker water. I would also like for the line to run to our refrigerator to make ice.

  
I started following Martin Riese on tiktok a while back and he suggests Aquasana as a good whole home system. The research I've done here on tiktok says that for the money aquasana is not worth it. I've seen some people say AO smith available at Lowes is the way to go, but I think I read somewhere that AO smith and Aquasana are the exact same thing.

for what it's worth the aquasana RO system is $220 [Aquasana RO system](https://www.aquasana.com/under-sink-water-filters/smart-flow-reverse-osmosis/chrome-100385796.html)

Ive seen other people recommend waterdrop and their systems are much pricier [waterdrop g3p600](https://www.waterdropfilter.com/collections/shop-by-scenario-cooking-drinking/products/waterdrop-reverse-osmosis-water-filtration-system)

‚ÄúWe brought Jonathan in to refine our messaging and add an extra edge to our campaign. He clearly knows his craft‚Äîhis insights on positioning and copy helped us make our offer more compelling. For example, he recommended incorporating exclusivity and urgency into our ad, which immediately made it more persuasive. Not only was he professional and easy to work with, but he was also generous with his expertise. The results spoke for themselves‚Äîwithin days, we saw a noticeable uptick in engagement and inquiries. If you want high-converting copy from someone who gets it, Jonathan is the guy to call.‚Äù

Now, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about. Results. Specificity. Action.

Here‚Äôs what I did differently:

Problem-Solution: I laid out the problem (our messaging wasn‚Äôt cutting it) and the solution (I came in and added that edge).

Concrete Example: Instead of just saying I‚Äôm great, I showed exactly how I helped‚Äîincorporating urgency and exclusivity.

Tangible Results: The money line‚Äî‚ÄùWithin days, we saw a noticeable uptick in engagement and inquiries.‚Äù That‚Äôs the part that makes people think, ‚ÄúDamn, this guy knows his stuff.‚Äù

Call to Action: A solid CTA because, let‚Äôs face it, that‚Äôs what gets clients to pick up the phone.

Why This Matters for Your Business

So here‚Äôs the kicker: Testimonials are powerful. But if you don‚Äôt guide your clients to give you the right feedback, you‚Äôre left with a nice, safe, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awesome‚Äù and not much else. And that‚Äôs like serving a burger with no toppings. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fine, but it could‚Äôve been so much better.
You need testimonials that sell‚Äîand that means you need to get your clients to be specific. If you let them ramble on without focus, you‚Äôll end up with fluff like this:
‚ÄúGreat work!‚Äù
‚ÄúSuper happy with the results!‚Äù
‚ÄúI love working with you!‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt a diary entry, people. We‚Äôre in the business of selling. You need details. You need proof. You need results.

Now, you might be thinking, ‚ÄúBut Jonathan, my clients aren‚Äôt copywriters. How am I supposed to get them to deliver the goods?‚Äù Easy.
You give them a simple, structured testimonial template that guides them through the process. No one wants to sit there wondering, ‚ÄúWhat do I say? Am I doing this right?‚Äù So you take the guesswork out of it.

The Secret Weapon: The Testimonial Feedback Form

Here‚Äôs a testimonial feedback form that you can send to your clients to make sure they hit all the right notes. Trust me, if you make it easy for them, they‚Äôll thank you for it‚Äîand you‚Äôll thank them when your sales skyrocket.

Customer Testimonial Feedback Form:

What was the challenge or problem you faced before working with us?
1. How did our service/product solve that problem? (Be specific!)
2. What specific results or improvements did you see after using our service/product? (e.g., increased sales, more customers, improved efficiency)
3. What was the most valuable part of working with us?
4. Why would you recommend us to others? (Get them to dig into the real benefits here!)

The Power of Specifics

A testimonial isn‚Äôt just a nice-to-have‚Äîit‚Äôs a marketing weapon. And when you guide your clients to give you specific feedback, you‚Äôre essentially creating a case study in real-time.
If you want to stand out, you‚Äôve got to show your potential clients what‚Äôs in it for them. Results, baby. That‚Äôs what sells.

So, get your clients to give you that gold mine of a testimonial. Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it. And if you need help crafting or optimizing your copy you know where to find me.",1,1743190488.0,copywriting,3,0.67,False

I‚Äôm not going to argue about it. üòÇ

I think that it‚Äôs hilarious that the 2 main people in ‚ÄúTophia‚Äôs lore‚Äù that was once against her, rightfully so, due to her own actions are now defending her. 

Aunt Karen made Tophia ‚Äúcry‚Äù ( I don‚Äôt think she was actually crying fr) on that live exposing her about the Asian Teen üåΩ, scamming, and etc. Now, she‚Äôs defending Tophia, justifying her actions for blaming the ‚Äúaudience‚Äù for not wanting to give Tophia money as if she isn‚Äôt a scammer and liar. Then saying that ‚Äúwe‚Äù had something to do with Donald Jr‚Äôs passing. Now, Aunt Karen wants to be Mother fking Teresa and be Tofupa‚Äôs ‚Äúsavior.‚Äù Tophia didn‚Äôt even like Aunt Karen, until now! üòÇ

I wish I would give Tophia my hard earned money. This is the same person who thinks that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre too good for a 9-5 job‚Äù and projects their own issues with working on to others. But, expects my ‚Äúlil 9-5 job‚Äù money to support them‚Ä¶ umm I think the FUCK not. 

TT is a free app, if Tophia wanted people to pay to watch her, she should‚Äôve made an OF account. 

Yes, I‚Äôm aware now that Aunt Karen wasn‚Äôt really that good of a person to begin with. 

Now, Squid‚Ä¶ She exposed Tophia for her uncleanliness, and other things, too. Her and Tophia went back and forth on TT causing this beef. Tophia even blamed Squidd for ‚Äúd0xxing her, but she was already living in that car for 2 weeks at that point. (I believe, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) 

Leading to Squid being harrassed, d0xxed, and stalked by Tophia and her brother. 

All of a sudden, Squidd wants to be mfking 2015 Shane Dawson with these wack ass conspiracy theories about Donald Jr‚Äôs passing. As if, it wasn‚Äôt already proven that this was a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. While somehow blaming Tophia. 

LIKE WHATTT who does that. Yes, the ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù of their living situation was all on Tophia because she refuses to get an actual job. If people aren‚Äôt saying ‚Äúhere take my money‚Äù Tophia does not want no parts in it. 

We all know that Tophia, isn‚Äôt that smart enough to hire a HITMAN to take her brother out‚Ä¶ Second of all, why would Tophia need to do that in the first place. Donald Jr, was the sole provider, he kept a job. He probably still would‚Äôve been working leading up to his passing, if that Jimmy John‚Äôs that he was working at didn‚Äôt close down. If it wasn‚Äôt for Donald Jr, Tophia would‚Äôve been living on the streets near some cr@ck alley. So, why would she want her brother dead? 

Tophia‚Äôs $20-100 a week or month is NOTHING even an INTERNSHIP pays more than that üò≠

Now apparently, Squidd is blocking or deleting comments of people criticizing her. (This is alleged, idk if it‚Äôs true or not) NAHH you inserted yourself into this, you should‚Äôve sat and drank your coffee. These are the same MF people that could‚Äôve put your life in danger. 

I‚Äôm all here for making your money, but best believe there would‚Äôve been another time for Squidd to insert herself in Tophia‚Äôs mess. 

I‚Äôm not saying that she can‚Äôt say anything because we‚Äôll have, but blaming her for DJ‚Äôs passing is wrong no matter if Tophia hopped out the car or not. 

Squid and Aunt Karen both said things about Tophia and her family that were true, so I‚Äôll give them that. Aunt Karen is a hypocrite, and Squidd is messy af üò≠. It‚Äôs the principle!

Aunt Karen We don‚Äôt owe her anything! How about she come live off of you? Okay, no? Ciao!

1jm3eoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jm3eoi/the_price_of_a_promotion_growth_or_a_golden_cage/,The Price of a Promotion: Growth or a Golden Cage?,"For the past nine months, I have worked at a small company with a workforce made up mostly of young professionals, a few in their mid-30s, and some beyond. In that time, I have watched people come and go at a dizzying pace. It‚Äôs like fashion‚Äîone day someone is in, the next they‚Äôre out.

I have seen firsthand why they leave. The leadership is uninspiring, management is suffocating, micro-management is rampant, and the work itself can feel mind-numbing. I would be lying if I said I haven‚Äôt struggled with the same frustrations. But unlike those who had the freedom to walk away, I have been tethered by circumstances‚Äîvisa restrictions, career aspirations, and the need to secure a better opportunity before making a move.

The weight of it all has been heavy. I‚Äôve cried, I‚Äôve been frustrated, and I‚Äôve felt my potential being stifled by policies and systems beyond my control. But through it all, I‚Äôve shown up. I‚Äôve adapted, maintained my professionalism, and given my best effort despite knowing that this job offers me little in return.

Lately, the struggle to retain employees has become more visible. More people are leaving, and faster than ever. Some of them started this journey with me, and now I watch them go, wondering when it will be my turn.

The ""Promotion"" Dilemma
Then today, I was called into my manager‚Äôs office. To no surprise, I was ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with a promotion‚Äîfrom my current role to a slightly senior version of it. A small salary bump came with it, and I was assured that my commitment and hard work had not gone unnoticed.

I accepted, humbly. Because if nothing else, I know I have earned it. I have worked tirelessly, remained open to change, and carried myself with respect and professionalism. On paper, I am overqualified for this job. But here I am, being given a title upgrade that, in reality, does little to change my circumstances.

And then came the real sting: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt offer you this other role because it requires a different level of authority and confidence‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not to say we don‚Äôt believe in your abilities.‚Äù

A contradiction wrapped in corporate diplomacy.

It made me wonder: Am I being recognized, or am I being retained? Is this a genuine step forward, or just a strategic move to keep me in place while others leave? I don‚Äôt want to be a placeholder. I don‚Äôt want to be someone they promote just to stabilize their workforce.

Yet here I stand at a crossroads, uncertain of what this moment truly means.

A Half-Filled Cup or a Half-Empty One?
Do I see this as a stepping stone, an opportunity to prepare for a future role they claim will open soon? Or do I fight harder to find a company that aligns with my skills, aspirations, and values?

A part of me whispers that this is a game of control, a tactic to keep me anchored while the storm of resignations rages on. Another part of me acknowledges that I have, indeed, progressed‚Äîeven if not in the way I imagined.

Perhaps the real lesson here is this: growth is not just about promotions, raises, or titles. Growth is about clarity. It‚Äôs about recognizing when a situation is serving you and when it is simply using you. It‚Äôs about knowing when to stay and when to leave.

So, where do I go from here?

For now, I will buy myself a nice coffee‚Äîextra caramel‚Äîas a toast to this milestone, however bittersweet it may be. But I will also remind myself that promotions are not the same as progress. A title is just a title if it doesn‚Äôt move me closer to where I want to be.

And when the right moment comes, I will take my next step‚Äînot out of fear or frustration, but with confidence and authority. The very qualities they claim I lack.

While the cafe's aesthetic was on point, the overall experience fell short of my expectations. Perhaps it was because i went there at night?

After 9 months dating he and his child moved in with me and my kids.

We were all close and the kids all called themselves siblings. Looking back maybe we moved too quickly but things felt right.

In the beginning he was very affectionate and we had a lot of intimacy. In the first few months he was always kissing me, wanting to cuddle, bringing me treats, and he would hold me and kiss my head softly and caress me until I fell asleep in his arms.

He would listen to my feelings and validate them. I thought I found this rare sensitive man I‚Äôd been dreaming of.

But things started changing. He would always try to walk away from me when we were kissing. He would kiss me goodnight and roll over. He wasn‚Äôt initiating sex and only wanted to touch me roughly or in public. If I tried to touch him, he would get annoyed and tell me to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù.

He was still doing lovely things like making me coffee and breakfast, bringing me treats, helping with the kids. So he would accuse me of arguing if I wanted to say something he did hurt me or bring up that the affection had changed and remind me all the things he was doing for me. Which I did appreciate!

He also was always secretive with his phone. He would put it down when I walked in the room and quickly pick it up when I walked out. He would hold it at an angle facing away from me and he would also turn off WiFi at my house. He also admittedly only has mostly female friends. We had a few arguments and I would demand to see his phone. One time he gave it to me and I scrolled through a few conversations at the top with him peering over my shoulder and so I got up and walked towards the bathroom and he jumped up and grabbed it from me quickly. He said it was a boundary of his and I needed to work on my trust issues.

I do have trust issues from a previous partner having a porn addiction and I‚Äôm very insecure about that.

Well one day a big argument came about and I do admit I did question him about some things in his past I didn‚Äôt fully understand and things I knew he was insecure about. I accused him of not giving me the full story and he was hurt because he felt he had given me what parts of the story he knew and he admitted he didn‚Äôt fully understand the situations. I knew these things were touchy subjects for him.

Well I got upset and I said let me look through your phone or we‚Äôre done. He refused and after me repeating it several times. He packed up his kid, said goodbye to my kid and left. He still owns his home so they just went back home.

Shortly after we talked. I admitted I was insecure and it was a violation of privacy. He was angry by the things I said but said he had nothing to hide on his phone. We continued to live separately after that incident though.

He would tell me how much he missed the kids though and wanted to work on being back together. But I was still struggling a lot with the fact that he chose to pack up his kid and leave rather than let me look at his phone.

So in the meantime we‚Äôve both said some not great things to each other and caused more hurt and we are taking a break. He wants me to validate he‚Äôs hurt that he‚Äôs missing out on the kids but I can‚Äôt get over him being the one to choose walking out.

I know me looking at his phone, wouldn‚Äôt have solved my trust issues, I freely offered him my phone every time I asked for his.

Did he leave because he was hiding something? I think that me demanding the phone speaks truth that I‚Äôm not ready for a serious relationship and I can handle that.

Woke up. Checked weather. Fourty percent chance of rain today, definitely raining tomorrow. 'I've hitchiked through weather once or twice... but why bother? I'm not exactly on a schedule.' 

New plan. Check out the anchoring/mooring ball/marina/land access, hit a new feed, check out any services/information they might have, library to charge, back to camp.

Twenty-five minute walk for coffee, another fifteen to the bus stop. On bus. Downtown transit center. Find the bus that will get me near the water. Over to appropriate bus parking spot. Smoke. Coffee. On bus.

Meandering over the bridge I see everything I want to. Mooring balls on one side, Anchored boats on the other. Plenty of room for one more boat in the spots I picked out on Navionics a while back.

I'd probably get a mooring ball, but they want me to pay for it and be rafted up with another boat, or boats. Personally, I like my privacy. And having another persons boat, and another person or persons, right on top of me sounds like the worst way to live on a boat. Especially when it blows.

All that aside, this is where I'm thinking of bringing the boat next. Looked good to me. I still have to rustle up a dinghy. And it will take a little money to stock the boat for the trip, but that's why I'm out looking for some work...

Wages seem better here, and the town seems like it is a better place to get on your feet. Possibly even if you're looking to restore a boat while living on it.

The new feed/resources/information got curtailed by the fact there are two of the same place, I was looking at the wrong one so different bus moves were made... I had limited time due to the aforementioned adventuring while coming from five miles out of town, and the coffee chased with water which was working some magic.

Flashback to two nights ago...

Back to camp around sundown. Usual digging the days tools and equipment out of my pockets, munching a cuban from publix. Pick a movie. Get comfortable in the tent. I hear about fourteen gunshots. Not in the smallish area of woods I'm in, but pretty close. I grew up a little north of L.A. We had a couple gangs. I'm no stranger to gunfire. I didn't think much of it. Right back to watching a movie.

An hour or so later I here someone calling a woman's name. Sounds like he lost a dog, but I am out in the woods... I've seen some shit occasionally... A few calls and that's it.

A while later I happen to see a flashlight at the next camp up from mine. These guys have been the quietest, stealthiest people to camp near. To the point we've both seen eachother and haven't actually run into eachother on a pretty short path we both use near the entrance to the woods. 

I'm pretty secluded and there's a good amount of distance between us, but there's this one tiny spot through the trees and bushes between us that I can sometimes see the flash of a t-shirt or, very rarely, a flashlight.

A little more flashlight than usual, but someone's probably looking for something. None of my concern. Movie paused. Smoke lit. A few minutes later I see a couple flashlights coming down the mutual trail. No big deal. Take a drag. Watch lights bounce in the dark. I see a little light move across my tent where it finds it's way through the leaves and branches. Pretty normal. The light comes back. More light. On my tent. Unsure foot steps coming down the unused and hidden path to my tent. It's fuckin' bright now. Nine-thirty at night, and my tent is lit up like I'm in the middle of a South Carolina lightning storm.

""How ya doin'? Sheriff's Department."" ""How's it going?"" ""We heard some gun shots over here, we know there's people back here so we were just checking to make sure everyone is alright. Did you hear any gunshots around here?"" ""Yeah, about an hour ago. About ten, eleven, twelve shots."" ""Yeah that's what we heard. Do you happen to have your ID on you?"" ""Yeah... Here you go."" He runs it. ""Normally when we find people out here we hand off their name to our social services people and they come out and offer some help."" ""I'm leaving in the morning. I'm just hitchhiking through."" My ID comes back clean enough that they hand it back. ""Other than that knife right there do you have any other weapons in there?"" ""No."" A half-hearted, ""Anything else you shouldn't have in there? No drugs, guns..."" I laugh. Granted I've been making sure the dab pen still works... ""Nope. No dead bodies..."" They laugh, offer to pass my name to the homeless outreach people again, and wish me a good night.

I'm perplexed. The cops just walked up on my pretty secluded tent. Not impossible to find, but in the dark... (They probably just know where everybody camps. There's only so many places in beach towns that are anywhere near anything you will need.) Didn't search me. Didn't tell me to kick rocks. Offered me help. And then told me to have a good night. And left. That had me dumbfounded. To the point I didn't leave the next morning. 

Technically, I am looking for a better spot to live than where the boat is now/looking for a place to work and live on the boat while I restore it. 'Could this be the place? I've been planning to come down here since roughly August... Maybe they have what I need to get started...'

Back to today...

I'm going to keep things relatively short and sweet for the sake of brevity. I've got two characters i want to do a little more with, so I'm going to give a brief prompt for the setting, then what I'm looking for.

Taking place in the modern era is a town that is home to humans, cryptids, witches, warlocks and more. There are heroes and villains but mostly people just wanting to live their normal lives. On one street corner an ancient Djinn may be running a coffee shop and next door could be a jewelry store run by a shape-shifting dragon.

Otoro Darkheart and Sophie Barca live in this town and are the two characters and are who I will be playing.

Otoro is a carpenter/woodworker, and he's also a Wolf that has lived most of his life as a man. Recently he's found his other half. Your character is an old friend moving to town or a new face entirely. She can be a wolf also, a Werewolf would be awesome or human. 

Sophie was born from the head of a son of Zeus during a city run Halloween festival. She is a two-spirited person, quite literally as she has the soul of an alternate version of herself sharing her body. Your character (ideally a man for Sophie but I'm not against FxF for her/them) can be a plain old human or another demigod.

Both plot lines are going to have their own forms of turmoil, with Otoro's conflicts coming from his nature. Sophie's will stem from a lot of violence either others. Both can have romance, I don't mind!

My wife and I (early 30s) are planning to move from Charlotte, NC to Minneapolis some time this summer. We're big literature nerds, former teachers, coffee lovers, love to cook and bake, board and video games, and all things creative. We‚Äôve visited in January, February, and May over the last year or two and really fell in love with the lakes, biking infrastructure, and walkability relative to Charlotte and to the suburb where I grew up in Texas. Everyone has been extraordinarily welcoming each time we go up, and currently we are interested in the South Uptown/Harriet/King Field area along Bryant.

Before the chaos of the move, I wanted to start reaching out and seeing about making some connections, especially since I am self-employed. My one-man small business designs and creates custom leather goods such as wallets, watch straps, belts, keychains, and bags. I focus on luxury materials from trusted tanneries in Italy and the US and high-quality brass, stainless steel, and canvas with functional, modern designs. There is also a significant educational aspect to what I do, from filming YouTube tutorials and uploading patterns to teaching in-person leather classes and private lessons.¬†

A large portion of my business is direct-to-consumer through my website (not listing here so as to honor the sub rules about selling) or at pop-ups, where clients can choose their accessory‚Äôs style, layout, leather, color, thread, personalization, etc., but I also offer B2B services, including collaborations, resale, and private label.¬†

What I would love is if you or someone you know would like to connect, whether you‚Äôre just curious about the world of leather and handmade goods, you have ideas bouncing around, or you‚Äôve got some recommendations for business or pleasure!¬†

Obviously, I‚Äôll be thrilled to hear from anyone here, but especially if:

\-You already do leathercraft and would like to chat/join forces

\-You are interested in learning leathercraft for fun or professionally¬†

\-You have a business and either just want to connect (I love talking with folks about their work!), or have an idea for products

\-There‚Äôs a niche service/product that you would like to see filled locally

Charlotte has been good to us for the last 2 years, but we‚Äôre excited for our next chapter in Minnesota and I can't wait to start contributing to Minneapolis however we can! Please feel free to comment or send me a chat about whatever!

1jm2zzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheKameena/comments/1jm2zzg/aitk_for_wanting_to_distance_myself_from_this/,AITK for wanting to distance myself from this friend?,"So, I (21F) have this friend from medical college, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúM.‚Äù We‚Äôve known each other since our first year, and while she can be fun at times, over the years, I‚Äôve realized she is incredibly selfish. It‚Äôs starting to get on my nerves to the point where I feel like I‚Äôm just tolerating her at this point.

It started with small things‚Äîshe gatekeeps study materials and refuses to share notes or important information while happily taking help from others. But then I started noticing it in other aspects of our friendship.

For example, my other friend and I often buy a pattice (a snack with 4-5 pieces, where the middle piece is the best) every alternate day. We‚Äôre usually starving when we get it, and we share it between the two of us. But M always ends up taking the biggest portion‚Äîeven though she carries a full lunchbox every day. When we ask for even a small bite of her food, she refuses, saying she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo hungry‚Äù to share.

She also frequently comes over to my place to study since we live in the same society. One time, my mom made her an entire spread‚Äîsamosas, dhokla, fruits, coffee‚Äîbecause she was visiting, and M barely ate anything. More than half of it was wasted, which really annoyed my mom. But when I visited her house and stayed for over 12 hours, she didn‚Äôt even offer me water. At one point, I asked her what the plan was for dinner, and she bluntly told me I should go home and eat.

It‚Äôs not just food; she also has this weird entitlement to my belongings. When she‚Äôs at my place, she uses my things without asking‚Äîlip balm, lipstick, hand cream, my hairbands. She takes pictures with my stuff, like switching on my kitty lamp just to take photos with it. She‚Äôll even open drawers randomly and go through my things.

One time, she didn‚Äôt have a scrunchie, so I lent her one and specifically told her to return it because it was my mom‚Äôs. She conveniently took it home, wore it on multiple occasions, and I only got it back after repeatedly asking for it‚Äîby then, it was in terrible condition. This happens a lot with other things too, like lip balms.

She also has a superiority complex when it comes to academics. She loves it when I score lower than her‚Äîshe actively tells people how happy she is that she did better than me. She also makes backhanded comments about my background‚ÄîI‚Äôm North Indian, and she‚Äôs a Marathi Brahmin. She often says things like, ‚ÄúOh, you guys don‚Äôt study that much anyway,‚Äù which makes me feel bad about where I come from.

Then there‚Äôs the issue of driving. Almost every time we go out, I‚Äôm the one driving. She expects it, doesn‚Äôt split costs, and throws tantrums if I say I don‚Äôt want to drive. If I ever ask her to pay me back for something, she acts like it‚Äôs ridiculous‚Äî‚ÄúWhy do you want me to return your money? It‚Äôs just 100-200 rupees.‚Äù But when it comes to her money, she‚Äôll chase me down for even five rupees.

The worst part? She has some genuinely gross habits. One time, we were sharing a chips packet, and she took a chip, wiped all the masala off her finger in her mouth, and then put her saliva-covered finger back into the packet. I felt so disgusted I couldn‚Äôt eat after that. Another time, she was pulling her hair constantly in my room‚Äîprobably an anxiety thing‚Äîbut she shed more than 100 strands all over my bed and side table. She has extreme dandruff, and I had to clean everything with Dettol afterward because it was everywhere.

She also talks behind my back while pretending to agree with me in person. In first year, I was struggling with a subject and asked her for help, but she said, ‚ÄúCan we not ask each other for help? I need to focus on my own stuff.‚Äù But now that she‚Äôs struggling with a subject, she comes to me for help‚Äîand I still help her because I know how hard med school is. But it‚Äôs starting to feel like she‚Äôs just taking advantage of me.

The most frustrating incident happened during our practical exams. She stayed at my house for four consecutive days during exam time. My parents were more than happy to host her, and she took full advantage of it. But when I finally went over to her place after her repeatedly insisting, I barely stayed for an hour before her dad basically told me to leave, saying, ‚ÄúYou need to learn to study on your own.‚Äù Imagine your daughter staying at someone‚Äôs house for days, eating their food, using their space, but you won‚Äôt even let that same friend stay at your place for a little while. It made me feel completely unwelcome.

Honestly, I feel drained. She takes so much from me‚Äîmy time, my things, my space‚Äîbut never gives back. Outside of these incidents, she can be fun, which is why I‚Äôve put up with it for so long. But at this point, I don‚Äôt know if I should even continue this friendship.",4,1743189140.0,AmItheKameena,3,1.0,False
1jm2zlk,https://i.redd.it/iwoesyi7chre1.png,How Do People Feel About the (New) Hidden Attachments Feature?,"I noticed today that my txn attachments are no longer being displayed. Previously, there would be little icons of the attachments. Now there are just random numbers (see image). 

For me, seeing the small attachment icons allowed me to quickly see details about the attachment (when I buy or sell something on eBay, I attach a photo for easy/quick recall). Now I can no longer do this. 

I reached out to customer service and they said it was a ""security issue"" because these little photos could be displaying something sensitive if a user used monarch in a public space like a coffee shop. 

That explanation didn't make sense to me, because ALL of Monarch is sensitive and confidential. I wouldn't display any of my Monarch app publicly, with or without attachment images. 

I'm curious how other people use attachments and if they like or dislike this downgrade/upgrade. ",2,1743189111.0,MonarchMoney,1,1.0,False

F4 end-stage fibrosis aka Cirrhosis due to HBV, non alcoholic.

MELD score: 6

After received the shocking news. I changed everything.
- I reduced sugar/glucose intake to almost 0. No more rice, noodle, sweet, coffee with condensed milk, nothing. 

- I only ate little red meat, mostly chicken breast, tofu, green vegetables such are broccoli, cabbage, green leaf veggies.
- No more staying up late. 
- Quit smoking (1 pack/day before)
- Started going to the gym 5 or 6 days/week. 50-60 minutes on treadmill with maximum incline level. Burnt roughly 1000kCal/day. Some lifting (15-20 minutes) everyday before the treadmill.
- Started prolonged fasting: 2 x 36 hours, 3 days, 6 days, 10 days.
- Rotating 16:8 and OMAD

Last year, I was 310lbs. 
Jan 2025: I was 270lbs (Thanks to 2 months of Mounjaro and OMAD)
Mar 2025: Now I am 225lbs. And my blood sugar is in a stable good range without insulin injections.
Aiming to lose 20-30 more lbs.

I just had another Fibroscan yesterday.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a novice to intermediate coffee maker, and I mostly make espresso (Americanos, and occassionally Lattes) but occasionally do pour-over as well. I‚Äôm currently using an OXO burr grinder, but I‚Äôve ordered a Baratza Encore ESP to step up my game. However, I‚Äôve come across the DF54 and am now stuck between the two.

My Question:
	‚Ä¢	For espresso, which grinder would give me better results?
	‚Ä¢	If I‚Äôm doing pour-over occasionally, would the DF54 still work well for that, or would it be too finicky to switch between espresso and pour-over settings?
	‚Ä¢	How much coffee dose can the DF54 handle? I typically grind around 18-20g for espresso, and I don‚Äôt want to overload it - but when I do pour over I grind like 30-40g of coffee; how would that work?

I've been thinking about food and coffee places I went to years ago that have long since closed (Sureshot. .. citra...) and one that escapes me is this place on the Ave I swear existed. I bought huge crepes from there years ago before I moved properly to Seattle (lived in Kitsap prior to 2017.) I just could never remember where it was, just that the building it was in was very narrow like a hallway.

Was watching a J. Kenji L√≥pez-Alt YouTube review of Nasai Teriyaki on the Ave, and had a very extreme sense of deja vu. I swear the layout is the same as my memories of the crepe place, but for some reason I thought Nasai was one of those decades old Ave shops.

okay where do i start

i was friends with this one girl, her name was lets say... ella lmfao. we had a rocky beginning cuz we met when her friend was beefing with my friend in the 8th grade and we all got put in a groupchat for it, classic 8th grade shit and when i saw her account, she had the style and aesthetic i wanted or whatever. we slowly started talking and getting to know each other from there on, we didnt become friends until the 10th grade.

she has a notorious reputation, her bpd was really bad and she was an alcoholic but me being me i was like... there must be more to the story and i believe that anyone could have a good heart and be a good person so we became friends.¬†

by the time we were really close, she was a substance user, not weed, not nicotine, but actual opiods and pills she would snort. me being me again, knowing i had really bad depression and BAD symptoms of bipolar disorder, i was like ""hey! mental health shouldnt define a person!"" so i defended her, i was her only friend and man was i dragged in the mud because of it, but i didnt care because we were friends and thats what friends were for. she WAS a really nice girl and a decent person. it was then she started dating an old friend of mine where it all started going wrong.¬†

my school is a somewhat really hard academic school, they take all that shit seriously and a lot of students in my school have gotten into top unis in the country but since she had really bad mental health and was previously transferred from an alternative school so you could see where that went wrong. she skipped classes and all that, we ate lunch down the street at the local gas station since she didnt want to see anyone in our grade (for context, she went to elementary school with some kids and they bullied her and treated her like shit blah blah u get the deal).¬†

it got so much worse from there, i dont think i can describe everything.¬†

because even if my friend needed help so badly and had to resort to using to numb her pain, i understood that pain and i empathized with her because i myself, am i¬† addict¬† too but man did it get too much. the codependency, the constant carrying of her baggage, it was too much. i had to leave and it would be better if i did because mentally, i wasn't fine either. i needed help too but she would never be there to help since she was so occupied with her addiction and her mental health, she dropped me for the worst fucking reasons. i did everything i can to help her and support her but she just kept denying it (to the fact she skipped therapy and¬† narcotics anonymous ). i've been getting better and i've been healing, accepting myself blah blah blah whatever. the thought just lingers because i myself have mental health issues¬† (literally i have undiagnosed bipolar and its so bad) . as much as i wanted to help her, i couldn't, maybe i feel a bit of guilt for not doing enough or sometimes thinking REALLY poorly about her but that was the reality of it. she was such a shitty person towards me and it's great she's out of my life but it just seems.. a bit blurred

like obviously i smoke way too much but that's different, she was addicted to¬† literal opioids¬† and i too, have dabbled in some of the stuff she did, she had me do a ton of¬† LITERAL SUBSTANCES , yes ik i can decide on my own but just... eugh the lines were so blurred around her

i felt so bad for enabling her sometimes, she asked me if i was fine with her snorting beside me and i said yes, i dont know why. i told her so many times ""its up to you to get sober"" but she ran with it.¬†

I LITERALLY STARTED SNORTING SHIT UP BECAUSE OF HER AND I WAS SO HIGH IN CLASS THAT I WOULDNT REMEMBER DOING MY FUCKING CALC PRACTICE PROBLEMS ON TESTS and i knew i had a choice but i couldnt even function at that point.¬†

when she dropped me, she claims that i dont value her as a friend so she let me go. hello miss girl, i ruined my reputation at school, got my ass dragged through the dirt to hell and back for you, i was always there to answer the phone and ur messages, i did fucking everything for her and she tells me i didnt value her. i always made sure that in some situations, she came first because of her mental healthbut oh boy was i wrong. she got me on hard substances (i passed out at a sushi restaurant, threw up in a coffee shop, then passed out in a park), used me as a punching bag for all her problems, she literally made fun of me getting raped cuz it wasnt ""really¬† sa cuz i did it to myself"" and everytime i need her reassurance or im going through smth she doesnt fucking respond and ghosts me until something abt her pops up. i was so done with her, thank god she dropped me but her audacity to do so irks me. i did everything for her just for her to be like ""yea u dont see me as a friend anyway"" fuck that hoe im so done with this

or everytime i would have a problem she'll respond 20% of the time but it feels like a fucking robot talking to me

she complains abt boys not liking her when they always do but i never get any play. she gets so many compliments on the streets when we hangout and ppl seem to care abt her more than me anyway so ugh i fucking hate her ass.¬†

what i hate the most is that she's thriving after fucking me over so bad. ive been in a slump for so long, im slowly healing though, but her life is back together when she fucking teared me up into shreds. she claimed that if you were going through something, hit her up but she shat on me so much i couldnt do shit anymore. im slipping away at school and ive been in the worst headspace since she fucked me up.¬†

god, my life had been ruined because of her, im slowly healing but the world ended when it happened to me because im fucking stuck.¬†",1,1743188490.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1jm2q42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jm2q42/does_pregnancy_mean_losing_friends/,Does pregnancy mean losing friends?,"I'm currently 27 weeks pregnant. I‚Äôve never had many ""close"" friends, but I had about five really, really close girlfriends and two guy friends I‚Äôve known for years. We‚Äôre all around 25 years old. One of them had her first baby five years ago, and I‚Äôm the next. She‚Äôs probably the only one I can talk to about pregnancy-related stuff, which I really appreciate and love her for, but that's not the issue here.

The problem is that, for example, one of these girls, my now ex best friend I guess, whom I knew for almost 15 years, started becoming more and more distant. Now, she doesn‚Äôt even text me back anymore. I tried to meet up with her for coffee or lunch during my pregnancy, but she never found the time for me. Yet, she makes time for other friends. When she celebrated her birthday, she didn‚Äôt invite me because apparently, I can't drink with her friends. (I had been invited to all her birthdays since I‚Äôve known her.) Her reasoning was that I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it if everyone else was drinking and I wasn‚Äôt.

My other friends do talk to me, but sometimes I feel like if I don‚Äôt reach out to update them on how I‚Äôm feeling or how the baby is doing, they probably wouldn‚Äôt ask.

So my question is, is this just my experience, or am I being too sensitive? What is your experience?

Side note: All of them know that I‚Äôve been alone a lot and have spent most of my pregnancy by myself due to my husband‚Äôs work in the military. At some point, I was struggling mentally a lot as well.

The biggest thing preventing me from pursing a master's degree is the financial burden as I don't know how I will be able to afford the tuition and living expenses. I am wondering if taking out loans and going into debt will pay off in the end (getting me a good paying job).

I found myself cheering for Diana, the character who anchored the comedy of all the foolishness madly swirling about her, reckless decisions being made by the youngers and the supposed grownup of Charles. It was Diana who provided a nuanced response, a well-timed beat, an end-of-day self-reflection on how she must continue to best care for herself, perhaps in a way we long-single adult women learn to do: to provide for ourselves some creature comforts and some safety in routine. Really, didn‚Äôt Diana have it pretty good for herself? A clean and cozy and specific favorite chair, a throne in which she could read and read and enjoy her polished space and towering view of NY. Yes, her character was funny in her expressions, be it verbal or via eyeroll or in her statement necklaces, but she was also sane. Like, everyone in that office in Empirical was spinning around her, bumping into each other and their authors, and she provided the cornerstone, the solid, seated and caffeinated sage at the desk at the window. And just like Diana kept it together for this cast of characters at the workplace, I think Maggie (Debi Mazar‚Äôs hostess to their out-of-office shenanigans) provided the anchor in these ‚Äúoutie‚Äù scenes. So, yes (how could you not?) I always appreciated a scene with Lauren, I feel the show needed Diana and Maggie. And this is why in season seven of ‚ÄúYounger,‚Äù I realized I was kinda lonely for Diana. In her absence (while she was honeymooning with Enzo in Italy, and good for her ‚Äì with still 220 days of back vaca!) the show lost something. It‚Äôs like they were all being idiots, and she wasn‚Äôt there to let them know ‚Äì even if with just a raised eyebrow, and a call for coffee. Knowing that, first coffee, then decisions -- and unlike the rest of those kooks, with their broad declarations and overreactions and hasty decisions and phone calls answered without delay or pause or thoughtful response. So.

# 8 Great Noir Thrillers

Sara Gran ‚Äî whose 2003 novel of demonic possession, ‚ÄúCome Closer,‚Äù is a cult favorite ‚Äî recommends her favorites.

Sara Gran is the founder of Dreamland Books and the author of, most recently, ‚ÄúLittle Mysteries.‚Äù

March 24, 2025

Some people use noir to mean a spare writing style; others, a type of plot that tends toward deceit and despair. But it‚Äôs maybe best described as a place where no one wants to end up, literally or metaphorically.

It‚Äôs probably my favorite genre. I first got into noir through my father‚Äôs Black Lizard Press paperbacks. My father was not a criminally-minded man, but he gave me what every writer needs: good taste and a difficult childhood. Miss you, Dad.

These books will thrill you enough that you ought not to start them before bedtime ‚Äî you won‚Äôt want to stop. But don‚Äôt look for happy endings here, or inspiration, unless you, too, want to be a be a writer whose work leaves people shellshocked.

**The Black Dahlia** By James Ellroy

This sprawling masterpiece about two Los Angeles police officers and the desires that drive and bind them was inspired by the real Black Dahlia: Elizabeth Short, found murdered and mutilated in Leimert Park in 1947, nicknamed for the floral tattoo on her thigh.

The case has never been solved, and there are a few books out there by people who think their own father was the killer. Ellroy‚Äôs father is in the clear, but his mother, Jean Hilliker, was murdered in 1958, and the two unsolved cases are forever linked in Ellroy‚Äôs psyche.

His gloriously excessive style brings his fantasy of midcentury Los Angeles to brilliant, glittering, hyper-violent life, and his personal obsession with the Black Dahlia case shines through on every page.

**Miami Purity** By Vicki Hendricks

In 1995, Vicki Hendricks reinvigorated the genre with her humid, heated, gender-swapped take on ‚ÄúThe Postman Always Rings Twice.‚Äù Sherri Parlay, a good woman with a high libido, is seduced into murder by the beguiling heir to a dry-cleaning fortune. Soon, she finds that there‚Äôs more to him than his good looks and sexual skills.

After 30 years, no one has topped Hendricks‚Äôs take on female lust, and she remains the queen of Florida crime writers, with an understanding of the social ecosystem like no one else.

**Parishioner** By Walter Mosley

Xavier Rule has a violent past, but he doesn‚Äôt want that to be his future. Where to turn except a church made up of people who are even worse than he is, all of them trying to redeem themselves, and held to strict standards by their leader, Father Frank?

When Frank asks Xavier to help another parishioner sort out her own sordid past, Xavier‚Äôs faith will be tested. Mosley is fearless and as incisive as a scalpel in his examination of evil ‚Äî personal, spiritual, and institutional ‚Äî and surprisingly hopeful about the possibility of overcoming it.

**Creation Lake** By Rachel Kushner

The cool, disdainful narrator of this literary thriller about an undercover agent among eco-activists and neo-primitivists is noir personified ‚Äî and a character so strongly drawn you‚Äôll find yourself thinking in her voice. She needs nothing, has an opinion on everything (often a correct one), and a heart for no one. Fittingly, the book takes place among the French, who realized what we Americans had with our black-and-white crime narratives before we did. That‚Äôs why we call it noir.

**Shella** By Andrew Vachss

The darkest book on this list, ‚ÄúShella‚Äù shocks from the first page both for its content and its unbelievably spare, direct prose. Ghost, a killer for hire, searches for his lost love, a stripper who may have turned serial killer, in the darkest corners of the underworld. There‚Äôs a tactile, pre-internet urban grit in this book that feels nostalgic and thrilling. Vachss excels at giving a real point of view and dimension to some of the most disturbing characters in modern fiction; you will be surprised to find yourself rooting for Ghost and Shella, and you‚Äôll miss them when you turn the last page.

**Gringos** By Charles Portis

Portis, also the author of ‚ÄúTrue Grit,‚Äù has a plain-spoken style that is perfect for this violent descent through Mexico‚Äôs Yucat√°n; his flawless prose and eye for detail bring me back to this book over and over.

American expat Jimmy Burns has made a life of sorts for himself in Mexico, although he isn‚Äôt exactly embedded: ‚ÄúOnce again there had been no scramble among the hostesses of M√©rida to see who could get me for Christmas dinner.‚Äù Alone and aimless, he looks for a lost friend among a sinister cult. The search will bring out his most brutal impulses ‚Äî and a sliver of heroism.

**They Shoot Horses, Don‚Äôt They?** By Horace McCoy

Robert Syverten is a fresh-faced young man hoping to make it as a film director in Hollywood during the Depression ‚Äî until he meets aspiring actress Gloria Beatty, one of the most grating, grueling and unforgettable characters ever set in ink. Hungry and broke, they join a dance marathon together. What could go wrong? The opposite of the Hollywood success story, this tale goes in one direction only ‚Äî straight down ‚Äî and announces its trajectory from the opening page.

**The Expat** By Hansen Shi

Michael Wang, the narrator of this slim espionage tale, lives in every crime writer‚Äôs (or at least this writer‚Äôs) dream location: a loft above a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown.

By day he works for General Motors developing a self-driving car, so alienated from his peers that they hardly notice when he flies to China for a week. By night he freelances as a hacker and admires the expensive coffee maker and stereo he hopes will make him happy.

Shi brings the noir thriller to the modern world of tech, weaving in corporate absurdity, Asian American identity and the ways families inadvertently recreate their failures. A note of hope almost disqualifies ‚ÄúThe Expat‚Äù from this list, but its brutally sharp style and downward trajectory firmly plant its flag.",12,1743187891.0,books,1,0.93,False

Here is the full text:

By most metrics, *With Love, Meghan,* Meghan Markle‚Äôs new Netflix lifestyle series, would be considered a moderate success. It debuted in Netflix‚Äôs global top ten earlier this month and has already been renewed for a second season. Some of the items featured on the show, like a Le Creuset pan and a [belted shirtdress from S√©zane](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a63868440/with-love-meghan-markle-best-outfits-shop/), have already sold out online. The day the show premiered, Markle also previewed her long-awaited lifestyle brand, As Ever, a line of jams, teas, and her trademark edible-flower sprinkles developed in partnership with Netflix.

But for many of Markle‚Äôs biggest haters, the show was a prime opportunity to revisit their rancor. On social media, Markle‚Äôs ‚Äú[the biggest phony on the planet](https://x.com/unreMARKLEble/status/1875548325090316715),‚Äù ‚Äú[a narcissistic sociopath](https://x.com/TDT_Pod/status/1898425648642658449),‚Äù and ‚Äú[the human equivalent of a knockoff handbag ‚Äî shiny until you spot the loose stitching](https://x.com/CandidCoverage/status/1893091267925725607).‚Äù Conservative influencers like Brett Cooper blasted her for being ‚Äúfake, contrived, and inauthentic,‚Äù while Megyn Kelly [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m72lYuMxLV4) she was ‚Äúthe most insecure person I have seen in the public eye in a long time.‚Äù To judge from these reactions, you‚Äôd think Markle was guilty of a far greater crime than simply making a mediocre TV show.

Markle‚Äôs feud with the British royal family ‚Äî whom she accused of colluding with the British media to smear her in the press and of turning a blind eye to her mental-health issues ‚Äî cemented her as a liar and a narcissist in the eyes of her haters.¬†‚ÄúMeghan‚Äôs entire persona is built on exaggerations and self-victimization,‚Äù one detractor wrote on X earlier this month. In a *Brett Cooper Show* episode about Markle, Cooper said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve genuinely had enough with your constant victimhood while simultaneously contributing to your own problems and your own plight as you parade around in front of us with a product this fake, contrived, and inauthentic.‚Äù

Now people are comparing her to Blake Lively, who last year filed a civil suit against *It Ends With Us* director Justin Baldoni, alleging that he sexually harassed her and fostered a ‚Äúhostile work environment‚Äù on set and subsequently spearheaded an online harassment campaign against her. Like Markle‚Äôs allegations against the royal family and the British media, there is nothing terribly outlandish or unbelievable about Lively‚Äôs claims, yet people have responded to them as if they are obvious lies. More than that: They‚Äôve responded with outrage.

There is now an entire cottage industry of TikTokers and gossip vloggers attempting to publicly discredit Lively. Tellingly, [most of her detractors are women](https://www.glamour.com/story/inside-the-blake-lively-hate-campaign-fueled-by-mommy-sleuths); many, like the notorious conspiracy theorist and antisemite Candace Owens and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, are explicitly right-wing. In one episode of her podcast, Kelly uses a rather anodyne clip of Lively talking about her desire to transition from acting to writing and directing as evidence of her nature as a ‚Äúserial fraudster,‚Äù accusing her of signing onto the film under false pretenses to wrest creative control from Baldoni. On the internet, it seems, being female and slightly annoying is now a far greater offense than being accused of sexual misconduct.

‚ÄúMeghan Markle & Blake Lively have skated through life without facing any real consequences, which is why they feel entitled to bully and manipulate others,‚Äù reads one tweet. ‚ÄúBoth of them have allowed unchecked egos and a complete lack of accountability to harm those around them.‚Äù Another wrote of Markle and Lively, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying age-old techniques to win people over, but they forgot that people have access to social media now and can see the truth. They don‚Äôt get influenced by social media facades.‚Äù

Tellingly, plenty of people have also started (unfavorably) [comparing](https://twitter.com/drugproblem/status/1890188578208247812) Markle and Lively with [Amber Heard,](https://twitter.com/MandySlutsker/status/1870685583456207024) who accused her ex-partner Johnny Depp of sexual assault and physical abuse, leading Depp to sue her for defamation. When Depp sued a U.K. tabloid for libel in 2020, the court ruled against him, finding that 12 of Heard‚Äôs 14 allegations against him were [‚Äúproved to the civil standard](https://archive.is/o/QjY2K/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/02/johnny-depp-trial-how-the-judge-ruled-on-14-alleged-assaults).‚Äù But this isn‚Äôt what happened in the 2022 defamation trial in the U.S. Heard was cast as an opportunist, a slut, a psycho, and a liar, resulting in an outpouring of support for Depp online. (Much of the groundswell of pro-Depp sentiment on social media was later found to be [inorganic](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/who-trolled-amber-heard-alexi-mostrous-podcast-interview); it is perhaps worth noting that Depp‚Äôs crisis PR team during the trial is now working for Baldoni.)

As is the case with the backlash against Lively and Markle, it was mostly women who fueled the campaign against Heard. It was mostly women who were on Etsy selling #JusticeForJohnny decals and coffee mugs; women who spearheaded conspiracy theories about the trial; women making TikToks in blonde wigs, lip-syncing to Heard‚Äôs harrowing account of Depp allegedly raping her with a beer bottle. And when the jury declared Heard guilty of defamation, effectively branding her a liar and ruining her Hollywood career, it was women who came out in droves outside the Virginia courthouse, kissing Depp and congratulating him on his victory. Many onlookers, particularly feminists, struggled to wrap their heads around this and wondered if it was a harbinger of more to come. Now we seem to know the answer.

Why are so many convinced that these women are dishonest ‚Äî and why are they so angry about it? Is it because they simply find them irritating, or are they just that susceptible to social-media smear campaigns? Is it really so hard to believe that misogyny is so deeply ingrained in our culture that even beautiful, wealthy women can suffer from its effects? Maybe they see something in Markle and Lively‚Äôs stories that they don‚Äôt want to see. Maybe it‚Äôs easier to just not look.

It is in the stolen glances across a crowded room, the warmth of a hand intertwined with another, and the quiet comfort of knowing someone is always there.



True love is not found in grand gestures alone but in the little things-the way one person remembers how the other takes their coffee, the way they pull a blanket over them when they fall asleep, or how they listen to their dreams as if they were their own. It is in laughter that echoes through late-night conversations and the unspoken words that rest in the spaces between breaths.



Love is patient, enduring through storms and standing resilient against the winds of change. It is not perfect, but it does not need to be. It thrives in imperfections, in learning, in growing together. It is the courage to be vulnerable, to let someone see the depths of your soul, and to trust that they will cherish it.



Love is not just a moment; it is a lifetime of moments woven

Confused on how to proceed,"Hi everyone. As the title says, I‚Äôve been trying to manifest sleeping through the night. I haven‚Äôt slept through the night since 2017, wake up at least 3-4 times per night, & never feel rested when I wake up. This results in mid day crashes as well. My cortisol is high, and I wake up every night at 3am/3:30am like clockwork.



I‚Äôve been trying to tune into the potential of sleep - but im completely lost. Every night I wake up, cant sleep, and each morning is groggy, exhausting, and I have no energy. How do I tune into the energy of sleep? I wrote it down and came up with how I‚Äôd feel if I slept through the night: energized, at peace, refreshed, rested, happy, love for my body. Im trying to already be those feelings instead, but it‚Äôs not working & I don‚Äôt know where im messing up. I don‚Äôt know what it feels like to be energized and refreshed - I dont remember what that feels like, so it‚Äôs so hard for me to tune into. Even on good days, where I feel like im telling myself that I can sleep through the night, I still wake up numerous times throughout the night & it‚Äôs getting difficult.



Same applies to this situation: I am sensitive to dairy. I used to not be, so im tuning into the potential of having an unlimited diet, eating whatever I want, enjoying/savoring food, feeling joy for life, etc. I am also trying to think FROM the ideal state instead of OF it, but I dont know what to doo. If I could have dairy, I‚Äôd feel unlimited, and order whatever I wanted at coffee shops. But I go with my friend and I always order almond - the other day I had just 2 spoons of ice cream, because I told myself I was healed and fully felt it, but it messed my gut up.

During my senior year, I was juggling tuition payments, textbook expenses, meal plans, and trying to have some kind of social life - all while watching my bank account shrink faster than I could track. None of the finance apps I tried really worked for how students actually manage money (irregular income, shared expenses, etc.).

So I built Finy - a simple finance tracker designed with students in mind:

* **See everything in one place**: Connect accounts from different banks, Venmo, etc.
* **Track subscriptions**: Never forget about that free trial that suddenly starts charging
* **Custom categories**: Label spending by semester, course, or however makes sense to you

The goal was to create something that doesn't make you feel guilty about buying coffee or going out, but helps you understand where your money's actually going so you can make better decisions.

It's available on the App Store if you want to check it out: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finy-navigate-your-finances/id6495369044](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finy-navigate-your-finances/id6495369044)

* What unique financial challenges do you face that most apps don't address?

How do I move forward?,"My (31M) girlfriend (28F) and I have been together for over 6 years and have lived together the entire time (we started as roommates).

We are quite different people. She is extroverted and gets a lot of energy from meeting new people. I am introverted and prefer nights in watching movies. This difference has caused friction in our relationship since almost the beginning.

3 months ago, my GF started a new job and was very excited to meet her new colleagues. They were nice people and they had a lot of fun together at the office. At home after work, we tell each other about our days. With time I get to know most of her colleagues' names through her stories.

I think as time went on, one name kept popping out at me. One of her male colleagues that I will call 'X'. He seemed to always be around. At lunch, for walks after lunch, for playing ping pong during breaks and the two of them always took the same train after work (a 40 minute ride 1 on 1).

One day, my partner says something like ""\*A colleague\* asked me to go to a vintage clothing store together on Saturday"". The choice to say 'a colleague' instead of just using that person's name stood out to me since I know most of her colleagues' names. I did not immediately ask who it was, because I did not want to come off as controlling. A few days later, when the topic came up again, I asked 'Which colleague?'. She replied with the male colleague's name that I had started to worry about. I thought this was weird. Why would they go shopping together?

The day of the 'shopping' comes. Before she goes out the door, I ask one more time what she will be doing. She only mentions the vintage clothing store again and says that they might even go to several. As she left, she grabbed a tote bag that contained an outdoor blanket for sitting on and her camera (not two things that I think to grab when going to a thrift store). She left around 10 in the morning and got back at 6. It turns out he lives an hour away.

When she came back, she said that she noticed that I seemed a little uncomfortable with her going to spend time with this guy (later she would tell me that she noticed that I was uncomfortable before she left that day and even thought about turning her car around to come back home). I told her that I was uncomfortable and I asked her what she did that day. It turns out she drove to his apartment to pick him up, they had some coffee, they went to the clothing store, they then got some food from the supermarket, went on a walk through nature, had a picnic and then went back to his apartment to have another coffee before she came home. At this point it sounds like they had a full on date.

I asked her how she would feel if the roles were reversed. She admitted that she would not feel comfortable with it. We talked about it that evening but did not have any big arguments that I can remember (the last couple of days have been a blur).

That evening, while she was out of the room, I looked at her phone's lock screen (I have never done this and have not done so since) and saw a message from one of her friends asking how her ""DAY WITH 'X'"" went (it was written in all caps). This told me that this was obviously a topic of conversation between her and at least this friend (it came out later that she had asked for advice from several of her friends about whether or not she should hang out with this guy). The 'all caps' nature of the message implied to me that there was some sort of excitement behind the question. If the day was 'normal', why would she have told all of her girlfriends about it?

The next morning, we both wake up early. She tells me first thing in the morning that this guy has provided her with some sort of emotional support and that she and this colleague have a lot in common and she only wanted to see if she and this colleague could be 'just friends'. She assured me that nothing physical happened and I do believe her. This was a bit like a bomb going off for us. We spent all day talking about the situation and our relationship. It was an emotional day for both of us.

The next few days all involve lots of talking about it. At one point, I ask if she has ever deleted any chats. She says yes. She deleted a chat she had with him from her work phone. She says it was because of an inappropriate message he sent her. She sent him a recipe for some sort of chocolate balls and he replied with something along the lines of ""I dip my balls in chocolate"". She claims that there was nothing else inappropriate in that chat.

She also told me at one point that this guy had a girlfriend. In a later conversation, she says that she knows that his relationship with his girlfriend will probably not last.

We also talked about what is appropriate in a relationship. I am of the mind that if you are in a committed relationship you do everything you can do protect that relationship (ie: do not spend time outside of work with someone who you might have some sort of relationship with). She seems to be of the mind that sometimes you can't control how you feel and have to take some time to find out what is going on (she might object to my wording here, but the idea to me seems to be that she thinks sometimes it is alright to wait and see instead of killing it before it grows into anything).

She has expressed regret for 'risking' our relationship and now claims that there are no romantic feelings for the guy but still struggles with what would be 'appropriate' for her to do with him (whether or not they should keep in touch). Now both of us are reevaluating our relationship to see if we want to continue. I think she wonders if someone more similar to her would be a better fit. I do not know what I want to do. I think I still love her. I am familiar with the idea of 'sunken costs' but I can't help but think about all of the great times/adventures we have had together. If we break up, my life will change quite dramatically (I will quit my job and move back to my home country... which are two things I have thought about doing in the past \*with\* my partner). My undecidedness probably means that I am willing to try to fix things if she is. I can definitely see some places in our relationship where I was not doing all that I could for our relationship and may not have always seemed open to the conversations that she wanted to have so by no means do I pretend to be the 'perfect' BF, but I am definitely not the devil.

How do I move forward with this?  Is there anything I should ask her?  Is this 'overcomable'?

TL;DR: My GF of 6 years started getting close to a male colleague at work. She had doubts about what their relationship was and asked her friends for advice. She then accepted an invite to hang out with him outside of work. I think she 'trickle truthed' me a bit throughout the whole thing (hiding details until I asked for them). Now our relationship has blown up and I am wondering what to do next.",62,1743187076.0,relationship_advice,93,0.89,False

I've been trying to remember this show for a while now and I feel like I can't find it anywhere.

So basically, I am Canadian fwi if this helps, but it was a show about basically this like band who would hang out a lot at I think some kind of coffee shop or something? They were part of some kind of second life-looking virtual reality competition where they had avatars and would perform on this online portal.

I can't remember anything else other than in one episode some character (I think their manager maybe?) wants to be sung the song ""my bonnie lies over the moon"" while he's laying on a couch in the coffee shop place. I think it's bc someone lost a bet to him and had to do what he asked or something? 

Anyways hope this was enough, seems like a really niche kind of TV show so hopefully someone remembers it.",1,1743187039.0,tipofmytongue,4,1.0,False

Whole album review- 7,4 the album felt very heavy and that kinda messed me up after Model because that was such a light album like a nice salad and More was like tartare (idk why i used food as reference) but its also cause im a teenager so i dig nothing happens and TMTIO more cause its like adolescence.

1. Deep dive - reprise (idk this is my nr. 1 for now until i have listen to the others songs a little more. But its a very light and happy song or how it sounds, and feels hopefull and playfull. Also the bridge is so nice and i also think this song will be a great summer song.)

2. Not Alone (I really liked the ending or the last minute when Dylan sang it reminded me a lot of nothing happens and that i really enjoyed, tho the start felt a little empty, because it was very repetitive. but that also did so the last moment of the song was more enjoyable.)

3. Learn to love again (Did not see the chorus happen at all but i loved it, it wasn't like angry or scratchy like coffee change, and it felt more light reminding me of TMTIO.)

4. Deep dive (It is very close to reprise and that confused me but i know its also the same song just kinda reimagined, but its nice.)

5. Your new favorite song (This is very intresting and i really like the way they explored diffrent musical instruments in this song, also loved Dylan just out in a forrest with uggs on. But i did wish Dylans voice was more clear like in deep dive - reprise.)

6. coffee change (I read that someone said the song was about lvining for money and then dying and i really like that meaning, tho as hide it away its a little bit to much rock for me and i also dont like the crusty dusty sound on it.)

  
7. hide it away (One song has to be last, its just not my style. i dont really like the rock in the song, and i also feel like the chorus is too early. The lyrics sounded sad, but the song sounded angry, and it felt weird in that way when those two feelings got mixed up.)

Here are some notes on some companies that I have been giving most of my attention to as of lately. I have been talking about HASH for what feels like months now. I was a bit late to the party with HBFG but still think it looks great. Kept the mining companies to a minimum but had to throw in HUNT because they should be pretty active in the coming months.¬†

As always, please feel free to comment any tickers you would like me to check out! I have actually found a ton of solid picks from the comments. Cheers

**Happy Belly Food Group $HBFG.CN / $HBFGF**

Market Cap: 152M

This has become one of my favourite small cap companies. The stock had a strong run last year and has been holding above a buck canadian while the company just keeps moving forward. It is basically even on the year so far, but if you‚Äôve been tracking the fundamentals, they‚Äôre clearly getting stronger.

Happy Belly is focused on building and scaling early-stage food brands across Canada. Most of their growth is through franchising, which means they don‚Äôt have to shell out massive capital to open new stores. Their model is built around franchise fees, royalties, and strong real estate partnerships. That setup gives them leverage without having to burn cash.

They just opened their 50th store and keep signing new multi-unit deals. Rosie's Burgers just secured five more locations in BC, and Heal Wellness continues to grow as one of the strongest smoothie bowl concepts in the country.

This isn‚Äôt just a pure restaurant play either. They‚Äôve started to build out the CPG side with things like Smile Tiger Coffee and Lumber Heads Popcorn, which is already in Loblaws. That gives them a way to build consumer brand awareness beyond their stores and creates another stream of potential growth.

The pipeline matters here. They now have over¬†**500**¬†franchise locations signed across their portfolio, including those in development and under construction. If even a fraction of those turn into operating stores, it should have a serious impact on revenue.

The guy behind all of this is Sean Black. He helped build and scale Extreme Pita and Mucho Burrito, which were eventually sold to MTY. So this isn‚Äôt his first time building a brand from the ground up. What‚Äôs different now is that he‚Äôs applying all that experience with more structure and a lot more discipline. He‚Äôs also been active and visible throughout the growth of Happy Belly, and it‚Äôs been clear he‚Äôs focused on long-term execution, not quick wins. He is super active on socials and even has a discord channel where he is always answering questions.

The company is still small, and they‚Äôre not generating big profits yet, but they‚Äôre raising capital at a premium and running lean. No bloated debt. They‚Äôve been doing things the right way so far IMO.

I like this one because it doesn‚Äôt need to 10x overnight to make sense. The upside comes from slow, steady execution. If they keep doing what they‚Äôve been doing, I think it could double or triple over the next couple of years just from the business catching up to the story. Looking forward to the fins over the next few quarters

Still early, but worth watching closely. FYI, I am canadian and Rosie's burgers is incredible.

**Simply Solventless Concentrates $HASH.V $SSLCF**

Market Cap: 71M

If you‚Äôve given up on the cannabis sector, you‚Äôre not alone lol. Most of the names are still bleeding and the market sentiment is brutal. But HASH is quietly putting together one of the more interesting setups I‚Äôve seen in a while.

They‚Äôre taking advantage of how beaten down the industry is and making smart acquisitions at low multiples. Instead of launching new brands or dumping money into marketing, they‚Äôre consolidating. And they‚Äôre doing it in categories that actually generate decent margins, like concentrates, vapes, and prerolls.

In January, they acquired CanadaBis and its operating brand Stigma Grow in an all-share deal. Stigma brings in 2.7M in ebitda on its own and is expected to hit 7M after synergies are factored in. They also picked up around 10 to 15M in real estate value, product listings, and working capital. They basically paid 15.9M in stock and received 24.9M in asset value, making the actual multiple closer to 2.3x ebitda. That‚Äôs rare in this sector.

Then in March, HASH closed the acquisition of Delta 9 Bio-Tech, which is being rebranded as Humble Grow Co. That deal added 12M in annual revenue and 2.5M in adjusted ebitda. Again, no big cash outlay. It was structured to be zero cash upfront, net of working capital.

With just these two moves, HASH is projecting up to 26M in combined ebitda and over 100M in annualized revenue by late 2025. Their updated projections for Q4 2025 are around 24.6M in normalized net income and 22M in working capital.¬†

And it is probably worth mentioning that they‚Äôre not buying questionable assets or distressed licenses. Both of these operators were already cash flow positive. Stigma had 12 consecutive quarters of positive ebitda before being acquired.

This isn‚Äôt a momentum trade, but if they keep executing and hit anywhere near the numbers they‚Äôre projecting, it‚Äôs probably one of the best risk-reward setups left in cannabis. No one‚Äôs paying attention yet, but that could change fast once the market starts to price in actual profitability.

The next few quarters are going to matter a lot. If the numbers start lining up with what they‚Äôve laid out, this could get re-rated quickly. Definitely one to keep an eye on! I think my average cost is around .58ish!¬†

Also wouldn't be surprised to see some major cannabis company try to acquire ssc!

**Gold Hunter Resources $HUNT $HNTRF**

Market Cap: $7M

This is a super early-stage explorer, so definitely on the speculative side, but the setup is pretty compelling. With gold and commodities running this hard, the cash usually flows into juniors near the end of the cycle (which is why I have been discussing mining companies so much as of lately)

Gold Hunter has pulled together a big piece of land in Newfoundland that sits on top of a major fault line. That fault line is important because these types of structures are where gold deposits often form. The ground has been worked before, but mostly in bits and pieces by different groups over the years. Gold Hunter is the first to put it all under one roof and start looking at it as a bigger system.

The company now controls nearly 50 kilometers of strike length, which is a huge footprint for a junior. They‚Äôve already identified a bunch of gold-bearing zones, including one area that returned a standout drill result of 27 meters at nearly 8 grams per tonne. That is pretty solid.

They‚Äôve also gone back and digitized a pile of historical data, including 60,000 meters of drilling that had never really been connected before. That gave them a much clearer picture of the potential. Now the next big step is the VTEM survey, which is a geophysical scan of the entire property. That data will help them decide where to drill next. It hasn‚Äôt started yet, but should be coming very soon, and it‚Äôs the main thing I‚Äôm watching for.

Drilling is expected to kick off in Q2. They‚Äôve already said it‚Äôll be a 15 to 20 thousand meter program, which is a lot for a company this size. The goal isn‚Äôt just to confirm old hits, but to test the bigger structural model and see if this has the scale to become a multi-zone discovery.

The team behind it has real experience. They‚Äôve been involved in takeouts, big discoveries, and recently returned a six times gain to shareholders on a previous deal. And Eric Sprott keeps backing them, which is never a bad sign.

This one‚Äôs still like completely under the radar. No drilling yet, no big hype, and still a tiny market cap. But if the data lines up and they start hitting, it won‚Äôt stay this quiet for long. Looking forward to seeing what the next couple months bring. Just understand that this is by far the most speculative company in this post but I usually like to discuss companies of different sizes and risk levels.

I was a bit late to the party with HBFG but still think it looks great. Kept the mining companies to a minimum but had to throw in HUNT because they should be pretty active in the coming months.¬†

As always, please feel free to comment any tickers you would like me to check out! I have actually found a ton of solid picks from the comments. Cheers

  


**Happy Belly Food Group $HBFG.CN / $HBFGF**

Market Cap: 152M

This has become one of my favourite small cap companies. The stock had a strong run last year and has been holding above a buck canadian while the company just keeps moving forward. It is basically even on the year so far, but if you‚Äôve been tracking the fundamentals, they‚Äôre clearly getting stronger.

Happy Belly is focused on building and scaling early-stage food brands across Canada. Most of their growth is through franchising, which means they don‚Äôt have to shell out massive capital to open new stores. Their model is built around franchise fees, royalties, and strong real estate partnerships. That setup gives them leverage without having to burn cash.

They just opened their 50th store and keep signing new multi-unit deals. Rosie's Burgers just secured five more locations in BC, and Heal Wellness continues to grow as one of the strongest smoothie bowl concepts in the country.

This isn‚Äôt just a pure restaurant play either. They‚Äôve started to build out the CPG side with things like Smile Tiger Coffee and Lumber Heads Popcorn, which is already in Loblaws. That gives them a way to build consumer brand awareness beyond their stores and creates another stream of potential growth.

The pipeline matters here. They now have over **500** franchise locations signed across their portfolio, including those in development and under construction. If even a fraction of those turn into operating stores, it should have a serious impact on revenue.

The guy behind all of this is Sean Black. He helped build and scale Extreme Pita and Mucho Burrito, which were eventually sold to MTY. So this isn‚Äôt his first time building a brand from the ground up. What‚Äôs different now is that he‚Äôs applying all that experience with more structure and a lot more discipline. He‚Äôs also been active and visible throughout the growth of Happy Belly, and it‚Äôs been clear he‚Äôs focused on long-term execution, not quick wins. He is super active on socials and even has a discord channel where he is always answering questions.

The company is still small, and they‚Äôre not generating big profits yet, but they‚Äôre raising capital at a premium and running lean. No bloated debt. They‚Äôve been doing things the right way so far IMO.

I like this one because it doesn‚Äôt need to 10x overnight to make sense. The upside comes from slow, steady execution. If they keep doing what they‚Äôve been doing, I think it could double or triple over the next couple of years just from the business catching up to the story. Looking forward to the fins over the next few quarters

Still early, but worth watching closely. FYI, I am canadian and Rosie's burgers is incredible.



**Simply Solventless Concentrates $HASH.V $SSLCF**

Market Cap: 71M

If you‚Äôve given up on the cannabis sector, you‚Äôre not alone lol. Most of the names are still bleeding and the market sentiment is brutal. But HASH is quietly putting together one of the more interesting setups I‚Äôve seen in a while.

They‚Äôre taking advantage of how beaten down the industry is and making smart acquisitions at low multiples. Instead of launching new brands or dumping money into marketing, they‚Äôre consolidating. And they‚Äôre doing it in categories that actually generate decent margins, like concentrates, vapes, and prerolls.

In January, they acquired CanadaBis and its operating brand Stigma Grow in an all-share deal. Stigma brings in 2.7M in ebitda on its own and is expected to hit 7M after synergies are factored in. They also picked up around 10 to 15M in real estate value, product listings, and working capital. They basically paid 15.9M in stock and received 24.9M in asset value, making the actual multiple closer to 2.3x ebitda. That‚Äôs rare in this sector.

Then in March, HASH closed the acquisition of Delta 9 Bio-Tech, which is being rebranded as Humble Grow Co. That deal added 12M in annual revenue and 2.5M in adjusted ebitda. Again, no big cash outlay. It was structured to be zero cash upfront, net of working capital.

With just these two moves, HASH is projecting up to 26M in combined ebitda and over 100M in annualized revenue by late 2025. Their updated projections for Q4 2025 are around 24.6M in normalized net income and 22M in working capital.¬†

And it is probably worth mentioning that they‚Äôre not buying questionable assets or distressed licenses. Both of these operators were already cash flow positive. Stigma had 12 consecutive quarters of positive ebitda before being acquired.

This isn‚Äôt a momentum trade, but if they keep executing and hit anywhere near the numbers they‚Äôre projecting, it‚Äôs probably one of the best risk-reward setups left in cannabis. No one‚Äôs paying attention yet, but that could change fast once the market starts to price in actual profitability.

The next few quarters are going to matter a lot. If the numbers start lining up with what they‚Äôve laid out, this could get re-rated quickly. Definitely one to keep an eye on! I think my average cost is around .58ish!¬†

Also wouldn't be surprised to see some major cannabis company try to acquire ssc!

**Gold Hunter Resources $HUNT $HNTRF**

Market Cap: $7M

This is a super early-stage explorer, so definitely on the speculative side, but the setup is pretty compelling. With gold and commodities running this hard, the cash usually flows into juniors near the end of the cycle (which is why I have been discussing mining companies so much as of lately)

Gold Hunter has pulled together a big piece of land in Newfoundland that sits on top of a major fault line. That fault line is important because these types of structures are where gold deposits often form. The ground has been worked before, but mostly in bits and pieces by different groups over the years. Gold Hunter is the first to put it all under one roof and start looking at it as a bigger system.

The company now controls nearly 50 kilometers of strike length, which is a huge footprint for a junior. They‚Äôve already identified a bunch of gold-bearing zones, including one area that returned a standout drill result of 27 meters at nearly 8 grams per tonne. That is pretty solid.

They‚Äôve also gone back and digitized a pile of historical data, including 60,000 meters of drilling that had never really been connected before. That gave them a much clearer picture of the potential. Now the next big step is the VTEM survey, which is a geophysical scan of the entire property. That data will help them decide where to drill next. It hasn‚Äôt started yet, but should be coming very soon, and it‚Äôs the main thing I‚Äôm watching for.

Drilling is expected to kick off in Q2. They‚Äôve already said it‚Äôll be a 15 to 20 thousand meter program, which is a lot for a company this size. The goal isn‚Äôt just to confirm old hits, but to test the bigger structural model and see if this has the scale to become a multi-zone discovery.

The team behind it has real experience. They‚Äôve been involved in takeouts, big discoveries, and recently returned a six times gain to shareholders on a previous deal. And Eric Sprott keeps backing them, which is never a bad sign.

This one‚Äôs still like completely under the radar. No drilling yet, no big hype, and still a tiny market cap. But if the data lines up and they start hitting, it won‚Äôt stay this quiet for long. Looking forward to seeing what the next couple months bring. Just understand that this is by far the most speculative company in this post but I usually like to discuss companies of different sizes and risk levels.

A problem I have put off tackling for a really really long time is theme support in my projects. I end up starting just hardcoding colors and then after the project is mature I am just too lazy to go back and add theme support because I'd have to touch every single component file in the codebase.

If you don't know already, your project should have a `globals.css` file with some code that looks like this:

    }

I ended up writing this Cursor rule which has helped me:

1. quickly refactor large codebases to use themes properly (just tell Cursor to use the variables in globals.css instead of hardcoded colors to all files ending in `.tsx` and it'll do a search then start applying, may take a while)
2. automatically use the color variables when creating new code



    # Use Color Theme
    
    Whenever building components, unless otherwise specified, always use the colors available in globals.css instead of hardcoding color values in the component.

I auto attach this rule to all files ending in `.tsx` in my codebase

And now, my sites looks well themed (not perfect, but better than I could do without AI) and they come built in with light+dark mode support.

Whenever I start a new project, I now prompt Cursor (or ChatGPT or whatever) with ""Please update the globals.css file to use a color scheme based on #xxxxxx"" and it is really good at updating all of the light+dark variables to go along with that color. This has been a **game changer** for my personal boilerplate that I use for every project.

* [Drinking coffee](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/luke-coutinhos-morning-tip-skip-coffee-and-start-with-water/) on an empty stomach can cause hormonal imbalances and anxiety.
* Hydrating and consuming fats, proteins, and fruits first is recommended.
* Excess caffeine intake may lead to restlessness and digestive issues.

Coffee is a morning staple for many, but consuming it first thing without [food](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/guava-and-its-leaves-a-daily-superfood-for-better-health/) might not be the best idea. According to fitness expert Luke Coutinho, this habit can spike cortisol levels, leading to anxiety, mood swings, and hormonal imbalances.

Coutinho emphasizes that coffee, when consumed in [moderation](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/are-you-eating-too-much-protein-experts-set-the-record-straight/) and without excessive additives, can be beneficial. However, people should be aware of caffeine dependency and potential side effects like restlessness or nausea.

**Why You Should Reconsider Drinking Coffee on an Empty Stomach**

Caffeine is known for its energy-boosting properties, but consuming it on an [empty stomach ](https://worldmagzine.com/americas/hochul-proposes-free-school-meals-for-all-new-york-students/)can do more harm than good. It triggers cortisol imbalances, which can heighten stress and anxiety levels, making mornings more challenging rather than energizing.

Luke Coutinho stresses the importance of a well-balanced morning routine. Drinking water first, followed by healthy fats, proteins, and fruits, helps regulate digestion and stabilizes blood sugar before introducing caffeine. This shift can promote better overall health and mental clarity.

For those who struggle with digestion and rely on coffee for bowel movements, Coutinho suggests evaluating their [nutrition](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/the-essential-role-of-nutrition-in-womens-health-during-national-nutrition-week/) and stress levels. Magnesium deficiency, in particular, can contribute to digestive issues, and addressing it may reduce dependence on coffee for this purpose.

Furthermore, while coffee has health benefits, overconsumption can lead to side effects such as nausea, jitteriness, and even digestive distress. Keeping coffee intake moderate and prioritizing high-quality black coffee can help mitigate these risks while still enjoying its perks.

A mindful approach to coffee consumption can help prevent [hormonal imbalances](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/clear-skin-starts-from-within-4-lifestyle-changes-to-prevent-acne/) and digestive issues. Prioritizing hydration and nutrition before caffeine ensures better health and long-term well-being.

My eyes, a striking blue, were my defining feature‚Äîpeople said they sparkled like the ocean on a summer day. At twenty-eight, my life matched their brilliance: a cozy apartment in Portland, a job as a graphic designer that paid well enough, and a girlfriend, Mia, who laughed at my terrible puns. I noticed the way sunlight danced through leaves, how rain painted the city in streaks of silver. Life was beautiful, and I saw it all.

Until I didn‚Äôt...

The accident happened on a Tuesday night, just after 10 p.m. I was driving home from a late client meeting, the road slick with autumn rain. A truck veered into my lane‚Äîheadlights blinding, tires screeching‚Äîand the world exploded into chaos. Glass shattered, metal crumpled, and my head slammed against the steering wheel. When I woke up in the hospital three days later, the world was gone. My eyes were gone. The doctors told me the damage was irreparable: shards of windshield had severed the optic nerves. I‚Äôd never see again.

At first, the darkness was suffocating. Mia stayed by my side, her voice trembling as she described the sterile white walls of the hospital room I‚Äôd never see. My hands shook as I traced the bandages wrapped around my head, feeling the void where my eyes once were. The nurses whispered about my recovery, but I barely heard them. I was drowning in the black, mourning the colors I‚Äôd lost forever.

Then, on the fifth night, something changed.

I was lying awake, the beep of the heart monitor a steady rhythm, when a faint glow pierced the darkness. It wasn‚Äôt light‚Äînot the kind I remembered. It was a silhouette, shimmering and indistinct, hovering near the foot of my bed. My breath caught in my throat. The shape was human, but it pulsed with a deep, angry red, like blood glowing under a spotlight. I blinked‚Äîor tried to, though the reflex was useless now‚Äîand the figure vanished.

The next morning, the hospital buzzed with grim news. Three patients had died overnight: an elderly woman in Room 312, a teenager with leukemia two doors down, and a man recovering from surgery across the hall. I overheard the nurses murmuring about ‚Äúunexpected complications‚Äù and ‚Äúbad luck.‚Äù My stomach twisted. I didn‚Äôt know how, but I knew that red silhouette had something to do with it.

Days passed, and the silhouettes kept coming. Not all of them were red. Some glowed a soft, neutral hue‚Äîpale blues and greens, like watercolor stains against the black canvas of my mind. They weren‚Äôt vague hallucinations; they were people, or something tied to them. I could sense their presence, their outlines sharp in a way my ruined eyes could never have managed. One day, I asked Mia to describe the orderly who brought my lunch. ‚ÄúTall, skinny, brown hair,‚Äù she said. I nodded‚ÄîI‚Äôd ‚Äúseen‚Äù the man‚Äôs soul, a steady green flicker, just minutes before.

It hit me then: I wasn‚Äôt blind, not entirely. My sight had shifted, rewired. Where my eyes once caught light, my mind now glimpsed something deeper. Souls, I decided to call them. I didn‚Äôt need a visual cortex to process them; they burned straight into my consciousness, raw and unfiltered. The normal souls‚Äîgreen, blue, gold‚Äîbelonged to the living, the healthy. The red ones? They were harbingers. Every time I saw that crimson glow, someone died within hours.

When I was discharged a month later, I kept my new ability secret. Mia drove me home, her voice bright with forced optimism, but I barely responded. I was too busy watching the souls drifting past the car window‚Äîfaint glimmers in the void. A blue soul in a pedestrian crossing the street. A green one in the driver of a pickup truck. And then, a red silhouette in the backseat of a taxi. I didn‚Äôt turn my head‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt‚Äîbut I heard the distant wail of sirens minutes later. Another death. Another confirmation.

Months slipped by, and I adapted. I learned to navigate my apartment by memory and sound, though the souls guided me too, their glow a strange compass in the dark. Mia stayed, patient through my silences, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell her what I saw. How could I explain the dread that gripped me every time a red soul flared into view? I witnessed them everywhere: at the grocery store, on walks in the park, even in the coffee shop where Mia read me the newspaper. Each red silhouette was a clock ticking down‚Äîcar accidents, heart attacks, a fall down the stairs. I couldn‚Äôt stop them. I could only watch.

One crisp April morning, seven months after the accident, I stood in my bathroom, splashing water on my face. The routine grounded me, a tether to the life I‚Äôd once had. I reached for a towel, then froze. A red soul flickered into existence‚Äînot across the room, not down the hall, but right in front of me. My breath hitched. I turned my head instinctively, though it made no difference, and the silhouette stayed locked in place. It was my reflection. My own soul, burning red in the mirror.

Panic clawed at my chest. I stumbled back, knocking over a bottle of soap, and called for Mia. She rushed in, her voice tight with worry. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Ethan, talk to me!‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt explain‚Äînot fully‚Äîbut I grabbed her arm and rasped, ‚ÄúI need a doctor. Now.‚Äù

At the hospital, the tests were a blur. Bloodwork, scans, an EKG. I sat rigid, the red glow of my soul pulsing in my mind, brighter than ever. The doctor returned with a frown. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you came in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe found a clot in your lung‚Äîa pulmonary embolism. Another few hours, and‚Ä¶‚Äù He didn‚Äôt finish. He didn‚Äôt need to. My hands trembled as they hooked me to an IV, pumping me full of anticoagulants. The red faded from my vision by nightfall, replaced by the familiar green of my living soul.

I‚Äôd cheated it. For the first time, the red hadn‚Äôt won.

After that, I started paying closer attention. I couldn‚Äôt predict the deaths‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt warn anyone‚Äîbut I could save myself. The red souls still appeared, still claimed their victims, but I refused to let them take me. Life settled into a strange rhythm: Mia‚Äôs laughter, the hum of the city, and the ever-present dance of souls in the dark.

Then, a year after the accident, something shifted again.

It started with my neighbor, Mrs. Delaney, a widow who lived downstairs. I had seen her soul before‚Äîa steady gold, warm and constant. But one evening, as I passed her door, I saw something new: a red silhouette, faint and wispy, drifting toward her. It didn‚Äôt hover like the others. It merged. The red sank into her gold soul, staining it like ink in water, and then it was gone.

The next day, Mrs. Delaney collapsed in the hallway. Not dead‚Äîunconscious. A stroke, the paramedics said as they wheeled her away. My gut twisted. She hadn‚Äôt died, but the red had touched her. Two weeks later, it happened again: a green soul in the park, a red wisp slipping inside. Hours later, a scream‚Äîsomeone had found the man seizing on a bench. A brain aneurysm, fatal this time.

The red souls weren‚Äôt just death omens anymore. They were something else‚Äîsomething active. They didn‚Äôt only mark the dying; they infected the living. And the more I saw, the more I wondered: were they souls at all? Or were they something darker‚Äîhunters, reapers, parasites feeding on life itself?

One night, alone in my apartment, I stood before the mirror again. My soul glowed green, steady as ever. But as I stared, a faint red shimmer appeared‚Äînot within me, but behind me. It drifted closer, its edges curling like smoke. My breath stopped. The red wisp hovered, then turned, gliding toward the bedroom where Mia slept.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, lunging blindly.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop it.",7,1743186585.0,nosleep,3,0.89,False

1jm1yep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jm1yep/feeling_disconnected_37m_trouble_communicating/,"Feeling Disconnected (37M), trouble communicating with wife (34F)","This is my first post of this nature ever. I follow this sub and occasionally comment but have never sought advice like this. But I feel like my marriage is in trouble and I have no one else to discuss this with. My wife (34F) and I (37M) been together for 11 years, married for 10. We have 2 kids together plus her son/daughter from a previous relationship who both live with us full time so i.e. we have 4 kids, ages 15, 13, 9, and 7. 

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety on/off for a few years. I have good months and bad months, but when its bad its really bad; jolted awake in the middle of the night with intense anxiety like a buzzing feeling all over my face and torso. I've struggled with ED on/off ever since I got a vasectomy (6 yrs ago) which may or may not be related. My wife had an affair which started just a few months after my vasectomy and my ED problem. It got so serious we actually separated while she attempted to make things happen with this new guy (10 yrs younger than her, 13 yrs younger than me)...obviously a huge blow to my confidence. It didn't work out for her so we got back together which itself was probably a mistake for me. She hasn't been consistently faithful since we got back together. She hasn't admitted to another affair but I've caught her going to see this same guy from affair multiple times, texting & snapchatting him, etc, lying saying she's going to a friends when I can see on her apple location she actually went to the bar where the kid works. For about a year (up until Dec2024) things had gotten so much better, no funny business from her, starting to feel really connected again, zero problems with ED for me. Then in December I found out through a drunken admission from her friend that this ex-dude of hers now works at this new bar that just opened and she's been going there to see him. The whole thing blew up into a huge argument - her making me feel like I'm being crazy/controlling by expecting her to not go the bar where he works. I say: out of respect for me and our relationship you should not be going to the place where this dude works, even though she says ""that's not why I go there, my friends and I just like that bar"".. Our arguments rarely get resolved and typically just end in both of us giving the silent treatment, and the next morning she'll typically be extra affectionate and apologetic for ""being mean"" but not actually discussing the issues or making any kind of promises to be better. At this point I am feeling extremely discontent and disconnected from this relationship, desperately wanting out. For nearly 2 months I would wake up every morning with such intense resentment for her but I bottle it up because she hates communicating. Multiple times throughout Dec/Jan/Feb I can see on her apple location that she's at his bar and when she gets home she just lies saying she was working late or some other excuse (she's also a bartender who usually gets off work around 9pm but occasionally work does keep her until 10 or so). The only time in five years where we've ever had a serious discussion about ANY issue plaguing our relationship (kids, sex, anything) is when she is really drunk. And her outlook obviously isn't the best in that state. ED problems back really bad. I've tried to take men's health supplements to combat this, even sometimes taking ED meds which have helped in the past but what's really scaring me now is for the past few months even those don't work. The only time we've been able to have sex for the past 3 months is when I'm drunk, which I would imagine is because its suppressing my stress/anxiety.

Anyway cut to now (early March2025) and it's like overnight she snapped herself out of it and has been like an angel to me. She doesn't go out drinking after work at night (at all, let alone to ex-dude's work) and she's been clearly making an effort to be nicer to me around the house. She has even been the one initiating sex semi-regularly (once a week or so) which she normally never does. My problem is I still feel this same disconnect. I feel like I have no soul when I'm around her. I try to do nice things to revive my love such as bring her flowers & coffee the other day, but while I'm doing I feel like a complete sucker/loser like why would any dumbass spoil this women who's treated me like she has? Even though I honestly  have been the one being spoiled for the past month. But still I wake up every morning desperately wanting out of this relationship, though that itself is not easy as we're raising four kids and have a huge mortgage payment on our house, and while I could definitely survive financially on my own - she definitely could NOT.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is how can I start up my feelings for her again? When we first got back together after her trial/affair/separation (only lasted 3 months) it was fairly easy for me to fall in love with her again because I missed her so much and was devastated by the break-up. But now even though for at least 4 weeks she has done nothing wrong and been nicer to me than she has in 5-ish years. I still find her insanely attractive, she's the hottest woman in the world in my eyes. This morning she initiated sex (in a very sexy manner that any man would be thanking god for such a moment) and as soon as we get naked in bed together my erection dies. Extremely frustrating for both of us but she's typically pretty patient with that (taking a step back, slowing it down) because we've struggled with it on/off for a few years now. But this time it just wasn't working at all, even after taking my ED meds earlier that morning. I'm so afraid to bring up the real issue of how I feel completely disconnected from her emotionally because she stonewalls and gets REALLY mad whenever I try to talk about my feelings or even worse when I try to get her to talk about hers.

I get a lot of ""but it's 2025!"" type comments from incredulous people when they discover that I don't use any of the following:   
\- Uber/Lyft  
\- Streaming subscriptions like Paramount etc  
\- Spotify etc  
\- AirBNB  
\- Amazon/AliBaba etc  
\- Ticketmaster etc  
\- Fast fashion like Shein

I get that many people have adopted the mindset of ""my subscription fee is a drop in the bucket, and XYZ thing is convenient and everyone else does it anyway, so I'm just gonna keep buying it because it makes no difference"" - while I disagree that 'everyone else does it' is adequate justification for participating in a harmful/wasteful process, that's admittedly understandable when the decision is whether to pay a small fee for a convenience that basically everyone else also pays for.  
What doesn't make sense to me is how everyone seems to have forgotten that so much of our modern tech-based conveniences already have analogue equivalents and/or are fairly new and were never necessary prior to their creation (I'm talking like Spotify...people are like ""so you don't listen to music??"" and I'm like...no...what? Same with Uber and AirBNB...like girl, taxis and hotels exist and are way better anyway, not to mention less harmful to their respective economic ecosystems).

This is what we did and it was \*almost\* perfect! I wish I would have kept our actual itinerary, but this is pretty close.  I saved most places that we wanted to see on google maps beforehand, and kind of just planned it from there.

2 adults (40s), 1 child (9), 2 seniors (70s) 

4 pieces of medium luggage and 2 backpacks 

Jan 23 - Feb 3

23 Jan - flight from LAX - HND arrived by 1615 on 24 Jan, got through customs in 20 minutes, bathroom breaks, picked up our Ninja wifi, got SUCA cards (for those that didn't have iPhone), took the train to the shinkansen station.  We did not make prior reservations, but booked online right before we got on.  We didn't want to book too late or too early - so we used their app, and were able to book the 1600 Nozomi to Shin-Osaka, with luggage seats.  Had a nice and easy trip to Osaka, transferred to our station, no problems, walked to hotel.  

24-28 - Arrived to hotel by 2130, check-in was seamless.  We stayed at the Hotel K6 Osaka Namba, and I cannot recommend this hotel enough!!  It had the perfect location, amazing staff, and incredible amenities...free self-serve unlimited alcohol, soda and coffee, plus nightly noodles and 24 hour snacks? Yes please!!  The rooms were huge for Japan and the location was simply fantastic!!  A block away from Dontonbori, several subway stops and convenience stores, and TONS of food!  It was perfect for us. We walked to the Family Mart for some chicken and snacks, walked for a bit, and then went to bed.

25 - woke up early, had included breakfast at hotel, walked through the city, saw Dontonbori, of course Don Quijote, took a river cruise, hidden temples, shopping, lunch, etc.  Went back to the hotel for a little break, went out for a nice dinner later, sent the parents and kid back to the hotel and did some bar hopping/street drinking.

26 - got up early again and took the shinkansen to Hiroshima  (we ended up getting the Kansai-Hiroshima pass, which we picked up our first day there).  Spent the day walking through the memorial park and got a nice lunch at a local place for okonomiyaki.  Walked the water front for a while, but ultimately decided not to go to Miyajima, due to time restraints.  It was a nice day, and we're very happy that we did it.  Got back to Osaka around 6, went for dinner, we all walked around the city that night and let the kiddo play a bunch of the vending machines.  After we sent the kiddo and parents to the hotel, we decided to go to the castle, and happened upon a fun lights festival there.  It was beautiful and a lot of fun!!  Back to town for a few more drinks a late night massage and then bedtime.

27 -  early rise again, went to Kyoto.  This was my second time in Kyoto, and I don't know if it was the day, or what, but the crowds were overwhelming!  We did a few of the ""big"" spots and left, because it just wasn't our vibe.  That's a personal thing for everyone, so I would never suggest skipping Kyoto if it's something that you want to see.  For me, it just wasn't what it used to be.  Decided to send the parents back to relax and took our kiddo to Universal for the rest of the day.  We got 1/2 price tickets for late entry and had a blast!!  I'm actually upset we didn't spend more time there, because it was so much fun!  Again, not everyone's cup of tea, but we loved it.  We stayed until closing and then met my folks for a late dinner and walked around a bit longer.  

28 - slept in, ate breakfast, and took everyone else to the castle for a bit.  Got back and transferred to Shin-Osaka to catch our Shinkansen to Tokyo.  Arrived in Tokyo around 1500ish, checked in to our hotel (Oriental Hotel Tokyo Bay), across from Disney, had the free lobby drinks and snacks, and went to the shopping center adjacent for dinner.  It was fabulous! Steaks served on an iron skillet, fried rice, gyoza and beers - all from the food court, and all delicious!!  Around $60 for all 5 of us, and we ordered WAY too much! lol Off to bed for an early start at Disney Land.  

29 - early start, had breakfast included with our stay and took the shuttle to Disney.  We were able to get there before the gates opened and had a wonderful day!  I downloaded their app, brought the wifi and a battery.  There's way too much info for Disney, so I suggest looking at subs just for that.  We do not regret doing it, at all.  It's a totally different vibe from US or Paris Disney, plus SOO cheap!!  We got back early enough to have dinner at the food court again and went to bed.

30 - early start for the kiddo and I - grabbed a quick breakfast at the family mart located in the lobby and hopped on the shuttle for Disney Sea.  The hubs and parents slept in and walked around.  We left by 1630 and hopped on the train to Akasaka.  Checked into our hotel, Mystay Premier Akasaka, dropped off luggage and hit the town.  We chose to stay around the hotel that night and had a fabulous dinner at a local ramen shop, walked around the streets, took in the sights and went back for bed.  

31 - got up around 9, had breakfast at hotel and hopped on a train to the fish market.  Walked around and ate A LOT, enjoyed the sights, and then on to the Asahi Sky Tower for some nice views and some drinks.  From there we went to Senso-Ji Temple and did all of the touristy stuff, and then just walked around and found some dinner. The parents and kiddo went back to the hotel and hubs and I went into Shinjuku for some drinks and people watching, then late night revolver sushi. lol

1 - woke up, hotel breakfast and headed to Shibuya.  Did the cross walk, walked a lot of the streets, had some chicken and beers, Don Quijote, headed to the Gyoen park and saw ""Godzilla"".  Found a nice place for a Kobe steak dinner, dropped off the parents and kiddo, rinse, repeat.

2 - Final day - we decided to take it easy, sleep in, get more chicken, because we had to, hahaha. Walked around just taking in the sights, and ended up finding a fun little Harry Potter area right by our hotel.  We did the cafe, let the kiddo run around, took lots of pictures and just had a fun and easy day.  Finished off with yet another fabulous meal and headed back to pack up.  

3 - Had breakfast at the hotel, checked out, walked to the train and transferred to NRT.  Checked in for the flight, dropped off our wifi and sat in the lounge until our flight left.  

Overall it was really a great trip - we packed a lot in, but never felt overwhelmed.  We could have seen more, sure, but for us, it was perfect, and now everyone wants to go back!  (win for me!) I know this won't be everyone's ideal trip, and I'm sure there will be lots who disapprove of our itinerary, but I hope it helps someone!  The trains were a breeze, even with the kiddo and parents, but we are all very seasoned travelers.  The people are great, the food is SOOO good, and we never felt anything less than safe.  We did use the SUCA cards like crazy, google translate, and I absolutely recommend getting some sort of wifi.  I'm sure there's a 100 more things that I could add, but I just don't have time.  Ultimately, if you're thinking of booking a trip to Japan, DO IT!

More than one per circuit?,"We're prepping for creating a cooling wall in our kitchen. There are existing dedicated circuits for a refrigerator (currently a SubZero 680, but about to be replaced with a Thermador column 30"" fridge) and a separate 20A that was used for a built in coffee maker, but is being repurposed for a Thermador column freezer.  We will be also adding a 24"" cooler. The fridge should be all good, but there's a question as to whether we can leverage the existing 20A for both the freezer and cooler columns. Each lists as 15A, but they also each list as 350w. I'm not worried about the need to switch from an accessible breaker - that's covered (it will be a rear plug in), but I need verification hat they can operate off the same 15A or greater circuit. I guess it really comes down to whether their max draw really is 350w as opposed to really needing everything a 15A can offer (which is actually up to 1740W). Is there an LRA issue? 

Basically, I'm hoping someone that is familiar with the installs on these can verify that as long as I've got the available wattage (in this case, 350+250=700W) available, then we're all good to install them both on the same circuit.
