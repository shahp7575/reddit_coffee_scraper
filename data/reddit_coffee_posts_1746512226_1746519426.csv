So I thought I missed a signal from  this guy so I took initiative and asked him to get coffee sometime (not using the word date, also gave him an easy way to say no). he then offered to pay and walked me home but has not reached out since. 

Right now we live a couple hours away now (home during summer break)

We both start summer internships in the same city in late June and he only insinuated wanting to hangout with mutuals this summer not just with me.

I’m getting the vibe that he’s just not interested, but If he was totally not interested why entertain a pseudo-date. ",1,1746519329.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

The thing is, the seller listed a 6-cup model, but a 4-cup one arrived in the box.

I was so surprised at how small it is! In the end, I couldn't return it within the allowed timeframe, so I'm stuck with this coffee maker.

However, I'm happy because it's practically brand new, looks good all around. Also, it's an excuse to participate in this community, which seems to have good vibes and a lot of fun people who help others, very different from what you usually see in other Reddit forums. I'm in a couple of other groups (Iron Maiden and Metallica), and the people there are cool too.

Right now, I'm hoping to learn how to use it (I haven't got a clue).",1,1746519238.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1kfz6m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kfz6m7/is_there_anything_else_that_can_explain_my/,Is there anything else that can explain my symptoms,"Below this is my original post I made in here about possibly gallbladder issues . I have just gotten my results back from my ultrasound and this is what they say FINDINGS:
Visibility is limited by body habitus and bowel gas. Allowing for this, biliary tree, gallbladder and liver appear grossly
unremarkable. No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. No focal hepatic lesions or intrahepatic duct dilatation seen.
Pancreas does appear somewhat echogenic/fatty, but no gross focal lesion seen. The tail is obscured.
Right kidney is normal, measuring 10 cm in length. No stones or hydronephrosis. No ascites or collection seen.
IMPRESSION:
Etiology of symptoms not sonographically apparent. No evidence of cholelithiasis. 
So from what I understand nothing is wrong but I am still experiencing symptoms and lower stomach pain consistently and I am wondering if there is something else I need to be checked for or if it will go away on its own they are no where near as intense but I seem to always have stomach pain 

Hi I am a 24 year old female. 9 weeks postpartum with no known  serious medical issues.
I ended up going to the hospital on March 14 by ambulance because I thought I was having a heart attack. I bent over to help my 4 year old with something and got a sharp pain in the left side which then led to pain all down my left arm, mostly in the shoulder area but radiating towards my hand. I went to lay down about an hour later and the pain in my arm had not gone away. Within seconds of laying down I started to overheat and my heart started racing with burning in my chest my whole body felt terrible I stood up for a minute and it seemed to settle down but then all the symptoms I had laying down started again and I had to have a bowl movement which I did. After the bowl movent things got better a little bit but was coming in waves with the chest pain and I felt like I couldn't breath my neck started to feel heavy almost. So I called an ambulance and they suggested It could be gallbladder I has a drink with anti acid and lidacine. Which seemed to make the burning almost no existent. They took blood from me and I wait from about 12am to 5:30 am with no answers so I left because my partner had too work and I had a 9 week old and 4 year old to take care of. On the 15th of march,Because they told me it could be a gallbladder issue I did some research to see what it was all about. I was a bit weary of eating food so I only had 3 pieces of bread with butter for the majority of the day. At around 5:30pm I took my daughter out to the park I had been having some mild stomach pain in the right side but nothing substantial I assumed it was from falling asleep sitting up in the chair at the hospital the night before. I had part of a coffee and a burger from McDonald's around 6pm probably a bad decision in hindsight. About 15 minutes later I got a sharp pain in my back and right side of abdomen,all my symptoms started back up again burning of the chest feeling like I need to go to the bathroom but this time things feeling more intense on the right side of the body. I drove the ten minutes home and had two bowel movements one regular one and one that would be considered floating withong minutes of each other. I ended up going back to the hospital and they did blood work again. While waiting for doctor the pain in my stomach and back got worse and I had pain going up to my shoulders. I asked for some Tylenol which made it hurt a little less but not completely gone. Around 10:45 pm I saw the er doctor and they looked at my gallbladder with an ultrasound. He said he couldn't see any gallstones and that he would order me a more in depth ultrasound but could take about a month. He said that maybe I am just getting the flu or something and that he doesn't know what is going on with me. I left still in pain and quite confused on what steps to take until the ultrasound. I still have pain in my stomach as I write this now at 7:37 am on March 16th. So I guess what I am asking is does this sound like gallbladder issues or something else? I do have anxiety and thought after the first time it happend it could have been a panick attack. I have more socially based anxiety and have never had a panic attack in my life. now that the second incident occurred at the park I really believe something else is going on just because of how my body feels, the second one was definately more intense pain while the first was more burning in the chest with a little bit of pain. I do not know what to do from here and I am worried about eating anything cause I don't want to make things worse if it is a gallbladder issue. Thank you for your help!

1kfz58q,https://www.reddit.com/r/kereta/comments/1kfz58q/rm16k_employee_scam/,RM16k Employee scam?,"Hi guys, so for context I run a dealership and we have an employee that—let’s call him **H**—just pulled the most spectacular disappearing-deposit trick I’ve ever seen. A customer handed over RM16 000, H proudly walked it over to Accounts, and somehow between his desk and the cashier’s window the cash melted into thin air.



Now H insists he *did* hand it in: says he counted the notes twice, signed a scrap of paper, maybe even blessed the bundle for good luck, and passed it through the counter slot. Accounts counters with an equally passionate “absolutely not, we never saw a single ringgit.” No receipt, no CCTV angle actually catching the hand-off, just a perfect little gap in reality where a fat wad of fifties used to be.



Since then my life has become an endless carousel of calls: the customer wants blood, Finance wants answers, HR wants a policy, and H wants compassion because, in his words, “I’m being framed and nobody believes me.” He’s been pacing the showroom with red eyes and a face that looks like it hasn’t met sleep in a month. Yesterday I found him staring at the petty-cash safe like it might confess.



Here’s the problem. If H really misplaced or pocketed the money, we’re rewarding incompetence—or worse—by keeping him on. If he’s innocent, firing him turns us into the big bad employer who dumped a loyal worker the moment things got messy. Either way, the car still isn’t released, the customer is threatening to live-tweet the collapse of civilisation, and I’m averaging three coffees per hour just to remain vertical.



So, internet jury: do I pull the trigger and terminate H, or do I gamble on his plea for one more week to “find evidence” nobody else has managed to locate? Keeping him means more headaches and a very angry customer camped in the lobby. Letting him go might solve the optics but leaves an empty desk and, quite possibly, one more person convinced the world is out to get him.



What would you do with Employee H? Fire, suspend, or roll the dice that the money magically reappears?   
  
Btw i just received word that the customer just gave up trying to get it back. 

Errrrr...

1kfz56a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kfz56a/should_i_meet_him_for_coffee/,Should I meet him for coffee?,"My boyfriend dumped me 3 days ago. He had made a rather big mistake the week before (my nanna was on her deathbed, I was waiting for the call from my dad to say she had passed and he went climbing, despite me asking him to stay with me, he left me all alone in a house that wasn’t mine for 4 hrs, he said he’d only be 2, and he was without cell service). I was furious, I was grieving my Nanna, I said he was selfish, I told him I couldn’t accept his condolences, nothing felt genuine anymore. 

But I am a tolerant person, he is a young boy (21) and I wanted to repair it. Sadly, he didn’t, he saw this situation as a realisation that he DID want to to be selfish, he couldn’t be there for me. I think he realised he didn’t love me anymore. That’s the only reason I can think why someone wouldn’t show up for you in your time of need and grieving. 

He dumped me over the phone a week after her death, but said he still wants to meet me the following week as we had planned (we are semi-long distance). I don’t know if I should go, when I think about what I would say in my head its mostly reasons I think we should try again, or wanting to ask him why he doesn’t love me, or how long he’s felt this way.",1,1746518870.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1kfz51n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kfz51n/the_jar_of_days/,The Jar of Days,"This is a dream I had about Piolo Pascual—a well-known Filipino actor and singer. Ugh, honestly, such a *dreamy* guy. I’ve always had the biggest crush on him since I was a wee girl. Those brown, tantalizing eyes? And that smile that could make any girl go weak in the knees? LMAO.

This was a whole-ass dream. A *lot* happened, but I didn’t write it down right after waking up. Not gonna lie, I got a little lazy and just wanted to bask in the good vibes. And no, this wasn’t a sex dream, lol—I wouldn’t even wish for it to be. It wasn’t about that. I just really enjoyed how *wholesome* it felt, like I was some giddy schoolgirl with a silly crush.

Aside from remembering the *feeling* I got from it, this is the only memory I have left:

I went to Piolo’s place—he had asked me to drop by for coffee, said he wanted to talk about something. So I did. I knocked, waited.

“Come in. It’s open,” I heard him say.

I stepped inside. It wasn’t the usual cold, minimalist place most guys lean toward. It looked *lived in.* There were trinkets everywhere—little things, like the kind you collect without meaning to. I even spotted Harry Potter memorabilia and instantly smiled. Stupidly cute. He had shelves of board games—*dozens*. What a dork, I thought. But it didn’t feel messy. It felt… cozy.

I hadn’t *meant* to snoop.

Okay—*maybe* I had. Just a little. But the jar was right there, sitting quietly on the bedside table like it *wanted* to be read.

Piolo had stepped out to get the coffee. He was always warm like that—always making sure my cup had just enough. Like he somehow *knew* when my heart was aching or when my thoughts were too loud. I was still giddy from our walk earlier—that not-quite-a-date that somehow felt like the start of something real. The shared laughs, the soft brushes of fingers, the way he looked at me when I spoke about life—as if I had just whispered some sacred truth.

And then I saw it.

A clear glass jar, filled with folded notes, each one dated in neat, even handwriting.

“Daily reflections,” the little tag on the lid read.

Like a diary, but undone. Fragile. Fleeting. Like dreams.

My fingers trembled as I reached in, heart pounding like a thief in a sacred place. I unfolded one note at random—something about a fan encounter that left him feeling grounded. Another note: a song he heard at the gym that reminded him of his mother.

And then I found it.

Dated the same day as *our walk*.

>“Took her to that quiet bookstore she mentioned once in passing. She remembered the smell of old pages. I remembered how she smiled when I offered to carry her bag. I don’t know if it was a date, but I didn’t want the day to end. Her laugh stayed with me. Might be staying longer than I expected.”

My breath caught. Just a little.

I didn’t hear the door open, but I *felt* it when he returned. The energy in the room shifted—like warmth folding around me.

Then, a quiet chuckle.

“You found the jar,” he said softly.

Startled, I turned. Froze.

“I—uh—I didn’t mean to—”

But he didn’t look angry. Just amused. His eyes crinkled in that way only his did—soft brown and knowing. He walked over, gently took the note from my hand, and dropped it back into the jar.

“You could’ve just asked,” he teased, voice low. “I would’ve told you.”

And then came *that smile.*

The one you don’t forget, even in dreams. The one that says *I see you. You matter.*

He handed me the mug—coffee with cream and honey.

“Next time, I’ll let you read it out loud.”

I looked away, wrapping my fingers around the mug, its warmth seeping into my skin. I bit my lip to stifle a smile. This is so stupid. So simple. But God, how he made me feel.

Gah! I’m no writer, okay? So I know this sounds kind of basic or cliché, maybe even cheesy. But it’s the best way I can describe that moment in the dream. I remember this part more vividly than whatever “date” we had.

And my god—I’m smiling like an idiot just remembering it.

Some dreams, no? They make you feel like you can conquer *anything*. Or at least, they carry you through the whole day.",1,1746518852.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1kfz4rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kfz4rb/sky_team_coffee_tokens_and_speed/,Sky Team - Coffee tokens and Speed,"Hello

If I use a coffee token to modify a die placed on an engine space and the new sum is above the orange aerodynamic marker, do we then approach the airport by an extra 1 space or do we approach it by an additional 2 spaces?

So imagine our orange aerodynamic marker is between 8 and 9.
We place 5 and 3 on the engine spaces (5+3=8), we move the Approach track by one.
One of us, uses a coffee token to modify one die. E.g. 5 is modified to a 6. The new total is now 9.
Do we move the Approach track by an additional one space or by two spaces?

Also, side question, does the track move if the new sum is in the same range? So, if the orange aerodynamic marker was at 8, our dice total was 11 (we moved by 2 already), we then modified the sum to be 12, do we move by two again?

1kfz4ql,https://youtu.be/xF0OWynnAuI,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping Stalker Horror Stories,"""**Whispers in the Pines: A Honeymoon Stalked**"":

My wife, Emily, and I were over the moon for our honeymoon. It was August 2016, and we’d planned a 20-day camping trip at Pine Ridge Campground, nestled deep in the Rocky Mountains. The place was like a postcard—towering pine trees, their needles carpeting the ground, a crisp breeze carrying the scent of sap and earth, and a clear river gurgling nearby. Our camper was small but cozy, just enough space for us and our two dogs, Max and Bella, who bounded around, chasing squirrels and sniffing every rock. The first few days were pure bliss. We hiked winding trails, grilled burgers over a crackling fire, and even helped a couple of newbies at the next site pitch their tent. Everything felt perfect, like we were living in a dream.Around day four or five, things took a turn. It was late afternoon, the sun dipping low, casting long shadows across the campground. I was tossing a tennis ball for Max and Bella near our site when this woman appeared, like she’d stepped out of thin air. She was maybe in her 30s, with tangled, greasy hair and clothes that looked like they hadn’t been washed in weeks—faded jeans and a stained flannel shirt. Her eyes were intense, almost too focused, and she stared right at me, not blinking.“Can I pet your dog?” she asked, her voice flat, like she was reading from a script.I glanced at Max and Bella. They’d frozen, hackles up, growling low in their throats. That was weird—they’re mutts, part lab, part who-knows-what, and they love everyone. Kids, old folks, other dogs, doesn’t matter. But now they were baring their teeth, ears pinned back. “Uh, they’re a bit worked up right now,” I said, trying to keep it light. “Maybe later.”She didn’t respond, just stood there, her hands limp at her sides, staring at me. The air felt heavy, like the moment before a storm. I shifted my weight, waiting for her to say something, anything, but she just kept staring, her face blank. Finally, after what felt like forever, she turned and walked off, her boots crunching on the gravel. I watched her head to a site maybe three or four spots down, close enough that I could see her setting up a small, weathered tent. Too close.Emily came out of the camper, wiping her hands on a dish towel. “Who was that?” she asked, squinting toward the woman’s site.“Some camper,” I said, still watching her. “Asked to pet the dogs, but they went nuts. Didn’t even wag their tails. Kinda creepy.”Emily frowned, tucking a strand of brown hair behind her ear. “That’s not like them. Let’s keep an eye on her, okay?”“Yeah,” I said, but my stomach was already knotting up. I’ve worked with people with brain injuries before, so I’m used to odd behavior, but this felt different. There was something off about her, something I couldn’t pin down.The next morning, I grabbed my toothbrush and headed to the campground’s bathroom, a basic cinderblock building near the river. The path cut through a patch of trees, and as I rounded a bend, there she was. She was standing by the water, completely naked, her clothes in a pile at her feet. She didn’t move, didn’t cover herself, just stared at me, her eyes locked on mine. My face burned, and I dropped my gaze, muttering, “Sorry,” as I hurried past, my heart pounding. I practically ran back to the camper, slamming the door behind me.“Emily, you won’t believe this,” I said, catching my breath. “That woman was out there, buck naked, just standing by the river, staring at me.”Emily’s eyes widened, her coffee mug frozen halfway to her mouth. “What? Like, on purpose?”“I don’t know,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck. “She didn’t say anything, didn’t even move. It was… wrong.”“That’s not okay,” Emily said, setting her mug down hard. “Maybe she’s just eccentric or something, but that’s creepy.”“Let’s just avoid her,” I said, but I couldn’t shake the image of her standing there, unflinching, like she wanted me to see.That afternoon, we decided to clear our heads with a hike. We picked a trail that climbed up the mountain, a four-mile loop with views of the valley. The dogs trotted ahead, sniffing the dirt, and Emily and I held hands, trying to recapture the honeymoon vibe. About a mile in, I glanced back and saw her. She was maybe 50 yards behind us, walking slowly, her head down, hands stuffed in her pockets. I nudged Emily. “Don’t look now, but she’s following us.”Emily’s grip tightened on my hand. “Are you serious?” She stole a glance, her face paling. “What the hell is her deal?”“Let’s test it,” I whispered. We stopped by a stream to let the dogs drink, pretending to adjust our packs. She stopped too, maybe 30 yards back, just standing there, staring at the ground. My skin crawled. “Okay, that’s not a coincidence,” I said.“Let’s speed up,” Emily said, her voice tight. We started jogging, the dogs bounding ahead, distracted by a rustling in the bushes—probably a chipmunk. The trail twisted through dense pines, and when I looked back again, she was gone. But the whole hike, I kept checking over my shoulder, half-expecting her to pop out from behind a tree. By the time we got back to camp, my shirt was soaked with sweat, and not just from the exercise.That night, Emily went to borrow some matches from two girls camping a few sites over. She came back, her face pale, clutching the matches like they were a lifeline. “Those girls said that woman set up her tent on their site yesterday, no warning, no asking. They told her to leave, and she just stared at them, didn’t say a word, then packed up and moved to her spot.”“That’s not normal,” I said, my voice low. “She’s got issues.”“We need to be careful,” Emily said, locking the camper door. “I don’t like this.”Around 2 a.m., a scream tore through the silence. It was sharp, human, and way too close. Max and Bella went berserk, barking and clawing at the door, their fur bristling. I bolted upright, my heart hammering, and grabbed the flashlight. Emily was already awake, her eyes wide. “What was that?” she whispered.I crept to the window, pulling the curtain back just enough to see. There she was, standing maybe 10 feet from our camper, illuminated by the moonlight. She was fully clothed this time, but her face was blank, like a mannequin’s, staring straight at our window. My blood ran cold. “Emily, it’s her,” I hissed. “She’s right outside.”Emily scrambled for her phone. “We need to call the ranger.”“Let’s wait till morning,” I said, my voice shaking. “She’s not doing anything… yet.” I didn’t want to admit how scared I was, but my hands were trembling as I gripped the flashlight.We watched, barely breathing, until she turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows. Neither of us slept after that. At first light, I went outside to check the site. My stomach dropped when I saw them—footprints in the soft dirt, circling our camper, some as close as a foot from the door. They were small, definitely hers. She’d been out there, pacing around us, in the middle of the night.“We’re not imagining this,” Emily said, staring at the prints. “She’s dangerous.”A couple days later, our friends Mike and Jen drove up to join us for the weekend. We didn’t tell them about her, hoping a bigger group would keep things normal. That evening, we were roasting marshmallows around the fire, the dogs sprawled out nearby, when she showed up again. She walked right into our site, uninvited, carrying a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine. Her smile was too wide, like she was trying too hard to look friendly.“Mind if I join?” she asked, her voice syrupy, sitting on a log before anyone answered.Mike, always the joker, laughed. “What’s this, a gang bang or something?” He winked at me, but I shot him a look. This wasn’t funny.Emily’s jaw tightened, her knuckles white around her beer can. “We’re kind of having a private thing here,” she said, her voice like steel.“Oh, I don’t mind,” the woman said, scooting closer to me. Her knee brushed mine, and I flinched. “You guys seem fun. I could stay with you, you know. Keep you safe out here.”The air went dead. Jen’s eyes darted to me, wide with alarm. Mike’s grin faded. I stood up, my heart pounding. “I think it’s best if you go back to your own site,” I said, trying to sound calm.She stared at me, then at Emily, then at the fire. For a second, I thought she’d argue, but she stood, still clutching her wine bottle, and walked off without a word. The crackle of the fire was the only sound for a long moment.“What the hell was that?” Mike finally said, his voice low.“We’ve been dealing with her all week,” I admitted, running a hand through my hair. “She’s been following us, showing up at night, circling our camper. I think she’s unhinged.”“You need to get out of here,” Jen said, her voice urgent. “That’s not just weird—that’s dangerous.”Emily and I locked eyes. She nodded, her face set. “Let’s pack up tomorrow,” she said. “I’m done.”We barely slept that night, jumping at every rustle outside. At dawn, we tore down camp faster than we ever had, stuffing sleeping bags and cookware into the camper while the dogs paced nervously. Mike and Jen helped, keeping watch, but she didn’t show up. Not until we were pulling [out.As](http://out.As) I maneuvered the camper onto the main road, I glanced in the side mirror. There she was, standing by her tent, motionless, watching us. She didn’t wave, didn’t move, just stared, her eyes boring into us even from a distance. My hands shook on the steering wheel, and I pressed the gas a little harder.We never went back to Pine Ridge. We didn’t report her—looking back, maybe we should have, but we just wanted to put it behind us. I still wonder who she was, what she wanted. Was she lost in her own head, struggling with something we couldn’t see? Or was it something darker? All I know is those eyes, that blank stare, will stay with me forever. And the feeling that, out there in the mountains, we barely got away.





""**Whispers in the Wilderness**"":

I’ve never been one for scary stories, but what happened to me and my girlfriend, Sarah, on the Appalachian Trail in Virginia still haunts me. It was early October, and the forest was alive with color—leaves in fiery reds, oranges, and golds, crunching under our boots. We’d planned a quiet weekend hiking and camping, craving solitude after months of city life. The southern stretch of the trail, winding through the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, seemed perfect. It’s a 166-mile ribbon of wilderness, remote enough to feel like you’re the only soul for miles. We chose a spot off the main path, a small clearing tucked among towering pines and moss-covered rocks, far from the usual hiker crowds. The air smelled of damp earth and sap, and the silence was so deep it felt like the world was holding its breath. Looking back, that isolation was our first mistake.We’d hiked about eight miles that first day, our packs heavy with gear—tent, sleeping bags, a small stove, and my revolver, a Judge I always carried in the backcountry. I’d grown up around guns, and with bears and the occasional sketchy hiker out there, it felt like a necessity. Sarah wasn’t thrilled about it, but she trusted me. We set up camp as the sun dipped below the trees, casting long shadows across the clearing. The air turned crisp, our breath visible in the fading light. We built a small fire, just enough to heat some canned chili, and sat on a fallen log, joking about how we smelled like sweat and dirt.“You’re gonna scare the bears away with that stench,” Sarah teased, her green eyes catching the firelight.I grinned, tossing a stick into the flames. “Good. More chili for us.”We laughed, the sound swallowed by the vastness of the forest. After eating, we doused the fire, brushed our teeth with bottled water, and crawled into the tent. The nylon walls felt flimsy against the dark, but I zipped us in tight, my revolver tucked into my pack beside me. Sarah curled up in her sleeping bag, her blonde hair spilling over the pillow. I fell asleep to the rhythm of her breathing, the forest quiet outside.It was 2 a.m. when Sarah shook me awake, her hand cold on my arm. “Jake, get your gun,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Someone’s outside.”I snapped awake, heart slamming against my ribs. “What’d you hear?” I hissed, fumbling for the revolver. My fingers found the grip, and I flicked off the safety, the click loud in the silence.“Footsteps,” she said, her eyes wide and glassy in the dark. “Circling the tent. It’s not an animal, Jake. It’s too… careful.”I held my breath, listening. The forest was unnaturally still—no crickets, no owls, no rustle of leaves in the wind. Then I heard it: a soft crunch, like boots on dry leaves, maybe 20 feet from the tent. It moved slow, deliberate, pausing every few steps. Crunch. Pause. Crunch. My mouth went dry, and a cold sweat prickled my skin. Sarah clutched my arm, her nails biting into me.“Stay here,” I whispered, my voice barely steady. I unzipped the tent flap an inch, just enough to peek out. The moonlight was faint, filtered through clouds, casting the clearing in shades of gray. Pines loomed like sentinels, their branches swaying slightly. I scanned the tree line, revolver heavy in my hand. Then I saw it—a shadow, human-shaped, darting behind a thick pine. My stomach lurched. It wasn’t a bear or a deer. It was a person.“Hey!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear and adrenaline. “We’re armed! Get the fuck out of here!”The footsteps stopped. Sarah let out a small whimper behind me, her hands gripping the sleeping bag. I kept the revolver aimed at the darkness, my pulse roaring in my ears. Nothing moved. No sound, not even the wind. I waited, sweat dripping down my neck despite the October chill. After what felt like an eternity, I zipped the flap shut, my hands shaking so bad I fumbled the zipper.“Did you see them?” Sarah asked, her voice so soft I barely heard it.“Yeah,” I said, trying to keep my tone calm. “Just one guy, I think. Probably gone now.”I didn’t believe my own words. We didn’t sleep after that. We sat back-to-back in the tent, my revolver in my lap, Sarah clutching a flashlight like it was a lifeline. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig made us flinch. The night stretched on forever, the darkness pressing against the tent like it wanted in.Morning finally came, the sky turning a dull gray. I crawled out first, revolver still in hand, and checked the clearing. The firepit was cold, our gear untouched, but then I saw it—a bootprint in the soft dirt near the tent. It was big, with deep, aggressive treads, nothing like my hiking boots or Sarah’s smaller ones. My gut twisted into a knot. Whoever was out here had been close, close enough to touch the tent. I kicked dirt over the print, not wanting Sarah to see it. She was already scared enough.“We should move,” I said when she emerged, her face pale and eyes red from no sleep. “Get closer to the trailhead.”She nodded, chewing her lip. “Was someone really out there, Jake? Or was it just… I don’t know, the wind?”“Probably a hiker, got lost,” I lied, forcing a smile. “Let’s just go, okay?”She didn’t buy it, but she didn’t push. We packed in silence, skipping breakfast, our appetites gone. The forest felt different now, the beauty replaced by something menacing. The trees seemed to lean in, their shadows too long, too dark. I kept my revolver in a holster on my hip, one hand on it as we hiked. Sarah stayed close, her hiking poles clicking nervously against rocks. We moved fast, covering miles, but the feeling of being watched never left. I kept glancing back, expecting to see someone behind us, but the trail was empty. Still, my skin crawled, like eyes were burning into my back.By late afternoon, we were exhausted, our legs aching from the pace. We found a new spot to camp, a small ledge near a cliff overhang. It wasn’t ideal—rocky and exposed—but it felt safer. The cliff at our backs meant no one could sneak up from behind, and the open approach gave us a clear view. We set up the tent, wedging it between boulders, and I checked the area for tracks. Nothing. Still, I wasn’t taking chances.I pulled my 1911 pistol from my pack and handed it to Sarah. “You see anyone, point and shoot,” I said, showing her how to hold it. “Safety’s here. Don’t hesitate.”Her hands trembled as she took it, her fingers clumsy. “Jake, I’ve never shot a gun before.”“You won’t need to,” I said, trying to sound confident. “It’s just in case.”She looked at me, eyes searching. “Don’t leave me, okay?”“Never,” I said, pulling her into a quick hug. Her hair smelled like campfire smoke, and I held her a second longer than I meant to.We ate a cold dinner—protein bars and water—too nervous to start a fire. The sun set fast, the sky turning inky black. We crawled into the tent, zipping it tight, and sat in silence, listening to the night. The wind picked up, whistling through the rocks, but it didn’t drown out the fear in my chest. Sarah kept the pistol in her lap, her knuckles white around it. I held the revolver, my thumb brushing the trigger guard.Around midnight, it started. A rustling, close, like someone digging through our packs outside. The sound was unmistakable—fabric shifting, zippers scraping. My blood turned to ice. Sarah gasped, her hand flying to my arm.“Jake,” she hissed, raising the pistol.I put a finger to my lips, heart pounding so loud I thought they’d hear it. I unzipped the flap an inch, peering out. The moonlight was brighter tonight, silver on the rocks. Our packs, left just outside, were open, gear scattered—our stove, a water bottle, Sarah’s jacket. Someone had been through them. I gripped the revolver, rage mixing with fear.“Who’s there?” I shouted, throwing the flap open. “We’re armed! Back off!”The rustling stopped. I stepped out, flashlight in one hand, revolver in the other, sweeping the beam across the ledge. Nothing. Just rocks and shadows. Then I saw them—two pinpoints of light, like lanterns, flickering down by the creek 50 yards below. They swayed, moving slowly, like someone carrying them. My breath caught. There wasn’t just one person. There were at least two.“Sarah, pack up,” I said, ducking back into the tent. “We’re leaving. Now.”“What?” she whispered, voice shaking. “It’s pitch black out there!”“We’re not safe,” I said, already shoving my sleeping bag into my pack. “They’re down by the creek. We go now, we can lose them.”She didn’t argue, but her hands fumbled as she stuffed her gear. We moved fast, tearing down the tent, not bothering to fold it. My flashlight beam danced wildly as we slung on our packs. The night was cold, the wind biting through my jacket. We started down the trail, moving as quietly as we could, but our boots crunched on gravel, loud in the silence. Every step felt exposed, like we were being hunted.Half a mile in, we heard it—voices, low and muffled, somewhere behind us. Not words, just the hum of conversation, too far to make out but close enough to raise the hairs on my neck. I grabbed Sarah’s arm, pulling her off the trail into a thicket of rhododendrons. We crouched low, branches scratching our faces, and turned off the flashlight. The voices grew louder, then faded, like they’d passed by. I couldn’t tell if they were looking for us or just hiking, but I wasn’t taking chances.We waited, shivering in the dark, until the forest was quiet again. My legs cramped, but we didn’t move for what felt like hours. When we finally crept back to the trail, the sky was lightening, a faint gray creeping over the horizon. We hiked fast, exhaustion making my vision blur. Sarah was silent, her face drawn, the pistol still in her hand.Just before dawn, I saw him. A figure, maybe 100 yards back, standing dead still on the trail. He was tall, wearing a hooded jacket, his face hidden in shadow. He didn’t move, didn’t call out—just watched us. My heart stopped. I tightened my grip on the revolver, ready to raise it.“Jake, what is it?” Sarah asked, her voice barely a whisper. She followed my gaze, and I felt her tense beside me.“Don’t look,” I said, pulling her forward. “Keep walking. Don’t stop.”She obeyed, her steps shaky. I kept glancing back, expecting him to follow, but he stayed there, a silent statue in the half-light. The trail curved, and he vanished behind a ridge. I didn’t know if he was still watching, but the weight of his stare clung to me.We reached the trailhead just as the sun broke over the mountains, our car a glorious sight in the gravel lot. We threw our packs in the trunk, not bothering to sort them, and I peeled out, tires spitting dirt. Sarah sat in the passenger seat, hugging herself, tears streaking her face. I wanted to say something, to make it okay, but my throat was tight, my hands trembling on the wheel.We didn’t report it. What would we say? Some guy watched us? We heard voices? It sounded crazy, and we just wanted to forget it. But I can’t. I see that figure every time I close my eyes, standing there, silent. I hear those footsteps circling our tent, those voices in the dark. Sarah doesn’t talk about it, but she doesn’t hike anymore. Neither do I. The forest used to feel like freedom. Now it feels like a trap, waiting for us to step back in.





""**Whispers in the Blackwood**"":

I’d been counting down the days for this camping trip with my best friend, Nate. We both needed a break from the grind—work, bills, the endless noise of the city. The Blackwood Mountains seemed like the perfect escape, a rugged stretch of forest with trails that promised solitude and views that could make you forget your problems. I’d read about it online, seen pictures of misty valleys and towering pines. Nate was all in, hyping it up as we packed my old pickup truck with gear. “Matt, this is gonna be epic,” he said, tossing a cooler into the bed. “Just us, the woods, no worries.”I smiled, but I was nervous. I’d heard stories—creepy ones—about people running into trouble in remote places like this. Robberies, weirdos, stuff you don’t think about when you’re dreaming of campfires. Nate caught my frown and laughed, punching my arm. “You’re already freaking out, aren’t you? It’s just trees, man. Relax.”The drive out was gorgeous. We left at dawn, the highway cutting through rolling hills as the sun climbed, painting everything gold. We cranked the radio, singing off-key to old rock songs, the windows down, cool air smelling of grass and earth. By noon, we hit the gravel road to the trailhead, my truck rattling over bumps. The forest closed in, pines and oaks so thick they blocked the sky. It felt like we were driving into another world.We parked at the trailhead, a dusty lot with a faded sign warning about bears and fire safety. No other cars, which was both cool and unsettling. We strapped on our backpacks—heavy with tents, food, and a couple beers—and started hiking. The trail was narrow, carpeted with pine needles, the air sharp with sap. Birds sang, and a breeze rustled the leaves. It was perfect, exactly what I’d wanted. But about an hour in, something felt off.I stopped to adjust my pack, scanning the trees. “Nate, you feel that?” I asked, keeping my voice low.He turned, wiping sweat from his forehead. “Feel what? You good?”“I don’t know,” I said, squinting into the forest. The hairs on my neck were up. “Like… someone’s watching us.”Nate snorted, shaking his head. “You’ve been watching too many slasher flicks. It’s just us out here, Matt. Come on.”I forced a laugh, but I couldn’t shake it. The forest was too quiet now, the birds gone silent. I swore I saw something—a flicker of movement, a shadow slipping behind a tree. My heart sped up, but I didn’t say anything. Nate was already ribbing me, and I didn’t want to sound paranoid. Still, every step felt heavier, like eyes were burning into my back. I kept glancing over my shoulder, expecting to see someone, but it was just trees and more trees.“Seriously, what’s with you?” Nate asked after I tripped over a root, my head swiveling to check behind us again.“I heard something,” I admitted. “Like a branch snapping. Back there.”He stopped, listening. The wind hissed through the pines, but nothing else. “You’re hearing things, man. It’s the wilderness. Stuff moves. Squirrels, deer, whatever. Let’s keep going.”I nodded, but my gut screamed something was wrong. I tried to focus on the trail, the crunch of our boots, the weight of my pack. By late afternoon, we found a clearing near a shallow creek, the water glinting in the fading light. It was a good spot—flat, sheltered by trees, with a natural fire pit from some past camper. We dropped our packs, both of us sweaty and ready to rest.“This is it,” Nate said, grinning as he stretched. “Home sweet home.”We set up the tent, a green two-person deal we’d borrowed from Nate’s brother. I gathered wood while Nate got the fire going, the smell of smoke mixing with the damp earth. We cooked hot dogs over the flames, the kind that taste better when you’re starving and surrounded by nothing but nature. The sky turned purple, then black, stars popping out like someone flipped a switch. For a while, I forgot my nerves. We cracked open a couple beers, the cans cold in our hands, and talked about dumb stuff—old high school pranks, girls we’d crushed on, how we should’ve done this trip years ago.“You were freaking out earlier,” Nate said, poking the fire with a stick. Sparks floated up, disappearing into the dark. “See? Nothing but us and the stars.”“Yeah, you’re right,” I said, leaning back on a log. The fire warmed my face, and the creek’s soft gurgle was calming. “Guess I’m just not used to the quiet.”“City boy,” he teased, tossing a twig at me. “You’ll survive.”We put out the fire around 10:30, the embers glowing red as we crawled into the tent. I zipped the door, double-checking it, and lay in my sleeping bag, the ground hard under my back. Nate was out fast, snoring softly, but I couldn’t sleep. The forest sounds—crickets, wind, the creek—were soothing, but that uneasy feeling crept back. I stared at the tent ceiling, my mind replaying that shadow I’d seen, the snap of a branch. I told myself it was nothing, just my imagination running wild.Then I heard it. A crunch. Slow, deliberate, like a boot on dry leaves. My breath caught. I lay still, ears straining. Another crunch, closer. My heart slammed against my ribs. “Nate,” I whispered, nudging him hard. “Wake up.”He groaned, rolling over. “What, man?”“Listen,” I hissed. Another crunch, then a faint rustle. Something was out there, moving around our camp. Nate sat up, his eyes wide in the dark. Before he could speak, a light flashed through the tent—a bright beam, sweeping across the fabric. My stomach dropped.“What the hell is that?” Nate whispered, his voice tight.I couldn’t answer. The beam moved, circling the tent, slow and steady. My mind raced—ranger? Hunter? But why now, why here? Then a voice cut through the silence, low and rough, like gravel. “Get out here. Now.”I froze, my blood like ice. Nate grabbed my arm, his fingers digging in. “Matt, what do we do?” he whispered, barely audible.“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. The light stopped, pinning the tent door. Then a sound I’ll never forget—a metallic click, the unmistakable cock of a gun.“I said get out!” the voice barked, louder, meaner.We scrambled, unzipping the tent with trembling hands. I crawled out first, Nate right behind, our hands raised. The flashlight hit my eyes, blinding me, but I saw the shape of a man—tall, broad, wearing a dark jacket and boots. In his other hand, a shotgun, the barrel pointed right at us. My legs wobbled, barely holding me up.“Wallets, phones, anything you got,” he growled, stepping closer. The light kept us pinned, but I caught a glimpse of his face—hard, unshaven, eyes cold as stone. “Put it on the ground. Slow.”“Okay, okay,” I stammered, fumbling for my wallet. My hands shook so bad I nearly dropped it. Nate tossed his phone, a few bucks, and his keys into the dirt, his face pale. The man watched, the gun steady, his breath heavy in the cold air.“Please,” Nate said, his voice cracking. “Just take it. We won’t do anything.”The man laughed, a short, nasty sound that made my skin crawl. “You think you’re safe out here?” he said, kicking our stuff into a pile. “Two city kids, all alone. Easy pickings.” He stepped closer, the barrel inches from my chest. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. My whole world was that gun.“Don’t move,” he said, his voice low now, almost calm. I thought that was it, that he’d shoot us and leave us for the animals. Then he raised the shotgun and fired into the air. The blast was deafening, a roar that echoed through the trees. I flinched, my ears ringing, my knees buckling. “Run,” he said, the flashlight dropping to his side. “Don’t look back.”We didn’t wait. We bolted, tearing through the dark, branches snapping against my face. I grabbed my flashlight from my pocket, the beam bouncing as we ran. Nate was ahead, his breath ragged, cursing under his breath. “Go, go!” he yelled. I kept expecting another shot, the thud of boots chasing us, but all I heard was my own pulse pounding in my ears. We tripped over roots, slid on loose dirt, but we didn’t stop. The forest was a maze, black and endless, but we kept moving, driven by pure fear.After what felt like forever—maybe a mile, maybe two—we collapsed behind a thick oak, gasping for air. I clicked off the flashlight, plunging us into darkness. We listened, hearts hammering. Nothing. No footsteps, no light, just the wind and our shaky breaths. “Is he gone?” I whispered, my voice hoarse.“I think so,” Nate said, wiping blood from a scratch on his cheek. “Jesus, Matt, what was that?”“I don’t know,” I said, my hands still trembling. “Robbery? Psychopath? I thought we were dead.”We didn’t dare go back. Our tent, our gear, everything was gone, but we weren’t risking it. We stayed low, moving slow now, using the stars and my dimming flashlight to find the trail. The forest felt alive, every rustle making me jump, every shadow a threat. My clothes were soaked with sweat despite the cold, and my legs ached, but we kept going. By dawn, we saw the trailhead, my truck still parked in the lot like nothing had happened. I’d never been so relieved to see that rusty piece of junk.We drove straight to a ranger station, an hour away, the road blurring as I gripped the wheel. Nate was quiet, staring out the window, his hands clenched. At the station, we spilled everything to a ranger with a gray beard and a notepad. His face hardened as we described the man, the shotgun, the robbery. “You’re lucky to be standing here,” he said, setting down his pen. “We’ve had reports before—lone guy, armed, hitting campsites. Slippery bastard, knows these woods better than we do.”They sent a team to search, but they never found him. A week later, we got a call—rangers found our tent, slashed up, and some of our gear scattered. My wallet was empty, Nate’s phone gone. The police chalked it up to a robbery, said we were lucky he didn’t shoot us. Lucky. I didn’t feel lucky. I felt like I’d never sleep right again.Nate and I haven’t gone camping since. We tried talking about it once, over beers at his place, but we didn’t get far. “I keep seeing that gun,” he said, staring at his drink. “Like, what if we hadn’t run?”“I know,” I said, my throat tight. “I keep thinking he was watching us all day. Waiting.”I still love the outdoors, the idea of it—fresh air, open skies. But now we stick to crowded campgrounds, the kind with RVs and families, where you can hear laughter from the next site over. Even then, every snapped twig, every shadow in the trees, sends me back to that night in the Blackwood Mountains, staring into the dark, knowing someone was staring back.

 i wasnt allowed to touch my own hair until i was 12/13 and if it wasnt done perfectly the way my mother wanted, i would be forced to get braids. i now am uncapable of touching my own hair in fear that i will get yelled at again. i struggle to use anything that isnt solely my own (bathroom/kitchen/living area/ shared household items) because ive been reminded constantly that i own nothing. that i shouldnt be/have a right to be in their spaces. not even my room was my own. i want allowed to lock the door even to change. my mother refused to knock and would scream at me every time i did so. if i decorated the top of my dresser the way i liked, she would destroy it and decorate it the way she wanted.

 if we went shopping and i said i didnt like something they wanted me to wear, i was being difficult and made to seem like a bad child for not liking a certain shirt or pair of pants. even as an adult my older sister would prevent me from wearing things i likes and even when out of her way to tell me how ridiculous and stupid i looked for going outside in a pink crop top then berate me again when i covered up with a jacket. i still cant wear anything i actually like even if no one is home to see. my birthdays never mattered unless it was about them and if i tried not to let it be, i was difficult, selfish, and vindictive. if they didnt plan something on that day, they would watch me blow out the candles and then leave me alone again. looking back, the house was always empty even though i was never the only one home. 

i was never praised for anything and they would find reason to find fault with me. i made a's and b's all year? okay. i make a c? i would be looked at like i was a bad person. i struggle and make a d? i was berated and they acted like i did something to slight them on purpose and they looked like they would hurt me. 

i had to constantly be the mediator between adults fighting. make plans, grocery shop, budget for them. remember everything and god forbid if i forgot something. i couldn't even tell them that i fell off a stool and hit my head on the corner of the coffee table once because i was too afraid bother them. i was always dramatic, i was never allowed to be sick other than on saturdays because i was just trying to get out of something or ruin their day. when i actually came down with a chronic illness, they made sure to remind me every time they had to pick me up from school how much of a disappointment i was, how im just trying to make their lives difficult and i just want to play hooky. they would even force me out of the wheelchair the nurse had to bring me out in even though i was struggling to even stand. 

nothing i did was good enough, i was incapable of being well behaved but if they even thought i was thinking the opposite, i would be treated like a villain. i learned never to ask for things, never to expect to be treated well. i learned that my needs were an inconvenience and i was selfish for them to be met even if it was a very easy fix. i learned that it was my fault that i was never taught how to ride a bike, drive, ect and that im a huge burden for not knowing or asking for help to learn. yet if i try to buy a bike to learn on my own, then im told that we need to discuss it as a family and that im going to ruin my life. if i tried to hangout with a friend (a boy) they would call the entire family so that they would call me and make fun of me the entire time.

i cannot touch my own hair, i cannot wear my own clothes, i struggle to use basic household items because they dont belong only to me, im afraid to ride a bike, im afraid to go to college, im incapable of asking for help as it never existed to me. im afraid to leave my room, im unable to do anything i havent been told to do. i have a huge aversion to love and relationships. if someone is kind to me, it activates my fight or flight.

yet through all of it, i never realized how badly i was being hurt. i thought it was normal and i didnt feel much. im autistic and looking back that might have been my saving grace. i didnt feel lonely because i couldnt feel much of anything. the stress went unnoticed and so did most of the sadness. unfortunately, it seems it was all so bad that it may have been the cause of my chronic illness in the first place. so now im stuck in the environment that made me ill in the first place. how do you heal the wounds when youre unaware of 90% of the things that hurt you? is it even possible?",1,1746518779.0,ChildhoodTrauma,1,1.0,False

(REVIEW)","Hello and welcome to the first part of a - hopefully long - series of Reviews featuring Youtube Videos and  essays about the East India Company! Though several candidates have been considered as the initial subject for this series, I have opted to feature the 10-minute overview from ''[World History Encyclopedia](https://www.youtube.com/@WorldHistoryEncyclopedia)'' (to be abbreviated henceforth as 'WHE') to start off with. Not only because its brevity provides a convenient opener to this format, but also due to the fact that the video is - in both my personal as well as professional opinion - one of the better, if not the best ones out there on the platform of Youtube. As such, I decided to start off with one of the better entries, rather than one of those deserving of a lot of criticism.

As an initial caveat, or rather an inherent problem with the video - and to be more specific, its length - it is to be noted that the video attempts to cover over 274 years of history in barely over 10 minutes. Whereas other videos of the same length would (or do) remedy that disadvantage by focusing on specific aspects of the EIC's history (in part because they themselves are part of a series spanning over or closer to an hour of runtime), thus being able to delve more into the details and specifics of the events in question, WHE devoted themselves to a Herculean task of covering the East India Company in general and thus automatically losing depth by necessary omission - as there is little time available to begin with, discussing that big a timeframe and different aspects of it inevitably means all of these can only be mentioned with a certain level of superficiality. Thus, there are distinct differences among the videos released on our subject - some dedicating significantly more time and even more videos to it, whereas others are content to tackle the matter with a short-ish overview of 10-15 minutes. In addition, WHE opens itself up to criticism by lack of detail for reasons aforesaid, and in covering different aspects (instead of just one) increasing the chance of making mistakes. While these factors alone would be and probably are worthy of being part of the overall critique, we will instead focus more on the question of: ***How good is that essay as a 10-minute video? How well does it hold up for what it tries to do despite the aforementioned disadvantages?*** With that being said, let us look into it:

[History of the English East India Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9SaD3cV6fc) (video):

>*Queen Elizabeth I granted the EIC a charter for exclusive rights to* ***trade with India*** *and included in this was the permission to wage war.* \- (1:45-1:54)

1.1 The narrator/presenter of the video here makes a very basic albeit quite common mistake. This claim is true insofar as India and the Indian Ocean as region(s) were indeed included in (part of) the territory and area assigned to the East India Company via their first Charter in which their monopoly over English trade was valid for and thus certified. However said Charter was very explicit in defining and delineating the EIC's domain: it technically stretched from the Cape of Good Hope to the Strait of Magellan and further included those parts of the 'Americas' situated to the west of Magellan's strait. In total the complete area of the EIC's monopoly encompassed both the Indian as well as the Pacific Oceans with adjacent territories.

>*...and the EIC expanded from there to take over* ***Bombay as their major Trade Center in 1661****.* \- (2:06-2:12)

1.2 Another fairly common mistake, but moreso an understandable, albeit basic one. Hence I consider this to be a rather minor part of criticism. King Charles II. of England acquired the Portuguese settlement in Bombay in 1662 as a dowry for his marriage to the Portuguese princess Catherina de Braganza. Based on this somewhat well-known fact, it is often assumed that with this marriage, the English East India Company automatically assumed control of said Colony immediately thereafter. English possession is thus conflated with Company possession. But the EEIC did not assume administrative responsibility over Bombay until it was bestowed to them via another Royal Charter issued by the King in 1668/69. Said transfer of power is well-documented in both secondary sources as well as the primary sources within the British library.

>*The British government had given the EIC* ***a free hand to do as it pleased*** *(...)* \- (4:34-4:38)

1.3 The nature of the relationship between state and corporation changed quite extensively over time, notably in and after the late 18th century. The notion that England/Britain gave the EEIC a 'free hand' (in other words, a *carte* *blanche*) would be insofar inapt as it cannot and does not apply to their joined history in general, in part due to the transformative connection between the two. Moreover, as the Government and affiliated authorities assumed more control over Indian administration and the EIC itself after 1784, it would be equally incorrect to talk about giving a 'free hand' in that context or time period. That being said, it seems that WHE's presenter description here might be referring to the 17th and early 18th century (which we will assume for giving the benefit of doubt), in which case it would be more accurate, with an important additional point of criticism:

Whereas the EIC indeed had been granted far-reaching privileges to jurisdiction, administration and alike, and in essence had 'mostly' a free hand and a semi-autonomous position in governing the English territories in India, the suggestion of 'free hand' implying 'could do WHATEVER they wanted with no restrictions or mandatory guidelines' does not apply in toto, for instance in matters of legislature, the EIC was obliged to only pass or create laws that were NOT conflicting with English/British law - complete legislative freedom for instance was not given to them.

>*The 1793 Bengal permanent settlement made Tax Collectors also landlords and this Revenue went to the EIC (...)* \- (8:32-8:40)

1.4 The territorial revenues - the tax profits from the controlled regions within India - were at first the sole property of the Company, starting with the diwani as granted to them in the aftermath of the battle of Buxar in 1765 (the diwani, not the battle) for the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. However once the British government inserted itself to increasing degrees into matters of Indian administration and thus asserted as well as enhanced its superior stance in these regards, the territorial revenues - and fiscal matters in general, became one of the essential aspects falling to the control of government-affiliated authorities:

The Board of control, established in 1784 with the 'India Act' became the supreme authority in Indian administration and was also responsible for the tax revenues as part of the 'Indian budget' in 1793. Furthermore in successive Parliament Acts like those in 1813 and 1833 it was the state who could and did mandate how said revenues were to be spent (militarily and debt reduction, mainly). In all fairness, this is more of a nitpick, but worthy of mention regardless.

***That concludes the section of points to be criticised. How then and through which points is the video commendable? Let us now examine the its positive aspects:***

>*This initial Venture went well and was then expanded under King James I when a trading post was established at Surat on the west coast of India* ***between 1612 and 1619*** *(...)* \- (1:55-2:06)

2.1 Whenever the founding or establishing of settlements and outposts is concerned, virtually everyne always picks on one specific date to settle and brings it up as a solid or at least most probable fact. However secondary sources are still split on some of these, such as the founding of the factory at Surat and the year Calcutta came into existence. To acknowledge the diversity in opinions and estimates, WHE presents the timeframe of years in which the various estimates are set, a great attention to detail and accuracy.

>*The EIC grew more powerful under King Charles II who gave the EIC autonomy to conduct its Affairs as it saw fit,* ***especially in efforts that would keep out the Dutch East India company*** *that had already gained a foothold in trade with Indonesia.* \- (2:13-2:27)

2.2 Under the reign of Charles II., the EIC was given extensive privileges that aimed to increase the effectiveness of its governance and administration. In terms of addressing the Companys early history, this particular period is often mentioned, but the underlying reasons for it much less often. Despite the limitations of time, WHE takes the additional effort to - however briefly - not only mention WHAT happened, but also (in part) WHY it happened.

>*In 1698 a rival company was founded in England, a second English East India Company. But the level of coordination between the various EIC centers set it apart from its Rivals and the EIC was able to maintain control. The second company was merged with the first in 1709 and became the United company of merchants Trading to the East Indies (...)* \- (6:36-7:00)

2.3 I am fairly well-versed when it comes to which parts of the EIC's history are mentioned by historically themed Youtube channels and essayists, and based on that I can confidently tell you, the merger between the 'old' East India Company and its new competitor from 1698 is a topic that gets rarely mentioned. It is insofar a niche subject that I would not have expected it to be brought up at all in a video with 10 minutes length. That alone makes the video quite a lot better for me, and as such is to be listed as a net 'positive' in its favour, despite the following criticism:

The way this small period of crisis is presented here, a hitherto unknowledgable viewer would get the impression that the 'old' EIC emerged from this conflict-laden incident with no concessions at all - 'barely an inconvenience'. But it is paramount to mention that said 'older/original' Company did in fact not endure this event (not legally at least) and come out of it unscathed. When its competitor was constituted via Royal Charter in 1698, the King had made good on his threat he had issued a few years earlier: more financial support, otherwise severe consequences (loss of monopoly) would ensue. The new 'English Company trading to the East Indies' had the Crowns support, but could not compete as well against its older rival, who in turn were living on borrowed time without said support. A compromise was mediated which culminated in a merging of the two Companies, in which the old one was absorbed into the new one (or rather its assets) and formally dissolved in 1708/09.

>*The East India Company invested heavily in professional military forces and paid to use British Army regulars. In 1763 the EIC had 6,680 troops in Bengal alone which rocketed to 129,473 troops by 1823.* \-(5:12-5:29)

2.4 Most channels that covered the Companys history did so with a particular focus on its trade networks and large-scale conquest as in its later history. Specifics as to its army composition or detailed numbers get rarely mentioned, sizes of the various presidency armies even less so. Usually the mentioning of the EICs army size is limited to the '260,000 men at its peak', a commonly cited factoid that does provide very little insight without accompanying details such as a year. It is not only quite rare (perhaps even unique among the landscape of Youtube) to see someone mention the size of a particular presidency army, but especially at different points in time, the first at the dawn of the conquest of India. In addition said numbers are not just innately precise, but also accurate - and even more impressively followed shortly after by some remarks devoted to the armies composition and areas/demographics of recruitment.

>*The British government supported the company's policies because many of the shareholders were also high ranking politicians.* \- (1:19-1:27)

>*No one the in British government objected to the eic's missionary policy because by the early 19th century 100 members of parliament were also employees of the EIC.* \- (7:58-8:09)

2.5 Despite a few repeated instances in which the East India Company is referred to in expanding its territory (unbothered by criticism and accusation) which might be read as a separating differentiation in ambitions and goals among the EIC and the state, WHE makes a point (doubly so) about the aligned, intertwined and connected interests and personell shared between them. Whereas other videos might usually push a narrative that absolves the State and its politicians from participation or approval of the EICs policies, WHE here is quite unambiguous about the rightfully mentioned fact that those two entities' policies aligned quite a lot.

>*The EIC focused its attention on India and developed the Triangular Trade in which it exchanged* ***precious metals from Britain*** *for Indian products (...)* \- (2:28-2:36)

>*Among the notable Goods traded by the EIC were porcelain, silk, saltpeter for gunpowder, Indigo, coffee, silver and wool.* \- (3:38-3:46)

>*The ships that carried these goods were heavily armed with cannons and had been given the freedom to fire upon any perceived threats.* \- (3:47-3:55)

2.6 Despite appearing just once or at best twice, the capabilities and versatile nature of the EIC's ships - East Indiamen - is nevertheless being brought up, however shortly. It is by far not the only different aspect of the Companys rich history brought up in a surprisingly diverse video, moreso given its short length, but the effortless transition into and integration of such various angles and sub-topics is done amazingly well. This makes it all the more apparent that the information presented is a 'boiled down' version (condensed) of the various articles from WHE's website, all merged into one. One might not have epected to be confronted with so many different parts of Company history all at once, even less done so well, which is all in all a highly commendable and further successful effort on WHE's part.

In addition, it is immensely relieving to see the variety of the trade commodities of the EICs commercial activities NOT being reduced to 'spices' or 'tea' for once, which would have been a realistic possibility for a video of this length. Nevertheless the viewer is given a comprehensive list of items (especially saltpetre and its use for warfare) and thus provided with a much more accurate depiction of the rich catalogue of the EICs trade network.

>*The Charter Act of 1813 proclaimed British sovereignty over the newly captured territory and formally ended the eic's Monopoly on trade with India.* \- (8:56-9:06)

>*In 1833 the EIC lost its Monopoly on trade with China, diminishing its power. The charter acts of 1833 and 1853 further reduced the eic's strength and the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the uprising of the Indian soldiers known as the Sepoys, employed by the EIC led to the British crown taking full possession of EIC territories in India in 1858, beginning what is known as the time of the British Raj. The EIC was formally dissolved by Parliament on the 1st of June 1874.* \- (9:16-9:48)

2.7 As one of the few channels, WHE makes ample and moreover thorough mention of the changes to the EICs commercial privileges through Parliament Charter Acts. Not only correct in all claims, but refreshing to see it included in the essay. In addition the date of dissolution for the EIC is given equally correctly (1874), which is not a given among the various Youtube channels focusing on historical content (History Matters for instance had claimed the EIC was dissolved immediately after the Mutiny in 1858). 

2.8 Sources: this one might be a bit surprising to be part of the 'positives'-bracket at first glance, given that there are no sources at display within the video or its description. However the latter does link to WHE's own website and to be more precise, several of its published articles on the East India Company, which in turn are not only quite detailed and well articulated, but also well-sourced.

3. Conclusion: Though it is quite apparent that this video inevitably suffers from the same problen every 10-minute overview is faced with (compromising depth by omission due to limited time) and perhaps even more so by covering the EIC's entire history and in addition doing so touching it on several different aspects, I was quite and thoroughly impressed with the richness of detail and information that WHE was able to condense and put into the video. One could watch a 10-minute video without being provided with much substantial, concrete knowledge, but here it is quite the opposite. Despite the fact that WHE could not and did not expand on most of the topics as much as they might have liked to, on several occasions they surprisingly did delve into specifics to such a degree that even some 30-minute videos are void of, such as by mentioning the merger of 1698-1709 or particular army sizes and compositions. I would evaluate the mistakes they committed to be fairly minor (in part because these were common, understandable ones, but also because there were not particularly harmful or false narratives among them), which were more than just compensated by the immensely positive aspects as discussed above. In total, the video is quite a successful one in general, even when compared to longer essays on the platform, but even moreso when judging it for what it could do or what could have been reasonably been expected of it as a 10-minute overview.

My biggest 'concern' - for a lack of a better word - is the oversight made in regards to the somewhat contentious relationship between Company and state over authority and supremacy as to Indian administration and the supposedly autonomous role the EIC enjoyed. An entire segment of the video was dedicated to 'Regulation from the Government' and another to 'Downfall and Takeover', none of which mentioned the Board of Control. However the video seems to have focused on commerce (mentioning revocation of trade privileges, the crisis of 1698, the inland trade and accusations over it) more than military conquest (which became more of a footnote) or the dynamics of power. In addition there was no trace of popular narratives (such as: the state was not involved, all the EIC's doing) being perpetuated, making the aforementioned points oversights rather than blatant inaccuracies, and as such they dont weigh as negatively overall.

###What is Netflix K-Content?

[Previously known as **The Swoon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkLnrtVnjc), **Netflix K-Content** channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpiCK8c6PBktcxq7Az_t4RQ) is Netflix's official social media handle for Korean content on Netflix. Be it K-dramas, K-movies, K-variety or K-celebs that's where you want to go for official goodies from Netflix. 

(It's also the only acceptable source of previews/teasers for Netflix productions.)

**What is the difference between ""Netflix Original"" and ""produced by Netflix”?**

**Netflix Original**: Netflix will label any drama they have exclusive streaming rights to in a certain region as an Netflix Original in that region ***even if*** Netflix is only licensing the content and was not part of the production process.

**Produced by Netflix**: these are dramas that Netflix financed and produced (examples include Kingdom, Love Alarm, My Holo Love, Extracurricular).

**Quick tip** to distinguish between a *licensed* Netflix Original and Netflix production: 

> All episodes released on the same day ***worldwide*** = Netflix production

> vs.

> Episodes released weekly concurrent with its airing schedule in Korea ***OR*** the drama finished airing in Korea but is still unavailable on Netflix = a *licensed* Netflix Original

For more info, check out [Netflix’s Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976) and the article [The Four Types of Netflix Originals](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/the-four-types-of-netflix-originals/).

**Why isn’t [drama] available even though it’s airing in Korea?**

***We don’t know, we’re not Netflix.***  When (if ever) a drama comes to Netflix for any given region depends on the licensing agreement Netflix has. For more info, check out [Netflix’s Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976)

**When is [drama] coming to Netflix for my region?**

***We don’t know, we’re not Netflix.*** Netflix tells you to keep browsing the [New Arrivals](http://www.netflix.com/browse/new-arrivals) page and looking out for its announcements via [Press Releases](https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases).

**How Good Are Netflix's Subtitles?**

Not great: they often skip over nuances in the language. 

Common example of subtitle inferiority include use of the ***name*** of a character throughout no matter what that character is being called in the dialogue. This can at times be a spoiler if the dialogue was being purposely vague.

Another ***very common*** complaint is that due Netflix subtitles often contain more cursing/profanity in comparison to what is actually being said in the Korean dialogue. This has been speculated to be attributed to Netflix's choices for localization of subtitles. So just be aware that cursing in kdramas, especially ones broadcast on any of the free to air channels (KBS, MBC, SBS) are relatively rare and mild.

**Which Dramas Are Dubbed?**

Based on user feedback, it seems that Netflix offers dubbing only on Netflix productions. See the Netflix help article on [How to use subtitles, captions, or alternate audio](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/372) to change your options.

**What's with the music?**

Background music in kdramas may be altered on streaming platforms in comparison to original broadcast due to copyright and licensing issues. Streaming sites will replace songs with generic choices if they do not have the correct licensing. In general, the songs being switched out are ***not original*** songs created ***solely*** for the drama, instead they are pre-existing songs.

***Longer Answer***

**Note: The explanation below is a very simplified look at a very complex legal issue. Use it for reference, not authority.**

In terms of licensing, each individual song can be thought of as having two sets of legal rights associated with it: publishing rights and recording rights. Publishing rights refers to the rights of the songwriter (or the publishing company that now hold the rights). Recording rights refer to the rights of that specific recording/performance (usually held by the recording company).

> Example to illustrate the point:
>> Think of the [Auld Lang Syne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne) song.

>> The melody is an old Scottish folk song so ***no songwriter can claim publishing rights for it***. People all around the world can use the melody without having to obtain its publishing rights. In fact, it was used as the tune of the [SK national anthem for a few years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegukga).

>> Now imagine that some Singer X made a recording of a specific performance of the song Auld Lang Syne. This specific recording would have recording rights associated with it but no publishing rights associated with it. 

>> If someone wanted to use this recording made by Singer X in a drama as part of the soundtrack, they would need to license the *rights to use this particular recording* (recording rights). They would not need to obtain publishing rights since no songwriter/publishing company has those rights.


**Now for kdramas:**

The music used in kdramas can be one of three types:

> 1. Previously existing songs,

> 2. A specific recording of a previously existing song made just for the drama (such as a remake), or

> 3. A new song written and recorded specifically for the kdrama.


Of these three types, only types 2 and 3 are included in the kdrama’s OST (original soundtrack) because they were originally *created* for the kdrama.

And of these three types, only type 3 songs are easily licensed for worldwide distribution because both the publishing and recording rights are recently created and generally bundled together with the drama licensing rights.

For type 2 songs, while recording rights may be relatively easy to obtain since the recording was made specifically for the drama, publishing rights may be hard to obtain, especially for worldwide distribution.

For type 1 songs, both publishing and recording rights have to be obtained, making it even harder. Especially if the song is an existing kpop hit song whose international distribution rights are already held by different companies in different regions.


**Now why does Netflix often switch out songs:**

Because the songs switched out are often pre-existing songs that Netflix cannot (or has chosen not to) obtain international licensing rights for. Keep in mind that Netflix is available in ***a lot*** of markets internationally so if they want to license a song, they have to license it for every single market in which this drama will be streamed in. 

So if this drama will be streamed in 20 countries, then Netflix has to obtain song license rights in all 20 countries in order to use it, which can get ***really expensive*** really fast. For songs written and recorded specifically for dramas, licensing is feasible because the song rights are likely bundled with the drama streaming licensing rights, but is near impossible if the song is a pre-existing song with existing distribution deals in different markets. 

> A Hypothetical:

>> **Fire** by BTS was used as the intro song by a character in Fight My Way ([쌈 마이웨이](https://mydramalist.com/22472-fight-for-my-way)).

>> To stream the drama with this song in the USA, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Brazil, Netflix must obtain the licensing rights for this song in ***all five countries***. If Netflix cannot obtain the correct licensing rights for even ***one of these countries***, then the easiest way to deal with the problem is to switch the song out for some generic tune that they do have the rights for.

>> For a big act like BTS that definitely has different distribution deals in different markets, getting the licensing rights is probably a big challenge (and expense) and likely not worth it from a business standpoint for Netflix. The result is background music being replaced with generic tunes. 

And in case you were wondering, the music problem is not limited to kdrama content, see this [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7145231/shows-not-on-dvd-music-rights-wonder-years-wkrp) article explaining how music licensing rights are a huge headache for older shows now being released on streaming platforms.

I thought I was having a heart attack and tried to wait it out.  After twenty minutes or so it became apparent it wasn't going away and I wasn't able to drive at this point.  So I dialed 911 and told them I'm having chest pain, think it's a heart attack.  I could barely breathe or speak at this point.

Medics arrive and quickly determine it's not a cardiac issue and he can't hear anything on the left side with his stethoscope.  They mention pnuemothorax and I nod my head in agreement because I know what's next.  Queue the needle decompression and the hiss which gave me some relief during the ride to the emergency room.

Once at the emergency room, xrays showed fifty percent collapse of my left lung.  They put a chest tube in which I was awake for, that was pretty painful.  I was admitted that Friday and I've been here ever since.

I've been progressing really well, I don't need the nasal cannula and maintain good vitals.  Still have a pocket on the left side after about 6 hrs off suction.   So now I'm back on suction and another night.  It's almost 4am, it's tough to sleep although the meds help.

1kfyusf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyundai/comments/1kfyusf/2009_elantra_worth_keeping_for_senior_driver/,2009 Elantra Worth Keeping For Senior Driver?,"And when I say ""worth keeping"" I mean spending money on? I have no serious idea of things mechanical or older Hyundai's, but read conflicting opinions regarding them. I'm trying to help my father who is 77 years old with a nearly 20 year old car. He purchased the car new as a little commuter for his wife but when she passed eight years ago he kept it, and began driving it. He had retired upon her passing and sold his aging Cadillac around a year later. Too many problems, too big he said at the time. I still remember him telling me he was selling the Caddy, which came as a big surprise, and saying he liked ""scooting around town in the little go getter."" The Elantra was simple, didn't need repair, his daily commutes to work over. I understood. He did around thirty miles a day in it...four days a week, mostly highway....for two years. But for the last six years? It's just sat, really. Driven less than 100 miles a month I'd guess. Dad is strictly local these days but still healthy and independent. Called him a couple months ago and he mentioned the car. Needed tires badly he said, brakes felt squishy. He gets the oil changed around twice a year according to him but hasn't had it serviced since a year after his wife passed. So seven years ago. He says the timing belt was changed and all that goes with at the time. Spark plugs and wires, too. Also had the transmission serviced according to his records. Car was at 96K miles at the time, it's 117K now. The only repair it ever saw was a fuel pump under recall, and his wife took it to a local shop for service the years she drove it. Brakes, fluids, oil changes, that's it. Maybe belts? It got what it needed but didn't need much. It's a PZEV vehicle if that matters?

So...he wants to keep the car. Idk why as he can use uber for his appointments and trips to the senior center. And can walk to do errands and have coffee. He can have his groceries delivered but doesn't all the time. He drives to the market, mostly. Like a teenager he considers driving for himself being more independent and less dependent. He likes having a car. And thats ok. But at 77 years old its going to cost him nearly $3000 this year to keep the car on the road. And while thats fine I'm wondering if this near 20 year old car is about to become a money pit? He lives by his pension, has very modest savings, modest debt. But he had some losses and expenses that took a toll a couple decades ago and never fully recovered. So his pension, small savings, and the retirement community he lives in is all he has. He ""gets by fine"" as they say. But thats it. And he wants this silly car😉

The bill so far? Four new tires and brakes all around at $1300. The shop he took it to recommended a timing belt service based on age not on miles at $850, a new battery to replace the eight year old one at $260, transmission service and oil change at $230, and said the valve cover gasket has a small leak that will need attention at a cost of $170. So including the brakes and tires already done? $2800 total. They also notated spark plugs at $140 but said as long as the car is running well its optional. They are several years old, however.

So those of you ""in the know"" regarding this car? Is it solid enough at 117K miles for a guy like my father to spend money on to keep running reliably, or should I encourage him to sell it and call Senior Ride? I said ""dad do you really need a car?"" He paused and said ""No. But I want to keep it. I use it and might need it.""

Oh well...I just hope it can hold up for him. Or at least as long as he does...without further repair. What about its other systems and components. Reliable enough? Air Conditioner, radiator, electrical things and fuel system? Is trouble looming? Dad's Caddy was problem after problem it seemed. 100 miles a month give or take isn't much to ask.

1kfytaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1kfytaj/is_drinking_coffee_a_necessity_in_a_world_filled/,Is drinking coffee a necessity in a world filled with coffee drinkers?,"I've been a notorious non-stimulants (caffeine etc.) beverage drinker for my entire life, and it starts to feel like a disadvantage the longer I continue with this.

It seems like everyone around me is energized, productive 24/7, and I've always wondered ""where do you even get the energy from?"". Like it didn't get sense to me to have energy all the time. I am productive myself, but only when I have the energy. I don't ""force"" productivity out of nowhere, you understand?

However, as I get older, the further I progress in university, this approach of ""waiting for productivity"" doesn't seem to work anymore. People *expect* productivity. From morning, till evening. They don't support your desire to not force productivity, they don't understand you can be productive *when you are*, they just tell you ""Be productive whenever *I* want you to be"". And that's when I encounter a problem: I can't be productive if *someone else* tries to force it, even though I do not have the energy right now.

What solves this problem, which is why I think the world is how it is? Coffee. Energy drinks. Coke. Black tea. Substances with caffeine. People don't force themselves to be productive, they try to be productive because *someone else* expects it from them. So they drink coffee, from morning, till evening.

I've tried drinking coffee from morning till evening, and see there, I was productive from morning, till evening.

It seriously feels like by not drinking beverages with caffeine, in a world of caffeine drinkers, I put myself at disadvantages. I'm seriously thinking about drinking caffeine *for others* now, because *everyone else* drinks coffee. What else am I supposed to do, be tired and then say ""Nah. Will be productive in 2 hours again"" when my boss is a 24/7 energized person?

I want to find the person who thought it's a good idea to force productivity, not to *embrace* productivity. I don't have a problem with drinking coffee from morning, till evening. It just seems strange. But I have encountered many strange in my life, it's just another one.

They’re short, friendly, and super practical. Save them. Practice them. Use them in the wild 👇



* Moi! – Hi!

Simple, cheerful, and used by everyone. You’ll hear this more than your own name

* Kiitos! – Thank you

Politeness matters. This one’s a keeper

* Anteeksi – Sorry / Excuse me

Bump into someone? Drop your phone on the metro? This word saves the day

* En puhu suomea. – I don’t speak Finnish.

No shame in it, just honesty. And locals appreciate that

* Puhutko englantia? – Do you speak English?

Most Finns do. But asking politely never hurts

* Missä on vessa? – Where is the bathroom?

It’s essential knowledge

* Yksi kahvi, kiitos. – One coffee, please.

Trust us, you’ll use this a lot. Finland runs on caffeine

* Kuinka paljon tämä maksaa? – How much does this cost?

Great for markets, cafés, or when IKEA suddenly becomes your second home

* Voinko maksaa kortilla? – Can I pay by card?

Hint: almost everything is contactless in Finland. But still good to ask

* Hauska tutustua! – Nice to meet you!

1kfypb2,https://i.redd.it/pn1cl5xb74ze1.png,Thoughts on Funk It?,"I am just wondering what people's opinions/thoughts are on the coffee & thrift shop that opened in the Northside neighborhood this last summer, Funk It.
 
I live close by and was initially very excited when I heard news of the place opening & they seem to have great reviews but... I just don't get it. I'm not a coffee drinker but my fiance & best friend are & they say the coffee is awful. The chai is okay, the matcha is grainy & muddy in color, & both the London fog & Italian cream soda were flavorless. I attributed this to growing pains & have since given the drinks more chances but they seem to have not improved. I will say, I once tried a pea flower tea lemonade there that was FANTASTIC & the food/pastries are pretty good.
The thrift is okay. I've gotten a few cute pieces there. Besides that though, it's lack luster for the most part, ESPECIALLY the men's section. I don't know if it's because it's getting ran through or what.
The furnishings & decor are very well done & cozy. 
I've for the most part avoided the place but what prompted me to post was learning that the owners aren't very interested in collaborating with specifically Northside businesses. This is a huge bummer because I believe we have a really cool neighborhood community that helps each other out. I won't name names, I really don't want to start beef, just want to start a conversation with other Missoulans.
I do give them props for collaborating with other Missoula businesses & I would consider Draught Works Northside.
I really do wish the best for Funk It, the owners, & staff. I just can't help but feel a sense of ingenuity, like Funk It is a ""vibe"" novelty shop that appeals to out-of-staters that move to Missoula rather than the community that is already established specifically in the Northside.

1kfyp29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fat2Fit/comments/1kfyp29/bai_drinks_weight_loss_lie_i_tried_it_for_30_days/,Bai Drinks: Weight Loss Lie?! I Tried It For 30 Days...,"Introduction
------------

Many people want to lose weight. They see ""Bai"" drinks at the store. Bai says it is a healthy drink. Bai says it has only five calories. But does Bai *really* help with weight loss? Maybe not. Some drinks are not good for health.

This writing will look at Bai. I will check if Bai helps with weight loss. I will write about what is inside Bai. Also, I will say if Bai is good or bad for you. Now, what does it do inside your stomach?

Understanding Bai Drinks: What Are They?
----------------------------------------

Bai is one type of drink you can get in market. Bai sell many types of drinks. Some Bai drinks say ""antioxidant infusion"". That mean it may be healthy, I hope. Bai puts in things like coffeefruit extract. I think it comes from coffee.

Bai add sweeteners too. They say Bai has ""5 calories, 1 gram of sugar."" I need to check if that right. Because of that many people ask the main question “is bai good for weight loss”. Weight loss can be hard for some.

Bai and Weight Loss: The Calorie and Sugar Connection
-----------------------------------------------------

### How Low Calories Can Support Weight Loss

Bai drinks do not have many calories. Other drinks have too many calories. Soda has many calories. Juice has many calories. When someone eats too many calories, that someone might gain weight. If someone drinks Bai instead, that someone eats fewer calories. I know this can help for weight loss. Some say low calorie drinks for weight loss is good.

### The Role of Sugar in Weight Management and the Impact of Bai's Sweeteners

Sugar is not good when try to lose weight. Too much sugar means gain weight. Bai uses sweeteners. Some sweeteners are erythritol and stevia. Bai may have stevia. These sweeteners add sweet. These sweeteners are not sugar, but some sweeteners still maybe not good. These sweeteners may change blood sugar. If you have blood problems, I hope you take the drink after advice from doctor.

Exploring the Potential Benefits of Bai Drinks
----------------------------------------------

### Antioxidant Power: How Bai's Ingredients Contribute to Overall Health

Bai drinks have good things inside. Coffeefruit extract is in Bai. I read that have antioxidants. Antioxidants may help your body. Antioxidants fight bad things inside. So Bai drinks may help in small amount, they say. Bai drinks do not hurt, they say. It is good, but maybe not for weight loss.

Potential Drawbacks and Side Effects of Bai
-------------------------------------------

### The Downside of Artificial Sweeteners

Bai has sweeteners. Sweeteners make it taste good. But some people have problem from it. I read artificial sweeteners may give stomach issues. Maybe gas. Maybe bloating. Some people feel bad after. I do not like this problem. It depend on the body. I do not drink too much.

### Overconsumption and Hidden Calories

Bai drinks say low calories, but do not drink too many. Many Bai drinks can add up. Still have calories. Bai not same as water. Always drink water. Water is the best. Water is very important. Water, exercise and less stress are very important for weight loss.

Bai vs. Other Drinks: A Comparative Analysis
--------------------------------------------

### Bai vs. Sugary Sodas and Juices

Soda is not good for you. Juice can have much sugar too. Bai has less sugar. Bai has less calories than soda and juice. I think Bai is good instead. But Bai can be not good if drink it all time. Everything needs be small.

### Bai vs. Water and Unsweetened Drinks

Water is the best thing to drink. Water has zero calories. Water is good for you. Bai is good if you want some taste. Bai can give some flavor. Some people do not like plain water. I know plain water helps very much. I like plain water.

How to Incorporate Bai Into a Weight Loss Plan
----------------------------------------------

You can drink Bai if want. But do not drink only Bai. Eat good food. Eat fruits and vegetables. Exercise is good. Bai can change soda. Bai can help drink more liquid. Do not drink too many. Not too much Bai.

Conclusion
----------

Bai can be okay for weight loss. Bai not a magic tool. Bai not help for everything. Do not drink all time. Eat less. Exercise all time. The Bai drinks and weight loss process will go hand in hand if followed correctly.

Talk to doctor is good idea. Doctor knows your body. Doctor can help you lose weight. Do not only trust Bai. Good luck to you.

1kfym9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/itsgettinglate/comments/1kfym9k/i_may_have_noticed_something_significant_about/,I may have noticed something significant about the connections between everything.,"There have been a few different things we've seen that are clearly meaningful, but nobody's been sure how. The big two are when Mr. Pickles breaks character in ""$$$ ORDER YOUR VERY OWN BRINE.... TODAY!!!!"" and says ""I don't like to call it trauma, it's just a bad memory"" and when in the video ""3. ....more coffee?"" the snow suddenly starts falling up near the end.

Now, I could be off here, but one of the big motifs of the project/story seems to be time, memory, and reminiscence. We get that in a pretty big way with the narrator talking about his past in the first video, the idea of ""forgetting"", and the midnight riddle, which I'm really starting to think the solution for is ""trauma"" or something like it. We've also seen a lot of talk about the fourth dimension, especially in the code that translated to ""4D SECURITY BREACH"". My general understanding of how dimensions work is that time could be considered a fourth dimension, just one that we can only more through in one direction as opposed to the other 3.

Now, if there's a 4D security breach, wouldn't that imply time travel? Or time reversal? Which could look like, for example, a sudden reversal in the flow of the natural world, including snow? Maybe it would look like somebody who was previously acting perfectly normal freaking out as if they know that something bad is about to happen... just like the man does in ch. 7, the Midnight Riddle Hour.

And on the note of memory, Mr. Pickles explicitly brings up trauma in his debut appearance. Brine is a solution used to preserve something, just like how we preserve our trauma. Mr. Pickles is even shown to be abusive to his subordinates in the latest video (Ch. 7), which would certainly be a source of trauma. And trauma is something that grows worse if we keep feeding it our energy and attention... ""if you feed it, it will grow."" It creeps into every aspect of our lives, like a company acquiring everything it can for the sake of growth and nothing more. Like Feeder Tech.

To name a few theories I can't quite make fit perfectly yet:  
\- Log cabin probably isn't actually just a way to start a fire. The narrator finds a strange house in the very first chapter where he plays the tape, and the first puzzle on the website ended with us getting a picture of what appeared to be a log cabin. I think maybe something happened at a log cabin in the past that we aren't hearing about, at least not yet.  
\- The anomaly and disappearances must have some symbolic significance too besides their actual literal importance if my theory is correct. Maybe that's what happens when you're forgotten? A forgotten car is lost, a dog whose owner loses track of her vanishes, an absentee father vanishes for real?  
\- Reaching spaces... I have no idea. Maybe they're in opposition to Feeder Tech? It seems like their messaging sometimes reaches us by interrupting feeder tech ads, and the idea of ""4D Ascension"" makes me wonder if they're offering a way to move past your trauma keeping you stuck in a time loop of sorts and live your life, or a chance to go back and resolve your trauma.  
\- The hail might be a representation of the mind refusing to let you move on, the inside of your head is a hostile environment or something like that. But it's really not clear.  
\- I have absolutely no idea that the hell is going on in ""¿"". Can't make that one make sense whatsoever. Also no idea what's been going on on the websites, what the post-apocalyptic world is meant to be, the significance of the theme of apocalypse/absurdity in the website and (seemingly) the books that the ISBN code puzzle leads to. It's gotta be something for sure, but I haven't got a clue what.

So... what does that all mean? Honestly, I don't really know. But it seems way too well-supported to just be written off. And I feel like there are probably more connections that I'm just not seeing yet. Let me know what you guys think, though! I feel like this is a surprisingly strong theory that I kept having an inkling might be something worth looking in to, but never realized how much there was to it until I stopped to write it all down. This was actually meant to be a much shorter post, but the more I wrote the more I noticed.

1kfyhey,https://www.reddit.com/r/I_DONT_LIKE/comments/1kfyhey/i_dont_like_how_everything_is_emotionally/,I don’t like how everything is emotionally choreographed these days,"In the streaming era—especially with TikTok—every moment has to come with a soundtrack. Every video, no matter how mundane, is scored like a movie scene. A cup of coffee becomes “cozy.” A street view becomes “nostalgic.” A random dog running becomes “emotional support.”

It’s not that emotions are bad. But this constant emotional packaging feels artificial to me. I don’t like being told how I’m *supposed* to feel. I don’t want my feelings to be pre-programmed by background music, filters, and timed cuts.

Sometimes a moment is just a moment. It doesn’t need music. It doesn’t need to be aesthetic. It can just *be*.

But I'm fairly certain I have some kind of issue with gluten and I've not had much help from my doctor in figuring it out. I feel like he doesn't take my symptoms seriously. 

Often after eating I will experience some combination of symptoms like fatigue, stomach cramps, loose stools/diarrhea, acid reflux, difficulty speaking (chest feels heavy and talking feels extremely exhausting, not sure how else to explain it).

Ever since I cut out gluten about six or seven months ago, almost all of these symptoms have disappeared. I'm no longer bloated after every meal and only when I accidentally eat something with gluten do I feel any discomfort. My poops have been the most normal in decades. I had no idea every poop could be solid and require minimal wipes! 

Anyway, my question is, is there any other gluten condition that I might have? I'm not even 100% certain gluten is the only issue, it's possible things that contain gluten often contain something else that is my trigger. I have some trouble drinking coffee still, it gives me an upset stomach. 

Just looking for some direction if anyone has had a similar experience. Also is it possible I'm celiac in like an early stage that doesn't show up on tests? 

Sorry if I'm being confusing, I'm just confused.

It's a day to reset & prepare for the week ahead, both my home life and for the upcoming floral life. With Mother's Day quickly approaching, I decided  today I   take it slower,  drinking my coffee this morning while doing some journaling,  some much overdue banking admin, and then I decided to go out for a walk and do a little Floral forging. Here in Vancouver this spring is bringing all of our greenery to life, there is colour everywhere. A short walk on a friends property led me to some beautiful lilacs, Lily of the Valley, and stunning, flowering fruit trees.

Afterwards, I brought them home, and designed for myself,  bouquets in honour of my mother (from the lilacs) and my stepmother (the bridal bouquet I made for her when she married my dad was made of Lily of the valley). So much of what I design is for a purpose, for others, is rarely for me. Today I let the flowers and my hands work together.

And then this evening, I sat down with my adult son and we  planned our upcoming road trip to Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. As a West Coast girl, my heart is always happiest when I am by on or in the ocean. I'm very much looking forward to getting to know another part of my beautiful country and experiencing the Atlantic Ocean in all of its glory.

Self-care today was about the little moments of joy, those that are present right now, and planning for those that I will experience in a few weeks.

One of them seemed to be a little nicer and we’d have long convos at the office but Ive asked her twice to get coffee together and she had excuses both times. 

Initially, I was in denial and gave a hundred excuses but it kinda feels like I’m gaslighting myself at this point. Lol.

Are you wondering what exactly happens during a deep cleaning service? At Oh Yes Home Cleaning Service, our basic[ deep cleaning](https://ohyesworld.com/) package goes far beyond regular maintenance cleaning to restore your home to a pristine condition. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what our deep cleaning services include:

# Our Basic Deep Cleaning Service Checklist

# Kitchen Deep Cleaning Service

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, but it’s also one of the areas that accumulates the most dirt, grease, and bacteria. Our house deep cleaning service pays special attention to this crucial space:

* **Appliance Exterior & Interior Cleaning**: We clean inside and outside of microwaves, ovens, refrigerators, removing food residue, grease buildup, and sanitizing surfaces.
* **Cabinet Cleaning**: All cabinet exteriors are wiped down, with special attention to handles and edges where grease builds up. Interior organization is available upon request.
* **Countertop & Backsplash Sanitization**: We thoroughly clean and sanitize all countertop surfaces and backsplashes, removing food particles, stains, and bacteria.
* **Sink Deep Cleaning**: Our certified cleaning professionals scrub and sanitize the sink basin, faucet, and drain area, removing mineral deposits and food residue.
* **Floor Deep Cleaning**: We mop and sanitize floors, paying special attention to corners and areas under appliances where crumbs and spills often hide.
* **Small Appliance Cleaning**: Toasters, coffee makers, blenders, and other small appliances are wiped down and sanitized.
* **Range Hood Degreasing**: We remove grease buildup from range hoods, filters, and exhaust fans that often collect cooking residue.
* **Drawer & Shelf Cleaning**: Drawers and shelves are emptied (upon request), wiped down, and sanitized before items are neatly replaced.

# Bathroom Deep Cleaning

Bathrooms require special attention during deep cleaning due to moisture, soap scum, and potential mold issues. Our detailed cleaning service tackles these areas thoroughly:

* **Shower & Bathtub Scrubbing**: We remove soap scum, water stains, and mildew from shower walls, doors, bathtubs, and fixtures until they shine like new.
* **Toilet Sanitization**: Every part of the toilet is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, including the base, tank, seat, and surrounding floor area.
* **Sink & Vanity Cleaning**: We clean and polish sinks, faucets, and vanity areas, removing toothpaste splatter, makeup residue, and water spots.
* **Mirror & Glass Polishing**: All mirrors and glass surfaces are cleaned to a streak-free shine using professional-grade glass cleaners.
* **Tile & Grout Deep Cleaning**: Our specialized cleaning methods remove dirt and discoloration from tile surfaces and grout lines, restoring their original appearance.
* **Cabinet & Drawer Organization**: Bathroom cabinets and drawers are wiped down inside and out, with contents neatly organized upon request.
* **Floor Sanitization**: Bathroom floors are thoroughly cleaned, removing hair, dust, and sanitizing to eliminate bacteria in this high-moisture area.
* **Exhaust Fan Dusting**: Often neglected but important for preventing mold, exhaust fans are carefully cleaned to remove dust buildup.

# Living Areas & Bedrooms

Creating a clean, comfortable environment in your living and sleeping spaces is essential for a truly clean home. Our whole house cleaning approach includes:

* **Furniture Cleaning**: We vacuum upholstery, clean under cushions, and wipe down all wooden furniture surfaces, removing dust and stains.
* **Ceiling Fan & Light Fixture Dusting**: Our team reaches high areas to clean ceiling fans, light fixtures, and remove cobwebs from corners and ceilings.
* **Baseboards & Crown Molding**: These often-neglected areas are wiped clean of accumulated dust and dirt that regular cleaning misses.
* **Window Sills & Tracks**: Window sills, tracks, and blinds are thoroughly cleaned to remove dust, insects, and debris that builds up over time.
* **Door Cleaning**: Door surfaces, handles, and frames are wiped down and sanitized, focusing on high-touch areas that harbor germs.
* **Under Furniture Cleaning**: We move furniture (where possible) to clean underneath, reaching areas that are typically overlooked during routine cleaning.
* **Picture Frames & Décor Dusting**: Decorative items, picture frames, and shelving are carefully dusted and cleaned without disturbing your arrangement.
* **Carpet & Rug Deep Cleaning**: Beyond vacuuming, we treat stains and high-traffic areas on carpets and rugs to revitalize their appearance.

# Additional Areas

Our deep cleaning service extends beyond the main living spaces to ensure a comprehensive cleaning experience:

* **Hallway & Entryway**: These high-traffic areas receive thorough attention, with floors cleaned, walls spot-cleaned, and fixtures dusted.
* **Staircase Cleaning**: Each step is vacuumed and wiped down, with handrails sanitized and spindles dusted to remove accumulated dirt.

1kfyb6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1kfyb6f/so_no_one_knows_macros_ratio/,So no one knows macros ratio?,"There is so much information about everything, but I can't seem to find something as simple as recommended macros without finding mixed or opposite advices or just ""watch out for this, watch out for that"" warnings without actually presenting an example of a mealplan for one day. I've been even chatting with ChatGPT which is actually very helpful for some things, though I have to be careful to rethink everything. I'm not sure 50% of macros (90g+) should be fats?  
Is that really okay? And if not, what to eat then? 

I don't have prediabetes (yet) but I do have IR. I don't want to lose weight. I thrive on sugar (carbs that taste sweet), I feel amazing, I don't feel bad after eating them at any point later in the day, I feel good all day, I get energy, mood lift, I think better and I want to dance,  so I cannot rely on these feelings (adrenaline probably and basically too much of a response), I have to reprogram myself. I also love eggs for example and it's absoultely not a problem for me to eat them, but GPT casually putting 4 eggs into one day might not be sustainable.

Yes, I've been to doctors, dietitians too, everyone is nice but at the end of the day it's kind of useless.

I've also started eating meat after 15 years (and stopped drinking coffee) and (probably when I was intentionally gaining weight in the last year) my cholesterol got worse than usual (and I didn't have problems with it before). That being said, right now I can't imagine what would I eat without meat (more or less just chicken/turkey though). Fried foods - I never cared for them. Even non-sweet carbs - I never cared for them and I don't care if I don't eat any kind of pasta ever again. My main motivation right now is obviously not to get diabetes and also be able to eat sweets at parties for the price of not eating them regularly.

My favourite food in the world is tomato but I abandoned it because of some reflux problems in the summer (though I'm not sure it's the problem but I'm playing safe also with spicy food and some nuts (which I also love) which leaves even less room). Luckily for me I've always kind of liked ""bland"" food but sauces and such might help me get through sugar reduction. 

Do you have any macros suggestions? 

I'm pretty sure that if I reduce calories too I will have the second problem, while  just detoxing from sugar is hard enough. Actually I wouldn't mind losing 1 or 2kgs but not more so I'm not focusing on that and would like a ""maintaining"" mealplan. (1600-2000 calories (depends on exercise), even 1600 mealplan would be great .....yesterday I put stuff in the cronometer app....but I'm really not sure I should eat that much fat. But I have to eat *something* ....",2,1746515143.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False
1kfyaa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kfyaa6/leaving_behind_whats_important_to_remember/,Leaving behind whats important to remember,"Hi Reddit! 

What you're about to read is my past, that I want to leave behind me. I do not wish to forget it, I won't be able to. But I don't want to keep holding onto so much baggage. I want to save my Memories somewhere, so that I can allow myself to move on properly.

As a reminder for myself, in moments of weakness in which I think to myself: “maybe i should forgive. She is still my mother after all.” I can come back to this Post and remind myself of all the things she did to her own Daughter. 



My Mother was a fierce single mom with an all day office job when i was little, she worked tirelessly until she suffered from a slipped disk, which forced her to retire early due to the pain (she was around 40 back then)



This left her basically stranded at home, sitting hurts, lying down hurts, standing hurts. This caused her personality to change, the loving and caring mother I knew became somewhat cold towards me. When I got into middle school, I got bullied due to being overweight. Additionally I didn't have any Friends, so I spent most of my free time at home. My mother also had few to no friends, so we were at home almost every day. 

Despite my many efforts to spend time together she refused and told me to back off because I was too much. So I kept to myself a lot, drawing and playing Video Games in my Room.



Ever since I got bullied I cried almost every Night, I always felt like I was disappointing her, not good enough of a daughter. I had so much hatred in me, but I was never really angry at her, just disappointed in myself.

This went on for a few years, until I went to highschool, she advised me to not tell ANYONE that i was bullied before because that would make me a target, so i kept quiet and eventually found a group of friends! I was beyond excited and wanted to do as many after-school-friendship-activities as I could! So I asked my mother if I could hang out with them.

This brought up her usual questions/rules, which i had to answer going forward, EVERY TIME i wanted to do smth after school:

* Where are you going?

* Who's going with you?
* Do I know them?
* (if at a friend's house) is a parent present?
* Do I know their parents?
* house address and phone number of the present parent?
* be home before 8!



alright fine. This was probably all for the sake of my safety, but having to ask my mommy for permission to go to a mall with friends, at the age of 16 got annoying fairly quickly. I noticed all my other friends just “informed” their parents, and they were good to go. If i was at a friends house for the first time and got back home, i also always got the same questions:

* Were the Parents at home?
* Do they live in a Flat or a house?
* Do they own it or is it rented? 
* Was their home prettier than ours? 



When i met my first Boyfriend, i excitedly told her about him, she listened and then went ahead with her safety questions:

* Does he go to school? - yes
* Does he smoke? - no
* Does he have a driver's license? - no
* Did you already have Sex?! - no



I was fine with them, since I assumed she just wanted to make sure I was safe and not dating a dodgy guy. She told me to invite him over to our place (which is rare because she hates having people over) so I did. I expected nothing much, we were freshly in love and too shy to do anything intimate yet, so it felt sort of like a Playdate. The two of us played Smash on my WiiU, when she came in and asked us to come eat. She had prepared some snacks and drinks in the living room and told my BF to sit down. And she started questioning him! She had her legs crossed and hands folded,it felt like an interrogation. I wouldn't dare speak against her, so all I could do is sit and watch in silence.

This took over an hour. Afterwards he had to go and I apologized for my moms behaviour, but luckily he didn't.



After a few months of dating, and a few sleepovers at his place, I also wanted to ”just inform” her about my Plans. Usually I asked her in advance if I could stay at his place and it was never an issue. So, that day after school I texted her, I wrote that i'm with my bf, we will be at his place playing games, yes his mother will be home, yes i will do my homework and regularly go to school the next day, and after school i will come straight home. I didn't get an answer, but the messenger we used informed me that she had opened and read the message, so I went ahead with my plans.



I came home the next day to my room being torn apart. My plushies had been thrown around, the drawings I had put on the wall to display were torn to shreds and on the ground, all my electronics (DS, WiiU, Laptop) had all been confiscated and I had to give her my Phone.

I cried when I saw my room and asked her why she would do that to me??? She told me that she couldn't control her anger and sadness because she “didn't know where I was”. After informing her that I texted her, she said that she didn't see it, that anyone could have written that and I could've been god knows where.



This started the downward spiral of our Mother-daughter relationship. Every time I did something wrong she turned off the Wifi. I was too loud while gaming? No Wifi.

I brought home a bad grade? No Wifi. I forgot to take out the trash? You guessed it! No Wifi!

Which always happened while I was in a Match and a Call with online friends. This became sort of a meme among us, if i didn't move or talk anymore, my mother was at it again.



Soon after she started giving me chores; walking the dog at least an hour every day and before going to school, taking out the trash when full, and doing my own Laundry. I did them all poorly, I'll be honest. I did not really care for long walks with our dog, since we got him to encourage HER to walk more in the first place. The morning walks were horrible for me, since it took me an hour to get to school and I hate waking up early.I repeatedly told her that i don't want to do the morning walks, when she is at home and sleeps until 2pm every day.

And i just didn't notice the other chores, before she deemed it being “too late” and i got my usual punishment.

Honorable mentions of other things she said and did:



* “what happens at home STAYS at home. The people don't have to know everything that's going on here! And don't you dare talk bad about me to your friends at school. They won't last, I'm your mother, I'll always be here.”
* canceled my sweet 16 birthday party that my Best friend had already planned out and that was approved of by her, because I failed a class. She made me stay at home alone with her. My gift was a gym bag with the writing “shit happens” on it.
* told me to cook my own food and to stop “stealing” hers. When I asked for money to go buy ingredients she told me that if I wanted food, I'd have to get a job. Besides, even if I got anything, I wasn't allowed to cook in her kitchen. 
* i once made her breakfast as a surprise on mother's day, she told me to let it be, and she wants love and attention every day, not just on a forced occasions.
* i cried very often, her response to this was: “There must be something wrong with you! Maybe you should go see a psychiatrist!” not as an offer but as a way to shame me.
* when yelling at her that i thought about throwing myself in front of a train lately, she told me that i'm nothing special and that she thought about it many times herself.
* accused me of being a “tyrant”, because she is “locked at home” since I'm out after school so much and can't look after the dog if she were to go out.
* repeatedly told me that if i didn't like living with her, i could always just go to my dad! (he was always portrayed by her, as an evil man who left us and doesn't really love me)
* She called herself “Lion Mama” because she will always fiercely protect me.
* Another go to punishment was the silent treatment. She would talk to me the day before and after I came home from school she wouldnt look or speak to me anymore, like I did not exist.
* After consulting with the city's “youth welfare services” (I guess smth similar to CPS) and telling them about my situation I got a written letter that I was supposed to hand her, but when I did, she told me that “I can also use photoshop!” and threw it away. 
* After realising the letter was real she scolded me for ruining her life and reputation.
* kept telling me over and over that i should change “my behaviour” towards her and that i am being ungrateful and disrespectful. When asking what behaviour exactly she meant, i was told that “you know EXACTLY what I mean”.  to this day i don't.
* “if i had known my child would turn out to be like this, i never would've had one”
* kept saying how excited she is for me to turn 18 because then i won't be her problem anymore and that she wants me out of the house. She said this every other day after I turned 17.



I was afraid of being kicked out! She told me that no one will tolerate my behaviour and that she doesn't care if I end up under a bridge. 

So I started looking for Saturday Jobs, and dirt cheap flats that I could afford, but I found nothing suitable.

I caved in and called my Dad. We didn't have a close relationship at all, but he's my Knight in not so shiny armor. He brought me a Wifi cube so I could be “immune” to her usual punishment, and helped me move out on my 18th birthday (along with some friends). I'm really grateful to my Dad, he basically moved out of his own apartment to let me move in, he left the flat completely furnished and full of everything i could need.



This of course upset my mother, she kept texting me, I kept largely ignoring her due to suddenly living alone, having to manage chores, cook for myself and still attending and finishing school.



Eventually she emailed me that we should meet up and talk about legal and document stuff, since I've now moved out. I offered to meet her in a public place and so we settled on a cafe in a mall close to her. I had mentally prepared myself to talk about facts and ignore any sort of manipulation,guilt tripping or Gaslighting from her. It went well in the beginning, she focused on what she needed from me and what sort of steps I needed to take, but after discussing family bonus she lost it.

Mom:  “I need this from your school so that i can continue getting the family support money”

Me: “But that's money for me. U get this money to support your child. I will not let you have the money that is intended for me”

She then proceeded to list me all of her usual bullet points: “if you had just changed your behaviour we wouldn't be in this situation, stop this rebellious phase and come home already!” She said that this was all a huge mistake, that she knows I have nowhere to go and to stop being a “rebellious teenager”. She talked about how much she Pity's my boyfriends, and where we put all my stuff (she assumed I moved in with him and his mom).

I asked her, “What am I supposed to take from this conversation?”

she kept saying the same stuff over and over and I kept asking “What am I supposed to take from this conversation?” In the end she got frustrated, stood up and said: “you can pay for your own coffee!” She then went to the front, paid and left.

I was shocked, she never acted this way, i went to the desk to pay and while walking out of the mall noticed how my body and voice trembled, i then started crying on my way out.



My new BF (last one broke up with me shortly after the Move) noticed that every time she texts me, I'm down and sad for the rest of the day, and advised me to block her. I was hesitant at first because she's still my mother after all, but he insisted. So I did. I blocked her on every social, every messenger, even emails.

That doesn't mean that she left me alone. Oh no, she stalked me. She figured out where I live, where my BF lives, who his Mother is, what her phone number is and CALLED HER. My Mother called my Boyfriend's Mom to tell her that she shouldn't believe everything I say, that I'm a chronic liar and other stuff she didn't want to repeat to me.

I was terrified! What if she came here, or to my flat?! 



I Began having Nightmares of my Mother standing in my Living Room, or in my Doorway. Just being there and pretending like nothing happened. Just her presence scared me.



One time, she tried taking money out of my account and giving it to herself! (IDK how, but she managed to keep my bank account as a teen account, meaning she could still access and monitor it) luckily i was able to contact my Bank and open a new account. 

I'm assuming this is also how she found my BF, i probably sent him some money sometime and that way she had a name. His mom has a private clinic so googling her wasn't very hard.

She keeps sending me emails from time to time, telling me how much she misses me, that not everything was bad and that we could start new and become friends.

I don't want to. I'm happy. I am turning 23 soon! I found this happiness all by myself! The Love of my Life and I have been together for 5 years now, he has helped me unlearn stuff, supported me throughout all these new adult challenges, helped me overcome trauma i didn't even know i had, and is just overall showing me the world gentle parenting style. I started a new Job last year, was able to move into a new flat together with my BF and I couldn't be happier.



I will always miss my Mom. Not her, but the Mother who cared for me with so much Love while I was still a child, and she wasn't sick. All I ever wanted was an apology. I may have been difficult, but I did not deserve the way I was treated.   
  


And if you happen to find and read this Mom: never contact me again. I have built a happy life for myself and i intend to keep it that way.",3,1746515045.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

As she stood outside the CEO’s office, Beatrice Lawson felt like she couldn’t breathe, the air around her becoming thinner and thinner.

Desmond answered, his deep voice almost a growl.

Flames of anger were still burning inside her before she entered.

1kfy99z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1kfy99z/dating_or_just_hanging_out/,Dating or just hanging out?,"In 2020, I read an article and talked to friends about how many people had started having extremely vivid dreams, due to pandemic stress. I've always remembered feelings or small parts of my dreams, but they used to fade from my memory pretty quickly. Since 2020, I have been having dreams that I remember better than I remember what I ate yesterday. It seems like they just keep getting more clear and realistic.

Last night I had a dream that I was in high school or college and one of the people in my friend circle just happened to be Brett Goldstein(the actor who played Roy Kent in Ted Lasso). He wasn't an actor, just a popular, well liked fellow student. At his invitation, he and I started having frequent dates, usually at a movie theater. He called them dates as in, ""would you like to go on a date with me tomorrow?"" 

He seemed like a nice, interesting person who I would like to get to know, so I agreed. Plus, I love movies and going to the movie theater. He proved to be a very kind and thoughtful person, often bringing along his friends who were lonely or kids with special needs as he was in some kind of Big Brother program. This was a lovely surprise at first, because I have a nephew with physical and learning disabilities and anyone I date would have to be understanding of certain behaviors and limitations. 

We'd been going on a couple of ""dates"" a week, but we never end up being able to watch an entire movie, it's never just the two of us, and we are only ever in the theater, where we can't talk. I start feeling weird about everything. I love a movie date, but I'm used to hanging out, having a meal, or at least coffee together afterwards so we have a chance to talk. I realized that after we'd been going on these ""dates"" for months, I didn't really know anything about him and we'd never really had a conversation. 

I started feeling very anxious and feeling like I had deeply misunderstood something. Normally, to me, dating for that long, seeing each other so often, and having standing plans would mean we were boyfriend and girlfriend, but we had never kissed, held hands, or even had a real conversation still. I started wondering if we were hanging out as friends and not actually dating. I must have totally misunderstood him, and he must have been using the word ""date"" as in a plan, like, ""it's a date."" My anxiety was eating me up and I felt so foolish for probably being way too flirty with someone who thought of me as a friend. 

He was so kind and thoughtful, but this seemed to be a huge blindspot for him. I was perfectly fine having a movie-watching friend OR dating, I just wanted to know exactly what was going on. I was worried about offending him by asking, because in the dream, that would have been a huge and horrible faux pas. By the dream logic, it would have literally been the worst thing in the world, as I would have not only deeply offended him, but he would also see how dumb I was for not understanding his intentions from the start.

I finally worked up the courage to ask him whether we were dating romantically or if we were(platonic) best movie buddies. 

And then I woke up. 

I often end up waking up with feelings of anxiety, frustration, or an overwhelming sense of something ominous, not just from whatever happens in the dream, but also from not getting a resolution. I don't think my dreams have ever had resolutions, but when they faded away quickly, I barely remembered the dream at all so it was easy to stop thinking about. ",1,1746514922.0,Dream,0,1.0,False

I follow the process and it was very smooth. I had my initial interview and versant assessment completed and I passed. I was profiled to a Credit Specialist Role and to be honest I don't have any idea about it. The recruiter called me and told me congratulations!

I went home but I did not receive any call from the recruitment that day so I sent an email to follow up with them the next day. I received a response and they told me that they did try reaching me but my number cannot be reached. ""I wonder why because I have my phone with me all the time at home waiting for the call."" But anyway, she called me right away when I gave her my alternative contact number. She scheduled me an interview within that week. I was so happy about it. However, on the day of the said interview I received another call from the recruitment about the changes since the hiring leader won't be able to make it due to some important meetings. So I was rescheduled the next Monday then and was hoping that there will be no more changes. Luckily my final interview commenced on Monday evening 9pm and I was the only applicant in there career center. I arrived 7:45pm and I was too early hahaha. I waited for over an hour and had a chitchat with kuya guard and he even offer me a free coffee. It was nice though and I enjoyed it. And when the time comes, I was so lucky enough that the hiring leader who interviewed me was so nice and she really make sure that I am comfortable. She's very conversational and she always smile at me and even cracked a joke. I feel like I was not in an interview setting, I feel like I'm just talking to a friend. Even if she asks me many questions, it was not hard for me to answer those questions. She even shared about how the LOB works and those KPI's.

The living room is often considered the heart of the home, serving as a gathering place for family and friends.

In this article, we present 25 inspiring red living room decor ideas that will help you elevate your space to new heights.

Select pillows in different fabrics and patterns (think florals, stripes, and solids) to create visual interest.

A red sofa can serve as the centerpiece of your living room. Its boldness demands attention and can be paired with contrasting colors for balance.

1kfy294,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kfy294/how_is_the_correct_medication_supposed_to_workfeel/,How is the correct medication supposed to work/feel?,"Hi all!

I was diagnosed with ASD and later ADHD (combination type, if that is of importance) about 5 years ago, I am 26 years old right now. At first I tried brandless ritalin (fast release methylphenidate) at 5mg 4 times a day but I soon stopped taking it because it took away the little appetite I had, making me stop eating, and because I couldn't keep up with the routine (irony!). Later I started taking brandless concerta (long release methylphenidate) at 36mg once a day, it's still the current medication I have available to me.

My question is the following: what effect does ADHD medication need to have for one to know that it's working and working properly? I've been going on and off my meds because I felt they didn't do much, maybe make me feel a little more slowed and the only thing I would notice is when I would drink a coffee that my body got extremely anxious but other than that I couldn't notice anything. My coworker who also has ADHD told me he thought I was physically calmer. 

I've been going on and off because I felt that if they didn't do much for me that it would make no sense to keep taking them but then I would start taking them again because I was curious if I just had forgotten what they did for me (I have an extremely bad memory). So it's been a back and forth of taking my meds. Another friend with  ADHD told me that some meds need a while to build up for them to have a noticable effect but I wouldn't know how long that would take and I wouldn't be able to notice the difference because I forget what I feel and felt like all the time so I have nothing to compare myself to.

My main issues with having ADHD are extreme impulsivity, especially my explosive anger, I interrupt people and I'm a ""flap-out"" that does and says before she thinks about things. I also am very impulsive with big life choices, I've dropped out of post-high school education about 8 times within 6 years and I'm starting again in september and I just really want this to work out. 

I don't feel like I have a brain that's on all the time and I don't feel negatively hyperactive in my body, I just act and am very energetic and like that about myself, I just wish I had a grasp on my emotional dysregulation and was able to be less impulsive because it's really been making my life extremely hard and I was wondering if medication could do that but the medication I have been taking has not helped with this from what I remember. I just took my first pill of concerta again this morning to see if there really is an effect on me and to give it time to settle into my system, but I'm not mega confident it will do much.

Do I need a different type of medication?  A different dosage? I'm at a loss so I was wondering what you guys had to say about this! I should and will talk to my doctor but I wanted to hear from fellow ADHDers first just to have some extra background info.",1,1746514094.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

I need advice on if I should pay for my half of a dinner date with a guy I won't be seein again. 

I (26f) matched with a guy on a dating app and we decided to go on a coffee date. The coffee date was alright and he was a pleasant guy but I wasn't sure about the chemistry being there. I was still interested in him so when he asked me on a second date I agreed and we went out again last night. We had a nice time again and good conversation but I still wasn't sure if the connection was there, as there were a lot of awkward moments through out the night. When he walked me to my car, he tried to kiss me, and I awkward dodged it by going in for a hug while he kissed my cheek. We said our goodbyes and went home.

We talked a little bit over text today and I let him know tonight that, though I enjoyed getting to know him, I wasn't interested in moving forward. I know I should have told him at the end of the date but I felt really awkward after the attempted kiss and I started feeling sick towards the end of the date, which ended up being a small case of food poisoning from the dinner we had. I didn't tell him after I got home because, well, the food poisoning. After I told him that I was no longer interested he asked if I could send him my half of the bill as ""it was a little expensive and I was kinda hoping things would go somewhere"" 

My initial reaction is to say no since there is no guarantees in dating, especially on a second date. However I know that dating is expensive for men as they are often expected to pay on dates. Should I pay him back for my half of the bill? 

PS. Even though I'm in my mid 20s, I'm new to dating as I was in an 8 year long relationship that recently ended and I didn't date prior to that person. Any and all advice is needed and welcome. ",2,1746513931.0,TwoHotTakes,27,0.57,False

---  

It was a dark and stormy night…
The kind of night where lightning forks the sky like a divorce lawyer with a vengeance, and thunder grumbles like God forgot where He put His coffee.

Inside the crumbling manor at the edge of town—a town that had given up hope, dreams, and municipal funding—there sat a man. Or at least a silhouette of one. His name was Bartholomew D. Cradlewhip, a name passed down like a stubborn rash through generations of melodramatic minor aristocracy.

He sipped his brandy with all the tension of someone waiting for a ghost to arrive on schedule.
And at exactly midnight, it did.

The ghost—Mildred—was punctual, annoyed, and wearing a hat that suggested unfinished business and 1930s millinery.

“You summoned me?” she hissed, like a radiator with opinions.

Cradlewhip rose dramatically from his leather armchair, which sighed beneath him like a widowed couch.

“Yes, Mildred. I have questions.”

She floated three inches above the carpet, already exasperated. “If this is about the soup tureen, I *told* you—check the crawlspace.”

“No. Not the tureen.” He paused for thunder. It didn’t come. “...I want to know why every time I light a candle in this house, it *goes out* when I turn around.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Because you bought your candelabras at IKEA, Bart. And because you live in a drafty hell-palace that smells like gout.”

At that moment, the wind howled, the windows shuddered, and a single violin—unplayed and possibly imaginary—let out a dissonant squeak.

Cradlewhip nodded solemnly.

“So it *was* you,” he whispered.
Mildred’s ghost scoffed. “What? No. That’s the violin rat. He lives in the walls. You named him Jeremy.”

Cradlewhip slumped back into his chair. “I miss when hauntings meant something.”

She shrugged. “It’s the gig economy, babe.”

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Allen Roth patio furniture line boasts several features designed to enhance outdoor comfort and longevity.

**Frame Construction:** Allen Roth patio furniture typically features frames constructed from either powder-coated steel or aluminum.

Powder-coated steel offers excellent strength and stability, making it suitable for heavier use and larger furniture pieces. The powder coating provides a protective layer against rust and corrosion, extending the lifespan of the furniture. Aluminum frames, on the other hand, are lightweight and naturally resistant to rust, making them ideal for coastal environments or areas with high humidity. The choice between steel and aluminum often depends on the specific piece and the intended use.

**Cushion Materials:** The cushions used in Allen Roth patio furniture are crafted from weather-resistant fabrics like olefin or polyester.

These fabrics are designed to withstand the elements, including sunlight, rain, and mildew. Olefin is particularly known for its durability and resistance to fading, while polyester offers a softer feel and is often more affordable. The cushions are typically filled with high-density foam or fiberfill, providing comfortable support for extended periods. Many cushions also feature removable covers for easy cleaning and maintenance.

**Design Styles:** Allen Roth offers a variety of design styles to suit different tastes and outdoor aesthetics.

From traditional wicker designs to modern, minimalist styles, there's an Allen Roth collection to complement any patio or deck. The brand often incorporates elements like clean lines, neutral color palettes, and textured finishes to create a sophisticated and inviting outdoor space. Some collections also feature unique details like decorative accents, intricate weaves, or integrated storage solutions.

**Tabletop Materials:** Dining tables and coffee tables in the Allen Roth line often feature tabletops made from materials like tempered glass, faux wood, or composite materials.

Tempered glass provides a sleek and modern look while being easy to clean and maintain. Faux wood tabletops offer the aesthetic appeal of natural wood without the maintenance requirements, as they are resistant to warping, cracking, and fading. Composite materials, such as resin or concrete, provide a durable and weather-resistant surface that can withstand heavy use and extreme temperatures.

**Warranty Coverage:** Allen Roth patio furniture typically comes with a limited warranty that covers manufacturing defects and structural issues.

The specific terms of the warranty can vary depending on the product and the retailer, but it generally covers the frame and major components for a certain period, such as one to three years. It's important to review the warranty details carefully to understand the coverage and any limitations. Routine maintenance, such as cleaning and storing the furniture properly, is usually required to keep the warranty valid.

Key features of Allen Roth patio furniture include:

* Durable frame construction
* Weather-resistant cushion materials

Usually I slap on a podcast episode and time flies by. I was well rested with a coffee already down and another one to sip on.

I queued up the Dave Smith & Douglas Murray episode. Thought I was in for hot takes and polite Oxford smack‑talk. Instead, I got a one‑way ticket to Neurological Chernobyl.

Douglas Murray’s olympic level mental gymnastics were so fkn impressive, I damn near had a stroke trying to follow his thought process. I am absolutely certain that I lost a few million neurons somewhere around Kingston. If benzos come with a ‘don’t operate heavy machinery’ label, then this episode needs one too. 

Coffee? Indeed, worthless. Turned up the A/C till nipples were indeed bleeding and I was still indeed dozing off. Meth indeed couldn’t have made this any better. Indeed, I had to pull over in some random town like I just got indeed touched by Murray trying sucking my will to live out. I swear on everything holy, it just felt like I got roofied. It wasnt right for anyone’s life to be put in danger because I was curious to see what Guantanamo bay type torture felt like. Not that I’ve ever been, of course.

Indeed, trip ended up lasting nine brutal hours. I’m 25, and had to take a nap at two occasions. By the time I rolled into Montreal, I was barely down an hour on the podcast. I might’ve lived to see another day, but whole thing shaved at least a few weeks off my lifespan. Along with the fact that I can’t read any Israel-Palestine headline without flashbacks to that drive. 

This is why, reflecting back on the whole thing, I know  Murray is 1-0 after this debate. I got no doubt in my now crippled mind that that grade A wagyu selective retardism needs to be classified as a weapon of mass destruction. ",1,1746512931.0,conspiracy,1,0.55,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The coffees selected for this review were evaluated based on several key features, including bean origin, roasting process, flavor profile, acidity, body, and overall quality. These factors play a crucial role in determining the coffee's taste, aroma, and suitability for different brewing methods.

**Bean Origin and Quality:** The origin of the coffee bean significantly impacts its flavor profile. Coffees from Ethiopia, for instance, are known for their floral and citrus notes, while those from Colombia often exhibit a more balanced and nutty character.

The quality of the beans, assessed by factors like bean size, density, and defect count, directly affects the final cup quality. Specialty-grade beans, which meet stringent quality standards, typically yield the best-tasting coffee.

**Roasting Process:** Light roasting involves heating the coffee beans to a lower internal temperature than medium or dark roasting. This shorter roasting time preserves more of the bean's inherent flavors and acidity.

The skill and precision of the roaster are crucial in achieving a consistent and even roast, ensuring that the coffee's potential is fully realized. A well-executed light roast will highlight the bean's unique characteristics without introducing unwanted flavors.

**Flavor Profile:** Light roast coffees are often characterized by bright and complex flavor profiles, featuring notes of citrus, berries, floral, and herbal nuances.

The specific flavor notes can vary depending on the bean's origin, processing method, and roasting style. Some light roasts may exhibit a delicate sweetness, while others may have a more pronounced acidity.

**Acidity:** Acidity is a key characteristic of light roast coffees, contributing to their vibrant and refreshing taste. It refers to the sharp, tangy sensation that lingers on the palate.

The level of acidity can range from mild and balanced to bright and zesty, depending on the coffee's origin and roasting level. While some people enjoy the pronounced acidity of light roasts, others may prefer a more mellow cup.

**Body:** Body refers to the perceived weight and texture of the coffee in the mouth. Light roast coffees typically have a lighter body compared to darker roasts, which tend to be more full-bodied.

The body can range from delicate and tea-like to slightly creamy, depending on the bean's characteristics and brewing method. A well-balanced light roast will have a pleasing body that complements its other flavor attributes.

**Overall Quality:** The overall quality of a light roast coffee is determined by the harmony and balance of its various characteristics, including flavor, acidity, body, and aroma.

A high-quality light roast will exhibit a complex and nuanced flavor profile, a pleasant acidity, a well-balanced body, and an inviting aroma. It should also be free from any off-flavors or defects.

 ## Core Benefits

Light roast coffee offers several distinct benefits that make it a popular choice among coffee lovers. These benefits include enhanced flavor complexity, higher acidity, increased caffeine content, and greater versatility.

**Enhanced Flavor Complexity:** Light roasts retain more of the coffee bean's original flavors, resulting in a more complex and nuanced cup. Users appreciate the ability to discern subtle flavor notes such as citrus, berries, floral, and herbal nuances, which provide a richer and more rewarding coffee experience. This translates to a more engaging sensory experience compared to the often more homogenous flavors of darker roasts.

**Higher Acidity:** The higher acidity in light roast coffee contributes to its bright and refreshing taste. With its tangy and zesty character, it provides a stimulating and invigorating start to the day. This makes light roasts an excellent choice for those who enjoy a vibrant and lively cup of coffee.

**Increased Caffeine Content:** Light roast coffees generally have a higher caffeine content than darker roasts because the roasting process degrades caffeine over time. This means that light roasts can provide a more pronounced energy boost, making them a popular choice for those who need a caffeine kick.

**Greater Versatility:** Light roasts are incredibly versatile and can be brewed using various methods, including pour-over, French press, and espresso. Users find they can experiment with different brewing techniques to extract different flavor profiles, maximizing the coffee's potential. This provides a wide range of possibilities for customization and enjoyment.

1kfxqrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1kfxqrs/my_day_with_my_partner_with_autism/,My day with my partner with autism,"This is just a insight to my day with my partner being autistic with adhd. (Not everyone with autism has all of these tendencies but I just think our daily routine is kinda cute and I don't mind) 

He wakes up before me and brushes his teeth/coffee ect. I go behind and wipe down all the toothpaste spots and dripped coffee and make sure everything gets put back in it's place. I sometimes have to go around to the sinks and make sure they're turned off and double check the shower is completely shut off. Next is I remind him to take his medication/allergy meds he needs for the day, some days he forgets some days he takes them before I'm done brushing my teeth. I update our calendar on the fridge so he can physically see any upcoming events or tasks we have and I also double check our mutual phone calendar (we use time tree so it alerts both our phones and we can both add stuff on it) helps him mentally prepare for parties or outings and helps me remember if I have to get gifts or supplies. Next I usually write out a shopping list for the day or week on the fridge and ask him to add whatever he wants/needs sometimes he adds stuff sometimes we go wild and just get whatever at the store and I have to reorganize the fridge lol. 
Before shopping I do have him help me go through the fridge and throw out any bad leftovers or stuff we just havent touched and won't touch. Then I go and put his shoes away on shoe racks or in the closet depending on the shoes. I also make sure he has access to a pitcher of water and refill it throughout the day because he can and will forget to drink water and also will not just use the tap filter unless I pour it in a pitcher first and stick that in the fridge. I check in with him and make sure I haven't disturbed too much of what he needs and give him plenty of control over everything comming in or out of the house too. Next I make sure his work bag has plenty of snacks and protein bars because he will absolutely forget to stop for lunch and then be insanely thrown off and grumpy and have no clue why. He also doesn't like carrying a lunch box around or have an extra pack for his lunch, we tried it for a week and he either forgot it at home or forgot it at work without eating any of it so we stick to easy small snacks in his bag. If he's having a rough day or too much anxiety or things going on I send his mom a few messages and she will call him and help him feel better and calm down and I absolutely love and adore her for it. I also spend some time closing doors/turning off lights and such because he just goes and goes lol. Lastly at the very end of the day I set out his work clothes and socks and shoes so he knows exactly where they will be and he doesn't have to think about it. 
I love him so much and I do not mind doing any of this stuff for him. He absolutely could and did live on his own and do stuff by himself but he tells me all the time I make his life easier and help calm the chaos he unintentionally causes. 
Also to be noted these are Tiny minor things I do for him and our home to keep it in a more organized manner. We have 1 dog and 1 cat as well and he does EVERYTHING for them except give them wet food. I like to give them yummy wet foods and treats every so often but since it's not part of a routine he doesn't tend to do it, but litter boxes, walking, feeding schedule, baths, all of it is on him and he has it perfected. 
If anyone has a similar situation lmk I'd love to hear your routines or anything you think is interesting. We are expecting our first kid so chaos is going to be here pretty quick and I could use the insight navigating it with a baby. (We know for sure our kid is probably gonna be autistic because my partner and his father and his grandfather are all autistic, so it seems to be the men carry the line for it, his grandpa was never diagnosed but we all can tell. His dad was also disagnosed as an adult after my partner was diagnosed when he was a little kid and went OH WAIT THATS WHY to all kinds of stuff) ",2,1746512709.0,autism,2,1.0,False

I (28F) just found out my boyfriend (29M) of three years has been cheating on me. With my older brother. Who I haven't seen or talked to in 17 years.

So some quick backstory, My brother (we'll call him J) came out as gay when he was 17. Our parents were super conservative, like disgustingly homophobic. I was 15 at the time and honestly, I repeated a lot of the shit I heard growing up. I was a kid, I didn’t really know better. Anyway, J left home the day he turned 18, totally cut ties. No socials, no contact, no anything. It was like he just disappeared.

fast forward to now, I’ve done a lot of growing up. I don’t think like that anymore at all, and I’ve carried a lot of guilt about how I treated him. I always figured he had every reason to never want to see me again so I never tried to reach out.

So. My boyfriend, ""T"", and I had been living together for about three years, Things were decent, I thought. Not perfect or anything, but we had plans. We talked about getting a dog. A future. All that.

Then like a month ago I ran into this girl I kinda know, M. She’s a mutual friend from parties and group hangs, We saw each other at the store and chatted a bit and then she goes “hey sorry about the break up”

I was like ?? what breakup??

She kinda froze and said something like “Oh... I just saw T at that new place downtown, he was with someone, they were close the whole night, very touchy, I didn't talk to them but it seemed clear”

I laughed it off but inside I was spiraling. That night I couldn’t sleep. I kept telling myself maybe she was wrong, maybe it was nothing but I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so I bought this cheap-ass little cam online, one you can hide in like a plant or whatever. I hid it on a shelf pointed at our hallway, right outside the bedroom.

Couple nights later I go to dinner at my sister’s. Leave the cam running. When I get home, he’s already knocked out, nothing weird. I check the footage.

Around 6:30pm I see him come in with someone. A guy. Kinda tall, lean, black tshirt. They go into our bedroom. Don’t come out for over an hour.

I couldn’t see the guy’s face clearly—cheap camera, crap lighting. But it was def a guy. I didn’t even know T liked guys, which whatever, not the point, but I was shook.

next morning I confronted him. He denied it, tried to gaslight me at first, but once I showed him the footage he just went quiet. Then he started mumbling, said he was “confused” and “figuring himself out.” I asked who the hell the guy was. He didn’t wanna tell me but eventually agreed to set up a meeting. I told him I wanted to see the person he threw our relationship away for.

So we meet at this coffee shop. T walks in first, then the guy. And when I saw him. and holy shit.

It was my brother. J.

He looked... different, older, hair shorter and dyed blondish, had stubble, but it was him, He saw me and it took him a moment but he realized too.

“What the hell is going on,” he said, looking between us

T looked confused. “Wait... you two know each other?”

And J goes, “yeah dumbass that my sister”

the silence after that was... unreal, I just sat there staring.

None of us knew. T didn’t know J was my brother. J didn’t know T was my boyfriend or even dating anyone, and I had no idea either of them were even in contact.

J looked sick. He got up and basically said “fuck this, this is crazy, I'm not dealing with this today.” And walked out.

That was four days ago.

T moved out yesterday. I blocked him on everything. I haven’t heard from J since and I’m not sure I even want to. I know logically he didn’t *do* anything wrong. He didn’t know. But still. It’s just... a lot.

I feel sick and angry and sad all at once. I keep crying randomly. And it’s all just so stupidly surreal. Like a bad joke. Like something from a soap opera.

i have no idea what to do or think, but I needed to put this out there. I'm just going to try to sleep now and read what people have to say later. bye",1,1746512401.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 👋

You know when you feel like you're juggling 137 things at once and you're just one email away from a full-on meltdown? Yep, been there! Recently, I found myself completely drained, like coffee wasn't even cutting it anymore. 😴 So, I thought, **what the heck, let’s try something new!**

Enter *cyclic breathing*. 🌬️ Ever heard of it? It’s this simple yet magical breathing technique that’s supposed to help with stress and focus. And guess what? It’s actually backed by science! Intrigued? I sure was! 😅

So, I decided to try cyclic breathing for 7 days straight. Spoiler alert: it’s like a spa day for your nervous system! 🧘‍♀️

**Here’s the lowdown:**

- **What is Cyclic Breathing?**  
  Imagine breathing where you inhale, hold, exhale, and hold again, creating a cycle. It’s like a for-loop of breathing!
  
- **How I Did It:**  
  1. Find a comfy spot. No distractions (so, lock up the cat!).
  2. Inhale through the nose for 4 seconds.
  3. Hold that breath for 4 seconds. Feel the anticipation!
  4. Exhale for 4 seconds, slowly, like you’re deflating a balloon.
  5. Hold the exhale (yep, no breath) for 4 seconds.
  6. Repeat for about 5 minutes or until your mind stops racing around like a squirrel on Red Bull.

- **Why It Works:**  
  Turns out, this practice reduces cortisol—yup, that pesky stress hormone. Plus, it enhances focus. Felt like my brain went from dial-up to fiber-optic in just a few days! 🚀

- **Unexpected Perks:**  
  Not only did I feel more centered, but I also caught myself smiling at random strangers more. Weird side-effect? Joyful? Perhaps!

**Was it easy?** Y’all, not gonna lie, it was tricky at first! I’d catch myself zoning out or thinking about my grocery list (Oops!). But, practice makes perfect—or at least perfectly flawed—which is totally okay!

Has anyone else tried cyclic breathing or any other nifty tricks to combat burnout? I’m curious if others felt the same serene Jedi vibes I did.

So there it is, my little adventure in breath and sanity. If you’re feeling the burnout blues, maybe give it a whirl? Or share what’s worked for you! Can’t wait to hear your stories!

**Who Is Than Merrill and What’s This Series About Anyway?**  
Let’s start with the basics. *Than Merrill - 6 Week Negotiation Series* is a super hands-on training program created by the real estate mogul himself—Than Merrill, from FortuneBuilders. If you’ve ever seen him on TV or attended one of his events, you know this guy knows his stuff. In this series, he focuses entirely on one of the most critical skills for real estate success: *negotiation.* Whether you're a newbie or seasoned investor, if you can't negotiate, you're leaving thousands (maybe more) on the table.

**What Do You Actually Learn in This Course?**  
This isn't just vague advice about ""being confident."" Than breaks down negotiation into six laser-focused sessions—each tackling a different real estate situation: sellers, private lenders, banks, contractors, buyers, and business partners. You’ll learn how to lower renovation bids, close full-price offers, and get banks to approve your deals. The coolest part? Each week comes with objection-handling scripts *and* access to an online audio library so you can hit “play” and hear Than handle objections in real-time. Total game-changer when you’re in the middle of a deal.

**When Should You Take This Series?**  
Right now is a good time—especially if you’re in the trenches of investing or planning to be. The real estate market shifts constantly, and your ability to negotiate can mean the difference between a good deal and a “run screaming” nightmare. Whether you’re currently facing tough sellers, flaky contractors, or curious lenders, *Than Merrill - 6 Week Negotiation Series* teaches you how to deal with them all like a pro.

**Where Does This Stuff Apply?**  
Literally anywhere you’re doing deals. This is not theory—it’s practical negotiation knowledge designed for *real world* scenarios. Whether you're negotiating terms in a coffee shop with a seller or doing deals virtually from your laptop, the tactics are meant to work wherever you’re working. You can even use these strategies outside of real estate—like when partnering in other businesses or hiring team members.

**Why This Training Is Worth It**  
Because negotiation is *everything* in real estate. Than doesn’t just show you what to say—he teaches you how to say it, when to say it, and what to do when the other person says ""no."" You get real-world tactics like how to drop your purchase price by $5K on the spot, or how to make a private lender feel excited about handing you money. Plus, with the included DVD set and the lifetime objections audio library, you’ll always have a cheat code when you need it.

**How Does Than Teach You?**  
This series is broken into weekly online sessions with live coaching and deep dives into each negotiation topic. Each session is super tactical—scripts, step-by-steps, and real examples. You also get objection packets every week so you’re never caught off guard. And when the series is done, you don’t just walk away with notes—you get the whole thing on DVD to revisit anytime.

**Final Thoughts on Than Merrill’s Negotiation Series**  
If you want to sharpen your edge and stop leaving money on the table, *Than Merrill - 6 Week Negotiation Series* delivers real-world value. It’s not fluff. It’s not outdated. It’s a system designed for closers—and if you’re serious about scaling your real estate game, this is a killer investment. Negotiation isn’t optional—it’s the core skill that’ll keep your business alive and thriving.
