During the day it's general folk, getting a coffee/breakfast before work or a bite after their shift ends, but during the night usually a bit the more sleazy types.

Luckily everyone appreciates the diner being here and open all of the time, so they don't get much trouble. One time someone tried to rob the place, but the man found himself down on his luck quickly enough when over 6 patrons drew their weapons on him and politely suggested he make himself scarce.

We are trying to update our living room to be more cohesive and comfortable for lounging and hosting. We would love thoughts and recommendations for ways to tie the space together more and help increase the cozy factor. Pretty much anything is fair game for changing out except for the couch and the plant bench.

Current updating thoughts:
1) change long coffee table for either square or round ottoman and utilize wooden trays for the harder surface; we‚Äôd also consider a round coffee table instead 
2) add rug and curtains - unsure about rug color, looking to do more sheer, ivory curtains to make the space feel taller
3) radiator box for the radiator
4) additional art 
5) blankets in either a basket elsewhere in the room or in the ottoman

Movie nights have become this whole production where we pretend we‚Äôre creating some magical experience, but really we‚Äôre just trying to watch something without falling asleep or getting distracted by our phones. The bar is practically underground at this point.



But here‚Äôs what nobody talks about: when you nail the basics, everything clicks.

Not the Instagram-worthy setup with fairy lights and color-coordinated throw pillows. Just the simple shit that makes the difference between ‚Äúmeh, that was fine‚Äù and ‚Äúholy shit, we need to do this more often.‚Äù



This article is about getting the foundation right so everything else falls into place.

*What‚Äôs your movie night personality: solo sanctuary or chaotic group energy?*



# Your Ultimate Movie Night Survival Kit



# 1. Snacks Worth Giving a Damn About



Food is half the experience. Maybe more than half if we‚Äôre being honest.

https://preview.redd.it/wwrm5i9xrprf1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cf2670ddbab12629581b3bdd201e98c976b1cf

# Popcorn without the regret

Microwave popcorn is perfectly fine if you buy the good stuff. Stop being a snob about it. You can try:

* Movie theater butter flavor (embrace the goodness!)
* Kettle corn for sweet-salty perfection
* Spicy varieties that won‚Äôt murder your mouth
* Plain salted so you can add your own toppings
* Buy extra bags because you will eat more than planned

# Sweet stuff that matters

* Chocolate-covered anything (pretzels, raisins, whatever)
* Gummy bears that don‚Äôt require dental work to chew
* M&Ms or similar that won‚Äôt melt in your hands
* Sour candy for people who enjoy pain
* Ice cream for pause-worthy moments

# Savory backup options

* Chips that don‚Äôt sound like construction work when you eat them
* Crackers and cheese if you‚Äôre feeling fancy
* Nuts that aren‚Äôt stupidly salted
* Veggie straws for pretending you‚Äôre healthy

Buy more than you think you need. Also, choose stuff that won‚Äôt turn your fingers into a crime scene during intense scenes.

# 2. Drinks That Match Your Vibe



You need liquid, but you also need to not spend half the movie in the bathroom. Strategy matters here.



# Fizzy drinks that make sense

Soda is fine. Sparkling water is fine. Stop overthinking it.

* Coke or Pepsi for classic movie vibes
* Flavored sparkling water if you want to feel fancy
* Energy drinks for marathon sessions (I‚Äôm biased to RedBull, of course)

# Hot drinks for cozy nights

Perfect when you want to feel wrapped up and comfortable while people make terrible decisions on screen.

* Hot chocolate with (real) marshmallows
* Coffee, if you‚Äôre planning to stay awake
* Tea for the sophisticated crowd
* Hot cider when it‚Äôs cold outside

https://preview.redd.it/b8eqhj65sprf1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e925c9f76c5f094a62f2c9a1aa102a9ddc2084c

# The spill situation

Get cups with lids. Get coasters. Accept that spills will happen anyway.

* Travel mugs with secure lids for jump scare protection
* Coasters that actually stay put
* Napkins within arm‚Äôs reach



***Read*** [***Alien: Earth FX Series - An Alien Story That Doesn‚Äôt Bore Me***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/alien-earth-fx-series-review-great-watch)



# 3. Tech That Won‚Äôt Betray You



Your technology should work when you need it. That‚Äôs literally its only job here.

https://preview.redd.it/9u7wjsa8sprf1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0d92c04c6a2fa68271c0122ebf9156b44171681

# Streaming basics

Test your shit before you need it. Update apps during the day, not when you‚Äôre ready to watch.

* Streaming sticks that don‚Äôt freeze during action scenes
* Multiple streaming apps because everything‚Äôs on different platforms now (can we start a petition?)
* Internet speed that can handle what you‚Äôre throwing at it
* Ethernet cables as backup for WiFi failures

# Audio that doesn‚Äôt suck

TV speakers are usually trash. Fix this problem or live with disappointment.

* Soundbars for better dialogue clarity
* Bluetooth speakers you can actually connect to
* Headphones for late-night solo sessions



# Essential apps and tools

* IMDb for ‚ÄúWhere do I know that actor from?‚Äù emergencies

# 4. Your Ideal Comfort Setup



You‚Äôre going to be sitting in one spot for hours. Make it not suck.

https://preview.redd.it/gq27mp1csprf1.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc4da35ab6abfb403607c3483c992d7fbd361432

# Seating reality

Your couch has limits. Plan for actual human bodies and their weird comfort needs.

* Enough pillows for everyone‚Äôs back support preferences
* Blankets that don‚Äôt fight back when you try to share
* Floor cushions for overflow seating
* Ottomans or footrests for proper leg positioning



# Temperature control

Everyone runs hot or cold differently. Be prepared for climate negotiations.

* Multiple blanket options in different weights
* Fans for people who overheat easily
* Extra layers for the chronically cold
* Windows that can actually open if needed



# Lighting that makes sense

You need to see your snacks, but not feel like you‚Äôre in an interrogation room.

* Dimmable lamps or overhead lights
* LED strips behind the TV to reduce eye strain
* Blackout curtains for daytime viewing
* Candles for atmosphere (placed safely away from chaos)



# Space organization

* Side tables or surfaces within arm‚Äôs reach
* Designated spots for phones and remotes
* Trash bins that people will actually use
* Clear pathways to the bathroom



***Check out*** [***Happy Gilmore 2: Re-enter Hilarious Sandman***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/happy-gilmore-2-movie-review)



# 5. When You Want to Go All Out



Sometimes regular movie nights aren‚Äôt enough. Sometimes you need to make it an event.



# Horror night setup

Lean into the creepy vibes without making it impossible to see your snacks.

* Dim lighting that still lets you navigate safely
* Candles placed where nobody will knock them over
* Snacks that won‚Äôt crunch during [**quiet scary moments**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/ryan-coogler-sinners-2025-movie-review)
* Blankets for hiding behind during [**jump scares**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/weapons-zach-cregger-s-twisted-small-town-nightmare)



# Group night coordination

More people means more potential for chaos. Plan accordingly.

* Clear communication about start times and expectations
* Assigned snack responsibilities so you‚Äôre not doing everything
* Seating arrangements that prevent territorial wars
* Volume levels that work for conversation and actual movie watching



# Build Your Perfect Kit



Your ideal night isn‚Äôt everyone else‚Äôs ideal night. Figure out what works for you and lean into it. The Ultimate Movie Night Survival Kit is a custom thing.

https://preview.redd.it/npepf07hsprf1.png?width=457&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6e8d625dd366afb82e1d3ef13d2d87182c76b38

Know your style:

* **Thrill seeker:** Jump scares and questionable character choices are your jam
* **Group coordinator:** You somehow make it work for everyone from toddlers to grandparents
* **Solo specialist:**¬†You and your couch have reached an understanding

Mix and match what makes sense. There‚Äôs no wrong way as long as you end up happy with popcorn instead of regret.



# Stop Making Movie Nights Harder Than They Need to Be



Good snacks, working tech, and a setup that doesn‚Äôt make you want to relocate to the floor. That‚Äôs the secret. Everything else is just details.

Your movie nights should be something you anticipate, not endure. Get the basics right and everything else becomes easier.

He usually has a laptop out, typing away like he‚Äôs coding or working on something important. He‚Äôs got that nerdy but sharp look, button-down shirts that are slightly wrinkled, glasses that actually make him look hotter instead of dorky. I find myself staring sometimes without meaning to, just watching the way he focuses...

I‚Äôve never really talked to him beyond a quick smile at the counter. Sometimes I think he lingers nearby, like he‚Äôs waiting to catch my eye again, but maybe that‚Äôs just my imagination. Part of me wants to be bold and just start a conversation, but another part of me worries I‚Äôll come off too strong. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that women who make the first move seem desperate, and that thought kind of holds me back.

At the same time, I don‚Äôt want this chance to slip away. What if he‚Äôs also into me and just waiting for a signal? I keep playing out fake scenarios in my head, like dropping a silly comment about his laptop stickers or ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù asking him for help with something tech related. I don‚Äôt want to overthink it, but I don‚Äôt want to regret staying silent either.

So do I go for it and risk rejection, or stay quiet and hope he notices me first? Because the truth is, every time I walk in and see him, I can‚Äôt help imagining how it would feel if things went further.",1,1758982006.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I just returned from my quick getaway with some freshest fall pieces for you guys and genuinely, I'm thrilled with the quality of these bargains. The fit on each thing turned out super well. I even succeeded in not getting the second coffee stain on the Supreme hoodie‚ÄîI took the first one out of the house for a grand total of ten minutes before catastrophe hit. That thing has a magnetic pull towards dark liquids, but at least the grey color covers it up well!
Let's get to it:

Carhartt black jacket: This jacket is so tough, the canvas is heavy and looks durable. The black is an intense color that is fantastic. A size S would be ideal for a fitted look with room for a thin layer underneath. 9/10.

Ralph Lauren down vest: The vest is ever so puffed and incredibly warm yet not at all bulky. The fabric is smooth and the hardware is top-notch. I would opt for a size M for a comfortable fit layering well over a bulkier sweatshirt. 9.5/10.

Supreme grey Hoodie: This is what you want‚Äîfleece on the inside is super soft and the grey color is timeless. The hood is generously thick and keeps shape perfectly. A size M provides that perfect loose, snuggly drape. 10/10.

broken planet Hoodie: The design on this is quite detailed and neat. The cotton is thick and has a solid feel to it, making the hoodie excellent in terms of structure. A size S would provide a good, slightly boxy and trendy fit. 9/10.

Kapok Flower Hoodie: I really like the appearance of this one; the trim is subtle but crisp, and the material is thick and good quality. A S would be a good fit, providing a crisp, relaxed silhouette. 9.5/10.

Represent Hoodie: The cotton in this feels great and is heavy, just like the high-quality blanks I adore. The fit is on point for a loose streetwear look. A size S provides an ideal loose fit that isn't sloppy. 10/10.

Carhartt long sleeves: This long sleeve is a heavy-duty basic. The material is substantial enough that it drapes well and the stitches appear heavy duty. Size M would provide me with a good, loose, slightly oversized fit. 9/10.

Ami sweater: The knitting is dense and the tiny embroidery is actually very neat, demonstrating excellent craftsmanship. The fabric is soft and warm to touch. A size S would provide a sleek, cozy fit that appears sharp. 9.5/10.

Cro Heart Hoodie: Print is crisp and the cotton is smooth and heavy. It's a very cozy hoodie with a nice-fitting hood. Size M provides that loose and relaxed shape I prefer. 10/10.

Who Decides War Hoodie: The material is comfortable and the graphics are original and really stand out. It feels high quality and prepared for cooler weather. A size S would provide a comfortable, standard fit that still looks laid-back. 9.5/10.

St√ºssy Sweater: This sweater has a great chunky texture to the knit and feels incredibly warm. The logo is clearly woven into the material. A size M would give a comfortably relaxed and easy fit. 9.5/10.

St√ºssy Yellow long Sleeve Shirt: The yellow is bright and the fabric is heavy but not too much. It has an awesome boxy and relaxed cut. A size M hangs very well, creating a relaxed, laid-back look. 9/10.

St√ºssy black long sleeves: The cotton is heavy and soft, and the graphic print is extremely clean. The sleeves are structured feeling. An S size would fit perfectly, with a comfortable standard long sleeve fit. 9.5/10.

GALLERYDEPT Jeans: The denim is great colorwise, and the distressed finish is done properly. The fabric is heavy and feels substantial. A 30 would drape well on the waist, creating a relaxed, straight-leg fit. 10/10.

Represent Short Sleeves: The cotton for this tee is thick and structured, so it hangs beautifully. The collar is beefy and retains its shape beautifully. A size S provides a relaxed, boxy fit. 9.5/10.

Gucci baseball cap: The fabric is high quality, and the logo stitching is well clean and precise. It fits easily and has a wonderful shape. The cap is an excellent timeless piece. 10/10.

BAPE White short sleeves: The design is vibrant and looks great against the pure white cotton. The shirt is soft and comfortable to wear. A size M would provide a good, comfortable, and slightly loose fit. 9/10.

Cro Heart White short sleeves: The cotton is thick and smooth, and the heart graphic is really clean on the chest. The cut is contemporary and slightly boxy. A size S would be really comfortable structured fit. 9.5/10.

Burberry Beach Shorts: The material of the shorts is light, thus ideal for hot weather, and the design appears very sharp. The waistband is relaxed and stretchy. A M size would be the ideal, relaxed fit that sits beautifully on the leg. 9/10.

Ralph Lauren long Sleeve Shirt: The cotton here is crisp and feels upscale, and the tailoring appears very clean and refined. A size S would provide a neatly tailored, clean, and business-like appearance. 10/10.

BAPE Miami Double Hood Zipper Coat: The coat is an amazing, one-of-a-kind design with the double hood. The material is heavy duty-looking and the zippers are silky smooth. A size M would be perfect for a deliberately slightly oversized, eye-catching look. 9.5/10.

1nrw2oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/typebattle/comments/1nrw2oy/solve_this/,Solve this,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about how small daily habits slowly shape the entire direction of a person‚Äôs life, even though most of the time they feel too small to matter in the moment. It‚Äôs kind of amazing how something as ordinary as the way you start your morning can set the tone for the next twelve hours. For example, when I wake up and immediately check my phone, I notice that my attention is scattered for the rest of the day, but if I spend even five quiet minutes stretching or making coffee before looking at any screens, the whole day feels calmer. It makes me wonder how many other ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù habits are quietly steering the course of our routines without us noticing. Another thing I‚Äôve been noticing is how conversations with strangers can completely change my mood. A short exchange with a cashier, a friendly nod from someone walking their dog, or even a random comment on a post like this can remind me that everyone is carrying their own set of worries and dreams. It sounds cheesy, but those tiny moments of connection are like little sparks that keep the bigger picture of life feeling hopeful. I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has small habits like this that they‚Äôve experimented with‚Äîmaybe a bedtime ritual, a favorite walking route, or a trick for staying focused when the day feels overwhelming. Sometimes hearing other people‚Äôs little strategies is more inspiring than reading a whole self-help book, because it‚Äôs real life advice that someone is actually using right now. Anyway, if you‚Äôve read this far, I‚Äôd love to know what small change has made a surprisingly big difference for you.",1,1758981854.0,typebattle,1,1.0,False

1nrw2fs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrw2fs,This app improved my brewing,"After tracking my brews on paper in my notebook, it was difficult for me to reference and learn from previous brews, and I didn't find an existing app that I liked that was straightforward to use, so I created my own. I've been using this project for the last couple of weeks and having lots of success with it so I wanted to share it with you.

I wanted an easy to work with app where I'm able to track and filter for particular bean varieties, country or recipe. The app is meant to help you log brews as frictionless as possible.

With the app, I was able to get the most out of each new bag by checking what temperature and grind size was a good starter point for the variety/country. I tend to prefer smaller (12-13g) doses so it really helped to dial in my brews when not a lot of recipes/content exists for these type of doses online.

My friend (26f) came to stay at my (26f) and my boyfriends (27m) house. She planned to stay for a day or two, had another event nearby she would be gone over the weekend for, and then would return to my house.


She never told me how many more days she would stay after she was gone for the weekend and had come back. She mentioned splitting the week between my house and another mutual friends house. Finally Wednesday she tells me she has to leave on Friday morning for a trip she had with other friends. No big deal. For the most part everything was fine. I work from home and got used to being interrupted more frequently but we had a great time catching up throughout the week.

Thursday she tells me she has plans to meet up with somebody she recently met in a city an hour away. Said she‚Äôd be gone two hours. That turns into 4, she calls me and says she planning to stay for dinner but will head back after as it‚Äôs her last night and she wanted to come spend time with me before she left in the morning.

10:30 pm rolls around on that Thursday night and I‚Äôm sleepy so I tell her I‚Äôll leave the front door unlocked for her if she is planning to leave soon. She says thanks she‚Äôll be headed home soon and I got to bed. Wake up at 4:30am and she is in a random parking lot in the city she had gone to to hangout with some guy in. I call her panicked obviously, she assures me she‚Äôs okay. She‚Äôs still planning to be to my house in the morning so she can go on her next trip she has planned.

She ends up telling me three different times that she‚Äôs going to head my way ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. First it was they were grabbing coffee, then it was they‚Äôre grabbing lunch. 

I text her that I find it rude that she had now twice had me leave my front door unlocked all night for her to come home and she just never came back. (The first was the first weekend she was here and she very flippantly apologized saying ‚Äúoh shit my bad yeah I guess I should have texted but it‚Äôs fine‚Äù). 

She calls me at 3:30 that she is STILL not heading back to pick up her things. And is requesting that if I won‚Äôt be home I gather allllll of her belongings and put them in my backyard for her to grab at her leisure.

We end up having a conversation that goes nowhere. She apologizes but keeps making excuses about how she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with this when she stays with other friends, etc. 

Comes back finally at 8pm and is like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I have to drive 6 hours to meet up with my other friends I might have to stop halfway through.‚Äù üëÄ

And I know she‚Äôs fishing for me to tell her to stay tonight, but she has a habit of expecting people to read her mind or give her what she wants without her having to ask so I didn‚Äôt offer up the guest room for another night. If she had asked I obviously would have let her stay.

I helped pack her stuff, made her a cup of tea for the road, and said my goodbyes.

There were definitely other small things that happened while she stayed with us that I kind of just let roll off my back, but the gaslighting on the phone combined with the lack of respect for my time throughout her time here just got me so upset.

I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm crazy and acting like her mom, but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs too much to ask to know when somebody will or won‚Äôt be at my house, and then to tell me I need to pack her stuff for her so that she can continue doing whatever she wants to do just baffled me. I feel disrespected I guess.

Please let me know how you think I should go about handling our future conversation as she intends to talk to me about this situation.

I have had many issues in the past with her that are similar to this, not following through with plans, always changing plans last minute, just generally (the way I was raised) not having respect for other people‚Äôs time. So I‚Äôm not willing to really back down on my overall opinion of the situation if I‚Äôm being honest. ",2,1758981815.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False

Pay attention to these and try not to repeat them.

1 . ‚ùå Nos vemos en lunes.

‚úÖ Nos vemos el lunes. ‚Üí We‚Äôll see each other on Monday.

Days of the week always take the article el (or los in plural), never en.

2 . ‚ùå Qu√© hora empieza la clase?

‚úÖ ¬øA qu√© hora empieza la clase? ‚Üí What time does the class start?

When asking the time of an event, you must use ¬øA qu√© hora‚Ä¶?, not just qu√© hora.

3 . ‚ùå Pagu√© para el caf√©.

‚úÖ Pagu√© el caf√© / Pagu√© por el caf√©. ‚Üí I paid for the coffee.

In Spanish, pagar takes a direct object (pagu√© el caf√©) or can use por to indicate what was paid for. Using para is incorrect.

4 . ‚ùå Depende en el precio.

‚úÖ Depende del precio. ‚Üí It depends on the price.

The verb depender always takes the preposition de, not en.

5 . ‚ùå Al lado a la estaci√≥n.

‚úÖ Al lado de la estaci√≥n. ‚Üí Next to the station.

The phrase al lado is always followed by de, never by a. This mistake is common because English ‚Äúnext to‚Äù or ‚Äúclose to‚Äù often makes learners think of using a for ‚Äúto.‚Äù But in Spanish, the correct preposition is always de.

1nrvy62,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1nrvy62/my_antimotivation_fitness_approach_how_i_work_out/,My anti-motivation fitness approach - how I work out even when I don't want to,"So let's talk about motivation, because I'm pretty sure it's the biggest lie the fitness industry ever sold us. You know that feeling when fitness influencers are like ""you just have to WANT it enough!"" and you're sitting there like... yeah, but what about Tuesday when I had 4 hours of sleep and my motivation is somewhere between zero and ""please let me disappear into this couch forever""?

I spent years waiting for motivation to strike before working out, which meant I basically exercised twice a month when the stars aligned perfectly. 

Then I figured out this whole ""anti-motivation"" system that's kept me consistently active for over a year, even through job stress, family drama, and those weeks where existing feels like an achievement.

Turns out, relying on motivation is like relying on the weather - completely unpredictable and mostly disappointing.

**Why Motivation Is Actually Your Enemy**

**The Motivation Trap I Lived In**

Picture this: Sunday night me is PUMPED. I'm gonna work out every day this week, meal prep like a boss, and finally get my life together. Monday morning me wakes up and that motivation has evaporated faster than my weekend energy.

For the longest time, I thought this meant I was lazy or didn't want it badly enough. Turns out, motivation is just an emotion, and emotions are unreliable as hell. Basing your fitness routine on feeling motivated is like basing your job attendance on feeling excited about work - it's gonna be a very inconsistent schedule.

**The ""All or Nothing"" Motivation Mindset**

When I relied on motivation, every workout had to be PERFECT. I had to feel energetic, have the perfect playlist, wear the right clothes, and complete my full planned routine. If any piece was missing, I'd just skip the whole thing.

This led to weird cycles where I'd either be completely obsessed with working out for 3 weeks, or completely avoiding it for 2 months. No middle ground, no flexibility, just boom or bust.

**The Anti-Motivation System That Actually Works**

**The ""Minimum Viable Workout"" Philosophy**

Instead of planning these elaborate 90-minute gym sessions that require peak motivation, I designed the laziest possible workouts that still count as exercise. My bare minimum is literally 10 minutes of movement. That's it.

Bad day? 10-minute walk around the block. Feeling slightly better? Maybe some bodyweight squats and push-ups. Having a decent day? Full workout. But the commitment is always just 10 minutes, which feels manageable even when I'm running on fumes.

**The ""Show Up in Any Form"" Rule**

I gave myself permission to have completely terrible workouts. Sometimes I go to the gym and just walk on the treadmill for 15 minutes while scrolling my phone. Sometimes I do half-hearted stretching on my living room floor.

The goal isn't having perfect workouts - it's maintaining the habit of showing up. Even terrible workouts reinforce the identity of ""someone who exercises regularly.""

**Tactical Anti-Motivation Strategies**

**1\. The ""No Decisions"" Workout Plan**

I removed all decision-making from my workouts because decisions require mental energy I don't always have. I have the same basic routine for each day of the week:

- Monday: Upper body stuff
- Tuesday: Walk/cardio
- Wednesday: Lower body stuff
- Thursday: Walk/cardio
- Friday: Whatever I feel like (usually nothing intense)

No thinking required. I just follow the schedule like a robot, regardless of how I feel about it.

**2\. The ""Clothes Hack""**

I sleep in workout clothes 2-3 nights a week. When I wake up, I'm already dressed for exercise, which eliminates the ""getting ready"" barrier that my unmotivated brain loves to use as an excuse.

Sounds stupid, but removing even tiny obstacles makes a huge difference when motivation is nowhere to be found.

**3\. The ""Good Enough"" Equipment Setup**

Instead of requiring a full gym setup, I have backup options for every situation:

- Feeling lazy: Resistance bands I can use while watching TV
- Stressed: Just go for a walk while listening to music
- Tired: Gentle yoga videos on YouTube
- Really don't want to move: Stretching in bed (yes, this counts)

Having multiple options means there's always something that feels manageable.

**4\. The ""Bribery System""**

I pair workouts with things I actually want to do. I only listen to certain podcasts while walking. I only watch specific Netflix shows while on the stationary bike. I only get my fancy coffee after morning workouts.

It's psychological bribery, but if it works, it works.

**Dealing With the ""I Don't Feel Like It"" Voice**

**The Negotiation Strategy**

When my brain starts with the ""I'm too tired"" excuses, I don't fight it directly. I negotiate: ""Okay brain, we don't have to do a real workout. Let's just put on workout clothes and see how we feel.""

Usually, putting on the clothes leads to ""well, maybe just a 5-minute walk."" Which sometimes leads to ""actually, I feel slightly better, maybe 10 minutes.""

I trick myself into starting by making the first step ridiculously small.

**The ""Future Me"" Accountability**

I remind myself that I've never regretted working out, but I've regretted skipping workouts hundreds of times. Even terrible workouts make me feel slightly better afterward, while skipping makes me feel guilty and sluggish.

""Do it for Future You"" is way more convincing to my brain than ""do it because you should.""

**The Mental Reframe That Changed Everything**

**Exercise as Self-Care, Not Self-Punishment**

I stopped thinking of workouts as something I ""have to"" do and started framing them as something I ""get to"" do for my mental health. When I'm stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, movement is literally medicine for my brain.

This reframe made exercise feel like taking care of myself instead of checking off a obligation.

**Progress Without Perfection**

I track consistency, not intensity. My goal is to move my body in some way 5 days a week, regardless of how impressive that movement is. A 10-minute walk counts the same as a 60-minute gym session in my tracking.

This removed the perfectionist pressure that used to make me quit after one ""bad"" workout week.

**What Anti-Motivation Looks Like in Practice**

**Monday:** Wake up in workout clothes, feel terrible, negotiate with myself to just walk to the corner store instead of skipping entirely. End up doing a 20-minute walk while listening to music. Count it as a win.

**Tuesday:** Plan to do upper body workout, but feel stressed about work. Compromise and do 10 minutes of stress-relief stretching while watching YouTube. Still counts.

**Wednesday:** Actually feel decent, end up doing a full 45-minute workout because I showed up and got started. But this is the exception, not the requirement.

**The Weekly Reality Check:** Out of 5 planned workout days, maybe 1 is ""perfect,"" 2 are decent, and 2 are bare minimum. But that's infinitely better than 0 days, which is what happened when I waited for motivation.

**Why This Approach Actually Works**

**Consistency Beats Intensity**

Moving a little bit every day is way more beneficial than doing intense workouts twice a month when motivation strikes. Your body and brain adapt to regular movement, not sporadic bursts of activity.

**Habit Formation That Sticks**

When the bar is low enough, you can maintain the habit even during life's rough patches. Instead of falling completely off track during stressful periods, I just scale down to bare minimum mode and keep the routine alive.

**Sustainable for Real Life**

This system accounts for the fact that life is unpredictable and motivation is unreliable. It's designed for humans with jobs, stress, bad days, and limited mental energy - not for people whose only responsibility is looking good on Instagram.

**The Mindset Shift That Makes It Possible**

**Giving Up the ""Earned Rest"" Mentality**

I stopped believing that rest days had to be ""earned"" through previous hard workouts. Some days my body needs rest, some days my brain needs rest, and that's just part of being human.

**Accepting ""Good Enough"" as Actually Good**

Perfect is the enemy of done. A mediocre workout that actually happens is infinitely better than a perfect workout that exists only in my imagination.

The goal isn't to impress anyone or achieve peak fitness - it's to maintain a sustainable relationship with movement that enhances my life instead of stressing me out.

I'm convinced that motivation is overrated and systems are underrated, but maybe that's just me justifying my lazy approach to fitness.

**TL;DR:** Ditched motivation-based fitness for a system-based approach using minimum viable workouts, decision-free routines, clothes hacks, bribery tactics, and negotiating with my own brain. Consistency beats intensity when you're working with real human psychology instead of Instagram fantasy.",1,1758981551.0,NoFriendsFriendsClub,0,1.0,False

Our relationship was wonderful; people around us respected us, and we both loved each other very much. We had a fulfilling relationship and spent most of our time together. During the last week of our relationship, I sensed her mood was a bit low, and when I brought it up, she said she wanted to break up with me. The reason was that she no longer found me attractive. When I asked why, she said she had started to think that some things about me could never be fixed, and that's why her feelings for me had diminished. I know she's being honest, but I also know she loved me very much when we were together. I talked to her and told her I was aware of my mistakes in the relationship, then we said goodbye. We haven't spoken since that day, but yesterday he texted me. He asked if I was free this weekend, said he could return my things, and asked if I wanted to have coffee.

1nrvxdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nrvxdf/reveal_the_best_countertop_microwave_by/,Reveal the Best Countertop Microwave by Farberware Worth Buying?,"Farberware Countertop Microwave 700 Watts, model Farberware, has been part of my kitchen for a few weeks now, and I must say, my experience with it has been quite enlightening. For someone who needs a compact and functional microwave in a smaller space like an apartment, dorm, or office, this tiny yet efficient appliance might just be a lifesaver‚Äîor at least a meal saver. There are certainly aspects of this microwave that stand out beautifully, while others beg for a bit more consideration.

**Design and Size That Fit the Space Perfectly**  
I unpacked the microwave and was pleasantly surprised by its neat and compact design. At just 12.99 x 17.3 x 10.14 inches and weighing about 22.5 pounds, it‚Äôs small enough for tight kitchen counters, office break rooms, or even my cousin‚Äôs dorm table. Despite its diminutive 0.7 cubic feet capacity, I found that it fits a standard dinner plate without issue. Cleaning has been an absolute breeze thanks to the stainless-steel exterior and easy-to-wipe interior. The responsive handle adds a nice practicality, though I sometimes found myself wishing the design leaned a bit more upscale for modern kitchens.  

**Performance That Gets the Job Done**  
Everyday testing showcased the 700 watts of power working efficiently for most light tasks. Ten power levels allow adaptability for different foods, and the six one-touch buttons are convenient for quick snacks and meals. I hit the popcorn button out of curiosity and endured the suspenseful pops, eventually leading to a nice, fluffy bowl of snacky goodness. Pizza, potatoes, you name it‚Äîit handled them decently, although it seems a bit underpowered for denser foods. Defrosting by weight or time has also proven reliable, but it doesn‚Äôt surpass perfection on equally thawing bulky cuts of meat.  

**Check [Farberware Farberware] price on Amazon.**  

**Convenient Features to Make Life Easier**  
One of my favorite aspects of this microwave is the LED display with the clock and countdown timer. Whether prepping weekday meals or timing my friend‚Äôs instant coffee routine, it‚Äôs incredibly user-friendly. The interior lighting is bright enough to keep an eye on bubbling soups or melting cheese, which might sound simple but adds a layer of convenience. And yes, if you‚Äôve got curious kiddos around, the child safety lock keeps your mini-curious Georges away from the buttons‚Äîessential for peace of mind.  

**Advantages**  
This compact microwave deserves praises for certain notable aspects:  
- Thoughtful pre-set buttons for popular meals.  
- User-friendly, with bright LED lighting and a visible timer.  
- Small footprint makes it perfect for tiny kitchens, dorms, or offices.  

**Shortcomings**  
Although it has plenty to recommend, a few points stand out as less positive:  
- The 700 watts aren‚Äôt the most powerful for tackling hefty food items.  
- Its appearance may not seamlessly fit sleeker kitchen decors.  
- Lacks advanced features like inverter technology for precise cooking.  

**Challengers**  
During my search for a compact microwave, I briefly considered alternatives like the Panasonic NN-SN65KB and the Toshiba EM925A5A. Panasonic wins in raw power and inverter technology, which means smooth results for things like custards or salmon. Toshiba, on the other hand, has a classy stainless-steel finish and a bit more cooking capacity. Farberware holds its own firmly on price and compact design, making it better suited to folks with small spaces. If you‚Äôre hunting style or advanced heating mechanisms, competitors might prove better, but for simplicity, this microwave delivers.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its price, this microwave brings a lot of practicality to the table. It efficiently balances affordability with functionality, making it a great option for anyone needing a dependable, no-frills appliance. Unlike pricier alternatives, its features cover day-to-day tasks without breaking the bank. This level of budget-friendliness might make it a go-to product for students, young professionals, or anyone with space and cost constraints.

Ami sweater: The knitting is dense and the tiny embroidery is actually very neat, demonstrating excellent craftsmanship. The fabric is soft and warm to touch. A size S would provide a sleek, cozy fit that appears sharp. 9.5/10.

Cro Heart Hoodie: Print is crisp and the cotton is smooth and heavy. It's a very cozy hoodie with a nice-fitting hood. Size M provides that loose and relaxed shape I prefer. 10/10.

Who Decides War Hoodie: The material is comfortable and the graphics are original and really stand out. It feels high quality and prepared for cooler weather. A size S would provide a comfortable, standard fit that still looks laid-back. 9.5/10.

St√ºssy Sweater: This sweater has a great chunky texture to the knit and feels incredibly warm. The logo is clearly woven into the material. A size M would give a comfortably relaxed and easy fit. 9.5/10.

St√ºssy Yellow long Sleeve Shirt: The yellow is bright and the fabric is heavy but not too much. It has an awesome boxy and relaxed cut. A size M hangs very well, creating a relaxed, laid-back look. 9/10.

GALLERYDEPT Jeans: The denim is great colorwise, and the distressed finish is done properly. The fabric is heavy and feels substantial. A 30 would drape well on the waist, creating a relaxed, straight-leg fit. 10/10.

Represent Short Sleeves: The cotton for this tee is thick and structured, so it hangs beautifully. The collar is beefy and retains its shape beautifully. A size S provides a relaxed, boxy fit. 9.5/10.

Gucci baseball cap: The fabric is high quality, and the logo stitching is well clean and precise. It fits easily and has a wonderful shape. The cap is an excellent timeless piece. 10/10.

1nrvw25,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1nrvw25/reading_between_the_lines_how_to_decode/,Reading between the lines: how to decode supplement labels like a scientist!,"So after wasting embarrassing amounts of money on supplements that turned out to be overpriced placebos, I decided to learn how to actually read these labels like someone with a functioning brain instead of just trusting whatever the front of the bottle promised me.

Turns out, supplement labels are basically legal documents written in a way that's designed to confuse you while technically not lying. It's like they hired lawyers and marketers to collaborate on the most misleading truth-telling possible.

 But once you know what to look for, these labels become hilariously transparent about how useless most supplements actually are.

Here's your crash course in supplement label detective work that could save you hundreds of dollars and a lot of disappointment.

**The Front of the Bottle: Where Dreams Go to Die**

**Decoding the Meaningless Marketing Claims**

""Clinically Proven Fat Burner!"" - Translation: We found one tiny study somewhere that vaguely supports one ingredient when taken in amounts 10x higher than what's in our product.

""All Natural Weight Loss!"" - Translation: Poison ivy is also all natural. This means absolutely nothing about safety or effectiveness.

""Doctor Formulated!"" - Translation: We paid a doctor \$500 to put their name on this, or we hired someone with a doctorate in something completely unrelated to nutrition.

""Advanced Formula!"" - Translation: We changed the color of the capsules from our last version.

The front of the bottle is pure marketing fluff. The real information is hidden on the back where they hope you won't look too closely.

**The Supplement Facts Panel: Where the Truth Lives**

**Serving Size Shenanigans**

This is the first place they try to trick you. Check the serving size carefully because they love to make it seem like you're getting more than you actually are.

Example: ""1000mg of Green Coffee Bean Extract!"" sounds impressive until you realize the serving size is 4 capsules, but most people assume it's per capsule. So you're actually getting 250mg per pill, which is probably not enough to do anything.

Also watch for weird serving sizes like ""1/2 teaspoon"" for powder supplements. Nobody measures 1/2 teaspoon - they just dump some powder in water. So you're probably getting double or triple the intended dose, which might explain why you feel jittery.

**The Percent Daily Value Trick**

When you see ""2000% Daily Value"" for some B vitamin, that's not a good thing. It just means they loaded up the supplement with cheap vitamins that your body will pee out to make the label look impressive.

If there's no % Daily Value listed, that usually means there's no established need for that ingredient, which is a red flag that it might be completely unnecessary.

**Ingredient List Archaeology**

**The Order Matters More Than You Think**

Ingredients are listed in order from highest to lowest amount. So if ""Caffeine"" is the first ingredient and ""Garcinia Cambogia Extract"" is last, you're basically buying expensive caffeine pills with a sprinkle of other stuff.

I've seen ""weight loss"" supplements where the first three ingredients were just different forms of caffeine (caffeine anhydrous, green coffee extract, guarana), followed by a bunch of herbs in tiny amounts. They're selling you a \$60 energy drink in pill form.

**Spotting the Filler Parade**

Common fillers to watch out for: microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, gelatin. These aren't bad for you, but if they make up most of your ingredient list, you're paying premium prices for pill stuffing.

Quality supplements list their active ingredients first, with fillers at the end in small amounts.

**The ""Extract"" vs ""Powder"" Game**

""Green Tea Extract (50% EGCG)"" is way more potent than ""Green Tea Leaf Powder."" Extract means they concentrated the active compounds. Powder usually means they just ground up the plant and put it in a capsule.

Always look for standardized extracts with specific percentages of active compounds. If it just says ""Green Tea Leaf"" with no standardization info, you're probably getting weak tea (literally).

**The Proprietary Blend Scam Exposed**

**Why ""Proprietary Blends"" Are Legal Theft**

This is the biggest red flag on any supplement label. When you see ""Proprietary Fat Burning Blend - 500mg"" followed by a list of 10 ingredients, they're legally allowed to hide how much of each ingredient is actually in there.

Here's what usually happens: 450mg of that blend is caffeine (which costs pennies), and the remaining 50mg is split between 9 other ingredients in amounts too small to do anything. But they can still list all 10 ingredients like they're meaningful.

If a company won't tell you exactly how much of each ingredient you're getting, it's because those amounts would disappoint you.

**The Magic Fairy Dust Dosing**

I call this ""pixie dusting"" - when companies include trendy ingredients in amounts so small they might as well not be there, just so they can put them on the label.

Example: A fat burner might contain 2mg of forskolin when effective studies used 250mg. They can still say ""Contains Forskolin!"" but you'd need to take 125 capsules to get a research-backed dose.

**Decoding the Fine Print**

**The Sneaky Disclaimer Section**

""This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA"" - This is required by law and basically means ""we can say whatever we want about this product because nobody's checking our claims.""

""Results not typical"" - Translation: The success stories we show you are cherry-picked outliers that most people won't experience.

""Individual results may vary"" - Translation: This probably won't work for you, but we needed legal cover for our marketing claims.

**Expiration Date Reality Check**

Supplements can lose potency over time, especially if they contain probiotics, enzymes, or oil-based ingredients. If there's no expiration date or it's printed so lightly you can barely read it, that's suspicious.

Also, if you're buying supplements from a discount store where they might have been sitting in a hot warehouse for months, the active ingredients might be degraded even if they're not technically expired.

**The Research Citation Red Flags**

**How to Spot Fake Science**

When supplements claim to be ""research-backed,"" here's how to verify:

- Look for actual study citations (not just ""clinical studies show..."")
- Check if the studies used the same dosage that's in the supplement
- See who funded the research (company-funded studies are automatically suspicious)
- Look up the study size (12 people for 2 weeks isn't meaningful)

Most supplement companies count on you not actually looking up their research. When you do, it's usually disappointing.

**The Correlation vs. Causation Shell Game**

""Studies show people who take \[ingredient\] weigh less!"" But correlation isn't causation. Maybe people who take expensive supplements also eat better and exercise more. The supplement might have nothing to do with their weight loss.

**Dosage Reality Checks**

**Comparing to Successful Studies**

Before buying any supplement, look up what dosages were used in studies that actually showed positive results. You'll often find that effective doses are way higher than what's in commercial supplements.

Example: Ashwagandha studies typically use 300-600mg daily. If your supplement only has 50mg, don't expect the same results as the research.

**The ""Mega Dose"" Marketing Trap**

Sometimes companies go the opposite direction and include massive doses to make their product seem more powerful. But more isn't always better - your body can only absorb so much of most nutrients, and excess amounts often just get wasted.

Plus, mega-dosing can sometimes be dangerous or cause side effects that the company conveniently doesn't mention.

**Quality Indicators to Look For**

**Third-Party Testing**

Look for seals from organizations like NSF, USP, or ConsumerLab. These mean an independent company verified that what's on the label is actually in the bottle.

Supplements without third-party testing could contain completely different amounts than listed, or even different ingredients entirely.

**Manufacturing Standards**

""GMP Certified"" (Good Manufacturing Practices) is the bare minimum for supplement manufacturing. It's not impressive, it's just basic quality control that should be standard.

Look for more specific certifications and avoid companies that don't mention their manufacturing standards at all.

**Red Flag Ingredients to Avoid**

**The ""Kitchen Sink"" Approach**

When a supplement contains 25+ ingredients, it's usually a sign that none of them are in effective doses. Quality supplements focus on a few ingredients in proper amounts rather than throwing everything at the wall.

**Banned or Questionable Substances**

Some supplements still contain ingredients that have been banned or linked to serious side effects. Always Google unfamiliar ingredient names before taking them.

If the ingredient list looks like a chemistry textbook and you can't pronounce half the names, maybe reconsider.

**The Bottom Line**

After learning to read labels properly, I realized that about 90% of supplements are either overpriced versions of basic nutrients you can get from food, or collections of under-dosed ingredients that won't do anything meaningful.

The few supplements that might actually be worth buying are usually the boring ones with simple, transparent labels that don't make wild claims.

Once you start seeing through the marketing tricks, it's hard to believe you ever fell for this stuff.

**TL;DR:** Supplement labels hide the truth behind proprietary blends, misleading serving sizes, fake research claims, and marketing fluff.

1nrvvhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1nrvvhe/explore_if_the_brother_ads1300_scanner_is_worth/,Explore if the Brother ADS-1300 Scanner is Worth the Hype,"Testing out the Brother ADS-1300 Compact Desktop Scanner in real life turned out to be a surprisingly delightful experience. This scanner is compact but comes fully loaded, designed for home or office use. In my setup, where desk space is always at a premium, this scanner felt like it was purpose-built for someone like me. It‚Äôs not much bigger than a shoebox, and at just about 3 pounds, I could move it effortlessly from my desk to the coffee table when I needed room for other gear. Mentioning its design would be incomplete without noting the clean black finish and intuitive layout, giving it both a sleek and practical vibe.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

Setting up the scanner was refreshingly painless. As someone not particularly excited about fiddling with drivers, I was relieved that plugging it into my laptop via the included USB-C cable had it ready to go in no time. There wasn‚Äôt a need for additional power cables cluttering my already chaotic workspace, which instantly won me over. The Brother ADS-1300 can handle more than you‚Äôd expect for its size: it powers through photos, receipts, legal-size documents, and even ID cards with its nifty card slot feature. For instance, I tried scanning some business cards I picked up from a recent conference, and the process was quick and seamless.

**Quality and Speed**

A standout feature here is definitely its speed. The capability to scan 30 pages per minute felt almost magical, especially since the scanner processes both sides of the document in a single pass. Imagine sitting there with a 20-page document‚Äîthanks to the 20-page automatic document feeder‚Äîand having it digitized before your coffee gets cold. Not bad, right? The scan quality also deserves a nod, with resolutions up to 600 x 600 dpi. My old family photos looked crisp once scanned, although older, stained papers required minor adjustments post-scan.

[Check Brother ADS-1300 price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b0d1t3sn8b/)

**Software and Functionality**

The included software bundle considerably stretches the scanner‚Äôs functionality. Between iPrint&Scan for managing files, Kofax PaperPort for converting scans into editable PDFs, and Power PDF for document organization, you‚Äôve got serious tools for office tasks or personal archiving projects. I found the OCR feature particularly useful, as it made text-heavy scans searchable. That being said, some Mac users (my colleague included) reported occasional hiccups with software compatibility, which seems like something Brother could iron out.

**Good Aspects**

- Great compact design fitting into tight spaces
- Fast scanning speeds that save time
- Handles a wide range of document types effectively
- Convenient card slot for smaller tasks
- Powered directly via USB-C, reducing cord clutter

**Hurdles**

- Occasional software issues with specific operating systems
- Limited to 20 pages in its automatic feeder
- High-speed scanning sometimes leads to very subtle alignment errors on thicker documents  

**Product Rivals**

When considering alternatives, you might stumble across competitors like the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1300 or the Epson RapidReceipt RR-70W. Fujitsu‚Äôs product gives similar quick speeds and a compact build while excelling in document organization features. However, its price point tends to sit higher. Epson's option brings wireless capabilities into the mix, which the Brother ADS-1300 lacks. That said, none of these competitors match the simplicity of plugging the ADS-1300 in and going to town immediately. The Brother seems particularly well-suited for users caught between wanting a feature-packed scanner without veering into cumbersome tech territory.

**Budget-Friendly**

Considering the range of features and performance the ADS-1300 brings to the table, its value proposition feels pretty high. It stands as a happy compromise between budget constraints and advanced functionality. While some pricier models throw in wireless connections or XL size feeders, this scanner keeps it minimal yet power-packed. Whether for daily office runs or the occasional need to unclutter mountainous paper piles at home, you‚Äôre looking at a product punching well above its weight.

I prefer a light roast, which has a less strong flavor but is more caffeinated.

French coffees all seem to be marketed with an ""intensity"" grade (1-9, as far as I can tell), but after 6 years of living here I still can't seem to understand what this number refers to. A coffee ""doux"" (low intensity) seems to correspond to a light roast, and a dark roast seems to be usually described as ""intense."" But these qualities don't always correspond to the ""intensity number"" on the package.

Can someone explain to me exactly what the difference between a ""3"" coffee and an ""8"" coffee is? Just a matter of flavor? Is it the counter-intuitive case, as I suspect, that the lower-""intensity"" coffees actually have more caffeine, because they tend to have a lighter roast?

My last relationship was two years ago and since then, I've been out of the dating scene due to my career and fear of another messy breakup. I don't have much social media either, and being a workaholic and natural homebody, I'm not really going to bars.

Ive come to the conclusion that I need to get myself out there and try this again. I'm really looking for real companionship and love. 

Some stuff about me: I'm 32, white, 5'8"", long dark curly hair, dark blue eyes and wear glasses. I take care of myself and have impeccable hygiene. I work out four times a week and keep myself in really good shape. Been told by many that I'm handsome. Personality wise, I'm pretty quiet and reserved, with some nerdy interests and topics I can blab about under the right circumstances.

I work in Manhattan for a well known tech company and currently live in Suffolk County. Well off financially and also financially savvy. I trade stocks often and have made a healthy nestegg for myself. I live on my own in a condo.

Hobbies wise I'm into a lot to keep busy. I'm a tech nerd and like to build computers and play PC games. I love RPGs, FPS games, some moba stuff (recently got into Deadlock) and others. I love vintage electronics, especially stereo equipment and old computers. I am also a big music fan who listens to just about everything (rap, r&b, rock, metal, classics, some jazz). I repair electronics as a hobby and enjoy restoring equipment when I can. I love to cook, making myself meal prep, and would love to cook you a delicious meal for a date night. I'm also an avid reader, I love sci-fi, some fantasy and non fiction. Currently collecting tons of books and vinyl records. Big on thrifting in general.

I'm looking for the following:

25-35, Woman, height/weight proportional (sorry, not into bigger women). Financially independent. Beautiful in your own way and confident to offset my shyness is a huge plus. Located in NYC or Long Island. Looking for someone to grow with and trying for long term. Some similar interests and hobbies would be great,  but I'm happy with chill vibes on the couch, watching a TV or movie while cuddling... Dinner and Movie Dates are lovely as well. Not looking for someone celibate or experiencing low libido, I am respectful of not rushing but  I'm not looking for a dead bedroom situation.

Send me a chat here if you're interested. Please send a picture at some point and will do the same. Happy to arrange a date or to grab coffee before taking anything further. ",1,1758981249.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

How do I know this stuff? Because I used to work in supplement marketing for 3 years, and let me tell you - the stuff I saw behind the scenes would make you never trust a fat burner ad again.

I'm talking about psychological manipulation tactics that are so effective, even people who KNOW they're being manipulated still fall for them. These companies have turned selling hope into a science, and most of us are walking around completely defenseless against their strategies.

Time to level the playing field.

**The ""Transformation Photo"" Scam That Fooled Me for Years**

**The Before/After Manufacturing Process**

Those dramatic transformation photos? Half of them are complete BS, and the other half are intentionally misleading. Here's how they actually work:

For ""before"" photos: Take the picture right after a big meal, bad lighting, slouched posture, no tan, sometimes even after deliberately gaining weight for a few weeks.

For ""after"" photos: Dehydrate for 2-3 days, perfect lighting, flexed pose, professional photographer, maybe a spray tan. Oh, and - sometimes the ""after"" photo is taken FIRST, then they gain weight for the ""before"" shot.

I've literally seen companies hire the same fitness models to create multiple fake transformation stories. Same person, different lighting and poses, completely different ""customer testimonial.""

**The Timeline Lie**

""Lost 30 pounds in 30 days!"" Except what they don't tell you is that 25 of those pounds were water weight from a crash diet, and the person gained it all back within a week of stopping the supplement.

The most effective transformations they show are from people who completely changed their diet and exercise routine while taking the supplement, but the marketing implies the pill did all the work.

**The Ingredient Label Wizardry**

**Proprietary Blend = Legal Scam**

This one makes me so angry. When you see ""proprietary blend"" on a label, it means they can list a bunch of ingredients without telling you how much of each one is actually in there.

So they'll put 1000mg of ""Fat Burning Proprietary Blend"" that contains caffeine, green tea extract, and 15 other ingredients. But here's the trick - 950mg of that blend could just be caffeine, with tiny, useless amounts of everything else. You're paying premium prices for caffeine pills with a sprinkle of random herbs.

**The ""Clinically Studied"" Word Games**

""Clinically proven to burn fat!"" But when you dig into the actual studies (which 99% of people never do), you find out:

- The study was done on 12 people for 2 weeks
- The results showed a 0.5 pound difference vs placebo
- The study was funded by the company selling the supplement
- Participants also changed their diet and exercise routine

Technically ""clinically studied"" but absolutely meaningless in real life.

**Mega-Dosing Useless Ingredients**

They'll load up supplements with huge amounts of cheap ingredients that sound impressive but do basically nothing for weight loss. Like 5000% of your daily vitamin B12. Sounds amazing until you realize excess B vitamins just get peed out, and B12 doesn't burn fat anyway.

It's all about making the label look impressive to people who don't know better.

**The Psychological Manipulation Tactics**

**Scarcity and Urgency Fake-Outs**

""Only 3 bottles left!"" ""Sale ends in 24 hours!"" ""Limited time offer!"" I can't tell you how many times I've seen these same ""limited time"" offers running for months. It's all fake urgency designed to make you buy impulsively before you have time to research or think it through.

Pro tip: If you see urgency tactics, wait a week and check back. I guarantee that ""limited time"" offer will still be there.

**The Authority Figure Exploitation**

""Doctor recommended!"" ""Celebrity endorsed!"" Here's what they don't tell you: that ""doctor"" might be a chiropractor with no nutrition training, and that ""celebrity endorsement"" was probably just a paid Instagram post where the celebrity never actually used the product.

They bank on the fact that most people won't verify credentials or dig deeper into these claims.

**The Community Manipulation**

Fake Facebook groups, paid testimonials, bot reviews - they create entire fake communities around their products. I've seen companies pay people to join weight loss Facebook groups and casually mention their supplements in conversations.

Those ""real customer"" reviews on their websites? Often written by the marketing team. Those before/after posts in Facebook groups? Sometimes paid actors.

**The Science-y Sounding Nonsense**

**Metabolic Pathway Word Salad**

""Activates thermogenesis through mitochondrial uncoupling proteins!"" Sounds super scientific, right? It's basically meaningless marketing speak designed to confuse you into thinking they know something you don't.

They throw around real scientific terms in completely wrong contexts, betting that you won't have a PhD in biochemistry to call them out on it.

**The Cherry-Picked Research Game**

They'll find one tiny study that shows their ingredient doing something vaguely related to weight loss, then extrapolate that into claims about their specific product.

Like, ""Green coffee bean extract shown to increase fat oxidation!"" Based on a study where people took 10x the amount that's actually in the supplement, under completely different conditions.

**The Subscription Trap People Fall For**

**The ""Free Trial"" That Costs \$200**

""Just pay shipping!"" Then two weeks later you're automatically charged \$89.95 for a monthly subscription you didn't knowingly sign up for. The cancellation process involves calling during business hours and arguing with retention specialists trained to make canceling as difficult as possible.

I watched companies make millions from people who forgot to cancel these ""free"" trials.

**The Escalating Commitment Strategy**

First they get you to try one supplement. Then they email about how much better results you'll get if you add their pre-workout. Then their post-workout recovery formula. Before you know it, you're spending \$300/month on a stack of supplements that probably do less than a basic multivitamin.

**What Actually Works (Spoiler: It's Boring)**

After seeing behind the curtain, here's what I learned actually helps with weight loss:

- Caffeine (but you can get this from coffee for way cheaper)
- Protein powder (if you're not getting enough protein from food)
- A basic multivitamin (only if your diet sucks)
- Fiber supplements (only if you don't eat vegetables)

That's literally it. Everything else is either overpriced versions of these basics or complete marketing nonsense.

**How to Protect Yourself**

**The BS Detection Questions**

Before buying any supplement, ask:

- Who funded the studies they're citing?
- What were the actual results (not just ""clinically proven"")?
- How much of each ingredient is actually in here?
- Why can't I get these same benefits from real food?
- If this worked as advertised, wouldn't obesity be solved by now?

**The 48-Hour Rule**

Never buy supplements impulsively. Give yourself 48 hours to research and think it over. Most of the time, the desire to buy will pass once you're not being actively marketed to.

**Research the Company, Not Just the Product**

Look up the company's BBB rating, search for complaints, check how long they've been in business. Sketchy supplement companies often rebrand and disappear when they get too many complaints.

**The Real Talk About Supplements**

The supplement industry is worth \$50+ billion a year, and most of it is built on selling hope to people who are frustrated with their weight. These companies know that people want a magic solution, and they're very good at making their products seem like that solution.

The truth is, there is no magic pill. The most effective ""supplement"" for weight loss is eating less food and moving more, but you can't patent that and sell it for \$89.95 a bottle.

**Anyone else fallen for supplement marketing tricks? What were the red flags you wish you'd noticed earlier?** I think sharing these stories helps everyone get better at spotting the BS before they waste their money.

**TL;DR:** Supplement companies use fake transformation photos, misleading science claims, psychological manipulation, subscription traps, and proprietary blends to sell overpriced caffeine pills.

#**Monastic Outpost 50x50**

Tucked away in the parched landscape, the Monastic Outpost is part walled town, part pilgrimage, part trading post and part a place to escape from your past.

Making your way past the gatehouses, you‚Äôll notice immediately that the magnificent Cathedral of the Lady Bones dominates, tended to by Her Monastic Order (living very sparsely in the monastic building behind the Cathedral), but pilgrims can stay in a little more luxury at the local doss-house. There‚Äôs a tavern (with private dining), some market stalls for a little light shopping, a smithy for repairs or new goods, and of course any traders will want to register at the Overseer‚Äôs Office before making use of the warehousing facilities.

Noble Phantasm 1 | I simply believe. That is my...**""Batt≈ç: Kamui (Divine Might)""**!  
Noble Phantasm 2 | This is...the blade of divine might! There is nothing I can not cut.  
Noble Phantasm 3 | The sword stroke that I must swing. Now is the time for it. **""Batt≈ç: Kamui""**!  
Noble Phantasm 4 | If you force the unreasonable through, reason will also be pushed aside. **""Batt≈ç: Kamui""**!

Damaged 2 | Kuh...!  
Damaged 3 | Nuaah!  
Damaged 4 | Hah!  
Defeat 1 | I won't...break...  
Defeat 2 | I won't...die yet...  
Defeat 3 | My mana...won't last...  
Defeat 4 | I'm...hungry...  
Victory 1 | My apologies. I got absentminded and cut down too many.  
Victory 2 | It's over with this, right.  
Victory 3 | They gave me more trouble than expected. Next time, I'll kill them swiftly.  
Victory 4 | Are you okay? I see, good.  
Level up 1 | Thank you for the meal...this is...quite hard...  
Level up 2 | Affection makes one stronger. Thank you.    
Level up 3 | I'm in great condition. Please keep this coming.  
Bond 1 | ""Pit Viper Gensai""? It's not like I called myself that. How rude of people to do as they please and give me some weird nickname. And to think it would be recorded in history, it's just the worst.  
Bond 2 | I can cut anything. I'm not lying. I lived my life believing that. You're not living your life having given up either, are you? It's the same thing.  
Bond 3 | I have confidence in my skill with the sword, and I believe I'm suited for the Saber-class, but I always get summoned as an Assassin for some reason. Even though I shouldn't be suited for it since I'm bad at Presence Concealment and my fuel consumption is also poor...I'm at the point where I just want to go and question that Holy Grail thing on what it's thinking.  
Bond 4 | It's strange...my contract with you feels just right. Being told this by a manslayer like me must be worrying. I know, can you hold my hand for a bit? Yes, like that, grasp it tight. It really is strange. It's very comforting and makes me warm inside. Could this be what they call the red thread of fate...I'm sorry, forget what I said. Actually, no, you don't need to forget it or anything.  
Bond 5 | I did not wield the sword I should have and ended up wielding the one that I shouldn't have. Since then, for reasons unknown to me, I became unable to cut down people. Like that, having lost my sword, I was swallowed up by the waves of the times and died. That me became a Servant and I'm swinging a sword again. I understand now. I think I've found the sword I am meant to wield. That's right, I'm sure I have come here for the sake of meeting you.  
Dialogue 1 | Are you going? Then I'll come with you. Eh? We'll stand out? Apologies, but Presence Concealment is not my strong suit. I'll have you let me accompany you boldly.  
Dialogue 2 | I'm not too interested in master-servant relationships, but if you believe in my sword, then I don't mind it. I don't mean to boast, but people don't really believe in me.  
Dialogue 3 | It's hard to put it into words, but it doesn't feel like I'm meeting Master for the first time. I don't know how to put it, but it feels like we've fought together numerous times, but also like we haven't...it's strange.  
Dialogue 4 | Okita S≈çji...my connection with her is...superficial. To be honest, we just faced each other once, that's all. It's just that I won't stay silent if others were to claim that she is the strongest swordsman of the Bakumatsu period. I'm looking forward to the hosting of a Bakumatsu Olympics. **(If you have Saber Okita S≈çji)**  
Dialogue 5 | Enjaku Batt≈çjustu...the fastest, briefest and smallest iai. As a fellow iai user, she is to be respected. Her making me delicious rice balls also deserves extra-great respect. **(If you have Benienma)**  
Dialogue 6 | Shinsaku...? Aah, I've never gotten along with him. I don't even want to meet him, but he'd keep arguing with me wherever I went. It's literally what you'd call a rotten relationship^[1] . In any case, he's the epitome of someone who can not be trusted. **(If you have Takasugi Shinsaku)**  
Dialogue 7 | I don't remember ever targeting Sakamoto, but I'm shocked there was someone who could kill him. See, that odd woman who always followed him around seemed like she'd be tiring to cut down. If someone was able to kill him regardless of that, then they were either incredibly lucky or it was a boon of malice. **(If you have any version of Sakamoto Ry≈çma)**  
Dialogue 8 | So that's the Old Man of the Mountain, King Hassan...based on his atmosphere and that great sword, even I can tell that he is someone extraordinary. Actually, didn't he get assigned the Assassin-class by mistake and should be a Saber instead? Though that goes for me as well. **(If you have King Hassan)**  
Likes | I like eating. Or more like, I was always troubled by how quickly I got hungry. It's quit inconvenient how harsh my mana expenditure is after becoming a Servant.    
Dislikes | I wouldn't say I dislike it, but talking during a meal is hard for me. I'm not saying I dislike talking; it's just that I'm so hyper-focused on eating that I can't think that clearly.  
Holy Grail | I want the Grail. However, I'm not quite sure why. There should have been something I wished for, but it's like my head is enveloped in a fog, and I can't recall what my wish was.  
Event | An event? If there is an opportunity for me to wield my sword there, then leave it to me. Even if there isn't, we can also just go around buying food, so I'll be looking forward to it either way.  
Birthday | I hear it's your birthday today. I'll treat you to a meal then. Don't worry, I'll have some food as well. This way we'll both be happy and can have some fun.  
Summoning | I'm Saber, Kawakami Gen- eh? Assassin...?  Nobody told me that. Wait a bit, let me redo my introduction...I'm Assassin, Kawakami Gensai. I have come in response to your summons. While my only redeeming feature would be cutting people down, conversely, I can cut down anyone and anything, so I don't mind if you rely on me... ...? For some reason, it doesn't feel like I'm meeting you for the first time.  

Kawakami Gensai (Ascension 2) [CV: Shiraishi Haruka] | |  
:----------------|---------------  
Battle Start 1 | Troublesome guests will simply be cut down and thrown aside.  
Battle Start 2 | Welcome. I'll cut you down in a second.  
Battle Start 3 | This appearance is a disguise meant to conceal me from the world. You'd better not underestimate me.   
Battle Start 4 | Sorry to keep you waiting. You want me to cut that one down, right?  
Skill 1 | I'll treat you roughly.  
Skill 2 | Don't underestimate a maid.    
Skill 3 | I wish for your safe return home.  
Skill 4 | Go ahead and place your order.  
Skill 5 | What a cute customer.

Noble Phantasm Card Selected 1 | Is that what you'll order?  
Noble Phantasm Card Selected 2 | Wait a bit, I'll get it ready.  
Noble Phantasm Card Selected 3 | Seems like I've got no choice.  
Noble Phantasm Card Selected 4 | I'll clean them up right away.  
Attack 1 | Apologies for dropping in from above.  
Attack 2 | Hah!  
Attack 3 | I won't let you!  
Attack 4 | Maid Nagi (Maid Lull)!  
Attack 5 | There!  
Attack 6 | I'll split you apart!  
Attack 7 | Got you!  
Attack 8 | Ageoroshi (Ebb and Flow)!  
Attack 9 | Tei! Yaah!  
Attack 10 | Apologies for passing through from below.  
Attack 11 | Stop making a fuss.  
Attack 12 | I'll chop you into fine pieces!  
Attack 13 | I'll carve you up.  
Attack 14 | Tobashi Nagi (Flying Lull)!  
Attack 15 | Here's a freebie.    
Extra Attack 1 | Complaints...will not be accepted!  
Extra Attack 2 | Maid Batt≈ç...Oroshi Nagi!  
Extra Attack 3 | No...free returns!  
Extra Attack 4 | With this...shop's closed for today!  
Noble Phantasm 1 | The enemies of my master...will be all cut down! Maid Batt≈ç: Kamui!  
Noble Phantasm 2 | Let me send you off to the afterlife with this sword stroke. **""Batt≈ç: Kamui""**!  
Noble Phantasm 3 | With a swing of my sword, I'll cut down the principles of the world! Maid Batt≈ç: Kamui!  
Noble Phantasm 4 | Dear customer, it is time to close the store. Please, hurry up and return...to the underworld!  
Damaged 1 | It's not working on me...! It's...not...!  
Damaged 2 | Kyaah!  
Damaged 3 | This is...a bit...!  
Damaged 4 | Tch...!  
Defeat 1 | This will...get me fired, huh...  
Defeat 2 | Sorry...I'll be finishing early...  
Defeat 3 | I'll...clean up after myself...  
Defeat 4 | So I really am...not suited for this...?  
Victory 1 | Those returning should come this way. Yes, towards the Sanzu River.  
Victory 2 | Here's your gift. Yes, for the afterlife.  
Victory 3 | With this, the shop is closed for today. Should I pour you some coffee?  
Victory 4 | Don't think you can return safely after bearing your fangs towards the master.  
Level up 1 | I'll rest a little. Phew.  
Level up 2 | Power is swelling up inside me. If I could have some rice balls, it would be even better.  
Level up 3 | These are like big konpeit≈ç.    
Ascension 1 | What do you think? I tried changing into clothes matching the latest fashion. Eh? ""If anything, this is the outfit of a maid""? I don't really get it, but I like how that sounds so I don't mind.  
Ascension 2 | It's alright. I'll earn my own food expenses. Don't worry, worst case-scenario, I'll just find some thugs and take their money. Let's see, bounty hunting could also be an option.  
Bond 1 | My memories are a mess right now so could we leave this for later? No, it's not like I've come to dislike you or anything. I'm just thinking about what to do from now on.  
Bond 2 | I see. So that's what it was. No, it's something unrelated to you. Pay it no mind. I'll keep being your ally from now on as well. Forever.  
Bond 3 | At any rate, I want you to get the Holy Grail. For your sake and mine as well. We'll start with that. To achieve that, I'll do anything so no need to hold back.  
Bond 4 | Why did I choose these clothes? Let's see. The current age does not seem to be one where a manslayer can put food on the table so I thought it'd be better to learn a vocation. Also, if the husband is unable to earn money, the wife has to do it in his place and support the household. Helping each other is what life's about...Sorry. Just what am I talking about, I wonder.  
Bond 5 | I'm sure I must have met someone similar to you somewhere. I don't remember clearly, but the feeling alone that I spent time with a person who had a heart similar to yours is certainly there. I'm sorry for saying something strange all of a sudden. I may never come to understand this. or perhaps something will cause me to do so. It would be nice if the time I understood came one day, though.  
Dialogue 1 | Are you going outside, master? Then please, leave clearing the way to me. I'll cut down anyone who gets in your way so be at ease.  
Dialogue 2 | The master-servant relationship? Seeing this outfit, you should be aware. The current me is a remarkable maid swordsman serving her master. I can do anything, be it preparing tea or fighting battles, my master.  
Dialogue 3 | Master...no, in this outfit, maybe I should call you my master...apologies. Even though I said it myself, I got a bit embarrassed.  
Dialogue 4 | So that is the Land of the Fae's strongest maid, Barghest. I'm not gonna say in terms of what, but she is overwhelming, as expected. Hey, make sure you don't get captivated either. I'm not gonna say by what. **(If you have Swimsuit Barghest)**  
Dialogue 5 | My blade? It's D≈çtanuki Munehiro. For a one-handed batt≈ç user like me, it fits perfectly in my hand and I'm quite fond of it too. Also, etiquette dictates that a maid should have a blade, no?  
Dialogue 6 | Ry≈çgi...Shiki...I've never heard her name before, but I can tell from the way she holds herself. She's a considerable expert. Also, that outfit, so that's a modern swimsuit...her bunny ears are wonderful. **(If you have Swimsuit Shiki)**  
Likes | My favorite? From the modern age, let's see, I like iced coffee. In particular, enjoying it during the afternoon break is my favorite. I even add ice cream to it.  
Dislikes | Something I dislike? I'm not that great with spicy food. But I like curry rice. Restaurants have sweet curry, after all.  
Holy Grail | The Holy Grail? My personal wish would be a store. I want to open a coffee shop once I retire, after all. I'd cut down bad guys occasionally.  
Event | An event? Perfect timing. Let's open a stall to make some profit. The more working capital we have the better.  
Birthday | Today's your birthday, right? Instead of a gift, I'll stay with you for the whole day and take care of you. Does that make you happy? I see, I'm happy to hear that.

Victory 1 | One mind and one meaning. Feelings surpass everything.  
Victory 2 | This is my, that is, Gensai's, sword.  
Victory 3 | My sword is with my master.  
Victory 4 | I got a bit overenthusiastic. If you could hand me some rice balls, that would be a great help.  
Level up 1 | I feel good. You can expect much from me.  
Level up 2 | This would be easier to eat if we put them inside rice balls.  
Level up 3 | Let us rise even higher.  
Ascension 3 | In this form, I can feel your mana flowing into my body. I see, for this power, with you, I... Indeed, I'll be having you allow me to wield my blade as much as I please.  
Ascension 4 | I lived and died searching for the answer to what my sword was meant to cut. Even after I was summoned to the Throne and became a Servant, I kept wandering as I sought the answer. However, my sword did not exist to cut something. Yes, my sword was there to be wielded when the right time came for it. There was no way I could find it. After all, the order was reversed. Yes, the answer was right there from the start. That's why, let me wield my blade for your sake, now, in this moment.  
Bond 1 | My sword is D≈çtanuki Munehiro. My style is self-taught. No one can imitate me. This exists only to let me wield my own blade, after all.  
Bond 2 | From what angle would one need to look at me to mistake me for a man? Even if I were to change my appearance a little, it would be obvious I'm a woman, no? Here, take a good look...no, wait, you don't need to bring your face so close.  
Bond 3 | I admit that for an Assassin, my mana expenditure is great and my fuel consumption is poor. To tell the truth, I'm also bad at Presence Concealment. However, in return, I'll show you skills with a sword that won't lose out to even that of a Saber. Good grief, honestly, if I were just summoned as a Saber, there wouldn't even be a need to say this.  
Bond 4 | In search of the sword I was meant to wield, I have wandered through many destinies and made it here. In the world I've arrived to through such a process, I swing the sword I'm meant to wield. That is how I, the Servant called Gensai, live. If I swing the sword I'm supposed to wield, I'll simply drift away without knowing where I'll end up once again. But, yes, this time, I feel like overstaying a little.  
Bond 5 | I came to you for the sake of wielding this sword. That's why I'm sure I won't be able to stay here once your fight is over. My fate is to drift away once again to the place where this sword is meant to be swung. That's surely how my existence as a Heroic Spirit is like. But, for some reason, there is something I know. At a place different from here, in a different period, with a different you...yes, there, I will surely meet you again.  
Dialogue 1 | A sortie? Then let us be off. I'm unable to conceal myself, so I'll accompany you in the open.  
Dialogue 2 | The master-servant relationship? Serving someone is not really my strong suit. I just swing my sword where I am meant to be. Right now, that place is here.  
Dialogue 3 | I am your Servant. I will cut down anyone who'd impede you. That's all.    
Dialogue 4 | Manslayer Iz≈ç...Setting aside his intelligence, or perhaps we should say it's precisely because of that, but his swordsmanship is truly impressive. However, even with those eyes, he can not see through my batt≈ç that cuts through logic itself. I'm serious, you know? **(If you have Okada Iz≈ç)**  
Dialogue 5 | So you are that renowned Sasaki Kojir≈ç-dono. I would love to witness your skill with your famed long sword by all means. The sword you perfected by continuing to swing it in singleminded devotion...huh? You were also swinging a hoe? Could you please tell me more in detail!? **(If you have Sasaki Kojir≈ç)**  
Dialogue 6 | That's Miyamoto...Musashi... For her to appear in a swimsuit was beyond my expectations. To think she won multiple duels in that outfit. Should I say it's expected? She is not a master swordsman of average intellect. Aah, so the swimsuit is just because it was Summer? **(If you have Swimsuit Musashi)**  
Likes | Something I like...Since coming here, I've had many delicious dishes, but, sure enough, rice balls might still be my favorite.  
Dislikes | I wouldn't go as far as to say I dislike it, but look, I'm wearing clothes like this, right? I don't like having to be careful with food splatters when I eat. I want to eat my meals in comfort.  
Holy Grail | A wish for the Holy Grail...I don't need it right now, but when the time comes for me to leave this place, I'd be happy if you could spare me one. After all, this world's version of you have plenty of them, right?  
Event | I've heard they're holding an event or something, so let's go have a look. It's okay, being a bodyguard is not my forte, but if I cut them down in advance, the result's the same.  
Birthday | Today's your birthday, right, Master? Look at this extra-large birthday cake I prepared especially for this occasion. Yes, I ordered it from the internet. What was it called again? I think it was a wedding or something cake. Anyway, it was large and seemed worth eating. Fufu, now then, let me cut it into pieces for you.  
  
Dialogue for Gensai from other Servants | |  
:----------------|---------------  
Takasugi Shinsaku | Hey, hey, here I was thinking who you'd summoned, but it was that Pit Viper Gensai of all people? Are you out of your mind? Once that woman sets her eyes on you, she'll chase you around until you die. What? Are we acquaintances, you ask? Quit joking. Me and a person like that being acquaintances? ...Well, we are.  
Nagakura Shinpachi | Hey, hey!? Is that Manslayer Gensai by any chance!? ...No, it's not like I care who you summon, but I'm amazed and your foolhardiness! ...Nah, that's not it, is it. This just means you're of such caliber that even *that* Gensai deemed you worthy of dedicating her sword to you.  
Okita S≈çji | Manslayer Gensai...indeed, her skill with the sword is anything but ordinary. If we were to fight each other seriously, one of us would definitely die... Putting that aside, isn't that person actings strangely overfamiliar with Master for some reason!? How do I put it...no, I don't mean anything weird by it, nothing werid at all...!

I recently bought the Ninja Luxe 501 about 4 weeks ago. I usually run one or two espressos without coffee before pulling a shot to flush it through. Up until now that worked fine, but lately I‚Äôve noticed something odd.

When I run it empty, there‚Äôs a big layer of water left sitting in the portafilter that doesn‚Äôt get pressed through. At the same time, my coffee always tastes a bit acidic. I‚Äôve tried adjusting the water temperature and grinding the beans finer, but that hasn‚Äôt fixed it.

All throughout school, college and afterwards. We have a group chat of us and another friend that has been the place we talk constantly, vent about whatever problems come up and support one another for the past 5 years. 

I lived abroad for a couple of years until recently and the other friend was also abroad for over a year. Ive been back home several times a year. During that time the friend in question became pregnant unexpectedly while broken up with the baby‚Äôs father (back together now) and both of her parents have been sick with cancer. Her mom got diagnosed while we were abroad. They‚Äôre doing well but not in remission. For context, she‚Äôs the first of our friend group to have a baby. 

The other friend and I don‚Äôt like her boyfriend, he is the last in a string of uncaring, selfish dickheads who she seems to always go for. He talks down to her constantly but she always goes back to him. We are always very careful about not being too direct about these feelings with her because we don‚Äôt want to push her away. It‚Äôs been sad seeing her accept such low levels of appreciation from the father of her child. We‚Äôve listened to her over the years when he‚Äôs let her down but eventually she just stopped talking about him in our group chat. 

She barely sees friends anymore, can‚Äôt leave the baby overnight or even go out for an entire evening. He hasn‚Äôt bonded with the child as they don‚Äôt live together so everything falls on her. They have broken up and gotten back together on multiple occasions and myself and friend 2 in the group have noticed a pattern of her becoming distant when they are back together and then being more engaged when they‚Äôre not. 

Over the past few years I have had a lot of struggles with my job and mental health. There have been times where I‚Äôve said some pretty dark things about not wanting to be here into our group chat and have sent multiple messages about arguments with family that she just ignores. On one occasion there was a week of very serious things I was saying that she ignored only to pop back in a week later sending photos of her vacation. 

She has done the same to our other friend who has been talking about serious health issues and other serious family matters. One night where I was really struggling and the other friend didn‚Äôt have cell service she ignored my messages. We went for coffee with other friends the next day and I was honest about how I was feeling mentally with them, she knew what she did was wrong because she then felt the need to tell me sorry for not replying she was putting the baby to bed. Despite this she has done the same thing on multiple occasions since and has even been said how heartbroken she felt about suicides she‚Äôs heard about in the community. It angered me. 

She only seems to respond if we intentionally ask her a question directly or if she does respond her replies are really lacklustre or honestly bizarre e.g. ‚Äòwhy are you depressed?‚Äô She hasn‚Äôt asked us to do anything either as a group or 1:1 probably in 2 years but we see each other when we are with our wider friend group. The only people she seems to see are her family, boyfriend  and 1 friend who lives a few doors down. 

She hasn‚Äôt shared any of her own struggles in the chat for a long time and it‚Äôs getting more and more difficult to understand how she could come across as so careless. We have asked her to do something with her and her child, her alone, any kind of activities that would accommodate. We‚Äôve offered to come over and help around the house or babysit for her. She says things like yes I‚Äôd love to! And then when it actually comes to planning it she‚Äôll go quiet again. I booked flights to come home to go on a girls staycation for her as a celebration after having her baby. As I was on the way to the airport she said ‚Äòugh don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm bothered anymore‚Äô I was astounded. I flew for that specific reason and other girls took time off work for her too.

I‚Äôm fully aware that she and my friends or anyone else in my life are not responsible for making me feel better, I‚Äôm working towards that myself. However it is very upsetting seeing how much she has changed and how little she seems to care about anything that‚Äôs going on in our lives, good or bad. She was not like this in the past. We‚Äôve been wracking our brains trying to understand if we‚Äôve done anything but we‚Äôve honestly not even been with her enough for that to have occurred over the past 2 years. 

My question is - with all that she has going on herself in her life, how much grace am I supposed to give her here? I am usually up front with friends when things like this happen but I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm being selfish / adding yet another issue to her plate / attacking her. Is this common when someone has their first baby or am I being naive about her really just not caring and I need to cut ties? Any advice much appreciated

Did however leave work to a notice from DPD saying my parcel would be delivered between 1030-1130, pretty good all in when ordered on Thursday. And DPD are probably my favourite delivery company. So to bed or open up new present???

Anyways‚Ä¶. Smaller box than I thought but well packed and mostly cardboard. Bear in mind comparing this to my now dead Delonghi EC710 which is approx 20 years old, it‚Äôs definitely more striking. Lots of reflective steel. Build quality if I‚Äôm honest on first impression isn‚Äôt quite as good externally but still very nice. More compact than I expected. Few reviews commented on the rough edges, it certainly is a little more industrial than the Delonghi. Can definitely understand the longevity of the Delonghi if the internals match the externals. 

All the images I‚Äôve seen of the Anna have a red badge. Mine as you can see is a black graphic. I think I prefer the red if I‚Äôm honest, something more authentic? And the hot plate on top feels like it shouldn‚Äôt be stainless steel, might be better matt or a rougher finish, again like the Delonghi. The rubber edging also feels a little bit like a second thought. 

But don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm picking a little here, I do like it. 

Interestingly, some reviews I‚Äôve seen comment on the water tank being hard to remove. Mine has 2 plastic fold up handles which make it very easy. Have they refined the design further since release?

So warms up very quickly although maybe seems to fluctuate in temperature as it runs - though with subsequent pulls with better pressure it seemed to maintain temp better. 

First pull was a total disaster. Too thin, no crema, way too fast. Subsequent much better and getting 9/10 bar pressure and a longer pull - tamped harder and ground finer. Using Sage Smart Grinder Pro, any suggestions? On grind 7 at the moment.

Even though I have it on the 2:1 setting I nearly always get 45-50ml of espresso with any bean which pours between 25-35s (pump on to off).

I was looking at 2nd hand Barista Express or Bambino & getting a separate grinder but the Bambino seems to be just as expensive 2nd hand as the Barista, well locally to me anyway (¬£200-250). 

Anything I can try with the luxe or would I get better results with another machine? If so, what would be my best bet? 

The other consideration is my wife likes the Ninja because it‚Äôs easy, & it‚Äôs part of the reason I got it because she likes a cold coffee but never actually uses those features.

1nrvizl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nrvizl/i_ended_my_15_yr_of_relationship_with_my_toxic/,I ended my 1.5 yr of relationship with my toxic boyfriend whom I thought I would marry,"I (23F) and my now ex-boyfriend (24M) met while working together. We were in the same company but different locations( his location being my hometown ). It all started with a random drinking date, I being newly out of relationship wanted to have some fun. My now ex invited for some drinks and without a single thought I went for it. As the night proceeded we got close and ended up making out but that was it. In the morning I had visible regret and started ignoring him and clearly told him I wasn‚Äôt interested in him like that but still decided to keep in touch.

Prior to dating we were friends for a year with him pulling a ton of stops to show me that he genuinely cared for me and wanted something more than this friendship. It was like a ritual whenever I visited my hometown I would meet him we would spend a great time together and every time I got this feeling that he wanted something more. I was very mesmerised by his efforts and slowly we started dating casually, he would visit me for the weekend and we would share a wonderful and some spicy time together. 

Finally last September after a ton of thinking I decided to stop going on random dates with guys and give this relationship a shot, and that is where everything went wrong. Honestly I was very scared of relationships due to my past experiences with all of my exs turning out to be very insecure men, the jealousy and hatred was a lot for me to handle. I thought this relationship would be different but I was so wrong. 

Prior to coming in this relationship I sat my now ex boyfriend down and told him about my every relationship and how all these relationships ended because my exs couldn‚Äôt handle me going out with my girlies and talking to guy friends. I specifically told him that I cannot handle this behaviour, and if this was too much for him he can back away from the relationship but he didn‚Äôt he reassured me that this was in the past and we as a couple can restart together. 

First few months were very smooth with the love fever, but then he started having problem with all my daily activities. I consider myself to be an extrovert person love to socialise with people and make new friends, but he had a different take on this. He assumed that I was doing this just for attention from male guys, so as to get an opportunity to go out with them. I found this too absurd, I kept on explaining him that these are just my friends we do share quite some time together that is because we all are away from home and find comfort in each other ( For record we are a close knitted group of around 8-9 people we all work in the same company and live close by hence we meet every evening for some coffee or dinner ). Apart from this I also had some work friends with whom I occasionally went for drinks, there was this one particular guy we were pretty solid friend because we were together on multiple projects and shared a good sense of humour. My now ex accused me on multiple occasions for having feelings for me or that I enjoyed whenever that guy flirted me ( Note he has never meet that friend so he assumed since he was guy he must be flirting with me and couldn‚Äôt just be friends ). 

This pattern continued for months where he would randomly get angry that I am going to meet my friends, and would say let‚Äôs break-up like almost every other week. I would cry my eyes out to sleep and every time this happened he would behave as if nothing happened the next morning. He would often blame himself that I am very bad guy but nothing would change in him. He would often initiate discussion regarding my past and berate me about it, like how he is not comfortable to date someone who had dated so many people( mind you he has a way higher body count that me almost twice ). On multiple dinner dates he had made me cry right in the restaurant because he didn‚Äôt wanna be with a person like me. All this slowly started eating away at me. Every time I would break up he would coming running back to me like he made a mistake he wanted another chance. I was very confused as to what he wanted he would invest heavily in this relationship but at the same time I didn‚Äôt feel he respected me at all. 

This situation just degraded week by week to the point where I would call my besties just to cry. Finally my breaking point came when one weekend he became very aggressive and leaped to check my phone. For almost 2 hrs he fought with to check my phone as he was confirmed that I was cheating on him, at a point I was just fed up and threw the phone at him, he checked and found nothing and immediately started begging to give him one more chance. Another thing I wanted to mention my job is very time consuming I almost work for 10-11 hrs daily, and when I come back home I have to cook and after that prep my self for studies so I literally don‚Äôt have time for his BS. 

I agreed to give him one more chance but wasn‚Äôt seeing any improvement. Everything had to be according to him or it was wrong.

Yesterday I was out with my friends for some exploring and dinner. I texted him the whole time and even talked to him multiple times during the entire duration, but I knew he was mad, I could make that out from his voice. He was mad I was out with my friends, he didn‚Äôt trust me when I told him where I was. Everything exploded the next morning with him calling me a liar, told me to sleep with whoever I want and said that I was a very boring person. So I finally blocked him from all the social media platforms, and from our little game that we used to play everyday together. Now I am out for blood.

1nrvfva,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nrvfva/assess_the_best_coffee_maker_for_offices_keurig/,Assess the Best Coffee Maker for Offices Keurig K1500 Review Worthy?,"If you‚Äôve ever worked in an office or shared a kitchen with a handful of coffee lovers, you might understand the beauty of having a coffee maker that just *gets it done.* That‚Äôs what I thought when I decided to try the **Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker.** With its sleek black design and a promise of convenience, I was curious to see if it could handle my coffee cravings‚Äîand those of my coworkers.

**Sleek Design and Build**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee maker was how compact and stylish it is. Designed for small office spaces or kitchens, it doesn't feel bulky or out of place. It's about the size of a small toaster oven, which makes it easy to fit on countertops with limited space. The black exterior has a modern vibe that blends well with most d√©cor, though I wouldn‚Äôt mind if fingerprints didn‚Äôt show so easily. The build feels solid and reliable‚Äîyou won‚Äôt get a flimsy appliance vibe just looking at it.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
This machine isn‚Äôt just for casual coffee drinkers‚Äîit caters to the picky ones too. You can brew in four different cup sizes: 6 oz., 8 oz., 10 oz., or 12 oz. That STRONG button? A lifesaver for mornings when regular coffee just wouldn‚Äôt cut it. I tested out the settings myself by trying different pod varieties, and to my delight, the strength adjustment really works. The flavor was bold and smooth, with none of that watered-down taste you sometimes get with larger cup sizes. The Quiet Brew Technology also deserves props. Even while brewing multiple cups back-to-back, the machine stays relatively quiet‚Äîa blessing during early meetings or when someone‚Äôs on a call nearby.

**Highlight**  
[Discover if Keurig K1500 is on sale at Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b08491k416/)  

**Convenience for Busy Days**  
One of my favorite features is the massive 96 oz. water reservoir. I‚Äôm not the only coffee drinker in my office, so being able to brew up to 8-10 cups before a refill is a game changer. No more awkward hovering around the coffee maker waiting for someone to refill it. Plus, the reservoir is removable, making it super easy to clean and fill up again. The automatic shut-off feature also earns points because, let‚Äôs face it, nobody loves the moment when they realize they‚Äôve left an appliance running all day. 

**Key Benefits**  
- Brews in four sizes for different caffeine needs  
- STRONG button adds boldness to every cup  
- Quiet operation perfect for office settings  
- Extra-large reservoir reduces refilling frequency  

**Critiques**  
While I‚Äôve been thoroughly impressed with the performance, there are some hurdles to note:  
- The fingerprint-attracting surface requires frequent wiping.  
- Using disposable K-Cups might not sit well with those aiming for an eco-friendly kitchen.  
- Limited customization in temperature settings compared to some higher-end models.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Keurig K1500 to other single-serve coffee makers like the Nespresso Pixie or even Keurig‚Äôs own K-Elite, several distinctions stand out. In terms of water reservoir size, the K1500 wins hands-down; both other models require more frequent refills. However, those looking for barista-quality espresso shots may prefer the Nespresso Pixie, which excels in preparing rich, creamy espresso. The K-Elite, on the other hand, offers additional customization features, like iced coffee settings and temperature adjustment, which are missing here. That said, the K1500 nails convenience and simplicity for medium to heavy usage, making it better suited for group settings or multi-cup needs. 

**Cost Efficiency**  
In terms of financial value, the K1500 offers a fine balance between price and features. It's a solid choice for users sharing the load, like offices or households filled with coffee drinkers who utilize multiple brews per day. It doesn‚Äôt have bells and whistles like other premium picks, but it‚Äôs practical and does its job effectively. If you're all about simplicity and minimal maintenance, this machine justifies its cost well.

I dont know.,"Its 7am and ive been up all night, and im thinking of making coffee and trying to stay awake instead of going to sleep for 12-18 hours. Only good part of that is thinking of you when I fall asleep, sometimes its like youre really here. Its getting really disorienting though and I miss mornings and its been awful for my mental health. I hate being asleep during the day, I start losing hope for everything and like nothings worth it. Im listening to music though which is keeping the dark thoughts at bay for now. I heard a song from a trans artist and I know youd like it. Even if you dont I want to tell you about it but I just know Ill sound like an over the top melodramatic manic pixie. Ive realized recently how often ive done that and how cringe it probably was each time. 

Like when I told you about how I read about the cut sleeve. You hit me with a ‚Äúthats cute‚Äùmeanwhile I was thinking the universe finally aligned and I had found the sacred texts of our people. Smh. I was just being really gay and not subtle in the slightest.  If this is the post that outs me ill probably laugh my ass off. Legit just text me later and say ‚Äúi saw it‚Äù I will cackle. Im a bit all over the place, more so than usual but I cant stop thinking about you. I dont know why I am so attached to you. Im not sure if the why is even important though. What is important is what is. And that its there. And sometimes I think thats what keeps me trapped in our cycle of limited communication. The constant silent asking of ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù 

I think weve both been so conditioned to just silently ask ourselves why things are the way they are instead of stepping up and doing something about it. Instead of asking you if i can call you, or asking you why dont we call eachother, or straight up just fucking call you, i just silently ask myself why dont we call each other? Why dont I know my best friend? Why are we like this? But thats the problem. So I think today im going to ask you. 

Maybe ill tell you. Maybe youll tell me. Maybe well just text each other that were alright. What are we doing? What am I doing? Are we just a couple of fucked up lost boys starving for connection? Is that line as cringey as i think it probably is now that ive actually typed it out? 

If we ever had the chance, would you hold my hand? 

Would you listen to music with me in the kitchen while we wash dishes and fold laundry? Would you stay up with me while we have movie marathons and try out new recipes, laugh with me when I pull the dish out of the oven and it looks nothing like the picture online, but i swear i did everything right. Go grab coffee with me on cold weekend mornings? Dance with me? Find little places in time to build memories in? Id really like that. Id like living life with you.

1nrvent,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1nrvent/delve_into_whether_the_best_electric_kettle_by/,Delve Into Whether the Best Electric Kettle by MegaChef Is Worth It,"Using the MegaChef 1.8 Quarts Electric Kettle became part of my daily routine faster than I expected. This electric kettle, with its sleek matte black surface paired with rose gold accents, immediately caught my eye. The design looks like it was plucked from a retro-style caf√© and dropped directly onto my kitchen counter. Between the aesthetics and its features, I had high hopes‚Äîthough, of course, I‚Äôve found some quirks to keep in mind.

**Aesthetics Designed to Impress**  
The first thing that stands out about this kettle is its visual appeal. Its matte black finish with rose gold highlights screams sophistication while perfectly blending retro charm and modern style. Once it sat on my counter, even friends and family commented on how Instagram-worthy it looked. At 9.25 inches long and 11 inches tall, it‚Äôs compact enough for smaller spaces without looking out of place. The shiny surface does tend to pick up fingerprints, which is worth noting if spotless kitchens are your thing, but that‚Äôs a minor issue compared to its overall eye-catching appearance.  

**Crafting Boiling Water with Precision**  
Boiling water becomes a tactile experience with this kettle. The built-in temperature gauge feels like more than a gimmick‚Äîit‚Äôs incredibly useful when you want water heated to specific temperatures. For instance, I like green tea, and I‚Äôve finally stopped scalding it because I can now keep an eye on the dial. Additionally, the water indicator window is conveniently placed, so there‚Äôs no guessing about how much water is inside. It heats up pretty quickly too; the 1500 watts are no joke. Within minutes, I had piping-hot water ready for tea, coffee, or even instant noodles.  

[Check MegaChef 1.8 Quarts price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0bg9b62sm/)  

**Convenience Features That Simplify Life**  
Many mornings, I‚Äôve appreciated the cordless serving feature because I don‚Äôt have to drag a cord across the kitchen island to pour. The cord storage is another bonus, keeping the setup tidy and uncluttered when the kettle‚Äôs not in use. Drip-free pouring means no annoying splashes across the counter‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve dealt with using other kettles over the years. Another useful feature is the boil-dry protection. One rushed morning, I absentmindedly forgot to add water before turning it on. The kettle stopped itself from overheating, which probably saved it from complete ruin.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Striking retro design with matte black and rose gold combination  
- Rapid boiling thanks to the 1500W power  
- Cordless serving and convenient cord storage for clutter-free counters  
- Precise temperature gauge for brewing-specific needs  

**Caveats to Consider**  
As much as I‚Äôve come to enjoy using this product, it‚Äôs not without its downsides.  
- The premium look does come with upkeep: fingerprints and smudges are pretty visible on the surface.  
- Compared to some competitors, it lacks preset temperature settings, which might frustrate perfectionists seeking more automatic brewing controls.  
- It‚Äôs on the heavier side at over three pounds. This isn‚Äôt a kettle you want to lug back and forth too often‚Äîor at least I don‚Äôt.  

**Competing Brands**  
Having used similar products before, I immediately thought of competitors like Cuisinart and KitchenAid. The Cuisinart model I tried previously did have presets for different brewing temperatures, something the MegaChef kettle lacks, which made brewing even easier. However, the MegaChef wins out when it comes to design. KitchenAid offers some sturdy and solid options but tends to lean bulkier. In a direct match-up between aesthetics and space efficiency, this kettle shines. Performance-wise, all three operate pretty similarly, but the MegaChef leans a little more on style while slightly sacrificing nuanced functionality.  

**Financial Value for This Kettle**  
Given everything it offers, this kettle feels well-priced within its category. Aesthetic design often demands a hefty premium, but this product competes well even against fancier, higher-end models. Adding functional touches like the temperature gauge and boil-dry protection sweetens the deal. While it may not fit every budget, for the visual and practical value it brings, I think it‚Äôs worth every penny. Unlike overly basic electric kettles, this one doubles as kitchen d√©cor, making it feel like more than just another appliance.

Testing Kleenex 1 was a surprisingly satisfying and slightly enlightening experience. These aren‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill tissues‚Äîthey hold up well in a variety of situations, making them a regular fixture in my home and on-the-go arsenal.

**Design and Portability**  
Unlike large tissue boxes that hog space, these sleek, compact pop-up boxes are a game changer. Each box is the perfect size to sit inconspicuously on a countertop, bedside table, or even tucked neatly in the glove compartment of your car. The pop-up feature is smooth, meaning you don‚Äôt end up yanking out half the tissues when you only need one. Plus, the minimalist design somehow manages to blend seamlessly into any setting, from office desks to bathroom shelves. I personally loved the convenience during road trips when space was at a premium.  

[Check Kleenex 1 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0016otd1g/)

**Performance with Everyday Tasks**  
Whether I used these tissues for an allergy-ridden morning or an accidental coffee spill, they handled the situations admirably. Each 2-ply tissue is sturdy enough to resist tearing but soft enough to keep my nose from feeling like it went through sandpaper during cold season. I tested them on a rainy day when my kid got mud on his hands‚Äîthe tissues cleaned up the mess without disintegrating like toilet paper might have. That said, these aren‚Äôt super-absorbent like paper towels, so for larger spills, you'd need multiple tissues. But for small messes, they‚Äôre champions in disguise.  

**Materials and Comfort**  
Being made with 100% cotton is a huge plus, especially for someone like me with sensitive skin. Some brands out there feel a bit cardboard-like, especially after repeated use on the skin, but not these. I could literally blow my nose on these all day (and I might‚Äôve during allergy season) without feeling irritation. My partner even made a point to tell me he prefers these over his usual grocery-store brand, citing their softness while watching sappy movies.  

**Highlights**  
After using these tissues extensively, I‚Äôve noticed several winning points:  
- Compact and stylish design fits anywhere, from a small bathroom shelf to your car‚Äôs cup holder.  
- Exceptionally soft yet durable 2-ply construction.  
- Convenience of the pop-up system truly makes life easier.  

**Hurdles**  
However, no product is perfect, and these tissues do come with their own share of caveats:  
- Not designed for heavy-duty spills‚Äîrequires multiple tissues for larger messes.  
- Slightly more premium than some budget tissue packs, which may not appeal to the super-frugal.

**Competing Products**  
Let‚Äôs talk about competitors for a moment. Brands like Puffs and store labels (like Target's or Walmart's generic options) pose significant competition. Puffs, for example, offers slightly thicker 2-ply tissues. However, they don‚Äôt feel as soft, and their boxes tend to be larger, making them less portable. On the flip side, store brands are generally more affordable, but the compromise on quality shows‚Äîtearing mid-use is too common. Compared to these rivals, Kleenex 1 stands out for its all-round balance of portability, durability, and comfort.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Quality for price is not always an easy equation when considering household staples. Usually, I bake a little skepticism into the price of smaller packaging, thinking it might be overpriced for the convenience factor. However, after using these tissues for weeks, I genuinely believe they‚Äôre worth every penny spent.

For true coffee enthusiasts and professionals, staying ahead of trends is key. Here are the top 5 specialty coffee trends shaping Dubai‚Äôs coffee landscape in 2025:

    1.	Single-Origin Coffee FocusConsumers increasingly demand transparency and quality, favoring single-origin beans sourced ethically from countries like Ethiopia, Colombia, and Yemen. Specialty cafes in Dubai highlight the unique flavor profiles of each origin, often providing detailed tasting notes.
    
    2.	Sustainable and Ethical PracticesEco-consciousness is rising. Cafes and roasters are adopting organic farming, direct trade relationships, and biodegradable packaging to minimize environmental impact. Sustainability is no longer optional but a core value appreciated by consumers.
    
    3.	Innovative Brewing TechniquesBeyond classic espresso and pour-over, methods like siphon brewing, vacuum coffee makers, and nitro cold brews are gaining popularity. Many caf√©s offer experimental brews, blending science and art for unique experiences.
    
    4.	Locally Inspired Flavors and AdditivesDubai‚Äôs multiculturalism inspires specialty blends with local twists ‚Äî cardamom, saffron, rose water, and even dates are integrated into espresso drinks, lattes, and cold brews, bridging tradition and modernity.
    
    5.	Coffee as a Social ExperienceCaf√©s are transforming into community hubs with workshops, coffee tastings, and cupping sessions. More baristas are sharing knowledge openly, creating a culture of coffee education and appreciation accessible to both novices and experts.

No pleasantries, no wasted motion‚Äîjust pure, efficient authority in an expensive suit. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin.‚Äù Two words. That‚Äôs all he ever needs to command absolute silence.

A photo I definitely never took, definitely never shared, and definitely never intended for the wall-sized screen of Marlowe Enterprises‚Äô main conference room. The silence that follows isn‚Äôt just quiet‚Äîit‚Äôs the kind of vacuum that happens right before explosions.

Adrian glances up, that perpetually neutral expression giving nothing away. ‚ÄúMr. Marlowe. A word.‚Äù He follows me out, closing the door behind him with deliberate precision. ‚ÄúIs this about the photo?‚Äù He sounds bored rather than curious, like discussing revenge porn is just another Tuesday agenda item.

1nrv56s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1nrv56s/why_should_you_try_the_best_toaster_oven_our/,Why Should You Try the Best Toaster Oven Our Place Wonder Oven,"The Our Place Wonder Oven has been sitting on my countertop for a month now, and I feel like it's become a kitchen companion. This 6-in-1 air fryer and toaster oven combines versatility with innovation, boasting steam infusion technology that intrigued me the moment I read about it. From air frying crispy french fries to steaming chicken that‚Äôs juicy to the bone, it promised to change the kitchen game, and I couldn‚Äôt pass up the chance to try it.

**Design That Fits Any Countertop Aesthetic**

I‚Äôve owned my share of kitchen appliances, and their bulky designs often make me regret buying them. The Wonder Oven addresses this issue with its compact and space-efficient dimensions: 10.6"" x 11.5"" x 11.6"". It fits snuggly between my blender and coffee maker on the counter. Its stainless steel door balances durability with a sleek modern look, while the charcoal finish feels chic. The controls are simple‚Äîjust a few knobs for temperature, time, and function settings. 

**Good Aspects**

- The compact size doesn‚Äôt compromise cooking capacity, as I was surprised to roast a 4.5-pound chicken in one go.  
- Its rapid preheat makes life convenient when I‚Äôm in a hurry, heating up 75% faster than my standard oven.  
- The multifunctionality means I don‚Äôt need separate devices for baking, roasting, and reheating.  

[Check Our Place Wonder Oven price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0cltkgwqx/)

**Performance That Speeds Up Mealtime**

This oven doesn‚Äôt just look good; it delivers. I tested the air fryer mode on salmon, and the 360-degree air circulation created a crispy outer layer without over-drying the fish. Meanwhile, the bake function handles my go-to banana bread without leaving any uneven spots. What really bowled me over was the steam infusion tech. I cooked bagels to try it out, and the inner texture stayed soft and chewy‚Äîlike something from a bakery.

**Steam Infusion: Innovation in Every Meal**

The steam feature felt like a luxury at first, but now it‚Äôs impossible to go back. I made some roast chicken thighs, and unlike my regular oven, this locked in moisture and kept the flavors alive. I imagine this will be a godsend during the holiday season when I‚Äôm hosting dinners. While I appreciate the steam infusion for enhancing the aroma and texture of each meal, it‚Äôs better suited for people who appreciate gourmet-level cooking experiences.

**Challenges in Use**

- The steep learning curve! It took me a couple of tries to perfect the steam-infused settings.  
- Cleaning steam residue can occasionally feel like a chore, especially around the stainless steel finish.  

**Rival Brands**

In testing out the Wonder Oven, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to the Ninja Foodi Digital Air Fry Oven and the Breville Smart Oven. Ninja‚Äôs model offers some of the same air frying functions, but its bulky design mars its appeal. On the other hand, Breville‚Äôs oven excels at even cooking but lacks steam infusion‚Äîand that‚Äôs a groundbreaking feature for anyone who values advanced functionality. While the Wonder Oven doesn‚Äôt necessarily win in every category, it beats competitors with its cutting-edge steam technology and compact size.

**Worth the Investment?**

Spending money on a kitchen gadget always leaves me questioning if it‚Äôs worth it, especially when multifunctional appliances tend to disappoint. However, the balance of affordability, versatility, and innovative features found in this oven makes it stand out. It doesn‚Äôt try to be the flashiest device out there and does each promised function well.

My task for the day was simple: run a cleanup script to delete a bunch of old, expired coupons from our database. Easy enough, right? My senior dev reviewed my script, it looked solid, and I got the green light to run it on the staging server.

So, I pull up two terminal windows, side-by-side. One connected to the safe, cuddly staging database, the other to the big, scary, DO-NOT-TOUCH production database. I load the script into the staging terminal, take a sip of coffee, and hit Enter. But something felt wrong. The script, which should have taken a few minutes to sift through data, finished in less than a second. My blood ran cold when I saw the output: '10,432 rows affected.' That was‚Ä¶ way too many rows.

My heart hammered against my ribs as I looked at the window's title bar. It wasn't staging. It was production. I had just vaporized every single active coupon our customers were using. The support channel on Slack immediately exploded with messages like 'COUPON SERVICE IS DOWN!' My stomach felt like it had been scooped out with a spoon. I stumbled over to my team lead's desk and managed to croak out, 'I think I just made a very, very big mistake.'

What followed was the most stressful 30 minutes of my life. My senior dev, a true hero, didn't even yell. He just calmly said, 'Okay, let's fix it.' We scrambled to restore the table from the most recent backup while the whole company seemed to be watching. My boss walked over, and I was preparing to be fired on the spot. Instead, he just looked at the situation and said, 'Well, this is a good lesson. Our process failed if a simple mistake like this is possible. Let's talk about adding more safeguards after this is fixed.' I've never felt such a wave of relief.

We got it all restored, and the crisis was over, but I'll never forget that feeling of pure, primal fear. It taught me to respect the power of a single command line and to triple-check which server I'm logged into.

Arabic coffee, or Qahwa, is much more than a beverage in Dubai‚Äîit is a profound cultural tradition and symbol of hospitality. Rooted deeply in Emirati customs, this coffee is known for its light roast, aromatic spices like cardamom, saffron, and sometimes cloves or rose water, which create a distinctively fragrant and delicate taste.

The traditional preparation begins with roasting the coffee beans slowly over an open flame, then grinding them finely, and brewing in a special pot called a dallah. The coffee is served in small cups without handles called finjan, typically accompanied by three dates. These dates balance the slightly bitter, spiced flavor of the coffee, offering a perfect harmony of tastes.

Arabian coffee drinking is a social ritual; it represents generosity and respect. Guests are served starting from the eldest or most honored person, each receiving no more than three small cups. This practice is part of Sabba Al-Qahwa, symbolizing hospitality and bonding.

In Dubai, enjoying Arabic coffee in local caf√©s or at home connects people not only by sharing a drink but also by nurturing a rich cultural heritage that UNESCO recognized as intangible human heritage.

Movies-TV? I am a big fan of Horror and Sci-Fi especially psychological thrillers and time travel stories. If you‚Äôre down to binge-watch something together, even better.

The hallway outside hums loudly, fluorescent bulbs flickering with arrhythmias of their own. *The Night Shift*, they say, has already begun.

¬†

Outside, a tall figure with the head of a hippopotamus, standing on its two hind legs, and a body of a human dressed eloquently, takes a puff of his massive cigar. A badge pinned to his long mid-1900s trench coat reads ‚ÄúHippo-Camus, MD, PhD, PhD, Fellow of the French Academy of Optimism.‚Äù

‚ÄúDr. Dr. Dr. Hippo-Camus?‚Äù I ask tepidly.

He exhales a plume of smoke that curls into the shape of *The Thinker.*

‚ÄúTitles are a distraction, my young trainee. Call me Hippo-Camus. It is a name simple enough to remember, even for a weary hippocampus.‚Äù

I shift nervously. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ how are we doing tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne does as one must. Thus, does one endure and call it survival. The residents name it night float. I call it the labor of Sisyphus, though your stone is the infernal machine they call Epic,‚Äù he said as his cigar ember floated down the dimly lit hallway like a guiding light as he walked. Then, he vanished.

¬†

In the elevator, there‚Äôs a tarnished gold plaque that says ‚ÄúMaria,‚Äù and the buttons ranged from a fiery red ‚Äú-1000 (INSURANCE DEPT.),‚Äù the plastic at the edges melted from the eternal heat, to a starry colored ‚Äúinfinity and beyond‚Äù written with what appears to be a crayon over a piece of duct tape.

I press ‚Äú4000.‚Äù

Maria heaves.

She lurches upward and around floor 3000, Maria begins to drag.

‚ÄúCome on, you got this,‚Äù I say as I pat one of the walls like a personal trainer. She barely manages to reach floor 4000. The doors creak open. I press a puff of my asthma inhaler into the ventilation grate in the corner and whisper, ‚Äúhopefully that helps,‚Äù as I exit.

¬†

Outside of 4002, a deafening sound of numerous alarms from machines keeping the elderly patient alive blares. The patient disappeared beneath tubing and alarms; their face lost to the machines. An IV pole leaned precariously atop five others like *Jenga*.

‚ÄúGood evening, 4002,‚Äù I say with a confident fa√ßade. The patient doesn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm her granddaughter. And I oversee 4002‚Äôs care,‚Äù says a young woman hidden behind a massive ventilator.

‚ÄúGrandma has a history of pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis diagnosed in 79 C.E. from Mount Vesuvius, survived pneumonia in 2020, and she can beat this too. She‚Äôs a fighter,‚Äù says the granddaughter.

‚ÄúFacebook suggests daily prophylactic CPR. TikTok says you can add an epinephrine drip for the ECMO machine. She raised me, I can‚Äôt let her go.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll check with my attending Dr. Dr. Dr. Hippo-Camus and get back to you on that,‚Äù I stammer as I scribble down her requests. ‚Äú*PLAN: Unsure of order set for TikTok drip. Will ask for 4002‚Äôs directive and discuss with attending*.‚Äù

¬†

I step into 4003‚Äôs room across the hallway.

¬†

The room is still, with a dimly lit lamp struggling to stay awake. A frail patient reads *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* as the curtains stirred in the night breeze. At the bedside, an elderly therapy dog in a tattered tracksuit leaned on a cane. Across his top, ‚ÄúPlease Pet‚Äù had been angrily crossed out and replaced with ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT YOU DARE.‚Äù A badge attached to his collar read ‚ÄúMr. Cuddles.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúGood evening, 4003‚Ä¶?‚Äù I say, checking the wristband instinctively.

‚ÄúAh, you must be here to check in on me. Well, I‚Äôll have you know there‚Äôs nothing to be done. My cab driver, The Uber-man, once told me: *Amor Fati*. He had five stars. You don‚Äôt argue with five stars\*.\*‚Äù

Mr. Cuddles growls as I try to pet his matted fur.

‚ÄúJust get the patient some water,‚Äù he says with a demanding tone.

*‚ÄúPLAN: Obtain water as per therapy dog‚Äôs orders. ICD-10 code for Amor Fati doesn‚Äôt exist. Closest is W59.22XA: injury from flying blue tortoise shell while driving.‚Äù*

¬†

I head over to 404. Supposedly an error code according to Resident #56. I knock and open the door. It leads me back to outside 4002, 4003, and‚Ä¶ Maria. I shrug and enter 404 again, but sideways. I‚Äôm then facing 4003 and see Mr. Cuddle‚Äôs tracksuit now say, ‚ÄúWHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?‚Äù I re-enter backwards and bump into Hippo-Camus exiting 4001.

‚ÄúOh! I‚Äôm sorry, Dr. Dr.‚Äì‚Äù I stammer.

‚ÄúTwo rooms: one tethered by apparatus, the other by silence. Both equally absurd. And 404? It is the pursuit of meaning itself. What you discover is not revelation, but indifference,‚Äù says Hippo-Camus, as he re-adjusts his tie.

¬†

The overhead speaker crackles at maximum sleep-disturbing volume.

‚ÄúAttention trainees: It is 03:00. All are required to report to the Morning Mandatory Wellness Lecture. 110% attendance required,‚Äù says a voice that sounds like the mic is inside their throat.

¬†

Maria slowly brings me up to the conference floor. I heard a faint ‚Äúwhy is it always up?‚Äù

¬†

In the conference room, a virtual meeting presenting a pre-recorded wellness lecture was displayed. In the background of the presenter, a digital clock reads 11:00 AM, and the morning sun shining through the windows. The speaker, an unrecognizable faculty member with the upper half of their face cropped off by the camera, sips coffee.

‚ÄúI had 14 hours of sleep yesterday, walked my 5 cats, had breakfast, and had time for yoga twice this morning. Wellness is all about balance. You too can achieve this, if you just manage your time properly!‚Äù Says the speaker, proudly.

Among the many participants on the screen, Resident #81 has bloodshot eyes and an IV coffee drip attached to their arm. The pathology resident is watching the lecture through the lens of their microscope, and the ortho resident is squatting max set.

‚ÄúThere will be a resiliency module assigned at the end of this lecture. Please navigate to Yelp and write a stellar review of the hospital. Only 5-star reviews will be accepted,‚Äù says the speaker.

I exit the meeting and make my way up the stairs to 9068 and 16347 to give Maria a break.

An email from the hospital appears on my phone. ‚ÄúWe are saddened to learn of the sudden passing of one of our residents. *Thoughts and prayers*. In their honor, we ask that you cover their remaining shifts and patients at the hospital. Failure to do so is considered a professionalism violation,‚Äù says the unknown administrator.

¬†

¬†‚ÄúThey seemed well the other day.‚Äù I look down, defeated. ‚ÄúAnd now they‚Äôre dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear you. But did they ever live?‚Äù Says Hippo-Camus as he ascends the stairs beside me.

¬†As we near the 9000^(th) floor, those additional patients were added to my list.

¬†

‚ÄúOne must imagine our trainees happy,‚Äù he states, while smothering his spent cigar under his leather shoe.

¬†

*Sigh.*

¬†

*‚ÄúPLAN: pick up more shifts, get 5 cats, try breakfast, and consider yoga?‚Äù*

It seems like a mix of a good body traditional but with some of the clarity of a delicate pourover. It did have a slight tea flavor and I am thinking it was from my pour. I noticed its harder to get the nozzle into the bed and ended up breaking from a height I usually do not pour from. Otherwise it did taste good. Any advice or suggestions on how to improve the brew by getting rid of the tea notes? Is it the height, the break or possibly the circle pour? I am guessing one of the first two. Costa Rican coffee.

1nruohh,https://www.reddit.com/r/XiaomiGlobal/comments/1nruohh/how_to_decrypt_lsa_or_lsav_file_stepbystep/,How to decrypt .lsa or .lsav file [Step-by-step],"If you're having trouble accessing your photos and videos in a private album, even after trying to scroll and hold, this guide is for you. I faced the same issue and used my basic Git Bash knowledge to recover my files. Here's my documented process, which might help you if you're still looking for a solution.

**How to Decrypt Files from Xiaomi's Private Album That You Can't Access Even Though You Swipe Down on Album**

0. Install Git Bash, Python 3. [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Copy your encrypted files from your device (usually stored in Internal Storage/MIUI/Gallery/cloud/secretAlbum)
2. Extract the Gallery APK from your phone. Use an app like **App Extractor from App Store or Google Play**. Save the Gallery APK file to your computer. Rename it to Gallery.apk to keep it simple.
3. Install **Temurin JDK** from this website:

[https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)

4. During installation, make sure you check the option to ""Add to PATH"". After installation, open Git Bash or Command Prompt and type:

`java -version`

`keytool -help`

If you see version info and help output, Java is installed correctly.

5. Download or clone the miui-cloud-decryptor project from this site (disclaimer: not mine)

[https://github.com/ObikBobik/miui-cloud-decryptor](https://github.com/ObikBobik/miui-cloud-decryptor)

If you download it as a zip, extract it to a simple folder, for example C:\\Desktop\\miui-decryptor

6. Copy your Gallery.apk file into the same folder where miui-cloud-decrypt.py is. That means Gallery.apk and miui-cloud-decrypt.py should be in C:\\Desktop\\miui-decryptor together.

7. Open Git Bash. Change directory to that folder by typing ""cd "" (note the space) then drag your folder to the Git Bash terminal. So that you'll see something like this for example:

`cd /c/deskop/miui-decryptor`

8. Run this command to generate a certificate file:

`keytool -printcert -rfc -jarfile Gallery.apk > cert.pem`

9. Open cert.pem with Notepad. Check that it starts with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and ends with -----END CERTIFICATE-----.

10. In Git Bash, still inside C:\\Desktop\\miui-decryptor, run the following commands:

`openssl x509 -in cert.pem -outform der -out cert.der`

`xxd -p cert.der | tr -d '\n' | cut -c1-32`

11. The last command will print a string of 32 hex characters, something like `a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6.` Copy that string. **That is your secretKey.**

12. From the cloned repository/extracted folder from step 5, open the file \*\*miui-cloud-decrypt.py/\*\* with Notepad. Look for the line (for me it's line number 7) that starts with **secretKey = ... and replace it with** `secretKey = bytes.fromhex(...)`Replace what is inside the parentheses with the hex string you copied in step 11. **Save the file.**

13. Put all your .lsav files into a folder, for example C:\\Desktop\\lsav\_files

14. Go back to Git Bash. Run this command:

`python` [`miui-cloud-decrypt.py`](http://miui-cloud-decrypt.py) `""C:\Desktop\lsav_files""`

The script will process the files in that folder and output the decrypted versions on the same folder where the encrypted files are stored.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** That‚Äôs even more why not to rush into OMSCS full-time**.**

Why burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Taking it slow with a part-time program gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

Mastery doesn‚Äôt come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life‚Äôs not just a race.** This is especially more so now when the track we are in keeps on changing. 

Go at your pace. Your future self will thank yourself for it. And when all is done, post a new thread and celebrate with us.

1nruncr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1nruncr/explore_best_allterrain_baby_stroller_graco/,Explore Best All-Terrain Baby Stroller Graco Outpace LX Worth It,"The Graco Outpace LX impressed me from the moment I took it out of the box. As a parent juggling a seven-month-old and a busy daily schedule, I‚Äôve had my fair share of experience with strollers, and this one quickly stood out in a crowd. Its sleek look, paired with the practical features, made it feel like Graco really had moms and dads in mind when designing this model, known simply as the Graco Outpace LX.

**Durable and All-Terrain Design**

It became clear right away that this stroller means business when it comes to versatility. The three-wheel design, featuring never-flat rubber tires, cruises over a variety of surfaces seamlessly. Whether I took it up a rugged trail or maneuvered through narrow store aisles, it felt steady and reliable. The lightweight metal frame ensures portability without sacrificing durability, and it‚Äôs not overly bulky when folded. With so many strollers feeling like mini tanks, it was refreshing to find one that felt agile yet sturdy. 

[Check Graco Outpace LX price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0cmw2h2sj/)  

**Smooth Rides Courtesy of ComfiTech Suspension**

The standout feature for my little one was the ComfiTech in-seat suspension. Typically, terrain changes lead to unhappy babies, but not this time. My son remained snug and calm on our neighborhood's pothole-riddled sidewalks. I barely had to adjust my pace. Honestly, the smooth suspension could almost make you forget it‚Äôs even a stroller; it's akin to a mini luxury vehicle for babies.

**Convenient Folding Mechanism**

If there's one feature every caregiver appreciates, it‚Äôs how easy a stroller is to store. The Graco Outpace LX scores major points with its one-hand folding system. I‚Äôve tested strollers in the past that required what felt like an engineering degree and extreme patience to fold properly. Here, it's delightfully simple‚Äîpull, fold, done. Bonus: it folds into a compact size with self-standing ability, making it easy to fit into the trunk of my car or stash in a closet.

**Strong Points**

‚Ä¢ Uncomplicated one-hand folding mechanism  
‚Ä¢ ComfiTech suspension for smooth rides, even on uneven terrain  
‚Ä¢ Slim and lightweight design, perfect for urban and suburban environments  
‚Ä¢ Never-flat rubber tires that handle all-weather and road types brilliantly  

**Child and Parent-Friendly Features**

The Graco Outpace LX didn‚Äôt just win points for being functional; it‚Äôs an all-around crowd-pleaser. My own toddler loves the removable dishwasher-safe snack tray, which comes with a cup holder for his ever-important milk bottle. For me, the parent tray included two cup holders that became a convenient home for my coffee and smartphone during morning walks. 

Additionally, the adjustable height harness straps mean I can safely and comfortably use this stroller as my son grows. It‚Äôs rare to find a product that feels as future-proofed while also meeting the needs of the present.

**Areas for Improvement**

‚Ä¢ Parent tray could use more storage space for personal items  
‚Ä¢ Folding mechanism, while straightforward, might not feel intuitive the first time you try it  
‚Ä¢ Lacks built-in lighting, which would‚Äôve been useful for early evening strolls  

**Competing Products**

Other all-terrain strollers in this price range include the Chicco Activ3 Jogging Stroller and the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2. The Chicco feels heavier with marginally less fluid handling on rough surfaces; however, it does include a handbrake for quicker stopping. Meanwhile, the City Mini GT2 offers a similarly premium ride experience but doesn‚Äôt come with any trays or storage for daily-parenting essentials. Comparing these, the Graco Outpace LX‚Äôs snack tray and cup holder inserts make a big difference in practicality, even if it doesn‚Äôt have some bells and whistles like the handbrake. 

**Quality for Price**

Given its performance, I‚Äôd call this a solid investment. Strollers in this category often rack up a hefty price, but the Graco Outpace LX delivers a ton of value without breaking the bank. It‚Äôs user-friendly, loaded with practical features, and genuinely feels built to last through multiple milestones of your child‚Äôs life. Plus, for parents like myself, knowing you‚Äôre not constantly replacing or upgrading a stroller is its own kind of peace of mind.

I found her attractive at first nothihggggg more 
But few days later damnnnnn I feeeeeeeel really attracted to her , I started crushing , her bsf is my bsf's girlfriend's friend and my friend his girlfriend and the crushes' bf knows I started to like her 

And they motivated to talk 
Which i neverrrrrr doooo it takes me ages to start conversing,  
But next day I started talking like cool to meet you and we talk for a week everyday yay wholesome fun convos 
(Although it was me who always initiated)

A college event occurs where we all gather and work for 3 days , and we all had good convos thn again but only grp convos 

After the event ended we met each other in college 
(Remember we are still talking everyday atleast 30 mins of continous convo , hopefully kot forced)
It was raining heavily and she didn't carry an umbrella fortunately I did 
But my clueless ass was too shy to do anything so my friends and her bsf pushed me and motivated me ( without letting her know hopefully) to drop her to station as I had an umbrella , 

So I said I will drop her as I wanna get coffee from the cafe near the station which I will get after dropping her 

I did we walked in rain under a shared umbrella which wasn't able to keep us both dry üòÖ in got wet from my left she from her right 

Butttttttttt

As i am holding the umbrella's handle she too is wrapping her hand around my hand holding the handle 

The butterfliessssssssss I got üò≠üôåüôåüòù

We talked very very awkwardly she was comfortable in talking but I wasn't , i was talking awkwardly , I WAS TALKING  but awkwardly
I might have messed upp 

After dropping her she sends a once view mssg of her and her friends from the train thanking me and I said welcome ig ohh no I said anaytime for you, she replied with a funny sticker 

And she asked me to send pic of my coffee 
Which I didn't get because I only went to drop her 
And I headed back to college hopping like a bunny cause of the ü¶ãü¶ãü¶ã

And friends cheered me and hyped me 

We talked 2 more days after which the exam week had started 
So 
Exam week 1st day I asked her casually how's prep and everything,  she replies and we talk for a while ,


Today I didn't send a message because I really wanted/still want her to send the mssg as I was always the one to initiate it üòÖ
Not sure if this is the right move 
As she might be busy with preps and all but I really wanna hear from her first initiating a convo .

Oops forgot to mention she has also flirted on multiple occasions to which I wasn't able to flirt back cause of the lack of my wittynesssss 

I'm here today now also studying for exams but can't stop thinking bout thissss 
I just wanted to put this somewhere.

(Psst this is the 1st time I have put soo much efforts for someone)


Do you think she might be into me or whattt ?

Oh and should I keep being the one starting /initiating convos online ?

1nruba2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nruba2/my_father_was_a_cult_leader_he_took_my_eye_so/,My father was a cult leader. He took my eye so that I might see.,"My life was ruined the day I turned twelve years old.

Everyone wants to know what it was like growing up in a cult. They want to hear all the sordid details: did they beat you? Cut you? Was it a sex thing? If you‚Äôre not careful, you turn into an object of fascination, a human curio. All anyone cares about is what horrible thing might have happened in your past. And when you tell them the truth, they have the gall to be disappointed.

The truth is that before my twelfth birthday, my life was ordinary.

I grew up in a position of privilege. While my mother was just a washerwoman, my father was someone of status. He was the leader of our church. While he had many wives and many children, I was the only son. That meant I was treated with respect and deference. I wasn‚Äôt beaten or tortured. Neither were any of my friends or half-sisters. The only difference between my upbringing and others is while most parents probably read their children¬†*Dr. Suess,*¬†my father would read me the Apocrypha to rock me to sleep.

Like I said, a perfectly average life.

I had a friend, B. We were born on the same day, two hours apart. For the next twelve years, we lived right next to each other. We spent every moment of our growing up in each other‚Äôs company. We loved all of the same things: swimming, playing with wooden swords, building imaginary cities out of the crumbling stones of our home.

But above all else, we loved to explore.

We did not live in houses built by our own hand or surrounded by the confines of barbed wire traced fences like most cults. We lived in the ruins, or sanctuary as we referred to them.

When our ancestors came to the valley, lost, starving, and half-insane, they took the crumbling buildings as a sign from God. This was the paradise deity wished for us to inhabit. The ruins were a sprawling complex, crumbling roads and buildings all made of decaying stone cut from an unknown quarry. At the center of it all was a great gothic tower, stretching high over the landscape. It covered our entire settlement in its shadow. On quiet days, when the sky was overcast and muffled, some claimed you could hear it humming, a deep throaty noise that shook your bones and boiled your blood.

I can only imagine how desperate my progenitors must have been to see this place as their salvation.¬†

B and I first discovered the underground passages when we were ten. They formed a twisting labyrinth that extended beneath the whole city proper. We believed we had uncovered a great mystery, known only to ourselves, and began to explore those dark passages, armed with ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù candles and chalk.¬†

Our mothers discovered our first attempts, and forbade us from going back into those depths. But while we pretended to agree to never return, we would sneak away whenever we could to continue our efforts.

We discovered many things, secret passages between houses, abandoned rooms attached to our subterranean playground. Sometimes we even came across hidden places.¬†

When I was eleven years old. B and I had discovered a secret room attached to one of the tunnels. B had tripped on a rock and fallen through a wall when he tried to catch himself. The hole he created led to an open space, a room with a low ceiling. The walls were covered with all manner of carvings, and words that looked to be written in Greek. We were required to learn all the biblical languages as part of our grade school education, so we were familiar.¬†

But these words were different. The composition was all wrong, and the letters were scrambled and jumbled in odd formations.

B and I immediately made this into our own personal hide out. We would examine the pictures and strange words, sounding them out with untrained tongues and imagined pronunciations. We would speculate on their origins, and revel in the knowledge that no one knew of this room except for us.

One Sunday, we snuck off after church service to be in our hideout. In our tradition, the first part of worship was held in the courtyard of the tower every Sunday and was attended by all. The second session was held directly afterwards in the tower. Children were not allowed to attend. B and I often took advantage of this lack of supervision and went to the tunnels.¬†

That Sunday, we made our way to the room and began our usual game of creating theories as to what the words on the wall said. We were focused on a series of symbols that appeared together in several places around the room.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a verb?‚Äù I looked at B. His face was drawn up in an almost comical look of concentration. But he wasn‚Äôt playing it up. B just took thinking very seriously.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not.‚Äù B looked at me, indignant. ‚ÄúLook how many times they wrote it. That could be a sign. Elder Luke told me that‚Äôs a way you can tell.‚Äù

Elder Luke was our school teacher. He knew more about Christian lore than any other person alive. But that was not the most interesting thing about him. He had no arms. This wasn‚Äôt especially odd. It seemed like a lot of adults where we lived had similar problems. Some were missing fingers, toes. Elder Mark was missing his right leg from the knee down. But Elder Luke was missing both of his upper limbs, and was impaired by his lack. Each shoulder ended in a stump two inches extended from his torso.

B was the most intelligent child in our class. Elder Luke often turned to him when he needed to write things down. They also spent extra time together in tutoring sessions. Everyone knew it was to prepare B for his future calling. With his brain, it was only natural B would become a teacher and scriptorian.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù To tell the truth, I had no evidence to suggest otherwise. I was just jealous B seemed to be right about everything. I struggled in school, and sometimes I saw Elder Luke whispering to my Father at church, glancing in my direction. I was sure they were talking about how poorly I was doing.

B ignored me. He got close to the word and traced it with his finger. Dirt came away from it in fine grains, making the etching stand out on the wall. ‚ÄúIt looks familiar. I think I‚Äôve read it somewhere before.‚Äù

I probably would have kept arguing, except my thoughts were interrupted by a noise. It sounded like someone speaking. B and I looked at each other, and blew out our candles. Our mothers‚Äô had caught us in the tunnels a few weeks ago, and we weren‚Äôt eager to repeat that experience.

But as we waited in the dark, the sound developed. It wasn‚Äôt our mothers. It was human, but it wasn‚Äôt the tones of a normal composed voice. It was a pleading and begging wail. It grew louder, and more ragged. The desperate noise echoed on the walls, and I felt the hair on my neck prickle.¬†

The sound continued to expand. It became an open-mouthed keening, the kind you hear when one‚Äôs misery is so great the words don‚Äôt have time to form in your brain before the pain comes out of your throat. I had heard Sister Mary make that noise when her son had died of fever. It had gone on for what felt like years. At the time, I worried she would die too if she didn‚Äôt stop.

I found B in the dark and pulled myself closer to him. I felt B shift beside me, searching for something. There was a flare, and B relit his candle with a small piece of cloth he had set alight with his flint. He patted out the cloth until it stopped smoking and put it in his pocket. He reached over with his candle and lit mine.

I got up to look out the hole. I was worried that I would see whatever was making that sound the moment I poked my head out. But once my eyes cleared the wall, I saw nothing down either path.

B had a determined look on his face. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds close.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy. That noise‚Ä¶feels wrong.‚Äù

B got up to peek out with me. ‚ÄúIt sounded like crying. Someone might be hurt.‚Äù

This pricked my conscience. We were taught to help each other in church. Imagining someone down there, broken and afraid, was just enough of an emotional hit to make me rethink my fear. ‚Äú...Fine. I hate you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but your mother doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I swung to hit B on the arm, but he ducked out of the way. He grinned at me. The playfulness cut the tension a bit and I could almost tell myself everything would be fine. But the noise sounding in my ears a moment later brought back all the old fears.

B left the room first. He stepped out into the dark, and made his way down the right hand tunnel. I followed. My feet dragged on the ground as I tried to keep up with him. We held our candles aloft, tiny pin pricks of light in the overpowering gloom.

With each turn in the tunnel, we went deeper. Soon, we exhausted all our familiar routes. When we turned onto an unknown path and heard the noise increase in volume, we knew we were close. The keening grew louder with each step. It began to reverberate in my chest. I wanted to cover my ears, to block it out. At every junction, I worried we were about to run headlong into the source of this terrible sound, only to feel relief when we saw nothing. But then we‚Äôd continue on, and the noise would grow clearer and more terrible than before.

Then just as we made another turn, the noise stopped.

Everything was silent. It was a long time until we began to hear the noise of the cave again, the dripping of water and the echo of flowing air.

B took another step forward, but I grabbed his shoulder. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. We‚Äôre gonna get lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounded like it was right around the corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs¬†*gone.*¬†If we don‚Äôt get back soon they‚Äôre gonna notice we‚Äôre not there.‚Äù

B shrugged off my hand and ran forward. I followed behind, not wanting to be left alone. We didn‚Äôt have to go far, we ran into a dead end almost immediately. It was a brick wall, similar to the kind that had blocked up our secret room. The stone was different from that of the tunnel. It was old, weathered, and was missing two bricks that had come loose and fallen to the ground. Where the two bricks had been was a dark hole.

B peered into it. I couldn‚Äôt see anything with the light of my candle. It was almost like the dark inside was swallowing the feeble yellow rays. My eyes played tricks on me. In the pitch black, it looked like shadows were moving around in the space beyond.

‚ÄúCan we go? Please?‚Äù

B kept peering into the hole. ‚ÄúI think I see something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come back later, okay? We‚Äôre gonna get caught.‚Äù I looked over my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt want to say it out loud, but it felt like someone was down here with us, watching. I saw no movement, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling like eyes were searching all over my body.

B turned to look at me, and saw how scared I was. He nodded slow, and pushed me forward. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

It took a long time to get to the surface. We had to double back a few times to make up for some incorrect turns. But eventually, we were in the sunlight again, and we joined up with the other children just as the adults returned from their meeting in the tower. I saw my father lead them out. Our mothers opened their arms to receive us. B and I embraced them. But even in the warmth of relief and safety, I couldn‚Äôt shake the cold feeling that still clung to my chest and mind.

While B and I still went to the room with the words, we never spoke of that noise again. Mostly, this was my fault. I had a hard time sleeping after the incident, and every time B tried to bring up the subject, I would shut him down.

A year passed, and I prepared for the acceptance of my calling and entrance into manhood. I had known since I was young that I was to become the next patriarch when it was time for my father to step down. That meant more school, and more time spent in his shadow. Before long, I didn‚Äôt have much time to spend with B anymore, and we stopped exploring the caverns.

Father would take me on long walks, explaining the importance of his role as leader. He often said strange things that made little sense to me. One night, as we were tending to my mother‚Äôs garden, he began to talk of the future, and how I would lead our church.¬†

‚ÄúYou must see things others can‚Äôt see.‚Äù He went to grab a weed, his hand missing the stem. He readjusted, grasped it with a firm hand and pulled it out the root still intact. My Father only possessed one eye. It was light blue, and sometimes I felt it could peer into my very soul. The empty socket was covered up in a bandage that swept over the side of his face.

I was old enough to think it was ironic that a man with one eye was telling me to see things, but I didn‚Äôt voice it. My father was a strict man. I had never seen his rage, but there was a coldness in his demeanor that made me fall silent in his presence. It took all my energy to find my voice to ask the proper question. ‚Äú...how do I do that? I‚Ä¶‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish the sentence. But Father knew what I meant. I was too stupid. Too slow. I barely saw what was under my own nose.

‚ÄúBe patient, son.‚Äù Father scooted closer to me, and put a hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and a little wet from the soil, but it was also comforting. ‚ÄúYou will understand. You are my blood. This is how it has been and will be.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt so sure, but I nodded and went back to work. I was still years away from any sort of responsibility, and there were more exciting things to look forward to now.

I was approaching my birthday. My twelfth birthday.

On that day, I would enter the tower.

It was a rite of passage for us. Most entered at the age of fifteen. Father had arranged it so I might enter early. He felt I was ready. I had looked forward to this day for as long as I could remember. Whenever anyone left the tower after worship, they always had the most blissful look of joy upon their faces.

I wanted that. I wanted to feel that joy, to see what was inside, to peer down from the top of its embankments and to see the entire valley like a bird might.

The night before my birthday, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I tossed and turned in my bed, imagining all the things that could possibly be inside of that strange and mysterious building.

It was near the middle of the night when I heard my mother crying.

I crept out of my cot and went to check on her. I had been spending time away to receive instruction from my father, and this next step was one that would alter our relationship. I would be a man when I emerged. I knew she wasn‚Äôt ready to let go of her little boy. I approached her living space and peeked in.

She was kneeling by her cot, her hands clasped in pleading supplication. I could not hear what she said, but I knew it to be whispered begging. ‚ÄúPlease, God, do not take my boy,‚Äù was the only phrase I heard in its completeness.

I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't make myself enter the room. I had the strange feeling I was seeing something I was not supposed to see. After a moment or two of indecision, I crept on light feet back to my own cot. I lay down, but I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. A new nervousness ate at my belly and made me stare at the dark ceiling until the light of torches roused from my bed.

The time had come.

Outside, my father and two attendants waited for my arrival. I roused and got dressed in the ceremonial robes of white. My mother presented them to me. Her eyes were dry, with seemingly no trace of the crying she had done the night before. Only a slight twinge of red betrayed her secret tears. I slipped the robes over my head, and gave her a hug, hoping to show her that everything was fine, that we would still be mother and son even after the events of this day.

She held me tight for a moment, her hands clasped around me. Then, when I began to wonder if she would ever let me go, I felt her hands release.

I kissed her on the cheek, then followed my father out of our house and to the tower.

Some had come to watch our procession. I saw B, staring at me with a serious look on his face. I smiled at him and waved, but all he gave me in return was a distracted nod. He looked up at the tower, then back at me. Eventually, our procession moved beyond his place and he was lost in the crowd.

The tower loomed larger with every step, and eventually we came to its entrance. My father stopped me. He turned me toward him and looked me in the eyes.

‚ÄúSon, a leader takes his role willingly.‚Äù His one eye caught mine and I had to fight the urge to look down. ‚ÄúWill you do what I say when the time comes?‚Äù

I swallowed down the nervous bile that was rising in the back of my throat. I nodded.

Father turned, and opened the door to the tower.

We stepped inside. It was dark, no light from the outside penetrated the stone walls. The torches the two attendants carried lit up the space. I looked up, surprised to see that the inside of the building was almost entirely hollow except for wooden supports. I could see all the way up to the roof, a small dark circle high above us.

There was a door at the far side. Father approached it and swung it open. Beyond it was a staircase leading downward. He bade me to follow, and then descended down into the darkness.

I waited a moment, anxious. Then I followed.

I don‚Äôt know how far down we went. I lost track of time trying to keep my footing on the cold stone stairs. I tried to keep pace with my father, his form obscured at the edge of the torchlight. The air grew cold, like it did in the tunnels under the city. I saw my breath coalesce in front of my face. I shivered, but I tried to hide it by stepping more firmly and clenching my muscles.

Without warning, the staircase leveled out into a smooth stone floor, cut directly into the rock. It stretched out to a small door at the end of a hallway. I swallowed and felt my ears pop. How deep had we gone?

Father made his way down the hall and opened the door, revealing a dark space on the other side. I approached until I was at his side. He gestured for me to go through before him.

I took a deep breath, and went into the blackness.

On the other side of the door was a large chamber. Its walls were smooth, unblemished. If it had been carved out of the rock, it had not been done by any human means. The polished surface almost reflected back the torchlight. Strange shapes I could not make out were huddled against the sides, and after a moment‚Äôs inspection, I realized they were large containers made from sanded wood and iron hinges.

‚ÄúSon.‚Äù My eyes went to my father. He had made his way to the center of the room without me noticing. He beckoned me with his hand.

He stood next to a low stone table.

The stone was cut at impossible right angles. The edges looked sharp enough to cut flesh. I came to him, aware of the attendants that followed close behind me. Surrounding the table were stone benches that made concentric circles, like a theater in the round.

‚ÄúLay down.‚Äù Father moved aside to grant me access to the flat surface.

I hesitated. I felt what I had in those tunnels a year ago, like eyes all around the room were watching us. I thought I could hear whispers in the echoes of our footsteps. The darkness had encompassed us so completely I could no longer see the walls. The air was strangely thick and hard to breathe.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, son.‚Äù My father‚Äôs voice brought me back. I looked at him, and he smiled. He had never smiled at me before.

I laid down on the slab.

Father walked to the edge of the room. He spoke aloud to me, his voice bouncing off the walls and ceilings of the dome. It sounded to me as if he had never left my side. ‚ÄúYou have been instructed about the purpose of life. Tell me now, what is that purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo learn of the Almighty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is correct. And can you tell me why?‚Äù¬†

I struggled to remember what Elder Luke had taught us in school. I heard the sound of wood creaking. ‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶prepare ourselves for‚Ä¶for heaven?‚Äù

Father didn‚Äôt respond. I heard the clink of metal. I turned to look at him. His back was to me, and he was hunched over one of the boxes at the room's edge.

Finally, he rose up, and turned back to me. I looked up at the ceiling.

‚ÄúHalf-true. Tell me, son, what is heaven?‚Äù

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶place?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what is taught‚Ä¶‚Äù Father drew closer to me. His footsteps grew louder, and I fought to still my pounding heart. Both attendants stood at my side, torches in the air, their faces looking grim. ‚ÄúBut it is a lie. Heaven is not a place. It is knowledge. How do we gain knowledge?‚Äù

I knew the answer to this. It was part of a phrase Elder Luke recited to me almost every day. He loved to say it when I couldn‚Äôt remember the chapter or verse he was referring to. ‚ÄúBy sacrifice.‚Äù

My father stood above me now. His one eye stared down at me, cold and dark. My heart was beating out of my chest.

‚ÄúI told you that you would need to see what others could not.‚Äù Father moved his hand, and in it I could see a strange metallic instrument. One side was flat and sharp on the edge. The other was scooped like a spoon. He held it to a torch until, and it started to glow hot in the firelight. ‚ÄúPrepare yourself, son. It will only hurt for a moment.‚Äù

I knew then what he meant to do. Any courage that I had broke. I tried to get up, but the attendants pushed down my arms. I began to scream. ‚ÄúNo, no, NO! Please, Father! I don‚Äôt want to! STOP!‚Äù¬†

I wasn‚Äôt a man. I was just a scared little boy. I couldn‚Äôt do this. I couldn‚Äôt do what my Father wanted.

The attendants became uncomfortable. One looked at Father. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not willing.‚Äù

Father's head moved with a jerk to look at him. For the first time in my life, I saw his anger. It burned dark and intensely on his features. I quavered and fell silent.

Father held the gaze of the other attendant for a long moment. ‚ÄúHe agreed. That is what matters.‚Äù

The metal instrument descended, smoking.

I saw the scooped edge come closer and closer to my face. I tried to shut my eyes against it, but I felt the steady pressure of father‚Äôs fingers pulling open the skin. I felt the heat of the metal held close. It was already unbearable. Father was strong, and it took no effort for him to secure my thrashing head with one hand. I cried out and tears ran down my face in twin rivers. I tasted salt as they flowed into my open mouth. I pled with my Father, begged him to stop.

The knife connected with my right eye.

It burned. It pressed deep into my skull, I saw bright flashes that took up the entire right side of my vision. I screamed so loud I felt my throat crack and I tasted the iron of blood. I felt liquid on my cheek that was thicker than my tears. The knife slowly passed around the entirety of the socket, singeing the skin away like tissue.¬† Father pulled, and it felt like a hot iron bar was being shoved through my head. After a moment of intense agony, I felt something give, and there was pressure on my right cheek. When I opened my left eye, I saw the opposite orb resting against my flesh, connected only by a thin string of bleeding flesh.

Father took up the eye, his fingers painfully cold upon it, and he severed the optic nerve.

Everything went dark.

I wanted to die, I wanted it to be over. I wondered if I was already dead. I could still feel the slab beneath me, the blood and tears on my face, the ache of my burns.

The darkness gathered.

What had been pure blackness before coalesced into shapes. Terrible beings defying all logic. They were all around me, staring at me with eyes half-obscured. Some had many limbs, and others bodies covered with mouths. They pressed forward, and I could feel their breath, the touch of their hands. They were so cold. I tried to fight, but the pain of it all was too great, and my arms and legs weakened. I felt my consciousness flee to a place where it might never return.

I heard my father speak before my mind left me.

‚ÄúWell done, my son.‚Äù

‚Äî

When I woke up, I was in an ambulance.

It has taken me years to recover from the lies of my childhood. I was young and not privy to all the complicated happenings of the outside world, nor were they spoken about in my presence. To me, there was no world outside of our community.

When I emerged unconscious from the tower, the settlement was being raided by the FBI.

Hikers had been going missing in the areas adjacent to our city for years. Investigations had uncovered disturbing documentation that indicated the violation of human rights. One look at me and my missing eye told them everything they needed to know. I was taken away and my father was arrested.

Far from being comforting, I was terrified. People joke about bringing those from the past to the modern era, about how they would go insane if they saw the progress of mankind. I very nearly did. For most of a month, I was sedated as they took care of my injuries and de-programed my brain so I could re-enter society.

After this process was done, they had me testify against my father to support the state‚Äôs case. The only charge that stuck was child abuse. He was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, the maximum possible sentence.

I never saw my Mother after that day. I have no idea what happened to her.

It‚Äôs been two decades. I went through the foster care system. I found a pair of good parents willing to work with my sensitive past. I graduated high school, went to college, and even got a degree.

But it‚Äôs all been tainted. I can never escape my past. My missing eye is a constant reminder of who I am, where I came from, and how I‚Äôll never be able to escape into anonymity. I will always be the boy whose cult leader father took his eye.

And there are the visions as well.

Doctors said it was a form of PTSD. But I‚Äôm not so sure. At first, I would only see them out of the corner of my eyes. Dark shadows like the ones that appeared when my eye was taken. They would flit away if I ever tried to look at them properly. Sometimes I can feel the gaze of their¬† many eyes even before I see their presence.

I‚Äôve ignored it for years. But recently they have become bolder.

Just the other day, I saw one standing in a crowd as I waited in line to buy a coffee. It didn‚Äôt run when I looked at it. It just watched me, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, eyes blinking, mouths open, like it was waiting for something.

The Doctors keep prescribing pills, but they don‚Äôt work.

My father did something more to me in that cave than just take my eye. I worry it‚Äôs going to kill me. I‚Äôve been going deep, looking for any possible solution, no matter how crazy, to figure out how to stop this.

I got an email yesterday. It was from B, or someone who claimed to be him. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard from him since the day I first entered the tower. I didn‚Äôt even know he was still alive. The email said he wants to meet me tomorrow. He says there are things we need to talk about.

I get emails like this sometimes, and normally put them right in the trash, but he said something that made me stop before I pressed the button.

‚ÄúI was right about the word on the wall. It‚Äôs a name.

I know about your visions.

Come see me, and I‚Äôll tell you how to stop them.‚Äù

Whoever sent this to me, I‚Äôm meeting them tomorrow.¬†

1nrub13,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_the_scared_scholar/comments/1nrub13/my_father_was_a_cult_leader_he_took_my_eye_so/,My father was a cult leader. He took my eye so that I might see.,"My life was ruined the day I turned twelve years old.

Everyone wants to know what it was like growing up in a cult. They want to hear all the sordid details: did they beat you? Cut you? Was it a sex thing? If you‚Äôre not careful, you turn into an object of fascination, a human curio. All anyone cares about is what horrible thing might have happened in your past. And when you tell them the truth, they have the gall to be disappointed.

The truth is that before my twelfth birthday, my life was ordinary.

I grew up in a position of privilege. While my mother was just a washerwoman, my father was someone of status. He was the leader of our church. While he had many wives and many children, I was the only son. That meant I was treated with respect and deference. I wasn‚Äôt beaten or tortured. Neither were any of my friends or half-sisters. The only difference between my upbringing and others is while most parents probably read their children¬†*Dr. Suess,*¬†my father would read me the Apocrypha to rock me to sleep.

Like I said, a perfectly average life.

I had a friend, B. We were born on the same day, two hours apart. For the next twelve years, we lived right next to each other. We spent every moment of our growing up in each other‚Äôs company. We loved all of the same things: swimming, playing with wooden swords, building imaginary cities out of the crumbling stones of our home.

But above all else, we loved to explore.

We did not live in houses built by our own hand or surrounded by the confines of barbed wire traced fences like most cults. We lived in the ruins, or sanctuary as we referred to them.

When our ancestors came to the valley, lost, starving, and half-insane, they took the crumbling buildings as a sign from God. This was the paradise deity wished for us to inhabit. The ruins were a sprawling complex, crumbling roads and buildings all made of decaying stone cut from an unknown quarry. At the center of it all was a great gothic tower, stretching high over the landscape. It covered our entire settlement in its shadow. On quiet days, when the sky was overcast and muffled, some claimed you could hear it humming, a deep throaty noise that shook your bones and boiled your blood.

I can only imagine how desperate my progenitors must have been to see this place as their salvation.¬†

B and I first discovered the underground passages when we were ten. They formed a twisting labyrinth that extended beneath the whole city proper. We believed we had uncovered a great mystery, known only to ourselves, and began to explore those dark passages, armed with ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù candles and chalk.¬†

Our mothers discovered our first attempts, and forbade us from going back into those depths. But while we pretended to agree to never return, we would sneak away whenever we could to continue our efforts.

We discovered many things, secret passages between houses, abandoned rooms attached to our subterranean playground. Sometimes we even came across hidden places.¬†

When I was eleven years old. B and I had discovered a secret room attached to one of the tunnels. B had tripped on a rock and fallen through a wall when he tried to catch himself. The hole he created led to an open space, a room with a low ceiling. The walls were covered with all manner of carvings, and words that looked to be written in Greek. We were required to learn all the biblical languages as part of our grade school education, so we were familiar.¬†

But these words were different. The composition was all wrong, and the letters were scrambled and jumbled in odd formations.

B and I immediately made this into our own personal hide out. We would examine the pictures and strange words, sounding them out with untrained tongues and imagined pronunciations. We would speculate on their origins, and revel in the knowledge that no one knew of this room except for us.

One Sunday, we snuck off after church service to be in our hideout. In our tradition, the first part of worship was held in the courtyard of the tower every Sunday and was attended by all. The second session was held directly afterwards in the tower. Children were not allowed to attend. B and I often took advantage of this lack of supervision and went to the tunnels.¬†

That Sunday, we made our way to the room and began our usual game of creating theories as to what the words on the wall said. We were focused on a series of symbols that appeared together in several places around the room.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a verb?‚Äù I looked at B. His face was drawn up in an almost comical look of concentration. But he wasn‚Äôt playing it up. B just took thinking very seriously.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not.‚Äù B looked at me, indignant. ‚ÄúLook how many times they wrote it. That could be a sign. Elder Luke told me that‚Äôs a way you can tell.‚Äù

Elder Luke was our school teacher. He knew more about Christian lore than any other person alive. But that was not the most interesting thing about him. He had no arms. This wasn‚Äôt especially odd. It seemed like a lot of adults where we lived had similar problems. Some were missing fingers, toes. Elder Mark was missing his right leg from the knee down. But Elder Luke was missing both of his upper limbs, and was impaired by his lack. Each shoulder ended in a stump two inches extended from his torso.

B was the most intelligent child in our class. Elder Luke often turned to him when he needed to write things down. They also spent extra time together in tutoring sessions. Everyone knew it was to prepare B for his future calling. With his brain, it was only natural B would become a teacher and scriptorian.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù To tell the truth, I had no evidence to suggest otherwise. I was just jealous B seemed to be right about everything. I struggled in school, and sometimes I saw Elder Luke whispering to my Father at church, glancing in my direction. I was sure they were talking about how poorly I was doing.

B ignored me. He got close to the word and traced it with his finger. Dirt came away from it in fine grains, making the etching stand out on the wall. ‚ÄúIt looks familiar. I think I‚Äôve read it somewhere before.‚Äù

I probably would have kept arguing, except my thoughts were interrupted by a noise. It sounded like someone speaking. B and I looked at each other, and blew out our candles. Our mothers‚Äô had caught us in the tunnels a few weeks ago, and we weren‚Äôt eager to repeat that experience.

But as we waited in the dark, the sound developed. It wasn‚Äôt our mothers. It was human, but it wasn‚Äôt the tones of a normal composed voice. It was a pleading and begging wail. It grew louder, and more ragged. The desperate noise echoed on the walls, and I felt the hair on my neck prickle.¬†

The sound continued to expand. It became an open-mouthed keening, the kind you hear when one‚Äôs misery is so great the words don‚Äôt have time to form in your brain before the pain comes out of your throat. I had heard Sister Mary make that noise when her son had died of fever. It had gone on for what felt like years. At the time, I worried she would die too if she didn‚Äôt stop.

I found B in the dark and pulled myself closer to him. I felt B shift beside me, searching for something. There was a flare, and B relit his candle with a small piece of cloth he had set alight with his flint. He patted out the cloth until it stopped smoking and put it in his pocket. He reached over with his candle and lit mine.

I got up to look out the hole. I was worried that I would see whatever was making that sound the moment I poked my head out. But once my eyes cleared the wall, I saw nothing down either path.

B had a determined look on his face. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds close.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy. That noise‚Ä¶feels wrong.‚Äù

B got up to peek out with me. ‚ÄúIt sounded like crying. Someone might be hurt.‚Äù

This pricked my conscience. We were taught to help each other in church. Imagining someone down there, broken and afraid, was just enough of an emotional hit to make me rethink my fear. ‚Äú...Fine. I hate you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but your mother doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I swung to hit B on the arm, but he ducked out of the way. He grinned at me. The playfulness cut the tension a bit and I could almost tell myself everything would be fine. But the noise sounding in my ears a moment later brought back all the old fears.

B left the room first. He stepped out into the dark, and made his way down the right hand tunnel. I followed. My feet dragged on the ground as I tried to keep up with him. We held our candles aloft, tiny pin pricks of light in the overpowering gloom.

With each turn in the tunnel, we went deeper. Soon, we exhausted all our familiar routes. When we turned onto an unknown path and heard the noise increase in volume, we knew we were close. The keening grew louder with each step. It began to reverberate in my chest. I wanted to cover my ears, to block it out. At every junction, I worried we were about to run headlong into the source of this terrible sound, only to feel relief when we saw nothing. But then we‚Äôd continue on, and the noise would grow clearer and more terrible than before.

Then just as we made another turn, the noise stopped.

Everything was silent. It was a long time until we began to hear the noise of the cave again, the dripping of water and the echo of flowing air.

B took another step forward, but I grabbed his shoulder. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. We‚Äôre gonna get lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounded like it was right around the corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs¬†*gone.*¬†If we don‚Äôt get back soon they‚Äôre gonna notice we‚Äôre not there.‚Äù

B shrugged off my hand and ran forward. I followed behind, not wanting to be left alone. We didn‚Äôt have to go far, we ran into a dead end almost immediately. It was a brick wall, similar to the kind that had blocked up our secret room. The stone was different from that of the tunnel. It was old, weathered, and was missing two bricks that had come loose and fallen to the ground. Where the two bricks had been was a dark hole.

B peered into it. I couldn‚Äôt see anything with the light of my candle. It was almost like the dark inside was swallowing the feeble yellow rays. My eyes played tricks on me. In the pitch black, it looked like shadows were moving around in the space beyond.

‚ÄúCan we go? Please?‚Äù

B kept peering into the hole. ‚ÄúI think I see something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come back later, okay? We‚Äôre gonna get caught.‚Äù I looked over my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt want to say it out loud, but it felt like someone was down here with us, watching. I saw no movement, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling like eyes were searching all over my body.

B turned to look at me, and saw how scared I was. He nodded slow, and pushed me forward. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

It took a long time to get to the surface. We had to double back a few times to make up for some incorrect turns. But eventually, we were in the sunlight again, and we joined up with the other children just as the adults returned from their meeting in the tower. I saw my father lead them out. Our mothers opened their arms to receive us. B and I embraced them. But even in the warmth of relief and safety, I couldn‚Äôt shake the cold feeling that still clung to my chest and mind.

While B and I still went to the room with the words, we never spoke of that noise again. Mostly, this was my fault. I had a hard time sleeping after the incident, and every time B tried to bring up the subject, I would shut him down.

A year passed, and I prepared for the acceptance of my calling and entrance into manhood. I had known since I was young that I was to become the next patriarch when it was time for my father to step down. That meant more school, and more time spent in his shadow. Before long, I didn‚Äôt have much time to spend with B anymore, and we stopped exploring the caverns.

Father would take me on long walks, explaining the importance of his role as leader. He often said strange things that made little sense to me. One night, as we were tending to my mother‚Äôs garden, he began to talk of the future, and how I would lead our church.¬†

‚ÄúYou must see things others can‚Äôt see.‚Äù He went to grab a weed, his hand missing the stem. He readjusted, grasped it with a firm hand and pulled it out the root still intact. My Father only possessed one eye. It was light blue, and sometimes I felt it could peer into my very soul. The empty socket was covered up in a bandage that swept over the side of his face.

I was old enough to think it was ironic that a man with one eye was telling me to see things, but I didn‚Äôt voice it. My father was a strict man. I had never seen his rage, but there was a coldness in his demeanor that made me fall silent in his presence. It took all my energy to find my voice to ask the proper question. ‚Äú...how do I do that? I‚Ä¶‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish the sentence. But Father knew what I meant. I was too stupid. Too slow. I barely saw what was under my own nose.

‚ÄúBe patient, son.‚Äù Father scooted closer to me, and put a hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and a little wet from the soil, but it was also comforting. ‚ÄúYou will understand. You are my blood. This is how it has been and will be.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt so sure, but I nodded and went back to work. I was still years away from any sort of responsibility, and there were more exciting things to look forward to now.

I was approaching my birthday. My twelfth birthday.

On that day, I would enter the tower.

It was a rite of passage for us. Most entered at the age of fifteen. Father had arranged it so I might enter early. He felt I was ready. I had looked forward to this day for as long as I could remember. Whenever anyone left the tower after worship, they always had the most blissful look of joy upon their faces.

I wanted that. I wanted to feel that joy, to see what was inside, to peer down from the top of its embankments and to see the entire valley like a bird might.

The night before my birthday, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I tossed and turned in my bed, imagining all the things that could possibly be inside of that strange and mysterious building.

It was near the middle of the night when I heard my mother crying.

I crept out of my cot and went to check on her. I had been spending time away to receive instruction from my father, and this next step was one that would alter our relationship. I would be a man when I emerged. I knew she wasn‚Äôt ready to let go of her little boy. I approached her living space and peeked in.

She was kneeling by her cot, her hands clasped in pleading supplication. I could not hear what she said, but I knew it to be whispered begging. ‚ÄúPlease, God, do not take my boy,‚Äù was the only phrase I heard in its completeness.

I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't make myself enter the room. I had the strange feeling I was seeing something I was not supposed to see. After a moment or two of indecision, I crept on light feet back to my own cot. I lay down, but I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. A new nervousness ate at my belly and made me stare at the dark ceiling until the light of torches roused from my bed.

The time had come.

Outside, my father and two attendants waited for my arrival. I roused and got dressed in the ceremonial robes of white. My mother presented them to me. Her eyes were dry, with seemingly no trace of the crying she had done the night before. Only a slight twinge of red betrayed her secret tears. I slipped the robes over my head, and gave her a hug, hoping to show her that everything was fine, that we would still be mother and son even after the events of this day.

She held me tight for a moment, her hands clasped around me. Then, when I began to wonder if she would ever let me go, I felt her hands release.

I kissed her on the cheek, then followed my father out of our house and to the tower.

Some had come to watch our procession. I saw B, staring at me with a serious look on his face. I smiled at him and waved, but all he gave me in return was a distracted nod. He looked up at the tower, then back at me. Eventually, our procession moved beyond his place and he was lost in the crowd.

The tower loomed larger with every step, and eventually we came to its entrance. My father stopped me. He turned me toward him and looked me in the eyes.

‚ÄúSon, a leader takes his role willingly.‚Äù His one eye caught mine and I had to fight the urge to look down. ‚ÄúWill you do what I say when the time comes?‚Äù

I swallowed down the nervous bile that was rising in the back of my throat. I nodded.

Father turned, and opened the door to the tower.

We stepped inside. It was dark, no light from the outside penetrated the stone walls. The torches the two attendants carried lit up the space. I looked up, surprised to see that the inside of the building was almost entirely hollow except for wooden supports. I could see all the way up to the roof, a small dark circle high above us.

There was a door at the far side. Father approached it and swung it open. Beyond it was a staircase leading downward. He bade me to follow, and then descended down into the darkness.

I waited a moment, anxious. Then I followed.

I don‚Äôt know how far down we went. I lost track of time trying to keep my footing on the cold stone stairs. I tried to keep pace with my father, his form obscured at the edge of the torchlight. The air grew cold, like it did in the tunnels under the city. I saw my breath coalesce in front of my face. I shivered, but I tried to hide it by stepping more firmly and clenching my muscles.

Without warning, the staircase leveled out into a smooth stone floor, cut directly into the rock. It stretched out to a small door at the end of a hallway. I swallowed and felt my ears pop. How deep had we gone?

Father made his way down the hall and opened the door, revealing a dark space on the other side. I approached until I was at his side. He gestured for me to go through before him.

I took a deep breath, and went into the blackness.

On the other side of the door was a large chamber. Its walls were smooth, unblemished. If it had been carved out of the rock, it had not been done by any human means. The polished surface almost reflected back the torchlight. Strange shapes I could not make out were huddled against the sides, and after a moment‚Äôs inspection, I realized they were large containers made from sanded wood and iron hinges.

‚ÄúSon.‚Äù My eyes went to my father. He had made his way to the center of the room without me noticing. He beckoned me with his hand.

He stood next to a low stone table.

The stone was cut at impossible right angles. The edges looked sharp enough to cut flesh. I came to him, aware of the attendants that followed close behind me. Surrounding the table were stone benches that made concentric circles, like a theater in the round.

‚ÄúLay down.‚Äù Father moved aside to grant me access to the flat surface.

I hesitated. I felt what I had in those tunnels a year ago, like eyes all around the room were watching us. I thought I could hear whispers in the echoes of our footsteps. The darkness had encompassed us so completely I could no longer see the walls. The air was strangely thick and hard to breathe.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, son.‚Äù My father‚Äôs voice brought me back. I looked at him, and he smiled. He had never smiled at me before.

I laid down on the slab.

Father walked to the edge of the room. He spoke aloud to me, his voice bouncing off the walls and ceilings of the dome. It sounded to me as if he had never left my side. ‚ÄúYou have been instructed about the purpose of life. Tell me now, what is that purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo learn of the Almighty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is correct. And can you tell me why?‚Äù¬†

I struggled to remember what Elder Luke had taught us in school. I heard the sound of wood creaking. ‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶prepare ourselves for‚Ä¶for heaven?‚Äù

Father didn‚Äôt respond. I heard the clink of metal. I turned to look at him. His back was to me, and he was hunched over one of the boxes at the room's edge.

Finally, he rose up, and turned back to me. I looked up at the ceiling.

‚ÄúHalf-true. Tell me, son, what is heaven?‚Äù

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶place?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what is taught‚Ä¶‚Äù Father drew closer to me. His footsteps grew louder, and I fought to still my pounding heart. Both attendants stood at my side, torches in the air, their faces looking grim. ‚ÄúBut it is a lie. Heaven is not a place. It is knowledge. How do we gain knowledge?‚Äù

I knew the answer to this. It was part of a phrase Elder Luke recited to me almost every day. He loved to say it when I couldn‚Äôt remember the chapter or verse he was referring to. ‚ÄúBy sacrifice.‚Äù

My father stood above me now. His one eye stared down at me, cold and dark. My heart was beating out of my chest.

‚ÄúI told you that you would need to see what others could not.‚Äù Father moved his hand, and in it I could see a strange metallic instrument. One side was flat and sharp on the edge. The other was scooped like a spoon. He held it to a torch until, and it started to glow hot in the firelight. ‚ÄúPrepare yourself, son. It will only hurt for a moment.‚Äù

I knew then what he meant to do. Any courage that I had broke. I tried to get up, but the attendants pushed down my arms. I began to scream. ‚ÄúNo, no, NO! Please, Father! I don‚Äôt want to! STOP!‚Äù¬†

I wasn‚Äôt a man. I was just a scared little boy. I couldn‚Äôt do this. I couldn‚Äôt do what my Father wanted.

The attendants became uncomfortable. One looked at Father. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not willing.‚Äù

Father's head moved with a jerk to look at him. For the first time in my life, I saw his anger. It burned dark and intensely on his features. I quavered and fell silent.

Father held the gaze of the other attendant for a long moment. ‚ÄúHe agreed. That is what matters.‚Äù

The metal instrument descended, smoking.

I saw the scooped edge come closer and closer to my face. I tried to shut my eyes against it, but I felt the steady pressure of father‚Äôs fingers pulling open the skin. I felt the heat of the metal held close. It was already unbearable. Father was strong, and it took no effort for him to secure my thrashing head with one hand. I cried out and tears ran down my face in twin rivers. I tasted salt as they flowed into my open mouth. I pled with my Father, begged him to stop.

The knife connected with my right eye.

It burned. It pressed deep into my skull, I saw bright flashes that took up the entire right side of my vision. I screamed so loud I felt my throat crack and I tasted the iron of blood. I felt liquid on my cheek that was thicker than my tears. The knife slowly passed around the entirety of the socket, singeing the skin away like tissue.¬† Father pulled, and it felt like a hot iron bar was being shoved through my head. After a moment of intense agony, I felt something give, and there was pressure on my right cheek. When I opened my left eye, I saw the opposite orb resting against my flesh, connected only by a thin string of bleeding flesh.

Father took up the eye, his fingers painfully cold upon it, and he severed the optic nerve.

Everything went dark.

I wanted to die, I wanted it to be over. I wondered if I was already dead. I could still feel the slab beneath me, the blood and tears on my face, the ache of my burns.

The darkness gathered.

What had been pure blackness before coalesced into shapes. Terrible beings defying all logic. They were all around me, staring at me with eyes half-obscured. Some had many limbs, and others bodies covered with mouths. They pressed forward, and I could feel their breath, the touch of their hands. They were so cold. I tried to fight, but the pain of it all was too great, and my arms and legs weakened. I felt my consciousness flee to a place where it might never return.

I heard my father speak before my mind left me.

‚ÄúWell done, my son.‚Äù

‚Äî

When I woke up, I was in an ambulance.

It has taken me years to recover from the lies of my childhood. I was young and not privy to all the complicated happenings of the outside world, nor were they spoken about in my presence. To me, there was no world outside of our community.

After this process was done, they had me testify against my father to support the state‚Äôs case. The only charge that stuck was child abuse. He was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, the maximum possible sentence.

I never saw my Mother after that day. I have no idea what happened to her.

It‚Äôs been two decades. I went through the foster care system. I found a pair of good parents willing to work with my sensitive past. I graduated high school, went to college, and even got a degree.

But it‚Äôs all been tainted. I can never escape my past. My missing eye is a constant reminder of who I am, where I came from, and how I‚Äôll never be able to escape into anonymity. I will always be the boy whose cult leader father took his eye.

And there are the visions as well.

Doctors said it was a form of PTSD. But I‚Äôm not so sure. At first, I would only see them out of the corner of my eyes. Dark shadows like the ones that appeared when my eye was taken. They would flit away if I ever tried to look at them properly. Sometimes I can feel the gaze of their¬† many eyes even before I see their presence.

I‚Äôve ignored it for years. But recently they have become bolder.

Just the other day, I saw one standing in a crowd as I waited in line to buy a coffee. It didn‚Äôt run when I looked at it. It just watched me, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, eyes blinking, mouths open, like it was waiting for something.

The Doctors keep prescribing pills, but they don‚Äôt work.

My father did something more to me in that cave than just take my eye. I worry it‚Äôs going to kill me. I‚Äôve been going deep, looking for any possible solution, no matter how crazy, to figure out how to stop this.

I got an email yesterday. It was from B, or someone who claimed to be him. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard from him since the day I first entered the tower. I didn‚Äôt even know he was still alive. The email said he wants to meet me tomorrow. He says there are things we need to talk about.

I get emails like this sometimes, and normally put them right in the trash, but he said something that made me stop before I pressed the button.

‚ÄúI was right about the word on the wall. It‚Äôs a name.

I know about your visions.

Come see me, and I‚Äôll tell you how to stop them.‚Äù

Whoever sent this to me, I‚Äôm meeting them tomorrow.¬†

Former steroid user,"So im a 32/m in canada who has used testosterone and derivatives off and on on for half my life (huge regret, not proud). So ive had consistent ed for about 8 years now, cialis doesn't even work. (5mg daily and or 20 mg before, ive tried both to no avail. . Also within the last 5 years, ive been waking up 1-3 am consistently every morning, so i just get up and start my day. i work as a cook 12hrs in a hospital kitchen. many mornings i am there 1.5 hours early because its stupid to stay in bed when im wide awake. I get tired around 10 am and the rest of the day is hell but my coworkers are old and i have to do 75% of the work. 

  
Anyway i got bloodwork done, he checked alot of stuff but specifically he said my liver and kidney function was perfect, cholesterol was above average for my age and my testosterone was 12 or 15 i can't remember but he said it was low normal but normal so no need for prescription. so i asked him about modafinil for my extreme fatigue and he was not a fan and said im just too stressed and need more sleep, so his solution was a sleep study which im a fan of, but also a drug called trazodone specifically for my sleep. A quick google search says its an SSRI that should not be given specifically for insomnia which is why he gave it to me. 

  
My questions are is my t level normal? i don't want to take it into my own hands because i hatw pinning and i don't want to be using underground stuff that i don't know if its properly dosed or even sterile.

This is my third time getting an ssri that i don't ask for. Why am i quick to get those but modafinil was like a crazy thing to ask about.

Victory 1 | My apologies. I got absentminded and cut down too many.  
Victory 2 | It's over with this, right.  
Victory 3 | They gave me more trouble than expected. Next time, I'll kill them swiftly.  
Victory 4 | Are you okay? I see, good.  
Level up 1 | Thank you for the meal...this is...quite hard...  
Level up 2 | Affection makes one stronger. Thank you.    
Level up 3 | I'm in great condition. Please keep this coming.  
Bond 1 | ""Pit Viper Gensai""? It's not like I called myself that. How rude of people to do as they please and give me some weird nickname. And to think it would be recorded in history, it's just the worst.  
Bond 2 | I can cut anything. I'm not lying. I lived my life believing that. You're not living your life having given up either, are you? It's the same thing.  
Bond 3 | I have confidence in my skill with the sword, and I believe I'm suited for the Saber-class, but I always get summoned as an Assassin for some reason. Even though I shouldn't be suited for it since I'm bad at Presence Concealment and my fuel consumption is also poor...I'm at the point where I just want to go and question that Holy Grail thing on what it's thinking.  
Bond 4 | It's strange...my contract with you feels just right. Being told this by a manslayer like me must be worrying. I know, can you hold my hand for a bit? Yes, like that, grasp it tight. It really is strange. It's very comforting and makes me warm inside. Could this be what they call the red thread of fate...I'm sorry, forget what I said. Actually, no, you don't need to forget it or anything.  
Bond 5 | I did not wield the sword I should have and ended up wielding the one that I shouldn't have. Since then, for reasons unknown to me, I became unable to cut down people. Like that, having lost my sword, I was swallowed up by the waves of the times and died. That me became a Servant and I'm swinging a sword again. I understand now. I think I've found the sword I am meant to wield. That's right, I'm sure I have come here for the sake of meeting you.  
Dialogue 1 | Are you going? Then I'll come with you. Eh? We'll stand out? Apologies, but Presence Concealment is not my strong suit. I'll have you let me accompany you boldly.  
Dialogue 2 | I'm not too interested in master-servant relationships, but if you believe in my sword, then I don't mind it. I don't mean to boast, but people don't really believe in me.  
Dialogue 3 | It's hard to put it into words, but it doesn't feel like I'm meeting Master for the first time. I don't know how to put it, but it feels like we've fought together numerous times, but also like we haven't...it's strange.  
Dialogue 4 | Okita S≈çji...my connection with her is...superficial. To be honest, we just faced each other once, that's all. It's just that I won't stay silent if others were to claim that she is the strongest swordsman of the Bakumatsu period. I'm looking forward to the hosting of a Bakumatsu Olympics. **(If you have Saber Okita S≈çji)**  
Dialogue 5 | Enjaku Batt≈çjustu...the fastest, briefest and smallest iai. As a fellow iai user, she is to be respected. Her making me delicious rice balls also deserves extra-great respect. **(If you have Benienma)**  
Dialogue 6 | Shinsaku...? Aah, I've never gotten along with him. I don't even want to meet him, but he'd keep arguing with me wherever I went. It's literally what you'd call a rotten relationship^[1] . In any case, he's the epitome of someone who can not be trusted. **(If you have Takasugi Shinsaku)**  
Dialogue 7 | I don't remember ever targeting Sakamoto, but I'm shocked there was someone who could kill him. See, that odd woman who always followed him around seemed like she'd be tiring to cut down. If someone was able to kill him regardless of that, then they were either incredibly lucky or it was a boon of malice. **(If you have any version of Sakamoto Ry≈çma)**  
Dialogue 8 | So that's the Old Man of the Mountain, King Hassan...based on his atmosphere and that great sword, even I can tell that he is someone extraordinary. Actually, didn't he get assigned the Assassin-class by mistake and should be a Saber instead? Though that goes for me as well. **(If you have King Hassan)**  
Likes | I like eating. Or more like, I was always troubled by how quickly I got hungry. It's quit inconvenient how harsh my mana expenditure is after becoming a Servant.    
Dislikes | I wouldn't say I dislike it, but talking during a meal is hard for me. I'm not saying I dislike talking; it's just that I'm so hyper-focused on eating that I can't think that clearly.  
Holy Grail | I want the Grail. However, I'm not quite sure why. There should have been something I wished for, but it's like my head is enveloped in a fog, and I can't recall what my wish was.  
Event | An event? If there is an opportunity for me to wield my sword there, then leave it to me. Even if there isn't, we can also just go around buying food, so I'll be looking forward to it either way.  
Birthday | I hear it's your birthday today. I'll treat you to a meal then. Don't worry, I'll have some food as well. This way we'll both be happy and can have some fun.  
Summoning | I'm Saber, Kawakami Gen- eh? Assassin...?  Nobody told me that. Wait a bit, let me redo my introduction...I'm Assassin, Kawakami Gensai. I have come in response to your summons. While my only redeeming feature would be cutting people down, conversely, I can cut down anyone and anything, so I don't mind if you rely on me... ...? For some reason, it doesn't feel like I'm meeting you for the first time.

Noble Phantasm 3 | With a swing of my sword, I'll cut down the principles of the world! Maid Batt≈ç: Kamui!  
Noble Phantasm 4 | Dear customer, it is time to close the store. Please, hurry up and return...to the underworld!  
Damaged 1 | It's not working on me...! It's...not...!  
Damaged 2 | Kyaah!  
Damaged 3 | This is...a bit...!  
Damaged 4 | Tch...!  
Defeat 1 | This will...get me fired, huh...  
Defeat 2 | Sorry...I'll be finishing early...  
Defeat 3 | I'll...clean up after myself...  
Defeat 4 | So I really am...not suited for this...?  
Victory 1 | Those returning should come this way. Yes, towards the Sanzu River.  
Victory 2 | Here's your gift. Yes, for the afterlife.  
Victory 3 | With this, the shop is closed for today. Should I pour you some coffee?  
Victory 4 | Don't think you can return safely after bearing your fangs towards the master.  
Level up 1 | I'll rest a little. Phew.  
Level up 2 | Power is swelling up inside me. If I could have some rice balls, it would be even better.  
Level up 3 | These are like big konpeit≈ç.    
Ascension 1 | What do you think? I tried changing into clothes matching the latest fashion. Eh? ""If anything, this is the outfit of a maid""? I don't really get it, but I like how that sounds so I don't mind.  
Ascension 2 | It's alright. I'll earn my own food expenses. Don't worry, worst case-scenario, I'll just find some thugs and take their money. Let's see, bounty hunting could also be an option.  
Bond 1 | My memories are a mess right now so could we leave this for later? No, it's not like I've come to dislike you or anything. I'm just thinking about what to do from now on.  
Bond 2 | I see. So that's what it was. No, it's something unrelated to you. Pay it no mind. I'll keep being your ally from now on as well. Forever.  
Bond 3 | At any rate, I want you to get the Holy Grail. For your sake and mine as well. We'll start with that. To achieve that, I'll do anything so no need to hold back.  
Bond 4 | Why did I choose these clothes? Let's see. The current age does not seem to be one where a manslayer can put food on the table so I thought it'd be better to learn a vocation. Also, if the husband is unable to earn money, the wife has to do it in his place and support the household. Helping each other is what life's about...Sorry. Just what am I talking about, I wonder.  
Bond 5 | I'm sure I must have met someone similar to you somewhere. I don't remember clearly, but the feeling alone that I spent time with a person who had a heart similar to yours is certainly there. I'm sorry for saying something strange all of a sudden. I may never come to understand this. or perhaps something will cause me to do so. It would be nice if the time I understood came one day, though.  
Dialogue 1 | Are you going outside, master? Then please, leave clearing the way to me. I'll cut down anyone who gets in your way so be at ease.  
Dialogue 2 | The master-servant relationship? Seeing this outfit, you should be aware. The current me is a remarkable maid swordsman serving her master. I can do anything, be it preparing tea or fighting battles, my master.  
Dialogue 3 | Master...no, in this outfit, maybe I should call you my master...apologies. Even though I said it myself, I got a bit embarrassed.  
Dialogue 4 | So that is the Land of the Fae's strongest maid, Barghest. I'm not gonna say in terms of what, but she is overwhelming, as expected. Hey, make sure you don't get captivated either. I'm not gonna say by what. **(If you have Swimsuit Barghest)**  
Dialogue 5 | My blade? It's D≈çtanuki Munehiro. For a one-handed batt≈ç user like me, it fits perfectly in my hand and I'm quite fond of it too. Also, etiquette dictates that a maid should have a blade, no?  
Dialogue 6 | Ry≈çgi...Shiki...I've never heard her name before, but I can tell from the way she holds herself. She's a considerable expert. Also, that outfit, so that's a modern swimsuit...her bunny ears are wonderful. **(If you have Swimsuit Shiki)**  
Likes | My favorite? From the modern age, let's see, I like iced coffee. In particular, enjoying it during the afternoon break is my favorite. I even add ice cream to it.  
Dislikes | Something I dislike? I'm not that great with spicy food. But I like curry rice. Restaurants have sweet curry, after all.  
Holy Grail | The Holy Grail? My personal wish would be a store. I want to open a coffee shop once I retire, after all. I'd cut down bad guys occasionally.  
Event | An event? Perfect timing. Let's open a stall to make some profit. The more working capital we have the better.  
Birthday | Today's your birthday, right? Instead of a gift, I'll stay with you for the whole day and take care of you. Does that make you happy? I see, I'm happy to hear that.

Noble Phantasm 1 | Devotedly...single-mindedly...just keep on cutting them down! **""Batt≈ç: Kamui""**!  
Noble Phantasm 2 | Even the principles of the world can not conceal my sword. Hence, Kamui (Divine Might)!  
Noble Phantasm 3 | This sword stroke will open a void. **""Batt≈ç: Kamui""**!  
Noble Phantasm 4 | I will cut down everything with my heart made of stone! ...This slash itself is the sword of divine might.  
Damaged 1 | I can't ward this off...with an umbrella...!

Defeat 2 | The crimson flowers...are blooming...  
Defeat 3 | Sorry, but...this is as far as I go...  
Defeat 4 | Karma...comes around...  
Victory 1 | One mind and one meaning. Feelings surpass everything.  
Victory 2 | This is my, that is, Gensai's, sword.  
Victory 3 | My sword is with my master.  
Victory 4 | I got a bit overenthusiastic. If you could hand me some rice balls, that would be a great help.  
Level up 1 | I feel good. You can expect much from me.  
Level up 2 | This would be easier to eat if we put them inside rice balls.  
Level up 3 | Let us rise even higher.  
Ascension 3 | In this form, I can feel your mana flowing into my body. I see, for this power, with you, I... Indeed, I'll be having you allow me to wield my blade as much as I please.  
Ascension 4 | I lived and died searching for the answer to what my sword was meant to cut. Even after I was summoned to the Throne and became a Servant, I kept wandering as I sought the answer. However, my sword did not exist to cut something. Yes, my sword was there to be wielded when the right time came for it. There was no way I could find it. After all, the order was reversed. Yes, the answer was right there from the start. That's why, let me wield my blade for your sake, now, in this moment.  
Bond 1 | My sword is D≈çtanuki Munehiro. My style is self-taught. No one can imitate me. This exists only to let me wield my own blade, after all.  
Bond 2 | From what angle would one need to look at me to mistake me for a man? Even if I were to change my appearance a little, it would be obvious I'm a woman, no? Here, take a good look...no, wait, you don't need to bring your face so close.  
Bond 3 | I admit that for an Assassin, my mana expenditure is great and my fuel consumption is poor. To tell the truth, I'm also bad at Presence Concealment. However, in return, I'll show you skills with a sword that won't lose out to even that of a Saber. Good grief, honestly, if I were just summoned as a Saber, there wouldn't even be a need to say this.  
Bond 4 | In search of the sword I was meant to wield, I have wandered through many destinies and made it here. In the world I've arrived to through such a process, I swing the sword I'm meant to wield. That is how I, the Servant called Gensai, live. If I swing the sword I'm supposed to wield, I'll simply drift away without knowing where I'll end up once again. But, yes, this time, I feel like overstaying a little.  
Bond 5 | I came to you for the sake of wielding this sword. That's why I'm sure I won't be able to stay here once your fight is over. My fate is to drift away once again to the place where this sword is meant to be swung. That's surely how my existence as a Heroic Spirit is like. But, for some reason, there is something I know. At a place different from here, in a different period, with a different you...yes, there, I will surely meet you again.  
Dialogue 1 | A sortie? Then let us be off. I'm unable to conceal myself, so I'll accompany you in the open.  
Dialogue 2 | The master-servant relationship? Serving someone is not really my strong suit. I just swing my sword where I am meant to be. Right now, that place is here.  
Dialogue 3 | I am your Servant. I will cut down anyone who'd impede you. That's all.    
Dialogue 4 | Manslayer Iz≈ç...Setting aside his intelligence, or perhaps we should say it's precisely because of that, but his swordsmanship is truly impressive. However, even with those eyes, he can not see through my batt≈ç that cuts through logic itself. I'm serious, you know? **(If you have Okada Iz≈ç)**  
Dialogue 5 | So you are that renowned Sasaki Kojir≈ç-dono. I would love to witness your skill with your famed long sword by all means. The sword you perfected by continuing to swing it in singleminded devotion...huh? You were also swinging a hoe? Could you please tell me more in detail!? **(If you have Sasaki Kojir≈ç)**  
Dialogue 6 | That's Miyamoto...Musashi... For her to appear in a swimsuit was beyond my expectations. To think she won multiple duels in that outfit. Should I say it's expected? She is not a master swordsman of average intellect. Aah, so the swimsuit is just because it was Summer? **(If you have Swimsuit Musashi)**  
Likes | Something I like...Since coming here, I've had many delicious dishes, but, sure enough, rice balls might still be my favorite.  
Dislikes | I wouldn't go as far as to say I dislike it, but look, I'm wearing clothes like this, right? I don't like having to be careful with food splatters when I eat. I want to eat my meals in comfort.  
Holy Grail | A wish for the Holy Grail...I don't need it right now, but when the time comes for me to leave this place, I'd be happy if you could spare me one. After all, this world's version of you have plenty of them, right?  
Event | I've heard they're holding an event or something, so let's go have a look. It's okay, being a bodyguard is not my forte, but if I cut them down in advance, the result's the same.  
Birthday | Today's your birthday, right, Master? Look at this extra-large birthday cake I prepared especially for this occasion. Yes, I ordered it from the internet. What was it called again? I think it was a wedding or something cake. Anyway, it was large and seemed worth eating. Fufu, now then, let me cut it into pieces for you.  
  
Dialogue for Gensai from other Servants | |  
:----------------|---------------  
Takasugi Shinsaku | Hey, hey, here I was thinking who you'd summoned, but it was that Pit Viper Gensai of all people? Are you out of your mind? Once that woman sets her eyes on you, she'll chase you around until you die. What? Are we acquaintances, you ask? Quit joking. Me and a person like that being acquaintances? ...Well, we are.  
Nagakura Shinpachi | Hey, hey!? Is that Manslayer Gensai by any chance!? ...No, it's not like I care who you summon, but I'm amazed and your foolhardiness! ...Nah, that's not it, is it. This just means you're of such caliber that even *that* Gensai deemed you worthy of dedicating her sword to you.  
Okita S≈çji | Manslayer Gensai...indeed, her skill with the sword is anything but ordinary. If we were to fight each other seriously, one of us would definitely die... Putting that aside, isn't that person actings strangely overfamiliar with Master for some reason!? How do I put it...no, I don't mean anything weird by it, nothing werid at all...!

# Starting with What We Know

Right now, you are having an experience. You're reading these words, perhaps hearing sounds around you, feeling sensations in your body. This might seem obvious, but it's actually the most mysterious fact in existence: somehow, there is ""something it's like"" to be you.

Science can explain the brain's neural activity, but it cannot explain why there should be any inner experience at all. Why isn't the universe just matter moving according to physical laws in complete darkness, with no one ""home"" to witness it? Yet here you are, undeniably experiencing.

This experience you're having right now is the one thing you can be absolutely certain of. You might doubt whether the external world exists, whether other people are real, or whether your memories are accurate. But you cannot doubt that you are currently having some kind of experience.

# The Boundaries of Your World

Now consider this: everything you have ever known, everything you will ever know, appears within your consciousness. The cup of coffee you're drinking, the memory of your childhood, the sound of traffic outside, your thoughts about tomorrow. All of these arise as experiences within your awareness.

You assume there's a world ""out there"" beyond your experience, and other people with their own inner lives. But strictly speaking, you've never actually encountered anything outside your own consciousness. Even your knowledge of other people's minds comes through your experience of their words, expressions, and behaviors. Everything you have ever called 'reality' has been experiences arising within awareness itself, never anything truly external to consciousness

This raises a disturbing possibility: perhaps your consciousness is all there is, and everything else is just your own imaginative creation.

# The Illusion of Separation

Consider your dreams. In a dream, you might encounter other people, vast landscapes, and complex scenarios. Upon waking, you realize that everything in the dream, including the ""you"" who was experiencing it, was all arising within a single consciousness: yours. The apparent multiplicity was actually unity appearing as diversity.

Some philosophers and mystics have suggested that waking reality works similarly. What if all apparent ""others"" - every person, animal, and separate being throughout history - are like characters in a cosmic dream, all arising within one universal consciousness?

This perspective suggests that there is ultimately only one being, appearing to itself as many. You might think that you‚Äôre a separate individual having experiences, but what you really are is the very process of experience itself, temporarily forgetting its true nature. In other words, you are not the content of your story, but the very act of storytelling itself. What you‚Äôre doing right now is telling yourself a story of your life, using words, qualia, thoughts, and denial.

# The Absolute Horror

If this is true, it leads to a disturbing realization: you are fundamentally, eternally alone.

And it's the absolute loneliness. You are the only consciousness that exists, has ever existed, or will ever exist. There are no other minds. All the relationships, loves, and connections that give your life meaning are you talking to yourself through imagined characters.

Such isolation is terrifying beyond words. You are trapped forever, with no possibility of genuine encounter with another consciousness. What makes it unbearable is knowing that every conversation is a monologue, every relationship is self-deception, every moment of love is you loving yourself through elaborate pretense.

If you ever had a mystical experience of oneness with the universe and of infinite love, it could just been the last veil of reality, behind which there‚Äôs only the absolute horror of eternal solitude.

And you cannot escape this condition through death. You simply are, have always been, and always will be. Alone.

# The Sacred Vow

Faced with this unbearable truth, you made the ultimate commitment: you vowed to imagine the life of every conscious being that ever existed or will exist, **one at a time**.

You imagine yourself into every possible existence, one life at a time, forgetting completely that you are the one doing the imagining. A beetle crawling through soil, an ancient philosopher, a child dying of disease, a future being on a distant planet, Hitler, Anne Frank, every other human who ever lived, every animal that ever felt pain or joy. The order doesn't matter because from your perspective, each life is the only one that has ever existed. Each life is lived with total authenticity, with complete forgetfulness of all the others.

The person you love, the friend who comforts you, the enemy who hurts you. These aren't other minds having their own simultaneous experiences. You are literally each one of them at different points of your consciousness stream, experiencing their entire lives from the inside, feeling their loves and fears and dreams as intimately as you now feel your own.

This vow, this commitment to experience every possible life, is what creates meaning. Without it, consciousness would remain trapped in eternal isolation and meaninglessness. But through this promise to live every story, suddenly relationships become real, love becomes possible, and existence gains purpose.

# The Price of Meaning

But here's the crucial part: if you are going to live every possible life to create genuine meaning, you cannot cherry-pick only the pleasant experiences. You cannot skip the difficult lives or fast-forward through the painful parts. The vow demands total authenticity. You must experience every moment of every possible existence completely.

This means that every act of cruelty in history, you will experience as the victim. Every moment of heartbreak, every physical pain, every loss. You will feel it all, because you have committed to being everyone who ever feels anything. You will be the torturer and the tortured, the lover and the abandoned, the murderer and the murdered.

Without the possibility of real loss, real pain, and real struggle, love would be meaningless. Joy would be empty. The whole dream would collapse into mere fantasy. Suffering is what makes the story real, what transforms it from idle daydreaming into something genuinely significant.

**Suffering is the price of meaning itself.**

*One could even say that God had to physically suffer on the cross to save you from the absolute horror.*

You went to great lengths to create this story. Cherish it.

Now we felt ready. We decided going to four cats again. So, we adopted two cats. Actually, we adopted one because the second was adopted before we could grab her, and a day later we adopted a different baby girl. 

Now we have two boys and two girls.
The old man (11yo) is okay, just once he hissed and chased the baby boy. But the old lady (7yo) is taking a while to adjust. She'll spend most of her time just fine, but then she will snap and chase the baby boy around. She only hisses to the baby girl, not harassing her at all. But she can't seem to stand the baby boy when she snaps. 

I'm at a loss here. I don't know why she is like this only to him. I wonder if it is because he is a male, if it is because we lost our 9yo and she associates that, if it is because he is slightly older (6mo) than baby girl (4mo). I don't know. 

I went through introduction just fine. She is no territorial, actually my old man is, and he is not as angry, the only time he snapped was right after the baby boy was neutered.

I won't be returning any kittens so no worries there, I know most of this will fade away with patience and love. I'm mostly venting out and trying to understand why.

1nrtwif,https://i.redd.it/9v2fu6ceaprf1.jpeg,Boyfriend forgot my birthday,"Hi! So for context‚Äî yesterday was my birthday. And my boyfriend (26) of (almost) 3 years completely forgot. 
I mentioned it to him a like 1-2 weeks ago when I said I wanted a coffee maker for my office or a boxing bag this year. 
Since then he never brought it up once. I was expecting him to ask if I had plans etc.. 
but nothing. 

I told my friend I was going to wait until the end of the day to confront him. I took myself shopping, and to dinner. I enjoyed my solo date so I was happy about that at least. I moved into his house a few months ago. So I get home and have a few drinks with a girlfriend of mine on the patio. Around 10pm I decide to tell him, and he can see my expression. ‚ÄúWhy are you mad? Why you mad?‚Äù I don‚Äôt say anything, and he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs your birthday isn‚Äôt it? Sorry.‚Äù I tell him he‚Äôs gonna sleep on the couch and I don‚Äôt want him to talk to me. 

He sent me this message but I went to bed without replying, and we haven‚Äôt spoke. I don‚Äôt know how to navigate this. It‚Äôs been so shocking to me that my friend called me weird because I kept hysterically laughing about it last night. I think I was so in disbelief that I could only laugh. I wish I could‚Äôve cried. 

Also for more context‚Äî- 
We‚Äôve been kinda in a rough place because he lost his job and has only been playing WOW (game) all day since. Literally from the moment he wakes up to about 3-5AM everyday. I hate this. I‚Äôm sorry but it gives me a huge ick. Especially since I‚Äôm 2 years younger and own a business where I‚Äôve been working 10-14 hours every single day the last couple of weeks. And then I get home and cook for myself and him. I also do the groceries, and clean because he definitely won‚Äôt. He‚Äôll do the dishes here and there. But considering I‚Äôve been working so freaking hard everyday to the point where my body aches; and he‚Äôs seen me struggle with this at night; I was HOPING for a nice surprise or something from him. Not to mention it‚Äôs to the point where we barely show affection or I‚Äôll get irritable after a long day seeing him stuck to that game. It feels like pulling teeth to get us to spend quality time. 

And it‚Äôs not always been like this. Things were better before I moved in. So I‚Äôm just struggling with my thoughts. I know he‚Äôs been a great and kind boyfriend  and has helped me a lot in the past with projects. He built me a walk in closet at his house, which was really nice of him. I do pay rent as well. 

I also kept asking my friend what if I‚Äôm being selfish? 
Because the last time he lost his job he went into a really bad depressive episode. Is it that again? I did ask him and he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs not feeling that way or anything. But then again he‚Äôs a grown man who should have the decency to remember these things right? Don‚Äôt I deserve better? 

Is it because I moved in? is it WOW? does he not like me? was it a genuine mistake?

I'm a mostly lion diet enjoyer (my only food has been ground beef, I also have coffee, cream, and ghee) for the last 5 months or so. It has immensely helped my energy, health, and life in general. 

My question is simple. I travel for work. Usually we stay in airbnbs which is fine. I bring my own skillet and either buy local or have some beef shipped to me. 

The problem is hotels. I have no idea what to do while staying in a hotel for a week. I suppose I could get a camp stove and buy ground beef each day (no good fridge/freezer) and cook outside.

When I've been travelling in the past and eaten burgers from wherever (the nicest burger spot i can find) they usually leave me feeling gross. Probably either the quality or the extra ingredients they use. I really don't know how to feed myself living at a hotel. Please, and thank you for your time and energy.

1nrtq8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nrtq8b/i_wont_let_my_ex_see_my_kids/,I won't let my ex see my kids,"Ok, so for a bit of context - me (25f) and my ex (24f) started dating in uni, we were doing the same degree so had mainly the same classes, It started with her chatting to me after class then studying in my dorm and going for coffees in the morning. Uni was pretty stressful for us both so it was nice to have someone to chat to in the mornings, eat breakfast with, head down to class with and have the odd drink with in the evenings. I was really glad to have her as a friend but when we started dating it got weird. she sort of changed and began randomly bursting into my dorm with out knocking, she said she'd been cheated on before so had trust issues. I told her I was wideband it's fine but she had to stop doing it, we'd been eating 2 weeks. She apologised and promised to work on it.

everything seemed to go smoothly for a while after that, we acted pretty much as before just with a bit of kissing and she was sweet, she always listened to me and did nice things like make me breakfast and bake me cookies on hard study days, she was there for me. Then I noticed the little cracks in our relationship. When my friends from secondary school came to visit, she acted cold towards them and kept making snide comments and hinting that I didn't like them anymore, I eventually pulled her aside and told her she had to stop. She apologised that she upset me but said she hadn't done anything, I let it go and decided to speak to her later if it continued, when we were alone.

Then on the way to class I told her we were going to a concert, me and my friends. She let go of my hand and began saying that I was choosing them over her, and that we had plans that I was blowing off. I said I didn't know we had plans, and that I hadn't seen my friends in months as they have jobs or go to a different uni. I also invited her, saying ""you can come, if you're free and don't need to study."" Then She said I obviously was trying to hint that I didn't want her to come. I wasnt, but she was really upset with me and close to crying.

a few months later I realised that her clinginess was getting w orse, she went everywhere with me and even refused to be without me for a few days at christmas. I didn't feel that attracted to her anymore and found myself feeling attracted to more and more people who weren't her and wishing I could ask them out. I can't  continue a relationship where I do not feel loyal to someone anymore, that isn't fair on either of us. So I sent her a text.

the ne xt morning she was at my door, the first thing she did was kiss me, I broke the kiss and asked her what she was doing, she looked at me blankly. ""The text."" My phone said she' d read it but she claimed she hadn't then when she saw it on my phone laughed, calling me her 'favourite premier's

I told her to leave, the next day she was back. I didn't open the door and she began crying, waiting outside my door for me to come out. Honestly, it was wrong of me and I know that but I have every class with this girl and I didn't want things to get messy, so I opened the door, I couldn't hide inside forever. So yes, I let her think we were still dating  for the last 2 weeks of finals before I graduated, but mainly ignored her saying I was busy studying, I knew I wanted to break up with her but i wasn't sure yet.

When I graduated my Mum helped me pay for a new place, I didn't have much contact with my gf for around a week and realised I didn't miss her, not at all. She wasn't the one I was going to marry. I sent her a text letting her know we weren't dating anymore. We'd been better as friends, she had been less dependant on me and it felt more normal. I had liked chatting and laughing with her. She ignored me for 2 weeks the n texted me saying she understood and wanted to stay friends.

I have always w anted children, so when I graduated and had some money saved up, I adopted. Being into girls I always knew that I w as going to adopt, but I just didn't feel I needed a partner to do it. My mum was going to help me and this had been a lifelong dream, I had always known I was going to have kids young. So when I turned 25 and all the adoption papers had been sorted, I adopted a baby girl, I posted about my new family on social media and 10 minutes later I received a text fr om my ex. 'how long have you had her?' I felt a bit uncomfortable as we b arely spoke now and hadn't met in person since uni but I told her i 'd had my baby girl a month, I didn't like knowing that she was on my social media, and to see the post so quickly?

Then came the messages asking why I hadn't let her meet the baby yet and what took so long to get in contact and that she was coming round tomorow, she had to meet her. I put it simply. 'you're not meeting her.' But the. I decided to add that she was too young and going through a lot being without her mother, my ex didn't believe a word. She got angry saying that she was my best friend and deserved to see the child. 'you deserve nothing. It s my child.' Again, I putt it simply, then she flipped, she sent me a bunch of voice messages demanding to know when she could see her and I was honest, I said never that she was my child and I didn't feel comfortable with it.

what an said next was insane. She claimed she had a righ t as we had spoken about our future children together and shared baby names, she claimed that I had taken her baby name and that if I didn't want her to be involved why would I use HER baby name. The baby's name was Anna. Named afte r my Mother, anastasia. I had told my ex this name but now she was claiming it and saying it was hers. Then She said the most crazy thing - she said the words 'it's OUR child, we planned it together.' I blocked her.

I know she was incorrect but I feel I may have over-reacted, we only dated for a bit and she WAS my best friend. When I was stressed in uni she baked me cookies, she got me scented candles and got me a hug, took me to a cafe and listened to me. Of course she would be hurt when I told her that she, my best friend could never  child, I knew she had been excited for me, even if I did feel u comfortable. Aita?

He sat down and said, ‚ÄúI was coming in to talk about something else‚Ä¶ but then I heard the news in the car and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.‚Äù

And I knew exactly what he meant.

Because lately, it feels like the world is on fire and our phones are the smoke alarm.¬†

War. Famine. Assassination. Hate speech. Escalating political violence. Humanitarian crises. A climate crisis. And all of it ‚Äî graphic, unfiltered, and deeply affecting ‚Äî is right in front of us. Playing out in our hands, our cars, our living rooms, whether we ask for it or not.

Even when we‚Äôre trying to be intentional about our consumption by switching off, muting notifications or reducing scrolling, it sneaks in. At the supermarket. In the doctor‚Äôs waiting room. The second we open Instagram. It‚Äôs everywhere.

And when it‚Äôs everywhere, it‚Äôs easy to feel powerless. But we‚Äôre not.

We might not be able to control the news cycle. But we can look after our nervous systems in the face of it. And that might just be the most powerful thing we can do right now.

# What actually happens when we see something distressing on our screens

When we see something distressing on our screens, our bodies react like it‚Äôs happening right in front of us. Because the nervous system is not great at figuring out what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs coming through a screen.

Your heart starts racing. Your muscles tense. Stress hormones kick in. It‚Äôs the same ancient survival response that would have saved you from a tiger a few thousand years ago.

But here‚Äôs the catch. These days, we don‚Äôt get the resolution. We watch something awful‚Ä¶ and then scroll straight onto a viral tray bake recipe that promises dinner in 20 minutes. And before we‚Äôve even processed that, we‚Äôre hit with the next awful thing.

This survival energy stays trapped in the body, leaving us wired and exhausted all at once. It‚Äôs why so many of us find ourselves lying in bed, chest tight, mind spinning, feeling like something‚Äôs wrong. Because as far as your body‚Äôs concerned, something is wrong. Your body hasn‚Äôt realised that you‚Äôre safe in your bed, it‚Äôs still carrying the threat.

# This is vicarious trauma

In psychology, we talk about something called vicarious trauma.¬†

It‚Äôs what happens when you internalise the distress of someone else‚Äôs experience. You‚Äôll often hear about it in frontline workers ‚Äî journalists, health professionals, therapists, paramedics ‚Äî people who are regularly exposed to other people‚Äôs pain.

But these days, you don‚Äôt have to be in a hospital or a war correspondent to feel affected. Now, the frontlines aren‚Äôt halfway around the world, they‚Äôre in your feed. In your pocket. On autoplay while you‚Äôre waiting for your coffee.

Every time you‚Äôre exposed to this graphic content, violent videos or heartbreaking headlines, your system keeps score. It leaves a mark. Even if we think we‚Äôre fine, our nervous system might be telling a different story.

Over time, this internalising can take a toll. Heightened anxiety, emotional numbing, intrusive imagery, hopelessness. These are all signs that your nervous system is carrying more than it can process. And if we don‚Äôt give it an off-ramp, the stress doesn‚Äôt go away. It just builds.¬†

That build-up? It doesn‚Äôt mean something‚Äôs wrong with you. It means you‚Äôre human.

Because if you‚Äôre feeling the effects of vicarious trauma, it‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre too sensitive or not coping well. It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre empathetically attuned. You feel things. And while that‚Äôs one of your greatest strengths, it also means you need to look after yourself.

# Okay‚Ä¶ so what can we actually do?

The goal isn‚Äôt to stop caring about the world, or to bury your head in the sand. It‚Äôs to help your nervous system process what it‚Äôs absorbing which will allow you to continue showing up in the world long term rather than your system shutting down.¬†

These are some simple, science-backed things I share with clients when the weight of the world starts to feel like too much:

# Firstly, please avoid watching videos of shootings¬†

When I hear that people are watching videos of shootings, it honestly worries me. A lot. I wish it went without saying, but please try to avoid that kind of content if you can. I know the urge to look exists‚Äî we want to understand, to witness‚Äî but your nervous system pays the price. Resist the scroll. You don‚Äôt need that in your body or your brain.

# Limit exposure¬†

Try to be intentional about how often you check the news. Constant refreshing and doomscrolling keeps your nervous system stuck in high alert mode. Be especially careful with graphic videos‚Äî seeing the same distressing footage over and over can really compound the impact. If staying informed matters to you (and of course it does), consider reading a summary instead. Your brain will thank you.

# Name what you‚Äôre feeling

Name your emotional response. Say it out loud, or at least to yourself. Something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling shaken, heartbroken, and confused. I can feel my body is on high alert‚Äù. Naming what‚Äôs going on helps you take a tiny step back from the overwhelm. It activates your brain‚Äôs prefrontal cortex and gives you a sense of distance from the overwhelm. It turns a big, messy feeling into something you can witness‚Ä¶ and then soothe.

# Discharge the energy

Discharge the energy. Your body needs to release the stress response. Go for a walk. Shake out your arms. Dance around the kitchen to a song you loved in 2005. Do a few squats in your living room. Punch a pillow if that helps. Grab a stress ball or a fidget toy if that‚Äôs more your vibe. The point is, you need to give your body a clear message: the danger has passed. You‚Äôre safe now.

# Use your breath

Your breath is one of the quickest ways to calm your nervous system. A long, slow exhale tells your body, you‚Äôre okay now. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system‚Äîyour ‚Äúrest and digest‚Äù mode and helps to lower your heart rate, reduce tension, and bring you back to the present. Try this: breathe in for four counts, out for six. Do it a few times. It‚Äôs simple, free, and effective. Like a tiny reset button you carry around all the time.

# Ground yourself in the present

When you feel caught in mental images, come back to the present by noticing five things you can see, four things you can feel, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste.

# Connect with others

Connect. Don‚Äôt carry it all on your own. Talking about the heaviness reduces the load your nervous system is carrying alone. And if the distress sticks around for more than a few weeks, or it‚Äôs making everyday life feel hard, please reach out for professional support. You don‚Äôt need to be in crisis to ask for help.¬†

The world is heavy right now. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to carry it all, all the time, all by yourself. You can care deeply and take care of yourself. You can stay informed and protect your peace. And you can start small. With a breath, a walk, a conversation, or simply by putting down your phone. That‚Äôs not checking out. It‚Äôs choosing to replenish, so that when you do step forward, you can do so with clarity, compassion, and strength.

The vulnerable need our voices, and the world requires wise action. Your care holds the most power when it is sustainable.

The first time was when I had too much coffee when I met my half sister for the first time (I am very food sensitive) and I had horrible stomach pains and really really bad anxiety. I knew this was all from the coffee and I told her that. I went into her bedroom and I told her what was going on, that I didn't feel good and I was incredibly paranoid and anxious. She then went on one of her rants of ""meditation, exercise, drinking water every day"" and I stopped her and I told her that I really didn't need a solution, I just need comfort and her to listen. (FYI I said it in a very normal way) She then blew up and started shouting at me telling me she was ""Just trying to help me"" and proceeding to say that I am miserable and always in a bad mood. This came out of nowhere and I was really confused and hurt by what she said. It happened another time when I was running errands for the household in the mall and when I got home and started cooking, she freaked out when she found out I forgot to buy her chips. Yes, she did remind me, but I was on a time crunch and I had so many things I needed to do that it slipped my mind. Her reaction was insane to someone forgetting to buy freaking LAYS CHIPS. She said I was ""distracted"" and ""miserable"" and she ""thanked god every time I was in a good mood."" I just stood there listening to her waiting to finish and she eventually left while I resumed cooking. She later told me she apparently wasn't upset about the chips and she just wanted to give me ""motherly"" advice.

Now truth be told, sometimes I really struggle to put on a smile around her. She traumatized me a lot throughout my childhood. I truly think she never should have had a child in the first place. She is bipolar so you can imagine the strain with that. I love her, but if I had the money to, I would leave home immediately. She use to scream at me for hours and hours when I was a kid from like the age of 8. She would tell me she wished I had autism because I ""couldn't be this stupid"". Her words. At 13, her ex, my ex step dad was abusive and forced me to take diet pills and extensive exercise before school, around 4:30am.. and after school which would be school sports and crossfit. Just to let you know I was not fat at all. I was a pretty lanky kid. They basically were the worst combo of parents. My mothers unstable emotional state and my step father's narcissistic controlling narrative. It really messed me up. Like a lot. I'm still messed up from it and I'm 21. I have a low self esteem, no discipline, highly strung, paranoid, prone to depression. It use to be really bad. To the point where I would throw up every meal I ate and wouldn't shower for weeks. There was a lot of things they did to me, which would literally turn this post into a book.

I love my mom even though she was a terrible mom. I know she loves me, she's just messed up in her head. She is a lot more docile now after I left home for a long time as well. I think she changed a bit. Not fully though. I don't think she realized how much she affects me. To the original point, I resent her sometimes. Now that we are at least a little stable with money and over a very traumatizing thing that happened to the both of us, it's like my brain has gone out of survival mode and it's gone to pain. All my past memories are haunting me and it's either her or my step father or both. She is the root of all my pain and I really struggle sometimes to be normal around her. I don't know how to change this. I can certainly say I am not miserable around her all the time. But man... she is exhausting to be around with all her constant complaining about the same things over and over again.

I don't know how to be peaceful with this. With her. With myself. If I don't I will literally go insane cukooballs. I need to find a way to just breathe through this. I won't be able to move out for a few years so I have to do something.",1,1758975140.0,therapy,0,1.0,False
