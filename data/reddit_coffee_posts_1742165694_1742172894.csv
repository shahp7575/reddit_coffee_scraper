1jd0ij0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1jd0ij0/getting_promoted_is_the_worst_thing_that_has/,Getting promoted is the worst thing that has happened to me,"I just need to vent this. Work has never caused so much stress to me in my life before.

A few months back, our manager (presumably overloaded with stress) opened up a new role, an Assisting Manager role which was offered to a bunch of us who worked there internally. We are a team of 7 and 3 of us applied for the role and I was the one that got it. What seemed like a nice pay increase and a little extra responsibility for my CV has just resulted in absolute hell for me.

Prior to my promotion, we have always bonded over a general distaste for our manager. She is a but of a micromanager, not overly friendly, no interest in speaking to any of us about anything non-work related, and generally always has a lot of criticisms to make with very little offering of positive feedback. She has been the result of a high number of people leaving. However, it made the 7 of us pretty tight. We used to hang out together frequently after work or on weekends. We became a close knit group of friends and I actually considered these guys my main group of friends. We are a group of 3 guys and 4 girls.

After my promotion, it caused a bit of a sour atmosphere with one of the other girls who was pushing for the same promotion. My previous post explains a little more about this, but she ended up getting fired due to being caught on camera stealing things from my locker (which she stayed behind after work to break into).

A little while prior to the firing, however, there was an incident at work where our department had been under productive. I was called up to the manager to talk about this and spoke to my team about why things were underproductive. I think because we were friends, when I got promoted, my team took liberties and took advantage I guess, thinking I wouldn't dob them in it. And to an extent I didn't. However, my team were deliberately slacking, taking extra breaks, not actually doing anything on their WFH days and admitting to me that they just log into the system and then do nothing. And it meant we were missing targets. Due to my promotion, it was me that had to explain to the manager why that was. Especially since she is no longer in the main lab with us now that I'm assisting manager.

I tried my very best to explain where the production issues were, without pointing blame and without giving specifics. But it was really hard to find excuses for a lot of the things going on that the manager was already aware of. I included myself in the blame and took additional responsibility for everyone else as it was my job to ensure that they were being productive but it wasn't good enough. After the manager spoke to everyone, everyone became convinced that I was in leagues with management and started seeing me as the opp.

As days went by I noticed I had been unfriended by these guys on social media. I was no longer being invited to social gatherings they were all having, our group chat we were all in fell abruptly silent when it was previously, continuously active (I heard a few days ago one of the girls asked if another girl saw what was in the group chat the night before so I presume they have made a new one without me in it). People were seemingly deliberately underperforming, and then being difficult when I tried to address it with them, despite me trying to be professional and impersonal. A few times I raised to these people that I once called my friends how not hitting performance targets would reflect badly on us all and they were like ""no, it will reflect badly on you, that's not our problem."" Only one was still cool with me because I was giving her lifts into work. But last month I moved out of her area so couldn't drive her in and now she has gone funny with me too.

Then the girl that was stealing things got fired and that riled up the others even more. I have seen the CCTV footage as have management, but they are all saying that they have spoken to her and she has denied it. Management have told me that my team are not allowed to view the CCTV footage, and when I told my team that I, personally, have seen the footage, they responded with ""yeah, so you say."" and ""allegedly seen the footage you mean."" So obviously they think I'm causing trouble. One of them was actually having a friendly chat with me earlier this week, and when she walked away, I heard one of the lads mumble to her ""careful, you don't want to get stabbed in the back."" I've literally been taking responsibility for these people's failures to perform and covering their asses in every meeting so that they don't get in as deep shit as they could do.

Meanwhile, I have management above me, badgering on about my team underperforming and how it's my responsibility to get them to work and that their shortcomings are reflective of me as an Assistant Manager. I'm staying behind after work a ton of days too, picking up the manager's slack, because I don't actually think she does anything upstairs except for drink coffee and chat with her mates who she shares an office with. Every time I go in there her monitor is locked due to idle activity and she is gossiping with the other managers, but is always ""too busy"" to help out when our lab is over capacity. All the training she chucks on me. The emails are all left to me. The queries are all left to me. Plus, I'm supposed to be manning the lab during peak times. I'm not actually sure what she does all day. She says she is drafting up new SOPs but I rarely see her release them.

I'm just so frustrated. I wish I had never recieved this promotion. It's made my life miserable in a job that I was actually pretty happy in about 3-4 months ago.",2,1742172466.0,work,0,1.0,False

There is a more fun and impactful way to proceed. Dress all nice, go to a Tesla dealership, check out the cars, ask for test drives, ask lots of questions, sip coffee, eat snacks, negotiate the price down, further down, rock bottom down, and pause. Almost buy and cut loose, walk away.

When I test drive a car I like to test the ability to emergency brake, do donuts, and drive over potholes to make sure it is a great ride. 

When I check out a car I make sure every single little piece of plastic holds well and does not come off when I pull and tug on it.

The boss, Rochelle, handed him a SUPERBLASTER15000, and pointed at the vats of boiling coffee in the hotel lobby.

Figured I‚Äôd check in since it‚Äôs been four months. Overall, things have been going pretty well. Work‚Äôs easier than ever, and I‚Äôm in the middle of building my own website. I finally got all the models I wanted and have been slowly painting up a full 3,000-point army. My TTRPG group is still going strong‚Äîwe manage to meet a couple of times a month, which feels like a miracle with everyone‚Äôs schedules. Money‚Äôs solid, and I‚Äôm even planning a trip to Thailand. Health has been up and down, but at least I‚Äôm losing weight with Ozempic, so there‚Äôs some progress.

But dating? Still a brick wall. I don‚Äôt think I look bad‚Äîprobably just average‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. Online dating starts off fine when I actually get a match, but I don‚Äôt like sending photos unless someone asks. When I do, the conversation usually dies. Most women just lose interest right after. People always say to meet people in person, which makes sense, but I never even get to that point.

That said, I have had some good experiences meeting people online, even if it didn‚Äôt turn into dating. I play regularly with a girl who has an awesome ArtStation portfolio, which has been great. But beyond that, dating has just been frustrating. It feels like I either have to check off some impossible list of requirements just to have a basic conversation or spend a ton of money just to set up a meeting. A lot of women don‚Äôt want to meet at all‚Äîthey‚Äôre just there to chat or promote their busenesses. And the ones who do meet up usually want an expensive restaurant, then either ghost me afterward or say maybe next time.

Before I messed up my ankle, I had a few in-person dates. One girl straight-up told me after that she only came for free coffee and didn‚Äôt find me attractive. That was just one case, but in general, most women seem to lose interest after the first date. One girl, who was nice about it, told me I probably shouldn‚Äôt focus on relationships right now and should work on my appearance instead.

I‚Äôve tried different hobbies to meet people, but nothing really stuck. Pottery didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Art was just people killing time. Horseback riding felt weird since most people there were families. D&D seemed promising, but even when I found someone into it, they didn‚Äôt stick around. Sports aren‚Äôt an option since my ankle is still messed up, and my back randomly decides to make things like putting on socks a struggle.

So yeah, life‚Äôs good in a lot of ways, but dating‚Äîand maybe the health stuff‚Äîkeeps dragging me down. No matter what I try, I keep hitting the same wall. The advice I get is always one extreme or the other. Either ‚Äújust stop caring and give up on dating‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not trying hard enough.‚Äù

The only thing that sort of made sense was someone telling me I either need to convince myself to stop wanting a relationship or completely change everything about myself. But that doesn‚Äôt feel like a healthy way to live.

1jczxjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1jczxjn/you_literally_make_coffee/,"""You literally make coffee.""","Found a post on Twitter from an account called ""Planet of Memes,"" where they caption a video of a Barista announcing their store is unionizing and striking, stating: ""You literally make coffee."" Since many people online and customers have this attitude, I'll break down everything that we do for those people who think our job is simply ""making coffee,"" and think that we aren't entitled to fair wages, working conditions, and a voice.

Sure, we make coffee. You know what else we do? We clean the store, we restock all the items, we manage drive-thru, we manage warming, we manage cold bar, we manage register and make hot coffee at the same time, we clean the piles of dishes that accumulate in the back, we make backups, we clean the millions of machines we have, and now are forced to write on every single bag and cup all while we have to take shit from management, and customers who complain when one single thing is wrong, and when we try to do the list of tasks we're given, we're interrupted with another task, and given shit for not doing something quick enough. We're given no voice in the company, all while the CEO is rakes in millions flying is private jet and getting bonuses for doing jackshit. We try to respectfully unionize but are given shit by thousands online who think all we do is ""make coffee."" We try to do our jobs, only to be given no support and find ourselves swimming in a sea of mobile orders who ask where their cake pops, frappuccinos and sandwiches are seconds after placing their order. I'm not trying to act entitled here or act like Starbucks isn't just simply fast food, but I'm also tired of the people who think the only thing they do is stand around and press buttons on an espresso machine for six-hour shifts and that's it. I understand this shit comes with basically any minimum wage fast food job, but at Starbucks, the entire perception of the company where it brands itself as luxury, therefore, us Baristas have to keep this image that we're more than just a fast food ""coffee shop"" that serves burnt coffee beans to customers who act entitled (and to be fair to them, respectfully so considering they're paying $6 for a low-quality cup of coffee).

I've been asked before by customers, ""why don't you just ask your manager for \_\_\_\_\_,"" and that really is how easy many people think it is to fix the problems we have with this company. People think that we can just quit our jobs and find a new one that checks the boxes we demand. No, it's not that simple. People have bills to pay, people have children to take care of, you can't just simply quit and hope to find a new job. Guess what? If we do, we'll be stuck trying to find a new shitty job that probably provides worse benefits, and has all the same issues Starbucks does, and that is if you can actually get a new job in this economy.

So for that one customer or person on the internet who thinks our job is just ""making coffee,"" there you go.",12,1742170756.0,starbucks,3,0.75,False

Written by¬†[Curtis Marquardt](https://utilitysecurity.com/blog/author/curtisutilitybusinessmedia-com/)¬†on¬†February 24, 2025. Posted in¬†[Industry Events](https://utilitysecurity.com/blog/category/industry-events/).

***The Security Industry‚Äôs Biggest Event is Bigger in 2025 and Has Expanded its Utility-Specific Education and Events***

Last year, I went to ISC West‚Äîthe nation‚Äôs leading converged security trade‚Äîfor the first time ever, and let‚Äôs just say I felt a tad unprepared by just how massive of a security event it is. To put it simply, there‚Äôs a big difference between reading that the event draws nearly 30,000¬†total industry professionals¬†and actually seeing with my own eyes swarms upon swarms of security professionals buzzing and navigating through the halls of the Venetian Expo.¬†

It‚Äôs a security spectacle unlike any other I have seen‚Äîand one that I found to be especially valuable to my efforts to grow my connections, learn about new security solutions and take in some insightful educational sessions presented by leading security minds.¬†

For those reading who might not know, ISC West is a leading comprehensive and converged security trade event that happens every year in Las Vegas. It draws security and public safety professionals from across the globe who come to learn from educational sessions, discover the latest safety solutions and make valuable networking connections.¬†

This year‚Äôs event is taking place from March 31 to April 4 at the Venetian Expo and has been expanded to feature an additional day of education as well as new spotlights on cybersecurity, drones, robotics and more. With these expansions, utility security professionals looking for industry-specific elements to the event will be happy to discover there are more than ever before.

I sat down with Mary Beth Shaughnessy, the ISC Events Vice President with RX, the event producer, and the Security Industry Association‚Äôs (SIA) Senior Director of Industry relations, Ron Hawkins, to talk all about the many ways that utility security professionals can get the most out of ISC West 2025.¬†

**Curtis Marquardt**  
**Thank you so much for joining me to talk ISC West! So, last year was my first ever ISC West and I was amazed at how massive and well attended that event is. It really is a Super Bowl of security. Can you tell our readers why ISC West 2025 is such an important industry event?**

**Mary Beth Shaughnessy**  
ISC West is the kickoff security event of the year! One of the biggest reasons that it is such an important event to security industry professionals is that we feature more than 700 exhibitors and, often, ISC West is the place where they launch and announce their new products and services. As our industry continues to evolve at such a fast pace, there is a lot of ‚Äúnew.‚Äù So, our event gives attendees a chance to be the first to see industry evolution.¬†¬†¬†

**Ron Hawkins**  
ISC West certainly has a lot for everybody, especially utility security professionals. We know that utilities are looking at drones and counter drone capabilities. Our expo floor has a drones and robotics section where they can learn all about those things. There are endless perimeter security solutions throughout the expo as well as a wealth of cybersecurity solutions. Convergence is a big issue, of course. And then that‚Äôs just the show floor.¬†

Our educational lineup has a wealth of expert presenters who will present topics that are specific to utilities and critical infrastructure. And the networking opportunities are fantastic. Beyond that, there are multiple networking events every day. It‚Äôs not hard for an attendee to find themselves double or triple booked at ISC West just because there is so much to do.

**Curtis Marquardt**  
**I‚Äôm glad you brought up the utility security-specific content. What are some of the educational offerings that utility security professionals will be excited about?**

**Ron Hawkins**  
In terms of the specific sessions that utility security professionals will enjoy, we have many! For example, Executive Assistant Director of the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Steven Harris will be doing a presentation. Brian Harrell, the CSO at Avangrid, will be presenting at least one session. Some of the session topics your readers will likely want to attend include: Countering Elevated Nation State Threats to US critical infrastructure, Game Changers: Robotics and Critical Infrastructure Security, and Safeguarding Critical Assets: a Guide for Security Professionals.

**Mary Beth Shaughnessy**  
I‚Äôm excited about the fact that we have extended our educational offerings from a three-day program to a four-day program and now have more ways to learn than ever before. This expanded lineup gives attendees more flexibility and time to both attend educational sessions and visit the expo floor. And, there‚Äôs much more to choose from. We‚Äôve increased our session count from about 120 sessions to 130!¬†

**Ron Hawkins**  
We have so much more education and we are excited about that. I also want to add that we are thrilled to be bringing back a key event for utility security professionals and that is our Protecting Utilities Luncheon. The last one was very popular and was standing room only! We already have one speaker confirmed and that will be Bluma Sussmen from NERC. We will be announcing another speaker for that soon.¬†

**Curtis Marquardt**  
**Utility Security magazine was both grateful and excited to be the media partner for Protecting Utilities luncheon last year and are very excited to have the opportunity to be the media partner for this year‚Äôs luncheon as well! So, let‚Äôs shift gears and talk about the expo hall. You already mentioned**¬†**some of the exciting things you have planned for the expo hall. Are there any other aspects or offerings happening there that attending utility security professionals should go see?**¬†

**Mary Beth Shaughnessy**  
Definitely! The Emerging Tech pavilion is always a very hot spot to visit while you‚Äôre at ISC West. So this year, we‚Äôre going to be featuring more than 70 emerging technology exhibitors. We will also have a smaller startup area on the show floor that will be embedded into the Emerging Tech area, which provides new innovators with the ability to showcase their solutions on the show floor. Also, we are bringing back a new area we launched last year which is called the AI Discovery Zone where attendees can see the latest in AI solutions.¬†¬†

**Ron Hawkins**  
I personally will be interested to see all of the new AI solutions that are out there. Obviously that‚Äôs having more and more of an influence in the security sector and every other sector for that matter.¬†

One other thing I‚Äôd like to mention is the SIA New Products & Solutions Awards ceremony. We have new products submitted and they are evaluated by 30 independent judges who determine which new security products and solutions are worthy of the award. This is a great way for attendees to really discover some of the very best security innovations.

**Curtis Marquardt**  
**So let‚Äôs talk about networking. Connecting with and learning from one‚Äôs peers I feel is really one of the most powerful ways to grow one‚Äôs knowledge. What sort of networking events at ISC West should our attending readers put in their calendars?**

**Mary Beth Shaughnessy**  
One I‚Äôm excited about is we are hosting our second ever music concert. Our first one last year featured a band called the Wallflowers and it was a big success. This year we will be featuring the Gin Blossoms. If you don‚Äôt remember their 90‚Äôs hits, I encourage you to go check them out on Spotify.¬†¬†

We also have our ISC Appreciation event. It takes place at TAO Nightclub on Thursday night and is a great place to network. And then right on our show floor, the Cyber Hub is a great spot where we‚Äôve got solutions that are being presented, but it‚Äôs also a spot that is always really packed with a lot of attendees and sponsors who gather to talk about the latest and greatest in cyber. One other great networking area on the show floor is the Bridge which has seating, educational sessions, award presentations and more. It‚Äôs a great space to meet up with a peer, grab a cup of coffee and see what‚Äôs going on.¬†¬†

**Ron Hawkins**  
Since Mary talked about the Bridge, I want to bring up a utility-specific event that your readers will be interested in. On Friday, April 4th at 11AM, SIA will have a NERC CIP discussion. Along with some members of our utilities advisory board, we will be talking about NERC CIP and SIA‚Äôs recently published Guide to NERC CIP Compliance.

On top of that, on Tuesday night, we have the Market Leaders Reception which is a really great event that happens at Dr. Dre‚Äôs Beach Club. That‚Äôs definitely a top-notch networking event featuring lots of great food and drinks. Of course, as I mentioned, a key event for utility security professionals is the Protecting Utilities Luncheon on Thursday, April 3rd at noon. We already have one speaker confirmed and that will be Bluma Sussmen from NERC. We will be announcing another speaker for that soon.¬†

**Curtis Marquardt**  
**There is definitely a lot to do! So, final question: just summarize why utility security professionals should attend ISC West.**¬†

**Mary Beth Shaughnessy**  
As this discussion has revealed, ISC West and SIA just offer so many things that focus on utilities and critical infrastructure from a robust educational component to the solutions you‚Äôll find on the expo floor‚Äînot to mention the many networking opportunities to take advantage of.¬†¬†

**Ron Hawkins**  
Recently, Trade Show Executive named ISC West as the Greatest Trade Show of 2023‚Äîan honor that inspires a lot of pride in all of the folks who put this event together. It was a really huge honor and that reveals just how highly regarded this event is. There is a lot of time and effort put into making sure the attendee experience is a great one!

Some of our guys valiantly tried to put their own aircraft up which last 20 seconds against the 3x Pantsirs. 

Match 2 - 12.0 Sweden, same shit as above.

Match 3 - Drop it down to 9.7 France. Uptiered as usual. Take the Mistral which is shit tier at best, SU25k's dominate with it's 19 billion flares and something as warm as a hot coffee in a nearby house is enough to distract the missile. Two of them, plus an Alpha jet, just constantly doing laps and pounding our spawn.

Checked the match time of all 3 games, every match was over in under 8 minutes.

My husband says I care too much for him. Let me give you some context and tell you his reasoning behind. 

My husband‚Äôs mother died abruptly at the age of 43 from a heart attack. She was not the healthiest person from the start. Drinking, smoking cigarettes and weed. Poor diet, no exercise etc.

My husband experienced anxiety after her death and projected that he also had heart issues. After ruling out a bunch of stuff he‚Äôs ok. This was 2019-2021.

2021 I had a baby. I obviously wanted my child to eat healthier. So I slowly started a healthy journey. 
However 2024 I decided to start living a healthier life. Remove most processed foods and watch out for saturated fats, hidden oils and eat more at home. I went to my doctor to get blood work done and encouraged my husband to. They did a stress test that came out good (because of family history) and bw that specifically said his triglycerides were elevated over the 150 mark I believe. 
I then decided to have a talk with him on the importance of reducing this number. He is a fit guy, tall, slim but lean. He walks all day and he isn‚Äôt a foodie. He does however enjoy salty foods over sweets and dairy products like cheese, butter, cream cheese, cream in his coffee etc. 

I personally educated myself in regards of saturated fats and the recommended amount per day and how it‚Äôs accumulative so you really need to be careful. 

Anyways, the issue is that my husband thinks eating Taco Bell one day. Then eating a bacon egg and cheese the next morning. Or a slice of pizza is ok. He cooks with butter. He adds butter into his oatmeal. He doesn‚Äôt think this is a lot and it isn‚Äôt but his triglycerides are still HIGH. Like his body is obviously saying it‚Äôs too much. Like considering how skinny and healthy he looks his body is genetically storing more of it or something. 

He tells me that I stress him out when we go out and I read labels or try to tell him to not eat something. Or ask him to choose something healthier. He says when I ask him to not cook with butter it stresses him out or when he does eat fast food I ask him to eat healthiest the rest of the day. 

Idk what to do or say to get it through him. 
I care about him because he‚Äôs my husband. The father of my child. I want him with me till we are old. I want him to not have complications down the line. I want the best for him. He thinks I‚Äôm smothering him. The doctor even told him to stop eating white carbs like rice and white bread. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care. 

He says ‚Äúmy triglycerides are for me to worry about not you‚Äù but we are a partnership alongside individuals. I‚Äôm not trying to harm him‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm trying to help him

Idk if anyone has advice. Maybe I am doing something wrong? I just don‚Äôt see how wanting someone to be healthier even if it means cutting off the unhealthy foods to be a bad thing.. ",1,1742170235.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è. Implied Animal abuse, and a graphic death 
You have been warned.




It's late at night, about 11:16. Notes were organized on the desk, photos and police reports, and a whole bored documenting the timeline of events. And a man was checking over the reports and documents, a decently tall dark skinned man, with a mustache and short hair. This man was none other than detective Sean kane, the FBI investigator hired to solve these murders.

Sean had sipped his cup of coffee, looking over all the notes. He didn't understand, this killer, dubbed ""the painter"" by police. Were somehow able to get past all of them, they had photos, a self portrait, a witness sketch, and even a goddam broken video tape. Sean rubbed his temples in frustration, this killer had claimed so many innocent lives in brutal ways, and they didn't have a clue on where they were! This killer should of been caught ages ago!

Sean had looked at the timeline of events, it all started when people started going missing, Jennifer, Lisa, Betty, Mark, and Heath. The police tried their best to search, but nothing was found. Sean looked at another case file, one he found hard to look at every time. ""Case file: the beck twins."" Cory becks case was when this whole investigation took off, Cory had reportedly seen a face in a cabin after being dared by his friends David and zeke to stay in it for an hour. Sean read the police report on how nothing was found in there, and he couldn't help but scowl at the pure incompetence. Because cory and Margaret beck were found dead in an abandoned paper mill factory a week later.

Sean continued to scowl, because the police checked the cabin again after cory and Margaret were found. The report noting that officer jake Lewis had tripped over a loose floorboard, which revealed Cory's camera, along with its photos. Sean couldn't believe it when he first read this, a child, with a bruised arm claimed to have seen a face in a cabin. And the police bearly searched it. And what happened due to their incompetence? Cory and Margaret are dead. Margaret from choking on a clay brick, and cory from unknown causes due to his bodys gruesome condition. The bruised arm should of been enough of a reason to tear down that FUCKING cabin! And now two children are DEAD because of it.

The reports of cory and Margaret didn't end there, as corys friends David and zeke came forward about what cory saw once Cory's body was discovered. Sean couldn't help but feel sorry for these kids, they didn't deserve this. Sean knows what its like to harbor guilt, he couldn't save his mother when he had the chance. And he prays that zeke and David are able to move on.

But the cases only pile up from there, next was a case file for "":Tina Rosenberg."" Sean had felt so much sympathy for Tina, she was the only known survivor from these killers. Tinas story was well known and almost famous. Sean had been able to interview and talk to Tina, she seemed so paranoid, so scared, and full of guilt. Their meeting was cut short because she broke down crying, wanting her sister and boyfriend back. Sean had made sure Tina was placed in a secure and protective witness protection, where he makes sure she's safe.

Than the case started to take off all over the world, Sean was massively upset by how the news media portrayed it. These were victims, real people who suffered horrible fates. But the news only viewed it as an easy way to make money. Sean had always hated the people running the news, they had no respect or good intentions for the victims of these tragedies, just anything to make a buck. And Sean had a bitter taste left in his mouth when he saw the types of questions Tina was asked in her interview, the questions were insensitive and offensive. To downright cruel.

Sean had pulled out an evidence book, full of crime scene pictures and paintings. Sean was disgusted by the paintings, how they mocked the victim their based on. The police found a bunch of them in a storage container, along with bodies such as Jackie Graham, Carla and James. This moment was when Sean came into the picture, as this wasn't an ordinary serial killer. This was a monster. Someone so incapable of any emotion towards another being. The police CLEARLY weren't able to handle someone like this, and so Sean and the FBI were brought in. Sean had vowed to bring this killer to justice, to find and put an end to their sins.

Sean had been a veteran detective for 20 years, he had seen a lot, brought many killers to justice, solved cases and looked for clues. He was the perfect detective for this case in many peoples eyes, he would surely help solve the case...right? But, this was different, the killer knew about every move they made, always 4 steps ahead of them. This aspect frustrated Sean greatly, how can one killer do this much?! He put his hands on his head, trying so hard to keep it together. He was meant to be solving this case, saving lives, but he's gotten nowhere. And so many more innocent people are dying because he can't catch this fucking killer!

Suddenly, Sean was snapped out of his frustration when he felt his dog Uzi rest his head on seans leg. Sean wasn't really the one to settle down with a wife, but, Sean was a massive animal lover, he had Uzi for about 6 years now. Sean had reached down to pet Uzi, letting out a small smile. He had reached and grabbed a chewie For Uzi, who happily took it and laid down on her bed. 

sean had looked at the rest of the documents, now calmer. He can't let his own emotions get to him, not now. But, these next reports had puzzled Sean. It was the Collins, who went missing and were all found dead in an abounded lighthouse, except angel. What puzzled Sean is that, all the found victims had an actual body, or some sort of remains. The collins were all found in a berral, what's weirder to Sean is that, only angel collins had a painting, the rest of them didn't. Only photos moments before their deaths. 

This aspect had puzzled Sean with theories. The killer had a known pattern, that pattern being there were always paintings for each victim. The Collins almost felt...personal to Sean, as if the killer had some sort of grudge against them, making sure the bodies were more unrecognizable than the rest. Seans mind raced with ideas or possibilities, as this was the only case that didn't fit with the others. Sean hadn't really met Bill or his family, but he had heard that they were lovely people. Sean only hopes their deaths were quick.

The next case was more recent, about a couple months ago. ""Case file: Ian Ford.""¬†¬†Sean was there during this case. He and his fellow colleagues were investigating the barn when the Fords were reported missing, they didn't waste any time getting there. Sean remembers the crime scene vividly, infact this was one of the first crime scenes he actually threw up on. The smell of the dead pigs was horrible, the corpses of mae, Fiona and Ian were found in the burn, along with an alerming amount of painting. And a broken vhs tape that the police is currently trying to recover.

Sean placed the file down, he didn't want to see the photos of the bodies again. He placed the file with the others. Finally deciding to settle for the night. Sean has started to sleep less, due to everything he's seen. A week before, he discovered Tom Harris's body. Inside a fucking giant candle of wax. These kills were almost getting ridiculous, as if the killer was just trying to one up every kill. Or see what they can get away with. Sean knows he needs to do something different, this strategy clearly isn't working, and Sean doesn't wanna put more lives at risk. The towns already getting more paranoid and agitated, some people even killed in accidental ways.

As Sean was brushing his teeth and getting ready, he heard something in the basement. And Sean was quick to realize, Someone was in the basement. Sean immediately stopped what he was doing and grabbed his gun. Sean was aware he was likely a target, but he didn't think the killer was stupid enough to attack him. Sean immediately grabbed Uzi and put her in the spare bedroom, locking her in. Sean immediately shot at the door, he heard a loud grunt from the other side, a raspy voice. The gun shot caused Uzi to start barking. Sean got closer to the door, making sure his gun was ready. Sean had a camera installed in that basement, hopefully it caught a photo.

Suddenly, the door was kicked open, Sean didn't even have time to react as he was suddenly tackled by a thin naked man with a face mask. The masked man had growled animalisticlly at Sean, proceeding to rip the gun out of seans hand and toss it. The masked man had begun to scratch at Sean, before biting down on his neck and ripping a piece off. Sean had cried out in agony, but he wasn't going down this easily. Sean proceeded to kick the masked man in the groin, before throwing him off of him. Sean quickly tried to grab his gun and call speed dial, he was given an emergency speed dial incase this happened.

But, Sean was grabbed by the neck and tossed into another room, it wasn't by the masked man. But, instead it was someone else. A women, pale, black wet hair. And a white gown. She was holding her shoulder, where Sean had shot her Sean quickly realized that, There were...two killers...the masked man quickly got up, and immediately attacked Sean again. Both men were sent tumbling down the stairs, where Sean had preceeded to break his leg during the fall, causing him to cry out in agony.

The women wasn't far behind, she had quickly grabbed Sean and threw him in the kitchen. Sean had tried to stand on one leg, grabbing a frying pan and hitting the women in the face with it, sending her to the ground. This action upseted the masked man, who barked at Sean and attacked him for the third time, clawing at seans face. Sean had managed to gouge at the masked man's left eye, which caused him to stop attacking Sean for a few seconds. This allowed Sean to punch the masked man, grabbing him and dragging him across the kitchen, breaking tons of plates and glass. 

Sean had thrown the masked man into a table, breaking it. Sean had grabbed one of the table shards and stabbed the mask man a few times. But Sean was pulled by the shirt and slammed into the counter, the women had grabbed a knife. And stabbed Sean 4 times in the back. She had flipped him over to stab at his face, but sean had used his own hand to block the knife, causing the knife to go right through his hand. Sean had used his good leg to kick at the women, but she quickly stomped on his ankle, breaking it. Sean still desperately tried to fend her off. But the masked man has got up, grabbing a thumb tak and jamming it into seans left eye, causing Sean massive amounts of pain. The women had the masked man grab another knife, and although Sean tried his hardest to fight, ripping the thumb tak out of his own eye and jamming it into the women's side. It was no use, the women had quickly slit his throat. 

Sean finally managed to push the women and masked man away, grabbing the knife and slashing the women's chest and shoulder...but the masked man had kicked him down. Sean was loosing a lot of blood, and fast. He knew he wasn't going to survive, but he was NOT going to let his death be in vein. The women and the masked man had grabbed a medical kit, while dragging Sean into the basement. Where he preceeded to write the number ""2"" with his own blood on the wall. Sean was thrown down the basement, the masked man not far off. But the women, had heard the barking from upstairs. And told the masked man to wait for her. She had used the masked man's real name, which Sean heard...the last thing he heard before loosing consciousness. ""Bill""",1,1742170088.0,UrbanSPOOK,0,1.0,False
1jczorx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/1jczorx/i_just_approached_an_older_woman_at_the_grocery/,I just approached an older woman at the grocery store,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share an experience I had today and hear from those who have more insight into dating older women.

I (M28) was at Albertsons, just stopping in to grab some milk, when I saw this stunning woman who looked to be in her mid-40s, maybe early 50s. She carried herself with such grace and confidence, and I couldn‚Äôt ignore how beautiful she was.

I decided to go for it. I walked up to her and said, ‚ÄúExcuse me, I just came in here to grab this,‚Äù (pointing to the milk in my hand), ‚Äúbut I saw you, and I thought you were very beautiful, and I wanted to come talk to you.‚Äù

She seemed pleasantly surprised and flattered, smiling as she thanked me. I asked her name, introduced myself, and made some small talk, asking if she was just shopping today. She said yes, just running errands.

Then, I went for it and asked for her number.

Her first response caught me off guard. She looked at me and instantly asked, ‚ÄúAre you a godly man?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt expecting that, but I answered honestly, saying, ‚ÄúYeah, I was raised Catholic. Are you a godly woman?‚Äù She responded, ‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù I then asked if she was Catholic or Christian, and she said Christian. I joked, ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre pretty similar,‚Äù and she laughed.

I asked again if I could get her number, and she said, ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She gave me her number, and I asked if she liked coffee and she said that she did. Finally I asked if she preferred calls or texts. She said text, and that was that.

I‚Äôm 100% interested in seeing where this goes, but I want to approach it the right way. For those of you who are older women or have experience dating older women, what‚Äôs the best way to proceed from here? Should I text her soon or wait a bit? Should I keep it casual at first or be more direct about my intentions?

I‚Äôd love any insight you all have!

Lying there in my Bed as the days first light began making its way through my bedroom window looking at me. Laying there looking out of the window to a another day laying there asking myself 

‚ÄúWhat has life got to give me today? ‚Äú

Thinking to myself seeing the sun as its light glimmered through and around the trees branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves. As if the sun was trying to tell me something as if it was trying to tell me that today was going to be different. 

But just as that thought left me the quietness of the morning was being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by my window making their way to a nearby school seeing and hearing that the early morning sounds was not going away anytime soon. Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.

 But slowly as I made my way up and out of bed making my to bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself. Looking a not so feeling to young Girl closing in on 30! Standing there running my hand back through my messed up blonde hair. Thinking to myself standing there looking into the mirror thinking to myself 

‚ÄúWhat could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day.‚Äù

 Another day of let‚Äôs see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on asking myself 

‚Äú Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here‚Äù 

Making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee. Setting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee. Setting there flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to myself 

‚Äú is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.‚Äù

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door. I noticed my coat was still hanging in the closet dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to myself 

‚ÄúMy head would still in the bed asleep it if we‚Äôre not attached to me‚Äù 

Doing a complete 180 making my way back into my room opening up my closet door reaching for it screaming 

‚ÄúOh my God! Now where in the hell is it!‚Äù

And that was when I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it. 

Walking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table not knowing of what I would find in it. Setting down to open it up to find Memories! Memories that would bring me to rediscovering the past in my life. A past that would bring me to finding something that was missing from my life. 

 I just didn‚Äôt realize it at the moment! It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom not always being very close to her it would still bring a tear.

But It didn‚Äôt seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.

 Who was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don‚Äôt realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this, 

‚Äú. To my lovely Daughter Dakota I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself‚Äù

‚ÄúThat no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 
Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.‚Äù

Reading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring back to me. But little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring me to that day.

Remembering back It was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running.  Jumping up onto my bed licking my face making himself known in his way telling me in his way. Only the way that my little buddy could do! Letting me know that another day was here another day
to go exploring. to find ourselves wondering out into a world of that only our imagination could.

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

‚Äú maybe later I‚Äôm not hungry right now‚Äù 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

‚ÄúHoney I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!‚Äù 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

‚Äú look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later‚Äù 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

‚Äú look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!‚Äù 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me a journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I would soon find. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 ‚Äúwhat else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.‚Äù

 Looking down at buddy saying to him 

‚Äú let‚Äôs go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here‚Äù 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 ‚Äú let‚Äôs go! Let‚Äôs see for ourselves what else is out there‚Äù 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line. I thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there! 

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

 Laying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. With him then Pulling out of the gas as I then looked to buddy saying

‚ÄúWoohoo we are on our way now!‚Äù

Feeling as the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. About fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we  passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn‚Äôt see us.  Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him 

‚Äú I know what you would say if you could talk but I know what I am doing ‚Äú 

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

‚Äúwhat was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?‚Äù 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting hearing the truck door open as a person then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy before making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. 

Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 Walking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk as people would pass us by. Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away on a piece of wood. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

‚ÄúWell hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you‚Äù 

Saying back to him 

‚ÄúThank you! His name is buddy! my mom got me from the pound‚Äù 

Smiling back to me he then asked me saying 

‚ÄúSo where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask‚Äù

Replying back to him I said to him 

‚ÄúJust seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way! On our adventure finding out what life has for us‚Äù

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

‚Äú finding yourself on an adventure! Why aren‚Äôt you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you‚Äù? 

‚ÄúMaybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then when are old enough you then can‚Äù

‚ÄúThen maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.‚Äù 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

‚Äú Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! ‚Äú

‚ÄúBut know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.‚Äú 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn‚Äôt know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

‚Äú You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life‚Äù.

 ‚ÄúFor everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life‚Äù 

As I then Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me 

‚Äú please Dakota come home wherever you are please come back to me‚Äù 

Waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead the journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way!  Spending most of the day keeping  in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment.

Thinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn‚Äôt maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as laid there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying 

‚ÄúWe are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.‚Äù

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off a world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

‚ÄúWait mom please come back please where are you going ‚Äú 

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

‚Äú I love you Dakota! I love you wherever your are‚Äù 

With that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself 

‚ÄúWhat have I done? What have I done to my mom?‚Äù

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Lying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me 

‚ÄúWhat in Gods name! I can‚Äôt even believe to what I am seeing!‚Äù

Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying

 ‚ÄúYou have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there‚Äù 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said to him

‚Äúyes very much so‚Äù

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me lying there in bed looking at him  saying 

‚ÄúHello‚Äú

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me 

‚ÄúWho are you‚Äù 

I replied to him saying 

‚Äú I am Dakota and what is your name‚Äù 

As he then spoke bake to me saying 

‚ÄúMy name is Billy‚Äù 

Walking closer o him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next to him. Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying 

‚ÄúThe Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better‚Äù 

Just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy. As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile 

‚Äú its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?‚Äù 

Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me 

‚ÄúA journey! 

‚ÄúMan I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed‚Äù 

Looking to Billy I said to him 

‚ÄúMaybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together‚Äù

Smiling to me saying 

‚ÄúMan that would be great going on a journey‚Äù

‚ÄúI would love nothing but to find myself on an adventure one day!‚Äù

With Billy just looking at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

‚Äú I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut hearing it in my mom and dad‚Äôs voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life‚Äù

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him 

‚Äú I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together‚Äù 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before we made my our way to front door. To where the authorities were waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever leave me again Dakota! Don‚Äôt you ever leave like that again me again‚Äù 

hugging my mom saying to her

 ‚ÄúI promise mom I will never leave you again‚Äù 

For as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking to myself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me. Looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me. As placed her arms around me with tears in her eyes 

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to my mom

‚ÄúWhy! Billy can‚Äôt die! He was going to get better so me him and buddy could go on a journey together‚Äù

Just knowing that setting there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me 

‚ÄúHoney I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.‚Äù 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom‚Äôs letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom‚Äôs grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him in this life and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me. 

For me to grow to appreciate the Life that I had, For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. There was a place!

1jczhj4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jczhj4,My Sonny üíî,"My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I can barely breathe. I can't see what I'm typing because my eyes are so filled with tears, my chest is so heavy, my soul is missing a piece, and it feels like I'm drowning. I knew the day was coming. I knew that someday I would have to say goodbye. I was not prepared for how my whole world has just stopped. 

Sonny passed away peacefully in my arms on Thursday 13th of March in the evening, at the age of twenty-one. The incredibly kind Dr. Reiner at Forever Loved Veterinary Hospice helped my baby across the rainbow bridge at home while cuddled and snuggled and adored until his very last breath. Sonny was the most incredible creature I've ever encountered and I am so fortunate and grateful to have earned the love and trust of such a pure and magnificent soul. I am honoured to be his mumma, having him in my life has changed me for the better since day one. He was my closest and best friend for half my life, and has rescued me in my darkest days, literally saving my life more times than I can remember. From the moment we met and he head booped his way into my heart, he was the absolute best part of those 7,326 days. I remember the curious, playful, rambunctious, loving, photogenic, charismatic, adventurous, brave, moody, silly, funny boy he was when he was one, all the way up to the pensive, stoic, dignified, yet still frisky little prankster, mighty king of the castle he grew to become at twenty one. He had us wrapped around his little paw and knew that he was the centre of our everything. 

The last week has been filled with reminiscing about our 20 years together... the day we met and I answered the door to see this gargantuan tuxedo chonk presented to me, and the head bonk to my nose that immediately gave him my whole heart... the day I first introduced him to my family's home, and he had to inspect every fallen and crunchy leaf outdoors and every dust bunny indoors for any signs of domestic terrorism... the time he very proudly presented me a bat he'd caught, dropping it onto my face while I slept, only to find out that it wasn't dead... the day we first moved to our current residence and he made a mad dash all the way down the hallway and straight into the apartment of building neighbours I had not yet introduced us to, and not-so-politely asked for cheese... and the car rides and adventures exploring every place we could think of to explore with him from Yarmouth to Guysborough. He saw The Cat ferry (impressed yet horrified that a Cat would purposely be in the water), Forchu lighthouse, the Acadian festival (and participated in the parade), Mavilette Beach, Fort Anne and Port Royal, numerous campgrounds and provincial parks, the apple orchards in the valley, blueberry fields in Digby County, the Apple Blossom Festival, the mudflats and dykes in Wolfville, The Lookoff, Nova Scotia waterfalls and rivers (obsessed with water striders), Halifax waterfront, the Public Gardens (even though I'm pretty sure ""No Pets"" included ones travelling by kitty backpack... whoopsies), numerous city parks, and travelled highways and back roads from one end of the province to the other (sorry Cape Breton, we never got to introduce ourselves to you). He saw bald eagles and ospreys, along with hundreds of other bird species (we were avid birdwatchers together), a family of moose (mooses? meese? meeses?) white tailed deer and foxes, skunks, porcupines, turtles, wild rabbits and his favourite arch rival - the red squirrel. The smack talk sessions he would get into! He had quite the potty mouth, but we know from where he got that. His obsession with birdwatching was to be expected, given he was a cat, but he had a special, uh, interest in the little yellow warblers or whatever yellow bird they are. Two weeks after having all but three of his teeth removed (two bottom fangs and one top one) at age 15, he caught one of those poor little buggers right out of the air while hanging out on the balcony. It managed to escape from Sonny's clutches (with my help), but that's when I really knew I was dealing with a supercat. He could spot a tiny chickadee from half a kilometre away. He could not be arsed with the ducks at the heart shaped pond, even if they were directly in front of him. He never met a bug he didn't find fascinating, and in the years before his retirement, was a mouse catching machine. He was interested in everything, he inspected, explored, investigated, and noticed it all. We couldn't be sneaky around him at all, his senses were too sharp, and right up until the end. Hell, a week before he passed, he was hurdling over the baby gate like he was training for a steeplechase. A 21 year old cat leaping over a 2 foot baby gate. More than once. Supercat. 

We spent his last day doing all his favourite things. We had morning snuggles after he yelled at us to get up and feed him breakfast. He stood guard against the garbage monster (garbage truck at the dumpsters) while we had our coffee. There will never be a better garbage monster slayer üíî I held him close to my breaking heart as we sang You Are My Sunshine to our sunshine one last time, and in true Sonny fashion, was annoyed with us for the extra cuddles and uncontrollable crying. There was a mid-morning bird watching session, squeezy tube licky treats, and we listened to Sonny's favourite singer, Elton John. I don't know if I'll be able to listen to Sir Elton without crying now (I guess that's why they call it the blues). For lunch, he has his absolute favourite meal, tuna sashimi, and we are forever grateful that he still had his appetite so we could watch him enjoy every bite. Thank you to Afishionados for providing Sonny with his favourite treat for so many years. In the afternoon, he rested on his spot on the couch and alternated between gentle pets and his favourite treats and more Sir Elton up until his time to go. His coat was shiny and soft up until his last day, and he was well known for knowing the importance of dressing your best, as his tuxedo was as perfect and as gentlemanly as the day it was new. He purred until his last breath, I felt the vibration in my ribcage, one final gift from my baby. He was relaxed and pain free and had no fear about what the next stage of his journey brought him. The sound of his purring was greater than any music ever written. It was the hardest goodbye. 

I'll love you forever. I'll like you for always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be. I will miss you, Sonny. You are the bestest boy. Always. ",11,1742169480.0,TuxedoCats,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm cold brewing 6 oz of espresso grind white coffee up to the 1 gallon mark and letting it sit for 2 to 3 days to ensure a strong base. I plan to add white chocolate flavor and introduce raspberries in secondary.

Since I‚Äôll lose some volume when adding the raspberries, I‚Äôm likely going for a 1.5 to 2 gallon primary batch. I‚Äôm also considering an experiment, using raspberry jam with pectic enzyme in primary alongside the coffee instead of adding frozen raspberries in secondary. Still working out the details.

For the honey, I‚Äôm using wildflower honey as I think its floral notes will complement the nutty, creamy, and fruity elements beautifully. To add white chocolate flavor, I‚Äôll use an extract to avoid introducing fats from cacao butter, which could go rancid.

I‚Äôm aiming for an OG of around 1.100, maybe slightly lower, since I don‚Äôt want this to be too heavy. I‚Äôll backsweeten with lactose and either more wildflower honey or a homemade liquid raspberry jam extract, still deciding. Before racking and bottling, I‚Äôll pasteurize.

I got a Garmin (first fitness tracking device) in February, and quickly discovered why I feel tired and burned out around 3-4 pm almost every day. I wear the Garmin [snug on my left wrist](https://imgur.com/OoBSOzx). I clean the sensor thoroughly when I take it off to shower and charge it. 

I feel like I practice good sleep hygiene, but I cannot figure out how to improve my [erratic sleep scores](https://imgur.com/yU3ViaA) (and as a result, [poor body battery scores](https://imgur.com/ujcwygM)). 

I sleep in a dark room with a box fan for white noise. Temperature is 65-67¬∞F. I have a consistent sleep schedule. I do not nap. No snoring or sleep apnea. No screens, I read a book for an hour before I fall asleep. My bedroom is clean and clutter-free. I fall asleep and wake up around the same time every day. Average sleep duration 7.5 hours. 

I don't smoke or drink. I have one 14 oz coffee in the morning. Vegetarian, no junk foods, very limited sugary foods. I drink water all day. Sleepy time decaf tea before bed. Mid 30s, female, 5'4"", 115 lbs.

I'm just scratching the surface of OpenCV and I'm hoping you folks can help me out with something I'm trying to do. I have an image of a circular coffee table taken at an angle so that in the image it appears as an ellipse. I've used contours and fitEllipse to find the ellipse.

https://preview.redd.it/r3sqtr3s25pe1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f1f52fcebf995b5a05c5cdb9498aef66f65f6f

There is a coaster in the exact middle of the coffee table, and as one would expect, in the resulting photo does not have the coaster in the middle of the ellipse, due to the perspective.

When I do a perspective warp based on the four axis endpoints to put it back to the circle, the ellipses midpoint becomes the midpoint of the resulting circle. Of course this makes sense. So my question is, how would I go about doing a perspective warp of the table so that the coaster is in the center of the resulting image? Is there additional data points I would need to result the correct perspective?",1,1742168963.0,opencv,0,1.0,False

Are you hearing this? Are you feeling the weight of what‚Äôs about to go down?
Because this? This isn‚Äôt just a rant.
This isn‚Äôt just another angry post.
This isn‚Äôt a moment.
This is a movement.
A line in the sand. A shockwave that will rattle the bones of every industry, every cushy executive office, every trust fund brunch table.
This is for the struggling.
The lost.
The broken.
The shattered.
The abused and the abusers.
The homeless.
The addicted.
The shamed, blamed, and written off.
This is for every single one of us that holds up their world while they pretend we don‚Äôt exist.
The ones with less than $1000 in their bank accounts on any regular day.
The ones paying overdraft fees just to afford groceries.
The ones who have to borrow just to breathe.
The ones who get laughed at for dreaming beyond survival.
And now, we stop.
Now, we step back and ask:
Who the fuck actually runs this world?
Who makes their coffee while they breeze past your post that you shared of theirs‚Äîwithout even a hi, bye, thanks, or kiss my ass?
Who does their dry cleaning?
Who delivers their custom makeup?
Who fixes their infinity pool when their drunk brother drives a side-by-side into it on a Wednesday afternoon?
Who stocks their groceries?
Who makes their food?
Who cleans their houses?
That‚Äôs right. WE DO.
The ones parking in the ‚Äúpoor people‚Äù parking lots.
The ones who like, subscribe, and share their content‚Äîcontent that bought their Porsche.
The ones who live paycheck to paycheck making sure their lives are effortless.
And for years, we‚Äôve swallowed it.
We‚Äôve showed up anyway.
We‚Äôve been grateful for our shitty jobs, our scraps, our barely-making-it lives because it was better than nothing.
But now?
Now, they‚Äôre not just getting richer.
Now, they profit off of our pain.
Now, they turn our trauma into their brand.
Now, they market suffering like it‚Äôs a trend.
Now, they pretend to care while cashing in.
They post about mental health while exploiting those who have none left.
They sell books about struggle without ever knowing what hunger feels like.
They brand themselves as inspirational off the backs of people who don‚Äôt have the luxury of quitting.
And you know what?
We‚Äôre done.
APRIL 1st. GLOBAL STRIKE.
(Jokes on the suits.)
No coffee runs.
No house cleaning.
No stocking shelves.
No restaurant shifts.
No driving deliveries.
No child care.
No holding up a system that never held us back.
Make your own damn coffee.
Pick up your own kid‚Äôs birthday gift.
Fix your own damn infinity pool.
Wash your own fucking toe jam, you greedy bastards.
Because let me remind you of something.
THINGS HAPPEN IN NUMBERS.
And hate to break it to you, but in this sweet, unfortunate, and oh-so-bound-to-happen case?
The ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù the ‚Äúunstable,‚Äù the ‚Äúunwealthy,‚Äù the ones deemed ‚Äúunable‚Äù‚Äî
WE SUCCEED IN NUMBERS.
And here‚Äôs the part that should really make them sweat‚Äî
We outnumber them.
Addicts.
Criminals.
The mentally ill.
The ones they call ‚Äútoo far gone.‚Äù
The ones struggling under their weight.
The ones they threw away.
The ones who keep this entire world functioning.
What happens when we stop playing the game?
What happens when we wake up and refuse to clock in?
What happens when we decide to let it all crumble?
They think their gated communities will save them?
They think their millions will cook their meals, clean their sheets, and carry their world?
Let‚Äôs see how long they last without us.
Because this time?
We‚Äôre not asking.
We‚Äôre not begging.
We‚Äôre not waiting.
We are walking.
We are stopping.
We are shutting it the fuck down.
And we strike until we are damn well good and ready.
And guess what?
We might just never come back.
WHAT ABOUT HUMANITY?!
A direct message to the world.
To those who have power and do nothing.
To those who suffer in silence.
To those who think they are safe from this conversation.
This is your reckoning.
If you currently have enough money in your bank account to comfortably pay your bills and survive for the next two months‚ÄîTHIS. IS. FOR. YOU.
And if you don‚Äôt? If you‚Äôre one of the struggling, the blamed, the discarded?
This is for you, too.
Because we are done being ignored.
LOUDER. LOUDER. LOUDER.
TO THE COMFORTABLE: DO YOU EVEN REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE?
You‚Äôre not losing sleep over how to afford food.
You‚Äôre not panicking over rent.
You‚Äôre not one unexpected bill away from total collapse.
And yet‚Äîyou sit there.
You scroll.
You watch people support you, share your work, uplift you‚Äî
And you don‚Äôt even have the decency to acknowledge them.
Tell me‚ÄîHOW do you justify that?
How do you see suffering happen in real-time and do nothing?
How do you walk past someone sleeping on the ground and go buy a $9 latte?
How do you see people begging for food and waste money on useless shit?
How do you watch entire families drown in medical debt while you spend more on a handbag than they have in their entire savings?
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THIS?
WE COULD FIX EVERYTHING IN 30 DAYS. BUT WE DON‚ÄôT.
Don‚Äôt tell me change is complicated.
Don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no solution.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a lie.
The world could be fixed in 30 days.
The only reason it isn‚Äôt is because those with power refuse to let it.
SO TO EVERYONE WITH A PLATFORM‚ÄîA VOICE‚ÄîA CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Are you ignoring this?
Are you reading this and feeling uncomfortable?
GOOD.
If you have the privilege of safety and stability, then you have the responsibility to use it for others.
And if you don‚Äôt? Then YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.
If you are struggling, YOU ARE THE REVOLUTION.
WE ARE THE REVOLUTION.
They want you to stay silent.
They want you to stay small.
MAKE THEM REGRET THAT.
LOUDER. LOUDER. LOUDER.
Because once this fire spreads, they won‚Äôt be able to put it out.

I can imagine how he would feel reading the message and it‚Äôs making me feel like I overreacted to hurt him. 

This is my ex husband. We were watching a tv show together on discord and I left for a minute to get a cup of coffee but I was still on the call and told him what I was doing. I was still in the room, just not sitting at my desk. When I came back with my cup I heard vague moaning sounds and I said ‚Äúwhat are you watching?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúnothing‚Äù and I just assumed he had turned on the tv and it was just something in a movie. I jokingly said ‚Äúturn off your porn so we can finish the episode‚Äù though I didn‚Äôt really mean it. 

Well, he calls me about an hour or so after the episode is over to apologize because he felt embarrassed. I asked him for what because I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. Turns out he was in fact watching porn while on the call with me. I didn‚Äôt really know what to say so I just said ‚Äúhaha wow that is crazy. That‚Äôs really crazy. Why would you even do that? That‚Äôs.. that‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù And then he hung up to hang out with his friends. 

I felt really disgusted and disrespected by this, I was so grossed out I had to take a shower. I ended up texting him this afterwards. We are really close friends and he knows I have a boyfriend now and even if I didn‚Äôt, he knows I‚Äôve always been really disgusted by porn in general so I really just can‚Äôt imagine why he would think it was ok to watch this in my presence? He says he didn‚Äôt mean for me to hear it he thought it was muted, but I don‚Äôt see why he would do it at all. 

My boyfriend says I‚Äôm too forgiving with people and I always think everything is my fault. But I feel like maybe I‚Äôm overreacting and I‚Äôm further embarrassing and hurting him when he already said he was sorry. Like, that I‚Äôm just hurting him because I was mad.

A bit about me‚ÄîI‚Äôm single, Hispanic, no kids, just a cat and some fish. Fitness is a big part of my life, and I‚Äôd love to meet someone who shares that passion. I enjoy cooking, traveling, reading books and manga, and gaming on PC and Switch. Nature is my escape‚ÄîI love hiking, camping, and exploring natural landmarks.

I speak four languages (two natively, two I‚Äôve learned or am learning). Gardening is another passion of mine, and I dream of one day being self-sufficient with a homestead. I can go on and on, so feel free to ask me anything when we chat!

A few things about my lifestyle‚ÄîI don‚Äôt smoke or use stimulants (besides coffee). I‚Äôm not into clubbing or drinking unless it‚Äôs in a private setting, and even then, it‚Äôs rare. I‚Äôm direct and honest, a bit reserved with strangers but completely open with my partner. Affection is very important to me‚Äîphysical closeness and touch are essential.
What I‚Äôm Looking For

    Consistency, honesty, and communication‚Äîthese are key.
    Someone who wants kids and holds traditional values when it comes to dating and roles. (You can work if you want, but not because you have to.)
    I‚Äôd love a partner who enjoys cooking together and someone who is capable and self-sufficient.
    I‚Äôm old-fashioned in romance‚ÄîI open doors, show affection openly, and have a bit of a possessive, protective streak when it comes to my partner.
    I prefer someone needy, who craves attention, affection, and praise. I give my all to my partner and family, so I want someone who thrives on closeness and daily intimacy‚Äîsharing meals, sleeping together every night, and being each other‚Äôs safe space.

Physical & Lifestyle Preferences

    I‚Äôm generally drawn to Asian or Hispanic partners but am open to other backgrounds if we click.
    More than anything, I value compatibility and a partner who complements my life.
    I‚Äôm willing to travel or relocate to be with the right person‚Äîeven the idea of being a nomadic couple sounds exciting!

I know how hard it is sometimes to believe that there is hope to get out of that deep dark hole, but I promise you there is. If you have tried quitting and failed, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. Failure is part of the long and winding road to recovery. It‚Äôs part of the process. Make sure you drink plenty of water and coffee (If you don‚Äôt mind caffeine. Natural diuretics will help the stuff get out of your system faster). And take a vitamin C supplement which supports the liver detox pathways. Also some vitamin B to keep your energy levels up while you slog through the scaries. I know it will be the last thing in the world you feel like doing, but get up and take a walk, or even better, get your pulse up with some vigorous exercise to help your hypothalamus get back to homeostasis. That‚Äôs the reason you have the cold sweats and the shakes. The withdrawal is jacking with your temperature regulation center, and exercise can help it get back to where it needs to be. The worst will be over in four to five days. 

But that‚Äôs just the physical part. For those of you who have struggled to stay on the path in the following 30 days when the depression rolls in, just remember that that will also pass in time. Fill your time with good things and good people. Have your favorite food, watch your favorite movie, call your best friend. Tell them what you are going through. Tell your family what you are going through. Make it so you can‚Äôt go back without everyone knowing. Do what you have to do. It‚Äôs worth it. And this, I think, is the most important point: When you do get out, look inward. Figure out why you needed to change your state of mind instantaneously in the first place. There‚Äôs always an answer. Even with caffeine, there‚Äôs a reason you have to have a cup of coffee every day, and maybe that reason in more simple in nature than the reason you started Feel Free. It‚Äôs natural to experience moods and feel down sometimes. Just remember that it‚Äôs ok to feel bored and annoyed and upset and lethargic, and that‚Äôs part of life. 

Anyway. There are people of love you and who care about you. They don‚Äôt want to see you throw all your money away. And they don‚Äôt want to see your health deteriorate. And they definitely don‚Äôt want to see you miserable. And I am one of those people.

*‚ÄúMom! Mom!*¬†***Look!***¬†*It‚Äôs happening again,‚Äù*¬†Emi squealed, captivated by the viscous maple syrup slowly floating to the top of the upright bottle on the kitchen table, stubbornly defying gravity.

My heart raced. Anxiety danced hectic circles around the base of my skull. My palms became damp.

God, I didn‚Äôt want to look.

\- - - - -

As crazy as it may sound, the sight of that bottle physically repulsed me.

Maybe I correctly sensed something terrible was on the horizon: recognized the phenomena as the harbinger of death that it truly was. That said,¬†*the shift*¬†took place a long time ago: half a century, give or take.

Retrospection has a funny way of painting over the original truth of a memory. In other words, when enough time has passed, you may find yourself recalling events with thoughts and feelings from the present inseparably baked into the memory. Picking that apart is messy business: what‚Äôs original versus what‚Äôs been layered on after the fact, if you can even tell the difference anymore. So, trust me when I say that I find it difficult to remember that morning objectively, in isolation, and removed from everything that came after. I mean, it's possible that I¬†*didn‚Äôt*¬†feel what was coming beforehand: I could have just woken up pissed off that morning. That would certainly be enough to explain my strong reaction to Emi‚Äôs harmless excitement in my memory.

What I‚Äôm getting at is this: I don‚Äôt know that I can guarantee this story is one-hundred percent accurate. Not only that, but I‚Äôm the only one left to tell it, meaning my story is all¬†*anyone*¬†has. For better or worse, it‚Äôs about to become sanctified history.

If I‚Äôm being honest, I don‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm misremembering much. I can still almost feel the way the air in the neighborhood felt heavy and electric in the days leading up to that otherwise unremarkable spring morning. I just¬†*knew*¬†something was desperately wrong: sensed it on the breeze like a looming thunderstorm.

Like I said, though.

I‚Äôm the only person left to tell this story.

The story they paid all of us survivors a great deal of money to keep buried.

\- - - - -

*‚ÄúEmi - for the love of God, put the damn thing back in the fridge and get your books together.‚Äù*¬†I shouted, my tone laced with far more vitriol than I intended.

We were already running late, and this wasn‚Äôt the agreed upon division of labor. She was supposed to be packing her bag while I put her lunch together. That was the deal. Instead, my daughter had been irritatingly derailed by our own little eighth wonder of the world.

*The magic syrup bottle.*

It was unclear¬†*which*¬†part was magical, though. Was the syrup supernaturally rising to the top of the container of its own accord, or had the magic bottle¬†*enchanted*¬†the syrup, thus causing sugary globules to float like the molten wax of a lava lamp?

*Maybe the Guinness Book of World Records has a wizard on retainer that can get to the bottom of that question when they stop by to evaluate the miracle*, I thought.

Sarcasm aside, my aggravation was actually a smokescreen. It was a loud, flashy emotion meant to obscure what I was actually feeling deep inside: fear. For an entire week, the syrup had been swimming against gravity, drifting above the air in the half-filled bottle against the laws of physics.

I couldn‚Äôt explain it, and that frightened me.

But! Everything else was normal. The atmosphere was breathable. The landscape appeared unchanged: grass grew, trees bloomed, birds flew. Our stomachs still churned acid and our hearts continued to pump blood. The gears of reality kept on turning like they always had, excluding that one miniscule anomaly: an insignificant bending of the rules, but nothing more.

*So then, why was I so damn terrified?*

Emi scowled, swiped the bottle off the table, and returned it to the top shelf in the fridge with an angry¬†*clunk*. With my demand obliged, she made a point of glaring at me over the door: a familiar combination of narrowed eyes, scrunched freckles, and tensed shoulders. An expression that screamed:¬†*are you happy now, asshole?*

After a few seconds of unblinking silence, she slammed the fridge closed with enough force to cause a rush of air to inflate her burgundy¬†*Earth, Wind, and Fire*¬†T-shirt: a fitting climax to the whole melodramatic affair.

The commotion brought Ben into the kitchen, tufts of curly brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses cautiously peeking in from the hallway. Then he made the mistake of trying to defuse the situation before it was ready to simmer down.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the bewitched syrup will still be here when you get home from school, honey. Unless your mother has a hankering for mid-day flapjacks, but the woman I married is definitely more of an eggs and bacon type of gal.‚Äù*¬†My husband said with a warm chuckle. Neither Emi nor I acknowledged the attempt at levity.

Ben was insistent on cooling down arguments with humor. Sometimes, I resented him for that. It made me feel like he saw himself as¬†*The Friendly Guy*, perpetually forcing me to accept the role of disciplinarian by default. If he never took anything seriously, what choice did I have?

I shot my husband an annoyed glance as Emi stomped past him. He sighed, rubbing his neck and putting his eyes to the floor, crestfallen.

*‚ÄúSorry, Hakura. Was just tryin‚Äô to help,‚Äù*¬†he murmured.

As he trudged out of the room, I said nothing. Not a word. Just watched him go, white-hot fire still burning behind my eyes.

In my youth, I struggled with anger. I tried to control it, but the emotion overwhelmed my better instincts more often than not. I‚Äôm much older now, and since then, I‚Äôve developed a tighter grasp on my natural temper. I think Ben would agree, at least I hope he would.

He wasn‚Äôt around long enough to see me try harder.

Out of everything that was to come, out of all the horror that was to follow, I wish I could change that moment the most. In the decades that have passed, I‚Äôve had thousands of dreams rewriting that snapshot in time. Instead of giving in to the anger, I swallow it and remind Ben I love him: A smile and a hug. Or a comment about how handsome he is. A kiss on the cheek. Or a peck on the lips. A lighthearted chuckle to match his own:¬†*something*¬†kinder than vexed silence. Thousands of those revisions have lingered transiently in my mind‚Äôs unconscious eye, and when they do, I feel peace.

Until I wake up, at which point those revisions are painfully sucked back into the blissful ether of sleep, and I‚Äôm forced to confront reality.

That shitty moment was the last meaningful interaction I had with the love of my life.

Minutes later, he‚Äôd be falling into the sky.

\- - - - -

All things considered, the start of that morning was decidedly run-of-the-mill: The blue, cloudless view overhead. A gentle spring breeze twirling over trees in the throes of reawakening, cherry blossoms and magnolias budding triumphantly along their branches like fanfare to welcome the season. Our neighbors lining the streets and chitchatting while awaiting the arrival of the school bus to see their kids off for the day, cups of hot coffee in hand.

Everything as it should be and according to routine, with two notable exceptions.

The atmosphere looked distorted, like a grainy TV image just barely coming through a finicky antenna. It was subtle, but it was there. I swear I could almost feel the gritty static dragging against my skin as I followed Emi and Ben out the front door.

And, for some reason, Ulysses was outside. Between having no children and being an unapologetic recluse, our next-door neighbor‚Äôs attendance at this before-school ritual was out of character. On top of that, the sixty-something year old appeared distinctly unwell: bright red in the face, sweat dripping down his neck, eyes darting around their sockets like a pair of marble pinballs as he scanned the street from his front stoop.

Per usual, Emi bolted across the street as soon as she saw Regina, her childhood best friend, standing among the growing crowd of kids and parents.

Emi and Regina were inseparable: two kids lovingly conjoined at the hip since the day they met. Recollecting the good times they had together never fails to conjure a beautiful warmth at the center of my chest. At the same time, that warmth is inevitably followed by a creeping sense of unease: a devil lurking in the details.

That devil was looming behind Regina, smiling at my daughter as she approached.

*‚ÄúBen - Ulysses looks sick. I‚Äôm going to go see how he‚Äôs doing. Can you keep an eye on her? Barrett‚Äôs out today.‚Äù*

He nodded and jogged after our daughter, needing no further explanation.

\- - - - -

Six months prior to that morning, Regina‚Äôs father, known locally as¬†*‚ÄúPastor B‚Äù*¬†on account of his position in the local Born-Again parish, had slapped Emi across the face for creating too much noise while running up the stairs in his home. In the wake of that, we forbade Emi from spending time at Regina‚Äôs.

The girls really struggled with that decree since it drastically cut down on the time they could be together (Regina was not allowed to spend time at our house because it was¬†*‚Äúmuch too loose and unabashedly sinful‚Äù*). Seeing Emi so depressed was absolutely killing us. Thankfully, Ben came up with the brilliant idea of walkie-talkies. The clunky blocks of black plastic he purchased at a nearby hardware store had quickly become the pair‚Äôs primary mode of socializing when they weren‚Äôt outside or at school together.

We pleaded for the sheriff to charge Barrett with assault. His response was something to the tune of¬†*‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm confident there‚Äôs been a misunderstanding‚Äù*. When we asked¬†*how*¬†there could possibly be a¬†*misunderstanding*¬†regarding a grown man slapping our daughter, he replied,

*‚ÄúWell, because Pastor B*¬†***said***¬†*there was a misunderstanding. That‚Äôs all the proof I need.‚Äù*

Religious figures, especially where we lived, held a lot of sway in the community. Got away with¬†*way*¬†more than they should‚Äôve. Even more so in the seventies.

Ben and I were beyond livid with the sheriff‚Äôs inaction. That said, there didn‚Äôt seem like much else we could do about the incident except support our daughter through it. The first night, she cried her heart out. By the next morning, though, she wasn‚Äôt very interested in talking about it, despite our gentle attempts to coax her into a longer conversation about the trauma.

Initially, we were worried she was holding too much in, but we developed another, certainly more unorthodox, means of catharsis and healing. Brainstorming demeaning nicknames for Barrett with Emi proved to be a surprisingly effective coping strategy. Brought some much needed comedy to the situation.

Ben came up with¬†*Pastor Bald*¬†on account his sleek, hairless scalp. Personally, I was more fond of my, admittedly less sterile, contribution.

*Reverend Dipshit*.

\- - - - -

Confident that Emi was being watched after, I paced across our yard to Ulysses. He was standing still as a statue at his open front door, one foot inside, one foot on his stoop. As I approached, he barely seemed to register my presence. Although his eyes had been darting around the block only a minute prior, they weren‚Äôt anymore. Now, his gaze was squarely fixed on the developing crowd of teenagers and parents at the bus stop.

In an attempt to get his attention, I gave Ulysses a wave and a friendly:¬†*‚ÄúGood morning, long time no see‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I guess he saw the wave in his peripheral vision, but the man skipped right over pleasantries in response. Instead, he asked me a question that immediately set off a veritable factory full of alarm bells in my head.

*‚ÄúI-I thought the school bus came at 8. No, I was*¬†***sure***¬†*it came at 8. W-Why is everyone out now? It just turned 7:25.‚Äù*¬†he said, the words trembling like a small dog neck-deep in snow. Sweat continued to pour down his face, practically drenching the collar of his pure white button-down.

*‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶school board changed it to 7:30 a few weeks ago. Ulysses, are you al-‚Äù*

Before I could finish my sentence, a deep, animalistic scream arising from the down the street interrupted me. Reflexively, I swung my body around, trying to identify the source.

There was a man on the asphalt, gripping his head while writhing from side to side in a display of unbridled agony. From my vantage point, I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly¬†*who*¬†it was emitting the noise, but I watched a few of the parents detach from the larger group, sprinting to the wailing man‚Äôs aid.

For a moment, I found myself completely immobilized, stunned by the harrowing melody of his pain. Couldn‚Äôt move an inch. Being subjected to that degree of raw, undiluted torment had seemingly unplugged each and every one of my nerves from their sockets.

An unexpected¬†*crash*¬†from behind me quickly rebooted my nervous system, dumping gallons of adrenaline into veins in the process. I spun back around, nearly tripping over myself on account of the liquid energy coursing through me, which was overstimulating my muscles to the point of incoordination.

Ulysses had slammed his door shut. He shouted something to me, but I can‚Äôt recall what he said. Either I couldn‚Äôt hear it or I wasn‚Äôt capable of internalizing it amongst the chaos: it just didn‚Äôt stick in my memory.

Under the guidance of some newly activated primal autopilot, I didn‚Äôt attempt to clarify the message. Instead, my legs transported me towards the distress. I needed to make sure Emi was safe. Nothing more, nothing less.

God, I wish I remember what he said.

\- - - - -

Thirty seconds later, I placed a hand on Emi‚Äôs shoulder, startling her to high heaven and back. She yelped, gripped by a body-wide spasm that started from her head and radiated down.

*‚ÄúHey! Just me kiddo.‚Äù*¬†I said, trying to sound reassuring as opposed to panic-stricken.

A silky black pony tail flipped over her shoulder as she turned around. Without hesitation, she sank into arms, hot tears falling down my collarbone as she quietly wept.

*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs‚Ä¶There‚Äôs something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom.‚Äù*

I‚Äôm a little ashamed to admit it, but I don‚Äôt remember much about Mr. Baker. All I can recall is that he was a mild-mannered Vietnam veteran that lived a few houses down from us, opposite to Ulysses. I think he suffered from a serious injury abroad: may have retained a fragment of a bullet somewhere in his head, requiring him to use a cane while walking around. I‚Äôm not completely sure of any of that, though.

Don‚Äôt remember his first name, don‚Äôt recall if he had a family or not, but I remember those words that Emi said to me: clear as day.

I imagine the phrase¬†*‚Äúthere‚Äôs something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom‚Äù*¬†sticks out in my brain as a byproduct of the trauma that immediately followed.

There‚Äôs a terrible piece of wiring in our species that causes traumatic events to be remembered as vividly as humanly possible. Once imprinted, they seem to become a meticulous blow-by-blow recreation of the incident we‚Äôd kill to forget, every detail painstakingly etched into our psyche: some impossibly elaborate mosaic painted on the inside of our skulls, all-encompassing and inescapable, like the¬†*‚ÄúCreation of Adam‚Äù*¬†on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

Emi said¬†*‚Äúthere‚Äôs something wrong with Mr. Baker, Mom‚Äù*¬†and I saw Ben a few yards away from us, kneeling over Mr. Baker, altruistic to a fault.

Then, the crackling explosion of a gunshot rang through the air.

The street erupted into chaos. People fled in all directions. I grabbed Emi tightly by the wrist. She was paralyzed: had to make her to start moving towards the house. Practically everyone was screaming in horrible solidarity with Mr. Baker. Someone elbowed me hard in the diaphragm, knocking the wind out of my lungs. Eventually, our feet landed on the sidewalk in front of our home. Then, a second gunshot. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from, nor did I see anyone injured.

A few steps away from the door, I noticed something else. The air felt increasingly palpable: thick and granular, like I was wading through an invisible sandstorm.

Once Emi was inside, I immediately turned around to search for Ben.

When I spotted him, my heartbeat became erratic. It floundered and thrashed inside my chest like the dying movements of a beached shark. Between the elbow to my diaphragm and the sheer terror of it all, I could feel myself gasping and panting, anchoring my hand to the door frame to prevent myself from keeling over.

He was halfway across the street, pulling Mr. Baker towards our house. To this day, I‚Äôm not sure if he was aware of the sedan barreling down the road, going entirely too fast to break in time.

I met my husband‚Äôs eyes. Waves of disbelief pulsed down my spine, sharp and electric. I don‚Äôt recall him looking scared: no, Ben was focused. He got like that when something important was on the line.

Before I could even call out, the runaway car was only a few feet from crushing the both of them: then, a tainted miracle.

An experience that lies somewhere between divine intervention and a cruel practical joke.

The front of the car spontaneously tilted upwards, like it was starting to drive up the big first incline of an unseen wooden roller coaster. Somehow, it barely cleared both Ben and Mr. Baker in the nick of time. It hovered over them, cloaking their bodies in its eerie shadow. Then, it just kept going, farther and farther into the atmosphere, without any signs that it would eventually return to the earth.

Before I was able to feel even an ounce of relief, it all started to happen.

The shift.

In order to understand, I need you to imagine you‚Äôre currently living on the inside of a snow globe. Not only that, but you‚Äôve actually unknowingly lived in a snow globe your entire life: one that‚Äôs been sitting on the top shelf of some antique shop, completely untouched by human hands for decades.

Now, to be clear, I‚Äôm not suggesting that I was trapped in a massive snow globe half a century ago. I just cannot come up with a better way to explain this next part.

As the car disappeared into the horizon, it‚Äôs like someone finally reached up to the top shelf and picked up that dusty snow globe, only to promptly flip it over and hold it upside down. Slowly, but surely, everything that wasn‚Äôt directly attached to the ground began to fall into the sky.

Other cars. Family pets and other animals. Cherry blossom petals.

People. Neighbors. Children. Adults.

Mr. Baker.

Ben.

Almost me, too. Luckily, I was far enough in the house where, when I fell, my lower body remained inside. Hit my back pretty hard against the floor. I heard Emi screaming behind me, along with the crashing of our furniture colliding into the ceiling. Our grand piano was heavy enough to make a hole through the roof, causing the sky below to leak into our home as it fell.

Dazed, my vision spinning, I lifted my head just in time to witness the love of my life careen into an ocean of blue, cloudless sky. It was painfully quiet at that point. Those that fell were far enough away that I couldn‚Äôt hear their pleads for mercy or their death rattles, if they were still alive at all.

Ben got smaller, and smaller, and smaller: A smudge, to a dot, to nothing at all. Gone in an instant, swallowed by something I couldn‚Äôt possibly hope to comprehend.

At precisely 7:30 AM that morning, the world shifted.

The snow globe flipped, so to speak.

\- - - - -

I apologize, but I need to pause for now. Putting these memories into words for the first time has been more emotionally challenging than I anticipated.

Once I rest, I‚Äôll be back to finish this. I‚Äôm posting it incomplete on the off chance I don‚Äôt make it till the morning. Better to have something out there as opposed to nothing at all.

My follow-up should be soon. I imagine after I post this, someone who was involved in the shift will be notified that I‚Äôm breaking the terms of our agreement: the silence that they paid very good money for fifty years ago.

So, I‚Äôll be sure to complete this before they have time to find me.

1jcyspl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Common_Efficiency428/comments/1jcyspl/just_bought_a_kf7/,Just bought a KF7,"So after gathering lots of information on different models, I finally made up my mind and bought the KF7 a week ago. I'm really happy with my choice, even tough it isn't perfect. So I thought I'd give you an overview of my pro's and con's, hoping that could be helpful for some people like me who are looking for as many information as possible before making their choice.
I had a Nespresso (original) and was looking for a superautomatic which could make lattes, capuccinos and americanos. I wanted it to be as easy as possible to use and clean and didn't wan't to waste a lot of money on cleaning products. I also wanted to make sure I could make decaf if needed (so pre ground coffee option).
I bought it on sale for 1800$ CAD+ got 60$ of free beans.

What I like about the Kf7:
-I can make lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos .. and even make it double (2 cups at the same time or one large)
-it's SO easy to clean. I even think it requires less time then my Nespresso. I prepare 2 milk drinks every day (1 or 2 hours apart) and I rinse it after each drink.It really doesn't take much time. Just plug it and press the button (touchscreen). I always make sure there's an empty cup for the rinsed water. Than about once a week it needs a few minutes to clean (empty and clean the tray, clean the milk system with some mild soap).
-I expect that once in a while it's going to ask for a deep cleaning of the milk system- KitchenAid suggests mild soap so no expense here, compared to Jura who recommends that a specific cleaning product be used everyday if you prepare milk drinks.
-KitchenAid isn't trying to sell you specific cleaning products. In fact, it seems like they don't even sell any descaling product. I just brought some from Miele. But I bought KA filters and cleaning pucks (the machine is to warn me after about 200 coffees).
-I'm pretty sure it's less noisy than the Nespresso was.
-I LOVE that there is a removable bean hopper. I already bough a second one, in which I put decaf beans, so no need for pre-ground decaf. And I also can easy altern between 2 different beans. There is even a purge bean function so you can make sure there is nothing left from the previous beans.
-the brew group is accessible so you don't need to pay for the maintenance.
-there are small wheels at the back so you can move it easily fowards and backwards.

What I don't like that much:
-even if I choose the highest temperature, lattes don't come out very hot. Asking that the milk comes out before the coffee (yes, you have this option!) helps a bit. 
-there's no way my travel mugs can fit. That said, I use large travel mugs and I found no superautomatic on which it could fit.
-It's quite bulky- and not the cutest machine if you ask me. But the material looks solid and good quality. I chose the black one and don't regret it at all. I think the stainless probably looks better, but I don't have much counter space and have to put it next to my stove so didn't want it to get too dirty.
-I like that it comes with a milk container. But the lid doesn't hold securely so you really need to be careful. I would have liked an airtight container. It doesn't seem like we can leave milk in this one for more than 2 or 3 days.

I'm new to superautomatics so can't tell much about the coffee. But I just bought a selection of different beans from a local shop and I'm eager to discover which will be my favorites!

1jcyslo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1jcyslo/water_clues_jonestown_plans_s2e9/,Water Clues & Jonestown Plans (S2E9),"In After Hours, our cold open ends with an undeniably foreboding reveal of the water tower. Specifically, we see Helena looking pointedly at something out of the passenger side of the car, and in the next shot we see the passenger side of the car passing what is revealed to be the water tower. 

I predict the momentous day of Cold Harbor's completion will involve a ""mass suicide"" (mass murder) event in which everyone deemed disposable at Lumon is killed by water. Obviously, this was hinted at by the drowning question given to Gemma in s2e7. Perhaps the water supply is poisoned. Perhaps the perpetual snow finally melts and drowns them all. Perhaps they will all be drowned in the Chekhov's pool that was just introduced. Regardless, **water and mass death seem part of the plan.** 

\- Another theory is all of the above, except not just the workers/innies. Everyone in the building will be killed, with the intention of reincarnating the Egans. 

Here are all the clues about water in this episode alone: 

Water allusion #1: Helena swimming

Water allusion #2: Jame grimaces after drinking and wipes something off his coffee mug in a close-up. Has he taken something to protect himself? Is he being poisoned along with everyone else?

Water allusion #3: Helena looks at the water tower and we get our final shot resting on it.

Water allusion #4: We open post-credits with the smashing of the water game.  Miss Huang is being spared the mass drowning fate? 

Water allusion #5: Dylan, upset by the conversation with his wife, tosses all of his smoothie ingredients in the sink. She has stopped him from drinking the proverbial kool-aid (yes, it's also typical of an annoying spouse to leave waste in the sink, on brand for outie Dylan). By setting off the events that led to Dylan's innie quitting, has his wife unknowingly saved him from the mass poisoning/drowning he would have endured if he'd remained in Lumon?

Other clues: Fire is the opposite of water. At the top of the episode, Jame Egan has a fireplace going. And the episode ends with Cobel standing in front of the roaring fireplace -- she is the antidote to the planned death by water. Also note that in season one Devon was standing in front of that same fireplace when she realized that the rich folks have special cabins. 

Another mass death by water clue: We see a repeating theme of characters escaping by land. Huang is taken away by bus, Irving is taken away by train, Mark is smuggled to rescue by truck. Dylan . . . seemingly escapes, but we don't know if it happened. 

Finally, the very last reveal is Jame Egan accusing ""his"" Helly of tricking him, and innie Helly is all ""wtf?"" which, as a cliffhanger, feels like a red herring. 

We are supposed to this she is confused because she's Helly and has never seen this guy in person. But I'm guessing she is confused because she's really Helena again, who came racing back to Lumon after being unable to find Mark Scout . . . and maybe she is confused because she thought she had successfully poisoned her dad that morning? Does Jame think he is talking to Helly and has he been brainwashing a sub-innie version her on the testing floor? But she managed to fake it and escape her fate?

OK, I need to touch grass, but those are my thoughts!! What do you think?

While it's ideal to look beyond physical appearance, the reality is that many people, including some voters, make judgments based on how others present themselves.

In the context of politics, it's surprising that some opposition parties seem to overlook the importance of professional attire. For instance, certain party uniforms, such as bright neon vests  (SDA) or orange shirts with khaki pants (NSP), may give the impression of being security guards or delivery personnel, respectively.

1jcysem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1jcysem/coffee_maker_with_grinder_recommendations/,Coffee Maker with Grinder Recommendations,"Based on the sources, there isn't a strong consensus on the ""best"" Grind and Brew coffee maker. In fact, the prevailing opinion in the provided Reddit discussions is to avoid all-in-one Grind and Brew machines altogether and instead opt for a separate grinder and coffee maker.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments and mentions:

Arguments Against Grind and Brew Machines:

‚Ä¢ Compromised Quality: Many users believe that the grinder in a Grind and Brew machine is generally of poor quality, often compared to the cheapest whirly-blade grinders.

‚Ä¢ Steam Issues: Steam from the brewing process can negatively impact the performance and lifespan of the integrated grinder.

‚Ä¢ Subpar Brewing: The drip brewer component is often no better than the cheapest automatic drip machines.

‚Ä¢ Single Point of Failure: If one part (grinder or brewer) breaks down, the entire unit becomes unusable and needs to be sent for warranty or repair, even if only one component is faulty.

‚Ä¢ Difficult to Upgrade: If you want to upgrade either the grinder or the brewer, you have to replace the entire machine.

‚Ä¢ Cleaning Complexity: All-in-one machines tend to have more parts to disassemble and clean.

‚Ä¢ Cost Inefficiency: For the same amount of money, you can usually buy a far superior separate grinder and brewer setup. One user pointed out that a decent entry-level grinder can cost more than some Grind and Brew machines, indicating a potential compromise in quality.

Mentions of Specific Grind and Brew Models (with mixed opinions):

‚Ä¢ Breville YouBrew: This model is mentioned positively by a few users. One user at their office finds the grind perfect, the machine easy to use, and the taste consistent and good due to Breville's steep method and fresh burr grind. Another user finds all-in-one Breville products easy to use and of decent quality, suggesting the newer YouBrew model as a top choice in this category, especially for convenience. However, it's also acknowledged that better coffee can be obtained with cheaper separate gear.

‚Ä¢ Breville Grind Control: One user shared their experience with this machine over eight years. While it works well when functioning, it is described as high maintenance and prone to jamming if not cleaned frequently, particularly with oily beans. This user would not recommend it despite its decent lifespan.

‚Ä¢ Delonghi Single Brewer with Grinder: This model from Canadian Tire is mentioned by the initial poster in the Edmonton thread but has bad reviews, mainly concerning mess and leaking issues.

Recommendations for Separate Grinders and Brewers (considered the ""best"" option by many)

Grinders:

‚ó¶ Baratza Encore: Frequently recommended as the best value and a workhorse with easily sourced and installed parts, potentially lasting over 5 years. A slightly nicer version, the Baratza Virtuoso, is also mentioned as lasting for 8 years with daily use.

‚ó¶ Capresso Infinity: Suggested as a possible alternative if the Baratza Encore is out of budget.

Brewers:

‚ó¶ Pour-over cones (like Hario V60): Suggested for the highest quality coffee and minimal work, especially when paired with a good grinder.

‚ó¶ French Press (like Espro): Also recommended as a simple and effective brewing method. However, one user explicitly stated they didn't want a French press due to ""muddy coffee"".

‚ó¶ Moccamaster: Considered the ""THE best drip coffee maker"" but is expensive, though sometimes available on sale.

‚ó¶ Aeropress: Mentioned as easy to use and clean as another alternative to automatic drip.

Key Takeaway:

The majority of opinions in the sources suggest that the best option for coffee quality and long-term value is to invest in a separate burr grinder (like the Baratza Encore) and a standalone coffee maker that suits your preferences (such as a pour-over device, French press, or a recommended automatic drip machine). While Grind and Brew machines offer convenience, they are generally seen as compromising on coffee quality and potentially leading to more issues in the long run",1,1742167469.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False
1jcyrxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jcyrxn/pseudo_or_placebo_hunger_on_carbs_vs_actual_and/,"Pseudo or placebo ""hunger"" on carbs vs. actual and real hunger in ketosis/fasted state","There is no ""personal Keto experiment on own body"" tag but that's what I did. This will sound trivial for many, but it hit me like a ton of bricks this weekend: even something like a rumbling stomach does *not* have to mean that I am actually physically *hungry*, ie. am experiencing the absense of food in my stomach. It can *still* be my brain crashing from carbs and reacting to low blood sugar, even when it literally feels like I am starving and have not eaten for days. Actually, the greater the urgency feels, the more certain I can be: this is not real, actual hunger. 

We went hiking on an altitude and I left my house early Saturday morning, with a small portion sized keto breakfast. Coffee, fat, protein. 

I didn't eat all day except like 3 nuts and my electrolytes and water. It worked well considering that I had pulled through 6hrs of consistent and strenuous hiking on narrow and steep up and down slopes. Eventually there was a persistent *slight* hunger which built up slowwwly over the afternoon, but I was too busy not falling off drops or twisting my ankle on the more challenging sections, which were almost constant, to really pay much attention to it. At some point it even felt pleasant. Light, and not like a full belly that I had to log around. Electrolytes and water kept me pretty happy. 

At night I was hungry though, and since dinner was genuine Austrian cuisine I opted for their pork neck in sauce (YUMM) - and because I wanted to test something very specific, I opted to order it with this kind of dumpling they do over there that is the size of a fist and basically pure potato starch plus bread crust. The most delicious 200 or so grams of carbs I can personally think of. It's dense, rich, delicious and SO filling. PLUS I had a pint of amazing German beer. Carb binge deluxe, I was so, so satiated and full. 

You best believe that at 10pm my brain told me: ""Get a snack"". 

I closed my eyes and tried to really feel the sensation proactively. My stomach was still FULL. Not about to burst as before perhaps, but I could literally feel the damn food still being there. 
By 11pm, that desire became big. My stomach had actually started to RUMBLE. When before dinner, it hadn't. Although the fasted state there was MUCH bigger. Despite absolutely having stuffed myself just hours prior, being absolutely satiated and full... my body wanted more. Just a lil snack, but defo carb-y. A dessert. Cheesecake seemed perfect. It gave me all the right signs that this was actual hunger. Stomach rumbling. Pangs. Feeling slightly lightheaded, even. Everything everyone always says is a surefire sign of being *hungry*. The only counter indicative I had was rational. I had just eaten, and a whole lot, and there is absolutely no way that this meal had been fully evaporized and passed through my digestive system. I honestly can not believe that our body tricks us like this. The power of carbs is unreal. The extent to which they mimic processes in the body is astonishing, to say the least. All from a mere up then down of glucose in our blood streams. When it 100% *feels* like: ""I have a hole in my stomach and I need to fill it, NOW.""

When I'm on Keto, even though my last meal is often 12+ hours behind me, I wake up with this mildest form of hunger. Exactly the way I felt before dinner on Saturday afternoon. It's there but I can push it aside, and even do super light cardio on it. Without a problem. 

Sunday morning, I woke up with a) a much greated desire for caffeine. I felt sluggish overall. Probs not the best sleep either because my digestive system was busy all night breaking down the food, when it was supposed to do a calm night shift of resting and perhaps a bit of cleaning up. And b) I woke up with that stinging hunger pangs sensation yet again. Which I had thought for the longest time meant that I need food. When it's literally pseudo hunger. It's a dupe. Not actual hunger. Probably trivial for you Keto veterans; pretty wild discovery for me. I had never made the time to really test and try and actively examine it. But now I know for sure the difference. Next time I break Keto (which will happen I'm quite sure), I can seriously keep calm and carry on. The ""omg I'm starving"" will be a ""eh. stfu, drink electrolytes and maybe breathe. You'll be alright"". It's a relief but a shock at the same time. I have a history of eating disorder and also Hashimotos which comes with insulin resistance per se, plus leptin sensitivity. This would play a role I'm assuming but either way; Keto has been such a blessing. I'm not yet losing tens of thousands of pounds (I have about 15 that I want gone), but I have booted my oedema and water retention, which is amazing all by itself. Plus my pms which was gruelling almost all my life calmed down significantly. My hair, skin and nails have improved dramatically. My gut microbiome has improved dramatically (THANK YOU PSYLLIUM HUSK, what a great and neat little colon cleanser this miracle powder is). Sleep has improved. Really just about everything. I overall *feel* SO much better. Thank you to this sub, it's so helpful. Especially the electrolytes info was so so so crucial for finally being able to switch to Keto for good.

6 oz frozen fruit, 1 serving stevia (measurement varies by brand), warm water\*

\* I just guess on the amount of water. More water usually means less flavor and more ice, but if you're into volume eating, adding more water will help stretch this recipe to the fill line. 

* Blend & freeze for at least 24 hours 
* Run under hot water just long enough to loosen the lid (like 10 seconds) 
* Spin on Sorbet 
* Re-spin once with a little coffee creamer (I use Nutpods Unsweetened French Vanilla) 
* Mix-In with some more coffee creamer 
* Enjoy! 

This has worked well with mango, blueberries, strawberries, cherries, and pineapple! I have 8 pints on hand, so I make batches of these at a time with different fruits. I used to do two re-spins and no mix-in, but I found that 1 re-spin and 1 mix-in gives it the best texture. 

Tip: Shell out a hole in the middle of the pint with the back of a spoon before adding the creamer, to make sure it gets evenly distributed. ",1,1742167253.0,ninjacreami,2,1.0,False

I watched this KDrama on GMA 7 (a Filipino national channel) in Fil Dub and they titled it as ""The Girlfriend"" or something like that, but that's not the original title.

The plot goes like this:

A group of girls ( i forgot how many there are) form a KPOP girl group, and their symbol is a four leaf clover that they found on the sidewalk. It was even on their album cover. Time passes and they become successful. However, after a few months after their success, drama formed between the girls and also their entertainment agency. The main character has a boyfriend in secret, and apparently it's prohibited. Another girl gets pregnant and one of the other girls gives her coffee, because she got jealous of the girl I think, I forgot. But yeah, the coffee results in her losing the baby, and the group disbands.

This show is from around 2005-2010 I'm sure, and I already looked at the KDrama series list that GMA has on Wikipedia, but somehow I still cant find it.

Does any of you recall a show like this? ",1,1742167156.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

1jcymxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jcymxg/cant_believe_im_a_healthy_weight_now/,Can't believe I'm a healthy weight now,"I, 20F, have finally reached a healthy weight (and a healthy waist line by that). I'm just happy and I don't really know who to share this with. The other morning, I have reached 158 lbs (71,6kg), which almost 70 lbs (31,7kg) down, from my highest point, which was almost 230 lbs (104 kg) and I still want to reach 143 lbs (65kg) by july. 

In February of last year I was at around 210 lbs (95 kg) , but to be honest, I didn't loose all that weight on purpose, though I did want to do it. I was in school at the moment and had gotten down to 195 lbs (88,4 kg) in June of last year, with a guessed calorie deficit and long walks. 

I have started loosing more in July, when I started working in a warehouse and to be honest appart from that, there wasn't much food calculated, I just didn't really eat in the morning (protein shake and coffee), because I can't handle food at that time. I guess I have been doing intuitive eating and also toning it down on alcohol had also helped. 

And that brings us to the present and to be honest there are some things I'd like to share. First of all, my mental health and insecurities did improve,  but didn't go away. I'll often have body dismorphia,  since I keep seeing the body I used to have, until I see old pictures of myself and realize how much I have changed. I still need to accept myself and realize that I am more than mt body. 

On the positive side, I have noticed physical changed, I can see the veins in my hands and arms (which honestly disgust me, I don't like veins), I can move around more easily without being tired (especially stairs) and have more energy throughout the day.

Right now I am focusing on my long term habits, like eating more fiber and protein , as well as knowing how to limit myself and I'm trying to find an exercise that I like. I just need to work on myself mentally and hopefully, by summer I will finally wear a bikini proudly. 

I just want to finish this by saying that weight loss  doesn't necessarily makes your insecurities go away, but it does get better and accepting yourself as you are makes the process so much easier. Good luck everyone! ",33,1742167055.0,loseit,4,0.95,False

We saw several feet away a sign that said ‚Äústay on the path‚Äù. So we got on that path an followed it. It led us to an old cemetery with unmarked graves. We sat there for a while to say hello and send love to the passed on souls. Then we followed a road around back to the front of the hotel. The very friendly lady at the front desk told us the graves are the patients when the Inn used to be a Lunatic Asylum. She told us we should go up to the top of the building so we did and it was lovely. We sat under a weeping willow tree for a while (at least I think thats what its called). Then on the walk home we passed by a shop that said ‚Äúhat bar‚Äù and I told my husband that we should go in because our mouse might be in there. The lady at shop greeted us and told us that the business is nonprofit and everything goes to helping survivors of human trafficking. There were giant angel wings on the wall, which was just another nod we were in the right place! I looked around the whole store and did not see a mouse. I went up to the lady and asked her if there was anything with a mouse and just as I asked I looked over to some finger puppets and said ‚Äúoh maybe right here.‚Äù And she said ‚ÄúI think we used to have one but I don‚Äôt think we do still.‚Äù She started looking through the puppets and bingo! One cute little mouse holding a heart. So I bought it and snapped a little photo with the hat bar sign.

1jcylaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jcylaj/hr_sirens_cove/,[HR] Siren's Cove,"A few days on the coast was just what the doctor ordered. And that‚Äôs literal; Josh‚Äôs therapist told him that he was working himself half to death, that maybe a vacation would help him get his mojo back.



And there was nothing stopping him. He had plenty of vacation days saved up, and his ex-wife had custody of their twin girls for all but one week a month. Which for Josh, was a blessing; he always wanted a son, and was profoundly disappointed that his wife refused to keep trying after the girls were born. It was one of many reasons their marriage didn‚Äôt work out.



He was eager to spend five days at the beach, forgetting about his stressful job and the daughters he didn‚Äôt see eye-to-eye with, so he browsed online a really good off-season deal on a VRBO condominium. It was the middle of November, meaning most of the locals would be away from the beach, wrapped up in hoodies and sweatpants if the weather ever dipped below 70 degrees. But he grew up in Massachusetts, so even on a November day, these waters off the coast of South Carolina felt as fine as a bath tub.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After going inside and setting his clothes in the condo‚Äôs dresser, he dove through the folder of brochures on the coffee table. He was just looking through the takeout recommendations for that night, but one of the brochures he found caught his eye for a completely different reason.



‚ÄúSiren‚Äôs Cove Historical Tours.‚Äù the brochure‚Äôs title read. He got curious and opened in.



‚Äú*Legend has it that there used to be a siren haunting this island, one who‚Äôd sing from the beach and lure lonely, unmarried sailors, fishermen, and dock hands into the sea with her songs, only to take them below the water and devour them.¬† Our walking tours will take you to all the‚Ä¶‚Äù*

	



And that‚Äôs where he stopped reading. It was a funny local legend, but one he thought was clearly just made up as a tourist trap. And the last thing he wanted to do on his vacation was spend time hearing outlandish ghost stories.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

	

Even though it was well past dark, it was a warm night (by his Massachusetts-born standards), so he put on his crocs and decided to go for a little walk on the beach.

	

As he stared into the pitch black water and the starry night sky, he heard something amazing. It was a woman singing, and not just any singer, this was the best singing he‚Äôd ever heard. There weren‚Äôt any lyrics to her songs, but in a way, that made it better; it made it more enchanting.



He looked around, hoping to see where it was coming from, but he couldn‚Äôt find it. He kept getting closer and closer to the water, but still, he couldn‚Äôt tell where his heavenly music was coming from.



‚ÄúSir.‚Äù A male voice said. Josh turned around, and saw a man on the beach, with a flashlight in his hand. When Josh¬† got closer, he could see his vest said ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù on it.

	

‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm with the city‚Äôs parks & beaches department. I‚Äôm sorry, but the beach is closed after sunset. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to vacate.‚Äù

	

‚ÄúUm, thank you. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù He said.

	

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. Happens all the time. Just please go back.‚Äù The security guard said.



‚ÄúBy the way, did you hear that?‚Äù Josh asked.

	

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù The security guard asked.

	

‚ÄúThe singing?‚Äù

	

‚ÄúSinging? No.‚Äù The guard said.



Josh then asked ‚ÄúAny chance you‚Äôre married?‚Äù

	

The security guard then showed his wedding ring. ‚ÄúHappily married thirty-four years. Why?‚Äù



Josh ignored the follow up question and continued walking back to his condo.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Josh ordered a sandwich from one of the places recommended in the folder of brochures, ate it on the condo‚Äôs back porch, and went to bed. But as he went to sleep, he couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about that intoxicating song. How could any human voice be so perfect? And where was it coming from?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next day, he tried to move on from what happened. He figured it was probably just a dream. After all, could a voice that perfect be real?¬†

So, in the morning, he laid on the beach and read a James Patteron detective novel he bought from the thrift store. Around noon, he went out for lunch in one of the beachside restaurants. And by the mid afternoon, it was time to take his shirt off, and get in the water.

	

The beach wasn‚Äôt too crowded, just a few families with children too small to be in school. He set up a chair on the beach, left his shirt and his cellphone there, and approached the water. As he did, he began to hear the singing again.

	

This time, he knew it wasn‚Äôt just a dream. He could hear it, clear as day. There was a couple near him, building sand castles with their kids.

	

‚ÄúExcuse me. Sorry to bother, but do you know where that‚Äôs coming from?‚Äù Josh asked.

	

Both the husband and wife looked confused. ‚ÄúWhere what‚Äôs coming from?‚Äù The husband asked.

	

‚ÄúThe singing.‚Äù Joshua said.

	

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear any singing.‚Äù The wife said. ‚ÄúSure that‚Äôs just not the wind, it‚Äôs a bit of a breezy day.‚Äù

	

This wasn‚Äôt no wind, he was sure of it. So, he got in the water, and didn‚Äôt stop. As he went further and further, the singing got clearer and clearer.

	

And then, he saw the singer; a BEAUTIFUL woman, with a perfect face and golden blond hair. ‚ÄúCome on, come swim with me.‚Äù She said.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

	

Next thing he knew, he was back on the shore, with a paramedic standing over his chest.



‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre awake, thank goodness. Are you alright?‚Äù The paramedic asked.



‚ÄúUm, yeah, I feel okay. What happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou gave us quite a scare, is what happened. You were drowning. Thankfully, the beach lifeguard saw you and dashed out there to pull you onto shore. You should be okay, but be more careful.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you. Don‚Äôt worry, won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù Josh said.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

He was exhausted, physically and mentally, after what happened, so he just chose to spend the evening indoors. The condo had a comfortable couch, and a TV that got all the sports channels, so he decided this would be a perfect place to watch football. Sure it wasn‚Äôt what he originally planned, but hey, at least it‚Äôd be relaxing.



While he was watching Auburn vs Georgia Tech, he heard a knock on the back window. He looked up, and saw the flawless face of the woman from earlier.¬†



He rushed out to see her, but by the time he got out the backdoor, all he saw were footprints, leading straight to the water.



And then, the singing started. The beautiful, intoxicating, mesmerizing singing was coming from the beach.



He ran towards it. The same security guard from the day before

yelled ‚ÄúSIR, THE BEACH IS CLOSED‚Äù, but Josh ignored him, ran straight through the beach and into the water.



‚ÄúI‚ÄôM HERE!‚Äù He yelled, as he was waist deep in water. But he heard the singing move further out, so he waded further out, until he was too deep to walk and began swimming.



‚ÄúSIR, PLEASE COME BACK.‚Äù the security guard shouted one last time from the shore, but it fell on deaf ears.



The woman, the beautiful, beautiful woman,¬† poked her head out of the water. Despite having just been under the surface, her radiant blond hair still looked straight out of a magazine.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù Josh said, before she grabbed him by the wrists, and pulled him under.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Josh was never seen or heard from again. His remains were never found.

As a precaution, I charged the truck to 80% Friday afternoon.

I hooked the truck into the generator inlet located in my garage using the 30amp/240V L14‚Äì30 connection located in the bed. 

I have two 200 amp panels in my house. I was only able to power one of course, but for the garage refrigerator and freezer that we‚Äôre not on that panel, I was able to plug them directly into the plug in the front trunk. 

We are on a well and also have a whole house Reverse Osmosis water filtration system complete with UV filter, and repressurizarion pump (our water out of the ground is basically salt water). 

This truck was able to power half my house (with selective power management, of course) including well pump and water maker, repressurization pump, gas heater, septic system pumps, 3x refrigerators, 1 deep freeze, home network, various lights, TV, bottle washer and sterilizer, coffee maker, toaster, and more. All without breaking a sweat. 

It barely used 20% of the battery over the course of 42 hours and we weren‚Äôt holding back. I wanted to push that little 30-amp plug to the limit and never once tripped it. 

I am somewhat bummed they didn‚Äôt put a 50 amp outlet with 10.2 kW power output capability, but even so this setup is fantastic and exceeded expectations. 

I would love for GM to display current load (in watts or amps) the inverter is putting out, but not the end of the world. I‚Äôm coming from a Rivian and their software is certainly more refined. The range and drive experience of this truck far outweighs the software limitations.

W/ Gunpowder Gin: white cranberry, drop of lemon juice, and tonic > was very refreshing!

W/corrigans: was mostly a standalone with a cookie foam topping and whipped cream. The corrigan‚Äôs tastes very good and leaves a milky aftertaste. (If you‚Äôre a dairy fan like I am). Dusted with nutmeg and cocoa powder.

W/Bailey‚Äôs: kept it simple with a vanilla coffee, cookie foam topping and dusting with cocoa. > ended up shooting this down because of the nice sweet and creamy taste. Can leave you craving a chocolate cake.

W/McConnell‚Äôs: seagram‚Äôs Ginger ale (6 oz to 3 oz liquor ratio), nutmeg pinch, and lemon juice (3 oz). This one was a favorite as the whiskey was very light and mixed well with the ginger ale. The nutmeg helped give a nice light spice kick in the aftertaste. The whiskey itself was also very smooth.


Some stuff I have left over:
Corrigan‚Äôs
Irish Gin

Jonah‚Äôs curse spiced rum

Recently, I wrote an article on this series:

[Code Smell 292 - Missing Return](https://www.reddit.com/r/cleancode/comments/1iz3aze/code_smell_292_missing_return/)

One of my readers, Marcel Mravec pointed out this ""feature"": 

> New in Swift 5.1: The return keyword can now be omitted when declaring functions and computed properties that only contain a single expression, which is really nice when declaring simpler convenience APIs:

[Omitting the return keyword](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/tips/omitting-the-return-keyword/)

This kind of ""language feature"" creates more friction when transitioning from accidental languages. In this era you need to be ready to transition between [accidental languages](https://maximilianocontieri.com/no-silver-bullet) quickly.

Some languages allows you to omit the return keyword in single-expression functions and closures. 

While this can make your code concise, overusing it can lead to confusion, especially in complex or nested logic. 

When you rely too much on fancy tricks like implicit returns or [ridiculous castings](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-69-big-bang-javascript-ridiculous-castings), you risk making your code harder to understand and debug.

```swift
func calculatePrice(items: [Double], taxRate: Double) -> Double {
    items.reduce(0) { $0 + $1 } * (1 + taxRate / 100)
    // If you are not familiar to swift 
    // you cannot understand what is returning
}
```

## Right üëâ

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/c0385349b8c777e7f8ea4e4c2f1a646e)

```swift

    let subtotal = items.reduce(0) { sum, item in

# Why the Bijection Is Important üó∫Ô∏è

When you learn to program in pseudocode, you acknowledge functions return values. 

Writing less code is not always better. 

Sometimes you break the [Bijection](https://maximilianocontieri.com/the-one-and-only-software-design-principle) between your knowledge and the code you write.

When you abuse implicit returns, you break the [MAPPER](https://maximilianocontieri.com/what-is-wrong-with-software) by hiding the logical flow of your program.

It's harder for others (and your future self) to understand the intent behind the code.

# AI Generation ü§ñ

AI generators often favor concise code, which can lead to overuse of implicit returns. 

While this makes the code shorter, it may sacrifice readability and maintainability.

# AI Detection ü•É

AI tools can identify and refactor implicit returns into explicit ones with simple instructions. 

You should always review the changes to ensure they improve clarity without introducing unnecessary verbosity. You are the pilot!

# Conclusion üèÅ

Abusing implicit returns might save a few keystrokes but costs you readability and maintainability. 

You should be explicit when your logic gets complex or spans multiple lines.

Sadly, many languages encourage this code smell.

Some of them allow it on single expressions like:

- Swift
- Kotlin
- Scala

Some of them allow it on lambdas:

- Javascript
- Python

And many other allow your tu omit the return anytime:

- Ruby
- CoffeeScript
- Haskell
- Elixir
- F#
- Erlang
- Clojure

You will notice this a feature present on most [functional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).

We were everything, and yet nothing at all. We shared so many important moments in our lives: firsts, celebrations, and heartbreaks. We met so innocently as teenagers, and our virtual relationship was as passionate as it was short-lived. When I finally came to visit you, it was like a supernova. So much pent-up emotion, attraction, lust, and, yes, love- all culminating in a few passionate minutes at the end of a first date. That dressing room, which will always be part of our memories, a first kiss unlike any other, and a muffled orgasm in a slowly dying mall downtown.

That date was followed by so many more- the ones where we gallivanted around Dave and Busters, sat and talked by the water at night, and did nothing but make out for hours in the car. We had a mutual attraction, similar upbringing, and great conversations. It was everything I could‚Äôve asked for‚Ä¶ yet we both knew we weren‚Äôt for each other. Perhaps we wanted to live our lives in vastly different ways. Maybe we snuck around so much from your parents that when we no longer had to, something lost its luster‚Ä¶ its allure in our relationship. Or perhaps it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be.

Sometimes, things are inexplicable, and I‚Äôd like to stop thinking about it and chalk us up to unexplained circumstances. But it‚Äôs been six years since we first kissed, and I‚Äôm wandering aimlessly around that mall, our mall, for the last time in my life. I‚Äôm moving away and don‚Äôt plan on coming back. To the state for sure, the city perhaps, but never this mall. It is like so many other malls in America, but the memories make it unrivaled in my mind. Here‚Äôs the Starbucks we met at, and you recommended a summer thirst quencher from the menu. To this day, it is the only beverage I‚Äôve ever consumed from the coffee giant. There‚Äôs the wall we sat with our backs against and laughed together countless times, the Best Buy you danced in when I came with you to buy a new phone, and the VS in which you gave me a private modeling show.

I‚Äôm listening to the soft love ballad you coined as our song after your cousin used it for a first dance song at her wedding, the same one you played out of your cheap speakers the first time we made love. It sounded tinny and not quite right, but our inexperienced bodies managed to find a rhythm with it, a rhythm we never relinquished every time thereafter. It was never wild, primitive, or kinky. Yet, it never lacked passion. We were always in sync, and our bodies just fit together perfectly, climaxing in unison. We always took breaks when one of us dated someone seriously, but it felt so natural to have you back in my arms whenever that brief hiatus was over. 

We shared celebrations for almost a dozen birthdays between us, undergraduate degrees, getting jobs, and then moving up the corporate ladder. We cuddled and ate junk food after each of your breakups. You baked me cookies and sat with me through the ups and downs of school. In so many ways, we were lovers, star-crossed perhaps, but lovers nonetheless. And simply calling us friends with benefits would not do justice to the complexities and nuances of our relationship. There‚Äôs always that one person who keeps cropping up in your life, and I‚Äôm blessed that you were mine until now. 

I know you better than anyone else: your secrets, fantasies, desires, dreams, aspirations, and insecurities. I‚Äôm sure that from the hundreds of hours we spent talking, you know just as much about me, if not more.

So, deep down, I hope you somehow see this letter and recognize enough of it to know that it‚Äôs about you.

# Before implementing training, ensure program trainers will effectively address the unique circumstances faced by trainees.

Active shooter response training for utility professionals is a subject that shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. However, few subjects are as challenging or controversial.

For decades, active shooter response training has been touted as a one-size-fits-all remedy that instills long-lasting, actionable survival skills in one easy application. In reality, off-the-shelf training programs seldom deliver on promises. Training is often poorly delivered cookie-cutter sessions that focus on the wrong messaging and outcomes. Active shooter response programs are fraught with complications and issues that, if left unresolved, can make the training more of a hazard than a help.

You may think, ‚ÄúOK, so let‚Äôs just skip the training.‚Äù Sorry, but that‚Äôs not the answer either. Without practical and effective active shooter response training, your team may not have the skills needed to escape a lethal encounter.

Despite what you may believe, people are not naturally endowed with keen survival instincts and response skills that miraculously kick in when needed. Response skills must be learned and continually refreshed. Without a usable survival skill set, our fate ‚Äì as an individual or a group ‚Äì is ultimately left to chance. The bottom line is that not offering active shooter response training, or employing the wrong training, can have tragic results.

Let me be clear: I believe active shooter response training is a necessity and as important as any lifesaving safety skill being taught. The stakes are too high and the potential outcomes too catastrophic to depend on probability alone for protection. However, in any active shooter training discussion, the impacts of inadequate training and the consequences of not training must be considered.

Inadequate training produces inadequate results, including false assumptions and misguided outcome expectations. One poorly delivered active shooter response training session can simultaneously create debilitating anxiety in some attendees and lethal overconfidence in others; both are outcomes to be avoided.

Practical active shooter response training requires more than enthusiasm and a self-defense technique. It can‚Äôt rely on fixed procedures; disproportionately soft, G-rated (i.e., approved for general audiences) formats; or overly aggressive and gratuitous tactics. Effective training will address the unique circumstances faced by the audience using just enough tension to convey the gravity of the subject. For utility professionals, that means focusing on threats related to utility operations, work environments and hostile situations.

**Training Customization is Essential**  
Active shooter response training requires a custom fit that addresses the trainees‚Äô unique predicaments. This is especially true for those who work irregular hours in remote and nonsecure locations and regularly interact with hostile people, which is precisely what utility professionals do.

Beyond the conventional threats we‚Äôre all subject to, utility professionals also face distinct security threats and conditions. These include working in situations that often place them at a disadvantage. The job itself dictates the threats you face. Whether it‚Äôs working in an isolated location, on other people‚Äôs property or in a hostile community environment, you go where the job is.

A seldom recognized or understood conditional impact is the depth of emotion associated with access to utility services. Deep-seated emotions are tied to the resources that support our basic needs for lodging, water, sustenance and environmental control, and we‚Äôre quick to respond to any perceived threat to those resources. The response to a real or perceived threat can be violent and possibly lethal. Effective training will address hostility drivers, such as entrenched loss-of-service fear.

Practical active shooter response training will include scenarios faced by office and field personnel, either separately or in a comprehensive program that addresses both.

Program tailoring is critical to training success. Training that promotes responses and solutions that contradict the organization‚Äôs principles can create dilemmas for the utility and sets the stage for conflict; this must be avoided. Adjusting the training content and approach to an organization requires a little background work and conversations with key staff to ensure training alignment and alleviate any organizational concerns.

Typically, alignment adjustments are minor shifts or modifications. And while they may seem insignificant, they can drastically impact delivery and outcome. Untailored or misaligned training creates incongruencies between the information presented and operational reality. This incongruency can be significant if the trainer hasn‚Äôt recognized and filtered their personal biases from the training.

**Addressing Training Bias**  
Two sources of bias must be addressed for active shooter response training to be effective: trainer bias and audience bias. Before we delve into these, let‚Äôs make sure we understand what ‚Äúbias‚Äù actually means ‚Äì because people are inclined to wield the word like a hammer. Merriam-Webster defines bias as ‚Äúan inclination of temperament or outlook, especially a personal and sometimes unreasoned judgment.‚Äù

Everyone has biases, and though some are harmful or downright hateful, most are simply commonly held beliefs about correlations between events or actions and expected outcomes. They‚Äôre decision-making shortcuts based on assumptions, previous experiences and beliefs without supporting evidence.

Overcoming trainer bias is the responsibility of the trainer. In practice, their training approach must complement the organization‚Äôs established standards and policies. Voicing unfiltered or contradictory biases and opinions during training is counterproductive and unprofessional. When conducting active shooter response training, the trainer must examine personal biases and filter any that do not align with the organization‚Äôs positions or policies.

Audience biases can be incredibly challenging problems. The audience of any active shooter response training will have an array of preconceived biases as diverse as the audience itself. These include biases about the subject, the content and the trainer. To illustrate, let‚Äôs examine subject matter biases.

Subject matter biases about active shooter response training will fall into three groups: those biased toward the training, those biased against it and those who think it‚Äôs a waste of time. Those biased toward the training are looking forward to it and will want to get as physical as possible. They‚Äôll ask questions like, ‚ÄúWill this be a drill with weaponry?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan we tackle the shooter?‚Äù

The second group is biased against the training. They become anxious at the very thought of the subject. Their go-to response is fear and anxiety. They‚Äôre the ones who ask, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think this is too aggressive?‚Äù or state, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can do this.‚Äù

The third group has an indifference bias. They are predisposed to see the training as a colossal waste of time and money. They‚Äôre the ones who make comments such as, ‚ÄúWhy is this such a big issue now?‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis has never happened here and never will.‚Äù

The trainer‚Äôs problem is that they must train all three groups. For many trainers, not overcoming audience bias is their greatest point of failure.

**Effective Implementation**  
Successfully implementing active shooter response training is a challenge. There are myriad details, moving parts and things that can go wrong. Let‚Äôs look at three common challenges: reaching the entire audience, implementing the wrong training and poor trainer selection. We can deal with all three in one example.

As I stated earlier, reaching the entire audience is the greatest point of failure for many trainers. These trainers often fail to comprehend the need to adjust the training to the audience. In a previous article, I used an example of a security colleague who fell into this trap. He was new to his position as security manager for a midsized electric distribution utility, but he had outstanding credentials as a military officer and experience at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Over coffee one morning, he began discussing his plan to conduct active shooter response training. As we talked, it became clear that the training had all the earmarks of a military exercise: intense, aggressive and graphic. I realized that he hadn‚Äôt considered his audience‚Äôs diversity and biases. I expressed concern about his approach and offered to help. However, he felt he had a handle on the situation, so I wished him well and asked him to let me know how it went.

His goal was to make a memorable and lasting impression on the trainees. He accomplished that. Unfortunately, the training was so graphic and intense that he alienated half the attendees, and the level of pushback after the training cost him his job. This example highlights two truths: Civilian training isn‚Äôt the same as military training, and scaring people isn‚Äôt the same as training them.

The simple truth is that we teach what we know. Military and law enforcement training focuses on tactical response, which is great for them but not very useful for our industry. Utility professionals need active shooter response training that focuses on defensive response and escaping lethal situations ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not the forte of the military or law enforcement.

What about active shooter drills? Frankly, I‚Äôm not a big fan of them. Most are ill-timed, poorly designed and managed, and have negative consequences. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we conduct successful active shooter drills for clients on a regular basis, but we spend a lot of upfront time and effort to get them right. Push the idea of a drill down the road and skip the trauma and litigation risks for now. Begin with training that introduces active shooter response concepts and focuses on overcoming biased perceptions. Get the group positively engaged and oriented, then consider upping the intensity with a drill.

**The Bottom Line**  
In many ways, active shooter response training is a necessary evil. It is loaded with problems and pitfalls, but don‚Äôt ignore it. Just remember, doing it wrong can be as risky as not doing it at all. Take the time and put in the effort to do it right.

1jcy64j,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1jcy64j/a_holistic_framework_for_deciding_when_to_retire/,A Holistic Framework for Deciding When to Retire,"On this board the decision to retire is often framed as a question of hitting a certain number based on a ‚ÄúSafe Withdrawal Rate‚Äù. This is often for the purpose of making projections and so on, but still a lot of mental energy is spent discussing this or that number, or estimating one‚Äôs progress toward it, etc. What follows is a more holistic way of approaching early retirement, considering your withdrawal rate along with certain additional factors that could trigger retirement even if you have not hit 25X or 30X spending. Basically, as you approach a true Safe Withdrawal Rate, you can start to balance the risk of running out of money based on current spending versus other factors

  
**First, determine your financial independence baseline.** 

Financial independence is more of a continuum than an on/off switch. The more multiples of your expenses you have saved, the less risky your retirement. Depending on how much you have saved, you will need more factors on the side of retiring now. 

If you have achieved 20X expenses, you can retire with some risk. With average returns you will be fine, but with a market crash early in retirement there is a chance you could be forced to go back to work or dramatically reduce your lifestyle. You should have *multiple additional factors* on the side of retirement.

If you have achieved 25X expenses, you can retire with minimal (but some) risk. With extremely bad returns there is a chance you could be forced to go back to work or dramatically reduce your lifestyle. Still, retiring is probably the right decision, especially if you have *at least one additional factor* on the side of retirement.¬†

At 30X expenses or higher, you are basically safe to retire immediately, regardless of additional factors.¬†

**Second, consider additional factors for/against retirement.** Again, the more you have saved, the fewer of these you need. 

* *Is your budget flexible?* If your budget includes a lot of discretionary spending, you can easily cut expenses and lower your withdrawal rate should you encounter a poor sequence of returns. In actuality you have already achieved a Safe Withdrawal Rate, you are simply choosing to spend more.
* *Do you really, really hate your job?* If your job is having a noticeable effect on your physical or mental health, retirement could be worth the risk. Even though you would be taking some financial risk with an aggressive retirement, you would certainly be making yourself miserable while also risking your physical and mental health.¬†
* *Do you have a biological reason to retire now?* Perhaps your retirement dream involves physical things that you won‚Äôt be able to do at a more advanced age. Perhaps you have kids and don‚Äôt want to waste their childhood at your job. Perhaps you have a chronic illness or you have always wanted to retire by XX age for whatever reason. Aggressive reitrement may be worth the risk if there is a biological reason to retire now.¬†
* *Do you have the ability to earn income in retirement?* This could be through freelance work in your professional field, or something completely different like working in a coffee shop. Either way, a small amount of extra income could reduce stress on your portfolio in a poor sequence of returns scenario. As long as you are able and willing to work at least part time in retirement, you could run the risk of an aggressive retirement.¬†
* *Is the market at low valuations?* Perhaps you have your recently surpassed your FI number only to have the market crash. If you are close to your FI number in a low valuation market, you can theoretically retire with approximately the same confidence as someone at their FI number in a high valuation market.¬†

You can probably think of other ‚Äúadditional factors‚Äù. The point is, the decision to retire is not like an on/off switch determined purely by a mathematical calculation. There are other factors to consider. This is a general framework for considering them. ",34,1742165774.0,financialindependence,4,0.9,False
