thank you all in advance

I love funny dog videos so much so I rewatch them as many times as I can

I had to stop bringing it with me when we met up because it would become to much 

Your the sunset when it‚Äôs orange and red all I want to do is take a picture of you in that moment 

Your my sweet tea because when I wake up I send you a good morning text with a ton of exclamation points

I wait till you wake up for you to send a good morning text back trying to out do me in how many exclamation points you send back

Your like the funny dog videos I watch

I reread our text to make me laugh

1iwp7zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iwp7zg/arguments_leading_to_thoughts_i_dislike/,Arguments leading to thoughts I dislike,"
I don‚Äôt really know where to start. My girlfriend (20f) and me (22m) have been pretty much fighting everytime we call. We‚Äôre long distance and I constantly am getting upset at her behaviors. Yesterday she (while on call with me) randomly got approached by some stranger (some random guy at her uni) crying about his breakup and said he needed someone to talk to. She for some reason thought the best course of action was to just cut the call with me without telling me anything and then just disappeared for around an hour. Came back and started telling me what happened because I asked. Midway through her explanation I asked her if she believed that the best thing she could have done was cut me off when some dude comes to talk to her. She says no and apologized, etc. we continue fighting and she said she believed it required more urgency than our call and so she did it. 

I mean sure? But why did she have to cut me? Like this is some random dude (allegedly). This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs abandoned me for someone. I‚Äôm constantly being put second. I didn‚Äôt get anything for valentines either and it‚Äôs because ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt get to me in time so I couldn‚Äôt‚Äù. She said she‚Äôs bringing me one when she flies down. 

I‚Äôm just tired of being someone who puts in so much effort for her. I drop everyone for her. She knows she has me completely wrapped around her finger. But she would never do that for me. Even a random stranger takes priority over me. She evaluates everyone‚Äôs feelings except mine before doing anything. 

It‚Äôs gotten to a point that I‚Äôm so insecure, that I feel on edge all the time. 

I want to feel wanted. I can‚Äôt tell if she finds me attractive or not. I‚Äôve lost so much weight and worked so much on my physical, I‚Äôve refined myself. I‚Äôm in college for Biomedical sciences and I‚Äôm going into research after this semester. 

My need for feeling wanted has made me decide to go look for it somewhere else. I went out for a coffee with a classmate who has a boyfriend. But at least she appreciates me. At least she acts like it. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm losing my mind. She‚Äôs good in every way except the fact that she makes me feel like she puts everyone except me on a pedestal. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because she knows I love her; that she no longer has to put in effort. She has me already and that‚Äôs the end. 

AND before anyone says anything. yes. I have spoken to her about it. I actually spoke about it a lot with her but it seems to only get better for a few days and then it‚Äôs back to another new method for the lady to make me feel shit.

I feel repulsed. I don‚Äôt feel as attracted anymore and I almost never feel the mood to compliment. She‚Äôs reinforcing that because everytime I‚Äôm like that. She turns into the most loving amazing girlfriend ever. 

Only then though.

I‚Äôm pathetic. I don‚Äôt know what to do

TL;DR

Girlfriend shows priority to other people constantly, making me more and more insecure. I‚Äôve started seeking attention from others and feel horrendous.

Story #1 there was a girl looking  about she's in her late teens carrying a shoppers tote that she bought from the market. This 5'10 ft security walks up to her telling her that she's trying to steal the coffee when she was trying to get in line to purchase her coffee and it wasn't even in her tote bag. She tries to go to the line but insists on following her not keeping distance going into the harassment territory. I saw him follow her she started getting uncomfortable and doesn't want to buy the coffee anymore because he ruined her good shopping experience. She then proceeds to ask where the manager is and reports to him of falsely accusing her. The security guard sees her making a report to the manager and she looked back to the security guard looking at her , and the security guard was yelling out profanity saying that he's going to catch her a** ""I'm going to catch your a**!"" Yelling the same sentence 4 times like a broken record dj. The manager tried to put on a serious face but I pretty much saw him giggling and telling her that he'll have a talk with the security guard. I went up to her and told her ""sorry you had to go through that ,the security guard needs better manner training she asked to swap numbers to contact me as witness just in case she might have to escalate her report. The shopper and i agreed to meet to return to the store only to see the hiring manager didn't release him, the security is still there to harass more potential shoppers. So then the shopper girl went up to the security and told him  that he should get Mental help. And he responded ""how dare you try to make it seem like I'm Mental"" and she said"" Cause you are, sorry, but at least there's counseling and therapy available."" and she walked out the store

Story # 2.)

A male manager arranged to meet with my friend Amy posing as someone that's trying to hire urgently for the better of the company was looking to actually meet potential women to solely waste her time promising to hire her. He didn't hire anyone. The business is not even busy and they get tons of Negative reviews on yelp. I guess is good she was able a avoid a place with that reputation anyways. 

I have heard numerous of time that most people in California is flaky rude and whatever other words thats meant to describe a not good quality environment, people, place or things we could think of as much as I don't want that to be true,I totally See why. But don't let that stop you from having your fun trying to explore California, just make sure to go To popular tourist areas and shops with a trusted partner/ friend.

my(20f) 16 y/o sister is very sick. it started back in october, my grandma and i were in the hospital, and my other sister(18) and brother in law(21) were at work. she was left alone for some hours, and she took medication, and ended up choking on it and it really scared her. like, to the point where she stopped eating completely due to the fear of not eating. she would try to get down liquids, which she did, and she's seldom eat solids. we took her to the dr and he said that after a situation like that, it's common for children to be scared to eat. there's a name for it, but i've forgotten. well, flash forward a little bit & this issue is still ongoing, she's losing weight, and it's rapid. she's gotten to the point where she can't eat anything solid, she throws it all up. she can gets down liquids, but she takes the smallest sips known to mankind & they usually come back up later. we take her to the er, and they do ultrasounds and xrays but they can't find anything ""wrong"" with her. the not eating & not being able to keep much of anything down continues, she's losing weight rapidly, and losing strength. we've gone back to the er about 3 more times in the span of a couple of months, she just keeps getting worse, and they always find nothing and send us home. i took her to the er about a week and a half ago while my grandma was in the hospital again(my sister and i were staying with her,) so i took her to the er again, because she's really rough and can barely walk, and they do another ultrasound, and more xrays, along with a ct scan, and take blood. the blood tests come back that her liver enzymes are elevated, and that it's a cause for concern. in the ultrasound notes they say ""possible gallstones & sludge in the gallbladder."" but when the doctor comes in, they say she doesn't have gallstones, but does have sludge in the gallbladder. they let us go home and she says to schedule a follow up appointment with her primary doctor for more labs to make sure her elevated enzymes go back to normal. well, a day passes, and she tells me that there's now brown coffee ground looking stuff in her vomit occasionally, so i take her back to the er, but a different one this time. they do ultrasounds, xrays, and bloodwork, but essentially we get the same thing, they don't really find anything. they say her enzymes have gone back down, and that we're free to go. so we go back to my grandmas hospital room, and the next morning we talk to her surgeon and explain what's been going on, he tells us that he'll look into her issues and get back to us. he comes back again the next morning and tells us that her liver enzymes were not back to normal when we left the er the second time and that he doesn't understand why or how they could let her go with her enzymes elevated like that. he says that he can do the surgery to remove her gallbladder if needed, but he thinks there's more going on than just that & he wants labs done. he talked to my sister primary care to ask if they'd do her labs over at the primary care, and my sisters primary doctor says yes, so he tells the pc what labs he needs. i take her over there the next morning, and they do labs. we schedule a follow up appointment and it's not until the 25th. she has an endoscopy scheduled for tomorrow, the 24th. but today they took her to the er by ambulance because she fell the might before and couldn't get up for over an hour. i tried taking her to the bathroom, and i usually put my arms under her armpits and lift her to a standing position and then we walk about three feet to the toilet, but she just couldn't do it. she just fell under me. it's absolutely devastating guys, i'm feeling lost and don't know what to do. my grandma is too. all she does is cry now, we try getting her help, but always get sent away. we're begging and pleading, and they're hearing, but i don't think they're listening. my sister started off at 300 lbs(yes, i know it's insane, we were working on it) and in just 4 months, she's down almost 90 pounds. she's lost all the muscle she had in her arms and legs. i'm trying to hard to take care of her, my grandma just got out of surgery so she can't lift on her or anything. i just don't know what to do anymore, does anyone have advice? the only one who seems to really care is my grandmas surgeon, but he's out of office for 3 weeks because his wife and him just had a baby boy. i'll try to keep y'all updated, if you want to know. i just genuinely don't know what to do or how to get people to listen. if she were a normal weight she would have gotten admitted to the hospital early on. she's not been admitted once. we've been to the er 5 times and to her doctors like 3 times. this is a last resort kind of thing, making a post like this. please be respectful.",1,1740357045.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1iwoycf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unrivaled/comments/1iwoycf/recent_trip_for_2212025_weekend_and_tips/,Recent trip for 2/21/2025 weekend and tips,"I know I've seen similar posts and we're toward the end of the Unrivaled games, but just in case this is helpful to anyone, I just wanted to also give tips and recommendations. For some background, I flew in from a six hour flight, landed late Friday afternoon and left early Sunday morning so I was really just here to watch Unrivaled games and have one day in Miami. The first night I sat in the regular section and the second day I sat court side so had access to the lounge and it was a solo trip.

\- For those debating car rental vs. Uber/Lyft, if I did the same trip next year, I'd just do Uber/Lyft as I rented a car this year. However, if you're planning on doing a longer trip or visit the beach, the car rental is probably worth it. The Miami car rental center is a bit of a trek from the terminals and they do have moving walkways though some were broken. I saw a few families struggling with all of their luggage to get there.

\- I stayed at the Hyatt Place Miami Airport West - Doral and I'd highly recommend it for this type of trip. Free and easy parking (it's in an office plaza), there's a Raising Cane's a very short walk away, clean and safe, spacious rooms that had a somewhat separate living room area with an L shaped couch with microwave and large fridge, free daily hot breakfast, and if you have Chase points you can transfer to Hyatt, it's Category 2 so not a lot of points to book a room. The only complaint I'd have is the air conditioner seemed broken but it wasn't too cold for me and having the white noise in a hotel room is probably for the best. It's also ten minutes away from Costco if you wanted something cheap to eat (I needed a salad by the second day and no Marina Mabrey sighting unfortunately lol).

\- A lot of people have said this, but the food at the arena isn't great. I did try bringing in an empty bottle to fill at a water fountain but they only had one available if you had access to the courtside lounge so ended up just buying water the first night. The food in the courtside lounge was fine, beef, chicken, veggie kebobs and a pastry type dessert with dulce de leches inside, along with non alcoholic beverages. However, if you have time for dinner before or after the game and have a car, there's a fantastic Venezuelan grill food truck called Carne en Vara Express that's a six minute drive away and open late. I was there by myself and felt very safe getting food there after 10pm and they have plenty of outdoor picnic tables on the dirt lot. You may have to ask for an English menu but the cashier was very nice and I am definitely coming back here next year.

\- In terms of parking, I followed people's advice and just bought the regular parking pass right before heading out to the venue as they ask for your license plate number and I didn't know it until I had the car rental but they don't seem to run out of parking passes. There wasn't an issue leaving after the game either but if you're really worried, just reverse park into a spot near one of the gated exits when you park because they remove the gates after the game.

\- I'd also recommend showing up early mainly to watch shootaround beforehand, which I felt was 45-60 minutes before the game officially starts. I would avoid asking players to sign/take pics during shootaround if they're in the game but if they're injured and sitting there, I'd say go for it. Players/coaches do walk around the arena sometimes and get kind of mobbed. Bring your own silver sharpie and they do sell black sharpies there if you need it then. Sandy Brondello did sit behind me the second night and kindly took all photos and autographs, no matter what jersey you were wearing and was primarily approached between quarters and games. There was also a funny moment where she was waiting in line with the rest of us at the indoor bathroom for the courtside folks and after she went into a stall, everyone just talked about her like she couldn't hear us LOL.

\- I sat in row A in the regular section the first night but I may sit further back in the future. While great for taking pictures and getting autographs of players walking by, it was hard to see behind all the courtside folks as we were on the same level. 

\- That dog we saw a staff member carrying is not DiJonai or any player's dog, it is her own dog lol. Someone asked her.

\- If you're a kid with a sign saying it's your birthday and are sitting courtside, you will have the best time. On my second day, there was a birthday kid and her mom near me. The Unrivaled staff gave her a ball with as many autographs as they could get. Allisha Gray came to gift her sneakers (and she did it during the next game player intros so it was very dark and loud and not for publicity as the social media team couldn't take pics of it). Natasha Cloud came to give her a huge hug and wish her happy birthday. It was all very lovely and sweet and she seemed so surprised by each new gift :)

\- During the one day I was there, I'm more of a food person and not a beach person so I elected to visit Little Havana. Tinta Y Cafe had amazing sandwiches and coffee but can get crowded. El Rey De Las Fritas was a good bakery to take pastries back home though there's a $20 credit card limit. Azucar ice cream was good too, especially their #1 flavor of guava and cheese pastelito. I arrived at Calle Ocho at 9:30am on a Saturday and if you park behind the McDonalds, there's signs that'll tell you if you're in the right area but it's free until 6pm and perfect if you can't parallel park like me. There was a lot of parking available in the lot then but when I left a few hours later, it was full. There's a lot of beautiful murals on almost every building on this street so you can spend a lot of time here if you're into that. There's other famous, restaurants, cafes and sandwich shops here but only got to try what I mentioned. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope everyone else has just as amazing of a trip as I just had! Despite being there for less than two days, each night at Unrivaled was so fun (though Lunar Owls vs. Laces got less fun and the arena was pretty quiet when it became a blow out).

1iwovfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1iwovfp/just_came_out/,Just came out!!!,"So yeah, I finally did it. After months of sweating bullets, pacing my room, and overanalyzing every possible outcome, I came out to my family as trans (MtF) last night. I‚Äôm 20, been on this self-discovery rollercoaster for a while, and I just couldn‚Äôt keep it in anymore. Figured I‚Äôd rip the Band-Aid off and see what happens. Spoiler: it was messy, intense, and honestly kinda wild. Here‚Äôs how it went down.

My family‚Äôs not super religious, but my mom‚Äôs the type who‚Äôs got a Bible on the coffee table and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pray for you‚Äù whenever life gets dicey. Dad‚Äôs more chill, just grunts and nods through most conversations, and my older sister‚Äôs been off at college so she‚Äôs kinda out of the loop. I knew Mom would be the big hurdle‚Äîshe‚Äôs got this mix of old-school values and a loud personality that fills up a room. I love her, but damn, she‚Äôs a force.

I picked a random Tuesday night after dinner. Everyone was just kinda lounging‚ÄîDad scrolling his phone, Mom wiping down the kitchen counter for the third time, classic her. Heart was pounding so hard I thought it‚Äôd bust out of my chest, but I just went for it. Stood in the living room doorway and said, ‚ÄúHey, uh, I‚Äôve got something to tell you guys.‚Äù They both looked up, and I swear the air got thick.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm transgender. Like, I‚Äôm a girl. I‚Äôve known for a while, and I‚Äôm done hiding it.‚Äù Boom. Dropped it like that. No preamble, no script‚Äîjust raw and unfiltered. Dad blinked, put his phone down slow, and went, ‚ÄúHuh. Okay.‚Äù Typical Dad, man of few words. Mom, though? Oh boy.

She stopped scrubbing mid-wipe, sponge dripping on the floor, and stared at me like I‚Äôd just said I was joining a cult. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, a girl?‚Äù she asked, voice all sharp. I tried to explain‚Äîkept it simple, said I‚Äôve felt this way forever, that it‚Äôs not a phase, that I‚Äôm starting to figure out hormones and stuff. She cut me off with, ‚ÄúNo, no, hold on. God made you a boy. That‚Äôs how He planned it. You can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ change that!‚Äù

Cue the spiral. She went from confused to full-on preacher mode in like 10 seconds flat. Started pacing, waving her hands, saying stuff like, ‚ÄúThis is that internet nonsense filling your head!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat did I do wrong raising you?‚Äù I tried to stay calm, told her it‚Äôs not about her or some TikTok trend‚Äîit‚Äôs me, it‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs been eating me alive keeping it secret. Dad just sat there, watching us like a tennis match, until he finally mumbled, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all just‚Ä¶ breathe for a sec.‚Äù

Mom wasn‚Äôt having it. She hit me with the big one: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next? You gonna chop it off and ruin your life?‚Äù Oof. That stung. I snapped back, ‚ÄúNo, Mom, I‚Äôm trying to save my life here!‚Äù It got loud‚Äîyears of pent-up frustration just pouring out. I told her how I‚Äôd cry myself to sleep as a kid, how I‚Äôd stare at girls my age and ache because I knew I wasn‚Äôt one of them, not yet. She went quiet for a second, and I thought maybe I‚Äôd gotten through.

Then she started crying. Not loud sobs, just these soft, shaky tears. Said she didn‚Äôt understand, that she‚Äôs scared for me, that she doesn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äúlose myself.‚Äù It broke my heart a little, seeing her like that. I hugged her‚Äîawkward as hell, but I did‚Äîand said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still me, Mom. Just the real me.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt hug back right away, but she didn‚Äôt pull away either. Progress?

Dad finally piped up with, ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt get all this, but you‚Äôre my kid. We‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù Mom shot him a glare, but he just shrugged. She stormed off to her room after that, muttering about praying for guidance. I crashed on the couch, totally drained, texting my sister the whole saga. She‚Äôs 100% on my side‚Äîalready sent me a ‚Äúwelcome to girlhood‚Äù meme, which made me laugh through the leftover tears.

So yeah, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Mom‚Äôs still processing‚Äîheard her on the phone with her church friend this morning, whispering like it‚Äôs a scandal. Dad‚Äôs acting like nothing happened, which is honestly a relief. I‚Äôm not expecting rainbows and acceptance overnight, but I‚Äôm out now, and that‚Äôs something. Anyone else deal with this kinda religious family vibe? How long did it take your parents to come around‚Äîor did they ever? I‚Äôm just trying to keep my head up while Mom figures out if she‚Äôs gonna disown me or knit me a dress. (Kidding about that last part‚Ä¶ maybe.)",2,1740356419.0,trans,1,0.75,False

1iwotci,https://i.redd.it/xa3w63cnczke1.jpeg,This month‚Äôs empties so far + some thoughts about them ‚ú®,"Farmacy Honey Grail Facial Oil: I use this as a hair oil and I love it! It‚Äôs moisturizing and it smells good! I opened my new bottle yesterday.

Bath & Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar Body Lotion (decanted into two Farmacy Honey Halo Moisturizer jars and one face cream jar with a black lid because the lid broke): It smells nice and the texture is soft and creamy, but the scent sticks to the skin a bit too much for my liking. If I didn‚Äôt experiment so much with perfume I wouldn‚Äôt mind, but I do, so I mind üòÇ.

Farmacy Filling Good Hyaluronic Acid Serum: 10000/10, this is one of my skincare holy grails and has been a staple for me for about two years now! It helps immensely in controlling oil and reducing/preventing breakouts üëåüèæ. 

Farmacy Warm Vanilla Chai Green Clean Cleansing Balm: chai scents tend to make me nauseous and this is the least offensive chai scent that I‚Äôve come across. With that being said, I still wouldn‚Äôt repurchase it if it were to be sold solo (mine came in a three pack with two other scents). It‚Äôs phenomenal at removing makeup, it doesn‚Äôt leave a residue, and it doesn‚Äôt strip the skin. So, it performs amazingly.

Sol De Janeiro Delicia Drench Bum Bum Cream: this is my third jar of Delicia Drench. I love it. It‚Äôs luxuriously thick, creamy, and moisturizing! It is a perfumed body butter and the scent really sticks to the skin (and clothes) which I started to find annoying because I was testing a lot of new fragrances and if I wanted to wear this body cream, I had to make sure that my fragrance selection went with it. I won‚Äôt be repurchasing it for a while for that reason, plus I got bored of the scent toward the last few uses of this jar. Oh, I also got sick of the $48 price tag ü§£.

Tree Hut Coffee Body Scrub: Amazing! I love Tree Hut body scrubs. The texture is *mint* üëåüèæ and the scent is delicious! I wish I could find this scent again at my local TJ Maxx and Marshall‚Äôs stores but I haven‚Äôt seen it in months.

Farmacy Honey Potion Plus Mask: Great! I like the warming sensation and the light foaming! It‚Äôs one of the few masks that doesn‚Äôt bother my sensitive skin.

Sol De Janeiro No. 62 Bum Bum Body Scrub: One of the WORST body scrubs I‚Äôve ever tried. It was abrasive, dried out my skin for two whole days, and broke me out üò≠. 

Farmacy Honey Halo Moisturizer: 100000/10, this is another one of my holy grails and skin care staples! It makes my skin so hydrated and supple! It also helps immensely with oil control and reducing/preventing breakouts.

Refillable Pink Container: This held the last of my Ciroa Pink Rose & Oat Milk body butter that I had mixed with my Miim Miic No. 52 lotion. The Miim Miic No. 52 lotion is one the worst, most drying and watery lotions ever. Mixing some of it with the Ciroa redeemed it somewhat, but I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have done that to that little bit of my Ciroa.

Ouai Clarifying Shampoo: This was alright, but I realized that I was using it too frequently. Also, sometimes it would make my hair feel weirdly gummy after washing it out. I didn‚Äôt like that. When I decreased the frequency of use to once or twice a month, it stopped doing the weird gummy thing. I ended up being okay with it in the end.

Personal Care Cinnamon Churros Body Wash: THIS SMELLS SO GOOD. It doesn‚Äôt smell like cinnamon covered churros though! It took me a while to figure out what it reminded me of, but it dawned on me last night while I was using my new bottle. It smells exactly like Dolce & Gabbana Devotion!!! It also lathers really nicely and does a great job at cleaning the skin without stripping it.

Hollywood Beauty Almond Oil: Amazing hair oil, smells heavenly, horrible leaky packaging. For $5, I plan to buy it again and decant it into one of my old Farmacy hair oil bottles. 

Bodycology Cozy Fireside S‚Äômore Lotion: Smells like warm and cozy, and like a smoky sweet marshmallow dusted with cocoa powder. It moisturizes nicely.

Josie Maran Topless Tangerine Body Butter: The texture is sooooo thick, creamy, luxurious, and amazing. The scent? Awful. It smells like orange anti-acid tablets and orange kid‚Äôs chewable multivitamins - complete with the chalkiness. 

Patchology Under Eye Patches: These are fun! Akin to all of the other eye patches that I‚Äôve used, I don‚Äôt think they do anything. I just enjoy them as a little beauty routine that puts me in tune with myself with my body. I also enjoy the feeling of picking up and applying the lightly goopy, jiggly cooling patches to my under eyes üòÇ. 

P√ºr Mellow Eyes Under Eye Patches: These are horrible. They made my eyes burn like heck and I had to snatch them off about two minutes after applying them.

Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask in Strawberry: FINALLY! I have defeated the great behemoth! It‚Äôs very plush and moisturizes my lips very well. I like the firm texture that melts into your lips and becomes softer and easier to scoop out with use. I plan to avoid buying lip masks that are this large from here on out. I get bored and learned that I prefer a smaller pot that I can get through quicker so that I can try a new scent and get the satisfaction of using something up ‚ú®. I have the Laneige minis set from this past holiday that I‚Äôm excited to crack into now!!

Lanolips Lemonaid Lip Treatment: I loveeeee the scent (it smells exactly like fresh squeezed lemonade!) but I hate that the shimmer in it makes me look like my lips are ashy üòû. As a result, I only wore it to bed and never during the day or out of the house. I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy it again for that reason. 

Farmacy Honey Milk Toner: This is the first Farmacy product that I strongly disliked. It made my skin oily and sticky. I finished it up by using it as a hand and foot treatment. I didn‚Äôt really like it for those purposes either though and if I ever get another one in a gift with purchase, I‚Äôll just give it away.

Hi guys, I'm looking at the Legoland package deals on their website, and I see that ""parking"" is included in this package at Hyatt Place Vista which is 6.5 miles away from Legoland California. I know usually the hotel stays include complimentary parking, but I was curious if packages like these include parking AT Legoland California.

A hand to hold, a gaze to meet,

 Curly  hair to touch, and words so sweet.

To wipe the tears, to share the glee,

A shoulder's rest, for you and me.

To catch the drool, a tender care,

While silence screams, you're never there.

Just texts unanswered, cold and stark,

A missing piece, within the dark.

A kitchen's warmth, a meal to share,

Clean folded clothes, a gentle prayer.

Washed dishes gleam, a shopping spree,

Open doors wide, for you and me.

Heavy bags borne, a helping hand,

While messages drift, like shifting sand.

A silent phone, a hollow sound,

Where once sweet words, could still be found.

Morning's Coffee, a fragrant brew,

Pillows arranged, just for you.

A tidy space, a house so clean,

The market's best, a vibrant scene.

The elevator held, the groceries brought,

Every small kindness, dearly sought.

But here I wait, in aching dread,

For just a text, a word instead.

3 days ago I almost went through with something permanent. Suddenly my mom called, she said she missed me and asked if she could fly to my city after her work trip and hang out with me for a couple

Despite all wrong with me I‚Äôm trying: going to gym, finally on semaglutide, going back to therapy, applying for industry jobs.

All this to say: I‚Äôm still a loser but okay with it. I‚Äôm working on getting a more enjoyable job in pharma industry, I‚Äôm hitting the gym and eating better. I‚Äôm going to a therapist again.

## Are the AirPods Pro 2 the‚Å¢ Right ‚Å¢Wireless Earbuds‚Äå for You? Understanding Your needs

Before we ‚Å¢get into the nitty-gritty details, it's crucial to understand *why* you're considering the AirPods Pro 2 in the‚Å¢ first place. Are you deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem? ‚ÄçDo you prioritize top-tier active noise cancellation? Or are you drawn to their sleek design and effortless user experience and apple px retailer‚Å£ options? Understanding your priorities ‚Å£will help‚Å£ you determine if these earbuds still align‚Äã with your‚Å£ needs in 2025. Maybe you're ‚Å£looking‚Äã for‚Äå military airpods ‚Äçpro 2‚Äã price or the base px airpods pro 2 pricing. Perhaps you're‚Å¢ after ‚Å£authorized apple retailer‚Äã locations. Whatever your goal, we're aiming to provide clarity.

Think about how you‚Äôll primarily use your earbuds.Are you‚Å£ a frequent traveler who craves a tranquil sanctuary on noisy flights? A dedicated ‚Å¢gym-goer who needs ‚Äçsweat-resistant‚Äã buds that stay put?‚Äç Or a busy professional who wants crystal-clear calls and immersive music during your commute? Your answers‚Å£ to these questions will ‚Äçguide you in choosing the ‚Å§perfect pair.

[[Explore Top Rated px airpods pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=px airpods pro 2)
## Design and comfort: Still a Masterclass in ‚Å§ergonomics?

The AirPods ‚ÄãPro‚Äå 2 retain the iconic design ‚Å£language of their ‚Äãpredecessor, but with subtle ‚Å¢refinements. The slightly‚Äå angled stem and four diffrent‚Å¢ sizes of silicone ear tips (XS, S,‚Å§ M, L) ‚Å£contribute to a‚Å¢ secure and cozy fit for a wide range of ear shapes. I was able to wear‚Äç them for hours without any discomfort, a crucial ‚Å¢factor for long flights or‚Å¢ extended work ‚Å¢sessions and the px exchange airpods pro 2.

The charging case deserves a special‚Äã mention. The ‚Å§addition of a lanyard loop is a welcome‚Å§ touch and helps prevent ‚Äçaccidental drops. The ‚Äåbuilt-in speaker and ‚ÄçU1 chip‚Å§ for Precision‚Å§ Finding ‚Å¢are incredibly useful, especially ‚Å£if you're prone‚Äå to misplacing your earbuds. No‚Äç more frantic searches under ‚Äåthe couch cushions! The MagSafe charging case ‚Äåoffers versatility, allowing you to charge ‚Å£wirelessly or via‚Äå a USB-C cable.

Compared to the Pixel Buds‚Å¢ Pro, the airpods Pro 2 offer a more discreet and streamlined aesthetic. The‚Å£ Pixel Buds Pro have a more pronounced, rounded design that some users may find less appealing. Tho, comfort is subjective, so‚Å£ I recommend trying both pairs, if possible, to see which fits your ears best.

[[Explore Top Rated px airpods pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=px airpods pro 2)
## Sound Quality: Immersive ‚ÄãAudio That Still Impresses

The airpods Pro 2‚Å£ boast ‚Å¢extraordinary sound quality,thanks to Apple's custom high-excursion driver and amplifier. The sound signature‚Äç is well-balanced, with clear highs, rich mids, and ‚Å£punchy bass. The audio‚Å§ is detailed and vibrant,making music,podcasts,and audiobooks come alive. They indeed deliver premium apple px retailer audio quality. We test using a full suite of audio tests, and ‚Å§can state the airpods pro 2 sound ‚Äãquality remains amongst the‚Äã best ‚Äçon the market, even in 2025.

Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking enhances the listening experience, creating a more immersive and realistic soundstage. It's particularly effective for‚Äå movies and TV shows, making you‚Äå feel like you're right in ‚Å£the middle of the action. Personalized ‚Äçspatial audio further customizes the sound to your unique ear shape, optimizing the‚Äç audio delivery for an even more tailored experience.

The Pixel Buds Pro also offer excellent‚Å£ sound ‚Å§quality, with ‚Å§a slightly warmer‚Å£ and bass-heavier sound signature. While ‚Äåsome may prefer the Pixel‚Å§ Buds Pro's more emphasized bass, others may‚Äç find‚Å£ the ‚ÄãAirPods pro‚Äç 2's balanced sound more suitable for a wider range of genres.Either way,‚Äç both deliver‚Å¢ a high quality audio experience.

[[Explore Top Rated px airpods pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=px airpods pro 2)
## Active‚Äç Noise Cancellation: Still the Gold Standard?

Active‚Å¢ noise cancellation (ANC) is ‚Äåwhere the AirPods Pro 2 truly shine.Apple's H2 chip enables substantially ‚Äçimproved noise cancellation compared ‚Å§to the original AirPods Pro. They effectively block out ‚Äåa wide range of ambient noises, from the rumble of airplane engines‚Äå to‚Å£ the ‚Äåchatter of a busy coffee shop. I found them to be remarkably effective ‚Å£at creating a peaceful and focused listening environment, making them ideal for travel, work, or simply escaping the‚Äå chaos‚Äã of ‚Å¢everyday life. Comparing the airpods pro 2‚Äç noise cancellation with peers, they set the bar high,‚Äç and remain high.

Adaptive Audio‚Å¢ is another standout‚Äå feature. It intelligently ‚Å§adjusts‚Äç the ‚Å£noise ‚Å£cancellation and transparency mode ‚Äãbased on your ‚Äãsurroundings.

## battery Life: Enough Juice to Get You ‚ÄåThrough the‚Å£ Day?

In ‚Å£2025, battery life is‚Å¢ more vital than ever, and many are concerned about the airpods pro 2 battery life. The AirPods Pro 2 offer ‚Äçup to 6 hours of listening time‚Å§ on a single charge, and up to‚Äã 30 hours with‚Äã the charging case. ‚ÄãThese battery statistics are consistent with what is‚Äå advertised by Apple. With ‚Å§Spatial Audio and ‚ÄãHead Tracking enabled,‚Å£ the listening time drops ‚Äçslightly to 5.5 hours. Still, 6 hours‚Å£ is ‚Å§more than adequate for most users,‚Å§ and the charging case provides ample‚Äã power for multiple recharges. plus, just five minutes in the case gives you around an‚Å¢ hour of listening time.

The Pixel ‚ÄãBuds pro offer similar battery ‚Å§life, ‚Äçwith up to 7 hours of listening time with ANC off, and up to 11 hours with ANC on. The charging case provides up to 20 hours of additional battery life. While the Pixel ‚ÄåBuds ‚Å£Pro technically offer slightly ‚Å§longer battery life, ‚Äçthe difference is negligible ‚Äåin ‚Äãreal-world use.

## Apple's H2 ‚Å£and U1‚Äç Chips: The Secret Sauce

The brains‚Å¢ behind the AirPods Pro 2's‚Äã exceptional performance are the H2 and U1 chips. ‚Å£The H2 chip‚Å§ enables improved sound quality, active noise cancellation, and battery efficiency. It ‚Å£also powers features like‚Å¢ Adaptive Audio and‚Äå Personalized Spatial Audio. The U1 chip allows‚Äå for Precision Finding, making‚Äå it easy to locate ‚Å£your ‚Äãearbuds ‚Å§or charging case if‚Å£ they go ‚Å¢missing.

The Pixel ‚ÄãBuds Pro rely on Google's own custom chip,which also delivers impressive performance. Though, the H2 and U1 chips give the AirPods‚Å§ Pro 2 a slight edge in ‚Äãterms of overall ‚Äçresponsiveness and feature integration, ensuring the airpods pro 2 personalized spatial audio ‚Äãlives ‚Å¢up to the hype.

The AirPods Pro 2 also work seamlessly with Apple services like Siri and find My. You can use your voice to control music playback, adjust ‚Äåvolume, make calls, and ‚Äçmore. Find My makes it easy to locate your earbuds ‚Äåif they're lost or ‚Äçstolen.While the Pixel Buds Pro ‚Äãintegrate well‚Äç with Android‚Äå devices, they don't offer the‚Å£ same level of seamless integration as the AirPods Pro 2 do within the Apple ecosystem.‚Å¢ If you're heavily invested in Apple products, the AirPods Pro ‚Å£2 ‚Å£are a‚Å¢ natural choice.

Look for airpods pro 2‚Å§ for sale‚Äå to‚Äç see if you‚Å£ can get ‚Å¢an airpods pro 2‚Å£ discount. Check‚Å§ online to see if there are any available airpods pro 2 ‚Å£deals.

Considering their exceptional sound ‚Å§quality,‚Å£ top-tier noise cancellation, seamless‚Äç Apple ecosystem integration, and overall polished experience, the AirPods Pro‚Å§ 2 offer excellent value for users who prioritize these‚Äå features. If you're on a tighter budget, ‚Å£the ‚ÄåPixel ‚ÄåBuds ‚ÄãPro‚Äç offer a compelling ‚Å¢alternative, but they don't quite match the ‚Å§AirPods Pro ‚Å¢2 in‚Å§ all areas. consider airpods pro ‚Äå2 availability too.

I remember the first time I tried explaining the verb *prestare* to my Italian students. It was like trying to teach a cat to swim. They looked at me as if I‚Äôd suddenly started speaking Martian. But then, I shared a story about my neighbor Luigi, who‚Äôs always lending me his lawnmower, and it clicked. Just like that, the penny dropped!

**Understanding *prestare***

In Italian, the verb *prestare* means **""to lend""**. It‚Äôs a regular verb, so it‚Äôs as predictable as your morning coffee. Here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs both a **transitive** and **intransitive** verb. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife of verbs‚Äîversatile and handy. 

**Conjugation highlights**

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:
- **Presente**: *Io presto*
- **Imperfetto**: *Io prestavo*
- **Passato Prossimo**: *Ho prestato*
- **Futuro Semplice**: *Prester√≤*

**Everyday expressions**

*Prestare* isn‚Äôt just about lending your favorite book:
- **Prestare attenzione**: Pay attention. Like when you're listening to your grandma's stories.
- **Prestare aiuto**: Offer help. Think of lending a hand to a friend in need.
- **Prestare servizio**: Work. Imagine working at an NGO, making the world a better place.

**Lend vs. borrow**

Ever wondered how Italians say ""to borrow""? They use **prendere in prestito**. It‚Äôs like saying ""to take on loan.""

1iwog7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyEmployers/comments/1iwog7m/terminating_temporary_nanny_with_no_notice_aita/,Terminating temporary nanny with no notice? AITA,"I am unexpectedly living in another state because I got into a horrible accident while visiting family and had to have surgery. I have a toddler, so going back to the city my husband and I live in was not an option. It‚Äôs been overwhelming, and a tough adjustment for all of us as it‚Äôs unexpected and I‚Äôm now wheelchair bound for 3 months. 

I put out a position for a 12 week part time nanny to give my mother in law a break in the day so she can run errands, take time to herself etc. watching a toddler 24/7 is exhausting, especially at her age. I hired the first person I interviewed, as she seemed nice, and it‚Äôs not a long engagement. Im also hanging by a thread emotionally- I suffered from horrendous PPD/PPA and was finally in a good place before the accident occurred.

The nanny insisted on more hours than we originally needed, and a higher end rate (both things we agreed to without question). Things started out ok, but my first indication that something was off with this nanny was that my little dog grabbed my daughter‚Äôs toy one day and she scolded the dog and firmly tapped (essentially hit) her on the back. Things began to go downhill from there. She stopped taking my daughter for walks outside or to the park/pool (which was specifically requested for the position as I can‚Äôt take her to do those things a wheelchair). My mother in law had to have a talk with her because she had left dirty diapers and baby clothes on the floor (and not picked them up after baby started napping, I get maybe it can‚Äôt be done right away). Nothing changed. She began putting my daughter down earlier and earlier for naps, arguing with me that she was ‚Äútired‚Äù when I told her my daughter only woke up 1.5 hours ago. She would put her down and curl up with a blanket on our couch- 3 people in the house on 3 separate occasions caught her napping on the job. I have NO issue with people having a break, but to be lounging in the couch when the basic baby care organization (tossing diapers, cleaning the dishes she used to feed her, cleaning wet towels and trash out of the wagon) hasn‚Äôt even been done, that‚Äôs frustrating.

On Friday I reached the end of my rope, I came down to get a morning coffee and she was already saying it was time for my daughter‚Äôs nap (it wasn‚Äôt, she‚Äôd only been up for an hour and a half we get her to stay up for a much larger window on weekends). I suggested taking her for a walk and she told me it was ‚Äútoo cold‚Äù I said it‚Äôs 70 degrees out, and we come from an extremely cold state so I‚Äôm happy to provide a jacket for the baby but I feel the temperature is totally fine. 

She reluctantly left (while in an annoyed mood) then brought the baby back early, put her down and curled up on the couch without even touching the bin of poopy diapers in the babies room (she‚Äôs the only one that uses that bin). Babies clothes were also thrown on the floor downstairs and not ever picked up. I spoke to my mother in law who said she has wanted to let her go for a while, and feels my daughter often seems unhappy around her. As a last attempt at a gut check, I asked my mom when I picked her up from the airport to see how she thought she was when we visited a few weeks ago. My mom admitted that she didn‚Äôt want to stress me out, but the nanny had spent over an hour trying to order concert tickets while on the job (during baby‚Äôs awake time), and spent the entire time on a walk with the baby talking on the phone to friends. My mom expressed concern that if she acts this way in front of my parents, what is she doing when no one‚Äôs around.

Frustrated, I snapped and sent her a text message saying we were thankful for the help she‚Äôs provided during a tough time, but my mom is going to stay long term until we go back home, therefore we no longer need a nanny for the baby. She never responded. If she did respond asking if anything went wrong, I would have been honest, but I don‚Äôt think she even cares.

Was this too harsh? Obviously for long term positions you have agreements and severance etc, but I am already frustrated at how we‚Äôve been giving the benefit of the doubt for weeks, I feel taken advantage of. I don‚Äôt feel she has been respectful of me and my family, so I don‚Äôt see why I should owe her any form of severance given the fact that this was always a temporary role- but maybe I‚Äôm being crazy?

For the first time in 3 years, I decided to go to my SD (17) recital. I always worry about their mom, so I had been avoiding going to any event where there mom would be. For context  their mom is very high conflict and blames me for the end of her relationship with my SO, even though I wasn't even in the picture when they split. She hates me to the point she broke in and stole all my stuff from the apartment once (see my post history). 

However, I love my SD and want to support her. I have been the one paying for her voice lessons and encouraging her to learn music, so I really wanted to be there to hear her sing, especially that my SD actually invited me and wanted me there.

We arrived early to make sure we would have a table (it was in a coffee shop) and we invited my SO's mom and his brother to kinda make it more of a barrier to his ex trying to talk to me. 

What happened is worst than I ever thought she would do. As soon as she saw me she lunged at me yelling. Her boyfriend and my SD are the ones that stopped her and got her out. My SD was in tears and didn't perform as all she wanted was to leave.

For one of the sororities, I went to their events and didn't receive a single invite back. They only did two events, and on the second one, they started handing out invites at the event in front of me. They called girls outside and they walked back in with envelopes. The girls talked to me a lot at first but at the second event, they barely talked to me at all. They were just on their phones/talked to each other and the PNMs they wanted.

For the second one, I thought I vibed with them well. I guess they didn't with me though. This one hurt because I had friends/mutuals in this one. I went to their two events, and they didn't send an invite for the invitationals. One of the officers said that if I wanted to set up a coffee date I could, so I did after not receiving an invite. I had a good time, but immediately the day after I got the rejection notice. I will admit I felt led on. I wish they had told me they weren't interested instead of accepting the coffee date request. They said they had a lot of spots they wanted to fill, but they only filled it with half the amount needed. My friend who went to one of their events for fun (didn't want to do informal) ended up getting a bid.

For both, I think I was the only person who didn't get a bid. I don't know what to think but honestly, I feel like I was a little disrespected. This turned me off from sorority life a bit, but we'll see if I go again in the fall. Should I try for these sororities again? And yes, the other sororities at my school wasn't doing COB.

In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it's easy to get caught up in the endless cycle of tasks and responsibilities. We often forget to take a step back and truly appreciate the present moment. Time has a funny way of slipping by, and before we know it, days turn into weeks, weeks into months. Yet, in all that rush, we might miss out on the simple joys that surround us.

Have you ever just paused to listen to the sound of birds singing, or felt the warmth of sunlight on your skin? Maybe it's a smile from a stranger or a quiet moment with a cup of coffee. These seemingly small things are what make life meaningful. 

It's important to remember that life is not only about achievements, deadlines, and goals. Sometimes, it's about slowing down, appreciating the beauty around us, and embracing the present. The past is behind us, and the future will come in its own time. What matters most is what we do right now.

Take a few moments today to breathe deeply, look around, and really see the world you're living in. Life is a series of fleeting moments, and it's up to us to make them count.

Remember, you're doing great. Whatever you're facing, take it one step at a time. You've got this!",1,1740354566.0,VerifiedWiHookups,0,1.0,False

I'm not hating, but every once in awhile, the texture of the mac n' cheese is pretty different. Most times it's very thick and gooey, with the sauce clumping to the noodles more like a homemade baked mac n cheese. The second is much more liquids, with smaller noodles. I prefer the second because I get to dip my bread in the liquidy sauce at the end. Is this a cooking method or a completely different brand? Is there any way (without being annoying) that I could ask for the second? Thanks

However, she's always with her friends and I've been waiting way too long with making a move because of this. It's not necessarily because I'd feel embarassed if she rejects me, but I just don't want her to feel pressured or embarassed herself if I ask her in front of her friends and I don't really know what would be the best way to approach her. It's just that she always sits with them in class, has lunch with them, and goes home and it's also not like I want to follow her to the bicycle shed. I'd just love for it to be a natural interaction, but I think I might have to wait another decade before there is 'a perfect moment'.

We almost always sit one row in front or behind each other, so I'd like to know from another woman; would you be okay with a guy turning around and asking you out, while your friends sit next to you or should I ask you if you have a minute for me during the break. Still a giveaway, but less direct I suppose...

What do you suggest?

1iwo5fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwo5fb/everyone_in_my_town_is_disappearing_they_call_it/,Everyone in My Town Is Disappearing. They Call It Sulaaphoria.,"My town is old. Its roots deep and tangled, drinking something that has always been here. Almost everyone can trace their blood back to the first settlers‚ÄîFinnish immigrants who laid the first bricks, built the first roads, carved the town from the earth. They came in boats, arrived in winters, walked the frozen forests and built homes where the ground swallowed their footprints.

On the surface, it‚Äôs like any other small town. Quiet. Insular. Familiar.

But there‚Äôs a tradition here. Something that doesn‚Äôt belong to us, but we carry anyway. Something older than the town itself.

Sulaaphoria.

The church bells ring for it. The radio hums with it. The diner booths whisper it over black coffee.

It used to happen rarely. Once, twice a year, after long dedication, like a prize at the end of devotion. Now, it happens every day.

Somewhere, someone is Achieving.

Somewhere, someone is gone.

\---

The first time I witnessed someone achieve Sulaaphoria was at the bar with Melody.

‚ÄúDid you hear about Hansel?‚Äù she asked, swirling her drink. ‚ÄúHe achieved last night. Just lay in the snow and‚Äîpoof. Gone.‚Äù

Hansel had vanished two weeks ago. The night after that, Dave spent hours lowering himself into hotter and hotter water, grinning as steam curled from his skin. Melody and I were growing desperate.

We had tried everything. Wax burns, sauna sits, fasting until our ribs counted for themselves. Nothing. We were still here.

That night, the bar was packed, wall-to-wall. No laughter. No breaking glass. The usual drunken shouting had been replaced by something quieter. Something electric.

I tapped someone‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

Artur turned. Gaunt, cheekbones carved sharp, his skin stretched thin from months of the Water Diet. He had the look of someone almost there. Someone waiting to be taken.

‚ÄúThey found a new way,‚Äù he whispered.

At the center of the room, three young men stood in black togas, each holding a shot glass.

The crowd held its breath.

In perfect unison, they drank.

A single second stretched, unbearably long.

The air shimmered.

Then‚Äîtheir bodies softened, blurred at the edges, like a heat mirage. The folds of their skin began to separate, like liquid pulling apart. The moment hung, viscous, heavy.

They dissolved.

Their clothes collapsed onto the floor, still damp with sweat and spilled liquor.

Sulaaphoria! The crowd erupted. Cheers. Shouts. People slamming their glasses down on the bar, ordering rounds of tequila. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have what they had.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all it took?‚Äù Melody nudged a crumpled toga with the toe of her shoe. ‚ÄúHow long have we been trying? All they did was‚Äîwhat? Do some fucking shots?‚Äù

People were vanishing everywhere now. A diner had lost their entire staff overnight. Kids wandered the streets, their parents gone mid-breakfast, their plates still warm. It wasn‚Äôt that it was strange. Just disappointing that it hadn‚Äôt happened for me.

I ordered a shot of tequila‚Äîsame as the three from before. I closed my eyes as I tipped it back. Swallowed. Waited.

Nothing.

The bar was suffocating. My vision doubled. Was this it? Was this the moment before? Maybe I wanted it too much.

Through the blur, I saw Melody across the room, swaying, eyes fluttering, deep in conversation with a group of strangers. I pushed through the crowd. Their words tangled together‚Äîmelting, dispersion, flux‚Äîall spoken with an evangelical urge.

‚Äú‚Ä¶it wraps around you, pulls you through, then bam‚Äîgone.‚Äù

A man turned toward me, his expression shifting. ‚ÄúWhat? Have you seen?‚Äù

The world tilted.

Something clenched in my stomach. My breath felt too slow. The lights smeared across my vision.

I muttered something‚Äîmaybe something blasphemous. It was one thing to speak of how someone Achieved. It was another thing entirely to claim to know what happened after.

Only the Ones Who See had that right.

His expression darkened. Before I could react, his fist caught me across the jaw.

I hit the floor, too dizzy to get up.

The crowd laughed, Melody shouting for them to stop, but I hardly noticed.

The floor was sticky with sugar and evaporated beer.

It was warm.

Hopeful.

My limbs numbed. The bodies above me blurred, undulating like wax, shifting, changing, melting into each other.

Then I saw him. The man who hit me.

His skin creased.

Pulled open.

Unzipped.

Droplets of him lifted into the air, tiny globes of light reflecting the faces of the crowd. Each drop held something‚Äîa memory, a moment, dissolving, fading away.

His body remained for a second longer. Hollow.

Something moved inside.

A thread-thin worm, white and delicate, crept forward. It lingered, drinking up the droplets. Pulling them into itself. It did not look hurried‚Ä¶or full.

By the time I blinked, there was nothing left but clothes.

The music swelled back into focus.

The crowd cheered, bodies pressing against each other, breath warm, damp, drunk with it all.

I turned to Melody, my breath unsteady. ‚ÄúWhat was that? Did you see that?‚Äù

She scoffed, kicking at the empty clothes on the floor.

‚ÄúYeah, a bunch of bullshit is what that was.‚Äù

\---

I didn‚Äôt remember getting home.

I woke up to a hangover and a phone call.

Melody‚Äôs mother.

She was crying, but it wasn‚Äôt grief.

‚ÄúShe was so sick after the bar,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI told her, that‚Äôs what happens, but then... the vomiting stopped and‚ÄîSulaaphoria.‚Äù A breath, shuddering. *Reverence.* ‚ÄúIt was beautiful, Jessica. I wish you could have been there.‚Äù

Melody was gone. Just like that.

I pressed my hand to my stomach, waiting for something to twist, to ache‚Äîbut I only felt empty.

As it says in The Methods of Sulaaphoria: The dispersed live on your breath.

So, I exhaled.

I collapsed back into bed, tried to sleep the rest of it off.

\---

I kept the radio on while I worked the next day.

93.7 FM‚ÄîThe Melt.

The host‚Äôs voice was warm, unhurried. ‚ÄúA record number of Achievements this season, folks. We‚Äôll be taking calls after the break‚Äîwho do you think will be next? Could be you, could be me, could be your next-door neighbor. Ain‚Äôt it a beautiful thing?‚Äù

Outside, people sipped coffee at the caf√©, gossiping about who might be next. The diner across the street was short-staffed again‚Äîmore empty aprons left in the back, more half-eaten meals cooling on abandoned plates. No one seemed alarmed.

I kept shelving books, trying to focus, but my fingers caught on something strange.

A book I didn‚Äôt recognize.

It wasn‚Äôt in the system. No barcode.

A pamphlet slipped free.

Its cover was cracked, gold lettering peeling at the edges. But I knew the word. Sulaaphoria.

Beneath it, a subtitle: The Tracts of the Seers.

Inside, the handwriting was uneven, jagged, smudged where the ink had been pressed too hard.

A passage caught my eye.

‚ÄúAbe the First went away with the snow, and Clare followed in the water.‚Äù

We all knew that phrase. One of the first things we were taught. A simple way to remember the Methods.

But beneath it, in handwriting that did not belong to the original text:

Who saw them go? A Seer.

A weight settled in my chest.

Someone had left this here. Someone wanted me to read it.

At the back of the pamphlet, a note.

Come before sundown.

An address.

I shut the book, tucked the pamphlet inside.

I could pretend I never saw it. I could throw it away.

Instead, I grabbed my coat and stepped out into the cold.

\---

The windshield was frozen over, a thin pane of ice sealing me in. A perfect sheet of white, like the world outside had been scrubbed away. I turned on the defrost, but the cold clung stubbornly to the glass.

I reached into the backseat, fingers stiff as I fumbled for the scraper. My knuckles ached, the dry air pulling at my skin. The moment I touched the handle, something shifted.

A whisper.

Soft at first, curling at the edges of my ears, barely louder than my own breath. It was easy to ignore, like the sound of the house settling at night, the distant hum of a streetlamp, something just on the verge of being real.

The ice on the windshield cracked. A fine, hairline fracture webbed outward, slow and deliberate.

The whisper wasn‚Äôt alone.

More voices joined, layering, shifting, a chorus pressing against my ears. Some were too distant to hear. Some felt too close. My breath came shallow, my pulse knocking against my ribs. The voices tangled, rose, folded over each other. The more I tried to make sense of them, the worse it became.

My name. Not spoken but exhaled.

‚ÄúMelody?‚Äù I whispered.

The windshield groaned. The fractures deepened, spidering outward, the ice straining against itself, warping under a pressure I couldn‚Äôt see. It wasn‚Äôt the defrost. It wasn‚Äôt the heat. It was something else.

A quote from The Methods of Sulaaphoria came to me: They live at the moment of liminal matter.

I gripped the scraper tighter, but my hands were useless. The voices wove through the air, a low hum beneath my skin, a vibration in my bones. The glass shuddered.

I was sitting in my car, the heater blasting, and I had never felt colder.

A voice, breathless and hollow, like wind through bone.

""Jessica.""

I threw the door open and stumbled onto the pavement, the cold biting into my skin. My breath came hard and fast, vapor pluming into the air.

The world had emptied.

No wind. No whispers. Just the weight of the quiet pressing down on me, thick as snowmelt.

I stood still, waiting. My ears rang with the absence of sound. My fingers flexed around the scraper.

The windshield was still frozen, the fractures holding steady. The ice had just begun to melt.

I forced myself to move, scraping away at the frost, my hands trembling.

I should have gone to the address.

I didn‚Äôt.

Instead, I went home.

\---

The house swallowed me whole.

The door shut behind me, the air thick, humid, stale. I stood in the dark, waiting for my body to feel like it belonged to me again.

I called for my dog.

""Arcades?""

No paws against the wood, no skittering claws.

""Come here, bud.""

Silence. The kind that settles over a graveyard.

I stepped into the kitchen. The faucet dripped, the sound loud in the stillness.

The water in his bowl rippled.

His collar rested beside it, the red nylon damp, coiled into itself like shed skin. His tag gleamed under the kitchen light, unreadable, as if the letters had been smudged out.

I knelt, reaching for the collar.

It was still warm.

I pressed my fingers to the floor where he should have been.

No fur. No sign that he had ever existed except for the space he left behind.

This isn‚Äôt happening, I thought. Animals don‚Äôt Achieve. Do they?

I thought about calling someone, anyone. But who would I call? Melody would know what to do. But Melody was gone. My father was gone to the mist off a boat and my mother in the steam of a shower.

Something moved in my peripheral vision.

I turned. The water in Arcades bowl trembled, a single ripple breaking across the surface.

I bolted to the bathroom.

The mirror was fogged over. My reflection barely visible, warped, stretched.

I peeled off my jacket, turned the shower knob, and let the steam rise like breath from a chasm. Heat wrapped around me, thick and cloying, dampening my skin before the water even touched me.

I stepped inside.

The hot water pounded against my skull. My muscles loosened, my thoughts dissolved. I closed my eyes and let myself drift.

""Jessica.""

My eyes snapped open.

Water streamed down the walls, gathering in slow, crawling rivulets. The steam thickened. Something moved in it. Not a shape or a person. Just a sense of something.

""Jessica.""

I turned too fast, feet slipping against the wet tile. Caught myself on the wall. My fingers dragged through the condensation, leaving frantic, smeared lines.

The whisper came again.

Closer.

""Jessica.""

The steam curled around me, pressing into my skin, heavy, clinging.

A dozen voices. A hundred. A thousand.

Then they all spoke at once.

""Seer.""

The air snapped, the voices vanished, the steam exhaled.

I stumbled back, hit the shower knob.

I clutched the sink, staring at my reflection through the thinning fog. My face looked wrong. Hollow.

The whispers were gone. But they weren‚Äôt really. They had always been there hiding in the liminal matter. I understood.

I turned off the water. Pulled on my clothes with shaking hands.

I didn‚Äôt want to be in the house anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone anymore.

I grabbed the Tract of the Seers and my car keys.

The note had said: Come before sundown.

I was going.

They said I was too wound up, I won't look anyone in the eye when I get overwhelmed, I mumble, and I am rude and mean to them.  I apologized to them, bought everyone lunch (which I was going to do anyway, because I really appreciate them); but inside, I was devastated. I know it's true, too. I can feel it when I am starting to meltdown. I really thought I was hiding it. I am glad they talked to me  so I can be more aware of  my behavior. I asked them to just say ""you're starting to spin"" when I start acting mean (Because that is what it feels like in my head).

1iwo4ks,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwo4ks,[Salitre Magico] & [Parque Del Cafe] Colombia Trip Report,"Landed in Colombia on Friday for a weekend of sightseeing and rollercoasters. 

On Saturday morning we went to [Salitre Magico] for opening at 10:30am and it was pouring rain. There were maybe 20 people waiting to go in. They wouldn‚Äôt let anyone into the park until the rain slowed down into a drizzle and warned us that the coasters may not even open. 

However after about 2 mins of them letting us in they opened up [Doble Loop.] This coaster feels pretty janky as expected and the restraints hurt your shoulders as they feel pretty small but was fun nonetheless. 

There was a sign saying [Magnus] was closed for the day but we saw an empty train go as we got off of Doble loop so we headed over. To our luck they did open the coaster and we got to ride this 40 year old relocated arrow. It hurts just like you would expect. 

There is a strict max height of 4 foot 11 for the wacky worm [Gusano Loco] so no luck there. 

They opened up [Drakko: The Flying Beast] exactly at noon and it‚Äôs your basic sky rocket 2.. but it has no comfort collars and it has 2 loading platforms and a switch track like Ice Breaker to allow multiple trains. Idk how Busch gardens didn‚Äôt invest in that. 


This morning we took a 25 min flight from Bogota to Armenia to head to Parque Del Cafe. We arrived in Armenia at 10:15, and got to the park around 10:45 after our uber. The park opens at 9 and it was decently crowded but the ops here are great and the lines moved quick.

To get into the park you have to ride down a hill in a cable car. To get to the coasters prepare to walk what feels like 3 miles up and down bridges. 

First up was the brand new coaster [Avix] my first time on the inverted infinity coaster model. This thing is short and compares to something like phoenix rising. The steep lift was cool though. The airtime hill over the queue was pretty awesome too. 

Next up was [Krater] a clone of Iron Shark and Tantrum but my first of the 3. I was surprised to find the ride had only lap bars which made the riding experience great compared to other Euros I‚Äôve been on. 

We then had a ride on [Yippe] a cool family coaster with a launch out of the station and follows the terrain quite well. There was several fountains the ride goes around and what looked like was supposed to be a splashdown but it was not working today. The ride was fun though. 

Unfortunately when we went to [Montana Rusa] it was closed for maintenance, which was a shame as we wanted to ride the original Zinger from worlds of fun. 

The park also has cool things like a coffee museum with a tasting, horse back riding, a suspension bridge and more. 

Overall it was a great trip. Im writing this from Armenia airport waiting for my flight back to bogota. 8 hours is plenty of time if you are planning a similar day trip. ",6,1740354299.0,rollercoasters,3,1.0,False

This is not a quick fix, it took around a couple of years. 

It is not easy either, you need to be very determined to succeed. The organism that is responsible, I have identified as an archaea. The most bizarre revelation is; many/most infected persons will choose to defend their archaea parasite.

This archaea phenomena is recognised by medical science in 'lesser' creatures, however, this is the first revelation that this is the same for humans and also the first identification of an archaea human infection.

The greatest challenge to beating this infection is; having the strength of will that is required to overcome the psychological influence. Many do not have this power of will and consequently, alternatively will fight to protect their archaea parasite.

This archaea organism proliferates in hydrogen sulphide gas that accumulates in poorly managed sewers.

There is no shortage of these and which is why this infection is now a covert pandemic.

Further too my dissertation I have since been researching globally and have found that covertly MD is a major pandemic. Around 1 million per year in USA, 1m per year in Russia, 1m per year in China and 1m per year in India. Don't take my word for this, simply ask Google, one country at a time. I stopped searching because what I was finding was frightening.

The association with Lyme disease is simply; these two infections are present in the same environments, people who have both, have 'merely' been unlucky. This is undeniable once my work is read.

It took me 2 years to unravel these abstracts into understandable words. This is a 35k word dissertation that I have helped along its way with visual aids and humour. It is not quite perfect, at the final edit during setting, the centre alignment Gremlin sneaked back in in 2 or 3 places and 2 or 3 minor final edits reverted.

But nothing much in the great scheme of things.

This is presented in a 'diary' format, which includes; the good the bad and the ugly along the way.

However, the greatest anomaly of them all is, more than 90% of people won't or can't read this.

I have lost count of the number of requests that I have had asking me to explain my work in a single sentence!

I have managed to deliver this cure into several tens of thousands of MD sufferers email inboxes.

This has resulted with 3 x 'thanks', not a single cup of coffee and several hundred persons rhetorically setting fire to their underpants in public campaigning against it, even though they haven't read it. I hope that is not the case here, nevertheless, I do expect this. This is the bizarre nature of an archaea infection in humans that medical scientists are unaware of until they read my work and witness the response. This is quite remarkable!

This information is new to medical science, before medical scientists even know about it.

I have presented my work to President Donald Trump and RF Kennedy and requested for a peer review from John Koo MD to qualify this revelation for their Make America Healthy Again' project. My work has revealed far more than merely the solution for Morgellons Disease. This discovery of human archaea infection has revealed solutions for medical mysteries that could benefit around 60% of the world population, around 4.8 billion people. 

I have worked very hard to explain this as best I can and have spent my life savings on finding this cure and presenting my work on a website as my Legacy to the World. 

I have no time whatsoever to waste answering idle text grunts.

Nevertheless, I am more than happy to answer any questions that anyone may wish to ask.

However, I WILL NOT ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION FROM ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BOTHERED TO READ IT.

Thank you

I've been talking to this guy on Hinged who seems really nice. We've had a much deeper conversation so far than I usually have on the apps, and he's very receptive and communicative. He also seems to have a lot of friends, a good job, and can cook. He is new to my area but seems to know a few people here already.

He invited me out for coffee, to which I responded I don't drink coffee but could do tea. He told me when he was free and I picked one day, which we agreed on. All was well until he said that we should go to whatever is my favorite place, which goes against my rule. I tried to give him some grace since I know he is new to the area, and also maybe he thinks he is being kind by letting me pick. So I decided to try to communicate my expectations in a kind way. Our conversation went like this:

Me: I don‚Äôt really have a favorite place, so I‚Äôm open to whatever!

Him: Hmm! We can find something. I‚Äôm still learning but I‚Äôm sure a lot to find

Me: I totally feel that you're trying to be nice by offering to go to my favorite place, and I'm sure lots of people would appreciate that, but I actually really appreciate if someone who invites me on a date is willing to put in the effort to suggest a plan.

Him: I‚Äôm not too familiar with places but I‚Äôll look around!

Him (one day later): Depending when you‚Äôre free, I was thinking maybe a park walk and tea. As I‚Äôm not too familiar, if I recall, there is a park next to [location]. I‚Äôm sure that they have a cafe and a walk is nice. If not, I‚Äôll keep thinking!

The problem is that he lives on the east side of a major city, and I live in a suburb that is further east (which he knows), but he is suggesting a park that is on the west side. It's about 30 minutes away for him and an hour for me.

I get that he is new to the area, but it's not that hard to google ""cafes between x and y,"" is it? Also, he has some friends here, so he could ask them for suggestions, right? My honest feeling is that I've lost motivation to meet him because he doesn't seem to be able to plan a date. But since he's new to the area, should I just accept his suggestion? Or should I offer a counter suggestion even though I asked him to choose? I'm not sure.

1iwnz4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1iwnz4i/need_advice_i_do_not_feel_comfortable_leaving_my/,Need advice. I do not feel comfortable leaving my elderly grandmother under the care of my aging mother,"TLDR: I have been taking care of my grandma but wish to move out and worry about leaving my grandma in my mothers care. My mom, who lives with her and was her primary caretaker before, has grown a short fuse, become judgmental and rude, and has growing issues with her memory and ability to think clearly. She is hard to talk to about these things and does not want to go to the doctor. What should I do and what are my options?

My (24f) mother (56f) was the main person helping my grandma (80F) grandmother until a few months ago when me and my husband (26m) moved back in with them. We originally moved back in with them under the idea that we would be living with them temporarily until we were able to get our own apartment, but now that we have been here for a few months, I worry that we might not be able to leave when we hoped we would. 

My grandma has mobility issues, needs hearing aids, and cannot see very well. Despite all this, she doesn't need help with a whole lot. I help her make her coffee, meals, set out pills for the week, and act as an extra pair of hands for her (put her pajamas in the bathroom, open her fruit cup, fill up a glass of water etc.) My grandma is perfectly mentally sound and was a nurse when she worked so her medical appointments and her medicines she only needs a little help with since she can't see very well. She has a very good memory and remembers most of her appointments even without being able to check the calendar. She does need help getting to and from appointments and filling out the forms as she cannot read the small text.

Before we moved in my mom was the only one living with her and helping her with some of these things (My grandma only started asking for help with things like making her coffee and breakfast after I moved back in,) but now I worry that she will refuse to care for my grandma in the way she needs when me and my husband move out. My mom struggles with arthritis and a worsening eyesight and most likely other issues but she has a horrible fear of the doctors so does not go unless she feels it is absolutely necessary. She has almost zero patience and for some reason does not seem to believe my grandma needs as much help as she does. It has been more than one occasion where my mom has accused my grandma of purposefully ignoring her when my grandma could not hear her and she often sighs and rolls her eyes when my grandma asks for extra help with something. My mom was not always like this. Yes she didn't like being ignored but she never had this short of a temper or this much of an attitude. She has also become much ruder and judgmental and doesn't even seem to realize shes doing it. Most worryingly, she has been having issues with her memory and ability to think clearly. I swear, on bad says I could ask her if the sky was blue and she would say 'I don't understand.'

my uncle lives about 30 min away and comes over about once a week to help out with things like managing expenses and making sure the house isn't falling down but he and his wife work and have other family members they are helping so he cannot be here more often than that. 

I am an only child and an only grandchild. My mom and dad divorced when I was little (what I'm going to do about my dad as he gets older is a completely different problem for another day) and my moms side of the family is to far away or to elderly themselves for any other relative to help out much. I have looked into home health care for my grandma but do not know what to do about my mom. She quit her job recently and doesn't seem to have any intention of getting a new one, nor do I think she would be able to keep one with how she is now. I have been doing research on if her behavior could be related to early signs of dementia or altimeters, but there is no one else in the family that has it and with my mom refusing to go to the doctor I have no way to confirm if that's the problem or something else. 

I guess I an mainly looking for advice on how to talk to my mom about her behavior/medical issues and what my options are for getting someone to take care of my grandma. My mom and me have never had a very open communication about things and the few times recently when me or my uncle tried to talk to her about important things she either insists there wasn't a problem until we made it a problem or laughs like we were joking. 

Any advice would be helpful, but if anything it felt good to type all this out. Its been nice reading some of the posts on here and seeing things that I can relate too. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read all this.

1iwny9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1iwny9j/chemotherapy_survival_tips_ac_taxol/,Chemotherapy survival tips (AC & Taxol),"I have my final round of chemo this week! This forum was an amazing resource for me when I started chemo so I thought I would pay it forward. 

First some stats: I‚Äôm 42 and was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) last September. I‚Äôm triple positive and the cancer is in both my breast and my lymph nodes. I started chemo in early October. 

I‚Äôm located in BC, Canada. I have three children (5, 7 and 10) 

I had four rounds of AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) every two weeks. I then switched to four rounds of dose-dense Taxol (Paclitaxel and then nab-paclitaxel) with Herceptin every three weeks. 

#*AC*


I‚Äôm not going to lie. AC is a bitch to get through. You might get lucky and have fewer symptoms than me. You might be unlucky and have more. Here‚Äôs what I experienced and how I managed. 

*Nausea*

Right before my infusion, I would take the oral meds at the chemo clinic. I took 8 mg of oral Dexamethasone and Akynzeo. I also had Metoclopramide to take as needed. My chemo days were Tuesday and I found I needed the Metoclipramide until Saturday morning. I ended up taking this every 6 hours to keep the nausea under control rather than waiting until the nausea was bad. 

With the approval of my oncologist, I took edible cannabis to supplement the Metoclopramide. I have a low tolerance to THC so I would cut a pearl edible in half, which was 1 mg THC per dose. This was enough (for me) to help with both the nausea and my appetite. I live in BC where weed use is very common. However, even before it was legalized we had compassionate care clubs where cancer patients could access it. If you‚Äôre going through chemo please consider adding cannabis to your toolkit. It made a huge difference for me. 

I also drew on my experience from my first trimesters of pregnancy and ate small portions of high-protein food frequently. The nausea was always worse when my stomach was empty. Cheese strings were a go-to for me during pregnancy and they worked during chemo as well. 

*Appetite*

For about 5 days after my AC chemo treatment, I would be in a ‚Äúchemo fog‚Äù and did not want to eat.

Small portions eaten frequently worked to reduce my nausea and keep my strength up. 

My rule of thumb is it had to be easy for me to make and provide some kind of nutritional value. 

Frozen smoothies and smoothie pops were easy. Soup worked as well. I lived off a butternut squash lentil one. Yogurt and cheese strings were quick snacks. 

I would try to eat in front of a show to force myself to eat a few bites more. 

My mouth would taste metallic for most of my AC treatment. I didn‚Äôt find a solution for this but my dry mouth drops (see below) would take the taste away for a while. 

*Dry Mouth/ Mouth Sores*

For dry mouth: look for drops containing Xylitol. It increased saliva production.

I didn‚Äôt get mouth sores but I was obsessive about preventing them.

1. Super soft toothbrush run under hot water before brushing
2. Sensitive toothpaste
3. Made at-home rinse after every time I ate or drank something (4 cups water with 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp baking soda)
4. Mouthwash with hydrogen peroxide 3 times a day (Colgate Peroxyl)
5. No acidic foods (citrus, pineapple, fresh tomatoes)
6. No spicy foods
7. No coffee

*Hair & Skin*

I lost my hair. 

I got it cut into a pixie right before I started chemo. My hair started falling out after my second round of chemo. My husband buzzed it to a ¬º length. This was a mistake because my hair was falling out like crazy and the short little bits were crazy itchy. So then we buzzed it all off. 

I wash my scalp with Aveeno baby shampoo. I also use the same stuff (it‚Äôs a shampoo and body wash combo) as a body wash.

Here are some of the products I used on my body:

1. Aveeno calm & restore serum 
2. Aveeno calm & restore cleanser
3. Aveeno Baby daily gentle moisture wash & shampoo
4. Eucerin Aquaphor Body Spray 
5. Vaseline (for my feet)
6. Vanicream (for my face. This stuff is amazing for your dry chemo skin)

*Fatigue*

The fatigue after an AC treatment was crazy! Like couldn‚Äôt climb stairs with exhaustion hard. I did find that at about 5 days post-treatment I started to regain my energy. 

Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. I would take an electrolyte drink the day before treatment and for a couple of days post-treatment. I know some people in the States would go in for IVs a few days after treatment but that wasn‚Äôt an option for me. 

*Bone Pain*

I had a Filgrastim after each AC treatment. For reference, I had Lapelga and an additional treatment of Grastofil when my blood count wasn't rising. 

I found I had more bone pain with the single Lapelga injection when compared to the series of 5 Grastofil injections. I took Claritin which seemed to help. Heating pads also helped. 

#*TAXOL*

Compared to AC, taxol has been way easier. I did have an allergic reaction (lots of fun) and I‚Äôve been switched to a different formulation of Taxol for my last two treatments. 

I‚Äôm not on Lapelga injections with Taxol. 

I haven't had Neuropathy and haven‚Äôt iced during treatment. 

*Bone Pain*

I have what I would consider moderate bone pain after my Taxol treatments. It takes me out for a couple of days and then I just have a residual soreness. My oncologist has offered me something stronger for the pain but what I‚Äôm doing is manageable.

Here‚Äôs what has worked:

Alternating Tylenol and Advil
Heating pads
Edible Cannabis 

That was a much longer post than I intended. However, if you‚Äôre on this forum because you‚Äôve just been diagnosed and are facing chemo, I hope it helps.

1iwnvuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1iwnvuu/i_cant_stop_thinking_of_him/,I can't stop thinking of him.,"I lost my ~19 year old cat this past week. We had him for 17 years. Since I was 5. He declined so quickly. I never thought it would be so soon. I thought I had more time. 

He had lymphoma. Fluid kept filling his abdomen and we had to put him to sleep Thursday.

Every single thing I do reminds me of him.

We'd wake up together. Take our medicine together in the morning. He'd wait by the shower to lick the water off the walls when I was done. He would come upstairs with me to get my coffee in the morning. 

He'd be waiting when I got home from work. He went to bed with me at night. I walk outside and remember him rolling in the grass during the summer. 

Literally every waking moment I was not at work was spent with him. His absence is just so incredibly jarring. I think of him every moment of the day, in every single thing I do. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. No amount of ""remembering the good times"" makes me miss him less. 

I just feel this weight on my chest. This emptiness where he used to be. I don't know how I'm supposed to get through this. He's been there for me through absolutely everything. 

Putting him to sleep was so sudden. I woke up that morning and knew it had to be that day. He was still happy and okay, but his abdomen was completely filled with fluid and hard again and I didn't want him to experience the pain or discomfort I knew was coming. The veterinary staff was incredible as well. He had a whole shredded chicken breast and 4 squeeze up treats before his final moments. It went so well but that didn't make it easier. 

I had Friday and the weekend off to grieve, and I go back to work in the morning. I have no idea how I'm supposed to do it without him. 

I'm supposed to get his ashes back Friday. I don't know if that'll help or make it worse. 

I have two other cats and they don't even seem phased. It's like he never existed in the first place. But I'm just torn up inside. I'm trying to give them all of my energy but they're just so different from him. He was so outgoing and friendly. They're very independent and aloof. I have so much love to give that used to be for him and no place to put it. 

If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. I just can't see any way to move foward. I'm just in limbo, barely getting through the day without him.

1iwnroy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSPI/comments/1iwnroy/wondering_if_baby_has_a_dairy_intolerance/,Wondering if baby has a dairy intolerance,"Baby is 10 weeks old and exclusively breast fed (with one bottle of expressed milk a day) and about two and a half weeks ago she started taking Famotidine due to reflux. She was previously spitting up a lot and was deemed a ‚Äúhappy spitter,‚Äù but over time I started noticing her feedings getting shorter and her starting to cry during feeds, thus we were concerned about her intake (weighed feedings showed she was taking less). This was the main reason we got her on meds as I didn‚Äôt want it to start impacting her gaining weight. Lactation consultant saw her behavior and was also concerned and believed it was reflux.

At first I felt like the meds were beginning to work, but it has been over 2 and a half weeks and she is still having regular crying during her feedings. Some days are better than others. However, I‚Äôm sitting here after another difficult feeding and I started wondering more about diet. I was told it was very rare for babies to have dairy intolerances and that the likelihood of that being the problem was low. I was thinking about my diet the past few days and realized I started drinking coffee again (with milk), ate pasta with dairy, got ice cream for the first time in a while, etc. I‚Äôm wondering if this could have contributed to the past few days being difficult for her.

Symptoms I‚Äôve noticed:

-congestion sounds while she‚Äôs crying after eating
- crying during or after feeds (occurring less since on meds but still happening depending on the day)
- lots of hiccuping, sneezing, coughing
-less spit up, but still happening here and there. (I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs becoming silent reflux)
- back arching after eating and while crying
- maybe mucous in poop? I‚Äôm honestly not really sure what to look for, but I know I haven‚Äôt seen any blood

She doesn‚Äôt seem to have trouble sleeping due to it, or at least when she is sleeping she doesn‚Äôt choke or cry as I have read other parents have experienced. 

I feel so burnt out from not being able to help her feel better. I‚Äôm considering cutting out dairy but was also told it would take 2 weeks to see a difference if I did. Just looking for thoughts and if anyone else experienced these symptoms with their baby too.",1,1740353267.0,MSPI,6,1.0,False

The first 2 batches I followed a Brambleberry kit just to get comfortable with soapmaking and lye.  I also did a few batches after following their recipes all which turned out perfectly.  

The past batch I used a soap calculator to create my own recipe and wanted to try something without palm oil. I've attached the photo of the recipe.  I also added 2 tsp of sodium lactate in the lye water and 2 tablespoons of ground coffee and 30 ml of coconut fragrance oil at a thin trace.  I batched somewhere around  93-98 degrees.  It's been 5 days and it's still very soft on the bottom. I still unmolded anyway.  I noticed this recipe asked for a higher water amount than the Brambleberry kits as the beginner setting on the soap calc is 38%.  I'm assuming this is too high?   I know higher olive oil results in a much longer cure time also.  What can I do to perfect this recipe for next time?  Thanks so much in advance.",1,1740352825.0,soapmaking,3,1.0,False
1iwnlsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/theloise/comments/1iwnlsf/jobs_for_eloise/,Jobs For Eloise,"One of my dream scenarios for Eloise is for her and Theo to elope and settle down somewhere away from the ton, at least for a while (before the family catches up with her). One of my preferred places for them to settle down is Manchester, which has long been associated with radical, left wing politics, and The Guardian (one of Britain's most popular left wing papers) was originally the Manchester Guardian. Because Eloise earning her own money would be everything (and combined with Theo's wages would allow for a ""charwoman"" to come in and do cooking and cleaning for them, instead of El being a housewife) I've been thinking about what sort of historically accurate jobs Eloise could have (while also campaigning for women/worker's rights).

Work in a Coffee House: Coffee houses were at the time known for being places for people to gather for intellectual, philosophical, scientific and political discussions. I picture Eloise getting a job in a coffee house early on, when she is looking for any sort of work, and attracted to the coffee houses for the diverse groups of people and intellectual atmosphere. It could be a stop gap job for Eloise, while she looks for something else, and something that helps her develop her ideas and mix with other people. Or, in time, Eloise and Theo could open their own coffee house, with the intent of hosting political and intellectual groups. 

Circulating Library: Regency eras, circulating libraries were very popular, and people used them to read gothic romances and novels. Circulating libraries had a bit of controversy about them, women, including young women, could take out subscriptions and read all sorts of ""wicked things"". Eloise working for, perhaps in time running, a circulating library would not only be profitable and period appropriate venture for Eloise, and one that would interest her personally, she might also take delight in ""corrupting"" young women. Eloise being an educated and well read lady, but one masquerading as someone not particularly privileged (middle-class, educated, perhaps raised to teach?) would probably be the sort of person someone running a circulating library would hire, and Eloise might thrive having her own library to run if she set up her own/bought out her employer's business. 

Open a printing press with Theo: Women often helped with family businesses. Eloise and Theo working together to run their own progressive printing press would be historically accurate, allow Eloise and Theo to dedicate themselves to spreading their beliefs and politics, and would also be pretty romantic. They could even set up Bridgerton's version of the Manchester Guardian.",7,1740352817.0,theloise,1,1.0,False

He is currently 83 years old, but sometimes I think he is physically healthier than us, who are 30. He carries water from the yardwell (even tho we have water at home) on a daily basis. 

His illness is probably on the more severe stages, besides physical. He repeats himself every 5-10 minutes. He eats until all food is gone, and this also drove me absolutely mad at first (not at him, I was just so sad to find out the thing I bought for me was gone). We managed to install a secret second fridge at the office that he usually forgets (sometimes he remembers it‚Äôs there and goes to look for food over there and ends up eating my things- I‚Äôm in a special diet with expensive food products due to health condition-can not afford to buy this things but I make an effort and him consuming them is a disaster for my health). 

If there‚Äôs an item that‚Äôs empty (usually because of him) he would just not let it go. He asks every 5 minutes: where‚Äôs the bread? Are you buying bread? Is there bread in the house? 
He is not hungry, it‚Äôs not possible. No human could be hungry. He eats a bag of bread in a day, that‚Äôs 12 pieces!! 
If there‚Äôs alcohol, now he also drinks it. That man did not drink alcohol in his whole life. 

If he finds my bfs wallet, he takes whatever money it‚Äôs there and goes to the store to buy bread and juice. Last year, when he was walking by the park, a dog barked at him and he fell on his knee. He had a small fracture of his femur. It was not enough to have a cast installed, I prayed to the doctor to do it anyways because if he didn‚Äôt, he would make it worse. And yes it happened. While laying in bed he would usually forget it was hurting and he would just try to sit AND stand crying in pain saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this hurts I was fine this morning‚Äù. Ofc he was not, this lasted for weeks until it healed. 

He stop remembering to shower. It took a few days for us to notice he did not remember that. Now we run the shower and tell him ‚Äúoh your showers is ready, you said you‚Äôre gonna showers now‚Äù. Because if we tell him to shower, plainly, he‚Äôd get mad or offended. 

My bf had to get him off the internet years ago because he would fall from every scam. He still thinks he has 2 billions in a Canadian Royal Bank. Cleaning one of the rooms I found prints from 2012 from every scam site you can imagine saying ‚Äúgive us 2 dollars and we will send you your family inheritance from Tuvalu‚Äù. 

He started presenting symptoms in 2010. 

The biohazard part is that I think he doesn‚Äôt wash his hands. We painted the kitchen on June last year‚Ä¶ he has damaged said paint to the point it is black where he usually touches (near the fridge). And when I say damage I mean the paint is so frail, that within a day or two after cleaning it, it becomes black again. 

He also spits and blows his nose everywhere all day. It revolts my stomach. He spits through the window on my plants, on the kitchen sink, on the patio, on the streets, from his bed to the patio. 

I try to clean, but ultimately I‚Äôm very tired of cleaning my own house and working all the time. My boyfriend cleans too, although he is not very thorough or diligent for my standards. I like spotless spaces I can‚Äôt even tolerate shoes on the house. 

The dad was once was a clean man. He tries to do the dishes (not up to my standards, he does it without washing the sponge), but if he finds leftovers, he throws them in a corner in the patio and it makes a black green mold grow. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many times we clean it and tell him not to do it. The first time, a water pressure pump was needed because it was a gross black mold. 

The stovetop‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt tell you. Only this: it took steel brushes and lots of elbow grease to clean. He cooks and doesn‚Äôt clean it one bit. 

Sometimes I am working at the office and he comes to talk (usually ask if there‚Äôs food) and I‚Äôm on important calls. He has taken off the signs of the door saying not to enter. 

He is constantly thinking we will get robbed so he carries all the food bags he can to his room. Coffee bag, sugar, rice, eggs. If we don‚Äôt check daily, he would let rotten eggs sit on his room, probably for ever. 

Any thing we leave on tables in the living room he takes. Keys, wallets, all is a ‚Äúpray of thieves‚Äù. We had to buy AirTags for the items because he also doesn‚Äôt remember taking them, of course. And he hides them under whatever else he finds first. 

My boyfriend wants to marry and have kids before his dad dies‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd be daaaammed if I brought a kid tho that house. It would probably die of sepsis. 

I love my boyfriend and his dad is a candid good person‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt want to live there. It‚Äôs very unfortunate but I see his dad as a burden to someone who cares a lot about cleanliness like me. And bringing a child to that situation would mean death to me. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for a baby to live like that. 

His dad is European, and in my opinion-that I have not shared with my bf- we should take him there and maybe someone can help us there, because I don‚Äôt think my boyfriend is even qualified to do it, one of us will end up with a stomach bug one day. 

My bf says that once he finishes college, he‚Äôll call family members to get help from them, but I don‚Äôt think they will do anything, specially because they live in different countries and also never cared to call once per year, for more than 10 years. We are alone in this.

I didn't have any particular bias toward them, I just found most of them to be sweet and mild on the dry-down, sort of like flavored coffee creamer. But recently, on a whim, I ordered and tried two different samples and I love them for entirely different reasons.

*Vanilj* by Maya Njie is the yang in my title. It is a warm, spicy vanilla with cardamom and while the perfumer's description says ""bourbon,"" I'll say I never really understood the description ""boozy"" until this fragrance, which smells like really good dark rum to me. The base is patchouli and cedar. The patchouli has zero hippie vibe here. And, while this fragrance is not overtly gourmand, it serves up memories of a bundt cake my mother used to make that was soaked with rum... if I was eating it in a wood-paneled cabin on the edge of a forest. I find this to be a super-cozy fragrance and I've been wearing it off and on through the cold weather. I ordered a travel size of this. I find it layers well with warm skin scents.

*Sel-Vanille* by Maison Tahit√© is my yin in the title. It is a soft aquatic vanilla that isn't overly sweet and feels fresh and not at all gourmand to me. It breaks all the vanilla stereotypes. There is a tiny bit of jasmine floating on the sea air. The salt and aquatic notes are not particularly crisp. If your best friend's older sister liked to swim in the ocean and then use vanilla lotion after her shower, this is what she would smell like. I really enjoyed it and may purchase a full size.

Both of these fragrances have decent staying power. I could still smell *Sel-Vanille* on my arm the morning after I tested it. ",1,1740352432.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

I honestly don‚Äôt know whose palms are getting greased to keep this product from being exposed but if it‚Äôs making money then they just say ‚Äú it‚Äôs not FDA approved‚Äù because vitamins aren‚Äôt FDA approved. But Thrive has a lot more than just vitamins, and many of the weight loss supplements have been studied enough to know that they‚Äôre not safe for long term use and occasionally, they are downright harmful. 

I‚Äôm not even talking about whether it‚Äôs safe for pregnant women because it isn‚Äôt. The company itself doesn‚Äôt market their patches to pregnant women, and SW was always lying about it being ‚ÄúDoctor approved‚Äù for pregnancy. I‚Äôm just talking about adult men and women who throw caution to the wind in order to get hooked on this stuff.  But things tend to go wrong A LOT. And when people end up with rashes that won‚Äôt go away, or their heart rate is suddenly elevated beyond the normal range, what happens? 

The company asserts that they are innocent of any wrongdoing because THEY say that the product is just like a vitamin, so it‚Äôs not FDA approved and it affects everyone differently  But they don‚Äôt educate their promoters about the ingredients in Thrive. I know more about what is in Thrive than a promoter who will try to sell it to you! They just make crap up and work off their script that insists that it‚Äôs ‚Äúall natural‚Äù so that must mean it‚Äôs all good (and even that‚Äôs a fallacy). 

Le Vel‚Äôs  promoters tell prospective buyers to emphasize ‚Äúhow Thrive makes you feel‚Äù rather than dwelling on what‚Äôs actually in it, or WHY it makes you feel ‚Äúhigh‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶People sporting color coordinated patches to go with the seasons have the equivalent of a caffeine drip attached to their body with the false promise that there‚Äôs no caffeine in it! 

They get away with saying that because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnon synthetic caffeine‚Äù but that‚Äôs still caffeine. What the hell do people think is in tea leaves or green coffee beans?  For example, one of the core ingredients in Thrive is Guarana. Guarana is a caffeinated plant, known for its stimulating properties. The seeds are about the size of a coffee bean and contain roughly four times the amount of caffeine.¬†So, how can any of these promoters tell anyone that Thrive has ‚Äúno caffeine‚Äù in good conscience? 

Because Le Vel doesn‚Äôt care to educate promoters or customers about the ingredients  in their products, there are plenty of complaints registered from people who ended up in the hospital because some ‚Äú super excited‚Äù promoter insisted that it was perfectly safe and perfectly healthy!

And the other thing is-if someone gets a ‚Äúfree‚Äù sample -and has problems? Then they‚Äôre shit out of luck! Because the company didn‚Äôt sell it to them! They have no record of their order. And the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù took it willing and the independent contractor that told them that it was perfectly fine isn‚Äôt technically one of their employees. Le Vel has got it all figured out so they won‚Äôt be liable. 

The people who get into this racket are rarely wealthy people, whereas the people who get suckered into letting a promoter ‚Äúhelp them‚Äù and accept free samples rarely have the kind of bucks to take on a very protected entity like Le Vel. I‚Äôm also convinced that Le Vel has been paying SOMEONE off in order to stay in business. 

And just think about how both Chris & SW would often double up on those patches! That‚Äôs enough to put anyone with high blood pressure, or high cholesterol into an early grave. Of the smartest things that I ever heard Frank Senior say was that he wouldn‚Äôt take Thrive because he was too afraid of having a heart attack! 

Here are a few reviews from Sitejabber. It has a 1.9 star average on this particular site, but only because of all of the promoters who have given it 5 stars to balance out the negative reviews. Any site that has given Thrive a mostly positive rating or great reviews is fixed. Someone is undoubtedly paying someone else off.

1iwnafb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwnafb/he_shook_my_hand/,He shook my hand,"I met death yesterday. He shook my hand.¬†

I haven‚Äôt slept much. I hear him everywhere, see him when I shut my eyes. I can feel him in the house, even though he can't be. I've checked everywhere. With the sun going down, I‚Äôm running out of time. I don‚Äôt know what I hope to get out of writing this; part of me hopes someone will know what to do, how to take it back. Maybe someone will have an idea how to buy more time so I can figure that out. Maybe I just want someone to know what happened to me.

I need to start over. Go back to this morning, when it started. Could be there‚Äôs something I missed.¬†

The phone ringing woke me up. Don‚Äôt know the exact time, but I remember the sky outside was still tinted red and orange, so it can‚Äôt have been much past sunrise. I silenced it the first time, thought it was my alarm. It started back up before I‚Äôd even sat the phone down.

I should‚Äôve never answered. It‚Äôs not Ellie‚Äôs fault, of course, but she kicked this whole thing into gear. ‚ÄúSorry to bother you. It‚Äôs just, I‚Äôm freezing, Alan. I think my heater‚Äôs out. Would you mind coming by, taking a look before I call somebody? Can‚Äôt afford to waste the money.‚Äù¬†

Ellie lives about a half mile down the road; we live pretty far from town, and given she‚Äôs getting up there in age, I try to keep an eye on her. More than that, she‚Äôs stubborn as a mule, too proud to take handouts; I‚Äôve known her twenty years, and I can count on one hand the number of times she‚Äôs come right out and asked for help. I was still rubbing sleep out of my eyes, but I could hear the shiver in her voice. She spoke fast, urgent. ‚ÄúBe happy to. How soon you need me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no rush,‚Äù she said. Ellie wasn‚Äôt even trying to hide the lie in those words.

‚ÄúAlright, well, let me get dressed, get some coffee in me, and I‚Äôll head right over.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can make coffee for you here.‚Äù The words came out in one reactionary clump. ‚ÄúI mean, I usually have some myself anyway, so it‚Äôs not a problem. Least I can do.‚Äù¬†

I started to ask if everything was okay when the line went dead.

When I got there, she was standing on the front porch, wringing her hands together. I could see the sweat speckling her forehead from the car, her skin tinged red. She looked more like she‚Äôd just run a marathon than was worried about the cold. She came out to meet me, kept glancing down the drive behind me; mud tugged at her bare feet and she hardly seemed to notice. When she got to the car, she pulled the door open, practically pulled me out of it. ‚ÄúThanks for coming, Alan. I swear, that thing is always on the fritz.‚Äù Her hands burned against my skin.¬†

I should have called an ambulance right then ‚Äî they might have sent the cops, too. Not sure it would have mattered much, after everything that‚Äôs happened, but still.¬†

As soon as we were in the door, she slammed it shut, threw the deadbolt. The inside of her cabin was a little chilly, but not nearly so cold she would have called about it. What stood out more than the cold was the dark. Like Ellie wanted the whole place in shadows, tracked down every way something could push them back and squashed it out. Every curtain pulled shut, all the lamps off, and as my eyes adjusted I could see all the power cord for the television pulled from the wall. ‚ÄúSay, Ellie, you mind if I turn the light on?‚Äù

Her eyes snapped over to me, begged me not to touch it. I hadn‚Äôt even heard her move over to the window; a thin line of sunlight carved a column across her face, lit one beady and wild eye as she peeked through the curtains. I think she realized how she looked, blinked it away. ‚ÄúI mean, no, there‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the power‚Äôs out. I guess the heater might have knocked it out, or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said. I believed it then about as much as you probably do now. ‚ÄúWell, you got a flashlight or something, even a candle?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt hear me, just kept staring out the window at the driveway. Her hand sent a shudder through the whole curtain, and the red had run out of her face.¬†

‚ÄúEllie, is everything alright?‚Äù When she still ignored me, I raised my voice a bit. I feel bad, yelling at a woman like that, but the hairs on my neck were starting to stand, and I could feel my heart starting to pick up the pace. That kind of fear I could see in her, it‚Äôs contagious. ‚ÄúEllie!‚Äù

That was enough to get her to flinch, at least. ‚ÄúSorry, sorry, I just‚Ä¶ the power going out, it‚Äôs got me a little on edge, is all. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù¬†

I watched her for a moment, trying to gauge how much to push just yet. The way she was shaking, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to call her a liar. ‚ÄúWell, you know where the breaker box is?‚Äù

She nodded, somehow peeled herself away from that window. When the curtain shut, the world went dark again. I started to take my phone from my pocket, but Ellie must have expected it, put a stern and trembling hand on mine to stop me.¬†

I followed Ellie back into the house by sound alone. My knee hit the corner of the table, and the worry of being heard by something was worse than the pain, somehow. She led me back to a closet, opened it slow for me, stopping any time the door creaked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in here. Just be quiet.‚Äù¬†

I nodded, not that she could see me, and I heard her shuffle off somewhere into the darkness.¬†

Running my fingers over the breakers, I tried to piece together what might be happening. Was she as sick as she looked?¬† Every now and then I could hear Ellie moving around in the house, but it seemed to shift, bouncing from room to room without the sound of her walking between them.¬†

The knock at the door kicked me out of it. I swear, standing there in that dark, they sounded like a bell ringing at first. Not a doorbell, but one of those big heavy church bells. I leaned back, could see light peeking through the seam of the door, see the two patches of dark where shadow blocked out the sun.¬†

I waited for Ellie to go and answer, strained to find her in the dark. The only thing I found was another three steady knocks.

I don‚Äôt know why I went to the door. I guess I thought whatever was on the other side, it might be the real reason Ellie called me. If I could just get it to go away, I could wake up from this nightmare and go home, go about my day.

The man on the other side looked at me as soon as the door opened. Most of what I remember is vague: neat black hair, average height. I remember his cheeks sucked inward into his skull, the wrinkles carving crevices over his skin, and the way his clothes seemed to fall over him like there was nothing inside but bone. His eyes, though. I see them when I shut my eyes. Bloodshot, his pupils like burning coal in the light and dark mineshafts in the shadow. I never understood the phrase ‚Äúif looks could kill‚Äù before then, but those eyes knew nothing else. Behind him, a panel vans sat on the dirt driveway, the body painted so dark a black that it seemed to suck the light out of the air. Worse, it sat right where the trees gave way, blocking my car in.

‚ÄúAfternoon,‚Äù the man said, doing his best to fill cold words with warmth. His voice sounded like his lungs were filled with gravel, and his smile seemed like pins held it in place. ‚ÄúAlan, I take it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYessir.‚Äù Felt like the word was pulled out of me more than I spoke it. I held my hand out, hoping that it might diffuse whatever this was. ‚ÄúDo I know you? Apologies if we‚Äôve met before, must be slipping my mind.‚Äù

He glanced down at the hand, ignored it. Wind whipped a chill through the trees, cold enough that it sent a shiver down my spine, and the man swayed to one side like he might fall over, all the while his expectant eyes staring through me.

‚ÄúAlright, then. There something I can help you with?‚Äù

‚ÄúI certainly hope so. I‚Äôm looking for Eleanor.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot here,‚Äù I said fast, regretted faster. ‚ÄúI can let her know you stopped by, if you like.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt wait. Busy schedule these days.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn a Saturday?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, every day. If I could just speak with her, I‚Äôll be out of your hair.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said,‚Äù I shrugged, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

I could see in the twitch of his smile he didn‚Äôt believe me. ‚ÄúAlan, it is in your best interest to send Eleanor to the door.‚Äù

I thought of that old woman, all the times she‚Äôd brought me dinner out of the blue or sent care packages any time I was sick. Salt of the earth, that woman. If this man scared her so bad, I couldn‚Äôt send her out here. ‚ÄúWish I could. Guess you‚Äôll just have to rearrange your schedule a bit.‚Äù

He stared so long, those eyes never shifting, that faint smile never fading, his chest never drawing breath, that I thought he‚Äôd died standing up. With a click of the tongue, he cocked his head to the side. ‚ÄúYou sure you want that?‚Äù

I could hear a voice screaming at me in the back of my head, telling me to just stand aside, let whatever happened happen. I could just go back to my car, wait for this to play out, for this man to get back in his car and leave so I could drive away like I was never there. If the van hadn‚Äôt blocked the way out, I would have, truth be told. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see much other option.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. If you insist.‚Äù It was his turn to hold a hand out. It hovered too close to my chest, right about my heart, spindly fingers grazing the fabric.¬†

I shook it. I could feel every bone in his grip, and ice ran up my arm. He held on too long, refusing to let me pull away, barely even seemed to be trying to hold my hand in place, to keep my gaze locked on his. When he let go, I took a step back, thought about slamming the door in his face like it would have made any difference then. He just kept smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in touch.‚Äù

Then he turned, walked back out to his car. Thinking back, I don‚Äôt think his feet crunched on the dirt. If they did, I was too happy seeing the back of him, too happy having those eyes off of me to notice. The van sputtered to life, drove away at a crawl, the man at the wheel dragging the departure out.¬†

When the van receded out of sight, I turned around. Light coming through the door cut a path through the dark, and I could see Ellie standing at the edge of it, afraid to step too far forward like the sun might burn.

‚ÄúThank you, Alan.‚Äù¬†

I nodded, not sure what else to do. What do you say after something like that? ‚ÄúYou want me to wait with you for the power?‚Äù *To see if he comes back*.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I could see the shadow take a slow step back. ‚ÄúOh. The power. Right. No, that‚Äôs okay. Someone will be out eventually. You should‚Ä¶ you should go. Don‚Äôt want to keep you. I know your schedule is full.‚Äù¬†

I opened my mouth to say something, anything, but she was already shuffling off into the dark, disappearing into one of the rooms. I heard a door swing shut, heard the click of the latch then the click of the lock. I thought about walking down there, knocking on the door, demanding an answer ‚Äî probably should have ‚Äî but I know a sign to leave when I see one. So I left.¬†

I was about halfway home when I saw it in the rearview mirror. The van was following me. It was far enough back that the hills hid it every now and then, the trees masking its pursuit, but it was there, no mistaking it. I sped up, hoping it was a coincidence and it had just gotten turned around, knowing it wasn‚Äôt. It followed me all the way to my house, even pulled into my driveway as I stepped inside.¬†

I watched it out the window for a long while. No point hiding, the man had watched me walk in the front door. The windshield was so dark, I couldn‚Äôt see him, but I could feel those eyes on me again, burning right through me. After a few minutes, he left.

It was dark before I trusted enough to leave that window, even for a moment. My stomach did me in, I think; I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, and it finally made enough noise that I had to do something about it. I threw a pizza in the oven, went back to my post, left to throw a few pieces on a plate, went back to the window. I sat at that window until the sun was a distant memory and the trees stayed visible even when I blinked, their imprint burned into my sight. That van never came back. I started to wonder if I was overreacting, if it was just a weird guy who bothered Ellie every now and then. I tried calling her six or seven times throughout the night; she never answered. She was seeing the calls, though. They kept ringing once, maybe twice, before the voicemail clicked in.¬†

I don‚Äôt know when I fell asleep. Knocking woke me up, three heavy thumps stabbed through my chest. When I didn‚Äôt move, fear holding me to the spot, the knocks came again. I knew they would. I still didn‚Äôt move, sat in the dark, hoped beyond hope I hadn‚Äôt been seen through the window. The front door was the only thing keeping me away from him now. If I could have melted into the chair, become nothing, maybe he would have left. He‚Äôs a busy man, after all.

A soft click shattered the silence, and the doorknob started to turn. It turned all the way, pressed against the deadbolt with a clack, relaxed. And I thought it was over. I thought I was safe. I thought I would be okay right up until I heard a quiet pop, the whisper of window sliding open somewhere in the house.

I ran upstairs. I don‚Äôt know where the sound came from, but it couldn‚Äôt be up there, right? I got to the bathroom ‚Äî there‚Äôs no window in there ‚Äî and shut the door as quietly as it would allow. I leaned against it, held it shut, wedged my feet against the bathtub if I needed to push back harder. When I reached into my pocket, hoping to call the police, I found it empty.

I didn‚Äôt hear his footsteps earlier, but I heard them now. The faint tap on hardwood like a heartbeat as he climbed the steps, the slow stride down the hall stopping at each door. I could feel his eyes sweeping over the dark, searching. The house ran cold, and there was a smell to him. Only thing I can think of like it was back in college when our fridge died while we were out of town, sat like that for three weeks. It wasn‚Äôt the smell when we first got back, the one that turned our stomachs inside out when we first got home that I smelled on him; it was the smell that stained that fridge, the kind that you can‚Äôt wash off, the kind that reminds you of mold and rot and infection as long as you live.¬†

I heard the feet stop behind me, hovering outside the bathroom door. I had never thought about what the door was made of, but it seemed suddenly so important. The doorknob turned left, right, the cold metal brushing against my hair.¬†

Then it stopped. The weight behind me loomed, and I heard something faint shift, lower down to me, press against the other side of the door. 

He whispered. He might have been in the room with me for how loud the words came. I felt his frigid breath on my skin, heard the hiss under each syllable, heard the rocks in his gut rolling around with the effort.

‚ÄúWe had a deal, Alan. Tomorrow‚Äôs going to be worse. And it‚Äôll keep getting worse until we‚Äôre done. I have a schedule to keep.‚Äù

And then he left. Turned, walked back down the hall, down the stairs. I even heard the window shut. The van coughed awake, idled in the yard for too long, waiting to see if I would come out. I didn‚Äôt move until I heard it roll away and out of earshot.

I ran downstairs, found my phone. I kept my eyes off the thick, muddy footprints on the floor while I called the police. They were there in fifteen minutes, found me huddled back in the bathroom. It took two of them speaking to coax me out. Outside, lights cast the forest into flashing hues of red and blue. I scanned them the entire time we spoke, felt eyes watching me from the trees. I told the two officers what happened, and they let me sit in their car while one searched the house.¬†

When he came back out, he looked like he had good news. Even I thought it was at first. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

The cop grinned. ‚ÄúYes, sir. We‚Äôre sure. Happy to walk through again with you if you'd like to see for yourself. No sign anyone was in there in the first place.‚Äù¬†

I blinked. ‚ÄúNo sign? What about the footprints?‚Äù¬†

The cop blinked twice, not understanding. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see any. Where were they?‚Äù He handled my panic well enough, even went back inside to check for them. Still nothing. They took a description of the man, at least, and then they left.¬†

The footprints are gone. Like they were never there. Maybe I imagined them. Maybe I imagined all of this, just one long bad dream. I stayed up all night, still haven‚Äôt slept. Outside the sun is setting, and even now I feel like someone's lurking in the trees, waiting for me to look away. I‚Äôve checked all the locks, made sure my phone and computer are in the bathroom, even some food. I ordered some cameras, but they won‚Äôt be here until tomorrow. Called Ellie a few dozen times, and still no answer. I would have driven over there, but she won't be home. Not if she's as smart as I think she is. And now, if for nothing else than to try and pass the time, I‚Äôm writing this. I have to do something. I‚Äôm praying someone has an answer, but I‚Äôm guessing those prayers will go unanswered too.¬†",7,1740351929.0,nosleep,1,0.9,False

Method: Roast 4 batches of 375g using similar heat parameters to follow RoR, drop each consecutive batch at 5F higher than the last starting with FC + 5F and ending with FC + 20F. Record weight and color. The goal is that the only variable changing should be drop temp. I started with F50 and P80 for each roast. I didn't touch fan and just dropped heat. With the majority of the roasting hypothetically being done by FIR in this machine, and the bulb's ability to almost instantaneously change the RoR, I'm not convinced the fan is worth messing with and am for now just viewing it as a way to vent smoke. 

The only downside is the beans I used were some unknown junk beans from Captain's Coffee for $3.50 a lb, so I can't do any real taste testing, WHICH IS ALWAYS THE ULTIMATE decider. Data helps us, but taste is qualitative - I've had roasts that looked perfect on a graph that tasted like shit and vice versa. 

You may notice the FC + 20F FC temp is a bit of an outlier, but the FC time and drop time line up well. The ambient temp was rapidly falling outside by the last roast and my shed is poorly insulated. I had a propane heater on the workbench (fire hazard anyone?) but it may not have been enough, that's my only guess to the variation. 

Color analysis was unfortunately not done with a digital tool (my DIY one is currently out on loan) but I've gotten pretty good at using the Sweet Maria's card. When I get mine back I may do it again and update if necessary. 

Data:  https://imgur.com/a/hEQiLQc

I should note that in the raw data and the BT in Artisan, I have added 25F to the SW probe temp, assuming that FC happens around 395F internal bean temp and I have been getting FC at 370F on the SW probe temp every time. I am really surprised by how consistently FC happens right at 395F in this machine regardless of batch size and origin, it must be due to the uniformity of internal bean temp from FIR penetration. 

Now that I have a decent baseline, my next experiment is to use some drinkable beans, do 4 batches and drop around FC + 7F (\~City roast) but extend overall roast time 30 seconds each roast. Then cup and see if I can tell them apart and which I prefer. I will of course report back. 

I am going to taste test these junk beans for the hell of it, they look like they could be all the same SA origin. If they are at least drinkable I'll probably make cold brew out of them.",6,1740351916.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Normally, we have a good routine: I wake up first, make coffee, and she wakes up to a nice hot cup. Recently, though, she started getting really particular about how she wants it done. She insists on using this super specific method: measure the grounds to the exact gram, pre-warm the mug in the microwave for 30 seconds, add the milk at a certain temperature, and on and on.

At first, I tried to oblige because hey, if she loves coffee that much, I want to make it nice for her. But it got to a point where every time I handed her a cup, she'd grill me: ***‚ÄúDid you weigh the grounds first?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you warm the mug?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this whole milk or 2%?‚Äù*** If anything was off, even by a tiny bit, she'd sigh and say it wasn't as good as ‚Äúthe right way.‚Äù One morning, she literally took the mug from me, dumped it down the sink, and started the process herself‚Äîwhile ranting that I *never* do it the right way.

I got frustrated and told her, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be this picky, just make your own coffee. I‚Äôm done making something only to be told how it‚Äôs ‚Äòwrong‚Äô every time.‚Äù She got upset and said I was overreacting, that she just wants her coffee a certain way, and that I should respect her preferences. I argued that I *was* respecting her preference‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt appreciate the constant criticism or micromanaging. She accused me of being lazy and unaccommodating.

Now, I‚Äôm feeling guilty because I do want her to enjoy her morning coffee, but I‚Äôm also tired of feeling like I‚Äôm a barista under constant scrutiny. AITA for telling her she can just handle it herself until she stops micromanaging me?

I started this as a little experiment, and now it‚Äôs my full-time job, bringing in a steady $4,500/month (some months even more). Here‚Äôs how it happened, and how you can do the same.

What is Amazon Merch?
Amazon Merch is a free print-on-demand program where you upload designs, and Amazon prints and ships T-shirts, hoodies, and other products for you. You get a cut of every sale, and the best part? No upfront cost for inventory.

Here‚Äôs the process:

Apply for Amazon Merch (takes a few weeks for approval).
But before you do so, here are some secrets that I know people paid for to get accepted:
Amazon LOVES a good portfolio of desginers, so the secret to get accepted is to show them one. But since this is your first experience with POD I reckon that you don't have a portfolio or a website ... So let's make one!
Follow these steps : Go to Spreadshirt and open an account, Add as much designs and make you have a variety of items at the store front, not just t-shirts. Make the designs original, but STAY AWAY from trademark. After that, make sure that your profile is neat and clean with all necessary information. Then when you want to apply to Amazon, make sure that you add that you are an already a designer with a successful store ( link your Spreadshirt account ) and say that you want to reach more audience worldwide. This will increase your chances to get accepted drastically.
After your approval, Create simple designs (text-based or graphic).
Upload them to Amazon and choose products to sell.
Set your price as low as possible to get more sales and tier-up faster (Amazon pays you a royalty per sale, but don't focus on profit until u reach tier 50).
Learn how to do Market research, there are an abundance of ways to do so.
Amazon handles printing, shipping, and customer service.
How I Accidentally Built a Full-Time Business:
I started MBA with zero design experience. I had $100, which I spent on Canva Pro and a few Fiverr gigs for design ideas. My first uploads? Basic text-based shirts like:
‚ÄúIntrovert but willing to discuss coffee‚Äù
‚ÄúFuture Millionaire‚Äù
‚ÄúSarcasm Loading...‚Äù

For the first two months, I made maybe $50 total‚Äîpretty disappointing. But I didn‚Äôt quit. I started using Pinterest & TikTok to promote my designs, found trending niches, and uploaded new designs daily.

Month 3? I crossed $500. Month 6? $2,000. By year one, I was doing $4,500/month, and I quit my job. Now, my designs sell every day, and I don‚Äôt touch inventory or deal with customers.

How You Can Start (Even as a Teen)
Even if you‚Äôre under 18, you can use a parent‚Äôs Amazon account to sign up and split profits with them. 

Here‚Äôs what you need:
Basic design skills like Canva Pro or free design tools ( if you want to join a shared Canva Pro for a budget-friendly price that'll last you for years, inbox me your email to add you, all your designs are secure and private )
A list of trending topics (holidays, memes, hobbies, etc...) there plenty of websites that provide evergreen niche ideas.
Patience is key, it takes time for designs to gain traction, unless you have an already interested audience to share it with.

Tips to Make Real Money:
Upload consistently: Amazon favors active accounts. My friend made the mistake of opening a MBA account and left it, so it got closed after couple of months.
Go for evergreen niches (things people buy year-round).
Use SEO-friendly titles & descriptions (ex: ‚ÄúFunny Coffee Lover T-Shirt‚Äù).
Leverage Pinterest & TikTok for extra traffic.
Reinvest earnings into better designs or ads.

Amazon Merch is a low-risk, high-reward hustle, and I wish I had started sooner. If you‚Äôre thinking about it, just start. You‚Äôll learn as you go.",19,1740351736.0,sidehustle,3,1.0,False

1iwn03p,https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/1iwn03p/twilight_of_manual_typewriters_in_the_newsroom/,Twilight of Manual Typewriters in the Newsroom,"This subreddit has rekindled a long-dormant interest of mine in typewriters, particularly manual office machines. One of my first jobs out of college, in 1981, was as a Desk Assistant on the CBS Radio News Assignment Desk in New York. It was an entry-level position at the bottom of the newsroom hierarchy, but it gave me a front-row seat to breaking news and sparked my interest in typewriters.

At that time, radio news was almost entirely analog. News primarily arrived at the network through three main channels. First, CBS subscribed to all major wire services (AP, UPI, Reuters, and others), receiving their general news feeds along with specialized feeds for radio, business, sports, and more. These services transmitted news via dedicated lines to teletype machines, which continuously clattered out stories on rolls of three-part carbonless paper. My job was to monitor these machines for breaking news, tear off copies, and distribute them to writers, editors, producers, and on-air correspondents.

News also came in through landlines, with reporters and affiliates worldwide calling in stories that were recorded on large Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorders. Editing was done manually‚Äîusing razor blades and splicing tape‚Äîto prepare a polished story for broadcast. Lastly, early editions of major newspapers arrived at about 9:30 p.m. each night, providing additional sources for stories and details on breaking news.

The writing process flowed from writers to editors to on-air radio anchors. Some correspondents wrote their own copy, while others worked with writers. Every script was drafted on four-part carbon books, ensuring copies went to the studio, control room, editors, and other key personnel. My job was to distribute these scripts quickly and accurately before the hourly news ‚Äúsounder‚Äù signaled that we were live.

All copy was typed on manual typewriters, and each newsroom member had a preferred machine. On overnight shifts, I often had to redistribute typewriters to their proper places. Since I had a bit of mechanical aptitude, I also became the unofficial typewriter troubleshooter. Most issues stemmed from misthreaded ribbons, jammed keys, or other minor mechanical hiccups.

Through this experience, I learned which manual typewriters were the preferred tools of the correspondents and how they liked them set up. There was also an unspoken hierarchy of typewriters that dictated who used which machines.

**Assignment and Copy Editors**

The editors‚Äô desks each had ancient Royal HH typewriters, their platens so worn that grooves had formed where the typebars struck. The Assignment Editor‚Äôs machine was used to maintain a running log‚Äîtyped onto rolls of teletype paper‚Äîof all newsroom activities, including calls, bulletins, and pending stories. Throughout my shift, people from across the organization, including television correspondents and executives, would stop by to scroll through this log, checking the latest developments.

These Royal HH typewriters sat at the top of the newsroom hierarchy. Though old and heavily used, they were highly respected for their reliability and functionality. Writers especially appreciated their ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù typing action, even those who relied on a two-fingered typing method.

**Correspondents**

Four correspondent desks were each equipped with relatively new Olympia SG-3 typewriters, featuring a paper injection function. These were the best-maintained typewriters in the newsroom and were highly coveted. Even though they were identical, correspondents could somehow tell if their machine had been swapped with another. Despite their reliability, they occasionally needed attention‚Äîoften due to spilled coffee or an overzealous writer jamming the paper injector.

**News Writers, Technicians, and Others**

The rest of the newsroom used a motley assortment of Royal desk typewriters, ranging from early ‚Äò60s ‚ÄúEmpress‚Äù models to various versions of the later Royal 440. Many had been ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù by contractors, which typically meant they were stripped of paint, refinished in generic flat black, and dunked in solvent before being relubricated. If necessary, the platen might be replaced, but the refurbishing company CBS used never restored labels or logos, leaving these machines as anonymous ghosts in the newsroom. Though functional, they never commanded the same respect as the older Royals or the Olympias.

**The Shift to a Digital Newsroom**

About a year into my tenure, the newsroom began transitioning to digital technology. The first step was replacing the teletype machines and typewriters with computer terminals. Then, digital audio technology replaced the old Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorders. Writers had to adjust their typing techniques to the new keyboards, which was especially difficult for the two-finger typists accustomed to hammering away at their Olympias. They grumbled about it incessantly.

Within a few months, the typewriters and teletype machines were gone, and the newsroom was a much quieter place.
