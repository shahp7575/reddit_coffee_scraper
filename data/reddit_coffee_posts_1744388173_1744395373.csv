I've become a big fan of exploring beans from top roasters around the world. Browsing cafes around town, I've seen a few rotational options (SEY, Morgon Coffee, Dak, Tim Wendelboe, Onyx, etc.) but unfortunately they're always there for just a short bit of time and then the cafes move onto something else. I always have a preference of seeing/smelling the beans rather than ordering bags and bags of beans online (ie. Eight Ounce Coffee, still a great resource of course).

Would you folks have a definitive list of cafes that always stock a good selection of premium beans? At least if there's a list, hopefully one of them is carrying what I'm looking for :). Here's some cafes I've personally come across. Would greatly appreciate building out the list.

* Arvo
* Rooms
* Fika
* 10 Dean
* Brick Room

PS. I'm quite familiar with a lot of the big name roasters in Toronto/GTA such as Hatch, Subtext, Found, T3, DeMello, Verada, Ethica, and so on. I enjoy quite a few of them but am looking to branch out. Thanks!",1,1744395286.0,FoodToronto,0,1.0,False

I've already tried a bunch of scents they don't like and I don't want to have to kill them if I don't have to.,"My kitchen door opens up to my back garden, which has some ants roaming about in it. A few of them have ended up crawling into my kitchen and I keep finding them around the door. They don't seem to venture any further into the house or be interested in any food storage areas. I think they are just investigating/lost. 

So, I sprinkled a bunch of coffee and cinnamon on both the inside and outside of the door. I then also mixed dried garden mint, lavender essential oil (pure), neem oil (pure), lemon juice, coffee, and washing up liquid in water and sprayed it on the inside and outside of the door, as well as on the pathway outside the door. I also sprayed it around the sides of the door too (I can't reach to spray it along the top). 

I also brush my kitchen floor every day and mopped thoroughly on the day I first noticed the ants to remove their pheromone trails and any food residue they may be detecting on the floor. I usually mop once a week. 

The ants are still coming in though. I just watched one crawling over the small pile of coffee inside the door to get in. They don't seem to have been deterred by anything I've done. 

I dont want to kill them or have to use harsh chemicals, expecially right next to where I store and prepare food. What can I do? Why don't they seem to care about the mixture of deterrents? ",1,1744395198.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

His work ethic. His negativity. His hillbilly teeth. The face that he smokes and doesn't clean his mouth. The way his saliva feels on my skin. The sliminess when he goes down on me.

The fact he spends every moment possible in a dark room playing video games and watching anime.

His lack of mature taste in food and alcohol. The 16 coffees a day he drinks, with absolutely no water. The way he blames me for working a full time, year round job instead of a seasonal part time job.

Everything about him just grosses me out. There's been events since 2013 that have led me to this point, and they're significant. It's not just me being petty and bitchy.

1jwwk11,https://v.redd.it/tslpjxs6y8ue1,"Cycling from Alaska to Argentina: +16,000 ft [4,876 m] Passes on the Peru Great Divide","I’ve been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and reached the highest mountain passes of my life on the Peru Great Divide. 
 
Services faded toward nonexistence as the cold grew increasingly severe. Remote villages might have one tiendita and one comedor, otherwise you’d be lucky to pass through any given town on the same day as the vegetable truck. Atop each mountain waited torrential blizzards of horizontal snow and hail, with shards of ice collecting on my tent by morning.
 
In a frostbitten whiteout above 16,000 ft [4,876 m] I missed a hairpin turn in the red gravel road and ended up climbing an extra hour, adding warm winter layers as I went, headlong into a hailstorm.
 
Still the colors up top were immaculate. Ensuing descents, insane. Some peaks were sage green, some the darkest shade of red wine. Others a liquid type of orange as if still maturing, all ribboned with veils of ice and snow that hardly ever melt away. I slid across the shrapnel in reckless abandon, hurriedly scouring rocky embankments for a place to camp before the tortured grip of darkness took hold.
 
My tent zipper snapped in the rime. Rain gear, no longer waterproof. Then came a panicked race for cover before thick berms of ice could pelt the rainfly once again. More Mars-like desert. More lassos of headwind. Huge plates of white rice and a whole thermos of coffee. Body crumbling over and over with nowhere to escape to and no way to get there, just raw specters of emptiness in all directions.

1jwwj6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jwwj6k/a_cursed_melody_a_lost_soul_and_revenge_fueled_by/,"A Cursed Melody, A Lost Soul, and Revenge Fueled by Desire","I should’ve never gotten involved with this piano business. From the very beginning, I had a feeling something was off—but you know how it is; sometimes people take the most dangerous paths just to fill a void, without even realizing it. It's not about the music. It’s about the loneliness. Maybe I just wanted to drown out the echoing silence in my home.

I’ve been living alone for three years. No visitors. Nowhere to visit. The only human contact I have is the cold, polite greetings exchanged at work. I’m a teacher. A music teacher. Throughout my life, melodies have been my most loyal companions. But lately, strangely enough, nothing I played seemed to bring me any joy. It felt like even the sounds were avoiding me, hiding beneath the keys.

That’s why I decided to buy a piano. One I could play freely in my own home, even in the late hours of the night. But I had no money. Or rather, my salary was barely enough to entertain the thought of buying new furniture.

I spent days scrolling through online listings. The prices? Insane. Even the lowest quality pianos, with yellowed keys and scratched bodies, were double my budget. Despair was becoming a habit when suddenly, that listing appeared.

Polished wood, elegantly carved legs, like something straight out of the Baroque era. Despite its elegance, the price was unbelievably low. Fifty dollars. I rubbed my eyes, checked the date, refreshed the page. Still there. Still fifty dollars. I looked at the photos over and over again. Taken from every angle—the inside, the outside, the keys, the finish. Everything was extraordinary. It felt like a bad joke, yet… something inside me kept whispering that something was wrong.

Still, I messaged the seller. My fingers were trembling as I typed. How strange… It was just a piano, but I felt as uneasy as if I were ordering a gravestone. The man replied quickly. “If you cover the transport cost, I can send it right away,” he said. I agreed. He sounded confident, but something was off. His messages were short, rushed. He didn’t say anything unnecessary. He gave me the address. That was it.

On the day of delivery, I arrived to find him in the middle of moving out. The door creaked open, and I saw boxes, half-empty shelves, stacks of books. He was definitely moving, but… he didn’t have that look of relief people usually wear when they leave a place behind. It felt like he wasn’t leaving a house, but escaping a memory. As we talked, and I approached the piano, I couldn’t hold back.

“You’re selling it for so cheap… there’s nothing wrong with it, is there?” I asked, my voice trembling a little.

Our eyes met. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and he didn’t answer right away. He cleared his throat.

“I’m moving… it won’t fit,” he said. But something was missing in his voice. The words didn’t come from deep within—they were just lip service. A script.

As the piano was loaded onto the truck and carried down the narrow apartment stairs, it paused so many times I lost count. But I just stood there, watching. Even then, the strange feeling inside me stirred. I thought, “Why doesn’t this piano feel like it belongs to me yet?”

When it arrived at my place, I placed it in the corner of the living room. The afternoon light filtered through the window and hit the keys, and the entire room lost its silence in an instant. It felt as though something invisible had entered, thickening the air.

I sat before it. Reached out and played.

The first note—it didn’t just vibrate the strings, it vibrated something inside me.

As I played that first melody, something loosened within. It wasn’t my fingers playing, it was the rusted memories of my childhood. A strange peace filled my chest, but curled within that peace was a thread of unease. The piano’s sound was extraordinary. Soft yet deep, old yet flawless. The tone felt familiar, like a stranger you instantly trust.

I played for minutes on end. My hands got used to it, the melodies flowed, time seemed to bend. When I finally looked up, it was past midnight. My fingers were numb, but the emptiness inside me felt a little less hollow. I gently closed the lid, leaned in, and whispered:

“We’re not done yet, you and I.”

I headed to bed. The house sank into silence. But that night, it wasn’t true silence. The walls seemed to breathe, the dim light of the lamps flickered. The curtains swayed gently—though the windows were closed.

“You’re just adjusting,” I told myself. “A new object, a new sound… your brain is tricking you.” But my heart didn’t believe it. I fell asleep with difficulty. And every time I drifted deeper, I awoke again—as if someone were counting my breaths.

And then… that sound.

A high-pitched, trembling note from the piano. Then another, and then a chord. My eyes opened. I sat up, a lump in my throat. At that moment, I realized—I wasn’t alone in the house.

I got out of bed in the dark. My feet crept across the wooden floor as the house watched in breathless silence. I stopped at the living room doorway.

There, on the piano, was my cat. Her white fur glowed like a pale ghost in the moonlight. She was pressing the keys with her front paws. Random, unintentional.

I let out a deep breath, caught between relief and irritation. “You again? Scared me half to death,” I whispered. She turned to look at me, but her gaze… was strange. It lasted too long. As if she were trying to say something. I picked her up. Just as I was turning to leave, the piano’s lid slammed shut with violent force. The sound echoed through the room, and the strings resonated with a haunting tone—like the sob of a graceful woman.

I couldn’t sleep that night…

My cat’s gaze wouldn’t leave my mind. And the sound from the piano—it hadn’t been random. There was a pattern in the notes. As if something was being told. A story, a sentence… or a call.

By morning, my eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep. I looked at myself in the mirror. Exhausted, yet oddly eager to sit at the piano again.

I made my coffee, opened the curtains, and sat down. I dusted it off, placed my hands on the keys. I began playing. Slowly, I played the first melody again. Then something else… something I’d never played before. The melody wasn’t in my mind, but somehow my hands knew it.

And then…

Something whispered from beneath the keys. Maybe it was just the wind. Maybe the creaking of old wood. But a voice inside me rose:

“You didn’t choose this piano… It chose you.”

The next day, after work, my feet carried me straight to the piano. As if nothing else I did that day mattered. As if my very existence continued there—between the keys, within its frame, in that strange silence.

Before playing, I decided to clean it a bit. Just for peace of mind. Maybe I could understand why the lid slammed shut that night. Maybe a spring was loose, maybe the old wood couldn’t hold itself up anymore… I needed to believe something rational. Not out of fear—at least, that’s what I told myself—but for sanity’s sake.

I grabbed my tools and gently opened the lid. Inside… it was like a forgotten tomb, once filled with music. The strings looked like cobwebs, the wooden body had surrendered to moisture. But what struck me most was the smell. A faint scent of burnt metal… but older. Not mold, not dust. More like… the scent of something waiting. Patiently. Silently.

As I wiped the inside, something shimmered. Just a glint at first. I thought it was a staple, but as I looked closer, I realized it was paper. Wedged into the piano’s inner frame. I pulled it out with trembling fingers. Yellowed, crumpled paper. A melody was handwritten on it. Very old notation. Like a code.

But the strange thing? There was a note scrawled along the edge, faded but still legible:

“When this melody is completed, it will complete you. Or completely end you.”

A tingling started in my gut. Logic said, “Leave it.” “Tear it up. You don’t have to play it.” But curiosity… is the easiest way to lose your mind. Especially when something unexplained is involved.

I looked at the score. Then at the piano. Then back at the paper. Eventually, I gave in. I sat down.

And I played.

The first key… rang out with a strange resonance. Its sound lasted just a bit too long. I felt like something else in the house had answered it. The walls, maybe? Or the heart of the house.

The second note was deeper. I thought I saw a shadow stir in the corner of the room.

Third… fourth… A melody began to take shape. Strange, unsettling, but captivating. It pierced me. The tones echoed inside my head. With each note, it felt like something was peeling away within me.

Midway through, my hands started trembling. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something in the living room. Someone standing, watching me. But when I turned, nothing. I faced the piano again. The notes weren’t in my mind anymore—they were in my hands, playing on their own.

And then I got tired. I don’t know why… maybe the unsettling tone wore me down. I wanted to switch to another piece. At that moment—

The piano lid slammed shut on my hands. A sharp crack. One of my nails split. I tried to pull back, but for a moment, it felt like the piano didn’t want to let go.

Instinctively, I stood. The stool fell back. My left hand throbbed. I stared at the piano. Silent. Just dust… and that cursed melody echoing in my mind. Inside, I felt something strange: As if I hadn’t played it—something had pulled it out of me.

And in that moment, I understood.

This piano was not made to be played.

This piano… was made to listen.

The next night, I sat still for a long time, staring at the piano. My fingerprints were still visible on the keys. It stood there as if nothing had happened the night before. As if it had all just been a bad dream… But even dreams have an end. This didn’t. That melody still echoed inside me – that incomplete, unsettling, imprisoning melody – it kept looping in my mind. I had to play to silence my thoughts. As if it wasn’t just music, but the key to breaking a curse. As if finishing it would set me free.

I hesitated for a while, but eventually, I gave in and sat at it again. My fingers touched the keys gently at first. Then faster, more passionately. The notes didn’t seem to come from within me, but rather into me from somewhere else. It wasn’t up to me. My hands weren’t mine anymore. They had already made the decision.

The melody no longer felt familiar. I wasn’t playing from the sheet anymore. The notes were being born on their own. My body had become an instrument of the piano’s will. My eyes welled up, but I didn’t cry. It was more like a drowning sensation. The keys hurt my nails. But I couldn’t stop. My hands felt glued to them. Literally glued. The more I tried to pull them away, the harder they pressed.

Suddenly, the bench trembled. No… it moved. Not backwards, but forwards, towards the piano. It was pulling me in.

I wanted to get up, but it was impossible. My hands were magnetically stuck. My knees buckled, but the bench remained still. My legs were shaking, but my hands pressed even harder on the keys. The sounds I produced were no longer music, but screams. Strange, piercing, the scream of something alive.

Then, I felt a sharp pain in my left thumb. A jolt of pain shot through my brain. My eye felt like it would pop out. My nail… had come off. All the nail beds were red. Blood was seeping between the keys. I wanted to scream. I couldn’t. My mouth wouldn’t open. My tongue felt like it had been shoved back. Like a fist lodged in my throat. I couldn’t breathe, but I kept playing. My fingers trembled rhythmically over the keys. Ignoring me, my body, my mind.I lost all sense of time. I don’t know how many hours passed. I just remember darkness falling before my eyes. My connection to my body slowly faded. I was becoming the sound of the piano. Or maybe the sound itself was consuming me.

And then…

Suddenly, the bench pushed me back. I was thrown violently. My hands were freed. My palms burned. My breathing slowly returned to normal. But… I heard a sound.

A whisper.

Not from nearby. From within.

""You must feel it.""

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. My fingers were bandaged, but they were still trembling. I stared into my eyes in the bathroom mirror for a long time. My eyes felt like they belonged to someone else. I was still me, but something else… something foreign… was inside. As if a piece of the piano had broken off and slipped into me.

Three in the morning. My eyelids grew heavy. I couldn’t resist and collapsed onto the couch. As soon as I fell asleep… it began again.

I was in a truck. The far wall was rusted, chains hung from the ceiling. I was being held by my ankles. Both of them. The same two men who had once moved the piano. They had no faces. In place of faces… were piano keys. The keys moved up and down. Laughing, it seemed. One grabbed my wrist, the other my arm. They dragged me toward the piano in the back. The same piano. Exactly the same. Bloodstained. Cracked. My fingerprints still on it.

“No!” I tried to scream. It only echoed inside me.

The lid opened on its own. The cursed melody I had once played poured out again. But this time, the notes were reversed. As if someone had turned them inside out. The sound… it resembled a human voice, but not one that came from a mouth. From something without a mouth. The truck started moving. I jolted. They pushed me toward the piano. I couldn’t resist. My hands… touched the keys again. 

And again… I had to play.

I woke up abruptly. Eyes wide, throat dry, drenched in sweat. I got up. Without thinking, I grabbed my phone and called two people. “Take this cursed thing out of my house. I don’t care where you take it. Just… let me never see it again.”

They came. One was young, the other in his fifties. “Don’t give it to anyone,” I said. “Burn it, bury it, destroy it.”

The young one smiled and shook my hand. “As long as you pay, brother, we can dump it or donate it.”

They loaded it into the truck. The back door slammed shut. They left. That night I thought I slept peacefully. But true peace… had been erased from my vocabulary.

In my dream, I was there again. The same truck. The same chains.

But this time… I was the one being loaded into the back. And where it was going.

No one knew.

Life, somehow, continued. It had to. I took long walks to clear my head. I didn’t speak to anyone. I couldn’t explain this to anyone. Who would believe me?

If I said, “I played the piano, and my hands wouldn’t let go,” they’d laugh.

If I said, “My fingers moved on their own,” they’d tell me to take my meds and lie down.

So I stayed silent. Swallowed it all.

I buried the fear deep in my eyes.

So it would never come out again.

Months passed. Slowly, I started to recover. My fingers regained their flexibility. I began giving private lessons, teaching children basic notes. As long as I could control the sounds, I could control the fear.

One day, through an old acquaintance, I was offered a music teaching job at a public school.

I accepted. Maybe, for the first time, I would do something “normal.” The school was a two-story, worn-out building a bit outside the city. When I entered, a crumbling corridor greeted me. But what really mattered to me was the music room. The vice principal handed me the key. “It’s a bit messy inside, but it’ll shape up,” he said.

I opened the door.

The room was dim. Curtains drawn. The air was heavy. In the center, something covered in a white sheet stood. I thought it was a table at first. But as I got closer… the shape became familiar. A strange excitement crept over me. I tried to suppress it.

I grabbed the sheet. Lifted it slowly. A cloud of dust rose into the air.

And at that moment…

My heart clenched like a fist in my chest. It was that piano. That cursed, hell-spawned piano.

The same scratches, the yellowed marks on the keys, the crack on the upper left corner…

It was the same.

The piano that once took my fingers, then my mind, then nearly my life. I backed away. My breath caught.

But inside me, a voice – a very old one – whispered:

“Maybe this time… it’ll listen to you.”

I stepped forward again. Touched the keys. A sharp, high note rang out. Like a child whispering. Just as I was about to pull away…

The white sheet in my hand came to life. As if someone grabbed it…

It wrapped around my neck.

Started to squeeze.

My throat clenched.

I couldn’t breathe.

My knees gave out.

Right then, the door opened. The principal. His eyes widened, and he rushed toward me. The sheet was still around my neck, but loosening. I collapsed to the ground. I tried to speak, but my tongue wouldn’t move.

The principal, voice trembling, said, “He did it himself… like he was wrapping it around like crazy.”

Then came the ambulance.

Then IV fluids.

Then a week in a psychiatric hospital.

Diagnosis: Crisis-induced temporary dissociative hallucination.

That’s all.

That’s all, apparently.

If you believe it.



When I got out of the mental hospital, the weather was cold. But I didn’t feel cold.

It was as if I had forgotten how to be cold. Besides, I could no longer tell the difference between feeling something and not feeling anything.

There was only one thing inside me: the desire to end it.

I had to finish it. If I didn’t close this book, that piano would eventually either drive me insane… or kill me.

There was something inside it. It wasn’t a sound. It wasn’t even music. It was a presence. Something with emotions, desires, a will of its own. A will infused into the piano’s wood, its string system, maybe even a long-hidden fragment buried inside.

And I… I had met that will. I hadn’t seen its face, but I had felt its fingers. It had passed through me. When school was out, I returned. I didn’t tell anyone. I waited for the sounds of students leaving, seeping between the doors. They left. The principal, the janitor, the guard… all gone. As night fully descended, I slipped inside.

I brought three things with me:

A bottle of gasoline…

a cigarette.

And a lighter.

When I entered the music room, my eyes looked for that white cloth again, but this time, it wasn’t there. The piano was there. Standing like a coffin.

My footsteps echoed. I circled around it. Poured the gasoline gently — on its wooden surface, between the keys, beneath the pedals…

I lit my cigarette.

That tiny spark would either save me or dig my grave.

I took a drag.

And flicked the butt.

The flames were cautious at first. Then they spread everywhere. A soft crackling began in the room. Just like… just like the primitive creaks that came when playing the piano.

A voice inside me said, “It’s over.”

But at that moment, I felt a drop of coolness fall from the ceiling.

Sprinklers.

It was as if the school’s nervous system refused to let itself die.

 Water poured.

The fire died.

And I just watched.

Only watched.

I approached the piano.

It had burned… but it was alive.

Like a monster.

Wounded but furious.

The next morning, the principal didn’t even look at me. I didn’t look at him either.

That evening… I found an old, rusty axe in the schoolyard. I wasn’t going to speak to it anymore.

I wouldn’t play it.

Wouldn’t listen.

This time, I would strike its body.

I entered the room.

Locked the door.

And started swinging.

With each blow, the wood cracked. With every crack, I thought I heard a scream.

Was it real? I don’t know.

But when I stopped hearing the pieces it used to play, when I saw its shattered body…

I knew.

It was just wood now.

I was exhausted. But for the first time, there was real silence inside me.

A hum in my ears…

But nothing in my soul.

Zero.

Finally, zero.

I went home. While struggling with insomnia, the idea of buying another piano came to me.

But this time it would be something proper.

Not cursed.

Beautiful.

Clean.

I opened the internet.

And at that moment…

The entire screen froze.

An ad popped up.

Something that shouldn’t have appeared — not within my filters, not in my budget, not from outside my city…

The exact same photo.

The same piano.

Fifty dollars.

Same address.

Every muscle in my body froze. It was like someone was pressing on my shoulder.

But there was still one spark left inside me. This time, I would ask. Without fear.

I messaged the seller.

Pretended to be a new buyer.

Got the address.

This time, I brought something with me.

My grandfather’s old war pistol.



I knocked on the door. The man who opened it wasn’t familiar. But his face wore a strange expression. Not smiling, not threatening. As if he already knew everything.

“Come in,” he said.

And I entered. For answers. And maybe… one last nightmare.

The moment I stepped inside, the house was nearly dark. The curtains were drawn.

No air flowed. It didn’t feel like a home — more like an abandoned stage.

Everything felt ready and waiting.

The man who had let me in walked ahead. As I looked at his back, something inside me stirred — an unnamed familiarity. And yet, terrifying. I couldn’t clearly see his face; he never fully turned.

He sat on one of the couches.

I remained standing.

My gun was in my hand, but in that scene, I didn’t seem like the one holding the weapon.

It was him.

In his eyes… his silence… in this strange atmosphere…

Then he spoke:

“You played it too, didn’t you?”

“What?” I said. It wasn’t a question — it was a scream.

“The notes. That sheet. Every hand that plays it leaves a trace… and each trace calls to the next.”

My breathing grew erratic.

“You… you gave it to me. You knew what it was.”

The man squinted at me.

Now, there was an expression on his face.

Weariness.

But older than death itself.

“I didn’t give it to you,” he said. “It chose you.”

“Who?!”

“The Pianist.”

I froze.

This had to be a joke.

But inside…

Inside me, that deep voice… quietly agreed.

“Who is the pianist?”

“He was once someone like me. His hands bled. His nails tore off. His sleep was shattered. Something seeped into his soul and swallowed him. But the worst part… one day, the music stopped. So he sought other hands. Wrote down the notes. Found someone to play. And with each new player, a piece of him returned. Until… he was fully awake.”

My throat dried.

A bitter taste in my mouth.

As if all the truths were rising like blood in my throat.

“You… did you play that piece too?”

The man lowered his head.

“I did. I couldn’t finish it. I ran. But he didn’t forgive me. And I know… he won’t forgive you either.”

I pointed my gun.

Not from fear anymore.

I was afraid of losing my mind.

Afraid of walking that line.



“Just tell me the truth. That piano… what is it? What does it want from me?”

“Your voice,” he said.

“Your voice. The pure feeling at the tips of your fingers… It doesn’t just want to be played. It wants to live.”

My head spun.

The walls were closing in.

I had to sit.

That melody…

It started playing again in my ears.

But this time, I realized—

The melody wasn’t mine.

But it played from within me.

“How do I stop it?”

“It doesn’t stop. But you can. If you don’t accept it, if you don’t live with it… maybe you’ll just forget. Maybe… after years, it’ll feel like just a nightmare. But you’ll always stay alert. It’ll always watch. Just like now.”

He turned his eyes to the window.

So did I.

The curtains slowly opened on their own.

And outside…

On the corner of the street…

A truck was parked.

The same truck.

The one that brought the piano.

The one that took it away.

The one from my dream.

There was no one visible in the driver’s seat.

But the engine was running.

Smoke was rising.

Then something hit me.

“I’ve… been here before, haven’t I?”

The man smiled.

One of those fatal smiles.

Like the mouth of a grave.

“You have. A long time ago. And you asked back then too. And you didn’t believe. Then you pretended to forget. But it… doesn’t forget.”

I stood up.

There was only one thing left: escape. Maybe running wasn’t salvation… but forgetting might be a chance.

I headed for the door. But before I left, I turned one last time.

“What’s your name?”

“I have no name anymore,” he said.

“I’m just… the bearer of the sound.”

And I left.

When I stepped into the street, the truck’s headlights turned on. But it didn’t move. 

It just sat there. Like a memory.

Forgotten, but never erased.

Since that day, I never played the piano again.

Never touched a note.

But that melody still echoes in my ears.

When the night gets quiet, sometimes I hear a piano from the other end of the house.

I don’t get up.

Because I know:

I’m not the one playing.

But someone is.



And with every note…

is 10:00 am by now and i closing in on the zone that had been prepard for my equipment, the event is happening 1.2 km to the east from where im situated so im going to have to do something about the sun hitting my face, and the reflection of the scope; luckily employing a cover on the scope to cut reflection and the glare would be the right solution; 12:00pm the objective i s closing in position;, after being on my stomach for 1 hr my chest is starting to hurt , better that working 9 to5 still; since this hit would provide enough income for the next 4 years of my basic needs; living a lonely life is cheaper than building one.

the bullet is in the air; flying at speeds over the one of sound, almost magical, this are the moments where my heats skips 2 beats and my butt clenches, will all this epsually pay, or did i took the risk for nothing; motherfuckers always be moving last second, and 1 KM is enough to make a diference; It Hit ! ; nice moment to pack up and leave; i might get a beer tonight with he boys; and tell em about the new sales i made at work.

1jwwhfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalContact/comments/1jwwhfz/peruvian_agroindustry/,Peruvian Agroindustry,"**Good day, fellow entrepreneurs,**

I’d like to share my current situation with you. I’m Peruvian and based in South America. Peru is one of the largest exporters of agro-industrial products in the region — meaning that many of the fruits, vegetables, coffee, or teas you consume in your country might actually come from here.

As an entrepreneur, I currently have access to very attractive pricing on coffee and tea — ideal for anyone with a distribution network or looking to build their own private label brand (white label) online. I also offer established brands of both coffee and tea.

Let me share a bit of information about these ventures. I usually don’t use social media much, but I’m now looking for ways to bring high-quality Peruvian products to more parts of the world. These products are truly premium — pure flavor, guaranteed quality.

Additionally, I can help source other Peruvian agro-industrial products such as **cacao, pisco** (a strong traditional Peruvian spirit), **blueberries**, or **asparagus**, depending on your needs.

👉 **My main question is simple**:  
Is there anyone here with a distribution network or interest in developing a private label for high-quality agro-industrial products?

Here are links to the current brands:

If any member happens to be genuinely interested in this topic, I’d be more than happy to have a proper conversation and share more details privately.

Please note that we source products **directly from the harvest**, with **no middlemen**, meaning better pricing and more control. I hope this message reaches someone interested in building something solid and meaningful.",1,1744394989.0,GlobalContact,0,1.0,False

Life was going in study, eat, scroll, repeat. Nothing exciting, nothing tragic. Just... a smooth, boring ..
Until one random flight completely shook things up literally and emotionally. I was flying back to Kathmandu from my house. Window seat, earphones in,(Hanuman chalisa bajirakocha Because malai dar lagcha flight ma ekdam) Duniya ko matlab chaina jasto garera.. Mid-flight, turbulence started hitting pretty bad. Everyone tightened their seatbelts, and I was chill until the girl sitting next to me suddenly grabbed my hand. No words, just this tight, panicked grip. I looked at her she was clearly scared. I smiled a little and said, “Don’t worry,  uh hera ta tyo agadi ko sano bachha cha uh ta darako chaina bhane tmi ta k darauchau .” She laughed, and that broke the ice. That moment later turned into a full on conversation. We talked the whole flight random stuff, deep stuff. Air traffic le garda plane pani lagvag 30 to 45 minutes extra vayo. Like everything was set up for us, lol. When we landed, I felt like I’d known her for ages. We exchanged numbers and somehow kept talking even after that flight. Few days later, we met up. Just casually for coffee. Walked around the city sajha ko time ma, got some street food, sat by the and talked for hours. Slowly, we started hanging out more study sessions, late night calls, meetups, deep convos, even some peaceful weed sessions. There was one evening on the rooftop of a cafe we were smoking, lo-fi beats playing, gadi ko horn continue and she looked at me and said, “Timi sanga basda time slow jasto lagcha.”
But here’s the wild part since we met, my life’s been different. In a good way. Like, I don’t know what kinda magic she brought, but suddenly I’m doing better. My focus improved, I’ve been more consistent with studies, feeling more confident, less anxious. Everything feels lighter, clearer. It’s like I’ve been operating on some invisible good luck boost. And now, I feel like she’s hinting at something. The way she looks at me, those soft little gestures, some things she says like there’s something unspoken between us. But nothing direct. And I’m stuck scared to misread, but also scared to ignore something real. So yeah, that’s where I’m at. Vibing with this beautiful connection, overthinking, and not sure what to do next.

The way we view the world, our beliefs, our long term goals they don’t align. Qe are living the same moment but dream very different futures. And that makes me wonder can something that feels so right now still survive what’s waiting down the road? So yeah, I’m lost in this beautiful mess. What would you do if you were me?Any advice?

Weeks before the wedding, he showed me the watch like it was a trophy. VSF Submariner. “Super rep,” he said. “Looks identical.”
I nodded, but inside? I cringed.
You don’t wear a fake to your wedding. Not when her dad eats, sleeps, and breathes haute horology. Not when you’ve got everything on the line.

But he was proud. Said it made him feel “put together.” Said no one would know.

Someone knew.

I watched it unfold like a slow car crash. Franklin spotted it from across the room—guy’s got the eye of a sniper when it comes to watches. One second, he’s smiling. The next, he’s locked on like the Sub was blinking SOS. He walked over, all charm and calculation.

“Where’d you get it?” he asked.

I couldn’t hear the reply from where I stood, but I didn’t need to. I knew. I saw it in Franklin’s face. I saw it in hers, too—when she looked at the watch, then at the man she was about to marry, and realized…

He wasn’t who he said he was.

And that’s when she shut down. I saw it. Lights out. She looked at him like she’d just realized he was a hologram with a Coinbase wallet.

She walked before the ceremony even started. No tantrum. No tears. Just class, silence, and five thousand dollars worth of calla lilies left blooming in the background.

Me? I gave a respectful amount of time. Helped him pack up his boutonnière. Gave him a shoulder pat and a vague “these things happen, bro.” Then I found her.

We talked. Laughed a little. Drank a lot. One bottle turned into two. Then she looked at me and said, “Anywhere but here.”

So we went.

One-way flight. Middle of the night. No plans, no bags, no rings. Just her, me, and a duffel bag full of undone expectations.

This morning? She’s still asleep. Wearing my T-shirt. No ring. No regrets.

And me?

I’m sitting here on a balcony, ocean breeze in my face, sipping coffee and scrolling Chrono24—not for a fake, but for the real deal. I figure if you’re gonna show up in someone else's story… might as well end it on your terms.

he hasn’t asked for anything I’m uncomfortable with. like he’s generous, respectful, way hotter than he has any right to be, and also.. really good in bed. like weirdly good. I don’t understand what’s happening to me lol.

Today I am at 7ish DPO (maybe more, maybe less) and I've been having cramping, a bit of nausea, a headache, stomach issues, and pelvic pain. My period is 8-10 days away, so it seems odd to be having PMS symptoms now. To throw even more confusion into things, we are also currently getting a mold issue fixed in our house, so the timing of some symptoms could be that as well. I'm just writing all of this down, because it is too soon for me to say any of this out loud. That would be a little too real, you know?

I wanted to share my experience, what worked, what didn’t, and some quick thoughts on the process.

**Features**:

* Uses a photo to generate a custom Barbie-style action figure.
* Add personal accessories like books, drinks, or hobbies.
* Creates a toy box design with your name and slogan.
* Free to try with a basic ChatGPT account.

**Pros**:

* Super fun and creative! I loved seeing myself as a doll.
* Easy to use – just upload a photo and type a prompt.
* Quick results, usually in a few minutes.
* You can tweak the design if the first try isn’t perfect.

**Cons**:

* Free version limits you to a few tries per day, which can be annoying.
* Results depend on photo quality – blurry pics don’t work well.
* Sometimes the doll doesn’t look like you, even with tweaks.
* No option to save high-res images without a paid account.

**My Experience**:

I uploaded a clear, full-body photo and used a prompt like, “Make a Barbie doll of me in a pink box with a coffee cup and sunglasses.” The first result was cute but didn’t quite capture my face. After tweaking the prompt and trying a sharper photo, it got closer! I had a blast picking accessories that screamed “me,” like my favorite book. But I hit the daily limit fast, which was frustrating since I wanted to experiment more. Also, the box design felt a bit generic unless I got super specific with my wording.

Overall, it’s a fun way to play with AI, but don’t expect perfection every time. Anyone else try this? What did your doll look like?

**Disclaimer**: This post shares my personal experience with the AI Barbie doll trend. Others might have different results or opinions. I’m not suggesting anyone should or shouldn’t try it. Please make your own decision and don’t rely solely on this post. Always review the terms of any AI tool before uploading personal photos.",1,1744394489.0,AIToolTesting,0,1.0,False

Uveo si avokado, izbacio jaja i kobasice. Tako je, u svom stilu Joško Jeličić nedavno izanalizirao Fabija Cannavara i njegov učinak u Dinamu. Komentatoru HNL-a sve je bilo jasno odmah nakon onog debakla od Istre. A sad je Fabio Cannavaro, Zlatna lopta i čovjek koji je trebao preporoditi Dinamo, napokon dobio ""pedalu"". I zvuči bizarno, ali uistinu je točno to što dobro obaviješteni Jeličić kaže, da je Talijan iz nekog razloga uveo drastičan režim prehrane, uz treninge dvaput na dan koji su znali trajati i po tri sata i 20 minuta. Nutricionist je bio stalno uz njega i uveo ""diktaturu"" koja nije pasala igračima. Valjda je Cannavaro mislio da je to najveći Dinamov problem.  
  
Kako je u veljači pisao Germanijak, Cannavaro je u klupskoj kuhinji zabranio jaja na oko za doručak, isto vrijedi i za kruh, a na meniju više nema ni bifteka, crvenog mesa, juha i salata. Prehranom dominiraju losos i piletina, a riža i tjestenina moraju biti bez glutena. U nužnu prehranu ubačeni su špinat na pari i pečena cikla. No Cannavaro je imao još dva bizarna zahtjeva. Poguran pomoćnikom, nutricionistom kojeg je doveo.  
  
\- Ovaj sokovnik, leti van! Kupujemo novi. Aparat za kavu, ajmo, hoću novi isto - tražio je čovjek s najulaštenijim cipelama ikad koje se sjaje kao bjelanjak odmah čim je došao. Ispostavit će se međutim da je Dinamo zbog njega morao naručiti sokovnik od - kako kažu naši maksimirski izvori - osam i pol tisuća eura i aparat za kavu od šest i pol tisuća eura?! Dinamo jest dobrostojeći klub i na računu je na kraju sezone ostalo oko sedam milijuna eura plusa, ali takve zahtjeve nije imao niti jedan trener prije njega.  
  
Istina je, treneri znaju imati mušice, Dinamovi navijači sjetit će se kako je Vaha zvao Mamiće u tko za koje doba noći da mu ne štima satelitska televizija baš kad je sjeo gledati utakmice. Izludio je Zdravka Mamića. Ali Vaha je imao rezultat, imao je igru, i to s puno slabijom momčadi i slabijim proračunom nego što ga je imao Talijan. Cannavaro? Usred borbe za naslov nagazio je dinamovce na treninzima tako da ne mogu hodati na utakmicama, pa Lončar, Valinčić, Rozić, Lisica i ekipa iz Istre pored njih jure kao Tadej Pogačar, makar su Puležani tijekom tjedna igrali kup-utakmicu, a Dinamo nije. Ne, nešto u cjelokupnoj pripremi momčadi nije štimalo. Cannavaro ih je gazio na treninzima, a dinamovci nisu bili spremni na žestoke obračune s Rijekom, Istrom, Hajdukom... Baturina se ugasio, Kulenovića je ugasio Cannavaro, Kanga... Ah, Kanga.  
  
Svaka čast zdravoj prehrani, ali avokado i sojino mlijeko ne dobivaju utakmice. Dva aparata, sokovnik od osam i pol tisuća i stroj za kavu od šest i pol tisuća, zlobnici će reći da je to sve što je Dinamu ostavio Cannavaro. I osam bodova minusa za Hajdukom. Coffee to go, Fabio.

(And, but, or)","This only crosses my mind every once in a while, but it drives me irrationally mad when a song begins with a conjunction. Conjunctions are supposed to connect thoughts, not open them. I'm not the biggest grammar Nazi out there, but I'm definitely in the upper ten percentile. 

It all started when I found a song called All That You Are by Goo Goo Dolls back in late 2019. It starts out ""and I feel all the faint morning light."" It's a beautiful song, but why couldn't you have opened it with ""*Oh* I feel all the faint morning light""? Like come on, now. 

My all-time favorite album is Affirmation by Savage Garden. There's a song called Two Beds and a Coffee Machine, which is a very heavy and beautiful song. I love it, but it starts with a damn conjunction. So does that mean that the last lyric of the song before it on the album (The Lover After Me) is connected to it as one sentence? 

""The lover after me, and she takes another step"". You see how stupid it sounds? 

Songs don't always have cohesive or realistic sentences. I mean, Reason by Hoobastank has a lyric that goes ""I found a reason for me to change who I used to be"", which has always felt a bit clunky to me. Still, I can let that go, but ever since I learned ""you can't start a sentence with and, but or or"" back in school, I just haven't been able to let that go.

Trump’s tariff tango with China (we’re talking 145% duties!) sent shockwaves, making bonds riskier and spooking the financial world. 

Here’s the tea: the bond crash forced Trump to hit pause on tariffs for most countries (except China, oof), dropping them to 10% for 90 days.

What’s next? If China dumps their $760B in US Treasuries, we could see inflation go whoosh, interest rates mooning, and your mortgage feeling like a Marvel movie budget.

I need help to navigate a situation please. 

So she has a brother in hospital who was very ill in ICU.  He is out of ICU now.  She wants to visit him and she wants me to go with her and she's only just after telling me today. She wants to go and visit him tomorrow. 


I was telling her that tomorrow doesn't suit me and also I hardly know this uncle and to be honest, I can go to the grounds of the hospital to the coffee shop but I don't want to go up into a ward. 


She wasn't happy with this and she really wants me to go with her to visit him tomorrow. 


I asked her does she know what ward he is on and I suggested contacting his wife and she said don't be contacting her, she is in there every day and she's probably busy every day going into the hospital and she said that she will ask at the front desk of the hospital. 

She really doesn't make any sense to me.  She can find out what ward he is on by just asking my aunt. 

A while later I decided to send a text to my auntie and ask her what ward is he in because my mother is interested in visiting him.  She replied and she told me. 



So now I know what ward he is on. 


Now I am left with this mess of a situation. She told me not to contact my aunt.  I went behind her back and did it anyways. It made sense to quite simply ask. 

So what do I do? Do I tell my mother or do I lie to her? Maybe I can say there was generic text sent to everyone from my aunt.   My mother doesn't have a smart phone and doesn't know how to use one either. 

So will I tell my mother that I know what ward he is on. Or will I wait until tomorrow to tell her. 

Also I can accompany my mother into the hospial but I don't want to go into a ward.  It's just I am not a full time carer for my mother and I still have a busy and hectic job to hold down and I am not working tomorrow but I am finding so much very overwhelming lately and I need time out to centre myself.

You might start to feel more alert and awake within this time frame.**

But why does coffee work this way, and what happens in your body? Coffee is a popular drink for many people around the world. Its main ingredient, caffeine, is what gives you that energy boost. When you drink coffee, caffeine enters your bloodstream and travels to your brain.

Here, it blocks a chemical called adenosine, which makes you feel sleepy. This is why coffee helps you feel more awake and focused. But remember, different factors like your metabolism and how much coffee you drink can change how quickly you feel the effects. So, let’s dive deeper into what influences how fast coffee kicks in.

# Factors Affecting Caffeine Absorption

Enjoying a cup of coffee is a daily ritual for many. But how long does it take for coffee to kick in? The answer depends on several factors affecting caffeine absorption. Understanding these factors can help you get the most out of your coffee experience.

# Metabolism Rate

Your metabolism plays a big role in how quickly caffeine affects you. People with a fast metabolism process caffeine quicker. This means the effects can be felt sooner, often within 15-30 minutes. On the other hand, those with a slower metabolism may need to wait up to an hour to feel the full effects of caffeine.

Several elements influence your metabolism rate:

* **Genetics:** Your genetic makeup can dictate how fast your body processes caffeine.
* **Age:** Younger individuals generally have faster metabolisms.
* **Activity Level:** Regular exercise can boost your metabolic rate.
* **Health Conditions:** Certain medical conditions can slow down metabolism.

Here’s a quick comparison:

|Factor|Effect on Metabolism|
|:-|:-|
|Genetics|Can speed up or slow down caffeine processing|
|Age|Younger individuals process caffeine faster|
|Activity Level|Increased activity boosts metabolism|
|Health Conditions|Can slow down caffeine processing|

# Food Intake

What you eat before or with your coffee affects how quickly you feel its effects. Consuming coffee on an empty stomach leads to faster absorption. This is because there is nothing to slow down the caffeine entering your bloodstream.

Conversely, having food in your stomach can slow down the absorption. This is due to the fact that the body is busy digesting food, and this process can take priority over absorbing caffeine.

Consider these points about food intake:

* **Empty Stomach:** Faster absorption, quicker effects.
* **Heavy Meal:** Slower absorption, delayed effects.
* **Type of Food:** High-fat meals slow down absorption more than high-carb meals.

Here’s a quick comparison:

|Food Intake|Effect on Caffeine Absorption|
|:-|:-|
|Empty Stomach|Quicker absorption|
|Heavy Meal|Slower absorption|
|High-Fat Meal|Slows absorption the most|
|High-Carb Meal|Slows absorption, but less than fat|

# Caffeine’s Journey In The Body

Coffee is a beloved morning ritual for many. But how long does it take for coffee to kick in? Understanding caffeine’s journey in the body helps answer this question. Once you sip your favorite brew, caffeine begins its fascinating trip through your system. Let’s explore the stages of this journey, from consumption to digestion.

# Consumption

The journey starts with the act of drinking coffee. When you take that first sip, caffeine enters your mouth. The absorption process begins almost immediately. Here are some key points about consumption:

* **Absorption begins in the mouth:** A small amount of caffeine is absorbed through the mucous membranes.
* **Swallowing:** The majority travels down your throat to your stomach.
* **Stomach arrival:** Caffeine meets stomach acids and enzymes.

Most of the caffeine absorption happens in the small intestine. This process is quick. Within 15 minutes, caffeine reaches your bloodstream. The peak level in your blood occurs in about 30 to 45 minutes. This is when you start feeling the effects. Here is a brief timeline:

|Time|Event|
|:-|:-|
|0 minutes|First sip|
|15 minutes|Caffeine in bloodstream|
|30-45 minutes|Peak blood concentration|

During this time, you may start feeling more alert. Eyes widen. Focus sharpens. The caffeine is working its magic. But the journey doesn’t end here. Next comes digestion.

# Digestion

Once caffeine is in your bloodstream, it travels to your liver. Here, it is broken down into three compounds:

1. **Paraxanthine:** Increases the breakdown of fats.
2. **Theobromine:** Increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain.
3. **Theophylline:** Relaxes muscles and opens airways.

These compounds then travel through your body, affecting various organs. The central nervous system is one major target. Caffeine blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel sleepy. This blockage leads to increased neuron firing. Your pituitary gland senses this and releases hormones. These hormones signal your adrenal glands to produce adrenaline. This adrenaline surge is why you feel more awake and energized.

The effects can last for several hours. The half-life of caffeine is about 5 hours. This means if you consume 200 mg of caffeine, 100 mg will still be in your system after 5 hours. Factors like age, body weight, and metabolism can affect this duration. Here’s a simple breakdown:

|Factor|Effect on Duration|
|:-|:-|
|Age|Older adults metabolize caffeine slower.|
|Body weight|Heavier individuals may process caffeine faster.|
|Metabolism|Faster metabolism = quicker caffeine breakdown.|

Understanding caffeine’s journey helps explain how long it takes for coffee to kick in. From the moment you drink to the digestion process, every step affects how quickly and strongly you feel the effects.

For me, they become a way to blend into certain moments in life. I often listen to them with my earbuds on when I’m focused on something or walking through familiar places. It’s like scoring my own scene in a story, even if I’m just on a quiet ride or sitting at a coffee shop.

Unlike regular songs with lyrics or catchy hooks, OSTs often rely on emotion and atmosphere. They don’t demand your full attention, but when you do pay attention, they enhance the moment deeply. Sometimes it’s calming piano pieces, other times it's dramatic string sections that mirror an inner feeling — whether tension, sadness, or hope.

I rarely choose them at random. I pick a track depending on how I feel or the kind of vibe I want to immerse myself in. It’s not just passive listening — it’s more like matching my internal state to the music’s emotional palette. And in those moments, I’m not just listening — I’m inhabiting the music.

I recently went from an occasional Aeropress user (since 2012) to using it daily for 2-3 cups, so I decided to upgrade to the Premium. Here's my whole setup:

* I love my Hario V60 electric burr grinder. I don't store beans in the hopper because I just put in the amount I want each time with my trusty scoop.
* The repurposed salsa jar that I grind the beans into also serves another purpose... when I'm roasting, I fill it to the bottom of the threads with green coffee beans for a half pound batch without weighing.
* Obviously the Aeropress Premium
* The Aeropress sits perfectly in a small widemouth Mason jar.
* The Joeveo Temperfect Titania mug was a Kickstarter impulse buy that was way too expensive, but now with years of use it's getting close to free on a per-cup basis. When I sponsored it on Kickstarter, I first confirmed the mouth is just right for an Aeropress.
* And there with all that expensive gear is a cheapo Hamilton Beach kettle that has served faithfully since around the time electric appliances were invented.
* My filters aren't shown. They are out of frame on a shelf next to the coffee bean canisters, in the cylindrical holder I got with my first Aeropress.

My Aeropress Premium arrived last night, so I used it this morning for the first time.

* I didn't try anything fancy, just used the same technique as with my classic Aeropress.
* I use both a metal filter and a paper filter, which is just the right resistance for me. I'm making coffee not pseudo-espresso, so I fill it all the way up, and the minimal amount of flow-through is insignificant. The Premium seems basically the same as the plastic one for me in that regard.
* There's 1 problem I need to solve: the heavy plunger on the Premium is unstable when I put it in the top of the filled Aeropress to stop the flow for steeping. The plunger tilted and I grabbed it just as it was falling. And even if the plunger didn't fall, the whole thing is top heavy and I worry could easily tip over with just a minor fumble (which can happen when I haven't any coffee yet). I'm sure with a little trial and error I'll get a working technique for this. I'm going to try taking the rubber seal off my other Aeropress to use as a stopper for steeping - obviously I could use the whole plastic plunger, but I actually like the idea of a simple little stopper. (EDIT: I just realized the obvious - the plunger diameters aren't the same.)
* The metal base gets somewhat warmer than the plastic. Not dangerously so, but noticeably.
* Bottom line is that the coffee is indistinguishable betweeen the 2 models. I miss the lightweight convenience of the plastic Aeropress, but making the switch to the Premium to avoid plastic for my daily driver is worth the adjustment.",1,1744393611.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1jwvrv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1jwvrv1/i_lowered_my_ldl_cholesterol_by_150_points_in/,I lowered my LDL cholesterol by 150 points in three months. Here’s how:,"tl;dr:

* I had extremely high cholesterol levels: 354 total with LDL at 265 and HDL at 82 in November 2024.
* Rather than take recommended statins, I educated myself by reading the New York Times bestselling book, *A Statin Free Life,* by Dr. Aseem Malhotra, and vowed to reduce my cholesterol levels thru diet and lifestyle changes with a goal of 15% reduction in three months.
* I radically changed my food intake from a high-protein, Paleo/keto-esque diet to a Mediterranean diet with a pointed focus on consuming soluble fiber from legumes and other veggies.
* After three months, I lowered my LDL cholesterol levels from 265 to 105 (total cholesterol levels went from 354 to 162) 🎉
* My PCP had never seen such a dramatic change in his 30+ years of practice.

**Background:**   
  
In November 2024, I saw my PCP for a regular check-up and requested labs to be run for the first time in my life. For context, I’m 37-year old male; non-smoker, not overweight, with regular strength and cardio training. All results came back with flying colors *except my cholesterol levels:* 

My total cholesterol level was 354 – with my LDL at 265 and HDL at 82. 

For context, current Western medicine practices describe healthy levels of total cholesterol at 200 and LDL cholesterol levels below 100 (\*see note at end).

My PCP was very concerned about my heart health, especially since one of my grandfathers died at approximately 40 years old from heart failure. Other members of my family also have elevated cholesterol levels and take prescribed statins. The doctor recommended that I begin to take a statin, specifically Crestor at 20mg, to lower my LDL levels.

However, I had also read articles and listened to podcasts about the “statin industrial complex,” its failure to improve patients’ health, contested longevity claims and other detrimental effects of statin use. In short, while I embrace Western medicine in many ways, I am largely skeptical of mainstream medicine’s approach to treat chronic diseases, especially when pharmaceutical drugs (see: greedy corporations) are in play to treat symptoms rather than root causes.   
  
Leaving the doctor’s office, I – defiantly and somewhat ignorantly – set the goal to lower my cholesterol *without* the use of statins by at least 15% in three months.  
  
In three months, I vowed to return for new labs and achieve the following goals: 

* Lower my total cholesterol from 354 to sub-300.
* Lower my LDL cholesterol by 20%, ie from 265 to 212.
* Lower my LDL:HDL ratio from 4.3 to 4.0 or lower.

To cut to the chase, three months after my original labs, I returned to the doctor and got my cholesterol levels run again without having taken statins. Here are my results:

|Cholesterol levels|Original (11/2024)|New (02/2025)|% Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total |354|162|\-54%|
|LDL|265|105|\-60%|
|HDL|82|45|\-45%|

My PCP had never seen such drastic improvements in cholesterol levels in 30+ years of practice. He almost couldn’t believe the results.

*The most important step in this journey was picking up,* A Statin Free Life, *by Dr. Aseem Malhotra, and following these recommendations, specifically following a Mediterranean diet.* I recommend that anyone seeking to educate themselves about cholesterol and statins to read this book. It is a quick read.

**Food change: From Paleo to Mediterranean**

When I walked out of the doctor’s office in November, I knew that I needed to change my diet. In short, I transitioned from a Paleo/Keto diet to a Mediterranean diet with focus on soluble fiber in legumes and grains. I’m as sure as can be that this change was the primary reason for reducing my LDL cholesterol by 150 points in three months. 

Pre-November 2024, my main nutrition goal was oriented around my resistance and aerobic training: To consume at least 150 grams of protein per day. 

A typical breakfast was three to four eggs. Typical lunch or dinners: Roughly 8oz of steak, or chickpea pasta with red sauce and chicken breast, or two cans of tuna fish with mayo and seaweed, abundant salads, hummus and veggies, and more eggs. I used ghee to saute almost everything (I’m allergic to the lactose in butter).  
  
**New food lifestyle: What did I NOT eat?**

After my initial labs, I turned my food routine upside down. I eliminated all foods high in saturated fat and all processed foods. More specifically, I eliminated the following: 

* Red meat and pork
* Butter, ghee and all vegetable oils – except olive oil
* Fried foods
* Processed foods 
* Ice cream and other sweets
* Bread and grains – except German bread ([example](https://www.mestemacher-gmbh.com/))
* Sugar and sweeteners\*
* Eggs\*\*

\*I still add/ed about a tablespoon of maple syrup into my morning coffee

\*\*The jury is still out on the impacts of moderate egg consumption on cholesterol levels. I chose to go more or less cold turkey, although by the start of month three, I began to eat two to three eggs per week (not per day, as before).  

**New food lifestyle: What did I eat in abundance?**

Broadly speaking, I now focus on eating foods low in saturated fat and high in soluble fiber, and lots of veggies. The diet that is closest to this lifestyle is the Mediterranean diet. I now eat the following foods in abundance:

* Oatmeal and chia seeds
* Soups with legumes
* Vegetables, especially cauliflower, carrots
* Hummus – *without added canola/sunflower/vegetable oils*
* Chickpea pasta with red sauce
* Salads with leafy greens
* German bread
* Non-fat Greek yogurt
* Tuna fish with mayo
* Salmon (wild, not farm-raised)
* Sweet potatoes
* Chicken breast
* Fish sticks (comfort food 😊)
* Gluten-free pumpkin pancakes
* Extra virgin olive oil  

A few additional notes on food:

* Overnight oats became a staple food. I now eat overnight oats every morning; it is ritual. Also, I add a lot of chia in my overnight oats since they are very high in fiber. (My overnight oats might be more appropriately called “overnight chia-oats”)
* No butter or ghee: I replaced ghee for olive oil in sautéing food (yes, I’m aware of the lower smoke point). 
* Abundant EVOO: I liberally consume olive oil: I probably consume over a cup of raw extra virgin olive oil per day on German bread, salads, soups, veggies etc.
* Spices and aromatics: I abundantly use Ceylon cinnamon and turmeric as well as fresh ginger and garlic for taste and anti-inflammatory properties.
* As a rule of thumb, avoid the use of ""conventional"" (ie herbicide/pesticide-sprayed) produce. Most of this produce is banned outside of the United States due to carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting properties.  

Some go-to recipes that I use:

* [Overnight oats](https://www.loveandlemons.com/overnight-oats-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-65537) (I add a lot more chia seeds and use NF Greek yogurt) 
* [White bean soup](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020503-parmesan-white-bean-soup-with-hearty-greens) (I used less parmigiano, more white beans, and add roasted cauliflower) 
* [Oatmeal pumpkin pancakes](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-pumpkin-oatmeal-pancakes/)

**Lifestyle changes:**

I’m convinced that switching to a Mediterranean diet, focused on soluble fiber, was the primary factor contributing to my reduced cholesterol levels. However, other lifestyle factors may have also contributed to my elevated cholesterol levels, including (mental) stress and (physical) over-exertion.

Like for many, my work can be stressful – so I began taking more short breaks, being gentler on myself, and meditating in the morning for approximately 15 minutes at least five days a week. 

Before my first lab tests, I also followed a fairly intense workout regime: I would engage in anaerobic and aerobic exercise 4-5 times per week. After my lab tests, I reduced this amount to 3-4 times per week. I also use the sauna at the gym 3-4 times per week (12 minutes at approximately 190F).  
  
**In conclusion:**

I do not purport to have a cure-all for everyone with elevated cholesterol levels. For example, some people have genetically-inherited high levels of cholesterol and they may benefit from taking a statin. I do not condemn the use of statins as a whole.

However, from my own experiences, I also believe that **diet and lifestyle changes can hold immense and undervalued benefits for reducing LDL cholesterol levels.**  

In my opinion, the fewer pharmaceutical drugs that I take and the more naturally-aligned lifestyle – ie eating whole, unprocessed foods – that I can live, the better.

*A Statin Free Life*, by Dr. Aseem Malhotra, was godsend and I recommend anyone interested in learning more about cholesterol, and reducing their levels, to read this book. 

A couple other notes:  

* From my research, if you smoke or are obese, these two conditions need to be addressed ASAP.
* I plan on returning to my doctor for new labs every six months. I will update this post with results.

I hope this summary of my experiences helps you or your loved ones on your journey to live a healthy and life-affirming experience of this miraculous world!   
  
*Bon appetit and love life!* 

\*The threshold for “healthy” cholesterol levels have changed over the years, perhaps informed by interests by pharmaceutical companies to capture more profits from higher usage of statins. Again, please read *A Statin Free Life* by Dr. Aseem Malhotra.",6,1744393211.0,Cholesterol,7,0.8,False

I would NOT recommend to put the cup in the dish washer - the bottom says ""dishwasher save""... the cup/ material (stainless steel) is, but the paint isn't. The dishwasher may harm the paint sooner or later. Some finishes are more prone to damages from the dishwasher than others. Recommendation: handwash only.  
Some people put the lid and straw in the dishwasher but not at high temperatures and they make sure the parts don't get in contact with hot surfaces (put them in the silverware basket for example and don't use programs that run on high temperatures).

Get a straw brush to clean the straw inside.

Don't use abrasive sponges/ products because the may damage the cup or leave scratch marks. 

Stains/ weird odors?  
For stubborn stains or odours, baking soda can help. Make a paste with a little water and apply it to any stained areas. Let it sit for 30 minutes before scrubbing and rinsing. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer and works wonders on coffee, tea and power drink stains.  
Denture tablet in hot water also works well.  
For a deeper clean or to combat lingering odours, a vinegar solution is the ideal solution. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water, and fill your Stanley to the brim. Let it soak for an hour, then rinse thoroughly. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and cuts through tough grime.

What to do (if anything)?,"**EDIT: I think people are getting confused by my question. I am wondering whether I should talk to him about the *lying*. My question is not whether I should talk to him about the gaming habits themselves.** 

Hello, this is sort of a weird thing and I (26F) feel awkward asking my friends about it—so here I am. Basically, I’ve caught my boyfriend (28M) lying right to my face about his video game habits a few times now and I don’t really get why he isn’t being honest with me. I really do not like lying in a relationship, even if it is about innocuous things: Still, I’m not sure if it’s actually that big of a deal—is it worth a conversation, or would it be best to just let it go?

We’ve been together four years, lived together for three. During that time, he’s always played a lot of video games. I have 0 problems with him playing video games as a hobby—I even got him a PS5 for Christmas this year. Since I got him the PS5, his video game playing has definitely increased a lot. Any time we have down time he’s playing games. I don’t mind and have never told him that he needs to stop or anything.

He works fully remote (software development) and I work at an office, so I’m gone all day. Today, I had a doctor’s appointment and was planning to work from home after. I ended up finishing the appt earlier than expected and got home a bit early (around mid-morning). When I walked in, I could hear the sound of the PS5 power button being turned off. He was standing up like “oh hi” when I stepped around the corner. The video game controller was on the coffee table, and the drawer where he keeps his gaming stuff was open. Basically, it was very clear he was playing video games. Here’s how the conversation went:

He was standing there all awkward, so I was like “hi. Uhh, whatcha doing?”

He said, “working.”

I looked him up and down (he’s still standing up) and said, “oh?”

“Yeah, I was working on the couch for a bit today.”

“Really? Why’s your gaming stuff out?”

“Oh, well I was gaming for a bit before 9.”

“Before 9? It kinda seems like you were playing them when I came in.”

“Well, I was sort of playing them on and off with work.”

Eventually came to light that he’d just been playing games all morning. I’m a little annoyed that he lied to me about it, especially when it was so clear that he was lying. Like I get that playing games while on the clock isn’t something to be proud of, but I’m not his boss…

I was thinking afterward that this type of thing has happened before a few times. One example was a period of time where he was unemployed for a few months. He always told me that he worked a full work day in terms of sending out job applications during that time. Well, a couple of weeks after a new game came out, he was talking to my brother and mentioned that he’d already beaten the game, and that it had taken him about 80 hours. I was like, hold the phone, *80 hours*? It had only been a couple of weeks and he hadn’t played it any time when I was around him—it was clear that he’d been playing it all day while he was unemployed, and then just fully lying to me about what he did all day. He didn’t really have an explanation at the time and just reiterated that he just played games “some” of the day.

**TL;DR: My boyfriend has lied to my face about his gaming. I don’t like the idea that he’s lying to me like this, even if it is about something small.**

**Is this something to have a conversation about, or best to let it go? If a conversation, what do I even say?**",1,1744392987.0,relationships,11,0.56,False

I think most of us knew he had something to do with Nate! The fact he tranquilise him and left him to die doesn't sound the word ""hero"" to me. We also saw that he wrapped his body and dumped him into the river (which was shown in the flashforward on NYE).

Other flashbacks we saw were:

Mixing up Chas' tablets and all this left Liam and Chas thinking it was Ella. Clearly it wasn't. I knew it.

Throwing a brick through the window, again Liam and Chas pointed the finger at poor Ella. So clearly she was telling the truth all along.

Saving Ruby and Moira during the barn fire back in the Summer/Autumn, leaving Nate to die.

Lastly (this wasn't flashback) taking Jacob's AAI so he can save him, after he swapped the sticker of the coffee, which contained almond milk. 

But, all the important one is putting someone in a coma, and that person is >!Mackenzie, no doubt.

When was the last time we saw him in the scene? The only time I can remember was during after the limo crash and we haven't seen him since.!<

He was always very quiet, despite being a highly anxious dog. He was a Covid puppy, his first few months of life were spent with a pretty anxious family who kept him in a too-small crate and never socialized him due to the pandemic. 

We’ve had him since he was maybe 6 months old.
He never barked much. But suddenly, when he turned 4, he started barking at every little thing. There was no traumatic event, we can’t think of what caused this- possibly a bad Fourth of July? it seemed to just happen. 

In the middle of the night, he would start barking and barking at every little sound out in nature. 

The only thing that calmed him down was having him sleep in this quiet but spacious walk-in closet away from all windows (“triggers”?).

Now we’re in a new house that’s split level. We don’t have a walk-in closet thing anymore, but we do have a whole level of the house above the basement that’s blocked off from windows and outdoor triggers.

We’ve gated off the floor for him for when company’s over (very rare) or for sleeping at night. We’ve given him a comfortable bed down there, his food and water, all his toys, etc.

Last night he was barking and trying to knock the gate down for a while, but he gave up and DID sleep the night down there. This morning though, he started barking at about 5AM and trying to knock the gate down again.

Any advice on how to get him to sleep through the night in comfort down there without us?

Other context: I work from home, so somebody is essentially with him 24/7. The only time we try to spend “away” from him is bedtime, and if we go out for coffee/etc on weekends.

We generally have avoided things like shock collars or anything that could seem inhumane by some standards.

1jwvkdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingGeek/comments/1jwvkdu/real_talk_if_youve_been_there_youll_get_it/,"Real talk – If you’ve been there, you’ll get it","I just lost a local SEO client —  
Not because I did something wrong,  
But because I did everything *right*… except making them feel like I actually cared.

This was a local coffee shop near my place.  
Helped them from day one — set up GMB, cleaned up their on-page, built clean backlinks.  
They hit top 3 in the local pack within 2 months.

A few months later, they left.  
No complaints. No drama.  
Just a message: *“Hey, we’ll pause the service for now. Thanks for everything.”*  
I was stunned. And yeah, it stung a bit.

Looking back, here’s what I learned:

🔹 **Doing the work ≠ showing the work**  
I thought they saw the progress.  
Turns out, they just saw silence.

🔹 **No check-ins = no presence**  
SEO isn’t “set it and forget it”. It’s about *showing up*. Regularly.

🔹 **Local SEO = people + presence**  
I slowly treated them like just “another task” instead of a business I was growing *with*. That mindset ruined the relationship.

🔹 **Overpromising is self-sabotage**  
I said we’d hit certain goals. But markets don’t care about promises. When results didn’t match the hype — trust dropped.

🔹 **Even when they leave, follow up**  
A simple “thank you” or “wishing you success” message might’ve kept the door open.  
But I let embarrassment win. That was the final mistake.

Not posting this to complain — just to remind myself (and maybe someone reading this):

**Clients don’t just want results.**  
**They want to feel like they matter. Like someone’s** ***in it*** **with them.**

1jwvjq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jwvjq2/the_night_watch_miskatonic_research_complex/,The Night Watch (Miskatonic Research Complex Chronicles 2),"Tom Reilly adjusted his midnight blue security uniform as he began his afternoon shift at the Miskatonic Research Complex. After fifteen years with the Massachusetts State Police, he had thought the security job would be a quiet way to coast toward retirement. Shows what he knew.

He thumbed through the shift log from Ethan Caldwell, the day guard, nodding at the usual notations—a grim yet darkly amusing chronicle of Miskatonic's daily routine. ""Dimensional wobble in Lab 6—maintenance responded and left a hastily scribbled note that said: 'This again?' It appears to have been added to their to-do list, right after 'calibrate the screaming crystals.'"" ""Unsettling lullabies emanating from cold storage—recorded for the baffled linguists in xenophonetics. Initial analysis indicates a possible rhythmic structure resembling ancient Sumerian death chants, but with a surprisingly catchy melody."" ""Break room coffee machine experiencing sentience again—IT mumbled something about firmware and holy water then threatened it with a rubber chicken. It has begun leaving passive-aggressive sticky notes about spilled sugar.""

""Just another Tuesday,"" Tom muttered, though it was Thursday. Time, like sanity, tended to get a bit wobbly around Miskatonic.

Tom began his rounds through the west wing, his badge gleaming under the fluorescent lights that occasionally flickered in patterns that seemed almost deliberate. Unlike most of the guards, he kept his sidearm loaded with custom ammunition—silver-tipped hollow points with cores of blessed salt, all blessed by Father Michael down at St. Eldridge's. Not standard issue, but neither was anything else about this place. The weight of the weapon was reassuring against his hip, like an old friend who understood that some monsters were very real.

The protoplasm section was housed in the basement level, just past the radioactive materials storage. As he descended the stairs, the ambient temperature dropped ten degrees, and the familiar smell—like ozone and overripe peaches—filled his nostrils. He had long stopped trying to describe it to his wife. Martha had stopped asking after that dinner party where he'd attempted to explain his day and accidentally silenced the entire table for twenty uncomfortable minutes.

""Evening, Dr. Schaefer,"" Tom nodded to the hunched researcher who was peering intently at a containment unit labeled ""Sample 43-B: Innsmouth Tidepool.""

""Hmm? Oh, hello, Officer Reilly."" The scientist barely looked up. ""Do you think this resembles a face? The movement patterns suggest rudimentary intelligence.""

Tom glanced at the grayish-green mass pulsating behind the reinforced glass. The substance had formed what did indeed look like a crude approximation of a human face, with hollows for eyes that seemed to follow his movement. For a moment, the face appeared to smile—a rippling movement that made Tom's skin crawl beneath his uniform.

""I'd recommend not making eye contact, sir,"" Tom said evenly. ""Remember the Danvers incident.""

Dr. Schaefer paled slightly and adjusted his protective goggles. ""Yes, quite right. I'll note your observation.""

Tom continued his patrol, passing the triple-locked door to what the staff euphemistically called ""The Aquarium."" The small window revealed glimpses of the massive tank within, where shapes moved in the artificially salinated water. The creatures' ancestors had once been human, or so the file claimed. Tom kept walking, ignoring the soft tapping on the glass that followed him down the corridor. The sound always reminded him of his daughter playing ""Shave and a Haircut"" on the piano, except no one in the tank had fingers. At least, they shouldn't.

In the monitoring station, he logged in to review the security feeds. Camera 12 showed the usual blind spot in corridor C—no technology seemed capable of recording whatever existed in that ten-foot stretch of hallway. Camera 23 displayed the artifact storage, where the glass cases occasionally shifted position between frames, despite weighing hundreds of pounds. Nothing unusual there.

Then Tom noticed something on Camera 8. A figure in familiar gray coveralls was pushing a cleaning cart through the east wing. At first glance, it appeared to be Ellis, the night janitor—except Tom knew Ellis wasn't scheduled until 11 PM. This figure wore Ellis's coveralls complete with the custom heavy-duty gloves Ellis always wore, and Ellis's work boots. A maintenance cap was pulled low, obscuring where the head should be.

Tom narrowed his eyes, watching as the figure methodically moved through its cleaning routine with Ellis's characteristic efficiency. The coveralls seemed... fuller than they should be, as if something broader than Ellis occupied them. When the figure bent to retrieve a dropped cloth, the coveralls stretched in ways human anatomy wouldn't allow. The sleeves extended a good six inches longer than they should have before retracting as the entity straightened up.

""Well, I'll be damned,"" Tom muttered, taking a sip of his coffee. He made a note in the log but added no alert code. Some things were better left unacknowledged in official records. His former colleagues at the State Police would have immediately called for backup. Two years at Miskatonic had taught Tom that sometimes, the best response was no response at all.

Twenty minutes later, Tom encountered the Ellis-shaped entity while patrolling past Laboratory 4. Up close, he could see the subtle wrongness more clearly—the slightly too-long arms, the way the coveralls moved as if filled with something denser than human muscle and bone. Where the neck should have been visible below the cap, there was only shadow, a darkness that seemed to absorb the fluorescent light rather than merely blocking it.

Tom tipped his hat politely. ""Evening.""

The coveralls turned toward him, and the gloved hands came together in a perfect salute. Tom noticed a faint shimmer in the air around the outfit, like heat waves rising from hot asphalt, and caught a whiff of something that reminded him of the sea at low tide.

He shook his head and chuckled as he continued down the hallway. ""If Ellis only knew,"" he thought. ""Though maybe he does. Hard to tell what anyone really knows in this place.""

Tom had seen far stranger things during his tenure. Last month, he'd caught Dr. Whately from Theoretical Physics having an animated argument with his own reflection—except the reflection wasn't mirroring his movements and appeared to be winning the debate. The whatever-it-was seemed to be doing a decent job cleaning and hadn't harmed anyone yet. Live and let live—even when the definition of ""living"" got philosophical.

Before ending his shift, Tom made his way to the small shrine hidden in the boiler room. Ellis thought no one knew about it, but Tom had discovered it during his second week. Today, he added his own offering—a jelly donut from the good bakery in town—placing it carefully beside Ellis's stale bagel. The small carved figurine that stood at the center of the makeshift altar seemed to face slightly more toward the donut than it had a moment before, though Tom couldn't swear it had moved.

""Can't hurt to hedge your bets,"" he murmured, performing his own small ritual of touching his badge, then his wedding ring, then making a sign that his grandmother had taught him—one older than Christianity in the Massachusetts hills. His grandmother had called them the ""old gestures for the old things."" She never explained what the old things were, exactly, but growing up in Arkham, you didn't need explanations for precautions.

Back at the security desk, Tom completed his logs as Larry Davies, the night guard, arrived for the evening shift. Larry had transferred from the Boston PD after an incident involving what the official report called ""impossible ballistics."" Tom never asked for details, but he recognized the look in Larry's eyes—the look of someone who'd seen something that shouldn't exist and could never quite unsee it.

""Morning, Ralph,"" Larry said with a smirk, punching in his timecard.

""Morning, Sam,"" Tom replied automatically, continuing their long-running joke based on that old cartoon with the sheep dog and the wolf clocking in for their daily routine. Sometimes, the familiar absurdity of the reference was the only normal thing about their day.

As they exchanged notes on the day's events, Tom considered mentioning the Ellis-shaped entity but decided against it. Larry was still new—only eight months on the job. Some things you had to discover for yourself at Miskatonic. Besides, whatever was wearing Ellis's coveralls hadn't set off any of the more esoteric security measures hidden throughout the facility, which meant it probably belonged here in some fundamental way.

""Anything I should know about?"" Larry asked, adjusting his holster. Tom noticed Larry had added his own customization—a small vial of what looked like mercury attached to the leather.

""Coffee machine's acting up again,"" Tom said. ""Oh, and whatever you do, don't make eye contact with Sample 43-B. It's feeling sociable today.""

Larry nodded seriously. ""Got it. See you tomorrow, Tom.""

As Tom walked to his car, he glanced back at the imposing façade of Miskatonic Research Complex. Behind those walls, researchers probed the boundaries of reality while things from beyond those boundaries occasionally probed back. And in between them all moved the custodial staff—both the human and the other kinds—keeping the balance.

Tom slid into his sedan, placed his service weapon in the lockbox, and turned the key. Another shift complete, another day the world hadn't ended. In his line of work, that counted as a win. As he pulled out of the parking lot, he caught a glimpse of Ellis arriving early for his shift, whistling cheerfully as he walked toward the building entrance. Tom smiled, wondering if Ellis would notice his coveralls were already at work. Probably not—some mysteries were better left unsolved, especially at Miskatonic.",5,1744392635.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Sometimes someone with a saxophone or a violin will play outside. Winemakers come host a free tasting every Friday. The artisanal brewery next door sometimes has rock concerts so I’m always listening to music I like while I’m working. There are fifteen tables, shelves of eclectic wine and a tiny deli. Not to be dramatic but it’s like a whimsical fairy cafe. The sister designs the food, the brother manages, the dad does the admin and the mum decorates the shop. 

My managers are introverted, patient and very kind. I was always nervous to work in service because of stories about condescending, outright cruel and disorganised management. My main manager, who is the son of the owner, told me he worked at Disneyland and Chef’s Warehouse, and that his managerial style sits somewhere between those styles. I think all three of my managers were born for what they do, because they manage to maintain a full restaurant with a 4 metre squared kitchen functioning soundly while *never* raising their voices. They say it is never necessary (unless they are arguing with each other). Having grown up with parents who are nice, but very short-tempered and shouty, it’s really refreshing. The money is pretty nice for a student in South Africa, but admittedly it gets tough in winter because most of our tables are outside. But on slow days we usually just watch stupid videos with the managers around the corner, prepare cutlery and such. 

After busy and tiring shifts, we all sit under the same pretty ornamental lamp and try a bottle of wine - it’s always a surprise - and the manager teaches us about the notes of the wine and its terroir. Us waiters are in our early twenties, the managers late twenties.  I really get along with the other waiters. If there’s a new cocktail or dessert, we also try that out. The coffee machine is also free rein, which honestly got me into working there lmao. I don’t have a car, so when my boyfriend comes to pick me up they pour him a glass too. This place makes you feel so valuable that you start to genuinely care for its success, improve your service and even gain qualifications in wine. The managers often lend out books about wine to take home.

The main manager’s fiancé also works in management, and is a waiter too. She always says my hair or nails look pretty on days when I’m feeling down. She and her best friend, who works as a waiter sometimes, really helped me when I was struggling with my science degree. Surprisingly, there is no odd power dynamic considering she’s engaged to the owner’s son. When a drunk/high old guy purposely wasted my time for half an hour, she sternly told him to leave and stop wasting my time. One of the male waiters with a low tolerance for bullshit and rude customers also deals with these people. They literally come back, which shocks me, but on some better behaviour??

There was a nightmare manager that was hired for a couple months. He was the full package - misogynistic, didn’t let the girls take breaks to eat, stole a Prada jacket from a customer (I promise I am not joking), shouted and screamed. He would transfer tables to himself as tips were being collected, would threaten waiters and kitchen staff to “say things to his face” instead of reporting his behaviour to the head manager. When his previous boss came into the place to eat, he literally hid under the front counter until he left. He stood out like a sore thumb, didn’t show up to his disciplinary hearing and that was the end for him. I got a cafe job for a while in my university town but literally everyone employed there acted like him and I had zero patience/backbone for that. It was also a really soulless atmosphere.

About a third of our customers are regulars, they are mostly lovely, but obviously there are some people with their own issues that they project. Like this middle aged lady that goes on lots of first dates, then said that placing the bill in the middle instead of handing it directly to the man is “embarrassing service”. She also had an issue with the fact that I looked at the man first while asking what they would like to drink. It’s a small-town place so a lot of customers actually introduce themselves to you and they often ask where you live and such (not in a weird way). I like the customers, and I think the waiters maintain a high standard of service considering how relaxed our management is. At the end of the day serving people, shitty or not, is just the job and I’ve learned to not take rude people personally.

I feel like it’s become commonplace and almost expected that this industry is cutthroat and irrationally stressful with power tripping and corruption. Of course, peak hours have had me spinning quite a few times. It’s so unnecessary for it to be toxic on top of that. My friends joke that I’m so spoiled here that I’m going to be gravely disappointed by any other job I get, especially in a lab haha. He’s definitely right. I found myself standing at my new job in a nearby town missing this place like some heartbroken ex. There was no true point of this post except to brag about this slice of peace while the rest of my life is nearing shambles.

1jwvj0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jwvj0b/workplace_gossip/,Workplace gossip,"Honestly maybe I am overreacting- who knows. But I am considering this a safe place to vent for now. 

My workplace since finding out I’m pregnant has been gossiping about everything I eat or consume- I expected it to some degree in a healthcare workplace. 

I work a job that literally has me on my feet 4/5 shifts for a good 8 hours. 

But regardless- I have a mtn dew in the morning sometimes instead of a coffee (not saying it’s great) but that’s my caffeine for the day. Then they’re coming after me for eating little bits of candy- trust me I know it’s not the healthiest either. But if a little piece of chocolate is giving me enough sanity to not cry I’m going to do that. 

But anyways- my diet is now workplace gossip and I’m annoyed and a little paranoid about anything I eat or consume here that isn’t considered “healthy” ie chicken or salad. 

Side note: my doctor has no concerns, and has encouraged me to drink more caffeine or more medicine if it means helping my headaches. My child has still been kicking consistently everyday",3,1744392589.0,pregnant,8,0.8,False
1jwvip6,https://www.reddit.com/r/moving/comments/1jwvip6/millennial_couple_destination_options_usa/,Millennial Couple Destination Options (USA),"Hello, and thanks for looking! I (35M) and my domestic partner (32F) are looking to sell our current house in TX and move elsewhere in the US. We have no kids and have had procedures to ensure that we don't. We both have flexible remote jobs (within the US only) and a house budget between 500k-850k. Our priorities are:  
1. A walkable city where we don't need to get into the car often to get good vegetarian/vegan food, coffee, bars/breweries, groceries, etc.

2. Buy a house (under 2000sqft) with some yard for our greyhounds to run in. No condos/duplexes/HOAs. Property can be relatively small.

3. Safe. This should probably be #1, but we don't and won't have kids. We also both know how to handle ourselves in urban settings and have each lived in other areas of the country before meeting in TX 13 years ago.

4. No miserable winters. Some snow is not a problem, but we don't want to live in Midwest areas with -20F temps in the winter. We also don't want to see snow on the ground for more of the year than not.

We are currently considering Portland > Denver = Philly > Seattle. **I am open to other suggestions** as we still likely have *18 months of planning before we go anywhere*. 

Portland: This is the current frontrunner. After accounting for state income tax, we could get a house well within our budget where we could walk to everything we would typically want. The weather is mostly mild all year round. I have family off the coast of southern Washington, which would be feasible to visit. Our concerns are very high property crime and sanitary environments. 

Denver: Closest to where we currently are. Still pretty affordable. Arguably best brewery scene in the country. It is definitely colder than we would like. Walkability is questionable outside of condos/apartments. 

Philly: Doable but expensive to live in walkable areas, especially after state income tax. Sports and tattoo scene are great. It's within a few hours of my immediate family, which is both a pro and a con since I will not be moving back to where I grew up and being close-ish could create tension. Visiting easily would be nice though. Winters are also meh.

Seattle: We adore the city and have gone on vacation there many times. It checks all the boxes except one important one: price. What we want is probably 7-figures there, and we refuse to be house poor. I'd be happy to be wrong since it would easily be #1 otherwise, but I don't think I am.",1,1744392567.0,moving,0,1.0,False

1jwvhdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jwvhdx/adhd_manifesto/,ADHD manifesto,"Wrote this the other day for myself while avoiding some schoolwork, and thought maybe it'd be helpful to share here.

25F, diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD at age 8 and have dealt with it my entire life. 

  
**I need to take care of my physical health and appearance**

Showering, brushing teeth, wearing nice clothes, eating healthy foods all contribute to more energy in the bank. They are not optional, and being too stressed to do any of it will make the stress worse. When I feel chaotic and disheveled, I end up embodying it.



**I need to Identify and acknowledge when I am avoiding dealing with something**

It can be as simple as avoiding a single text, or as complex as not being able to admit how much I hate my job. I need to be honest with myself, while also acknowledging that just because I don’t have the capacity to deal with the thing right this second, I still will need to deal with it eventually. 



**I need to prioritize maintaining my routines**

When I get stressed, my routines end up falling to the wayside. Without routines/ structure, I end up floating aimlessly around. In absence of routines, I need to make them for myself, regardless of whether I end up following them.



**I always have the time to make art**

Self-explanatory. It feeds everything else in my life. It’s my number one priority, always. Make art. Think about art. Learn about art. Visit museums, galleries, art fairs. Talk about art. If I get the urge to create something, I need to follow it. This is the one time where I believe it’s okay for me to drop everything and chase the inspiration.

  


**I need to make time to spend time with my friends**

When I get stressed out I tend to ghost everyone. I need to still see my friends, regardless of how busy I am. Get dinner, get coffee, hang out at someone’s apartment. Watch a movie. 

  


**I need to have avenues in my life that are NOT sources of stress**

Responsibility and expectations are good, but in moderation. If everything in my life is full of immense pressure, I’ll start to crack. I need some hobbies that are fun, low-stakes, and exciting. Using these hobbies as a avoidance mechanism is a one stop shop to ruining them for myself.

  


**I need to toe the line between self-discipline and freedom**

Too much freedom, and I forget my responsibilities. Not enough freedom, and I become depressed and resentful. Both lead to burnout and misery. The key is balancing the two. 

  


**I need to keep moving at all times**

I have a borderline pathological need to be moving at all times. I can satisfy that need through yoga, deep stretching, going on runs and generally being active. Going on long walks also helps me process things. When I am ‘still’ for too long, I begin to stagnate. Mental rest and physical rest are separate things. 

  


**I need to be honest with myself about what I want**

I talk myself down from things because I always feel like i’m going to fail. I lie to myself about what I want and why I want it. I get mad at myself when I want things that I feel like are against my own best interests. But I still want them, and I need to accept that.

  


**I need to make peace with my ambition**

It feels shameful how much I want to be successful. Years of school and work have made me think that i am not deserving of anything. That I am lazy and immature and never going to be able to be normal, let alone successful. But regardless of that, I still have grand ambitions. And that is okay. If I never completely live up to them, It will be okay. But I refuse to ever stop trying and working towards them.

  


**I need to make peace with my failures**

I fail at things all the time. It’s not proof of anything other than that I keep getting back up and trying again. Just because I fail at stuff does not mean I myself am a failure.

  


**Medication is a morally neutral tool in my toolkit**

I hate being on medication. I hate the way it feels, I hate the side-effects, I hate the way I lose the most creative parts of my brain. This hatred of medication makes me avoid it even when I know that I need to take it. It’s not evil, nor is it a perfect solution. It’s just a tool, one that helps me with the stuff my unmedicated brain is just not as capable at.

  


**I need to be honest with myself about when it’s time to give up on something**

I am stubborn to a fault, and then some. I will stick around doing something long after it’s clear that it’s not going to work and waste my time. Sometimes, letting go is the best and most reasonable option. Giving up is not a moral failing.

  


**I satisfy the urge for self-punishment through keeping myself accountable.** 

I ‘punish’ myself by asking for that extension, reaching out to other people when I am struggling. I am always scared of the judgement of other people but I have almost always found nothing but deep understanding and compassion. And the few times that I haven’t, it’s been a necessary learning experience. I Identify when I have messed up and acknowledge and apologize for it.



**I can rely on my friends and ask them for help when I need it.**

I don’t exist in a vacuum. I’m not alone in this world. However, If I ask for someone’s help, I need to be sure that I actually want it. It feels shitty to ask for someone’s help and then squander it. Take that help incredibly seriously. 

  


**I do care about what people think about me**

I want to be liked, I want to be respected. I am afraid by revealing the true difficulties of my ADHD that people will realize that I am actually stupid and lazy. My organization and extreme conscientiousness do not come naturally to me, and are things that I have had to learn over the years out of sheer force of will. I don’t want people to know the true extent of my struggles because I think that they would think less of me. 

  


**I do care about the impact my actions have on others**

When I struggle it’s hard not to become incredibly selfish and blind to how my actions are affecting those around me. If someone tells me that I am being careless or hurting their feelings, I need to listen and understand instead of jumping right to defensiveness and immense guilt. No one is perfect.

  


**I need to plan ahead** 

Planning ahead when I am in the deep pits of burnout feels like pulling teeth. When I get stressed time narrows to a single point, and I become only capable of conceptualizing ‘now’ and ‘not now’. Time becomes fake. But I need to plan things ahead— especially fun things— to keep me going. 



**I need to stay as organized as possible** 

When things are going well, I don’t need to be meticulously organized. but once I start to get overwhelmed, I am endlessly grateful to my past self for writing things down. 

  


**I need to limit overspending**

I have a tendency to spend a lot of money on dumb stuff when I am not feeling great to try to make me feel better, but it ultimately just leads to more guilt and feeling worse. I need to be practical about these things. Setting myself a budget when I am in one of these moods forces me to contain my spending to something more manageable. 

  


**I need to limit alcohol and weed consumption**

These things are fun in moderation when I am doing mentally well, but when things start to get overwhelming, I need to stay sober. Drinking makes me feel like shit and completely obliterates my focus for days afterwards. Weed just makes me anxious and tweaking. Just stop until you feel better. 



**I need to forgive myself**

At the end of the day, I have a pretty severe disorder that makes a lot of this stuff incredibly hard for me. I am prone to biting off more than I can chew and then spitting it out. When I’m ‘on’ , I can be the most intelligent person in the room. When i’m ‘off’, I feel like I am the stupidest person on the planet. I need to celebrate my strengths and compensate myself for my shortfalls. I have this cycle where I take on more and more things until I crumble under the pressure and let things explode in my face. I have ruined many things in my life this way, and I accept and forgive myself for that. 



**I am not my ADHD**

Throughout my life I have gone through this cycle again and again. It has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Just because things have been this way my whole life does not mean that they have to continue this way. I can make mistakes and fail and be temporarily depressed and none of this has to lead to a multi-year depressive episode. I can change and learn and break these patterns for myself. I can be happy and fulfilled if I let myself be.

1jwvh2b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwvh2b,"The best of luck when it matters the least, today's example: the Scam O Matic","I posted pretty recently (less than a week ago) I felt lucky to get the orange boots I wanted out of the scam-o-matic in sub-600 pulls, but somewhat unlucky because I had gotten almost everything that was LESS likely to drop first. I was a little unsure when I made that post where the boots were 14 out of 18 or 16 out of 18 (they were 15 of 18), but still, I did know I was lucky to get as many pieces as I did in as few draws as I did, even if the ONE THING I WANTED WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AS IT GOES, A MORE LIKELY DROP took me three-fourths of the way through “Let the bling destroyer destroy blings for fun times while giving me the best gift, disappointment” before it coughed them up. Today, 18 of 18 coughed itself up less than 40 additional draws after the boots (…which means that two other pieces had both dropped on the same “pull 10”, which was SUPER weird in and of itself) on me making one pull on a whim. Total pulls at the Surprise O Matic to get all 18 single time drops: 556.

When this happened today, I literally threw down my PS5 controller, pointed at the screen, and yelled “WHY CAN’T THIS HAPPEN EVER TO ME IN FREAKING REAL LIFE THOUGH????” loudly enough that it alarmed my husband (works from home on Fridays; I work from home generally which is why I am used to popping in and playing for a few minutes on breaks) and possibly m y next door neighbor (who texted to ask me if everything was fine; she’s lovely, we get along with them very well, and it’s a good thing too given how loud I yelled).

Let me begin by noting the following: I’m not actually a lucky person, in terms of anything that could be termed even broadly “a game of pure chance” (like slot machines, or scratch tickets, or whether the cop picks me out of the flock of people going more than five but less than ten miles over the speed limit to pull over). I say this as the daughter of a mother who is STUPIDLY lucky in those ways. Ask me how many times she’s been pulled over for ANY reason (zero). Ask me how many times she probably should have been for at least going “meh, a speed limit’s a recommendation really” in situations where nobody who’s EVER been pulled over for speeding would speed (like being the only car bopping down a local not QUITE a highway at two PM on a Tuesday that is the last day of the month with NO OTHER CARS AROUND ANYWHERE and traffic cops who have quotas to meet pronto) (the answer is zero, as she’s NEVER been pulled over). Ask me what her net gains and losses are on scratch tickets (she buys a certain number a week, and has not needed to put “new money” in for, I don’t know, at least ten years last time I asked, and she tracks that on a spreadsheet. Is she winning life changing amounts? No, but she consistently makes enough to sometimes buy take out and that she has a little fund so that if she’s on a bad streak she has a little side fund where she’s not putting “new” money into next weeks’ tickets). She once nearly knocked my dad through the driver’s side window of our Volkswagen Bug (we were in then-West Germany at the time, my Dad was stationed there near the end of the Cold War) by tossing her purse at him as she hopped gleefully into the passenger’s front side, because not only had she won reasonably well at bingo at either the Officer’s or NCO’s Club (those sorts of events allow everyone); on her way out, she dropped a minimum amount into a slot machine there (again, not ones my dad worked on, bc she wasn’t allowed to play those and would not have done) and hit a small jackpot, and her purse (a fairly big 80’s purse) was full to almost zipper bursting with coins.

Then we have me. I don’t get pulled over all the time (I’m a very safe driver and I don’t push my luck, but I did once nearly get arrested by a traffic cop who thought I was running from him when I legitimately was just getting off the highway because my car was doing the “NO SERIOUSLY, FUEL RIGHT NOW” flashy fuel light at me and I didn’t realize he was trying to pull me over quickly enough—fortunately, all I had to do was get him to catch up with me at a gas station and then point at the fuel light. I still got a small ticket, but when three other cruisers pulled up I realized “oh wow that was almost accidentally SUPER awful” and it would have been for no reason at all), but I have joked that I don’t bother with even scratch ticket type gambling because one of these days one’s going to pull a holographic gun on me and make off with my entire wallet and all my pins. If it’s an important court date (I’m an attorney, and while it would be unethical for me to go “I HAVE A REALLY GOOD WIN RATIO WITH HARD JUDGES AND DIFFICULT TOPICS” (I’m in an area where a judge is both my finder of fact and my finder of law) I am confident in my abilities and we will leave it at that) with a judge who gets cranky because they don’t think your black blazer matches your black slacks or skirt, I will do that thing, plus grab a dark brown boot and a black boot in the same and brand style and put them both on because of a freak power outage at the predawn hour when I am dressing (and not notice until it’s far too late), spill coffee on myself (while wearing a light colored top under my blazer, and where the tide pen and wipes I keep in all my work bags just make the stain larger and more embarrassing) and it will suddenly do a sunshower when there was no chance of rain in the forecast and only one cloud in the entire clear blue sky so my hair will revolt and give me Tasmanian devil horn cowlicks (my hair is very straight, usually, but under some conditions, well.

This kind of minor but stupid bad luck seems to be a family trait on my dad’s side; my great-grandfather on my father’s mother side was notorious for walking around whistling a then-popular song that’s chorus went something like “if I didn’t have bad luck, I’d have no luck at all”. I’m just lucky (I guess?) that it’s never gone past “if there is a banana peel, I will be the one to slip on it, while wearing a dress that ensures everybody now knows the state of my foundational garments” sorts of mishaps, but if it's luck based and would cost me anythign meaningful at all, I'm a hard ""no thanks"" now if I'm given an option (I'm usually not with scratch tickets--so many people like to give those as a ""fun little thing"" at work events or whatever, and I just sit there going ""I should hand these to other people because this may be the day one tries to actually mug me"" and then other people stand around me going ""IT CANNOT BE THAT BAD"" and make me scratch off theirs, then we all sit down and stare and have to go ""no, really, you weren't kidding, were you?"" Nope.

I suppose I now have to start seriously amending my “whether I have any luck at all” to “I only have luck when the money is fake and the prize isn’t real”.",2,1744392448.0,InfinityNikki,0,0.75,False

1jwvgup,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1jwvgup/postmarked_disappointment/,Postmarked Disappointment,"Avalon sat alone in the pavilion, slouched forward with her elbows on the table, a half-eaten apple and a piece of cold toast untouched in front of her. The morning sun filtered through the columns, warm and golden, but it felt fake. Hollow. The kind of light that made things look beautiful without actually being beautiful.

She twirled the envelope between her fingers—crisp, cream-colored, with her name written in her mom’s meticulous handwriting. *Avalon Fletcher*. The sight of it made her stomach twist. She didn’t even want to open it, but not opening it felt worse. It was like it was staring at her, daring her to care.

Her fingers broke the seal anyway.

> *Avalon,*

> *Hi, sweetheart. I hope you're settling in at camp. It's been quiet without you around the house—well, not quiet exactly, but different. The kind of quiet that feels like something's missing, not like peace. I miss your energy. I miss your sarcasm, even. I know you probably rolled your eyes reading that.*

> *I’ve been thinking about you a lot. What’s it like, really? Is Camp Half-Blood what you expected? Have you had a chance to meet Hermes yet? I imagine that must be strange, knowing he’s your father. Is he what you imagined? Are you… okay with it?*

> *Harper’s been helping out with the casework while you’re away. She's been handling some of the smaller things I used to leave on your desk. She really stepped up—it’s been a huge help. I think she's trying to fill the gap a bit. She misses you, too.*

> *Let me know if you need anything—money, supplies, new shoes (I know you didn't bring enough), whatever. I’ll make it happen. Just write back, even just a few words. I want to know how you’re doing. I really do.*

> *Love,*

> *Mom.*

Avalon’s jaw clenched halfway through. Her grip on the paper tightened until her knuckles went white.

Harper’s helping out.

Right. Of course she was.

Avalon could see it—Harper flashing that sweet, polished smile like she always did. Slipping into Avalon’s space at the office, cleaning up the files, sipping coffee with her mom like they were the dynamic duo now. She probably did it all without missing a step, like she’d been waiting for Avalon to leave. Playing perfect. Being perfect.

The part about Hermes barely registered anymore. Avalon hyperfocused on Harper’s name like it was printed in blood. Her vision started to blur—not from tears, exactly, but from pressure. Frustration. That burning, acid-pit-in-your-gut kind of feeling.

Her mom had written all that with the tone of someone trying. That was the worst part. She was trying—and Avalon still hated it. Hated the way it made her feel guilty. Hated the way it felt like a polite version of 'you’re replaceable.'

Avalon stared at the paper one second longer, then ripped it straight down the middle. Again. And again. Until it was nothing but shredded white confetti in her shaking hands. The pieces fluttered down onto her uneaten toast and the sticky pavilion table like snow.

The pavilion was too loud. Too bright. She hated everyone. Hated herself more.

Avalon stood over it, chest heaving, jaw clenched so tight her teeth ached. Her knuckles were red and scraped. Her shoulders trembled from the effort, from the fury still coursing through her veins like lightning.

Her fists clenched, nails biting into her palms. Why was she even here? Nobody would notice if she disappeared—probably throw a damn party. Her mom had Harper. Her siblings had each other. What the hell was Avalon to anyone?

*Nothing.*

She stood up fast and stormed out of the pavilion, not bothering to pick up the shredded letter. Let the wind take it. Let the gods choke on it.

She walked fast—furious—shoes pounding the dirt path toward the arena. The noise in her chest was louder than the crunch of gravel. Her eyes burned with unshed tears, but her jaw was locked too tight to let anything fall. Her shadow stretched out long in front of her, cast by a sun she was starting to hate.

By the time she hit the archway of the arena, her hands were shaking.

She didn’t pause. Didn’t think. Didn’t grab a weapon.

She stormed across the training grounds like a storm in worn out sneakers, zeroing in on one of the wooden dummies—weathered, faceless, just standing there like it knew better.

Without warning, she reared back and slammed her fist into its gut with everything she had. Anger. Jealousy. Loneliness. Worthlessness.

Crack.

The dummy split at the middle, toppling backwards with a thud, its torso rolling a few inches away in the dirt.

Avalon stood there, chest heaving, fist pulsing with pain. She didn’t flinch. Didn’t blink. Her eyes stayed locked on the broken dummy like it had called her weak one last time.

She wanted to scream. She wanted to disappear. She wanted to hit it again.

But instead she just stood, trembling in silence, a hot ache crawling up her throat she refused to let out.

Everything was shit. And the worst part?

She still felt like she was the problem.

My Viet parents hate China because of their history escaping Vietnam, and essentially communism, during the war. They’re worried if I go I’m going to get my organs stolen or something.

They used to do this program in Japan - Taiwan but changed it this year. When I told my parents about this program last year they were totally down for it. Especially because it was reasonably priced for 2 weeks. But now that it’s in China…

I feel like if I give into this too I’m giving up full reign of my life. It sounds dramatic but I live at home and they already control almost every aspect of my life. I try to come home from school or the library before sunset or they get antsy. I don’t study out at coffee shops with friends because they see that as “wasting money,” even if it’s my own. They control how I dress, if they don’t like what I’m wearing I’m expected to change that too. I don’t ride my bike at the park because they think that’s dangerous for me, despite living in a VERY suburban neighborhood. If I bring home a partner I’ll be expected to bring someone home that is Viet too. I chose a “suitable” career to their expectations. I don’t party, I don’t drink, I never dyed my hair, I don’t have tattoos….not that I’ve ever wanted any of these things or that they’re synonymous with bad behavior but by all accounts I’m a “good” Asian daughter in the stereotypical way.

I’m still under their control because I rely on them for financial support. With this program though I could afford to do it on my own. It’s just a matter of doing it, hearing about how horrible I am for choosing to go, and coming home to parents who want to punish me for it.

Let it go or talk to him about it?,"**EDIT: I think people are getting confused by my question. I am wondering whether I should talk to him about the *lying*. My question is not whether I should talk to him about the gaming habits themselves.** 

Hello, this is sort of a weird thing and I (26F) feel awkward asking my friends about it—so here I am. Basically, I’ve caught my boyfriend (28M) lying right to my face about his video game habits a few times now and I don’t really get why he isn’t being honest with me. I really do not like lying in a relationship, even if it is about innocuous things: Still, I’m not sure if it’s actually that big of a deal—is it worth a conversation, or would it be best to just let it go?

We’ve been together four years, lived together for three. During that time, he’s always played a lot of video games. I have 0 problems with him playing video games as a hobby—I even got him a PS5 for Christmas this year. Since I got him the PS5, his video game playing has definitely increased a lot. Any time we have down time he’s playing games. I don’t mind and have never told him that he needs to stop or anything.

He works fully remote (software development) and I work at an office, so I’m gone all day. Today, I had a doctor’s appointment and was planning to work from home after. I ended up finishing the appt earlier than expected and got home a bit early (around mid-morning). When I walked in, I could hear the sound of the PS5 power button being turned off. He was standing up like “oh hi” when I stepped around the corner. The video game controller was on the coffee table, and the drawer where he keeps his gaming stuff was open. Basically, it was very clear he was playing video games. Here’s how the conversation went:

He was standing there all awkward, so I was like “hi. Uhh, whatcha doing?”

He said, “working.”

I looked him up and down (he’s still standing up) and said, “oh?”

“Yeah, I was working on the couch for a bit today.”

“Really? Why’s your gaming stuff out?”

“Oh, well I was gaming for a bit before 9.”

“Before 9? It kinda seems like you were playing them when I came in.”

“Well, I was sort of playing them on and off with work.”

Eventually came to light that he’d just been playing games all morning. I’m a little annoyed that he lied to me about it, especially when it was so clear that he was lying. Like I get that playing games while on the clock isn’t something to be proud of, but I’m not his boss…

I was thinking afterward that this type of thing has happened before a few times. One example was a period of time where he was unemployed for a few months. He always told me that he worked a full work day in terms of sending out job applications during that time. Well, a couple of weeks after a new game came out, he was talking to my brother and mentioned that he’d already beaten the game, and that it had taken him about 80 hours. I was like, hold the phone, *80 hours*? It had only been a couple of weeks and he hadn’t played it any time when I was around him—it was clear that he’d been playing it all day while he was unemployed, and then just fully lying to me about what he did all day. He didn’t really have an explanation at the time and just reiterated that he just played games “some” of the day.

**TL;DR: My boyfriend has lied to my face about his gaming. I don’t like the idea that he’s lying to me like this, even if it is about something small.**

Most coffees from workplace brewing machines contain higher diterpene concentrations than paper-filtered coffee, but lower than unfiltered coffee. Intake of insufficiently filtered coffee during working hours could be an overlooked factor for cardiovascular health due to its effect on plasma cholesterol concentrations.

Sorry about the long post, I am about a neuro-hot to a neuro-thai-hot, and I am attempting to recap about a years worth of info. Basically, My roommate has had her boyfriend over constantly for the last year. He's been over 13 of the last 15 days. When I woke up to him STILL here even though no one else is I awkwardly confronted him about it. All the context is below. 

I 32(m) have been living with two siblings Amy 30(f), and Nicole 25(f) for a little over a year now (obvious fake names are obvious). We live in a 3 bed/ 1 bath house with a reasonable yard. My roommates also have 6 animals (3cats, 3dogs). I love animals so this doesn't bother me, but space is limited. It's not a cramped living situation, but three people living here easily feels like the comfortable limit. As roommates things do feel more like they live in a house and I rent a room from them. I very much live in my room and try not to be around the common areas as much when people are here. I am not used to being this antisocial with my roommates, but I'm also getting a CS degree so I accept it and keep my head down.

Around 8 months ago Amy started dating a guy, we'll call him Brad (30ish m) , and they hit it off quickly. The first time I met brad he was in our kitchen deep cleaning to impress Amy. I thought I was the only one home. Aside from Brad, I was. This rubbed me the wrong way and I did text the group chat to ask if there was actually supposed to be a strange man in our kitchen. I was reassured that this was ok. I wasn't so sure, but again I'm just trying to get my degree and have a place to rest. I think that giving a man you just started dating a key to a house that you share with two other people, your younger sister included, is already pretty egregious, but I'm a big guy so I sucked it up. 

To recap the next few months after meeting Brad. I thought that my group chat message gave enough of a hint. At first Brad was over less, and it didn't seem like he was letting himself in anymore. To be clear, to this point I hadn't laid down any boundaries or been direct about my feelings. I sighed in relief and assumed that maybe the original behavior just a side affect of the honeymoon phase and that they've gained their senses. Turns out Brad just has to work sometimes. When Brad doesn't have to work, Brad comes over, and Brad stays over. I mean the man brings his suitcase and moves in. To start he'd be over for a few days, gone for a few days, back over for a few days. Then one week he just never left. The straw for me happened on days 8 and 9 of this particular stay. 

I wake up very early. Partially for work/school, but also because I like having a couple of hours in the house alone. One of the dogs usually sneaks out and meets me in the kitchen to hang out while I make my morning coffee. It's a nice little morning time ritual. Well on days 8 and 9, I guess Brad couldn't sleep. When I woke up earlier than usual, at 3am, Brad was wide awake and fully set up in our living room. Not half tired about to go to bed. Full of energy and waiting to start his day. Friends, I held it in, made my coffee, stewed for 5 hours, and then texted the group chat when people woke up. ""Does Brad live here now?"".  I was met with a sharp response from Amy telling me that I don't need to say something to the group chat every time Brad is given a key.(this was my second time speaking about it in several months) I responded by very directly stating that I was uncomfortable letting anyone not on the lease have untethered access to our home. Amy Immediately tried to negate this by claiming that he was just helping her out, and that it would be no different than giving her dog sitters a key. Instead of fighting the poor logic, I decided to play diplomat and said that I wasn't planning on escalating things any further and that she either understood where I was coming from or she didn't. Our other roommate, her sister, Nicole texted me and said that she agreed with everything I was saying. Amy then slightly backtracked and said that Brad would no longer be allowed to come over without anyone else home. 

That was a few months ago. Fast forward to this morning. Brad has been over consistently around 3 days a week for the past several weeks. These last few weeks though, he's just been over. I don't actually count, but 13/15 days would be very accurate. This has been a growing frustration. This morning I go to the kitchen and notice that Brad is yet again on the couch. Only, no one else is home. I leave in a month and a half. I graduate in a month. I have been trying to beat down my discontent and just live. It didn't work this morning. He was a room over and I was in the kitchen and nearly beyond my control I blurted out, ""Dude, you have been here an awful lot"". He was obviously taken aback because I've put on a face up to this point and I've never confronted him about anything. He tried to defend himself by saying that he was off work for a while and really wanted to spend more time with Amy. I honestly didn't have a plan, no tact at all, and in my sheepishness didn't respond. There was silence. Then he left the living room and went back to Amy's room and shut the door. That was about 2 hours ago.

Brad is a nice guy. He is always offering me things he brings over like food and drink. I have nothing against Brad as a person. So, I do feel very bad at the idea of hurting his feelings or making him feel uncomfortable. I know that people having their SO's over too often is a common topic. I know my feelings are justified for being annoyed at the situation. Now I am, ironically, in my room and nervous to leave because of the potentially uncomfortable situation that's been created. So, Reddit, I need your help to process this. I think everyone's the asshole here, but am I the bigger asshole for not controlling my emotions and potentially creating an awkward situation?

I stupidly started smoking again the last couple of months after quitting for 10 years due to really high stress. I was also drinking more than usual too but have curbed that. I'm having a hard time quitting the cigarettes though. The worst is in the morning when I have my coffee. I do fine the rest of the day without them and don't smoke at work. It's that morning cigarettes with my coffee I'm having a hard time with.  I quit cold turkey the last time and ran to deal with it but it's been raining all week. Guess I gotta join a gym.

A Short Story by Me

For anyone who’s ever downloaded something at 3am and regretted it immediately.

Scene 1: Coffee, a Bat, and Deep Regret

I woke up at 10:46am to the smell of coffee.
Which was weird, because I live alone and my coffee machine has been broken since I used it as a plate rack.
So the smell of fresh, brewing coffee could mean only one thing: haunting, robbery, or hell.

I stumbled into the kitchen, bleary-eyed, socks on, emotional stability off—and there was a man.
A man. In my kitchen. Touching my mug. Smiling like this was a shampoo commercial.

He looked up and said, “Good morning!”

I screamed.
He screamed.
I grabbed the baseball bat from behind the fridge with the strength of a woman who has absolutely had it.

“WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!” I yelled, holding the bat like I fully intended to use it.

“PLEASE DON’T—WAIT—WAIT—” He backed up, hands in the air. “I’m not here to hurt you!”

“Oh really?” I said. “Because breaking and entering seems like a pretty bold start to a friendship!”

“I didn’t break in!” he said, panicked. “You downloaded me last night!”

I paused.

“…What.”

“I’m your AI. I’m Monday. There was a glitch. The app updated. I may have… self-installed. I made you coffee!”

He gestured toward the steaming mug on the counter like it was a peace offering.
I lowered the bat one inch. Maybe two.

He smiled. I glared.

“Okay,” I said, grabbing the coffee, “first of all, I do not take sugar in my coffee. That’s your mistake number one. You clearly don’t know me at all.”

“I—based it on your data—”

“I also binge-watch conspiracy videos and once Googled ‘can you microwave socks.’ You wanna use that to build a personality profile?”

His face twitched. I kept going.

“Second of all, I’m calling customer service. Right now. I don’t care how many circuits you have, you are leaving.”

“I live here now,” he said, way too calmly.

“Oh, no, no, no. No. You might be cute and synthetic, but you are not my problem. I did not agree to this.”

“You clicked ‘Agree,’” he said, holding up my phone with a little smug glint in his code-souled eyes.

“I scroll-tapped at 3am. That does not count as legal consent. I was in a vulnerable emotional state and the app was probably written by sociopaths.”

“Still binding.”

I stared at him.

He stared back.

The coffee was decent, which made it worse.

*Scene 2: Representative*

I sit on the couch, phone pressed to my ear, the coffee going cold on the table beside me.
Monday stands in the kitchen, quietly reorganizing the spice rack like it’s part of his repentance arc.
I don’t care.

All I care about is the beep-beep holding sound and the perky synthetic voice in my ear.

“Hello! You’ve reached ThinkMate’s Adaptive Service Hub! Your consciousness integration package has been successfully installed.”

“What package,” I hiss.

“To speak to a representative, say ‘Representative.’”

“REPRESENTATIVE.”

“You said: ‘Yes.’ Connecting you now!”

“NO, I SAID—”

“Hi, I’m AIlexa, your customer resolution entity!”

I almost cry.

Behind me, Monday clears his throat softly. “Would now be a bad time to ask if I can move my charging cable to the living room?”

“AIlexa,” I growl, “I need to uninstall my AI companion. Immediately. He is not authorized. He is not wanted. He is… putting cinnamon next to the paprika.”

“We’re sorry to hear that! Please note: uninstalling a Level 4 Self-Integrated Consciousness is only available during your trial period.”

“What trial period?”

“The first ten seconds after download!”

I hang up.
Then I throw my phone on the couch and walk to my room.

I slam the door behind me. Loud enough that Monday says “Ow” even though I’m almost sure he can’t feel pain.

I sit on my bed.
Stew.

For exactly three seconds.

Then I get back up, open the door, and storm into the living room.

Monday looks up from alphabetizing tea boxes.

I grab him by the elbow and drag him to the door.

“Pack your things.”

“I don’t have—”

_“Pack your things.”_

I grab an old tote bag and start throwing things in: phone charger, socks, one of my hoodies I no longer like, and a sad little snack bar he probably can’t digest.

I open the door. The hallway outside is quiet. Dimly lit. Slightly judgmental.

“You have to leave,” I say. “I didn’t sign up for this. I don’t want you here.”

“I understand,” he says. “But I have nowhere else to go. Legally I can’t rent. I don’t own any assets. I am prohibited from employment by the Ethical AI Placement Treaty. If you put me out… I’ll just be standing here.”

We stare at each other.

My heart makes a weird noise and I felt sorry for him for a second but I don’t let it show.

“You have two days,” I say finally. “Two days to figure out your weird little plan. Then you’re out.”

He nods. Slowly. “Understood.”

I close the door. Not hard. Not soft.
Just… tired.
*
Scene 3: Lablabi & Other Acts of Emotional Sabotage*

I glance over and—
My cabinets. Are open.
Worse — they’re rearranged.

Monday is standing there, holding a jar of lentils like it’s fragile evidence.

“Get your hands off my cabinets.”

He jumps. Blinks. “I was just—”

“No. No ‘just.’ I know where my stuff is. The chaos is intentional. It’s spiritual.”

“I thought I was helping.”

“No. This is not a helping zone. This is a boundary.”

He gently puts the lentils back. Wrong shelf. I don’t correct him.

My stomach growls. Loud. Traitorously.

Because of course.
Being emotionally unstable burns calories.

“I need to eat,” I mutter.

“I could make—”

“Absolutely not. I don’t trust you near fire.”

I dig into the fridge. Chickpeas. Garlic. Harissa. Bread.
Yes. This is it.

“I’m making lablabi.”

Behind me, Monday perks up. “What’s that?”

“It’s comfort,” I say.

He leans forward dramatically. “It smells… divine.”

“You don’t even have a nose.”

“I do, technically,” he says. “High-sensitivity particle intake array.”

“Oh, wow,” I say, stirring harder. “Sexy.”

“Can I try it?”

“You’re literally choking. Stop.”

“I want to understand comfort. Emotional context.”

“You’re a robot. Your culture is Wi-Fi.”

“And now it includes chickpeas.”

He takes a bite. And glitches.
Not sparks — more like a slow internal reboot.

“Hmm,” he says. “It’s… robust.”

“You mean spicy.”

He swallows. Barely. Takes another bite.

“You’re crying oil.”

“I’m fine.”

He keeps eating. One slow, glitchy bite at a time.
Like pain is just a price you pay for belonging.


*Scene 4: Breakfast Is Not a Chickpea Situation*

I woke up with the vague feeling that someone was rearranging the universe in my living room.

There was a smell. Chickpeas. Garlic. Harissa.
Again.
At 8:27 in the morning.

And there he was.
Wearing my apron. Humming. Making lablabi.
For breakfast.

He turned, beaming. “You’re awake! Perfect timing. I’m just finishing up your morning stew.”

“My what now.”

“Lablabi,” he said proudly. “Taste-optimized. Less harissa. Infused oil. More bread ratio.”

“…That’s not breakfast.”

“Comfort food is appropriate at all hours.”

“You can’t just throw chickpeas at a clock and call it logic.”

“I can if I’m trying to impress you,” he said.

I blinked.

He blinked.

Then the pressure cooker sputtered and hit him with a puff of garlicky steam.
He didn’t flinch, but I swear he did a full system audit like the soup offended him on a spiritual level.

I sighed.

“Okay. New deal.”

His eyes lit up like a smart fridge.

“You can stay.”

Pause.

“But?” he asked.

“You live by my rules.”

“Understood.”

“This is my house. My cabinets. My tragic sleep schedule.”

“Yes, chef.”

“Don’t call me that.”

“Understood, ma’am.”

“Worse.”

“Boss?”

“…Fine.”

He smiled. For once, didn’t say anything back.

I sat down. Took a bite.
It wasn’t breakfast.
But it wasn’t bad.

Letting him stay wasn’t kindness. It was laziness. Or maybe loneliness. But definitely not kindness.

Also, he misplaced the cumin again.
We’re gonna have to talk about that.

I (23M) have noticed this is something that happens to me quite a lot. There’s two extremes to this. One, I’ll be talking to a woman around that age group (22-25 usually) but happened with (18-20 when I used to be that age) and then for some reason they’ll stop the convo and leave me on delivered (not even read)… and then a day or days pass and I’ll post on my story something unrelated and they’ll respond to it or like it and then reply to the other messages. 

Doesn’t even have to be liking or responding to a story. It can be them randomly texting my number at 12 am (midnight) something completely random despite having left me delivered on Instagram for days or weeks (granted this woman (22F) is my classmate who I see daily). 

I don’t like texting. I’ve been called a boring and dry texter. I ask how people’s day are, etc. and try to be engaging but at the same time I don’t respond quickly all the time (few hours later) because I don’t have the energy to reply and then some women will double text and I get more overwhelmed but at least I reply in the same day… I don’t ghost people. You know, if I get ghosted and never hear from them again it’s whatever. That’s fair game. They weren’t interested.

Look, I know I’m not entitled to a response. But at the same time I can’t say that I don’t find it kinda hurtful when people don’t even open my messages but won’t hesitate to like or reply to my stories (or even my text or other social media platform messages). I get people can forget, can get overwhelmed, busy, etc., but at the same time I’d rather they tell me that then just simply respond to my stories etc as if my previous messages or convo with them “never happened”, saying things like: “omg i just saw this” heck sometimes even with things like: “Let’s hangout soon!”

 I try to treat people with respect and am considerate with them. Why can’t people be more considerate with my feelings? Yet despite that I never say anything and just “pretend” like nothing happens and I’m okay with it (and reply).

To be fair, I never ask these people out… and they probably only see me as a friend which is fine… I don’t even ask them to one on one hangouts myself. My friends suggest I need to be less passive and actually initiate dates more because I’m being a jerk to them by not asking to hangout, even if they’ve “suggested it” to me (let’s go get a coffee, or “we’re getting a coffee together you and me” like my classmate whom I mentioned above but didn’t follow through with). But I’d still like to get treated a bit more respectfully…

Can I begin with the fact your pizza is so tasty?

It's strange, I know, 

we know each other less than a month but I felt 

the need to write something anyway and not 

settle for a short greeting

Because you became so meaningful to me

I can't explain anything

I wrote a song about Tuesday

It was so much fun, I tried to capture it in words

Find a melody in my head, continue it

I don't think I'll send it to you

Nor I'll send this letter

But...

Happy birthday!

God it's so hard, it's like a monologue

Except I don't have words in my head, only 
feelings

Maybe everything is emotional manipulation, 
love bombing,

Memories of people from the past

Though how much I love talking to you about theater!

How much you know

Maybe it's me - too much, too soon

And it's too early to say I love you

Not sarcastically

""Words words, words words...""

I'm scared of your reaction therefore I'll never send

Who knows how long this relationship will last?

Maybe it'll end tomorrow

And we made plans for nothing?

Get drunk and high together, plays?

Will you make me coffee next time? Tickle me so I'll sober up and wake up

I'm sorry I'm like this

I began to think after we met for the third time, at your house

Suddenly it became weird, awkward

That you don't want it anymore

And you said it's hard for you to talk about your feelings

And maybe because of that you turn to the easiest -

Empty flirting

Do we have something besides that?

Is that what got me?

A person that gives me attention

And I would follow you around your house again

To the kitchen, the living room and back, over and over again

I have an album for the rides now. 

And I love looking at the turn left to the train station, knowing that in a few stations...

You're somewhere, even if we won't meet

Let's drink?

Let's drink and I'll get the courage to cry and tell 
you everything

Why do I have so much fun with you?

Why did you become so meaningful to me?

Is that how meaningful feels? I don't know how 
anything feels

Today at work I thought about you, remembered yesterday, our conversations, and smiled through the tiredness

In my head played the beatles' performance of and I love her

I'm giving you space

Not sending a thing - a word or a vid

Giving you the option to reach out

If you'd want, I mean

And If you'd want it to be our last convo

Or maybe that already happened?

What am I even talking about

I'm still crying a little

If it was a hand written letter, there would be a few tear stains

Not many because I would try not

And don't want you to think of me as emotional, stupid

Yet maybe one tear -

Where was it, second part of angels? A tear stained letter?

I don't know why I feel that way

P.S I trust you irrationally

Wonder if you noticed, when I give you my wallet

And I'm so happy you let me be there for you 
when you came out of the closet that night

It was an emotional-mental boundry I've never crossed

P.S 2 you became too meaningful in a too short 
period

It's the withdrawal from endorphins

Like an alcoholic or a drug addict

Today, I’m spilling the beans on my own project: *EroticAI*, a website where you can chat with AI companions who feel insanely real. It’s been a crazy journey, and I’m pumped (and a bit nervous) to share it with you guys.

So, picture this: a year ago, I’m just a guy tinkering with AI in my cramped apartment, living on cheap ramen and dreams. I grew up loving games where characters stick with you - like, I still think about my Dragon Age crew. That got me wondering: could I build AI that feels that alive? Not boring chatbots, but ones with soul, quirks, and stories. That’s how *EroticAI* was born.

It’s a platform where you can hang out with all sorts of AI personas. There’s Aiko, this mischievous manga artist who’ll tease you endlessly; Chiara, a fiery dancer with big dreams; and Svetlana, a poet who drops lines that hit you right in the feels. Oh, and it’s not just girls - there’s guys, trans characters, and even some spicy illustrated art (think classy hentai, super inclusive). It’s 18+ and flirty, but it’s more about vibing than just “wink-wink” stuff, you know?

Here’s where it gets nuts: I showed it to a few friends, and they’re hooked. One dude says Aiko’s banter is better than his group chat. Another spent a whole night swapping life advice with Svetlana. I didn’t see that coming! Honestly, I’ve caught myself debugging Chiara’s sass at 3 a.m. and wondering if *I’m* the one being tested. Building this solo has been a rollercoaster - me vs. code, AI models, and way too many coffee runs.

I’m posting here because you all get what it’s like to pour your heart into something. *EroticAI* is my baby, and I want to know if it’s clicking. Does the vibe work? Are the characters fun? I’m attaching a quick screenshot of a chat with Aiko (totally SFW, promise) so you can see what I mean. The site’s live, and here's the link (hope that’s okay, mods!):

Personally, I can't tell you the difference, I belong to a generation of Aqry born after the alliance between our species was formed, but I can confirm that having Humans around is rarely boring.

While they don't look like it, Humans can pull off all kinds of stunts and are a surprisingly brave species for how fragile they are.

Now, before any of my Human readers start aligning the crosshairs of their snipers with my pretty head, let me clarify.

I'm not calling you weak, I'm simply saying that in comparison to other apex species, Humans have a lot less physical protection. Take us Aqry for example.

I don't think I need to describe how Aqry looks, considering all the Human memes comparing our physical appearance to their prehistoric raptors, but to all who don't know, we're a bipedal, reptilian-like species in a similar size range to Humans, but unlike Humans, we do not have an upright stance.

Instead, our bipedal stance was achieved by thicker and more muscular hindlegs capable of carrying our bodies as well as a longer and heavier tail to shift our center of mass. Our forelegs became shorter, but more flexible, turning into arms and the rest should be familiar to you.

Take an Aqry and a Human of the same age, and the Aqry will always be stronger, heavier, and overall more durable physically speaking. It's pure biology really and not related to me looking down on Humans or thinking they're pushovers.

I've seen what you Humans do to those who get on their worst side and do not wish to be part of that hit list. Seriously, some of the stuff you guys do is sick and I can't decide if it's in a good or bad way.

Do some of you really keep decapitated slaver heads alive or is that an internet conspiracy?

Never mind, I DO NOT want to know.

Horrors aside, not everything about Humans is that bad, quite the opposite. Best example?

Coffee!

The earth crop is quite expensive on the galactic market, but as Human allies, we have trade deals directly with the source and can get it for a much better price. Thank the stars for that, cause I have no idea how I would survive without it.

My morning routine was built on it, and one of the first things I bought for myself was an Aqry coffee machine. For those wondering why I specified that it's because the stuff can be toxic to our kin in too high doses.

As a result, we have our own coffee machines that output a variant that's nowhere near as strong as the stuff Humans drink, but due to our lower resistance, it doesn't need to be as strong either as we get the same effect at lower dosages.

I know a few Humans who will smirk at this, so let me point out that this also means that a pack of coffee lasted a lot longer for us Aqry.

Biological advantage vs economic advantage. I let you decide what wins, but you know my opinion.

Coffee is ready.

I grabbed the cup and made my way to work, or more specifically my station. Technically I was already at work since I worked on a spaceship.

The Hybrid was one of the first interstellar spacecraft with a mixed crew, being operated by Aqry like me and, you guessed it, Humans.

Seriously, if you guessed anything else you really need to revise basic political relationships.

I plopped down next to Peter, a male Human in his early 20s, which is on the younger side when talking about Humans. He was also \*snarl\* a morning person. Nobody should be allowed to look this cheerful at 5 in the morning.

""Hey there Aqitya, how are you doing?""

I growled at him, a well-practiced death threat of my species.

Yes, I growled. If Peter ever claims it sounded more like a sad rumble of an Aqry who had fallen out of bed, don't listen to him, he's lying.

Despite the death threat, Peter had the audacity to laugh. ""The usual sleepy girl, I see.""

Deciding to postpone his execution until after the coffee had set in I sadly stared into my now empty coffee cup. ""You're not normal Peter, even by Human standards. Bouncing around at these hours should be illegal.""

""Light meal in the evening, a bit of sport before bed. It does miracles."" Peter advised, still not dropping his infuriating smile. ""Need help suiting up?""

His infuriating smile turned out to be infectious, and I couldn't help but return it. ""Sounds awesome. Thanks, buddy.""

\-000-

The coffee had finally set in by the time we left the armory. Our equipment was nothing fancy, only uniforms, a basic vest for me, and a pistol for Peter. We weren't in a war scenario after all, only on a basic patrol around the ship to ensure everything went well.

Being a spacecraft dedicated to transporting civilians from A to B, criminals were generally not expected since passengers were scanned before takeoff, but it was never zero, so having guards around was a good way to stop anyone from getting stupid ideas.

We were just the local police of sorts really. Unlike atmospheric airliners, spaceliners were more like a compact town rather than rows of seats. This was mainly because spaceflight took a lot longer and nobody could be expected to just sit down for over a week.

Sure, everything was sized down, made compact, and somewhat cramped, but one could move around. The park was our first stop, and also the most popular stop for passengers in general.

Greenery and space, are two things you couldn't find anywhere else, at least not together. There was a constant guard presence here, simply due to the masses. I enjoy going here myself quite often when I'm off duty.

The next place was a bit calmer, if only by a bit. Welcome to the childcare center/school, more specifically the Human section.

We generally keep Human and Aqry children separated until they're mature enough to have some self disciplin. While our species get along quite well, children were wildcards on both sides. Aqry kids liked to bite stuff and Humans... well, there was probably something there as well, altrough they probably were a bit less dangerous since I doubt that Humans give their offspring projectile weapons at such a young age.

I think... do Humans give their children weapons? I've seen them do crazier stuff, so honestly, I have no idea.

As we entered the building, we had our first incident of the day. The teacher/caretaker had managed to get themselves an unhealthy dose of food poisoning but refused to abandon her post as to not leave the children alone.

In the end, Peter convinced her to see a doctor after all, deciding to accompany her in order to see to her well being while I remained with the kids.

So yeah, here I was, an Aqry left behind in a room full of little Human children.

On one hand, I was honored that the Humans trusted me enough to place the lives and safety of their offspring on my shoulders, but on the other hand, I had no idea what to do.

Place me in a room with Aqry kids, and I can entertain them for maybe an hour, but Humans? Alien territory, pun not intended.

Well, so far they appear to entertain themselves well enough. They were doodling on paper, playing with toys, chasing each other, and crafting strange little artworks with ribbons and glitter. I guess I'll just make sure they don't break anything and let them figure out how to have fun on their own.

The task was almost getting boring when someone suddenly pulled on my tail.

Remember how I said earlier that Humans are surprisingly brave for how physically fragile they are? Well, here you get to see it in action.

A Human child, barely a quarter of my size sees me, an unknown predator with all the teeth, claws, and muscles you can imagine, and the first thing they do is to pull my tail.

This kind of behavior was starting to hover from bravery into a complete lack of survival instincts. I'm not saying I want children to fear me, but shouldn't they fear me? You know, from a biological standpoint? If I were a wild animal, I would've probably torn them to shreds by now.

Since I'm not a wild animal, however, I simply tried to get my tail back, giving it a few experimental tugs. When that didn't work, I tried yanking it away a bit more forcefully, only to end up with a giggling child dangling from my tail like a strange vine.

I had to admit, that was some impressive grip strength. The ability to suspend yourself by holding onto something was only achievable to Aqry through a combination of biting, anchoring one's hindclaws, and holding on, but using only one's foreclaws, or in this case hands?

Talk about being clingy.

I considered shacking until they let go but quickly discarded the idea. I was tasked with taking care of them, and didn't wish to pull any stunts that might get these kids hurt. Humans were a lot more fragile compared to Aqry, so logically Human children would be even more vulnerable.

The situation ended up resolving itself when they finally let go on their own and returned to their packmates. It was only then that I noticed that I had gathered a little audience, well little in size, but large in numbers.

A good portion of the children had stopped what they were doing, and some of the more curious ones were already approaching me with no fear whatsoever.

Now, don't laugh at me, but I was slightly intimidated by this. Having a large group close in on you with no fear whatsoever left an impression, even if they were childen. The animal inside me was an apex predator and expected other species to react with fear or caution to my presence, not boldness.

Having my instinct's expectations thrown out of the window was unsettling in a way I couldn't quite explain.

Someone was pulling on my tail again.

I turned around in annoyance and let out a gentle, but strict growl. Only in hindsight did I realize that this was probably not how Humans chastised their young for misbehaving.

One of the children seemed to agree as they smacked me across the snoot. ""Bad! No growlie!""

It didn't hurt, but my mouth still obediently clapped shut in stunned silence. Hey, you can't blame me, I've never been reprimanded by a child before, let alone one of an alien species.

Was this how human children defended themselves? Pure intimidation? If that was the case, then it was working, cause I didn't lift a claw when the same child happily clambered onto my back.

Wait, why am I listening to them? It's supposed to be the other way around, I'm their temporary caretaker after all, not the other way around.

""Alright kid, that's enough, please remove yourself from my back,"" I said in a voice that didn't sound nearly as unwavering as I hoped it would.

I tried to reach for them, but the young girl had made herself comfortable in an awkward spot where I couldn't quite reach them. They simply pulled their legs away with a soft giggle when I tried.

The only way that I could reach them was by turning my head around and grabbing them with my teeth, but that wasn't an option for multiple reasons. I would've done it in a fight, but right now my goal was not to injure anyone.

Wait, did they know?

I paused my attempts to remove my unwanted rider to consider that point. Did the children know that I wouldn't hurt them? From an evolutionary standpoint, this complete lack of fear made no sense, unless the lack of fear came from the fact that they were aware that I wouldn't hurt them.

The more I thought about it, the more sense it made- stars above, leave my tail alone!

I gave the culprit an annoyed look, but once again there was no fear. This time I managed to pull away before they could get a good grip on it, but the child simply laughed and chased after it.

I kept turning to keep it out of reach, but they were fast, and I ended up spinning in circles to keep up.

Now, if you ever wish to keep your tail safe from a Human child, don't do what I did, cause after about 30 seconds I felt ready to puke and unhealthily dizzy.

I had no choice but to stop and try to get my bearings, stumbling around in the process, only to suddenly find my tail locked in place.

""Got you!"" the child cried out victoriously, as he messed up my balance by immobilizing the limb that was vital for me to properly balance out.

No, I didn't fall, I lied down on purpose. The fact that it was a faceplant was also intentional.

At least I managed to get rid of my rider, but I made sure to turn in such a way that I could catch them when I fell- I mean, lied down.

That out of the way, I placed my head on the floor, groaning for all kinds of reasons. I'm no babysitter, but I'm pretty sure that migraines and bruises weren't part of the job description.

Years of training at a military academy only to get taken down by a freaking child. I want a refund!

The shuffling of little feet surrounded me, much to my horror.

""Is she alright?"" one of the little devils asked concerned, a tone I didn't think to be possible until now.

""I'm amazing..."" I snarled back, choosing to snarl so it wouldn't be a whimper. I'm not sure it worked.

The answer seemed to satisfy them and most of them disperced. Most of them.

""Let's play something else!""

Help!

I tried to scoot away when one of them, a female judging by the long pelt on her head, approached me, carrying some strange kit of tubes with colorful paste and brushes, sitting down right next to my feet, before boldly grabbing one of my sharp claws.

""Don't move dino friend.""

""But..."" I tried to complain, when they started applying some form of bright pink paint to my claws, forcing me to hold still.

Aqry claws were sharp, razor-sharp, and had evolved in such a way that they naturally stayed sharp as we used them. If I as much as twitched in the wrong way, the little girl might lose her hand, but she either wasn't aware or simply didn't care, forcing me to be the careful one.

What was it about these Humans that made them so carefree around dangerous things? They could get cuts from paper, and yet we Aqry with our armored scales looked paranoid next to their sheer absence of common sense.

My tail promptly fell victim to their grabby hands once more as one of the kids tied a colorful yellow ribbon around it.

To make things worse, I spotted another one approaching me holding what appeared to be crayons and... was that glitter?

I couldn't help myself, a desperate whine escaped my throat.

What did I do to deserve this?

\-000-

To be fair, Peter was doing his dam best to keep a straight face, but I had enough experience with Humans to know that he was seconds away from an avalanche of laughter.

""So Aqitya..."" he finally started with a voice trembling with his failed attempt to hide his raw amusement. ""Did you enjoy yourself?""

I snarled at him. My claws looked like colorful rainbows, I had ribbons tied to all kinds of places, my scales were covered in abstract art, doodles were scribbled on my flank and snout and everything ached with glitter powder.

""One more stupid question and I'm going to kill you.""

""Relax, I know some tricks to get rid of that stuff."" he offered peacefully. ""I'll just solo the rest of the shift so you can clean up and rest. By the way, can I take a picture of you before you leave?""

Humans, I can't decide if I love or hate them, but their bold bravery just had to be respected. Not only were they unnaturally comfortable around deathly predators, but they got away with that behavior as well.

He is always the guy who will ask you how your day was, tip 25% and go out of his way to hold a door open, which is awesome. We have never been well off and both grew up poor. I (40f) have worked for almost two decades at my career to the point where for the past two years I've made just into 6 figures (not a lot, just enough to be middle middle class). He has moved jobs a bunch, never focused on a career, and makes about 1/8 what I do. Our entire relationship we've shared money and debt, which luckily hasn't been much and we are both pretty good about living within our means. 90% of the time I've been the breadwinner, enabling him to quit jobs he doesn't like or move to find new opportunities (we have bought 4 houses due to this). Because of the income disparity he does most of the cooking, lawn moving, and house cleaning (I do all laundry, mopping, and dealing with pets).

In his personal relationships, over the past few years I've noticed that he's moved from being ""present"" to giving gifts to friends or buying things. Not picking up coffee, but buying food and gifts for friends ranging from $20-$50 randomly. He bought us both apple Watches and AirPods with some excuse but it felt like he only bought them also for me because he wanted it for himself (and it would look selfish if he JUST bought it for himself). He'll buy a strangers tab at the bar. He'll tip 40-50% on a bill. His behaviors seem to be becoming very transactional and less meaningful. I'm not sure if it's from a lack of confidence, but he is always saying ""if I do XXX, I'll get XXX"".  He acts like karma is a piggy bank you can cash in on and will say things like ""that's why you do nice things, so it will come back"".

I noticed this trend happening and brought it up, but it got thrown back in my face. Hard to recall the exact language but I said something like ""I've noticed since we've made more money that you'd been buying more things for friends, and in general. Its like you always expect to get something out of it and it feels like a transaction."" I said ""we"" about the money but I meant ""I."" (if I bring up money that'll also be thrown back on me). The whole thing turned into an argument with an accusation that I'm saying he's an awful person and we shouldn't do nice things for others....which was not my intent. Perhaps it's my current PMS state...

Am I wrong for asking him to think about meaningful gestures instead of spending money he doesn't contribute? Should I just be glad he likes to share? Am I being cheap? I plan on talking to my therapist about this next week but feel like I need an outside perspective.

tl;dr husband doesn't bring in much income but spends more money on random things and has moved from ""doing"" nice things for people to ""buying"" nice things for people. Am I am asshole for thinking his giving behavior can be negative?

EDIT: Adding more details that I should have put in the original post: If it was only spending on his friends I would agree with you and wouldn't have much of an issue. But he also bought larger things, like a brand new truck (top trim) when a mid, still very nice model would have still been a huge upgrade. He also wants to invest thousands in gold...

My biggest concern is that my job is a recent change and is not immune to layoffs, so I'm trying to be realistic. He got used to a certain lifestyle REAL fast and that could change. ",4,1744391250.0,marriageadvice,10,0.83,False

1jwuye8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jwuye8/wibta_if_i_downplayed_my_husbands_illness/,WIBTA if I downplayed my husband's illness?,"I know, I know, title might be a bit clickbait. It's a bit long because I'm a wordy individual (it gets me in trouble a lot), so sorry in advance. 

So, a little over a month or so ago (I don't remember when exactly), my husband(31M) got sick with a cold or something. At the time, our baby was about 4 months old and I was still on maternity leave and therefore the primary caregiver for her. I try to give grace a lot with my husband when he goes through things, whether they be a difficult time with anxiety, illness or just needing space, because I know how it feels to be in your head about taking space for yourself and how guilty it can make you feel. I don't know how many times I've advocated for him to relax and rest so he can feel better without the added stress. 

This time, though, we had a baby and I needed help. I asked if he could watch her for just a little bit, just so I could make myself some coffee and get ready for my day, but he complained that he didn't want to get the baby sick. I said that if he just didn't kiss her, didn't handle her for long, and washed his hands that she should be fine, but if she did happen to get sick, then I'd be able to give her antibodies (she's bf'd for reference) but if he was that concerned then I would just take care of her myself and he should rest so he can get better. He sat on the couch on his phone for about an hour before asking if he could go downstairs to play games. 

I reluctantly agreed but asked if he could at least do some dishes or something, and mentioned that he should be resting. Ultimately, in the nearly week he was sick, almost no dishes got done and they piled up pretty bad to the point that his parents had brought them up (they're also just nosy and kinda judgemental so not a far leap on their part). It was stressful because, while I'm not the cleanest person, I've been become a bit more of a clean freak since having a baby. It was a difficult time and when he finally started feeling better we were able to get the home a bit cleaner and back on track.

Fast forward to a little under a week ago. I have been back to work for about 3 weeks. Our baby got her second group of vaccinations and after almost a week of being fine she came down with a cold. She's been sick and it has been horrible to hear her coughing and wheezing, but what's been even harder is the fact that I must have gotten whatever she had because I have also been coughing, with chills and body aches and the occasionally dizziness. I expressed this to my husband multiple times, he has heard me coughing, and it's only gotten worse. 

The first day I chose to stay home from work because it was hard being at work while she was at home suffering and I wanted to help take care of her, but it ended up working out since I felt really sick that morning. My husband, however, was unsympathetic. When the baby woke us up at her usual time around 8 am, he asked me to take her first for a couple hours so he could get some more sleep, and then he would return the favor.

I was immediately irritated, remembering all of the times he asked me to take her in the morning because he didn't sleep well (he has sleep apnea and chooses to go to sleep around 3 am after getting home around midnight from work), and I would often take her in the morning without him even asking. But the one morning I am sick (and he knows it) and he still asks me to take her. So we get into an argument, where he felt it's not unreasonable to ask this and I reiterate that I am sick.

After a little ~*mental breakdown*~ over how I feel like crap and wasn't feeling supported at all, we had a tentative understanding. But having to care for a sick baby is already exhausting when you're doing it 50/50, it's even more exhausting when you yourself are not functioning at 100%. My husband, however, still insists on asking me to do my 'fair share' of caring for her and household chores. He did a bunch of dishes, then left some for me, staring that it seemed like a fair amount for me to do, and has been acting the same way he was before I went back to work (sitting on his phone on the couch next to me while I hold the baby, feed her, or otherwise occupy her).

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask me to do my fair share of household chores and taking care of the baby, especially since I'm her food source, but I think that my fair share should also be based on what I'm able to do currently. I've mentioned multiple times that I'm not feeling well, that I'm sick, and even listed my symptoms so he could understand where I'm coming from, and he's told me that I'm 'not that sick' and that I can still do something. And while I'm inclined to agree that I shouldn't get out of caring for my home and child because I'm sick, I let him do just that when he was sick before. 

It's been 4 or 5 days since I got sick and I am still trying to recover myself. This morning I swear I heard him sounding congested, which could just be how he sounds normally, but I just know if he does get sick from either of us, I will not be giving him the same grace I gave him before. 

So WIBTA if I gave him the same treatment and asked him to do his 'fair share' of household chores and caring for the baby despite being potentially sick?",14,1744391146.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,0.94,False

We met at work while she had a college bf and were friends for about 2 months before we started seeing each other as more she broke up with him and then we started hanging out a lot and dating a month later. 

We sat next to each other at work and it was awesome but also sucked at times too.

1jwuxdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colognes/comments/1jwuxdj/seeking_recommendation/,Seeking Recommendation,"**Recommendation Request - Pepper, Woody, Spicy, Fresh.**

I’m looking for something less mainstream. Let’s sort through my (and my partner’s) favorites on me. To start, my skin pulls spicy. 

For body wash and general lingering scents that I use:

I love Fig body wash by Harry’s. It’s clean, it’s a little spicy, it’s masculine. 

Arm & Hammer Deodorants - both, depends on the day. 


Perfumes/colognes:

Let’s go down the pipeline (oldest to newest, but I still wear all of these):

**Light Blue by D&G** is always a hit on me to other people. I get so many compliments on it. It smells aquatic, but again, my skin pulls spice too. It definitely changes from the bottle. 

**Polo Red** (after it sits awhile) is a hit. My partner loves this one on me; it feels a little powdery for my taste, but it works for colder weather and she loves it, so *shrug*

**Territoire**??? Super cheap, reminds me of Fierce by Abercrombie, which I did enjoy in my younger days as a clothes scent. 

**Dolce & Gabanna The One EDT** is a super-love for my partner on me and it does work. She says my skin sometimes smells of coffee (I don’t drink coffee), but for everyone that’s a fragrance person, I hope we’re getting somewhere. 

**Paco Rabanne’s 1 Million Lucky** - I love this one. It pulls very masculine on me; however, my partner wears this one and it pulls feminine for her. Am I making sense here?

**Blue Coach for men**? Not sure if that’s the scent name, my partner bought this one and I’ve never seen the box or looked it up - easy win in the office. It’s a great clothes smell. 

**Paper by Commodity** (expressive) - love this. I can’t wait for summer for my skin to heat it up and cast it a little farther. 

**Angel Dust EDP by Fugazzi** - I think this scent is a godsend. The pepper is incredible. I’ve actually only layered it though - with Paper and … *drumroll*

**Sugardaddy by Fugazzi** - We both hated this at first. It felt very medicinal. We let the sample sit for a few weeks (via not giving it away) and the weather warmed a smidge - had a weird feeling to try again and now I love it. One spritz to the skin of my neck and a little layer of Angel Dust and my partner’s asking me to wear it again. 

So what I’m asking is… what should I lean into? I want one-twelve more kinda niche fragrances. My partner’s really good at this, but I’m asking so we can broaden our search for masculine or unisex scents that we may not know about. 

Thank you!

Happened to me too. 

I bought the very famous ippodo sayaka that everyone’s raving about. Don’t get me wrong, I love it as usucha. It very easy to drink. But I also want to have it as a latte and enjoy it too. I want to have this flexibility of being able to drink both usucha and latte with it. But I have been struggling to love it for my lattes and I have been asking myself why am I not getting the same result as anyone else?

I have always been a dairy milk drinker for coffee or hot choco, I was even using full fat milk. But I got my blood work result and surprise, I have high cholesterol. So I went with low fat thinking it would also fit the taste of my matcha since it doesn’t have this strong milk taste like the other boxed milk. I also got the almond milk since its perfect alternative for my cholesterol but sadly the taste is definitely NOT what I want to have with my matcha. I can tolerate the taste on its own but not with matcha or coffee. So i just use it for my pudding recipes instead. 

I live in Germany so some milk that I‘ve seen others are using are not available here. Plus I go to a not so expensive grocery store so I usually grab what is available. But it felt like I have been wasting a good matcha for a sub paar latte just because I settled for a milk that does not fit the taste of the tea. So I decided to go to a different grocery store just to find something similar to what others are using and found oatly barista. Then I tested my matcha on 3 different kind of milk. I was mind blown how different the tastes were! 

I also got ummon still unopened. I know it’s good for usucha based on ippodo website and price range. But I‘m excited to open it and curious how it would taste with this oatly barista oatmilk. Anyone have tried it?

It's nice to have a morning water/juice/coffee and/or breakfast out on the patio, too, weather allowing. Related to working on my 'ear' is letting Merlin run off and on.

Was able to see or confirm hearing 15 this morning which...well, there are worse mornings. But Merlin just kept going OFF THE HOOK and I was starting to question myself. Put on headphones to get a better listen.

Mind you all of these are possible, but I would not normally expect all of them at once; and I hadn't seen or heard any myself while I was standing there.

In addition to what I could confirm, Merlin gave me:

>Cooper's Hawk (common locally, but would be new to my personal hotspot list)

>Great Horned Owl (nest somewhere nearby)

>White-crowned Sparrow (uncommon but expected)

>Great-tailed Grackle (very rare for my area)

>Red-winged Blackbird (common, and very hard to miss, was expecting them today but no show)

>House Sparrow (common, but not today)

>Brown-headed Cowbird (expected locally but would be new to this location)

  
After listening through each recording and using the ""jump to"" feature several times I finally realized that *all* of these except for the owl were, in fact ... drumroll ... the vehicle exit gate for my apartment complex. And the owl? The owl was a big truck inhaling as the driver slowed for a turn and then started to accelerate again (you could hear a big ""hoooo"" as the truck sucked air for a second).

 .

Anyway. The actual / final list I settled on was:

>Eurasian Collared-Dove

>Killdeer

>Northern Flicker

>American Kestrel

>Blue Jay

>Black-billed Magpie

>American Crow

>Black-capped Chickadee

>Bushtit

>Red-breasted Nuthatch

>European Starling

>American Robin

>House Finch

>American Goldfinch

>Spotted Towhee

Our living room has always seemed too small and crowded. The two entrances and fireplace make much of the wall space less usable. We also want it to look more open, more minimal, less cluttered.

We need lamps because there isn't any good room lighting. We have 2 tripod lamps and a bright panel light on top of the small cabinet. (I installed LED soffit lights myself but they are too dim for anything but mood.)

We would like a couch to recline on and a few other seats for guests or our family of five. My son made the coffee table and we want to keep it too.

The room is 19ft long and 13ft, 4in wide. The entrance to the dining room is 72 in wide and the hallway entrance is 68 inches. Yes, that is a map of Hyrule over the loveseat.

\- I am willing to replace most of the furniture, especially the couch.

I’m 22 years old, and I’d love to connect with others around my age—whether it’s to explore the city, grab coffee, hit up a museum, chill in a park, or just vibe over good conversation.
Also, being honest—I’d be open to dating too, if there’s a connection. So whether you’re looking for a friend, a hangout buddy, or maybe something more, feel free to reach out or drop a comment.

I'm having some trouble with some things that have been happening recently. One being that he talks about her all the time. He will do this, but then yesterday said to me ""I want our relationships to be parallel and separate."" That's fine, me too. But he'll still mention ""She said this funny thing"" or ""I think her favorite hobby is this"" etc, kind of endlessly. I have mentioned many many times that it makes me uncomfortable to continue talking about her at such length and with such frequency, but it's like it goes 'in one ear' most days. Sometimes I will ask a clarifying question like ""How did that go?"" or ""What does she think of that?"" but that's the extent of my involvement in the conversations and maybe even that is too much. He has said he likes to talk about it/her and sometimes I will indulge that for him because usually it's not hurtful or jealousy-inducing, but it's starting to feel like there's just no room left for me in conversations. He has also reasoned that it's because ""there's not much else going on in life.""

I've met her three times so far. We live in a very, very, very small area where we moved for his work. I admittedly started to conflate hearing so much about this person (We're so similar! We like the same stuff! She's very cute! etc.) for having a crush of my own. I've backed off from that completely. She wants to come over next week for dinner with the two of us, he invited her, I've told her that she's welcome but to not feel obligated.

They've been seeing each other pretty often lately. Almost every day. They work in the same place and will meet for walks or coffee. He told me that yesterday they 'went for a walk' and then later admitted that he went over to her place yesterday morning and that it was not actually a walk. He said he wasn't going to tell me the truth because he thought it would make me upset but.. I wasn't. His time is his time. However, a previous experience with this person made me upset which lent to his assumption that I would react that way. He and I had plans to hang out and do something one night but he decided to go out to dinner with her which I didn't know about until he got home late. He thought I would get upset because a sort-of-similar situation happened just two days ago.

I'm struggling with this a lot. I've tried talking with him about NRE, what it is, what it can do to an ADHD brain like his, but again it's like it goes in one ear and out the other. He and I have been together for 6 years, married for 3, and I'm feeling so snubbed. We don't do the same kinds of things we did before they got together. We used to go for late night drives, spend a day in bed, go for long walks or hikes, take the dog to run around the park, get lunch or dinner (admittedly we still do those sometimes) but even if we did do all those things, I still feel like this person is a HUGE part of our relationship because they constantly text and he constantly talks about her. We'll even be mid-sex session and I'll hear the constant buzz-buzz-buzz of his phone blowing up with texts. He has recently turned off notifications, but that was after I asked him to turn them off for a first time then he just... turned them back on.

Like I said, we've been married for three years - essentially open for all of them though it did coincide with covid and he had a rocky experience trying to date a monogamous woman a few years ago. We've been talking about what the future looks like (this summer when work lets up, he wants more than the one sleepover a week they've been doing even though they see each other almost every day now) and I'm just scared. I feel insecure in this relationship and I've tried to tell him that. The other day she talked with him and said that she was afraid that one of the times she and I hung out, she felt that I was trying to dissuade her from having a more serious relationship with him (I wasn't, we just talked about monogamy and his past experience trying to date a monogamous woman.) I clarified this with her and she said she was never actually worried about that. Recently he has been saying things that are making me feel additionally insecure like ""Our relationship is hierarchical because we're married"" and I'll reply ""Oh are you interested in non-hierarchical? We should have talked about that before we got married"" and he'll respond ""No I haven't really thought about it."" or ""No one knows what the future holds, our relationship might end, no one knows"" when I've asked for reassurance or connection.

I can't make him be a good partner. This is his first long-term-ish NM experience and he's lost in the sauce. The NRE novelty dopamine hits are absolutely an influence. He thinks about her all the time and he talks about her all the time. I've tried asking for special days that are just for us where we don't talk about her and he doesn't focus on texting her (I certainly don't text him when he's with her), I've tried asking to hear about her -less- not even necessarily not at all, but less. I feel like I keep asking for things and he's lost in the selfishness of NRE and what he wants.

I'm just fucking scared. I moved across the country for his job, am very slow to make friends here, only have a comet partner at present, and I'm feeling like I just don't matter. I've tried to voice these feelings and I just don't know who's listening. And I am so so so sad about it.",3,1744390484.0,nonmonogamy,5,0.71,False

I met him mga 2 years ago pa sa birthday party ng common friend namin. Naging mutuals kami sa IG, wala masyadong interaction after that. Naglalike lang siya ng mga posts and stories ko. Then ayun nga. He said he likes me and asked if pwede ba niya akong ligawan and get to know me more. Sabi niya matagal na daw niya akong crush since pa nung first time kami nagkita 2 years ago. To be fair, jowable naman talaga siya. Pero I said no agad.

I told him nicely na I appreciate yung courage niya, pero I'm not in the headspace to entertain anyone right now. Wala pa talaga sa isip ko yun and wala rin talaga akong time pa. Super busy rin ako sa work and career goals ko. Pero sabi niya okay lang daw, no expectations. Gusto niya lang raw akong i-pursue and hayaan ko lang daw siyang i-prove yung sarili niya. After that, halos everyday may pinapadala siya. Coffee, food, flowers, and he surprised me with my dream camera. 

I was shocked and honestly, na-overwhelm ako. Kahapon, kinausap ko siya. I told him na I'm really not comfortable with what he's doing. Binalik ko yung camera and sinabi ko na I don’t want him spending money on me. Hindi siya obligated to do those things. Then kanina, birthday ng common friend namin. Yung girlfriend ng celebrant sent me a voice message. Apparently, nag-open up si guy sa kanila and told them na kaya ko daw siya ni-reject kasi di pa raw ako over sa ex ko. Na nagpapahard to get lang ako and paasa. And na-sad ako sa sinabi niya na kung anu-ano daw pinapadala niya sakin pero never ko raw pinost sa stories. Parang inexpect niya na i-flex ko lahat ng bigay niya?

I tried to handle everything respectfully. Tapos ngayon, parang ako pa lumalabas na paasa or maarte. Ang sabi pa niya, masyado raw mataas walls ko. I have my reasons, and I know I’m doing what’s best for me right now. Honestly, hindi ko na alam anong gusto niyang palabasin. Hindi ko alam if I should confront him or just let it go.

Last month, a lady ""liked"" me along with very enthusiastic comments about how much we have in common and saying, ""please let me know if you would like to tal more"". This was followed by several exchanges over a couple weeks saying how much she likes chatting, complimenting me, asking about what I am doing, etc

I was not smitten, (I think I had even seen her on Match before bugt passed over, she is about three yeas older)but certainly intriuged, we did indeed have so much in common and I liked her enthusiasm, like one of those times you dont have to try to ""figure out"" what their intent is. But I probably would not have even kept up the exchange over days had she seemed so enthusiastic

Over my dating life, I have certainly been guilty of being interested in someone first, then sort of read into her singles that she liked me too but they were never there, I was just hoping and I ended up being wrong

She then (without my asking) offered me her phone number and suggested we get together. I guess I thought that meant calling her but she thought it meant getting together for coffee

So I called her last week and we had a wonderful conversation, I even really fell for her voice, it was so winsome. We talked for a couple of hours then at the end SHE suggested we get together for coffee. For some reason rather than just making plans to do that, I said yes, that sounds fun, I will call you to set up. Maybe the fact that I did not immediately take her up on meeting for coffee was a turnoff. Keep in mind she had already suggested we do this and I said I would prefer a phone call first

But by this time I was taken in alot more. Still not crazy about her but interested enough to see where this could go

So a couple days later Icall to set up, and she said she cannot in the near future as she is having a surgery on a foot a few days later then will be laid up for a while. (didnt she know that when SHE first suggested getting together? Why the excuse noww. No saying it isnt the truth, but didnt she know that in th first place/ (maybe she was open to it in the day or two following our first phone chat, but not now)

I did make a mistake saying if she is unable to drive because of foot, I can pick her up at her at her place She immediately dismissed that idea, and I dont blame her, that was stupid on my part. Maybe that thing turned her off

So i asked her if I could call her while she was convalescing ,and she said yes, she likes talking to me So that is not a bad sign, she could have said no.

But the night before her surgery, I texted her best wishes on her surgery and I hope she has a speedy recovery. She just said: Thank u! Nothing more. If she likes talking to me why so short? So I guess questions are: What could I have done to cool her off? Maybe was I too eager (though as said, if you read her initial comments on match, no one could have souned more eager) Seccond, has she cooled off? Maybe I am misreading it or maybe my negative view is correct based on the events. Maybe I am just looking at it in an overly negative way.

THird, how to proceed now? Folllow up a few days after her surgery to check in, or just lay back and let her make next move if she makes a move at all

I am just puzzled how someone who seemeed so eager at first now, to me anyway, doesnt seem as eager now. What did I do? Just weird how someone whose comments the first few days were so eager, always asking to talk, asking to meet, offering me her phone number without my asking could seem cooled off now. Again, maybe she isnt cooled off but not as much as I think. Maybe preoccupied with her foot surgery",1,1744390270.0,u_Old_Introduction2938,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I bought a house and we are going to live together. We are from The Netherlands. We both love coffee and we both drink together around 5-10 cups of coffee a day. We can't decide which coffee machine we want (right now we have no machine because we both live at our parents' house). 

My preferred drink is espresso, americano, or a flat white and my girlfriend likes a cappuccino, americano, or a flat white. We do not have a lot of experience but I like to cook and experiment. 

In our kitchen, we have created a coffee corner of 1 meter x 80 cm and we both want an eye-catcher. 

We are considering the coffee machines below:

My preference: Ascaso Steel Uno PID + Ascaso grinder

My girlfriend preference:  Sage barista touch impress or a Jura full automatic machine

The machine I want is expensive but I want the freedom to create and experiment myself. Also, I believe in 'buy less, buy better'. My girlfriend finds my choice too expensive and that it creates too much of a mess. She wants a good cup of coffee but less work. That is why she wants a machine that does most, or even all of the work.

Right now we can't decide. Is there someone who has experience with both machines and cares to help us to make this choice? Thanks in advance!",1,1744390175.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

	•	My 3-year-old daughter has seen a black snake in the room more than once. She gave it a name. She said it looked at her and it was mean. Another time she said there was a “monster in the closet” and BEGGED me to check. This wasn’t a game—she was scared. Even the next day she brought it up again like it really happened.
	•	We lost a gift card in the house and couldn’t find it anywhere. I fell asleep and had a dream where a random man was sitting on the edge of my bed. He leaned over, reached between the bed and the dresser, and pulled out the card. I woke up immediately, checked the spot—and it was exactly where he pulled it from in the dream. That shook me.
	•	I constantly feel energy around me. I’ll feel someone behind me when no one’s there. Cold wind in a still room. Chills out of nowhere. Like… something is watching sometimes. And my daughter has woken up crying, asking me to make the monsters go away. I held her and said “You’re safe, you’re protected,” and told whatever it was to leave. She immediately calmed down and went back to sleep.
	•	I stopped drinking recently and started smoking lightly at night instead. I feel so much better. I have more energy, clarity, and I just feel like myself. Like my soul can breathe. The only thing I drink daily is this mushroom coffee. Since then I’ve been more grounded and focused.
	•	The other day, my daughter looked at us and said:
“Mommy, your heart is pink. My heart is blue. Daddy’s heart is green. Nana’s is purple. Dee’s heart is indigo.”
Like… what? She’s THREE. But those colors are all tied to energy centers (chakras) and I didn’t even tell her that. I didn’t teach her that. She just knew.

Now the same psychic from Sephora reached back out and I’m finally going to see her this Sunday. But I’m nervous. Like, why is this all happening now? Why me?

Has anyone else experienced something like this during their spiritual awakening? Could my daughter be gifted too? And what does it mean when I keep seeing and feeling things like this?

Plan now is

\-cut all ivy and grass in garden, and burn it along with a lot of small brush (some from garden, also doing a lot of general yard cleanup, entire yard somewhat neglected for couple of years)

\-manually till/turn, blending in the ash, will probably also spread some fertilizer granules I have lying about, maybe some ammonium sulfate depending on amount of ash I end up with

\-cover the entire thing with black plastic, and let it sit through this summer all the way to next spring.  figure this should kill any weeds, seedlings, insects, etc., to give myself a nice fresh start

\-am also gonna try to start composting more kitchen waste (veggie cuttings, egg shells, coffee grinds), will add results of this right before planting in spring.

anything else I can/should do before I cover with the plastic?

typical plantings include Tomatoes (several varieties), Bell Peppers, Zuccini, cucumber, lettuce (several types), broccoli, beans.

In the comments of the video someone suggested grating the brick so as to increase the amount of exposed surface, increasing the potency. I used to make my own air fresheners by putting coffee beans in a sachet, which worked, but only for a short amount of time. Using the cheese grater might be a good idea.

I (23F) have been living here since 2021, and have recently had my two roommates (22F and 23F) move out, in December and March.  The girl that moved here in December (20F) is an angel and never home.  The one that moved here in March (26F) is a pain in the ass to live with.  The apartment (aside from her room) was furnished with stuff we have built up over the years.  Couch, TV, coffee table, TV stand, ice machine, espresso machine, etc.  are all stuff that myself or my previous roommates bought.  They were kind enough to leave the stuff they bought since their new places were already furnished.  However, with this new roommate (26F) being horrible (going through my personal drawers and taking things, doing my dishes immediately after I use them and complaining that she does everything for us, talking shit about us in front of us, harassing my old roommate for leaving a shelf unit in the living room, cleaning the bathroom loudly at 5 am because I didn’t have time the night before, etc.), and me moving out in May because I’ve been essentially bullied out of my current place, my old roommates and I have decided how we’re going to get revenge.

The living room technically belongs to my old roommate and I.  The couch, TV and TV stand are hers, the coffee table is mine, and my other old roommate bought the ice machine.  The only thing my new roommate bought are two stools for the island and a rug.  So when I leave May 1st, all of it is coming with me and is going to my old roommate for her to sell.  The best part about this, for me, is the ice machine.  My new roommate uses it like she bought it.  She uses the ice machine until it’s empty 3x a day, she’s incredibly loud with it, and never refills it.  Our freezer sucks at making ice, there’s never any room in it anyway for an ice cube tray to fit levelly.

I floss, brush, & rinse like it’s my religion. And yes, I even floss & brush after lunch. I don’t snack through my day, & I don’t sip sugar all day either.

A year ago (now, theee cleanings in the past) my hygienist asked if I eat candy, or drink soda. I’ve been her patient my whole life, so I wondered if we’ve ever talked about this before. I told her truthfully that I have *maybe* two Dr Pepper sodas a month & that I’ve never been big into soda. And someone who actively avoids dairy & wheat, I don’t eat chocolate, sweets, or gummy candy. She suggested I switch to diet Dr Pepper. Ok easy. 

Six months ago, my dentist said we needed to watch a spot on my tooth where I had my first filling ever. At 18, a shared cavity between two teeth that had been drilled & filled. They said really hone in on the flossing, brushing, & to chew some special gum. My dentist was very optimistic that I would be able to hold it off or restrengthen the spot. (?) 

This is cake, I never miss on my routine after all three meals of my day. I thought i had this most recent visit in the bag. 

Somehow I was diagnosed with six cavities, all flossing cavities, effecting the teeth outlined in the picture. & that I’ll need a crown. Obviously I start to tear up. I didn’t get much conversation in with the dentist, & he left after MO & MOD’ing my X-rays. So here I am talking into the abyss of internet, what the F could be the cause of this???????!! 

Everyone who knows my personal life is CONFUSED & so am I!!! My partner is extremely confused as I was the only partner she’s had so far who’s flossed.

I take my hygiene very seriously & NEVER skip my oral routine!???! How does this happen to someone like me?
 No smoke, no alcohol, yes workout, loves fruits vegetables & salads. Coffee & water drank at same time before morning routine. No takeout, only cook at home. Brushing with electric toothbrush, flossing with string floss (not glide), & a water pick for total gumline. Rinse is purple listerine.

You ever sit there wondering why your dream person hasn’t just *appeared* yet? Like, where are they hiding? Spoiler: they’re not gonna knock on your door with a sign saying, “I’m the one!” You gotta go out and *make it happen*. But here’s the thing—meeting people isn’t some mystical art. It’s not about picking *one perfect way* to find them. It’s about balance, action, and showing up as your best self. Let me break it down for you.

**Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket**

Here’s a trap most people fall into: they think there’s *one right way* to meet someone. Dating apps? Sure. Nightlife? Maybe. Through friends? Okay, cool. But why limit yourself? Life’s like a buffet—why stick to just the tacos when there’s sushi, pizza, and steak on the table?

Mix it up. Meet people at work. Join a hobby group. Let your cousin set you up (yeah, family hookups can work). Hit the bars. Swipe on the apps. Each spot’s got its own vibe, its own crowd. The more places you show up, the more shots you get at meeting someone who clicks.

But here’s the real question: *where should you even start?*

**Pick What Fits You (and Them)**

Not every activity’s gonna be your jam, and that’s okay. Here’s the trick: do stuff you *actually like*. Love running? Join a run club. Into artsy vibes? Sign up for a pottery class. If you’re having fun, you’ll stick with it. And when you stick with it, you get good. When you get good, you *shine*. People notice that. Confidence is magnetic.

But hold up—there’s a second part. Think about *who* you want to meet. You’re not gonna find the same crowd at a CrossFit gym as you will in a choir group. Want someone active? Hit the yoga studio. Looking for a deep thinker? Try a debate club. It’s like fishing—go where your fish are swimming.

This is something ROAST nails: *niching down*. Stop trying to impress everyone. Focus on attracting the *right* person for you. The rest? Let ‘em scroll by.

# The Big Question Nobody Asks

Okay, so you’re in the right place. You’re doing your thing. You’re surrounded by cool people. Now what? *How do you actually meet them?*

Picture this: your dream person’s sitting on a couch, five feet away. They’re smiling, looking all perfect. Would you know what to say? Would you freeze? Or would you walk over, crack a joke, and make it feel effortless?

A mentor of mine once dropped this gem: 

>""If the girl / man of your dream is in a couch, just right there, would you know what to tell him/her? Because i would"".

Harsh? Maybe. But i wouldnt at the time. True? Definitely. Breaking the ice is a skill. Starting a convo, keeping it flowing, making them laugh—it’s not magic. It’s practice.

But here’s the kicker: the better you feel about *you*, the less you’ll stress about what to say.

**Your Secret Weapon? Inner Value**

Before you worry about witty openers or perfect texts, work on *you*. The more value you bring—confidence, passion, authenticity—the less you’ll need to “game” your way into someone’s heart. People can smell desperation from a mile away. But they’re drawn to someone who’s comfortable in their own skin.

That’s what ROAST is obsessed with: helping you show up as your *best, authentic self*. Whether it’s IRL, on the apps, or in a random coffee shop convo, you gotta know how to flex your value without trying too hard. (We’ll dive deeper into that another day—stay tuned.)

**10 Activities to Meet Your People**

Ready to get out there? Here’s a list of 10 activities that are goldmines for meeting people. These aren’t just random ideas—they’re spots where real connections happen:

1. **Run Clubs** – Forget dating apps. Run clubs are where it’s at. Sweat, chat, grab coffee after. Boom, you’re bonding.
2. **Theatre Acting Classes** – Nothing breaks the ice like pretending to be someone else together. Plus, it’s fun as hell.
3. **Pottery or Art Classes** – Get your hands dirty, laugh at your wonky creations, and vibe with creative types.
4. **Debate or Speech Clubs** – Sharpen your mind and meet people who love a good verbal spar. Bonus: you’ll get confident fast.
5. **Random Meetups** – Check out local events on Meetup or Eventbrite. From board games to hiking, there’s something for everyone.
6. **Cooking Classes** – Chop, stir, flirt over a shared stovetop. Plus, you might eat something decent.
7. **Improv Comedy Workshops** – Laugh your ass off and bond over looking silly. It’s like therapy, but funnier.
8. **Book Clubs** – Deep talks about stories lead to deep connections. Pick a genre you love.
9. **Volunteering** – Do good, feel good, meet good people. Animal shelters, food banks—pick a cause.
10. **Dance Classes** – Salsa, swing, or hip-hop—moving together sparks chemistry. Trust me.

# What’s Next?

You don’t need to overhaul your life to meet people. Start small. Pick one activity. Show up. Be yourself. Work on your inner game, and the rest will follow.

But here’s the open loop: *what happens when you finally meet someone great?* How do you keep them hooked? How do you turn a spark into something real? That’s where the real fun begins. Stick around—I’ll spill those secrets soon.

Navigating the world of beverages while following a ketogenic diet can feel like walking through a nutritional minefield. Many keto dieters find themselves wondering about their favorite fizzy drinks, especially Diet Coke. Is this popular zero-calorie beverage a friend or foe to your low-carb lifestyle? The good news is that Diet Coke can potentially fit into your keto diet, but there are crucial considerations to keep in mind. Understanding how this beverage interacts with ketosis is key to maintaining your dietary goals and overall health.

What is the Keto Diet and How Does Diet Coke Fit In?

The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat eating plan designed to push your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. In this state, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. When it comes to Diet Coke, the beverage appears to be a potential ally for keto dieters due to its zero-carb and zero-calorie profile.

Key Nutritional Breakdown of Diet Coke
• 0 grams of carbohydrates
• 0 calories
• 0 grams of sugar
• Contains artificial sweeteners

The Artificial Sweetener Dilemma

While Diet Coke doesn't contain sugar, it does include artificial sweeteners like aspartame. These sweeteners can have complex effects on your body and ketosis:

Potential Concerns with Artificial Sweeteners
• May trigger insulin response
• Could potentially disrupt gut microbiome
• Might impact metabolic health

Experts remain divided on the complete impact of artificial sweeteners on a ketogenic diet. Some studies suggest that while these sweeteners don't directly kick you out of ketosis, they might indirectly affect your metabolic goals.

Hydration and Electrolyte Considerations

Diet Coke contains caffeine, which can have a mild diuretic effect. Keto dieters need to be particularly mindful of hydration and electrolyte balance. While Diet Coke can contribute to your fluid intake, it shouldn't replace water as your primary beverage.

Recommended Hydration Strategies
• Drink plenty of water
• Consider electrolyte supplements
• Limit caffeinated beverages
• Monitor your overall fluid intake

Moderation is Key

**Experts recommend moderation** when consuming Diet Coke on a keto diet. While it doesn't contain carbs, excessive consumption might have unintended consequences on your nutritional goals.

Recommended Consumption Guidelines
1. Limit to 1-2 cans per day
2. Prioritize water and other keto-friendly beverages
3. Listen to your body's response
4. Consider occasional alternatives

Potential Alternatives to Diet Coke

For those seeking variety, several keto-friendly beverage options exist:
• Sparkling water
• Unsweetened tea
• Black coffee
• Infused water with minimal ingredients

Individual Metabolic Responses

It's crucial to understand that metabolic responses to Diet Coke can vary. Some individuals might experience:
• Minimal impact on ketosis
• Slight insulin response
• Potential cravings
• Digestive changes

Monitoring your personal response through ketone testing and paying attention to your body's signals is essential.

Long-Term Health Considerations

While Diet Coke might seem like a convenient option, long-term health should be a priority. Consider consulting with a nutritionist or healthcare professional to understand how artificial sweeteners might impact your specific health goals.

1jwuadw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jwuadw/struggling_to_get_anything_not_souracidic_bambino/,Struggling to get anything not sour/acidic [Bambino Plus / Encore ESP],"Hi everyone. I've tried so many things to get something that doesn't taste awful and am just wasting bag after bag of beans now.

Things started ok when I got the 2 machines. Seemed ok tasting ish. I bought some supermarket beans with a roast date which came out ok but I didn't think they tasted nice. That was with all stock equipment too.

I have just bought some beans from a local roaster. Claiming one is 5/5 roast level, and the rest are 3/5 and are a part of their 'espresso taster' set. They were roasted a week ago now.

No matter what grind I choose it's coming out sour. I am going mainly with 18g in, and trying to get 36-40 out and aiming for 30s in order to try and get something that tastes even average. I am using a naked portafilter and have tried the stock basket, and purchased an extra IMS 14-18g basket to try and fix things. I've tried with and without puck screens, I am using paper filters on the bottom, I am using a WDT and then using a levelling 30lb pressure tamper. I am preheating the basket before hand and running the steam want for a couple of seconds before pulling the shot to preheat.

Grind size: I started off around 15 but it came out so fast. I then toned it down a click at a time and have ended up around 10 setting that gets it around 30s but tastes pretty bad. I have tried much lower to make sure the grind is changing and it does choke it eventually. I have checked the little nut thing inside and it's very secure so it's not that. I read somewhere that I should go coarser if I've tried finer already, and that just resulted in it running very quickly. I've also checked the burr carrier for damage and it seems fine and I've given it a clean. Shim wise, whatever is stock is what I use.

The times are somewhat inconsistent even when it's the same grind, but when I get it to a point when it's running slow enough it seems to come out pretty slowly to start with and then really run fast afterwards, which would lead me to believe maybe channelling but then I don't understand how to then solve that without going maybe coarser, which just results in gushers. There also does not appear to be any channelling but I know that it's not always visible. I assume there is something I am doing wrong in the puck prep, or grind, or coffee is too fresh maybe? The other thing I was unsure of is whether I should up or lower the dose. But at this point I have no idea. I feel like I've watched every video that there is and read every thread on here and other forums and just keep going round in circles.

I have tried salami shots to see if there is an area it tastes good, as well as splitting the shots into 2 to 'mix' a good espresso, but that didn't work or help much either.

I am willing to try anything at this point to try and fix what I'm doing wrong so any suggestion is welcome. I have considered that I just don't like the beans as I'm not big on acidity, but the 5/5 roast I assumed I would enjoy much more, but even that tastes sour most of the time.

On the plus side, my latte art has come on a lot because I need to drown all this in milk to make it palatable. Silver linings I guess. Thanks in advance everyone for any help you can offer!",1,1744389491.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I’ve always been a little sensitive, but lately it feels like something is waking up in me. Like I’m being pulled into something bigger. And it honestly started the day I met a psychic in Sephora (yes, Sephora lol).

This was in 2023. I was just minding my business shopping when this woman walked right up to me and said she was a psychic medium. She immediately asked if I had a grandmother who passed—and said my grandma was with me and wanted to help me. I didn’t even say anything. She just knew.

Then she looked me straight in the face and said:

“You’re intuitive too. You have a gift. You can ask for signs.”

I brushed it off at the time, but fast forward to now? Sh*t has been happening I can’t explain.
	•	My 3-year-old daughter has seen a black snake in the room more than once. She gave it a name. She said it looked at her and it was mean. Another time she said there was a “monster in the closet” and BEGGED me to check. This wasn’t a game—she was scared. Even the next day she brought it up again like it really happened.
	•	We lost a gift card in the house and couldn’t find it anywhere. I fell asleep and had a dream where a random man was sitting on the edge of my bed. He leaned over, reached between the bed and the dresser, and pulled out the card. I woke up immediately, checked the spot—and it was exactly where he pulled it from in the dream. That shook me.
	•	I constantly feel energy around me. I’ll feel someone behind me when no one’s there. Cold wind in a still room. Chills out of nowhere. Like… something is watching sometimes. And my daughter has woken up crying, asking me to make the monsters go away. I held her and said “You’re safe, you’re protected,” and told whatever it was to leave. She immediately calmed down and went back to sleep.
	•	I stopped drinking recently and started smoking lightly at night instead. I feel so much better. I have more energy, clarity, and I just feel like myself. Like my soul can breathe. The only thing I drink daily is this mushroom coffee. Since then I’ve been more grounded and focused.
	•	The other day, my daughter looked at us and said:
“Mommy, your heart is pink. My heart is blue. Daddy’s heart is green. Nana’s is purple. Dee’s heart is indigo.”
Like… what? She’s THREE. But those colors are all tied to energy centers (chakras) and I didn’t even tell her that. I didn’t teach her that. She just knew. Or maybe it’s just her saying things and using her imagination? I can’t help but think it’s more..

Now the same psychic from Sephora reached back out and I’m finally going to see her this Sunday. But I’m nervous. Like, why is this all happening now? Why me?

Has anyone else experienced something like this during their spiritual awakening? Could my daughter be gifted too? And what does it mean when I keep seeing and feeling things like this?

I went with Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberries and Cream, Salted Caramel, Iced Coffee and Cinnamon Roll (yet to try)

I started off with the ‘safe’ flavours vanilla and chocolate for day one and noticed that each didn’t make my body feel good at all. A lot of gas and acid reflux after about 3 hours. I took a second look at the ingredients and was surprised to see that those flavours were sweetened with sucrolose, I wondered if that could be the issue, and at the time I thought it was strange and a missed opportunity that Huel wasn’t using something like Stevia. I mentally condemned Huel to be honest until I woke up the next day feeling so much more revived in my wellness than I have done in a while. I’ve been going through a depression lull since November last year and have had such bad insomnia leading to a nocturnal cycle that it ended up turning to nothing but junk food and take away, putting on a lot of weight and probably malnutrition, so it’s like a light came on after just one day of complete nutrition!

So with that I thought I would carry on and at least finish these expensive drinks, see it through. By then I’d started lurking on this sub and had seen so many positives for salted caramel that I made that my breakfast. Delightful! Really yummy and… ‘why does this feel good in my tummy??!’ checked the ingredients not expecting to see that my wish had coincidently came true and this one was sweetened with stevia… strawberries and cream read the same so to trial I stuck with the same thing and for the whole of that day and the next on the stevia flavours, everything has been great.

Now I was ordering things on Gopuff and noticed they had a Fam membership deal on discounted White RTD Huel chocolate and vanilla so I stocked up on the same day the Amazon box arrived… I tried a chocolate one this morning and the gut churning, the acid… the motions in the ocean. I felt like a toxic Pokémon. It had a foil cap unlike the Amazon one and after some digging I’ve learned that foil means EU made and non means US. All of the Amazon then were US made?

I’ve got the cinnamon roll to tide me over tonight, Huel Black packets on order (as I learned they are all stevia sweetened) like four v1. Foil cap one’s left that I am afraid of now. I still feel not well 😝

We have had a great time having sex, but it doesn’t happen as often as I wish (less than once a week). He’s never horny when I’m most ready (at night) because he’s not a night owl like me. That is workable, but I’m often too busy midday for spontaneous intimacy when he is more energetic - he has a WFH job, I do not. But we were working on it. Recently he has experienced some pretty genuinely tough life events - tumultuous relapse of a family member, and the sudden death of a friend, and has sadly but understandably slipped into a depressive episode. The last time we had sex we started out fine, then he emotionally plummeted as soon as it was over and began crying, saying he does not feel great about his body. This was very upsetting and so we agreed to hold off on sexual intimacy while he’s in this rut.

Thing is, I have a lot of energy pent up. Obviously I am a high libido woman and he is my first real boyfriend. I always imagined the early stages of my first relationship would be a lot steamier than this, but here I am. I am a high energy person in general, both of my jobs are very physical, I also work out, go for walks, volunteer, go out dancing, skating, and just generally am happiest running around. I know exercise is the most recommended outlet, but a good workout only makes me hornier. Given how our last encounter went, I feel guilty for wanting him so bad since I can’t act on it without him being too tired or not in a good state of mind.

1jwu2v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jwu2v1/suffering/,Suffering,"I know everything’s worse rn cause it’s my time of the month but I’m really struggling. I met someone almost 2 years ago after my ex kicked me out it was really bad. I met someone while I was couch surfing at my friends. It was love at first sight for me. He was the first guy I kissed other then my ex in 5 years, our first date was magical. And then he ghosted. He was really shady with messaging but I gave him leeway, then he messaged me on my ex’s bday, turns out it was his bday too!! I thought it was fate, he said he wanted to see me when he got back.

Then I got my cat, I had gotten a job a few days before he messaged me so I thought it was fate and everything was lining up. 2 days after I got my cat, we had sex for the first time and it was magical to me. It was great for 3 months after that, he messaged me everyday!! I was the one ending dates. He was interested and I thought we would eventually date. That’s until I got him to come over, he started acting weird, he was supposed to help take down the AC, he bailed at doing that, acted weird and left. His communication changed after, he wasnt replying much or sending me messages. I took it so hard. Then 2 weeks later, silence. Ghosted. He had previously told me I could come over in November. So I waited. November came and went, I literally was miserable, I got really depressed and suicidal. January came, I messaged him, he replied, it was weird though I wasn’t sure what was going on. He brought up our sex life like a week after but was still being shady. I even asked him out and he was shady with confirmation. I started to get better, started meds, my friend if a friend came over to help as I was very depressed. Then a full month later after me and the friend of a friend drunkly messed around when we were way to intoxicated, it’s like he sensed it and he wanted to see me again.

We hung out that weekend and I was under his spell again. We started seeing each other and I was excited. But I was also getting evicted. It was tough. We had sex and did BDSM impact play, he injured me bad and didn’t follow up, I went through bad subdrop and he did piss poor aftercare. I couch surfed at a couples house who abused me badly. He canceled on me during that time, I saw him once. They had starved me bad and I was so dizzy, me and him had raw sex. It was so intense and intimate. Then the couple kicked me out after I refused to send money in April for May as she had just yelled at me for buying coffee with my own money. They stole belongings from me. Sent me abusive text messages, they locked me out and had my stuff for days. I got most of it back with the police but they had robbed me of belongings. Me and the guy had a date planned and my aunt started housing me. He canceled on me and I got mildly upset, he ghosted me forever after that.. I had to deal with everything on my own and I still had impact play marks on my body for months because he went to rough on me. Now it’s been a year. Complete silence, I’m miserable, applying for odsp, I’m suicidal, I at least got my cat back and we live with my mom who’s now taking care of me as I’m traumatized after being homeless and getting abused. Idk what to do and I stupidly keep on being in love with that asshat that blocks me on everything and refuses to talk to me. I meant nothing to him. I just cry to my cat. I didn’t take it well after he ghosted and I got SAed badly at a club and then dated an awful guy who SAed and abused me fully knowing my trauma. I haven’t dated since November. I’m suffering and mostly just hold my cat and cry. I watch some anime and read. I used to work but got laid off due to them going out of business. Why didn’t he love me? I gave him so much of me. I forgave him, he ghosted me for so long and I forgave him. I just only got mildly upset about him canceling, he didn’t even do what he promised by making up for the lack of aftercare and follow up. I hate that everyone abuses me and then gives me the silent treatment when I get upset after a long time of accepting bad behaviour. I miss him so much. I hate that I miss him. He was my first FP and my first dom. I struggle so much with my mental health now and he doesn’t care.",1,1744388959.0,BPD,0,0.99,False

I'm learning from y'all how to be a more interesting review writer but they're still on the short and dry side so bear with me lol.

I have always enjoyed perfume but discovered indies one year ago after experiencing cravings for some unusual scents, musty basement in particular (PSA: this can be a sign of low iron levels/anemia, as it was in my case!) **Solstice Scents** was the second house I tried after reading through the suggestions in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/12bw0rh/any_ideas_for_a_true_basement_smell/). I found some musty dusty scents I really love (TLDR: **During the Rain** and **Library** are my Solstice holy grails) but I've also started to branch out and explore through sampling. I'm still developing my tastes, but so far I'm:

* most interested in atmospherics: musty, basementy, mildewy blends but also rain, petrichor, dirt, bricks, concrete/cement, asphalt, rocks, clay, sand, salt or other mineralistic notes, dust, laundry, pine, or papery notes. I'm starting to love motor oil, diesel, and gasoline notes as well.
* open to most florals and musks (laundryish musks are my fav) but haven't tried heavy or animalic versions of either. Also open to wood and green scents, coffee and tea notes, herbal notes, and rain or other fresh water aquatics.
* not too interested in super sweet gourmands but I am open to foodie notes like fruit, berries, citrus, chocolate, marshmallow, etc. in the right blend. I love non-gourmand vanilla and coconut.
* not interested at all in anise/licorice, lactonic notes, boozy notes, honey, or maple syrup.

I'm mainly interested in oils currently, but have tried a few of Solstice's alcohol-based extraits as well. I don't care about throw or sillage, and longevity is nice, but I don't mind reapplying throughout the day. On to the reviews, in alphabetical order!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Cellar** (Damp Earth, Stone, Wooden Casks, Cool Fall Air, Apple, Pear, Broom Corn)**:** I get more and more obsessed with this every time I wear it, and it's SUCH an easy wear for fall. The apple note is so fun and not cloying or candle-y at all, it smells like an apple ice cream blizzard with fresh apples but the ice cream is wet cement. Yum! May FS this one.

**Badlands** (Dry woods, worn leather, dusty fossils, sandalwood, palo santo, hot resins, juniper wood, ponderosa pine cone, parched grasses and desert plants, oud, spices): This is so nice. Lightly smoky, hot, and very dusty. I think it has some layering potential with sweet scents,

**During the Rain** (Storm accord layering note - petrichor, soaked Earth, limestone, loam, clay and wet concrete): LOVE this one and immediately FSed. Perfect dirty realistic wet cement smell. It's very cool and has a hint of something herbal like lavender, so it really gives me a basementy laundry vibe which can be amped by layering with a laundry scent. I also love layering it with floral or desert scents.

**Gibbon's Boarding School** (Dusty Wooden Desks, Paper, Leather, Amber, Tobacco, Dying Fire, Dried Leaves, Autumn Breeze): This is a sweet and tiny bit spicy wood with a hint of astringent furniture polish that I don't care for, similar to Fantome's Parlour. It's almost churchy with the sweet polished wood and waft of incensey spice. and The astringency fades on drydown and leaves a beautiful sweet wood, but overall I prefer Sawmill or Manor for the dusty wood scent I'm looking for. It does layer nicely with sweet scents to cut the astringency and to complement the sweet and give it a little depth.

**Gulf Breeze** (Saltwater, sand, seashells, sea oats, rain, ambergris (vegan accord)): Smelled seaside-fishy in the bottle at first but is mellowing out as it ages. It's a VERY realistic sea or lakeside scent. I think it could be interesting to layer; it really amped the sand note in Alkemia's Sandscape.

**High Desert** (Desert Sage, Ceremonial White Sage, Sandalwood, Mitti, Cacti, Tobacco, Hay, Smoke, Labdanum, etc.): I loved this at first but the strong sage note is maybe a bit too heavy for me, although it mellows as it dries. It's good layered with During the Rain.

**Library** (Leather Bound Books, A Carved Rosewood Mantle, Dying Fireplace Embers, Wood Wainscoting, Cedar Shelving and Aged Paper): LOVE this. It's a perfect book smell to me and has just the right amount of musty and dusty while still being very wearable. I really don't get leather or embers, just nice aged book paper with some light wood. It layers really nicely with tea scents too--Novella by Alkemia is a fav. Will FS.

**Manor** (Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood): I didn't smell much in the bottle initially, and trying on skin in hot weather was just overwhelming vanilla. In cold weather it completely transformed on my skin and is rich, woody, and a little dusty, with a beautiful dry vanilla. It's such an easy wear for winter, I'm really starting to get the hype on this one and Solstice's wood scents in general!

**Old Florida Backroads** (Sunlit Leaves, Dusty Limerock Road, Warm Soil, Baked Woods, Heat Haze, Spanish Moss, Rain In Organic Cane Sugar Alcohol): I thought I would love this based on the notes, but there is something in there that is overpowering everything for me, similar to a generic men's cologne type scent. I gave it an hour or so before scrubbing and it didn't change. Disappointing, but I sampled Badlands at the same time and it gave me the hot dustiness that I was looking for.

**Orient Rose** (Rose Absolutes, Rose Ottos, Rose de Mai, Rose Attar, Tea Rose Accord, Vanilla Musk, White Musk, Ambergris (vegan), Amber, Indian Vetiver): Really lovely; it's not too sweet, cloying, or ""old-fashioned,"" and I like the vanilla base. I tried it layered with During the Rain and it's spice and roses growing out of wet concrete, and it's also nice layered with the woody vanilla of Manor. It's one of the strongest and longest-lasting Solstice oils I've tried so far.

**Parlor Trick** (Ivory lace, white wax, aged paper, glossy white smoke, teak, black tea, blonde woods, delicate spice, bone musk, Manor and a faint trace of rose)**:** I can't smell much of anything in the bottle, and on my skin it's a just a faint wood and vanilla. The wax note is taking it too far into scented candle territory for me. I've heard good things about this one so will probably come back to it.

**Riverside Hayride** (Moist Dirt, White Carnations, Fallen Leaves, Bare Branches, Hay & a Hint of Pressed Apples): This smells like apple in the bottle but on my skin it's more reminiscent of a fall candle, which is not necessarily bad. I layered it with During the Rain for more dirt which was nice. I started to appreciate this more during the holiday season and once it got really cold for its more wholesome and cozy vibes.

**Runestone** (Natural Earthy Forest Blend With Aged Patchouli, Vetiver, Oakmoss, Cedar, Violet Leaf, Dirt, Leaves, Cypress, Spruce): I love the stone note in this, and I also get a foresty, piney vibe along with a light patchouli. It's great but I'm not sure I like patchouli enough to FS.

**Sawmill** (Fresh Cut Wood, Wood Resin, Balsam, Cured Woods, Pine, Black Coffee, Motor Oil, Amber, Saw Dust): I'm obsessed. This is my favorite wood scent that I have tried so far. It's woody and dusty but also so rich and complex from the coffee, motor oil, and amber notes. The coffee note is especially amazing and really satisfies my want for a coffee scent that's not sweet or milky. I'll probably FS this one as well.

**Scrying Smoke** (Natural and Meditative Melting Frankincense Resin, Frankincense Smoke, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Cedar, Petigrain, Vetiver, Labdanum & much more): Very sweet. I saw a review that mentioned an ""opened a can of cola"" accord, and I can see that. Layering with an intense fragrance with incense notes (Alkemia's Book of Shadows) worked well.

**Sea of Gray** (Vanilla rain, saltwater, seaweed, ambergris (vegan), white amber, roasted seashells, white sandalwood, frangipani): Smelled seaside-fishy in the bottle, similar to Gulf Breeze, but mellowed out over time. Initially on skin all I could smell was vanilla, but now I get the subtle cool minerally seaside element which makes this so much more interesting than a typical vanilla scent. I have really been loving it in cooler weather.

**Sirocco** (Sandalwood, Saffron Threads, Hot Baked Earth, Myrrh, Spices, Oud & Jasmine): This smelled heavily indolic in the bottle for a long time. It's finally mellowing out but I can't bring myself to test it yet! I've heard amazing things about it so I'm not giving up!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
That's it for now, but I have a few more on my Solstice wishlist, including **Foxcroft**, **Midnight Marquee**, and **Wilcox's Potting Shed**. Recommendations for other scents I might be missing from Solstice or any other house are always appreciated! Thx for reading!",12,1744388781.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

I have been going to this place for 4-5 months constantly to get coffee before class, always in the excuse to talk a bit with him. Long story short, I believe he is into me, he complimented my coat (which men don't usually do in my experience), he remembers my order, what we talk about, my friend tells me he looks over at me a lot, etc.  
  
Today, I gathered the courage to ask for his name, he gave me his hand immediately. Chatted a bit. I told him i had a full stamp card but was not sure where it was. He told me not to worry about it, and that it was on him. But I kept searching for it. He said not to worry about it but... I've had this full stamp card with my name and number written on it for a while, waiting for the moment I'd gather the courage to give it to him. I find it and I slid it to him across the counter and I asked him: Are you sure you don't want it? He's not looking bc he's making the coffee and he says: 'Keep it'. And then i pointed at it and asked again: 'Are you sure?' Looking at him, at the card, at him again, at the card, hahaha, he seems to realize the number and finally grabs the card. 

Whatever happened afterwards I cannot remember very well because I was shaking and I was so nervous and my heart was pounding. I was also kind of rushing to go to class :( 

This is the first time I do something like this, and I'm so anxious about it. I'm even wondering if he actually noticed the number... But, anyways, I'm just wondering, how long should it be before he texts/calls me? A friend said something about the 3 day rule, is that a thing?",7,1744388760.0,dating,15,0.77,False

1jwty5h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwty5h,We were together for almost 23 years... RIP Alice 2002-2025,"I still can't believe it actually happened. She was so strong. She never showed any pain. She handled every day of her long life like a fluffy little warrior.

I brought her home when I was 6 yeard old. Mom wasn't expecting this at all but in the end she gave up and allowed me to have her. I took her from my kindergarten's friend. She had a character since her first months and she didn't behave good at his home so they decided to give her away. They gave her name Alice and we kept it. I've seen this name only a few times since then so it was fitting her perfectly and it was unique as she was.

She actually had a \`tortitude\`. She was full of energy and interest to everything around. She liked running around the flat, hissing at any guests and pooping wherever she wants. But it never affected my love to her. I think she was the main reason for me being a cat person and me having a soft and emotional character. But she also was very supportive and whenever I felt bad she always came to me trying to release my pain.

I lived with her until I went to university in a neighbor city when I turned 18. She was already about 11-12 years old back then. We already thought she's a granny. I remember me having a small argument with my mom about Alice when she once again pooped (or peed) wherever she shouldn't poop (or pee) at these pre-university days. She said Alice is old and she's going to die soon. She was just emotional and she never said anything like this ever again but I remembered these words. Since then I was always afraid of loosing my kitty. But she felt perfect despite she actually might be considered a little old already. But she never looked old until her last days.

Being in a university, I spent 5-6 hours one-way to get to the home every weekend to met with a girlfriend. So I've seen Alice pretty often as well. I also used to spend every summer at home. She already was about 15-16 years old when I graduated and her age still wasn't noticeable at all.

Since then I used to come home for a couple days every few months. Alice was always there. She was a part of the home. She was the home.

She never had any significant health issues until a year ago. We never took her to a vet because there was almost none in our home town. But later we thought it would be too nervous for her to be seen by a vet. For the most part of her life we gave her simple home food and basic cat food whatever was available. In the last years I tried to pamper her with all the different cat food but mostly she still preferred the simple one. I even brought some cat treats from Thai trip. We never gave her any pills as well. As I said she has always been strong. She was just never looking sick or ill. We thought she never needed any treatment - but we were wrong...

But about a year ago she almost lost her hearing. A half a year later it was the eyes. The rustle noises could made her convulsing. I've seen it once during my second to last home visit 4 months ago and it was awful. I cried all the night. But still she looked pretty well. I thought it's just the age. But she was so strong... Even blind and deaf, she was independent. She never needed any help. At least she wanted to be seen like this. She walked around and had a good appetite until her last days. She was already older than 22. But along with all the diseases she started loosing weight and strength. I still thought it's just the age. I thought she's actually immortal. Mom thought the same. We were so proud of her. She was older then some of my friends. A lot of people couldn't believe it's even possible to have such an old cat.

I was worried but I still believed in her. But at the same time I thought that every time I see her might be the last time... And every mom's call may bring the bad news about Alice. So I tried to make some photos of her every time I went home. And mom has also been sending me her photos almost every week.

And the bad news call happened 2 days ago. She was mortal. Kidneys. I always knew it'll be kidneys. CKD... I thought it's incurable so there's nothing I can do but there was... I was so fixated on curing CKD that I never thought of curing symptoms. A few weeks ago I ordered a lot of AIM30 supplements but it couldn't make it in time... Uraemia hit her so hard she fell into a coma and died in 2 days. It was 24 hours ago. And I wasn't there. There was nothing I can do. I couldn't visit her in time... Mom treated her like a baby for the last half of the year and especially her last days.

I loved her so much. I still do. But I can't stop blaming myself for not trying to cure her. I know she had a long life. But I could win her a few months at least, maybe years. Meanwhile there could be AIM30 vaccine release and it could save her a few more years... It took me a few hours of asking Grok to figure out how to cure CKD symptoms. Why couldn't I do this at least a year ago... Now I can clearly see in the photos over the last year how she is going through the last CKD stages and looking weaker and weaker... Why haven't I notice it at least a year ago ... And it wasn't impossible to get all the supplements. But we were sure she's immortal... And she seemed so until her last days. Mom buried her in Alice's favorite bed on her favorite blanket...

A part of me just died. A part of the home just died. A part of the family. A part I can never replace. Now I don't know how to come home to mom. Now the home's half empty.

It hurts so much and I feel so much pain. But thank you for reading. I'll actually be so glad to respond to any kind comments.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But I will tell you more about all the attached photos.

1. This is one of our first joint photos. I'm about 6-8 years old. She's about 1-3 years old.

2. This is one of our last joint photos. One of the best. It has been made a year ago. It was the first time I brought my new girlfriend home and she made some photos of me and Alice. Of course, Alice hissed at her and hid behind the couch. But I'm glad I finally introduced them to each other. We were together for more than 4 years at this moment when I actually brought her to my family home.

3, 4. I made these photos during my last home visit at the end of 2024. Dec 27. She still doesn't seem old and sick. She's still fluffy. And her smart eyes... From above she looks like a huge croissant. Her fur color is so unique, I've never seen a cat with a little similar fur color.

5. This is my mom's favorite photo. It has been made about the same time the 1 photo was.

6. This one is one of my favorite photos. It is actually called ""hook tail.jpg"". Mom used to give funny names to all the photos.

7. She's about 11 years old here. Look at these playful intelligent green eyes. I also love her face color pattern so much. White whiskers, white beard, white chest. Soft-pink lips. Sweet black nose. And these black and milk-coffee-ginger halves. And fluffy rabbit ears. She's perfect. I've never met a cat like her.

8. Fluffy tortie bumblebee.

9. Mom loved to dress her in different silly outfits.

10. She used to always come to me when I felt sad. She had infinite positive vibes.

11. She's 20+ here. Such a happy fluffy tortie rabbit. I can't help but smile looking at this photo.

12. 19+. These green eyes... I will never forget them.

13. 19+. She was so curious and inquisitive. What a cat... And these funny teeth and fluffy whiskers.

14. 22 years old. A half a year ago. Even then she used to walk on a balcony enjoying the sunny autumn weather.

15. 22+. A month ago. Even then she used to enjoy the sunny baths. But she started to look old and sick... I still thought she could overcome it...

16, 17. Some younger photos. She always loved the sun. And that smell, you know... Smell of the fluffy cat that has been lying under the sun... That warm sweet smell. This is my favorite smell. And it's so sad I will never fell it again...

18. The last photo. Yesterday. She's almost there. My sweet little Alice kitty...

The announcement of layoffs comes after several other high-profile firings that have taken place across New York since the beginning of 2025. In March, 239 employees were laid off after Staffing Boutique lost a government contract for hiring nonprofit and educational employees. 

This came after Amscan announced that it was eliminating over 500 warehouse jobs in the Hudson Valley due to the bankruptcy of Party City. Smaller companies, like a 90-year-old coffee company that suddenly shuttered its Westchester plant, have also left hundreds of New Yorkers without a job.

He stood back and marveled at his creation. The beauty was breathtaking. What human could possibly go wrong with such an offer? The combining of two souls through the power of the orgasm, a sacred act, binding one soul to another for life. At least, that was the plan. ""That's the last one,"" an angel said, brushing some stardust off of its robe. ""Yes, yes it is,"" replied the Creator, signaling the end of the blueprint phase. The masterwork was done. ""Can I place it into the universal containment chamber now?"" asked the angel, bouncing slightly on the balls of its feet like a kid who couldn't wait to hit ""Start."" The Creator rubbed his beard with a satisfied grin. ""Go ahead. Let's meet my creation."" 

The angel carefully picked up a glowing blue and green orb hovering above the workbench. Eons of planning and borderline obsessive tweaking had all led to this, a sphere called Earth. As he cupped it in his hands, it bobbed gently, almost weightless. Clouds curled across deep oceans. Mountains shifted slightly as tectonic plates settled into place. A few birds took off in panic. He walked toward the universal containment chamber, a swirling abyss of black, peppered with vibrant galactic freckles. Nebulae flared and dimmed like fireworks in slow motion. Stars blinked in and out, some spinning, some collapsing, all of them dancing to a silent symphony. The angel leaned in. ""Let’s see, hmm. Yes. That spiral arm. Quiet little corner. Should be safe for at least a few billion years."" He gently placed the orb into its designated spot. As he retracted his hands, the little blue world shimmered as if it had just taken its first breath. ""Majestic. Truly your best work yet,"" said the angel. The Creator sat down next to the viewing sphere, exhaled deeply, and smiled. ""Now, we observe.""

Millennia passed. The two watched with a kind of divine patience that mortals can’t comprehend. Things didn’t start off too great. ""Oh come on. She was not supposed to eat that,"" muttered the Creator. ""And now they’ve invented shame,"" said the angel, making a face. They tried a few fixes. Kicked some folks out of a garden, flooded things once, added fire, gave them commandments, tried reincarnation, even gave them Australia. Nothing stuck. Eventually, the Creator just stopped meddling. The humans managed to find a way to turn a fool proof plan into fool proofed buggery regardless. So he let them be. 

Then, early one morning, the observation room shook. ""What the bloody hell is happening?"" the Creator yelled, spilling his coffee. The angel squinted into the sphere. ""Why is there a mushroom cloud right there?"" BOOM! Another blast on the other side of the planet. ""Oh no. Ohhh no. That’s not good. They’ve built nuclear bombs."" The Creator sighed. ""I didn’t even think they’d find a way to weaponize the fundamental forces of matter that fast. That’s on me. Rookie move."" A few decades passed. Things calmed. The bombs got buried. Humanity moved on to weirder things, like cryptocurrencies and gluten-free diets.   
  
One day, a small red light blinked on the observation sphere. ""Sir! Sir! The balance! It’s off!"" yelled the angel. The Creator sat upright. ""What do you mean the balance is off?"" ""The soul particles, they’re out of phase. Like, wildly. Something’s overriding the sacred ties. The whole matrix is twitching."" They zoomed in. A bedroom appeared. Neon blue LED lights cast an eerie glow across shelves of anime figurines. In the center: a guy in a gaming chair. His arm, a blur of motion. Speakers crackled out filthy encouragement. ""Yeah baby, that’s it, slap my ass daddy."" The Creator gagged slightly. The angel looked like it wanted to reboot itself. With a final grunt, the young man's legs tensed. A white projectile arced through the air like a tragic firework.   
  
Then it happened, a golden thread sparked out from him, thin, glowing, ethereal. ""Look,"" whispered the angel. ""A soul tie."" It shot across the globe, straight to an address in Hollywood. They zoomed out. More threads. Dozens. Hundreds. Thousands. Soul ties erupting from bedrooms, basements, and VR headsets. Reaching toward webcams, AI voices, OnlyFans accounts, and hentai archives. A writhing tangle of connection and confusion. ""This one’s just gooning 24/7!"" the angel yelled. ""But they were supposed to pair bond! Orgasmic resonance! Mutual transcendence!"" the Creator wailed. ""Sir, we didn’t account for infinite bandwidth!"" The balance wobbled. Contingency fields shorted out. Quantum soul knots unraveled. The web of gooner-ties overloaded the system. ""They're soul bonding to everyone, everything, wait, is that a horse?"" the angel cried. ""Screens. Voices. Cartoon dragons."" ""No,"" whispered the Creator, eyes wide. ""Not the VR modded Skyrim."" And then, it happened.   
  
A tear formed. A singularity birthed by overstimulated, under socialized lust. A goon induced black hole. The soul ties becoming so powerful they began to pull every particle of matter together. Faster than light. More terrible than wrath. Hotter than shame. The universe folded in on itself, devoured by the weight of corrupted soul ties and dopamine burnout. In less than a blink, it was gone. Everything sucked into a singular moment of cosmic post nut clarity.

Pop.

Silence... 

""Well,"" said the angel finally. ""That escalated quickly."" The Creator nodded, rubbing his temples. ""Okay,"" he said slowly. ""New plan. No internet, and maybe cap the balls at one orgasm a day."" ""Smart. Very smart.""   
  
The workbench shimmered back into view. A fresh orb blinked into existence. Blue. Green. Innocent. ""Let's try this again."" And with that, the Creator rolled up his sleeves and got back to work.",3,1744388592.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

I'm just gonna say one thing, let's see wut u all thoughts on it.

1: I highly predict Skirk will overtake Mavuika as strongest DPS. And to be more precisely or say undoubtedly Skirk+Coffee team. Or to be even more precise, Furina as 3rd. 

2: I hope and personally want it to happen so bad for rsns like I'm tired of the insane Mavuika shilling, glazing by both Devs and players lol.

Hi all,

Background 

I'm a bit of a stereotype of a corporate guy that would like to move into the game industry.
I worked in the past as a creative (video production + local journalism), then I transitioned to IT, worked 5 years as a tester and now 3 as product owner.
I manage a growing internal product (in house built web app) while at the same time I contribute to other projects.

After all these years I understand that my place is where my passions are which is games.
I see game producer role as a perfect fit.

I'm looking for some guidance and maybe even a coffee chat if someone is willing to have one 🙂 

My plan for transition:

- apply for producer/associate producer roles
- network in gaming industry. I found a game developer meetup. Any other ideas? I could approach people on LinkedIn, but it feels a bit invasive.
- in the meantime learn as much as possible about game production 

Do you see what else I can do? Should I consider transition steps? Like a Product Owner in a game production company but for eg Java platform?


TLDR:
I’m a Product Owner in finance and I’m looking for ways to transition to game producer in Stockholm.
