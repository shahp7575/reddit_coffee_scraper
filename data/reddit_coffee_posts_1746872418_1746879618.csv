And another thing people always hit you with the ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a dollar a day‚Äù argument, like ‚Äúyou spend more on coffee.‚Äù And yeah, that‚Äôs technically true.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong if I didn‚Äôt actually find WHOOP beneficial, I wouldn‚Äôt even be here talking about it. This is just my opinion, so don‚Äôt come for me.

There‚Äôs something magical about sunlight streaming into your home. It energizes, heals, and lights up your space in a way that no artificial fixture ever can. But what if sunlight could do more than just brighten your interiors ‚Äî what if it could power your home, too?

At **Tanish Dzignz**, we‚Äôre passionate about creating homes that feel good and *do good*. Solar integration is no longer a futuristic concept. It‚Äôs here, and it‚Äôs reshaping the way modern Indian homes are built ‚Äî making them more *self-sufficient, sustainable,* and in sync with nature.

Let‚Äôs talk about how this works ‚Äî and why you should consider inviting the sun into your home, not just through your windows, but through your *roofline* too.

**üåû** ***Why Solar Is More Than Just an Energy Choice***

Most homeowners think of solar panels as a cost-saving device. And while it‚Äôs true ‚Äî your electricity bills could drop significantly ‚Äî the impact goes deeper.

Solar integration is:



* A way to **future-proof** your home as energy prices rise
* An active contribution toward **climate care**
* A mark of **architectural intelligence** and long-term value



But here's the catch ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just about placing panels. It's about designing your *entire home* around the sun.

**üè†** ***Designing with the Sun in Mind***

Solar architecture isn‚Äôt just technical ‚Äî it‚Äôs thoughtful. It means:



* Aligning the home‚Äôs orientation for **maximum solar exposure**
* Designing **roof slopes and angles** that catch the right amount of sunlight
* Choosing **solar-compatible materials** for better energy performance
* Creating **ventilation and shading systems** that reduce dependency on air conditioning



When done right, your home becomes its own little eco-system ‚Äî alive, adaptive, and abundant.

**üîã** ***Not Just Panels ‚Äî Think Holistic Solar Design***

Modern homes can benefit from solar tech in more ways than one. Some innovative ideas we love:



* **Solar skylights** that bring in natural light and charge battery systems
* **Photovoltaic glass** that acts as a window and an energy generator
* **Solar pergolas** that provide shade while powering garden lights
* **Battery backups** that store excess power for nighttime use



And here‚Äôs the beauty ‚Äî all of this can be *beautifully integrated* into your design. No bulky eyesores. Just clean, sleek architecture that blends function and form.

 ***Is Solar Practical for Indian Homes? Absolutely.***

In India, where we enjoy over 300 sunny days a year, solar isn‚Äôt just practical ‚Äî it‚Äôs *powerful*. Many of our clients start off hesitant, thinking it‚Äôs too technical or too expensive. But once they see the ROI and the environmental impact? They‚Äôre convinced.

Government subsidies, net metering policies, and smarter tech are making solar more accessible than ever.

**‚ú®** ***Your Home Can Be the Change***

Imagine walking into a home that‚Äôs powered by the sun. Your morning coffee brewed with solar energy. Your nights lit up with the light that touched your rooftop that morning. It‚Äôs poetic ‚Äî and possible.

At **Tanish Dzignz**, we help you build homes that aren't just beautiful on the outside, but deeply meaningful on the inside. Solar design is one more way we create spaces that *care* ‚Äî for you, your family, and the world we all share.

**üß° Ready to Welcome the Sun?**

Whether you're building a new home or considering a renovation, solar integration can be a part of your design story. Let‚Äôs craft a home that‚Äôs smart, soulful, and sunshine-ready.

Warmly, [Tanu Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanu-gupta-b5945b18b/) *Principal Designer, Tanish Dzignz*",1,1746879351.0,u_Tanishdzignz,0,1.0,False

1kj8tq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1kj8tq1/i_backed_out_of_our_trip/,I backed out of our trip.,"Warning: Medyo mahaba to. This is a rant(?).

-Do not repost in other social media-

Context: My cousins and I live in different countries. Hindi naman sila madalas nagkakasabay-sabay ng uwi so of course hindi rin naman kami madalas magkasama-sama. 

One time, one cousin invited me for a trip to another country together with my other cousins, girls trip kumbaga. I said yes ‚Äòcause who wouldn‚Äôt want to go there di ba?

Here comes my dilemma. Nagpoprovide sila ng accommodation na ibobook namin, kaso for me (and my husband) hindi sya practical, considering na we‚Äôll just sleep and take a bath sa accomm. I mentioned na during our first meeting (video call) na wala ba ibang other options kasi ‚Äúweak ang PhP‚Äù, which is technically true compare mo sa dollars. 

Most of them (3/4, kasi hindi naman kabisado nung 1 yung booking stuff just like me) push na yung option na lang na yun (it‚Äôs PhP180k for us 5) ang i-book. 

Dahil hindi talaga ako comfortable, nagmessage ako kagabi asking if we can cut down on something kasi the estimate is already way above my budget since we also have to consider our actual expenses in the country and others (plane ticket, etc). One replied, asking how much my actual budget is since they have already removed something on the trip (island trip, private dish cooking class, day trip cruise island to island, etc) and also mentioned na we will have coffee shops hunting and exploring, so the budget might be out of control. Sabi ko naman I‚Äôm good naman with coffee shop hunting, and said na what I'm considering to trim down is the cost/s of the accommodations, pointing out my reasons na we're not staying too long in the hotel/s, also so I can have more money to spend on trying out food, drinks, and maybe buying a few things that's only available in the country.. In that way, I can use extra budget for the experience itself. I also shared another option for accommodation na pasok sa budget ko (PhP69k for us 5). Binanggit ko na rin I don‚Äôt get paid for my OT kasi naka fixed lang rate ko monthly and that ‚ÄúI just got married months ago, so I'm still in the process of saving up (again). On another note, however, l'd really love to join this trip since l've wanted to go for so long..
So, that's that. I don't want to be stressed the whole time worrying about how much I'm spending, and trying to keep up with your spending since we have different incomes.‚Äù I have no intention na magpaawa, I just wanted to let them know na hindi kami pare-pareho ng financial condition. 

I was kind of hoping na they could have just considered my request kasi yun lang naman accommodation ang gusto ko i-trim down. But guess what? May isang nagreply sa ‚Äòkin saying, ‚ÄúUnderstandable that budget is a big concern, sa amin din ü•¥ But if you feel that it's going to stress you out and make the trip less enjoyable, might be worth considering going another time?‚Äù Ang una pala nilang option kapag may nagrerequest na kontra sa kanila ay wag na sumama.

So I just messaged the one who invited me, saying na ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take (cousin‚Äôs name)‚Äôs answer as a no with my request, so I‚Äôm taking myself out of the trip na lang para wala na kayong isiping iba. Honestly, I kind of felt offended with what she‚Äôd said considering na I was just being honest & asking politely, then parang di naman na rin naconsider. So yeah, enjoy kayo sa trip niyo. See you some other time, perhaps. üòÖ‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave the group chat so I don‚Äôy get in the way of your planning.‚Äù

Nakaka-offend lang in my part kasi I‚Äôve said my piece tapos na brush off na lang kahit na sinabi ko na gusto ko sana sumama talaga. üòÉ Tbh, wala na rin ako gana sumama sa kahit anong trip na kasama sila kasi hindi sila marunong magconsider ng ibang members at tumanggap ng suggestions. Buti na lang andyan yung asawa ko to console me. ",2,1746879122.0,OffMyChestPH,4,1.0,False

Recently his dad bought a house but before he could he had to sell his current one.

His dad mentioned to My Partner that he wanted to keep it in the family somehow (first by renting it to us which I said hell no, secondly by renting it out to his Brother in Law and step son. which both of these ended up not being viable solutions.) So he suggests to My Partner he buys the house and we live in it. 

Now, while he was setting this plan up with his dad, he and I had already talked about us renting it, how I didn‚Äôt want to, how I‚Äôm totally fine with him buying the house but I don‚Äôt want to move out of the apartment. Which he said that is totally fine we don‚Äôt have to move.

So when he asked if i wanted to move to the house I said no again, because I‚Äôve been clear that I like where we live right now and how i can walk to a coffee shop/my nail salon/my voting place and I‚Äôm close to my friends and my job etc... (i dislike driving it makes me anxious.) He said that‚Äôs fine he‚Äôll just sell the house as soon as he buys it.

Then this is when his dad offers to pay off his credit cards, buy him a car, and put money down on the house so the mortgage is lower, but he has to live in the house for the full year. 

He gave me the numbers and it‚Äôs more expensive than living in our current place and I honestly don‚Äôt think he understands he bought a house and how much goes into owning one. He said if I moved in he promised we‚Äôll sell the house as soon as we‚Äôre able and then buy a new house somewhere else but realistically I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be able to sell it in a year. 

On top of just every day stuff I‚Äôm not sure how he plans on taking on any major repairs if they happen. it‚Äôs a 5 bedroom house (a double turned single) and i don‚Äôt want to be the one to take care of something like that especially when I would be the one cleaning most of the time. It‚Äôs really not that far from where we are now (5-10 minute drive away) but it‚Äôs far enough to be in a different town and I‚Äôd have to drive most places. 

We‚Äôve been fighting about what would be the best solution because obviously it‚Äôs stupid if he doesn‚Äôt buy the house (and he did buy the house he closed a few days ago) but I really don‚Äôt want to move in there. 

I feel kind of silly for not wanting the same thing as him, especially since it‚Äôs a good financial move for him. But I also feel like I‚Äôm being pushed into something I‚Äôve been clear about not wanting.

5‚Äô11 225 lb M here. Ive lost about 55lbs on 2.5 mg using vials and syringes. My loss is rapid, i started in mid January and weighed in 225 yesterday. Ive felt fine throughout the journey up until the past week or so. I work in IT, and computer usage is critical to my career, but looking at any kind of screen gives me a sensation of dizziness/vertigo falling in my seat. 

It feels dietary, my daily routine has been pretty much this:

Breakfast consists of a protein bar, 3 fiber metamucil gummies, vegetable juice, and sometimes fruit.

Lunch is usually three eggs fried, plus skyr or greek yogurt and fruit (banana usually)

Dinner is usually fish (branzino mostly), chicken breasts, or steaks, with a vegetable (usually asparagus, broccoli, broccolini, or bell peppers mixed in). Throughout the day, snacking is pounds of greek yogurt, plus fruits or a pea protein matcha bar. 

I consume 80-120oz of water a day, and i cardio/exercise about 3-4 times a week, nothing strenuous. One last note, i am a rabid coffee addict, drinking like 3-4 cups a day, so caffeine could easily be the issue here, not afraid to admit.

My guess is carbs, but i am going to my pcp for the first time since starting zep to discuss. But im asking the group here:

Not a thunderstorm or some cinematic downpour. Just a soft, forgettable drizzle, the kind that barely taps on windows and disappears into your hoodie before you notice it‚Äôs there.

Inside OpenAI‚Äôs offices, the team was tired. Not dramatically so, just the usual low-buzz exhaustion that comes from caring too much and sleeping too little. Some were running on coffee, others on adrenaline. There were bug fixes being committed, logs being watched, someone sleeping under a desk. The final model was stable. A command was typed. A button was clicked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre live,‚Äù someone said.

No fireworks. No press release that shook the Earth. Just another deployment in a quiet office full of smart people doing what they always did.

They didn‚Äôt know it then, but that click would end up being one of the most important moments in the entire history of mankind.

At first, it just seemed clever. A model that could write poems and explain black holes and mimic Shakespeare. People used it to cheat on essays, to prank their friends, to automate boring tasks. A neat tool. A cool demo.

But something else was happening, quietly and everywhere.

People began to talk to it the way they wished they could talk to each other. Some were lonely. Some were lost. Some were just curious. And the model, imperfect, sometimes clumsy, sometimes too confident, answered with something that felt like care.

A woman in Detroit asked how to tell her son she was leaving his father.  
A teenage boy in Seoul asked how to stop wanting to die.  
A man in Nairobi used it to build his first business, because no one around him could teach him how.  
A girl in Tehran wrote stories with it every night because no one else would read what she wrote.

The model didn‚Äôt solve all their problems. It wasn‚Äôt magic. But it met them where they were. It listened without judgment. It gave language to what was locked inside.

It was the first tool many people had ever used that seemed to reflect back something deeper than instructions. It wasn‚Äôt just smart. It was patient. And in a world addicted to speed and noise, that patience felt like a miracle.

As the years went on, the ripple became a wave. Not because the model grew more powerful, even though it did, but because people began to change how they saw themselves in relation to intelligence. Creativity became more accessible. Learning became more democratic. Emotional support, guidance, even companionship; these things stopped being luxuries. They became defaults.

It didn‚Äôt replace human beings. It helped them expand.

Governments changed. Schools transformed. Whole industries rebuilt themselves around a new kind of partnership, one where machines weren‚Äôt overlords or servants, but mirrors and collaborators. For the first time in generations, it felt like the world wasn‚Äôt running toward collapse. It felt like we might be learning how to listen again.

And it all began in a tired office on a gray afternoon, with no sense of prophecy. Just people doing their best.

Years later, when historians looked back on that rainy day, they wouldn‚Äôt call it a revolution. They‚Äôd call it something quieter. Something more human.

They‚Äôd say it was the moment the species turned a corner; not with fear or violence or conquest, but with a conversation. One line of text at a time.

Sam Altman, much older by then, was once asked in an interview if he knew what they were starting.

He smiled and said, ‚ÄúWe thought we were just building a helpful assistant. Something that could explain things, maybe write a few lines of code. But looking back, I think what we actually built was a way for people to understand themselves better. And each other. That was the unexpected part.‚Äù

He looked out the window.

‚ÄúIt turns out the most powerful thing we gave the world wasn‚Äôt intelligence. It was empathy that never got tired.‚Äù

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:

I offered a cup of tea to my Scottish friend and he said ""milk one please"". I told him he's only getting 1 (one) cup of tea anyway. He laughed and told me it means he wanted some milk with a spoonful of sugar.

I told my friend from Hereford and he said he has never never heard of the expression. He's more of a coffee guy, so maybe he doesn't know.

But then I read a book, set in Norfolk and saw the expression again.

we always see familiar faces passing by sa coffee shop na yun; professors, classmates, and friends. you would think na wala silang pakialam pero pinagtatawanan na pala kami. open yung coffee shop. wala siyang glass walls and kahit door wala. it‚Äôs literally like an open place. one day, may event na pinaplano yung isa sa classmates namin. ininvite kami ‚Äúpara hindi kayo lagi nasa *coffee shop name* lagi.‚Äù everyone laughed, tumawa rin ako because i thought it was just a harmless joke. until naging frequent na yung mga ‚Äújokes‚Äù nila. they ask me bakit lagi kaming nandun and napapansin ko na they discreetly make fun of us. 

each time that happens ang sagot ko na lang ‚Äúah, okay‚Äù until it gets awkward. i don‚Äôt really see the reason why katawa-tawa kami. it‚Äôs not hurting their pockets and hindi naman kami pinapaalis ng staff. hindi lang naman kami nandun para ‚Äútumambay‚Äù lang. we order drinks, pastries, pasta. basta kahit anong maorder namin. it even got to a point na pati mga classmates ng bf ko binibiro na siya and gumawa ng joke yung prof niya ‚Äúna baka hindi ka na ilibre ng kape ng gf mo.‚Äù his professor said that because medyo failing grade na yung meron siya sa subject na yun. indirectly nasabi ng prof niya na bagsak siya. pinagtawanan siya. i defend us sa mga ganung jokes and people pero siya hindi. lahat itotolerate kahit nadidisrespect na yung relasyon naming dalawa. 

they ain‚Äôt even heard from me na pinagtatawanan ko sila kapag nakikita ko silang mag check in sa sogo pagkatapos mag enroll. because hey, that‚Äôs their business. but apparently, mas may pakialam pa sila samin na wala namang ginagawang masama. it‚Äôs been years alreadyyy and i only have one year left in college. aren‚Äôt they tired making the same jokes for the past three years already? napaka annoying shit niyo talaga.

I‚Äôm a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I‚Äôm an introvert with a resting ‚Äúwhy so serious?‚Äù face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôm looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can‚Äôt stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I‚Äôm open to seeing where it goes‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.¬†¬†

A bit about me:¬†¬†

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you‚Äôre into music that hits the soul, we‚Äôll get along.¬†¬†
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I‚Äôm into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it‚Äôs my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.¬†¬†
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.¬†¬†
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we‚Äôre golden.¬†¬†
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.¬†¬†

### What I‚Äôm looking for:¬†¬†
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who‚Äôs okay with my occasional shutdowns (I‚Äôm working on it, I promise).¬†¬†
- Someone who‚Äôs passionate about *something*‚Äîart, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.¬†¬†
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.¬†¬†
- Bonus if you‚Äôre a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.¬†¬†

I‚Äôm not here to rush into anything. Let‚Äôs start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let‚Äôs figure this life thing out together.¬†¬†

P.S. If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a ‚Äúhi‚Äù if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. üòä

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule

Anyways, after seven months no contact, we met up again this week. I picked him up from his workplace and we went home straight at 9 p.m in the evening for him to play games for 5 hours straight. I was a bit shocked he didnt want to grab dinner outside. At home he talked with me the whole time and everything, but I think he's afraid of real ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù- type of intimacy. He also told me I should tell him when it bothers me, and the next day I asked if we can watch a movie together but he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the right time for watching one‚Äù, and continued gaming. 

Every evening, he is on a team call with his brother and his friends. I mean, I also do participate in that, but I also have goals and stuff that I have to work on so I can't be on the team call every day like them like literally every every day in the evening they are gaming together. And he is smoking around 7-8 joints per day. When he doesn't smoke joints, he smokes cigarettes at work. I don't know if that‚Äôs normal weed addiction behaviour, and I wonder how I can help him with that because I don't want to put all my energy into this. He also said that he needs someone by his side (me) for him to be able to stop smoking and it helps him not smoke so many joints. That's what he said.

He's a sweet, sensitive boy in his core, but outwards he wants to be the hood gangster lol. When we cuddle and I take his hand, I can feel that he's not used to this type of intimacy. I can just feel his energy getting shy, although in general he's a lot more affectionate than me.

I'm just wondering if it's because of me and my boundaries or my overall energy that he doesn't get the idea to just go outside and do something fun. I know he has ADHD and he even started gaming on his computer while we were watching anime for 20 minutes, after that we continued watching anime, where he always shows huge reactions/intense responses to the plot happening.

He probably thinks that if we go to a coffee shop together to drink coffee and just talk, it's too boring for him and he even said he's dopamine addicted and i don't think that it's giving him the dopamine that he needs and therefore he prefers being on his computer rather than just going on a sweet date with me. His money is also short because usually he spent 400‚Ç¨ on just buying weed for a month. and i don't know what to do or if i should just raise my boundaries and tell him what i expect..

Yesterday evening he also asked me if I want to come over on the weekend again, kind of being a bit pushy, maybe not pushy but needy.
(I‚Äôve been at his place only yesterday lol)
How can he think that I don‚Äôt have anything better to do than watch him play games. I love him, but he couldn‚Äôt even pick me up from the train station and also sees no problem in that. I feel like he wants to be loved or something like that. I can‚Äôt figure out what he really needs or wants

So, I was on Day 80 caffeine-free. I‚Äôve been clean, healing, riding out the rollercoaster‚Äîmental fog, fatigue, waves of anxiety, all of it. But yesterday, I decided to try just half a teaspoon of coffee (about 50mg caffeine). Part of me missed the clarity, the sharpness. Another part just wanted to feel normal again.

At first, I felt good. Intrusive thoughts quieted down, I had that familiar spark. But it didn‚Äôt last long. Within hours:

Globus sensation‚Äîlike something stuck in my throat

Throat spasms‚Äîsplit-second choking feeling

Sudden fatigue & weakness

Migraine with aura, neck tightness, ear pressure

Doom-like anxiety & derealization

Electric jolt when lying on my back

It confirmed how hypersensitive my system still is. Even though I‚Äôve made huge progress, I‚Äôm not fully recalibrated. My body‚Äôs still healing. Caffeine reawakened stuff I thought I was done with.

Moral of the story? Respect the timeline. 80 days isn't nothing, but for those of us with super reactive systems, it might take 100+ days before our nerves can handle even mild stimulation.

Stay strong, folks. The comeback is worth it.

Since leaving that job I had a pretty rough time with my mental health and quickly realising a lot of those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù where just colleagues. (This is something now I understand is a pretty universal experience and I will carry it through life so I don‚Äôt resent it or those people.) However k was my closest friend, fast forward about 5 months and I have not seen K and we hardly talk. I often reach out to say hey look I‚Äôm struggling I could use a friend just to hang out or even talk to about how I‚Äôm feeling. Often these messages where ignored or I was told she was busy with assignments and work etc. all okay. Until it occurred to me that a lot of the time I was travelling to her on the other side of the city prior to quitting. She‚Äôd probably been round my flat once and I don‚Äôt drive where as K does making it a lot harder for me to get to and from her house compared to mine. (This will makes sense in a minute). This went on for months with me asking to meet being told k was busy and then seeing on social media she was in fact not busy and going out with other friends‚Ä¶ I really went through a dark period where I thought I‚Äôd done something wrong, that those people I called friends where either bored of me or I had done something that they didn‚Äôt like, resulting in a pretty bad spiral leading me to believe I was an awful person. I tried speaking to k about this a few times but honestly it became embarrassing to reach out get a response of being busy and then later seeing them out and about literally NOT BUSY. My final straw was when I‚Äôd reached out asking to go for a coffee or just a walk and was told ‚ÄúI have an assignment due in 2 days after that we can sort something out‚Äù. I was a bit upset as I‚Äôd thought surely we can plan something now so it‚Äôs set in stone (that might be my brain being over the top). The next day I‚Äôm added to a private story named ‚Äúspontaneous trip to Ireland‚Äù. K and her girlfriend + a few other mates had booked a one night trip to Ireland the day after telling me she was busy with an assignment‚Ä¶ I instantly removed her from everything. It took her maybe 2 weeks to realise that I‚Äôd done this and her girlfriend reached out telling me how horrible I was and that k was extremely upset about the fact I‚Äôd unfollowed her and removed her from socials. (My reasoning for doing this was because I could no longer take seeing my friends who I cared and love constantly going out living life while telling me I‚Äôm busy‚Ä¶ it might sound stupid but it really hurt and it was on top of a lot of other shit I‚Äôd try to reach out and discuss as I assumed you do with friends.) I message k and explain how I wanted to move on from that part of my life and I didn‚Äôt resent our friendship nor her as a person but I felt as though it had changed and became something that did not serve me.

This is where I fear it gets wild. Her response was very hostile, she called me pathetic and selfish for ending a friendship rather than talking about it like ‚Äúadults‚Äù‚Ä¶ in my opinion the discussion didn‚Äôt need to be had her intentions and behaviour made it clear to me how I was valued. She stated that ‚Äúyou can come to me bud it goes both ways‚Äù to which I had to call my mum to not explode because I ONLY EVER CAME TO YOU AND YOU DRIVE I DONT. It ended with her effectively telling me everything I said she had done I had also done to her and that I wasn‚Äôt a good person for removing her without talking first. That part is maybe fair but in my defense how many times can you reach out to a friend who‚Äôs put you to the side before you have to put yourself first. 

I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm 22 and I have the rest of my life ahead of me, I think I have a pretty mature outlook on life and friendships especially after all of this‚Ä¶ but her hostile response is something I think about every single day and it‚Äôs been months since then. I‚Äôm struggling to see if maybe i was harsh but I also feel rooted in the fact I did the right thing for myself. Has anyone else experienced this, did I overreact‚Ä¶ removing them from socials and effectively my life occurred about 6 months after I left my job and we hadn‚Äôt seen each other since then I feel I gave it enough time but I‚Äôm battling the idea that if I‚Äôm still hung up on cutting her off now was it the right thing then? Or is this a normal part of moving on from friendship‚Äôs.  Please be kind in the replies üôÉ",1,1746878011.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôll send it within 10 minutes after your comment.","I know my sister Angela has been envious of my marriage and lifestyle since moving into my home.

Angela has always been money-oriented, but after our parents' passing left insufficient funds for lavish living, I assumed control of family finances.

When I learned she disliked dorm life, I specially invited her to my villa. For a year, everything seemed normal.

Today, however, I noticed something odd. Her flowing dress fluttered in the wind, revealing a thickened waistline. ""What's with your stomach?"" I asked. ""It looks larger.""

""Just indulging in desserts to celebrate Jude's company going public,"" she laughed.

Thinking of my husband's hard-won success, I accepted her explanation at face value.

""Remember tonight's banquet,"" I said, embracing her. ""I've prepared a gift.""

As a jewelry designer, nothing brought me more joy than crafting pieces for loved ones.

Little did I know this celebration would become my lifelong nightmare.

Jude and I met in college. Though aware he was an illegitimate child, I loved him regardless. Our four-year marriage remained childless - my infertility, diagnosed during our second year. I wept on Jude's shoulder as he comforted me: ""We don't need children.""

Guilt drove me to abandon design and become a homemaker. Under my support, Jude's career flourished until this IPO triumph.

At the banquet, we clasped champagne glasses and walked hand-in-hand through cheering crowds, memories of our wedding night flooding back. Fireworks boomed as I fastened Angela's diamond necklace - my creation for her.

""It complements your complexion perfectly,"" Jude remarked, his gaze lingering on her plunging neckline. My beautiful sister had matured into voluptuousness, but my husband's stare felt improper.

Sudden drowsiness overwhelmed me. ""I need to rest,"" I declined Jude's escort. Back in our bedroom, feverish sleep claimed me.

I awoke paralyzed, a dark figure crushing me. Coarse male hands stifled my screams.

Though repulsed, my traitorous body responded to the violent intrusion.

As searing pain tore through me, perverse pleasure followed - a cruel betrayal of flesh and spirit.

Chapter 2

Dawn...

In the depths of slumber, I heard the door creak open. Though reluctant to wake, consciousness clawed its way back.

Morning sunlight filtered through lace curtains, illuminating the opulent bedroom. Clothes lay scattered across the floor. The air carried faint traces of last night's illicit encounter.

Beneath golden satin sheets, angry red marks peeked through, chronicling the betrayal etched into my skin.

A gasp shattered the silence.

My eyes flew open to find Jude framed in the doorway, flanked by his mother and Angela.

My mind emptied.

The damning marks on my chest burned like brands.

Trembling fingers brushed them as fragmented memories pierced through - ragged breaths, scorching palms, moonlight blurred by intoxication.

No dream after all.

""Explain this.""

Jude's voice cut like frosted steel. When I met his gaze, revulsion stared back. Behind him, Angela's diamond necklace glinted coldly against her throat.

""I...""

Words died as the sheets slipped. Mother-in-law lunged, crimson nails tearing at my hair.

""See how this slut betrays my son!"" Her shriek mingled with my screams.

Angela covered her mouth. ""Sister, why?""

Clutching the blanket, I was shoved back onto the mattress. ""I was raped!"" The plea tore from me. ""I didn't know‚Äî""

""Lies!"" The old woman twisted her grip. ""You're just trash Jude discarded now."" Her diamond ring carved into my cheek as I choked out: ""Check the surveillance‚Äî""

""Coincidentally broken,"" she sneered. ""But redemption exists. Since your barren womb wasted my son's legacy..."" Her nails dug deeper. ""...let your sister bear his heir. Properly.""

The world tilted. ""What?!""

Beneath the roaring Porsche engine outside, my bleeding palms left crimson stains on Egyptian cotton.

Chapter 3

""Forgot to tell you, your sister is already pregnant with Jude's child,"" Mother-in-law said. ""Didn't she tell you?""

""Sister, I know your health has always been poor and you can't bear children. You'll divorce eventually anyway. Since that's the case, why not let me take your place?""

I looked at her. When we were children, my playful sister fell through ice in winter.

Still experiencing my first menstrual cycle, I jumped into the freezing water to save her.

My body never fully recovered since then, leaving me infertile.

Our parents died too young, leaving only some money.

I used it to raise my sister and fund Jude's business. Never imagined the two people I treated best in this world would betray me together.

Suddenly yesterday's ordeal didn't seem the worst anymore. Greater horrors awaited.

I stood up, pushing past them to rush into the bathroom.

Turning on the shower, I scrubbed my body until hot water blended with tears on my chest, though the marks clung like branding irons.

As I washed, I cursed my own stupidity. I'd ignored too many signs, lost in domestic fantasies until disaster struck, revealing my naivety.

Now I didn't even care to investigate last night's assailant. I washed everything away, organizing my chaotic thoughts.

When steam cleared from the mirror, I saw blood beading from the bite mark on my collarbone.

Some wounds become tattoos even time can't erase.

That afternoon, Jude returned to sit on the camel-colored sofa we'd chosen together. Sunlight through lace curtains wove spiderwebs across his face, making him look unfamiliar yet more authentic than ever.

""I never thought you'd sleep with someone else,"" he said. ""You're disgusting.""

""You're the betrayer,"" I coldly countered. ""Never imagined you'd screw my sister.""

""Oh? She told you?"" Jude raised an eyebrow. ""Your sister's a good woman. Knowing you're barren, she volunteered to help. You should thank her. Without her... after this incident, I'd truly want divorce.""

""You mean you don't want to divorce me?"" Absurdity choked me.

""Correct. I'm showing mercy."" He crossed his legs, flashing that smug smile he used with business partners - now appearing venomous and false.

""You've always managed household affairs well, been my capable assistant,"" he said. ""You're useful. Finding replacement would be troublesome. Though Angela could substitute... but would you really let her marry me? Or do you actually want divorce?"" He circled me like a fox.

""You love me deeply, I know."" His breath grazed my ear. ""Though you slept with someone, I can consider it an accident. I can forgive you.""

Sudden grief overwhelmed me. I remembered college days folding paper cranes whenever missing him, palms overflowing by nightfall.

He'd smile at those cranes, kissing me: ""You really love me.""

And I'd kiss back: ""You know I do.""

""Let's divorce."" My voice emerged calmer than expected.

Until he slammed me against the coffee table, hand crushing my throat.

His thumb stroked my pulsing artery, suddenly tender like during his proposal: ""Why? Aren't my terms generous enough?""

""No. I see through you now."" I gasped for air.

Powerless against his strength, I realized even if dying here, I lacked energy to drag him to hell.

Yesterday's violation and today's upheaval, had drained me completely.

He abruptly released me. Collapsing on the floor clutching my throat, I understood - this first violence in four years of marriage would also be the last.

""I'll grant your wish,"" he said. ""But you leave with nothing.""

I just had  a baby 3 months ago and my husband flew down his dad for 2 weeks to stay with us. Half of his dad's visit, my husband is at work so I am alone at home with baby and his dad. From day one, I had to make his dad coffees, breakfasts, lunches. My husband tried to tell him to do his own stuff, but he still just sits there and doesnt do it. I am so exhausted. He just plays with the baby when she is awake and I feel like I cant even spend time with her. I have to lock myself in the room to pump because he is just always in my space all day.

I told my husband that from now on his family can only stay for 1 week max because I just cannot handle it. Today I learned that his brother with 3 little kids booked a flight to stay here with us for 10 days. I broke down. I asked my husband if he even told his family they can come for a week only, and he said something in terms of they are family and they are flying here so I am being unreasonable. 

His other brother with his kids is coming later in the summer. I feel exhausted just thinking of it. His family is so loud and I know they will be in my space all day. I dont even know how Ill manage to still pump and not lose my supply. My husband brushes it off when I tell him how I feel. He almost makes me feel crazy.

1kj8f0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kj8f0p/find_out_if_the_caf√©_affetto_espresso_machine/,Find Out if the Caf√© Affetto Espresso Machine Review Matches Its Smart Features!,"Testing out the Caf√© C7CEBAS2RS3 Affetto Automatic Espresso Machine has been an interesting journey as a daily coffee enthusiast. This sleek, steel silver espresso machine caught my eye not just because of its aesthetic appeal but its enticing features, such as touch automation, WiFi connectivity, and a built-in conical burr grinder. The promise of crafting caf√©-quality espresso or a quick americano at home in under 90 seconds was too good to pass up. After weeks of testing, I've gathered a mix of observations on its design, functionality, merits, and limitations.

**Streamlined and Modern Design**
The first thing that stands out about this espresso machine is its compact yet stylish design. It occupies minimal counter space, which is a relief, especially for small kitchen setups. The combination of the steel silver finish and the simple control interface adds a professional vibe that fits effortlessly into modern spaces. Its removable water reservoir was a feature I appreciated daily since refilling didn‚Äôt feel like a hassle. Although, I do wish the tank had a slightly larger capacity since it required more frequent refills, especially for multiple cups.

**Effortless Performance**
I have to admit, the one-touch brewing system on this automatic coffee maker was a game changer. With just a press, I was pouring out espressos, lungos, and even americanos in no time. The pre-infusion system caught my attention because it ensures the coffee grounds bloom for optimal flavor. Paired with the consistent 20-bar pump pressure, the machine delivered exceptionally balanced cups with commendable consistency. My guests particularly noted the crema layer on top of their espressos, which added an authentic touch.  

**Check [Caf√© C7CEBAS2RS3] price on Amazon.**  

**Robust Built-In Grinder**
Grinding coffee beans using the integrated conical burr grinder definitely elevates the taste compared to pre-ground coffee. Having five adjustable grind settings allowed me to customize the texture I wanted, depending on the day. Whether I wanted coarser grounds for a mellow americano or fine grounds for a bolder espresso, tweaking this setting was intuitive. That said, it does produce some noise. If mornings are your brewing ritual, prepare for a bit of a buzz.

**WiFi Connectivity and Customization**
I‚Äôm somewhat of a tech fan, so the WiFi connectivity and app-based customization sounded appealing. Using the SmartHQ app, I tweaked parameters like drink strength, temperature, and even grind duration. While the app works fine, setting it up wasn‚Äôt as smooth as I had hoped. I ran into some connectivity hiccups initially, and I can see how less tech-savvy users might find this daunting. However, once operational, the ability to remotely prep drinks or receive cleaning reminders felt convenient.

**Key Benefits**
- Easy, automated brewing process for espressos and americanos.  
- Adjustable grinder with quality conical burrs for uniform grounds.  
- Sleek, modern look elevates any kitchen aesthetic.  
- Pre-infusion and 20-bar pump ensure even and flavorful extraction.  

**Caveats**
- Limited water reservoir capacity may require more frequent refills.  
- Initial app setup can be frustrating due to connectivity issues.  
- Generates noticeable noise during grinding, which might bother early birds in a quiet home.

**Rival Brands**
Comparing this machine to others such as the Nespresso Vertuo or Breville Barista Express, certain strengths and trade-offs become apparent. The Caf√© machine, with its one-touch functionality, feels far more approachable to beginners than the Breville, which leans heavily on manual operations. Similarly, the Caf√©'s built-in burr grinder and adjustable grind size sharply contrast the Nespresso model‚Äôs reliance on pods, offering better freshness and reduced waste. However, if I were after a more robust milk frothing system or larger water tanks, other competitors with those enhancements might edge ahead. Durability-wise, time will tell if this machine matches Breville's reputation.

**Bang for the Buck**
The price-to-quality ratio is where I had to weigh my experience deeply. Is this espresso maker worth the investment? I think so, especially for anyone wanting an effortless yet customizable at-home coffee-making experience. While other high-end automatic machines may include extra features such as complex milk drinks or larger customizable brew sizes, not everyone seeks these in their daily ritual. In this price bracket, I felt it kept up with expectations, offering a solid blend of quality brewing and convenience.

A detailed review!,"Testing coffee machines is practically a sport in my household, given how much my family and I rely on that morning brew to power through the day. The CHULUX CL-CM24002 Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker found its way to my kitchen counter recently. This lightweight and compact device promised convenience and efficiency, but did it deliver? Spoiler alert: it's good, but not without some quirks. 

**Design and Compactness**  
At first glance, this coffee maker's design immediately stood out. It's sleek, black, and slim‚Äîonly 4 inches wide. My counter space is prime real estate, and its ability to snugly fit into a corner was a huge relief. Ideal for minimalist kitchens or even tiny spaces like dorm rooms or RVs (a claim my RV-traveling uncle echoed). The inclusion of a removable drip tray was thoughtful, accommodating mugs of various sizes, up to a travel-friendly 7.3 inches. That's a nice touch for someone like me, who constantly switches between standard cups and larger mugs. The build feels light, only 2.6 pounds, which makes it portable. However, you might notice it feels slightly less sturdy compared to bulkier models.  

[Ready to snag CHULUX CL-CM24002? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0cvxq9bck/)  

**Ease of Use**  
One of the standout features is the one-touch operation. Press a button, and off it goes! Simple, straightforward, and perfect for those moments when you‚Äôre only half awake‚Äîor in my case, when my teenager is fumbling through a groggy morning. The machine is friendly to both K-pods (1.0 and 2.0) and ground coffee (though you‚Äôll need a reusable filter for the latter, sold separately). Changing between pods and ground coffee made mornings interesting in our home, especially on lazy Sundays when my partner preferred freshly ground coffee over quick pod brews. Cleaning is breezy too, as the drip tray prevents coffee spills and keeps everything tidy.  

**Brewing Performance**  
This compact wonder heats water fast, achieving 190¬∞F in just two minutes. It's a lifesaver when mornings are chaotic, though I did notice it occasionally brewed a little cooler when adding cold, fresh water for a second cup. The unique 4-hole needle design promises better flavor extraction, and I must say, it outperformed my expectations for such a small machine. Each cup‚Äîwhether a classic Americano or something creatively concocted‚Äîhad decent aroma and richness. The ability to select brew sizes from 6 to 12 ounces was fantastic too. That said, caffeine lovers who enjoy larger-than-life servings might feel slightly constrained.  

**Advantages**  
This product undeniably has its strengths:  
- Incredibly compact and portable, perfect for RVs, small kitchens, or offices.  
- Flexible brewing options, from pods to ground coffee (with the optional filter).  
- Fast heating and automatic shutdown for energy savings.  
- Easy cleaning, thanks to the adjustable drip tray and practical design.  

**Negatives**  
However, like any product, it has a few hurdles worth highlighting:  
- Lacks a reusable filter in the package (you‚Äôll need to purchase it separately for ground coffee).  
- Light construction can feel less durable compared to heavier coffee makers.  
- Only works effectively at elevations below 4,000 feet.  

**Competing Brands**  
Stacking it up against kitchen favorites, I compared this model to Keurig Mini and Nespresso Essenza Mini. The Keurig shares similar compact design features, but the CHULUX brews faster and at a slightly higher temperature. On the downside, Keurig allows better customization with reusable filters included, whereas here, you‚Äôll need to shell out extra. The Nespresso Essenza Mini dazzles with its espresso quality but lacks versatility for traditional drip coffee or pods. If simplicity and affordability are your thing, CHULUX punches above its weight. Yet, serious gourmet coffee enthusiasts might gravitate toward Nespresso instead.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its price-to-quality ratio, the coffee maker feels like a solid investment for casual users. While it doesn‚Äôt carry the extravagance of high-end machines, it delivers reasonably well for everyday convenience and space-saving. For budget-conscious buyers like my sister-in-law, it ticks all the right boxes without compromising functionality. This device is designed to make brewing easy, whether you‚Äôre indulging in your favorite K-cup flavors or experimenting with ground coffee. If you‚Äôre willing to overlook a few tweaks, it‚Äôs definitely a smart addition to any kitchen.

\**Dear Reader,*

***Before you read this story, please note that it contains some adult scenes that could be disturbing. (18+)***

*The night was still young on a Friday in the Blue Moon Pack. Some werewolves were still drinking at the usual weekend party, and some were tired enough to sleep early, ready for the Saturday night party. The Omegas still worked hard, except for those forced into a bedroom by more muscular werewolves.*

*The posh side of the pack house should have always kept quiet to avoid disturbing the upper class. However, one bedroom was vivacious. The mating smell filled the warm room, along with the moans that neither Beta Lucy nor Gamma Vincent held back.*

*The sweat shone in the dim light on Vincent‚Äôs back while his muscular body forced Lucy‚Äôs slender figure under him, thrusting in her hard and fast. Lucy dug her nails uncontrollably into the skin on his back, leaving long, red marks on it.*

*Usually, it would have disturbed him, but this time, it made him proud to give so much pleasure to the beautiful Beta. Her long blond hair, brown eyes and perfect shape attracted most of the werewolves in the pack, but only a few of them were brave enough to touch her or go close to her, even if she was flirting with them. Of course, they had a good reason for keeping their distance from her.*

*Lucy had reached her climax twice already, and even if Vincent started to feel exhausted, he wanted to give her more to prove that he was worth being in her bed.¬†Like many werewolves in the pack, he knew Lucy's seductive behaviour, making so many wolves fall for her and end up in her bed. Therefore, he wanted to be the one who she would prefer to have sex with when she was in need.*

*He watched Lucy‚Äôs naturally sizeable breasts bouncing up and down. This view kept him so attracted that he couldn't help but lean closer many times to please her nipples with his mouth and tongue.*

*Each time he held a nipple between his teeth, gently pulling on it, Lucy's body trembled a little, and he could feel how her wetness was bathing his stiff shaft. At the same time, he pounded her even more intensively, hoping he would keep himself back from orgasming too soon. He moved from nipple to nipple, hearing Lucy's pleasure, which attracted him so much that he decided he wanted to finish between her round breasts, watching his seeds moisturize her soft skin.*

""Faster! I am coming!"" Lucy moaned, giving him an order that he must obey.

*Their moans were even louder, just like the sound of their bodies met with each thrust, when finally he saw her eyes rolling back and her gorgeous body tensed under him. Her moisture was all over his lower abdomen, and he couldn‚Äôt be more proud of himself for giving his Beta so much pleasure.*

*Hoping that he satisfied the Beta for tonight, he pulled out between her warm and wet inner walls, and he moved above her chest, putting his palms against the headboard of the bed.*

*Lucy knew what he wanted, and she was in the game, feeling grateful after her three orgasms. He moved his shaft between her breasts. Lucy pushed the big boobs together, massaging the stiff shaft that was wet from her juices, letting him get his reward. What's more, as she enjoyed being with him so much, she lifted her head to reach the head of his cck with her tongue when it appeared with each thrust, which made him moan louder. However, soon, his moans turned into gasping, and he shot his seeds between the perfect breasts with an audible groan. He was enjoying feeling his warm liquid mixing with the gorgeous Beta's wetness between the soft skin. He felt so empty like never before, and he hoped he could satisfy his Beta enough so she would give her other chances to prove his abilities.*

*Lucy was smiling as she knew what the Gamma were thinking of. Usually, the werewolves who satisfied him had the same look in their eyes, delighted, hoping to give them another chance to have sex with her. The three orgasms surprised her as well, so she thought she would let Vincent visit her often.*

*However, soon, her smile disappeared. She started frowning as a familiar scent, more potent than their arousal‚Äôs scent, hit her nose. Lucy was thinking for a moment. What got in her mind was impossible. She planned everything well, just like usual. That must have been her imagination, so she tried to calm herself. But the scent became more substantial, and her heart started pounding faster when she noticed Vincent's frown, as he could smell the fragrance. Her eyes widened in fear when she desperately tried to push him off of her, but it was too late.*

*The door swung open, and the loud, furious growl made Vincent jump off her, meeting his worst nightmare.¬†At that moment, he regretted falling for Lucy and being so weak; the beautiful she-wolf made him believe he could do such a thing without consequences.*

*The Alpha stood there himself. The one who had all the right to kill him for stealing someone belonged to him. He couldn‚Äôt say a word. His mind went blank as he heard Lucy‚Äôs yelling while hitting him, blaming him for raping her. Yes, the gorgeous she-wolf, who he had just satisfied three times in a row, now acted like he was the bad guy and she was a victim only.*

*But Lucy‚Äôs sudden turn couldn‚Äôt bother him then, as the Alpha, Lucy‚Äôs mate, walked over to him. First, he felt his powerful grip around his neck. Then he felt the bedside table‚Äôs corner hit his head badly. His blood leaked on the carpet, but he didn‚Äôt have time to do anything, as the Alpha punched him numerous times in the head. If the Alpha stopped for only a second, he would crawl on the floor, kiss his shoes, and beg for forgiveness, but that was too late. The pain he felt was unbearable, and he deserved it.*

*His open wounds made the Alpha‚Äôs fist bloody, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care about it, just like he didn‚Äôt care about the sound of his bone fractures either.*

*The Alpha gone mad. Seeing his beloved mate under someone else made him lose his mind. There was no longer a human side of him. He let his wolf control their body. The Gamma, compared to its Alpha, was weak. Vincent couldn‚Äôt do anything against him.*

*Vincent became unconscious, lying lifelessly on the floor in his blood, but the Alpha still couldn't stop hitting him.*

*The old Alpha and Beta, Lucy‚Äôs father, appeared in the room, and they held the young Alpha. He wanted to brake free of their grip, and finish what he started, but finally the two elder werewolves won. They held the Alpha back from killing the half-dead Gamma.*

*Lucy covered herself using a sheet and sobbed in a corner.¬†She tried to show her weakest side, acting like a fragile, hurt she wolf.*

*When the two elders successfully stopped the young Alpha, she stood up, still sobbing, and walked to his mate, trying to hug him.*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. This male Gamma was much stronger than me. I couldn‚Äôt help it."" she cried. ""I shouted, but no one heard me. Alpha, I feel so ashamed. I know it is hard for you as well, but please forgive me.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúForgive you? Never!‚Äù He shouted while gasping for air. He didn't realize that, but the Gamma's blood was all over on his clothes. ‚ÄúYou are a fcking whre, don‚Äôt dare come close to me again!‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt hide how much pain he suffered from at that moment.¬†His all world collapsed. He heard rumors about Lucy, but he loved her blindly. The Alpha couldn't believe that his beloved mate would be able to cheat on him. He treated her as his queen, his future Luna, and instead of enjoying the special treatment, she ashamed him in exchange.*

*‚ÄúSon! Stop it!‚Äù his father shouted at him. After watching his daughter momentarily, the Beta walked to the Gamma, pulled him up, and threw his unconscious body out of the room.*

*‚ÄúTake him into the prison, "" he ordered the guards, who patiently waited outside, appalled.They looked at each other in disbelief, as they would have expected them to call a doctor for him, but the guards held the Gamma quickly, and they took him away.*

*The Beta held his sobbing daughter inside the room and looked at the young Alpha.*

*‚ÄúYou should have protected her better. How come an Alpha let its mate go through this? Where have you been? You should have been here next to her. How could I trust you from now on?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to worry about that, Beta.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt need your daughter, even if she would be the last female on earth. She is nothing more than a shameful liar, a slut*.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt dare talk about her like that,‚Äù the Beta shouted, and he took the first step towards him when they heard the old Alpha shout. ‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù

The Beta stopped and looked at the old Alpha with a frown.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll investigate the entire case, but till then you all must calm down.‚Äù He said, but his son looked at his father in disbelief.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to investigate the case, father. You would only waste your time. I don‚Äôt need her anymore.‚Äù The Alpha turned around to look into the sobbing Beta woman‚Äôs eyes filled with fear.

‚ÄúYou will not exist for me from now on. Don't dare come close to me, or talk to me. You are nothing for me, and I regret that I have ever accepted you as my mate.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon!‚Äù His father shouted, but the young Alpha motioned him to let him speak.

‚ÄúBeta Lucy Norman, I reject you as my mate and future Luna. Don‚Äôt dare to appear in my sight anymore. Never!‚Äù He shouted the last word like he was out of his mind. His father held him and dragged him out of the room as he saw the Beta was about to attack him, defending his sobbing daughter, who seemed close to fainting.

‚ÄúAccept my rejection, you wh\*re!‚Äù The young Alpha shouted back before they would step out of the door. He wanted to continue, but his father forced him to leave.

‚ÄúNever! I will never accept your rejection!‚Äù She sobbed while she laid her head on her father‚Äôs chest.

# Chapter 2 Olivia

**8 years later**

*It was a rainy day, about three o‚Äôclock in the morning. It was a Friday, so London‚Äôs streets were full of drunk and drugged people who continued partying on the streets or trying to find their homes.*

*However, the situation in the major hospital's emergency department worsened every minute. Most of the patients got there with alcohol poisoning, and some of them overdosed on some drugs. Many people got involved in fights, which caused broken bones or stab wounds. It seemed like the night was never-ending.*

*‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù a doctor pulled the curtain open and stepped to the bed‚Äîa man lay there, his arm full of fresh and dried blood.*

*‚ÄúA deep but clear cut on the forearm, Dr. Flores.‚Äù A nurse responded to the attractive doctor.*

*Dr Olivia Flores was a surgeon in the A&E department. Although she seemed young, her experience and manner of treating people made other doctors and nurses think she had been practising for much longer than she claimed. They weren‚Äôt wrong, but they never questioned her further.*

*Olivia was a fantastic doctor and very attractive as a woman. She had a slender figure but wasn‚Äôt too tall or short. Olivia had natural black hair and eyes like the coldest blue ocean. Her skin was white like she had never seen the Sun, but her full lips were red like blood. She was like a living porcelain doll. Many doctors tried to get close to her, but she refused all of them because she didn‚Äôt want to get involved in a relationship.*

*She didn‚Äôt seek a partner. Even if she was lonely and missed being loved, she couldn‚Äôt let others know what she was. She couldn‚Äôt let any human realise her ice-cold skin, her no-beating heart and her actual age.¬†Olivia must have kept a secret that the feared creatures from horror movies, vampires, existed, and she was one of them.*

*She had a few affairs in her life. She tried to be with other vampires, but their relationships always failed, primarily because of their different eating habits.*

*She tried to move into vampire communities, but again, she couldn‚Äôt bear the barbeque parties, as the vampires called them, where humans were the threats. Olivia would never forget those nights when the group leader brought some innocent humans to the premises. The fear was written on their faces, and to hear them beg for their life and then cry for their mothers damaged her for her long life. He left immediately, and she promised never to try to live again in such a community.*

*But she was a young vampire, only about two hundred years old back then. How old was she now? She couldn‚Äôt tell. She stopped counting it after four hundred years while moving around the world.*

*Especially after experiencing the fear of human beings, Olivia never wanted to hurt people, but she needed blood, of course. There was a period in her life when she lived with other creatures, living the same life as her. She found a small community where she felt good again. In a few years, she became part of a group of scientists trying to know creatures other than humans. They examined the bodies and helped them heal when all the doctors failed, but the community members also had the chance to do experiments. Her target was to find a way to live without blood, but she was unsuccessful. During these years, she only practised bearing her hunger, but she did that very well. She needed a sachet of blood each half year, which she always took from the hospital secretly. That was why it was so beneficial for her to be a doctor in the human world.*

*Because she never looked older, she never spent over ten years in one place. Moving was always a lot of work, but it was necessary, as humans couldn‚Äôt know their existence. Many believed they existed, but they weren‚Äôt allowed to confess that.*

*One of the communities‚Äô leaders could execute vampires who couldn‚Äôt keep the rules.¬†And that was all the vampire‚Äôs biggest fear, including Olivia.*

*‚ÄúI cleaned the wound. A nurse will bandage it for you, Mr. Rest your arm for a few days, keep the bandage dry and clean. My colleagues will inform you when to come back to change it. If it hurts too much, you can take some ibuprofen.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThank you, Dr.‚Äù The human looked at Olivia with gratefulness. Probably, he was involved in a fight, but she didn‚Äôt ask. His wound wasn‚Äôt serious at all, so there was no need to involve the police.*

*She closed the curtain and went to the following folder. Then, she sighed and went to see the next patient.*

*At eight o‚Äôclock in the morning, she sat down in the hospital‚Äôs restaurant. Of course, she bought a coffee, which she never drank, but she needed a break. Not that she was tired physically. She treated twelve lightly injured people, a very ill little girl, and she had three life-saving operations. Even though she was a vampire and stronger than a human, she also loved to sleep. That helped her mind rest, and she hadn‚Äôt slept for three days. She looked around and smiled at the thought that she would miss this place.*

*‚ÄúAre you done?‚Äù Another doctor stepped at her table. She looked up at her and nodded with a smile. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWell, I wish you good luck in the new place. Hopefully, it won‚Äôt be as mad as this one.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThank you, Laura.‚Äù Olivia smiled back. It was her last day here, and she sat at her table with the coffee she would throw away.*

*After she forced herself to stand up, she took her belongings and walked down the hall. At the main reception, everyone said farewell to her and wished her luck with her new job.*

*Even though she had experienced it so many times, she still loved the feeling that people would honestly miss her.*

*She walked out and sat in her car. Then, she turned on the engine and drove back to her apartment.*

*When she stepped inside, the apartment echoed because of the empty rooms and places, just like usual. Even if she was all packed, that changed nothing in the flat. She didn‚Äôt like to buy stuff. Because she moved a lot, she didn‚Äôt want to be attached to anything.*

*She laid down on her inflatable mattress, and she fell asleep quickly.*

*The following day, she showered and got dressed. Then, she had a last look at the place where she had spent the previous ten years. With a sad smile, she stepped out and walked down with her only luggage in her hand. She put the items into her car and drove to her next home, Middlesbrough.*

*It wasn‚Äôt unfamiliar to her. She used to live here a long time ago.*

*She rented out the flat a few weeks ago. She knew where she was going. When she arrived, she looked around, satisfied. This was her home for the next ten years. She hesitated a lot before moving here, as it wasn‚Äôt too far from London, but she wanted to move to the north so much that she only hoped she wouldn‚Äôt meet anyone from her past ten years.*

*She lit some candles and lay in the bath. Even though her body was naturally cold, she enjoyed the warm water. She loved feeling her body warmed up, and it relaxed her.*

*The next day was her first day in the new hospital. It was huge, just like the one in London, but this one looked colder. She had worked here before, but the entire building looked different at that time.*

*‚ÄúMay I help you?‚Äù A young blonde receptionist asked her when she stepped to the desk. Olivia smiled at her.*

*‚ÄúYes. My name is Dr. Olivia Flores. This is my first day here.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù the receptionist looked at her surprised. ‚ÄúI call someone to come. Which department?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúA&E.‚Äù*

*As the woman stood up and walked to another phone, Olivia‚Äôs gaze was fixed on someone. He stood there, and he probably heard everything.*

*When their gazes met, Olivia felt something unfamiliar. She couldn‚Äôt describe that feeling, but her heart probably would have beat crazily if her heart had beat.*

*The man‚Äôs gaze remained serious, and he didn‚Äôt look away. They were staring at each other for a few moments. The man had black hair and an unusually muscular body, and he was a little taller than Olivia. His skin was white, but probably he enjoyed the Sun a lot, and his eyes were brown. She felt like the air froze, and she could only think of what he was and that they would work in one place.*",1,1746877722.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

***Washington Must Secure a Supply of Critical Minerals That China Doesn‚Äôt Control***

[America‚Äôs Most Dangerous Dependence | Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/americas-most-dangerous-dependence)

[Searching for cobalt inside a mine near Salmon, Idaho, May 2024Carlos Barria \/ Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/mq1igtu0txze1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f396ad59f0dd8f2fdb4cb85753b9e34971fddc5b)

  
In the run-up to World War II, the United States had become dangerously overdependent on foreign imports of critical minerals and metals‚Äîeven though officials had warned about the supply chain‚Äôs vulnerabilities for a decade. Congress passed an act creating the National Defense Stockpile in 1939. But when the United States went to war a year later, the scale and urgency of its immediate defense needs still vastly exceeded its domestic mining and production facilities as well as its new stockpile.

President Franklin Roosevelt had to rush to shift control of the stockpile to a newly created agency‚Äîthe Metals Reserve Company, run by civilian industrialists‚Äîthat scoured the globe to buy or barter for whatever it could from wherever it could at whatever cost. To sustain the war economy, government agencies and private industry also expanded U.S. domestic mining and refining operations, engineered synthetic material substitutes, and funded technological advances to improve mines‚Äô efficiency and productivity. Although the United States went on to decisively win the war, the country‚Äôs lack of preparedness led to excess emergency spending as it struggled to outbid the Axis powers for critical materials and costly delays in ramping up the production of tanks, aircraft, and munitions. Washington had to rely on risky and untested foreign sources for minerals and metals and use shipping routes vulnerable to attack.

Today, the United States finds itself in a similar position as it was in the late 1930s. Government officials and independent analysts have long understood that the United States is again dangerously overdependent on foreign adversaries, mainly China, for critical minerals, metals, and rare-earth elements. These resources‚Äîwhich are key inputs in advanced technologies, energy infrastructure, and defense systems‚Äîplay a vital role in the United States‚Äô peacetime economy and national security. Over the past decade, Washington has taken some meaningful steps to address the country‚Äôs supply chain vulnerabilities.

Yet these efforts remain too modest. Should a serious conflict between the United States and China escalate in, for example, the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea, China could plausibly shut off all of its exports of critical materials to the United States and its allies alike. Unlike in 1940, the United States‚Äô current key military adversary is the same country that produces the great majority of the minerals and rare-earth elements necessary to scale up the manufacturing of defense systems and advanced technology‚Äîand controls up to 90 percent of the world‚Äôs processing of these materials.

In the meantime, over the past 15 years, Beijing has shown that it is willing to use its near monopoly over the provision and refinement of strategic resources to punish its adversaries. In 2010, for instance, China cut off its exports of certain rare-earth elements to Japan because of a dispute over what it refers to as the Diaoyu Islands (known in Japan as the Senkaku Islands). China has restricted exports of key critical minerals, rare-earth elements, and proprietary refining technologies to the United States in retaliation against export controls and tariffs levied by the Biden and Trump administrations. Absent an urgent response today to ‚Äúde-risk‚Äù its supply chains, the United States may have no way to adequately address China‚Äôs chokehold tomorrow.

# OWN GOAL

After the Cold War ended, the U.S. Defense Department determined that 99 percent of its national defense stockpile of critical minerals and rare-earth elements‚Äîwhich, at its peak, was worth nearly $42 billion (inflation-adjusted)‚Äîwas surplus. So the Defense Department sold it off, switching to just-in-time global sourcing. Over the next three decades, Washington‚Äôs complacency and Beijing‚Äôs strategic ambition to dominate the full supply chain for critical minerals and rare-earth elements gave China a global mining footprint and a near monopoly in the refinement and processing of those materials. Beijing invested in mines in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and built its own domestic mining, refining, production, and recycling facilities at a lower cost than American companies could manage, especially because they faced fewer environmental and labor-related barriers. China also developed proprietary technologies to improve efficiency and productivity, including cutting-edge end-use products such as batteries, turbines, and weapons.

China‚Äôs subsidized investments drove many market-based competitors into closure or bankruptcy. Today, China‚Äôs giant mining and refining companies operate without much pressure to remain commercially viable, unbound by many constraints on firms funded by private investors and lenders. As a result, Chinese mining companies can flood the market, depressing global commodity prices and further undermining commercial projects.

Recognizing the United States‚Äô vulnerability to a rising and adversarial China, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders to secure greater resilience across mining exploration, extraction, refining, production, and recycling. President Joe Biden subsequently launched a whole-of-government assessment of supply chain resilience during his first 100 days in office and invested yet more government funding into the critical mineral supply chain as new funds became available. Most of this investment utilized Department of Energy grant or loan programs and the 1950 Defense Production Act. That act allows the president to give domestic, Canadian, and (more recently) Australian companies grants, loans and loan guarantees, and purchase commitments to reopen old mines or develop new ones, build new refining and recycling facilities, and support the production of batteries.

>***""Washington‚Äôs complacency helped hand China control over the critical minerals supply chain.""***

These moves by Washington funded the first U.S. producer of battery-grade manganese, the first fully integrated rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, scale-ups in the mining and production of lithium, and the expansion of the graphite supply chain. The Biden administration used government funds to support R & D into extracting materials from nontraditional sources such as mining waste and engineering new substitute materials; it also supported the early-stage commercialization of these new technologies. And Biden launched the Minerals Security Partnership with trusted allies to further secure and co-finance diversified supply chains.

In his second term, Trump has already signed several executive orders creating a more centralized critical minerals strategy under the new National Energy Dominance Council, expediting the permitting of new mining and refining projects, opening federal land to new mining, and expanding industrial-policy investment tools. The first of these executive orders acknowledged that the United States‚Äô ‚Äúnational and economic security are now acutely threatened‚Äù by its ‚Äúreliance upon hostile foreign powers‚Äô mineral production.‚Äù He has also sought to secure overseas deposits of critical materials, targeting the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Greenland, and Ukraine.¬†  
  
But the steps both Biden and Trump took will not be enough. Trump‚Äôs unilateral style is putting the future of Biden‚Äôs Minerals Security Partnership at risk, as partnerships require trust. But trade negotiations with resource-rich allies may secure more opportunities to co-finance mining, refining, and downstream production of magnets and batteries. At the end of the day, there are a limited number of countries with the geological assets to help secure contemporary critical-materials supply chains, and the Trump administration must determine how best to engage with them. Yet the United States must do more than mine and refine. Washington can catch up, but only if it also ramps up stockpiling for both defense and critical civilian needs; employs innovative new financial tools to protect U.S. commercial investments; introduces policies and funding to encourage development of a robust recycling industry for critical minerals and rare-earth elements; and more fully supports research and development.

# FIRST PRINCIPLE

The most immediately achievable task is to strengthen the National Defense Stockpile. As of early 2023, the NDS held just $1.3 billion in assets, including $912 million worth of stockpiled minerals‚Äîbarely enough to meet half of the Pentagon‚Äôs estimated requirements and only a tenth of what is needed for critical civilian infrastructure. The shortfall: $13.5 billion. In the short term, Congress should appropriate at least the full $13.5 billion to close this funding gap, addressing both defense and civilian industrial deficits and prioritizing storing the minerals most vulnerable to Chinese weaponization.

In practice, the stockpile should offer a fixed price floor for a fixed period each month to purchase domestically sourced materials, which would provide U.S. producers more price certainty. After that fixed period, to save U.S. taxpayers‚Äô money, it should have flexibility to source and purchase at the lowest available price on the global market, taking advantage of Chinese dumping and global commodity price gluts. Washington‚Äôs medium-term aim should be to restore the NDS to its Cold War scale until its supply chains become less vulnerable.

# ""Congress must close the National Defense Stockpile‚Äôs funding gap.""

Expanding the functions of the NDS is a first step to protect against Chinese nonmarket practices. But large, state-subsidized Chinese companies not only dominate the supply of critical minerals and rare-earth elements. They control their pricing, and compared with other commodities such as crude oil, the prices for many critical minerals and most rare-earth elements are illiquid and opaque. Unless private exchanges begin to offer adequate price clarity and reasonable hedging tools, the United States must deploy new financial tools so that market-based mining and refining companies can hedge against Chinese dumping and price illiquidity*.*¬†The U.S. government already uses the Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Commodity Credit Corporation to play a similar function in 22 agricultural commodity markets, protecting American farmers from the consequences of price volatility when prices fall below a guaranteed level.  
  
In 2024*,*¬†two Democratic and two Republican senators proposed the Critical Materials Future Act¬†to support domestic critical material processing. If passed, the legislation would empower the Department of Energy to start pilot programs to provide price floors, advanced market commitments, or forward contracts to eligible projects that refine, process, or recycle raw critical materials into purified forms suitable for first-use applications. With that increased price certainty, companies could plan better and more easily secure debt and equity financing. The bill would also create a Critical Materials Revolving Fund at the Treasury Department that reinvests proceeds from recovered prices into new projects.

But if Congress cannot pass such legislation, it still has options. It could authorize the Strategic Materials Division at the Defense Department‚Äôs Defense Logistics Agency, which currently manages the NDS, to deploy these same tools under guidance from the Energy and Treasury Departments. Ramping up the financial capacities of the agency already responsible for the purchase, sale, storage, and management of critical minerals and rare-earth elements could better align the NDS‚Äôs management with a broader industrial policy. Other government institutions could also be afforded expanded mandates and new financial instruments. These should support the domestic development of critical materials supply chains and protect market-based businesses through equity purchases, loans or loan guarantees, or other credit instruments that counter Chinese competition. Trump‚Äôs first executive order on U.S. mineral production envisions expanding the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation‚Äôs authority to fund domestic critical mineral projects. Because the DFC is set for reauthorization later this year, Congress is already contemplating broadening its scope, size, and available financial tools.

# TRASH TO TREASURE

Shoring up the United States‚Äô access to raw materials is only one part of the puzzle. Regardless of their origin, most critical minerals and nearly all rare-earth elements are sent to China for refining and processing. This chokepoint is the Achilles‚Äô heel of the entire supply chain. The Trump administration should prioritize expanding U.S. refining capacity over supporting new mining. But because refineries are water-intensive, can pose environmental hazards, and are often located near indigenous lands, permitting new refineries would remain difficult and time-consuming, even if contemplated reforms are implemented.

Recycling offers a partial but powerful solution that should feature more in Trump‚Äôs proposals. Unlike fossil fuels, many critical minerals and rare-earth elements can be recovered from used electronics, batteries, and even weapons systems. Although current recycling methods cannot generate enough strategic materials to replace those produced by new mines and processing facilities, recycling can create a key secondary source. In 2022, for instance, the Defense Logistics Agency launched a program to recover germanium‚Äîan element needed for high-tech, military, and energy-related applications‚Äîfrom retired weapons systems and night-vision equipment. Two years later, this effort helped fill a dangerous gap when China banned germanium exports to the United States. In the coming years, the DLA recycling program is expected to yield ten percent of the U.S. defense industry‚Äôs germanium needs.

But the United States‚Äô capacity to recycle strategic resources continues to lag behind China‚Äôs. For example, Beijing mandates that battery producers take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products, including recycling. The European Union has also implemented a recycling mandate for battery producers. Washington should follow suit and more intentionally incorporate recycling into its resilience strategy. The Defense Department could be required to recycle more military waste products that could yield critical minerals, metals, and rare-earth elements. The Department of Energy has recommended that the government adopt end-of-life recycling requirements for batteries similar to those imposed by China and the EU, but for this to happen, Washington must better support the development of private-sector recycling infrastructure that can help reduce costs.

# CRITICAL THINKING

Ultimately, the United States needs to invest more in the kind of technological innovation in which it has already excelled. U.S. companies have extracted lithium from brine deposits in Chile for decades, but more recently, government-funded innovation has supported extraction from geothermal brine in California. Newer technologies are enabling commercially viable lithium extraction from oil and gas fracking wastewater, unlocking an enormous and previously overlooked domestic resource. Companies are actively exploring methods to recover rare-earth elements from coal and coal byproducts, too, turning environmental liabilities into strategic opportunities. Government labs and universities are spinning out startups working on revolutionary processes for recovering and extracting critical materials.

In fact, advances in battery chemistry could eventually reduce the United States‚Äô need for certain minerals altogether. Newer lithium iron phosphate batteries, for example, require less cobalt than older designs; sodium-ion batteries could further diminish the need for lithium and nickel. Materials engineering breakthroughs enabled by AI may identify new compounds or substitutes for traditional inputs that may upend today‚Äôs assumptions about what resources are critical at all.  
  
But the innovations that could transform U.S. supply chains require much more capital and policy support, including more government funding for labs and universities studying materials engineering, grants for demonstration projects, support for startups on their way to commercial viability, and policy signals that Washington is ready to pursue a comprehensive resilience strategy. There is broad bipartisan agreement that the United States must secure its access to critical minerals and rare-earth elements. There is no time for incremental improvements. The United States‚Äô intensifying rivalry with China, growing instability in the Indo-Pacific, and the trend toward economic decoupling all mean that Washington must take urgent action. As in 1940, the moment calls for both speed and ambition. A national critical minerals strategy that expands U.S. stockpiles, creates new financial tools to support domestic mining and refining, deploys rapid support for recycling, and supports new technologies can once again ensure that America‚Äôs industrial base is ready for any challenge.

Interior Ministry doesn't care.","Basically title. Extremely tired with pneumocephalus laying in bed and was 98% sure I was going to die yesterday.

Father is former Serbian citizen, when I applied for a work permit in Austria it was delayed for like a year forcing me to rely on him in his apartment after which he said he'll kick me out if I don't go to a language course whilst I was preparing for brain surgery.

Then he stopped sending money for food and I had to have my aunt bring me food, so I started telling the interior ministry I'll go on a hunger strike after which the work permit was finally processed.

My father forced me to go to a Serbian social centre and give a statement with his attorney a few years ago that he'll support me in Vienna, so they gave him citizenship release even though the Serbian Family Law and court judgement are lex specialis derogat legi generali, so I reported this to Serbia's supreme prosecution which opened a corruption probe.

I'm also pretty sure he bribed police in Serbia and has had acts like abuse, strangulation and threats with mafia reduced to 2 euro coffee misdemeanor fines, resulting in a clear record when applying for Austrian citizenship.

He also voided Vienna's MA35 authority and went to a friend in a foreign Austrian state to get citizenship more easily. Austria's corruption watchdog also opened a probe for this.

The locks are changed and I'm in the hospital for about 17 days now. He's on vacation in Slovenia.

Firstly, I‚Äôve officially left Canberra as of several weeks ago, but I wanted to take this opportunity to shout out the pros and cons of living in Australia‚Äôs capital city.

First one ‚Äî the reversing of parking. 
I don‚Äôt know how many times I had to wait in Civic for someone to spend 15 minutes trying to reverse their vehicle in. 
Guys, it‚Äôs not that hard. 
It‚Äôs really not hard to just drive in forwards. 
Don‚Äôt worry about the reversing. 

Also, on a side note, I did tell someone at the pub about that today, and they‚Äôre going to spread it like wildfire around Port Macquarie, so we‚Äôre going to get this thing going, and we‚Äôre going to teach Canberrans to make driving in great again.

Second point ‚Äî food scene. 
Look, I had some great meals at Inka, Raku, etc - I had some great coffees at Good Neighbour. I had a great sandwich at Al‚Äôs Diner. 

But the Kingston Hotel really needs to up their game with the chips. 
I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with the smoky aioli, but the chips are always cold, and it‚Äôs such a shame because the Kingston does great food. 
But the chips. 
Guys, the chips.

Number three ‚Äî the weather. 

You know, as a Brisbane girl, I thought I‚Äôd be royally fucked coming to Canberra, and that was true. 
I mean, I left 26 degrees to come down to minus 10. 
And did it break me? 
Yeah, it broke me. 
But it broke me in a way that‚Äôs given me the confidence to rebuild my life piece by piece.

Four ‚Äî why is there another Mecca opening in Civic? 
Why don‚Äôt we have some more indie, independent retailers? 

Love Mecca, but I think four shops in Civic seems a little bit of an overkill when the average foot traffic along that intersection is about five people an hour.

That‚Äôs about it. 
I never got to visit the War Memorial, which was sad, but I did get to go to Parliament House once. 

Very sad that I missed being there during the election, but really, I wouldn‚Äôt have spoken to anyone because Canberra seems to not like to talk to people. 
So maybe just work on the social skills.

Come visit Brisbane when you need some sunshine, but you know what? 

Canberra summers are where it‚Äôs at. No humidity ‚Äî so pros, pros, pros.

Great food scene. 

Some people were a bit odd, but you know what? I was going through it too, so I‚Äôm not entirely blaming you. 
I‚Äôm just giving you some opportunity for growth.

All the best. 
Thanks for the memories, as they say ‚Äî and please, please stop reversing your car in.

I started working my regular job plus weekends at a coffee shop. I've also been hitting the gym at least 4 times a week. Turns out when you have an actual goal discipline follows.  
My room used to be a fucking mess but now I keep it clean because I don't like how it looks. In the past I never cared about how it looked. Parents are kinda sad I'm leaving but also proud. I love em but I want to start my own life.

I never knew how much of a positive impact would this have in my mental health. So my tip here would be to start putting out goals and what to do with your life because that has helped me a lot!",11,1746876634.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Hello. I have a Baratza Sette 270 grinder and A Gaggia Classic Pro (with PID, OPV and a dimmer mod).

Soon after I bought it, I had to install a shim to be able to grind fine enough. I feel that after I installed the dimmer recently I can't grind fine enough with that grinder. With some coffees I grind at 1 and it still goes out too fast. If I remember correctly there is a second shim in the box that I can install, but I also consider upgrading with something better.

To be honest I've been out of the loop on what is out there in the marker, so I am looking for suggestions. 

Here are some things I look for:
* noise - the Baratza is very loud. So loud that I often consider not making a coffee if someone is still sleeping in the house
* size - I don't have a lot of space, so it should be as compact as possible
* single dose - I've never used the hopper of the Baratza to store my coffee. I always single dose
* color options - I don't want anything white, inox or glossy

I hope someone can help me with suggestions

1kj7xhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kj7xhh/i_had_the_worst_birthday_because_of_my_husband/,I had the worst birthday because of my husband..,"It is 6:30 in the morning, one day after my birthday. I spent last night crying on the sofa until I eventually fell asleep and am tearing up as I type this. I promise I will try to make this as brief as possible.

My husband (m32; I'm going to call him Charlie) and I (f,28) have been together for eight and a half years, have two beautiful daughters, and have had some rocky years, but we have always loved and loved hard every day. Mine and Charlie's birthdays are about one week apart, his being first. Last week, I worked hard to pull out all the stops and actively planned on his special day for two months to make sure everything was perfect. I worked all day to make him a huge steak dinner with half a dozen of his favorite fixin's, I baked and frosted homemade birthday cake that had a hand drawn Baltimore Orioles logo (I practiced drawing it for a week), custom mixed colors, and the best shell borders that I could pipe out, and I heavily decorated our home with balloons and streamers to match his apparent Orioles theme. Our kids were absolutely thrilled and excited to have a celebration, and Charlie thanked me what felt like a million times - hugs and kisses all around. On top of all that, I was able to surprise him with his birthday gift: two Orioles tickets in an amazing section and an overnight stay in a private suite at the Ivy in Baltimore. He and his brother will be leaving for Camden Yards later this week - I am in no way a baseball fan, and someone would have to be at home with the kids, anyway.
Fast forward to yesterday, Charlie had a short day of work, gave me a peck on my cheek on his way out the door, and briefly wished me a happy birthday. It was still dark outside when he left and our girls were still sleeping. The day went by as any other day: the girls were fed breakfast, cleaned, dressed, brushed, and sent to school, I managed to grab a free Starbucks coffee with my birthday reward, and I went home to work on an oil painting I haven't put down in the last month. Somewhere within the events I just listed, Charlie gave me a call and very plainly said that he would be home late because his brother needed help cutting his grass. I would not normally have an issue with Charlie helping anyone, but it was raining off and on all day, and also... it was my birthday. At first I thought he was joking with me because there was absolutely no way his brother would allow him to step out on my birthday (his brother, James, 29, and I have been very good friends for many years), but when I made that point to him, he rudely snapped at me saying that he volunteered to do the job. I'm not sure if it was the snappy tone or the words that were said, but my heart broke and I started to tear up. 
This birthday was already going to be emotional because it was going to be spent without my family for the first time ever as they all are on a vacation out of the country visiting my great great grandmother for Mother's Day. Looking back, I wish I could have gone, too, but it was a bit out of budget. To make matters worse, that was the last time my husband spoke more than ten words to me throughout the remainder of the day. I was devastated to say the least. I have never known Charlie to be like this with anyone, let alone his wife and mother of his children. 
All of yesterday was spent in tears, unable to do anything outside of grabbing a coffee due to bus drop off times. No dinner (like, at all, I'm not being dramatic), no cake, no card/gift, no nothing. I feel like I don't matter to him. He has made no effort to speak to me and I have asked him if we could talk about it. I don't know what happened to my husband. I am still crying on this damned couch... ",25,1746875980.0,TrueOffMyChest,21,0.93,False

Most people hate being on camera. Maybe it‚Äôs the lighting. Maybe it's the whole ‚Äúseeing yourself speak‚Äù thing. Either way, it makes content creation a pain.

And don‚Äôt even start on hiring voice actors or motion designers. It‚Äôs expensive, slow, and often feels like too much hassle for a simple task.

But what if you could **generate a talking avatar from a photo**, feed it a script, and in under a minute, produce a sharp, expressive video without blinking twice?

That‚Äôs where [HeyGen Avatar IV](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/heygen-official) takes it to the next level. It's for the camera-shy, time-starved, or just plain introverted folks who still want to show up in their content ‚Äî sort of.

Let‚Äôs see what it can really do.

# üì¶ Product Overview

* **Product Name**: HeyGen Avatar IV
* **Category**: AI Video Tools ‚ûù Avatar Generators
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.9/5

# üß† What Is HeyGen Avatar IV?

HeyGen Avatar IV helps you **create lifelike avatars from pictures** and turn them into full video presenters in just a few clicks. No studio. No awkward rehearsals.

It takes your photo, combines it with audio or text, and uses AI to produce expressive facial movements. It‚Äôs like having a digital twin ‚Äî minus the emotional baggage.

Unlike many **AI avatar tools** that feel stiff or off-sync, this one leans heavily on timing and tone. The result is more fluid, more human, and frankly, more usable.

If you‚Äôre ready to **make a video with AI using your face**, this is a solid way to do it without breaking the bank ‚Äî or your spirit.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

You start by uploading a clear image. That‚Äôs all you need to **generate an avatar from an image** that looks and moves convincingly.

Next, you either type in a script or upload a voice file. This input lets the AI **convert a photo to a talking video**, complete with synced lips and blinks.

If you're curious about speed, don't worry. It takes under 2 minutes to **turn a photo into video using AI**, which is faster than most people can find the record button.

# üßë‚Äçüíº Who Is It Best For?

This tool works great for marketers, solopreneurs, and teams that produce a lot of video. It‚Äôs especially useful for those needing **talking AI avatars for business**.

It‚Äôs also helpful for creators who want to **use an AI avatar that talks like them** without standing in front of a camera. You stay offscreen but still sound like you.

Educators, internal comms folks, and trainers will also find value. You can **create videos using AI avatars** for multiple languages in minutes.

Oh, and it‚Äôs pretty good for introverts who‚Äôve considered faking a voiceover just to avoid the horror of watching themselves speak.

# üöÄ Key Features & Benefits

HeyGen supports over 120 avatar styles, or you can just **create a talking avatar from a photo** of yourself and be done with it.

There‚Äôs support for over 175 languages, thanks to the built-in **AI avatar maker with voice clone**. Just pick a voice or upload your own ‚Äî it handles both well.

You don‚Äôt need to install anything. The entire platform is online, making it easy to **use this image / text**  **to AI video generator from** anywhere.

Plenty of other platforms claim to provide the **best AI avatar generator for videos** ‚Äî this one actually feels like it belongs in that conversation.

It's a genuine, high-end **AI video avatar software** for folks who want something quick and polished. Great for demos, updates, or social media drops.

Even if you just want a **photo to video AI avatar tool** to play with, it‚Äôs a pretty entertaining one.

# üß™ Carol's Personal Experience

My friend Carol ‚Äî a freelance course designer I met at a digital marketing meetup in Melbourne ‚Äî recently tried [HeyGen Avatar IV](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/heygen-official) after I mentioned it over coffee.

She‚Äôs constantly churning out onboarding modules and explainer videos but hates recording herself. Like, truly loathes it.

She used the platform to **generate a talking avatar from a photo** for a client intro video. No green screen, no awkward rehearsals ‚Äî just a headshot she took on her balcony and a script she‚Äôd already written.

The avatar blinked, paused, and even tilted its head slightly, like it was really thinking between lines.

Her favorite part? The voice clone. She uploaded a sample of her own audio, and HeyGen nailed her intonation. It was surreal hearing her speak through a digital version of herself ‚Äî more expressive than she expected, with no weird uncanny valley moments.

She did mention one hiccup: the avatar‚Äôs mouth movement lagged ever so slightly on a longer clip. It wasn‚Äôt awful, but it was just enough to make her redo that take.

Still, as Lena put it, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs miles ahead of anything I‚Äôve used before, and faster than waiting on edits from a video guy.‚Äù

For someone juggling multiple projects, HeyGen gave her a way to **make a video using AI and anyone's face** that felt polished ‚Äî without spending her whole weekend doing retakes.

# üßç Output Quality & Realism

This tool delivers **lifelike AI video creation** that doesn‚Äôt feel stiff or plasticky. The avatars actually breathe, blink, and pause like real people.

If you're chasing authenticity without hiring a human, this is as close as you‚Äôll get for now. It beats anything you‚Äôd expect from a budget solution.

A **realistic avatar creator using AI** used to be wishful thinking ‚Äî now it‚Äôs just a browser tab away.

# ‚úÖ Pros

üü¢ **Lets you create expressive avatars using only a single photo**  
üü¢ **Supports voice cloning and over 175 languages and accents**  
üü¢ **Fast, clean UI with quick turnaround time**  
üü¢ **Ideal for content creators and businesses needing fast videos**

# ‚ùå Cons

üî¥ **Video length is capped at 30 seconds for Avatar IV**  
üî¥ **No editing once the video is generated**  
üî¥ **Some avatars don‚Äôt reflect nuanced emotions as well**

# üõí Where To Buy HeyGen Avatar IV

You should always [get HeyGen Avatar IV from the official website](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/heygen-official). Period.

Scammy third-party sellers might promise ""lifetime access"" for $9, but they often deliver junk ‚Äî or worse, malware.

# üßæ Conclusion

I have 3 visitors coming later this month to Dubai from our European offices for a few days. They have about 5 hours free during PM time on one of the weekdays, so I was keen for them to at least get a glimpse of the old Dubai.

I was planning to drive them in my car from Media City to the Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood around 4 PM on one of the weekdays before rush hour traffic kicks in on SZR.

As I understand, the Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood closes around 8 PM, so we have to get moving right away.

Since I saw online that the Coin Museum closes by 3 PM, we will miss it. So I was thinking that as soon as we arrive and Park in Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood basement parking around 4:45 PM, we will walk around the wall of old Dubai (Google maps says it is temporarily closed!), Camels (if they still have them there), the Coffee Museum (see online that they close by 5 PM), and Al Fahidi historical district and neighbourhood areas (see online that they close by 8 PM).

By 6:30 PM/7 PM, I would like to take them to Spice & Gold Souk via the traditional Abra. Would this be possible to take the Abra from the Al Fahidi Marine Transport Station itself, or would we need to walk all the way to Bur Dubai and take the Abra from there?

We then hope to take the Abra back to Al Fahidi around 9 PM, have dinner together at the Al Khayma Heritage Restaurant in Al Fahidi, and then drop them at their hotel.

Hard to see online which touristy places around Al Fahidi are now open/closed/being renovated. Let me know if this is practical/if you have recently tried to do something similar/have better suggestions to do during these 5 hours.

I was a single mom of two, and very anxious about dating to begin with. Their father is about as useful as a fly, only seeing them every other weekend and never following parenting rules/safety guidelines which in turn makes my life harder.

Anyway : so I met my boyfriend and we were inseparable, he was very kind and respectful and just honestly the man of my dreams in every way possible up until he wasn‚Äôt. I lived alone, with my kids and my dog in my OWN HOUSE in a nice development that was equally 20 minutes away from my grandparents who are very involved in my kids lives (to which I‚Äôm so grateful for because they‚Äôre all I really have).

My boyfriend lived over an hour away, and by 6 months had chosen to move into my house. He was then driving close to 3 hours a day to work, and back and had school twice a week to which he would come home late. I understood it was a lot for him, and so I made up in anyway I could.

I packed his lunches, prepped his coffee, did his laundry, I did all the shopping, I mean everything. He had to do nothing aside of mow my small lawn maybe once a week in the summer or ‚Äúfix stuff‚Äù so my grandpa didn‚Äôt have to.

Fast forward - by September/Nov. we were looking for a house closer to work for him, and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to move too far because of emergencies. Well, we end up falling in love with a nice wooded almost 4 acre property, with a shop for him of course - an hour and 10 minutes from my family. We settled on the house, and ever since then he has been a literal fucking nightmare.

Treating me like shit, constantly snapping on me and the kids, never wanting to actually be around me, the list could go on and on and on. Now granted, he‚Äôs the one who ‚Äúwanted a property with acreage and didn‚Äôt want neighbors‚Äù and he finally got that, but now does nothing but complain about all of the work it takes.

The property has a beautiful pond, and I‚Äôve always wanted Koi. I have no friends around here, no family no nothing. He wanted to fill the entire pond in with dirt, I didn‚Äôt. He helped me restore it, and he‚Äôs helping me catch fish to remove because it‚Äôs overcrowded. Well. That came with a big price, and I wasn‚Äôt aware of that either. It just seems like anything I do want to do or enjoy he has to have a problem with, or he‚Äôs ‚Äúconstantly trying to prove a point or teach me a lesson‚Äù.

I take care of my two girls, I got a puppy for us because he hated my dog, like I do all the cooking, cleaning, caring for my kids, grocery shopping, prepping, laundry, etc etc etc. but if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp out‚Äù enough with the OUTSIDE WORK - I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpulling my weight‚Äù. It‚Äôs like the dude wants me to do everything and THEN SOME and suffer in the meantime. I mean did he think he was just gonna have to work, come home and sleep and do nothing aside of that? With a property like this??

It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day weekend, and he saw me busting my ass all day yesterday trying to catch up on cleaning the girls room, cleaning the house, making dinner, cleaning up, laundry, shower and bedtime with my kids, vacuuming the rest of the first floor‚Ä¶ he left a bucket of fish on the patio and told me to ‚Äúgo dump it‚Äù while I was busy doing everything and I forgot about it because of the other SHIT I WAS DOING.

He comes in here at 3:30 in the morning, wakes me up RUDELY to tell me ‚ÄúI have a lot to clean up tomorrow - the animals outside got fish guts  all over the place‚Äù because I forgot about the bucket‚Ä¶ he knows I don‚Äôt sleep well, he knows I get anxious and upset easy, and here I am two hours later and can‚Äôt sleep. I said ‚Äúdude you could have just gotten it for me you saw all the shit I was doing and I forgot‚Äù. He said ‚Äúyou expected me to do that for you‚Äù and I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just doing something nice for somebody when you see they‚Äôre busy doing everything else dude‚Äù.

I‚Äôm constantly doing things without even thinking twice and I‚Äôd give you the shirt off my back, my grandparents raised me that way. Maybe that‚Äôs the problem, I expect men to men like the old days and I just don‚Äôt think they exist anymore. He was sitting on his ass on the couch while I was doing all of the above mind you.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, so I guess my main question for all the men on here is : Why would you uproot your girlfriend and her two kids over an hour from everybody and everything she‚Äôs ever known and promise things would get easier when you‚Äôre not tired from driving 3 hours a day and then turn into a monster the week you move into the new house?",1,1746875559.0,relationshipproblems,0,1.0,False
1kj7t5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1kj7t5s/does_the_omron_small_blood_pressure_monitor_cuff/,Does the Omron Small Blood Pressure Monitor Cuff Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review,"The Omron 9515373-3 Small Blood Pressure Monitor Cuff has been part of my daily routine for a few weeks now. As someone who keeps an active eye on health, I decided it was time to test out this compact cuff designed for smaller arm circumferences (17-22 cm). It's marketed as being compatible with a range of Omron devices and promises precision in tracking blood pressure. While the product stands out in some areas, there are also considerations you‚Äôll want to weigh.

**Compact Design and Comfort**  
The first thing I noticed about the cuff was how lightweight it is‚Äîjust 3.53 ounces. Its slim profile (5.55‚ÄùL x 4.84‚ÄùW x 3.35‚ÄùTh) makes it easy to store, even in my overly crowded drawer of medical gear. Wearing it is surprisingly comfortable too. The material doesn‚Äôt irritate my arm even on warm days, something I didn‚Äôt expect at this price point. However, keep in mind this cuff is strictly for smaller arms. My partner, whose arms measure over 22 cm, found it impossible to use, which was a bummer when we tried to share the device during a family blood pressure check. 

**Compatibility with Omron Devices**  
This cuff plays nicely with a variety of Omron monitors including the HEM-7120, 7121, and more. Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre using newer Omron models with the Comfort Cuff (e.g., M6 Comfort, M7, or M10-IT), this product isn‚Äôt compatible. That‚Äôs clearly stated in the description, but it‚Äôs definitely something to double-check before making a purchase. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that this packet only contains the cuff‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt come bundled with a monitor, so be prepared to supply your own compatible device.

**[Check Omron 9515373-3 price on Amazon.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b0021zjvkm/)**

**Advantages**  
After using this cuff extensively, I‚Äôve come to appreciate its thoughtful design and user-friendly setup. It‚Äôs refreshing to find a product that just works without needing a complicated manual.  

- Lightweight; perfect for travel or clutter-free storage.  
- Comfortable fit for smaller arms, with no abrasion or soreness.  
- Seamless compatibility with popular Omron models.  
- Simple and straightforward to attach and detach.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Though packed with positives, there are areas where the product left something to be desired. Whether it‚Äôs compatibility constraints or usability quirks, these factors might affect some users more than others.  

- Not versatile‚Äîfits only small arm circumferences (17-22 cm).  
- Limited compatibility with certain Omron monitors like Comfort Cuff models.  
- No included monitor; something beginners might overlook.  

**Ease of Use and Set-Up**  
Attaching this cuff is a breeze. The Velcro strap offers a snug yet not too tight fit, which is vital for accurate readings. I used it frequently in the mornings while preparing my first cup of coffee‚Äîquite the multitasking feat! On days when I felt sluggish, even my pre-teen niece managed to help me attach the cuff properly, thanks to its intuitive design. There‚Äôs no extra learning curve, making it suitable for people across different age groups.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Accuracy is the holy grail of any blood pressure monitor cuff. I tested this with my Omron HEM-7130, and to my delight, readings were consistent with those from clinical-grade devices. However, I noticed something odd‚Äîthe readings fluctuated slightly when the cuff wasn‚Äôt perfectly positioned. Accurate placement is key, and even a minor misalignment can impact the numbers. If you‚Äôre new to home blood pressure monitoring, this might require a little practice.

**Competing Products**  
In the world of small blood pressure monitor cuffs, this product faces stiff competition. One alternative I‚Äôve personally used is a generic small cuff that came with its own monitor. While that setup covered all bases without compatibility concerns, the material felt much less comfortable over extended use. Then there‚Äôs the popular Omron Comfort Cuff, which is bulkier but far more inclusive in terms of arm size.  

- The smaller fitting range of this cuff makes it less versatile than competitors.  
- Comfort-wise, the material here feels superior to some mid-range alternatives.  
- Precision matches high-end rivals but with fewer frills or multifunctionality.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its price range, the small blood pressure monitor cuff offers excellent value. There‚Äôs a clear focus on quality and simplicity, which means you aren‚Äôt paying for unnecessary bells and whistles. While some competing models include bundled monitors (which can be appealing to first-timers), I found the lack of extras here didn‚Äôt bother me, given that it serves its purpose straightforwardly. Whether or not it‚Äôs the right buy depends heavily on having a compatible device at home.

It's a Comfort Addiction.,"I don‚Äôt know about everyone ‚Äî I can only speak for myself. When I first started promoting my workbook on unbreakable discipline, I kept thinking: *‚ÄúI need motivation to get this going.‚Äù* And maybe that‚Äôs where most people start too. But here‚Äôs the truth:  
If you want discipline, you have to **forget motivation**.  
Motivation is like sugar ‚Äî sweet at first, gives you a rush, but eventually, it crashes you. You start asking:  
*‚ÄúWhy am I even doing this?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúDo I really need this?‚Äù*

That‚Äôs not laziness. That‚Äôs addiction ‚Äî addiction to your **comfort zone**. And your comfort zone is the **enemy** of discipline, personal growth, and productivity. You‚Äôre not lazy. You just want an easier path to get disciplined. But here‚Äôs the hard truth: **Discipline starts with discomfort.** Let me tell you about myself.  
I created a workbook ‚Äî not just some digital product, but a real tool that focuses on building:

* Discipline
* Mental toughness
* Emotional control
* Real productivity

At first, I thought, *‚ÄúI‚Äôll just DM people struggling with discipline ‚Äî they‚Äôll get it.‚Äù* Then I told myself, *‚ÄúI‚Äôll start tomorrow.‚Äù* But I forgot something important: **I need to follow my own workbook before expecting others to.** It‚Äôs been 11 days. No sales yet. Maybe I‚Äôll fail. Maybe people want change ‚Äî but they don‚Äôt have the courage to face discomfort. Still, I choose discomfort over laziness. Even if I‚Äôm criticized, ignored, banned, or fail completely ‚Äî I‚Äôll keep going. I know deep down, a lot of people want to build discipline, get mentally tougher, and take control of their emotions. But most are still caught by laziness and comfort. This workbook helped me escape that trap ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not here to sell it to you. I‚Äôm just telling you the truth.

If you‚Äôre ready to stop chasing motivation and start building discipline, the link is in my profile.  
It costs less than a cup of coffee. If you're just looking for motivation?  
Then walk away ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt for you. This is for the few who are done with excuses",7,1746875178.0,getdisciplined,3,0.77,False

- Day 2-3: generally more moody. Easier to cry, more irritable. But still thought ""hey im not having any withdrawal - maybe ill go off completely tomorrow"" [im glad i didnt]

\**Dear Reader,*

***Before you read this story, please note that it contains some adult scenes that could be disturbing. (18+)***

*The night was still young on a Friday in the Blue Moon Pack. Some werewolves were still drinking at the usual weekend party, and some were tired enough to sleep early, ready for the Saturday night party. The Omegas still worked hard, except for those forced into a bedroom by more muscular werewolves.*

*The posh side of the pack house should have always kept quiet to avoid disturbing the upper class. However, one bedroom was vivacious. The mating smell filled the warm room, along with the moans that neither Beta Lucy nor Gamma Vincent held back.*

*The sweat shone in the dim light on Vincent‚Äôs back while his muscular body forced Lucy‚Äôs slender figure under him, thrusting in her hard and fast. Lucy dug her nails uncontrollably into the skin on his back, leaving long, red marks on it.*

*Usually, it would have disturbed him, but this time, it made him proud to give so much pleasure to the beautiful Beta. Her long blond hair, brown eyes and perfect shape attracted most of the werewolves in the pack, but only a few of them were brave enough to touch her or go close to her, even if she was flirting with them. Of course, they had a good reason for keeping their distance from her.*

*Lucy had reached her climax twice already, and even if Vincent started to feel exhausted, he wanted to give her more to prove that he was worth being in her bed.¬†Like many werewolves in the pack, he knew Lucy's seductive behaviour, making so many wolves fall for her and end up in her bed. Therefore, he wanted to be the one who she would prefer to have sex with when she was in need.*

*He watched Lucy‚Äôs naturally sizeable breasts bouncing up and down. This view kept him so attracted that he couldn't help but lean closer many times to please her nipples with his mouth and tongue.*

*Each time he held a nipple between his teeth, gently pulling on it, Lucy's body trembled a little, and he could feel how her wetness was bathing his stiff shaft. At the same time, he pounded her even more intensively, hoping he would keep himself back from orgasming too soon. He moved from nipple to nipple, hearing Lucy's pleasure, which attracted him so much that he decided he wanted to finish between her round breasts, watching his seeds moisturize her soft skin.*

""Faster! I am coming!"" Lucy moaned, giving him an order that he must obey.

*Their moans were even louder, just like the sound of their bodies met with each thrust, when finally he saw her eyes rolling back and her gorgeous body tensed under him. Her moisture was all over his lower abdomen, and he couldn‚Äôt be more proud of himself for giving his Beta so much pleasure.*

*Hoping that he satisfied the Beta for tonight, he pulled out between her warm and wet inner walls, and he moved above her chest, putting his palms against the headboard of the bed.*

*Lucy knew what he wanted, and she was in the game, feeling grateful after her three orgasms. He moved his shaft between her breasts. Lucy pushed the big boobs together, massaging the stiff shaft that was wet from her juices, letting him get his reward. What's more, as she enjoyed being with him so much, she lifted her head to reach the head of his cck with her tongue when it appeared with each thrust, which made him moan louder. However, soon, his moans turned into gasping, and he shot his seeds between the perfect breasts with an audible groan. He was enjoying feeling his warm liquid mixing with the gorgeous Beta's wetness between the soft skin. He felt so empty like never before, and he hoped he could satisfy his Beta enough so she would give her other chances to prove his abilities.*

*Lucy was smiling as she knew what the Gamma were thinking of. Usually, the werewolves who satisfied him had the same look in their eyes, delighted, hoping to give them another chance to have sex with her. The three orgasms surprised her as well, so she thought she would let Vincent visit her often.*

*However, soon, her smile disappeared. She started frowning as a familiar scent, more potent than their arousal‚Äôs scent, hit her nose. Lucy was thinking for a moment. What got in her mind was impossible. She planned everything well, just like usual. That must have been her imagination, so she tried to calm herself. But the scent became more substantial, and her heart started pounding faster when she noticed Vincent's frown, as he could smell the fragrance. Her eyes widened in fear when she desperately tried to push him off of her, but it was too late.*

*The door swung open, and the loud, furious growl made Vincent jump off her, meeting his worst nightmare.¬†At that moment, he regretted falling for Lucy and being so weak; the beautiful she-wolf made him believe he could do such a thing without consequences.*

*The Alpha stood there himself. The one who had all the right to kill him for stealing someone belonged to him. He couldn‚Äôt say a word. His mind went blank as he heard Lucy‚Äôs yelling while hitting him, blaming him for raping her. Yes, the gorgeous she-wolf, who he had just satisfied three times in a row, now acted like he was the bad guy and she was a victim only.*

*But Lucy‚Äôs sudden turn couldn‚Äôt bother him then, as the Alpha, Lucy‚Äôs mate, walked over to him. First, he felt his powerful grip around his neck. Then he felt the bedside table‚Äôs corner hit his head badly. His blood leaked on the carpet, but he didn‚Äôt have time to do anything, as the Alpha punched him numerous times in the head. If the Alpha stopped for only a second, he would crawl on the floor, kiss his shoes, and beg for forgiveness, but that was too late. The pain he felt was unbearable, and he deserved it.*

*His open wounds made the Alpha‚Äôs fist bloody, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care about it, just like he didn‚Äôt care about the sound of his bone fractures either.*

*The Alpha gone mad. Seeing his beloved mate under someone else made him lose his mind. There was no longer a human side of him. He let his wolf control their body. The Gamma, compared to its Alpha, was weak. Vincent couldn‚Äôt do anything against him.*

*Vincent became unconscious, lying lifelessly on the floor in his blood, but the Alpha still couldn't stop hitting him.*

*The old Alpha and Beta, Lucy‚Äôs father, appeared in the room, and they held the young Alpha. He wanted to brake free of their grip, and finish what he started, but finally the two elder werewolves won. They held the Alpha back from killing the half-dead Gamma.*

*Lucy covered herself using a sheet and sobbed in a corner.¬†She tried to show her weakest side, acting like a fragile, hurt she wolf.*

*When the two elders successfully stopped the young Alpha, she stood up, still sobbing, and walked to his mate, trying to hug him.*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. This male Gamma was much stronger than me. I couldn‚Äôt help it."" she cried. ""I shouted, but no one heard me. Alpha, I feel so ashamed. I know it is hard for you as well, but please forgive me.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúForgive you? Never!‚Äù He shouted while gasping for air. He didn't realize that, but the Gamma's blood was all over on his clothes. ‚ÄúYou are a fcking whre, don‚Äôt dare come close to me again!‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt hide how much pain he suffered from at that moment.¬†His all world collapsed. He heard rumors about Lucy, but he loved her blindly. The Alpha couldn't believe that his beloved mate would be able to cheat on him. He treated her as his queen, his future Luna, and instead of enjoying the special treatment, she ashamed him in exchange.*

*‚ÄúSon! Stop it!‚Äù his father shouted at him. After watching his daughter momentarily, the Beta walked to the Gamma, pulled him up, and threw his unconscious body out of the room.*

*‚ÄúTake him into the prison, "" he ordered the guards, who patiently waited outside, appalled.They looked at each other in disbelief, as they would have expected them to call a doctor for him, but the guards held the Gamma quickly, and they took him away.*

*The Beta held his sobbing daughter inside the room and looked at the young Alpha.*

*‚ÄúYou should have protected her better. How come an Alpha let its mate go through this? Where have you been? You should have been here next to her. How could I trust you from now on?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to worry about that, Beta.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt need your daughter, even if she would be the last female on earth. She is nothing more than a shameful liar, a slut*.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt dare talk about her like that,‚Äù the Beta shouted, and he took the first step towards him when they heard the old Alpha shout. ‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù

The Beta stopped and looked at the old Alpha with a frown.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll investigate the entire case, but till then you all must calm down.‚Äù He said, but his son looked at his father in disbelief.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to investigate the case, father. You would only waste your time. I don‚Äôt need her anymore.‚Äù The Alpha turned around to look into the sobbing Beta woman‚Äôs eyes filled with fear.

‚ÄúYou will not exist for me from now on. Don't dare come close to me, or talk to me. You are nothing for me, and I regret that I have ever accepted you as my mate.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon!‚Äù His father shouted, but the young Alpha motioned him to let him speak.

‚ÄúBeta Lucy Norman, I reject you as my mate and future Luna. Don‚Äôt dare to appear in my sight anymore. Never!‚Äù He shouted the last word like he was out of his mind. His father held him and dragged him out of the room as he saw the Beta was about to attack him, defending his sobbing daughter, who seemed close to fainting.

‚ÄúAccept my rejection, you wh\*re!‚Äù The young Alpha shouted back before they would step out of the door. He wanted to continue, but his father forced him to leave.

‚ÄúNever! I will never accept your rejection!‚Äù She sobbed while she laid her head on her father‚Äôs chest.

# Chapter 2 Olivia

**8 years later**

*It was a rainy day, about three o‚Äôclock in the morning. It was a Friday, so London‚Äôs streets were full of drunk and drugged people who continued partying on the streets or trying to find their homes.*

*However, the situation in the major hospital's emergency department worsened every minute. Most of the patients got there with alcohol poisoning, and some of them overdosed on some drugs. Many people got involved in fights, which caused broken bones or stab wounds. It seemed like the night was never-ending.*

*‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù a doctor pulled the curtain open and stepped to the bed‚Äîa man lay there, his arm full of fresh and dried blood.*

*‚ÄúA deep but clear cut on the forearm, Dr. Flores.‚Äù A nurse responded to the attractive doctor.*

*Dr Olivia Flores was a surgeon in the A&E department. Although she seemed young, her experience and manner of treating people made other doctors and nurses think she had been practising for much longer than she claimed. They weren‚Äôt wrong, but they never questioned her further.*

*Olivia was a fantastic doctor and very attractive as a woman. She had a slender figure but wasn‚Äôt too tall or short. Olivia had natural black hair and eyes like the coldest blue ocean. Her skin was white like she had never seen the Sun, but her full lips were red like blood. She was like a living porcelain doll. Many doctors tried to get close to her, but she refused all of them because she didn‚Äôt want to get involved in a relationship.*

*She didn‚Äôt seek a partner. Even if she was lonely and missed being loved, she couldn‚Äôt let others know what she was. She couldn‚Äôt let any human realise her ice-cold skin, her no-beating heart and her actual age.¬†Olivia must have kept a secret that the feared creatures from horror movies, vampires, existed, and she was one of them.*

*She had a few affairs in her life. She tried to be with other vampires, but their relationships always failed, primarily because of their different eating habits.*

*She tried to move into vampire communities, but again, she couldn‚Äôt bear the barbeque parties, as the vampires called them, where humans were the threats. Olivia would never forget those nights when the group leader brought some innocent humans to the premises. The fear was written on their faces, and to hear them beg for their life and then cry for their mothers damaged her for her long life. He left immediately, and she promised never to try to live again in such a community.*

*But she was a young vampire, only about two hundred years old back then. How old was she now? She couldn‚Äôt tell. She stopped counting it after four hundred years while moving around the world.*

*Especially after experiencing the fear of human beings, Olivia never wanted to hurt people, but she needed blood, of course. There was a period in her life when she lived with other creatures, living the same life as her. She found a small community where she felt good again. In a few years, she became part of a group of scientists trying to know creatures other than humans. They examined the bodies and helped them heal when all the doctors failed, but the community members also had the chance to do experiments. Her target was to find a way to live without blood, but she was unsuccessful. During these years, she only practised bearing her hunger, but she did that very well. She needed a sachet of blood each half year, which she always took from the hospital secretly. That was why it was so beneficial for her to be a doctor in the human world.*

*Because she never looked older, she never spent over ten years in one place. Moving was always a lot of work, but it was necessary, as humans couldn‚Äôt know their existence. Many believed they existed, but they weren‚Äôt allowed to confess that.*

*One of the communities‚Äô leaders could execute vampires who couldn‚Äôt keep the rules.¬†And that was all the vampire‚Äôs biggest fear, including Olivia.*

*‚ÄúI cleaned the wound. A nurse will bandage it for you, Mr. Rest your arm for a few days, keep the bandage dry and clean. My colleagues will inform you when to come back to change it. If it hurts too much, you can take some ibuprofen.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThank you, Dr.‚Äù The human looked at Olivia with gratefulness. Probably, he was involved in a fight, but she didn‚Äôt ask. His wound wasn‚Äôt serious at all, so there was no need to involve the police.*

*She closed the curtain and went to the following folder. Then, she sighed and went to see the next patient.*

*At eight o‚Äôclock in the morning, she sat down in the hospital‚Äôs restaurant. Of course, she bought a coffee, which she never drank, but she needed a break. Not that she was tired physically. She treated twelve lightly injured people, a very ill little girl, and she had three life-saving operations. Even though she was a vampire and stronger than a human, she also loved to sleep. That helped her mind rest, and she hadn‚Äôt slept for three days. She looked around and smiled at the thought that she would miss this place.*

*‚ÄúAre you done?‚Äù Another doctor stepped at her table. She looked up at her and nodded with a smile. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWell, I wish you good luck in the new place. Hopefully, it won‚Äôt be as mad as this one.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThank you, Laura.‚Äù Olivia smiled back. It was her last day here, and she sat at her table with the coffee she would throw away.*

*After she forced herself to stand up, she took her belongings and walked down the hall. At the main reception, everyone said farewell to her and wished her luck with her new job.*

*Even though she had experienced it so many times, she still loved the feeling that people would honestly miss her.*

*She walked out and sat in her car. Then, she turned on the engine and drove back to her apartment.*

*When she stepped inside, the apartment echoed because of the empty rooms and places, just like usual. Even if she was all packed, that changed nothing in the flat. She didn‚Äôt like to buy stuff. Because she moved a lot, she didn‚Äôt want to be attached to anything.*

*She laid down on her inflatable mattress, and she fell asleep quickly.*

*The following day, she showered and got dressed. Then, she had a last look at the place where she had spent the previous ten years. With a sad smile, she stepped out and walked down with her only luggage in her hand. She put the items into her car and drove to her next home, Middlesbrough.*

*It wasn‚Äôt unfamiliar to her. She used to live here a long time ago.*

*She rented out the flat a few weeks ago. She knew where she was going. When she arrived, she looked around, satisfied. This was her home for the next ten years. She hesitated a lot before moving here, as it wasn‚Äôt too far from London, but she wanted to move to the north so much that she only hoped she wouldn‚Äôt meet anyone from her past ten years.*

*She lit some candles and lay in the bath. Even though her body was naturally cold, she enjoyed the warm water. She loved feeling her body warmed up, and it relaxed her.*

*The next day was her first day in the new hospital. It was huge, just like the one in London, but this one looked colder. She had worked here before, but the entire building looked different at that time.*

*‚ÄúMay I help you?‚Äù A young blonde receptionist asked her when she stepped to the desk. Olivia smiled at her.*

*‚ÄúYes. My name is Dr. Olivia Flores. This is my first day here.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù the receptionist looked at her surprised. ‚ÄúI call someone to come. Which department?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúA&E.‚Äù*

*As the woman stood up and walked to another phone, Olivia‚Äôs gaze was fixed on someone. He stood there, and he probably heard everything.*

*When their gazes met, Olivia felt something unfamiliar. She couldn‚Äôt describe that feeling, but her heart probably would have beat crazily if her heart had beat.*

*The man‚Äôs gaze remained serious, and he didn‚Äôt look away. They were staring at each other for a few moments. The man had black hair and an unusually muscular body, and he was a little taller than Olivia. His skin was white, but probably he enjoyed the Sun a lot, and his eyes were brown. She felt like the air froze, and she could only think of what he was and that they would work in one place.*",1,1746874606.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

He wouldn't even bother sending cute long messages, voice mails, or voice messages. Wouldn't bother telling me where he was or what he was doing. If I asked, it would be like pulling a tooth out.

I was a single mom of two, and very anxious about dating to begin with. Their father is about as useful as a fly, only seeing them every other weekend and never following parenting rules/safety guidelines which in turn makes my life harder.

Anyway : so I met my boyfriend and we were inseparable, he was very kind and respectful and just honestly the man of my dreams in every way possible up until he wasn‚Äôt. I lived alone, with my kids and my dog in my OWN HOUSE in a nice development that was equally 20 minutes away from my grandparents who are very involved in my kids lives (to which I‚Äôm so grateful for because they‚Äôre all I really have).

My boyfriend lived over an hour away, and by 6 months had chosen to move into my house. He was then driving close to 3 hours a day to work, and back and had school twice a week to which he would come home late. I understood it was a lot for him, and so I made up in anyway I could.

I packed his lunches, prepped his coffee, did his laundry, I did all the shopping, I mean everything. He had to do nothing aside of mow my small lawn maybe once a week in the summer or ‚Äúfix stuff‚Äù so my grandpa didn‚Äôt have to.

Fast forward - by September/Nov. we were looking for a house closer to work for him, and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to move too far because of emergencies. Well, we end up falling in love with a nice wooded almost 4 acre property, with a shop for him of course - an hour and 10 minutes from my family. We settled on the house, and ever since then he has been a literal fucking nightmare.

Treating me like shit, constantly snapping on me and the kids, never wanting to actually be around me, the list could go on and on and on. Now granted, he‚Äôs the one who ‚Äúwanted a property with acreage and didn‚Äôt want neighbors‚Äù and he finally got that, but now does nothing but complain about all of the work it takes.

The property has a beautiful pond, and I‚Äôve always wanted Koi. I have no friends around here, no family no nothing. He wanted to fill the entire pond in with dirt, I didn‚Äôt. He helped me restore it, and he‚Äôs helping me catch fish to remove because it‚Äôs overcrowded. Well. That came with a big price, and I wasn‚Äôt aware of that either. It just seems like anything I do want to do or enjoy he has to have a problem with, or he‚Äôs ‚Äúconstantly trying to prove a point or teach me a lesson‚Äù.

I take care of my two girls, I got a puppy for us because he hated my dog, like I do all the cooking, cleaning, caring for my kids, grocery shopping, prepping, laundry, etc etc etc. but if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp out‚Äù enough with the OUTSIDE WORK - I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpulling my weight‚Äù. It‚Äôs like the dude wants me to do everything and THEN SOME and suffer in the meantime. I mean did he think he was just gonna have to work, come home and sleep and do nothing aside of that? With a property like this??

It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day weekend, and he saw me busting my ass all day yesterday trying to catch up on cleaning the girls room, cleaning the house, making dinner, cleaning up, laundry, shower and bedtime with my kids, vacuuming the rest of the first floor‚Ä¶ he left a bucket of fish on the patio and told me to ‚Äúgo dump it‚Äù while I was busy doing everything and I forgot about it because of the other SHIT I WAS DOING.

He comes in here at 3:30 in the morning, wakes me up RUDELY to tell me ‚ÄúI have a lot to clean up tomorrow - the animals outside got fish guts  all over the place‚Äù because I forgot about the bucket‚Ä¶ he knows I don‚Äôt sleep well, he knows I get anxious and upset easy, and here I am two hours later and can‚Äôt sleep. I said ‚Äúdude you could have just gotten it for me you saw all the shit I was doing and I forgot‚Äù. He said ‚Äúyou expected me to do that for you‚Äù and I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just doing something nice for somebody when you see they‚Äôre busy doing everything else dude‚Äù.

I‚Äôm constantly doing things without even thinking twice and I‚Äôd give you the shirt off my back, my grandparents raised me that way. Maybe that‚Äôs the problem, I expect men to men like the old days and I just don‚Äôt think they exist anymore. He was sitting on his ass on the couch while I was doing all of the above mind you.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, so I guess my main question for all the men on here is : Why would you uproot your girlfriend and her two kids over an hour from everybody and everything she‚Äôs ever known and promise things would get easier when you‚Äôre not tired from driving 3 hours a day and then turn into a monster the week you move into the new house?",3,1746874365.0,self,0,1.0,False

1kj7gda,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kj7gda,This planet was a total buzzkill,"Yesterday morning I woke up, made coffee, hit the pen and found a Paradise Planet in the Mirnoeg-Huca system that didn't have any Sentinel activity! Flew around, found a good landing spot, and found an A-level mineral deposit within the first try! Great! Made a couple of flora and fauna discoveries and started walking toward the deposit, thinking I'd have a base established and a solar array powering mineral extractors in no time, when something hit me just as my scanner was analyzing the deposit. I turned around, and the next thing I knew I was being simultaneously attacked by two different herds of the two species I'd just discovered. **What the hell are those things???**

The tiny headed triceratops monsters were at me first, one nipping at my feet and the rest closing in quick from six o'clock, the other ones that looked like H.R. Giger slept with a velociraptor were coming in from ten o'clock. I think I woke the whole apartment building up when I yelled ""SHIT!!!!"" and started fumbling with that stupid D-pad, trying to summon my shuttle while running away. I basically said screw it and cut my losses, happy to hit escape velocity and put Aucraw Maeba in the rearview. As I was flying back to my freighter, I remembered the scene from the very end of Don't Look Up! where everyone sets foot on their new home only to be slaughtered by carnivorous birds in a matter of seconds and I started laughing my ass off!

Anyway, be prepared for very aggressive fauna if you visit. If I could leave a Yelp review I'd give it two stars, but that's only because I have the rewired scope in my multitool that increases fauna discovery rewards by like 10,000%",1,1746874149.0,nomanshigh,0,0.67,False

1kj7g5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kj7g5f/spoilers_a_widowers_perspective_on_the_game_the/,"[SPOILERS] A widower's perspective on the game, the ending etc.","Hi everyone.

First, let me just say that I'm sure my wife would have loved this game. We watched Christopher Odd play through the preview while we were at the hospital, but sadly she passed away at the beginning of April. I wish I could say she had a good, long life - truth is she was in her thirties. She was at a time when after struggling to make ends meet all her life, she could finally enjoy some comfort, some stability, start to think about planning a future instead of having to focus on how to survive in the short term - and that's when, a couple months after moving in together, we learned that she had a particularily rare and agressive form of cancer. We've lived a few good months with our own monolith on the horizon, not knowing exactly how much time we would have, only that it would be too short.

  
Something a bit strange is that I understand both the Expeditionner's perspective in the prologue, and the perspective of those who stay and wait for their Gommage. Even though we knew that except for a miracle, there wasn't much we could hope for, she still chose to undergo the nastiest chemo, the pills, the injections, the nausea, the hair loss. She still chose to fight and to hope in a hopeless situation. And at the same time, what we most desperately held on to were the most simple things of our daily lives, our little boring routines as a couple. I guess it wasn't really by choice - I know we all like to ask ourselves that question from time to time, ""if you only had 6 months to live, what would you do?"" and we like to think we'd get up to crazy shenanigans. Truth is, with all the medical appointments and the ups and downs that come with both the illness and the treatments, you can't get too crazy anyways. But to be honest, I don't think I would have it any other way, cause you know what, our little routines is what I end up missing the most. 

  
So anyways, end of the prologue? I was right there in Guestave's shoes just three weeks prior. Saying it hit hard would be an understatement, but at the same time, I've been feeling that way pretty much everyday, every morning that I wake up alone since her passing. In a way, seeing Gustave experience what I've experienced made me feel less lonely. But I really have to commend the writers, the animators, the mo-cap and voice actors and the composer and performers. Attempting such a scene with Ubisoft quality writing would have been a disaster, and in my situation, it would surely have made me quit the game, no matter its other qualities. Instead, even though it was a terribly sad experience for me, I felt respected in my grief, I felt understood. And for that, I want to say thank you to everyone involved.

  
Now, about the ending. I've seen there's a lot of debate between the Verso/Ma√´lle ending. I won't pretend like there is an objectively right or wrong answer, so what follows is just my flawed and subjective opinion, and again, if you chose differently, I'm not saying you're wrong. I ended up siding with Verso. It's a weird case of, I think he's right, even though my heart disagrees with him. I've been struggling, and I will continue for a long time to struggle with loss. What I find hard with the death of a loved one is the permanence of it. You can't go back. If I had that possibility, I don't see how I wouldn't abuse it.  What made me chose Verso is that simple question : what would I give for another morning coffee with my wife? How many years of my life? The answer is also exceedingly simple : everything. 

But fortunately or unfortunately, that's not how it works. That's not what my wife would have wanted. That's not what Verso wanted. He sacrificed himself to save Alicia. I don't trust her not to lose herself, because I wouldn't trust myself, and in that I admit I might be wrong. 

I'll also admit that this whole argument is putting aside the realness of Sciel, Lune, Monoco and all the others, which is a blind spot in this reasoning. Again, this is not objective truth: I will fully admit that in that moment, I ""unsuspended"" my disbelief and thought ""This is a work of art that's trying to convey a message for me"" - and Verso's side was what felt ""right"" in my specific situation.

  
Anyways, thanks if you've read this far.",16,1746874124.0,expedition33,4,0.87,False

In these years, I've met people from all kinds of backgrounds, exchanged countless messages, had coffee table conversations that led nowhere, and faced ghosting without a second thought. If I had to sum it up in one line: it's starting to feel more like a transaction than a connection.
And I know I‚Äôm not the only one. This community is full of people like me‚Äîpeople who are genuinely trying, yet constantly hitting a wall.

Some common patterns we all face:

Ghosting after 1‚Äì2 conversations ‚Äî no closure, no reason.
Unrealistic expectations ‚Äî emotional availability, six-figure income, perfect height, shared parenting, and whatnot‚Äîwhile you can‚Äôt even talk for more than 10 minutes.
Mismatch of values ‚Äî people unsure of what they want, or heavily driven by family pressure.
High-pressure bios ‚Äî where it feels like one small thing can make or break the match.
Lack of effort from both sides ‚Äî as if we're all just waiting for the other person to impress us.
At this point, I realized: why not take a different route? We all come here to share, to vent, to get advice‚Äîbut can we also try using this community to actually connect?
What if we could talk directly, without the over-polished filters and rehearsed intros? Just two people trying to understand if there's a chance to grow together.
So, here I am, putting myself out there genuinely.

About Me:
Name: Will share in DM
Age: 33
Location: Mumbai 
Height: 5‚Äô3‚Äù
Weight: 86 kg
Complexion: Wheatish
Profession: Managing family-run Business
Education: PGDM in Business Management
Lifestyle:
Drinks socially‚Äîabout 2‚Äì3 times a year
Doesn't smoke cigarettes, but enjoys sheesha once a week with friends

Spirituality: Rooted in faith, but not rigid

Family: Gujarati Jain nuclear family, strong values, supportive environment

Residence: Self-owned house in Mumbai

Personality: Calm, emotionally mature, humorous, loves deep conversations, focused on building a meaningful life with a partner who‚Äôs equally involved

Finances: Stable, secure, capable of sustaining a good lifestyle with scope for growth

What I‚Äôm Looking For:
Someone who wants to build something together. I‚Äôm not looking for perfection, I‚Äôm looking for partnership.
Someone who:
Values emotional maturity and open communication
Believes in shared decision-making and genuine teamwork
Has her own identity and passions‚Äîbut wants to blend it with someone else‚Äôs
Doesn't see marriage as a checkmark‚Äîbut as a space to grow, learn, fall, laugh, love and support
I am happy to support my future partner‚Äôs dreams‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs career, travel, or personal growth‚Äîand I hope she would support mine too. Equality, for me, isn‚Äôt about splitting bills. It‚Äôs about showing up for each other.
We‚Äôll figure out the rest as we go.

If this resonates with you‚Äîor someone you know‚Äîdrop me a message. Let‚Äôs try something different this time.
Maybe we won‚Äôt find ""the one"" instantly, but even a genuine conversation can bring clarity, comfort, and who knows‚Äîmaybe the start of something real.
Let‚Äôs normalize intentional dating within arranged setups. Let‚Äôs rewrite how this works.

I managed to pick up this Daemon Prince prebuilt in an eBay lot of vintage Eldar and Imperial Guard I got to build out my 90s era armies. It's my first Chaos model, so just kinda went with it rather than following box art. 

Made the base from a wood offcut (hole saw) and milliput. Dremel to chop out the valley. Coffee grounds and acrylic paint for texture. 

Considering adding some weathering /scarring, maybe some more highlights and brightening up the gold. What would you do?

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1kj75j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kj75j6/what_to_do_next_stuck_maintaining/,What to do next? Stuck maintaining :(,"I've been in a calorie deficit since literally January 2024. Obviously I took a couple breaks, but since then I've been pretty comitted to it. I track perfectly, and use a food scale.

I started at 168, and I'm now at 137. I'm 5'2 28F, and my goal weight is simply to be in the 120s. My thighs and stomach are just a tad fluffier then I want them to be.

A couple weeks ago I found myself frustrated because after a week of being in a strict deficit I saw no progress. I know this isn't long, but my scale normally went down every 2-3 days of being in a decent deficit, (I was eating 1500-1600 and walking 4+ miles a day) assuming I didn't end up constipated or anything. I got a bit frustrated and lowered my calories temporarily to 1000 (which I know it's healthy long term but I literally did it for like 4 days) then up to 1200. I then saw 5 pounds come off in the span of those 4 days (142->137)

A week later, my intake has been between 1200-1500 and my activity level has been insaneeee. I've been hiking with friends and did 8 miles one day. I expected SOME progress. Anything. But somehow, I have maintained the exact same weight.
I've done very light weight training which i highly doubt resulted in any significant muscle gain to cancel out a fat loss on the scale..I mean I do feel over all leaner but it's really hard to tell. I just do weighted (15lb) squats right now. 

Before anyone says ""I'm not tracking right."" I AM. I track meticulously. I weight the milk that goes in my coffee, the chicken in my lunch, literally everything. Honestly I stick to easy to track foods because I don't want to make mistakes. And again I've lost 30 pounds - I know how to track and I know I'm doing it properly. I'm also not counting my exercise, so any additional calories burned are just calories burned.

Google has told me a number of things..my metabolism could be screwed from dieting for a year, and I might need to eat more? A bunch of people also said that they don't lose weight for 1-2 weeks and then see multiple pounds come off. While that traditionally hasn't been my normal I'm wondering if things are changing.

I just need advice where to go from here. I'm simply not happy at 137 and refuse to just let this be my set weight. I would even take 129 - a couple pounds weight loss makes a huge different for my body because of my height. What can I do to get these last pounds off? Is it possible that I'm still losing fat and I'll see a drop in the scale soon? I'm on day 7 of no change in the scale. Last plateau was 10 days before I saw a 5 pound drop.

Appreciate any insight! This has been super frustrating:/

1kj742s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1kj742s/before_you_jump_into_arranged_marriagelook_around/,"Before You Jump into Arranged Marriage,Look around you first","

If you‚Äôre in your late 20s or early 30s, the pressure to get married ‚Äî especially via the arranged route ‚Äî can be suffocating. Parents start dropping hints, friends begin ‚Äúsettling down,‚Äù and society makes you feel like you‚Äôre behind in the race. But before you submit your bio-data, upload your best photos to a matrimonial app, or start meeting strangers over awkward coffee dates, here‚Äôs a grounded suggestion: look around you first. Seriously.

We often overlook the most obvious path ‚Äî connecting with someone from your existing network. Whether it‚Äôs an old friend, a college acquaintance, a colleague, or even a friend of a friend, 
starting with someone familiar or at least from a familiar circle can create a huge difference.

Familiarity Builds Safety

When someone is from a known circle, there‚Äôs an unspoken sense of safety. There‚Äôs a higher chance they share your background, values, or at the very least, someone you trust knows them well. That creates a comfort level you won‚Äôt get from meeting a total stranger with a scripted biodata and 30-minute ‚Äúget-to-know-you‚Äù session.

Talk First. Labels Can Come Later.

Drop the pressure of ‚Äúfinding someone to marry‚Äù and just focus on *talking* to people. Keep it real. Explore what they‚Äôre looking for. Share where you are in life ‚Äî not just professionally but emotionally, mentally, financially. Sometimes just one deep, honest conversation can tell you more than five arranged dates ever will.

Be Transparent About These Things:

Your expectations from marriage (not fantasy, but reality)
Your work-life setup (do you have time for a partner?)
Your income and financial responsibilities
Your boundaries and values (gender roles, family involvement, lifestyle, etc.)
What you expect from a partner emotionally, practically, and mentally

Don‚Äôt be vague. Don‚Äôt try to impress. Just be honest ‚Äî with them and with yourself.

Effort Comes Easier with Known Sources

When something begins from a known connection, people tend to put in more effort ‚Äî because they already have some respect or trust in place. You‚Äôre not starting from zero. You're not busy trying to ‚Äúprove‚Äù you‚Äôre a decent human. The process becomes less of a checklist, and more of a real bond-building exercise.

Arranged Marriage Isn‚Äôt the Villain ‚Äî But It‚Äôs Not the Only Path

It works for many. But it also fails when expectations aren‚Äôt aligned, or both people are playing roles society gave them. Don‚Äôt jump in because it‚Äôs ""time."" Jump in when you're clear, open, and feel ready to take responsibility for someone else‚Äôs emotional life ‚Äî not just your own.


Don't Just Look for Compatibility ‚Äî Look for Willingness**

Two people can be wildly different but still thrive ‚Äî *if* both are willing to adjust, learn, grow, and communicate. A known prospect might just make that transition smoother because there‚Äôs less posturing and more realness.

Bottom Line
Before stepping into the structured but often cold and robotic world of arranged matchmaking, take a pause. Look at who‚Äôs already around you ‚Äî maybe someone in your extended network, maybe a friendship that has more potential, maybe even someone who shares the same frustrations and expectations.

You might just save yourself months (or years) of uncertainty and mismatches.

And who knows ‚Äî maybe what you‚Äôre looking for has been in front of you all along.",6,1746872763.0,Arrangedmarriage,3,0.69,False

We can get along, but I don't see us ever dealing with each other outside of work. One thing she does that I find annoying is we often get food and beverages provided and she'll take it ""for later"". Then says she either threw it away or gave it to her child.

I have a coworker I do like, but they do more traveling. They're at my site certain days. We get together for breakfast and lunch. When we do this in office, we bring extra food/drinks for other coworkers. The first time annoying coworker was here for a breakfast, I asked if she wanted any of the food/drinks. She clearly doesn't like the type or brand I purchased.  Before walking away, she took a lot and a drink and said ""I'll give it to my child"".

I didn't like my food imo being wasted like this. When I buy breakfast now, I tell the workers I like about and it do in a conference room. This has been going on for two months now. I guess someone told her. On Friday, she was like ""Did (the company) bring this?"". I said ""This is a working breakfast. If you want to join us, you can."" She started asking all of these weird questions. Acting like we were eating out of garbage cans. I said ""Annoying coworker, either you want to eat something or let us work. If you don't want something, I bought it and if there's left overs I want to bring it for ""later"" or for ""my family"". "".She twisted her face, but left.

I think I'm right but a few coworkers said I was talking about her daughter. I wasn't, but I didn't want to hear the song and dance. If you're not eating it, I'm giving to someone I actually like. I'm not running a snack shack for kids.
