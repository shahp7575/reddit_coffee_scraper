**I (m35) have been friendzoned by my wife (f34)**



Married for six years, together for eight.

Overall we've had a happy marriage, have had common goals for what we want to do in life, and we even started working together a year or so into our relationship.

But something happened at the start of this year. I got a promotion which required me to work long and wonky hours which left us less time together. Maybe one day a week that we could go out and do things. I felt like we were making a converted effort to spend time together and I called her on my breaks and when I was on the way home. Stuff like that.

Fast forward to two months ago. I notice she's been very invested in her online friend group that she games with and had been spending long hours with them even on days that we were supposed to spend time together. Sex had mostly dried up save for a lone isolated incident where she became overwhelmed by horniness while at work and felt like she wanted to tackle the nearest guy. She rushed home and we had great sex. But something lurked in the back of my mind about this incident. We haven't had any sort of sexual intimacy since this event which was maybe three months ago.

Anyway, two months ago we end up having a fight where I, in essence, say that she doesn't really want to be in this relationship. And that's when she drops the bombshell that she and fallen out of love with me over the last month or so. The time table for falling out of love is nebulous at this time but it's most certainly this year.

I was devastated because I knew something funky was happening but we'd been so close and so in-sync for years that I didn't even consider that she had lost her feelings for me. She said she still cares for me dearly but sees me as sort of like a neighbor or roommate or something.

I spiraled into depression and decided to devote every waking hour to saving our relationship. We took a week off work and went on many dates and I tried everything I knew to do to reconnect. At our zenith, she said she loved me like a family member. But that she just wasn't ""in love"" or romantic love.

So a couple days ago I'm like... Okay, maybe you should get your own place for awhile? I'm still very much in love and attracted and care so much for her but the sting of rejection every time I look in her eyes is extremely painful.

She had said at various points over the last couple months that she had a longing for something new. Somewhere new. An adventure. That's the key reason for me to ask her to leave. I'm not going to trap her in a marriage where she knows she can't fulfill her end of things and she knows I'm unhappy.

My question is this, my family and friends have been disagreeing with our plans moving forward and said we should exhaust all efforts before moving into a break or separation territory. I feel like I'm smothering her with my needs and desires while she lives here. Do I have my head up my behind?

Or, is this just kind of how marriages go after a time? My parents had long years of lovelessness and eventually divorced. Maybe things just eventually morph into a friendship over time and I'm the strange one for still wanting intimacy?

Tl;Dr my wife no longer has romantic feelings for me and wants to seek something new. I asked her to leave. Am I being dumb?

*I wasn't married, but I was in a 12 year long relationship that I decided to end once she told me she wasn't attracted to me anymore. She still loved me (and I loved her) because we were together for so long and we really were best friends... But that was it, we were just friends by the end. And I was still attracted to her, but I couldn't force her to be with me. It is true what they say: if you truly love someone, let them go. It will hurt you, but not as much (or as long) as sticking with a relationship where you're not wanted anymore. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel loved the way you need to. You'll find someone, I assure you.*

>OOP: Thank you so much for your kindness. I agree that staying in a relationship where I'm not being reciprocated will lead to all sorts of bad things. I absolutely don't want to search extramaritally for solutions to my needs.

>I hope you have found what you need as well.



**Endonium**

*Bro, you‚Äôre missing the point here. She‚Äôs checked out. Game over. Pack it up and move on. You're clinging to a sinking ship, my dude. Sure, try to save it if you want, but it sounds like she's already got one foot out the door.*

*You‚Äôre not being dumb for wanting intimacy; that‚Äôs normal. But you are being dumb if you think you can force her to stay in love with you. Let her go and focus on yourself. You deserve someone who actually wants to be with you. And seriously, stop trying so hard to save something that‚Äôs already dead. Life's too short for that nonsense.*

>OOP: It's just so hard to accept that something is dead when it feels so goddamn sudden. Months is all it takes to entirely lose love?? I don't understand. Did she not see that this was happening? Did she not even care to say anything?  
  
It's just so hard to understand.





**Update - 2 months later**



Read my post history if you're interested in what's gone on. Anyway! Wife and I are separating. She fell out of love. 6 years of marriage.

She's moved out to an apartment about half an hour away. We don't talk much anymore. We are civil when we do talk and neither of us have the intention to hurt each other.

She doesn't want me. I've mostly made peace with that. But I do want a partner. Someone to share life with.

But I don't know if I should wait until I'm done mourning my relationship or try to find someone now. I absolutely do not want to hurt anyone by potentially ""rebounding"" but I very much want to fill this gnawing void within me.

Maybe my wife will refind within herself the reason we were together in the first place. And at the time maybe she will try to get back together. Lots of ifs and buts.

But I also know what I need in life. I need someone else. What do I do?

Tl;dr: my wife has moved out and I'm not sure when I should seek someone else.

*I mean. Look at what you wrote. ‚ÄúI very much want to fill this gnawing void within me.‚Äù Another person doesn‚Äôt deserve to be a plug, something you use to relieve your pain. Most people dating are looking for a partner, and you‚Äôre not ready to be that for anyone right now.*



**ancora\_impara**

*She moved away - you're good to go EXCEPT you'll very quickly want a rebound - it happens - and there are woman in your age group who are becoming aware of their biological clock and want children. How do I know that? I was in your shoes. It's entirely fine to start a family but WAIT to do so until you've settled down mentally which is likely to take a year or two.*

*As for your EX-wife (yes, that's what she is and you have to start thinking of her like that) she'll be fine. Or she won't. Anyway, she's on her own and wants to be: move on.*



**Update - 3 months later**



The long and short is she has a new boyfriend after having moved out a couple months ago. He's someone she's been talking to since the beginning of the year. Only recently it's escalated, supposedly.

I only learned of this due to a mutual coworker like fifth-hand knowledge. I called my soon to be ex wife to get confirmation. I said to her ""some news has gotten back to me, do you have anything you'd like to get off your chest?""

After a long pause, she says ""I went on a date."" I knew this already so I said... And??

""and it went well""... And?

""and there was a fainting incident in the hot tub""... And?

""and what?"" and yalls got freaky right?

""well... We tried some things..."" girl... Don't lie to me.

""yes, we were intimate."" OK bye. My 2% hope that maybe eventually we'd get back together is officially gone. We haven't even filed any paperwork and she's already done nasty with an online dude. I get it. I see. I'm aware.

Now I'm going back through our relationship and really looking at things. She really isn't a good friend or family member or person. She was a good wife until she wasn't.

Thank y'all for your feedback and support during this time. It's been a huge huge eye opener as far as how much emotional capacity I was giving her on a daily basis. I didn't have anything left for anyone else. Now I'm spending tons of time with friend and family trying to form and keep connections.

There's always good with the bad and that's what I've noticed so far. My brother moved in with me and he's honestly been a godsend.

Tl;dr: wife left and found new guy. You all were right. I had my head up my ass. Now I'm sad but trying to enjoy friends and family. Thank you for your support.

*she's probably going to come back once the new thrill wears off with the current guy. do NOT take her back!!*



**ScaryShadowx**

>She really isn't a good friend or family member or person. She was a good wife until she wasn't.

*Hopefully this line sticks. My gf did this to me and it took me a while to recognize this. I don't want the person who I love to treat me the way she treated me, nor do I really think her values line up to mine anymore. Once I came to that realization, that she was no longer the same person I fell in love with, nor is she someone I would want as a friend if I had randomly met her today, it became much easier to move on.*

1hemaq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1hemaq4/reported_former_teacher_help/,Reported Former Teacher - Help? ,"this is a long LONG long story but I need outside opinions badly. 

I am 25f and I reported my former 54m high school teacher. 

I met him when I was 17 and when I was in his class, he immediately took a liking to me because I was so interested in the subject he taught I think, making me a TA for one of his classes and a student in another. He helped me SO much with my career. He taught photography and I ended up pursuing a career in what he taught - even going full time with my business when I was 22 because I was so busy. 

Other teachers often told me how much my teacher adored and loved me. I did not have a good home life and it felt so good to have somebody who thought I was great and supported me in something I was so passionate about. The school I went to was more personal and so this teacher shared his cell phone number with all of his students and him and I would frequently text photos we were working on (so it was related to what he taught ofc!). I didn‚Äôt even do homework in his class and he still passed me. When I was 17, I also stumbled across a social media page that was in my ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù that was linked to his phone number. It had suggestive photos and BDSM content. It made me super super uncomfortable and it sounds silly looking back but I didn‚Äôt know if he could get in trouble or anything and he had helped me SO much with my photography that I didn‚Äôt want to take that chance so I told him that I found that page as a heads up so he would remove his phone number from it. He was taking me to photograph a wedding with him 2 months later so I was genuinely worried he‚Äôd be mad I said something/found it and tell me nvm lol but he didn‚Äôt luckily. He told me another teacher convinced him to make that page and kept asking me if I could see it before he finally just deleted it. (And I still got to photograph the wedding hahah!) 

After I told him about this page, he also told me that him and his wife have an open relationship. It made me a little weirded out maybe but I thought he just trusted me. I think because I found that page - it opened the door to more casual conversations. I told him about some of my struggles and home life and he shared too and we had like a little mentor friendly supportive relationship. I was shy and sensitive and quiet and he always told me to stand up for myself and to speak up more and all this positive stuff about me. He even protected me when it came to other students and staff. He did make some weird comments in class and used pet names for the girls sometimes, the weirdest to me being ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù but I thought maybe he was just a little weird. 

I graduated and we started texting more casually. He told me about a teacher at the school that him and his wife have a relationship with and sometimes he‚Äôd send little flirty messages but I wasn‚Äôt an attractive girl and thought I was reading into it. He would sometimes complain about his wife to me, saying she was over emotional or got jealous easily. I moved a few months after graduation, and also went through an AWFUL breakup after moving. He was texting me at the time and he seemed to really care about me and I did rely on him for support (I feel so bad about this looking back but he didn‚Äôt tell me to stop? I wish he would have). 

Well then I made a stupid decision and slept with this older guy (read: sugar daddy lol). And I felt guilty and he had been texting me so I told him. I really needed support and I didn‚Äôt have anyone else. I know that was so awful to do, but he had been open with me about his sex life and I thought he would be a safe person. He didn‚Äôt judge me and just told me to be careful and that he was there for me and it‚Äôs all fun and fine, maybe I just like older guys etc. and then things picked up. And I would lean on him for support while I hooked up with older guys and went through life transitions like moving out on my own, my family issues, etc. and he would brag and tell me about his sex life and make flirty sexual jokes, comments that seemed to be hinting at things, etc. At first I just laughed it off but eventually I did hand some back. 

I was 19 so I don‚Äôt know why I thought it was okay and honestly he had been there for me and was someone I DEEPLY admired and trusted and idk I did have a bit of a crush on him but I‚Äôd never told him obviously lol. I thought if it wasn‚Äôt ok he would tell me, especially since he had made so many comments idk. There were times where I‚Äôd be talking and telling him about my anxiety and he‚Äôd tell me to go masturbate and it‚Äôll go away, or I‚Äôd say ‚Äúhave fun on your trip!‚Äù And he‚Äôd say ‚Äúin a hotel room all alone.. with no one to have fun with‚Ä¶ so lame.‚Äù Or I‚Äôd ask how he was and he‚Äôd RANDOMLY say ‚Äúgood! How are you? Other than horny?‚Äù 

The problem is I never told him to stop, I just laughed it off. Idk. I think I was in shock that it was being said and also I liked his attention and I also did not want to lose the support he gave me. I also started dating my husband when I was 19. So this was going on while I was dating my husband and starting our relationship. 

When I was 20 was when things started to be a little weird. I posted something a little provacative on Twitter (not unusual at the time lol) and he texted me that a current student made note of something he liked of mine on Twitter and that since all his work people are on there that he has to unfollow me to be safe. I felt SO BAD and was so apologetic and he told me not to worry and that it wasn‚Äôt his boss who said anything. And he told me I‚Äôm in a much different place than he is, that I am 20 and he is 49 with a career and a family that could be lost in a tweet. I was so apologetic and told him that I hope he‚Äôs not mad at me and he said ‚Äúnever mad at you‚Äù and that was that. It felt weird to me so I screenshotted it. I thought our relationship had moved past like student/teacher because of the things he had talked to me about but I figured it was because I was still technically his student previously that he felt the need to say this. 

Things just continued on. Photo conversations, inappropriate conversations, and mental health check ins. It was confusing for me to understand what I was in the relationship. Former student? Friend? Was he interested in me? Just someone he casually tells all this intimate info to? Idk. It was really weird things though like he‚Äôd send me porn and photos of sex toys and tell me I needed them and ask me later ‚Äúdid you order your dragon dildo yet?‚Äù Lol like what??? Or he‚Äôd jokingly call himself ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù to me. ‚ÄúI can show you some things.. Come to daddy!‚Äù Or me talking about worries with a photography thing and he‚Äôd tell me he was going to ‚Äúgo BDSM and spank‚Äù me. 

When I was 21, he sent me photos of another former student topless. She was covering her breasts but she was topless. And he told me it was a former student and her boobs were jiggling all over the place and it was fun.. ‚Äúand she was a former student from like 6 years ago so it‚Äôs ok!!‚Äù And it felt weird to me. And I pointed out that he photographed her ALOT. Well‚Ä¶ next thing you know - he hid the galleries of her on his website. Which was weird to me. 

Later that year, I went to NYC solo and took so many amazing photos and shared them with him. He asked ‚Äúdo you have your own hotel room? Alone?‚Äù And told me I need to masturbate or find someone to have sex with while there. In response to me sharing what are probably the best photos I had ever taken, that I was SO proud of. That was weird to me. 

There were times over the relationship that some conflict occurred but I always backed down because he would always tell me I was overreacting and overthinking and to let it be and honestly this became a big internal thought of mine - that I was so sensitive and was always overreacting. 

Then a few months later, I told him I had a crush on him. I was 22 at the time. And I gave him every out possible to not talk to me. But it was killing me to not say anything. I didn‚Äôt understand the relationship and I wanted to. And his comments were killing me so I figured if I told him, then he would stop making the comments if he wasn‚Äôt interested. He just sent back demon emojis üòàüòàüòà and told me he was flattered and my secret was safe with him. 

Then a few months later, the teacher was coming to the city I lived in and said ‚Äúmaybe we can hangout while I‚Äôm there‚Äù. Well, my husband and I decided to impulsively elope and my husband had this GREAT (AWFUL!) idea to ask and just see if the teacher would be available if he could take a few pictures of us, since he‚Äôd be in town. The guy said he was honored at first and all this that he would absolutely do it. Then, he kept asking me to tell him the details. I kept telling him there weren‚Äôt any details and I asked if I could just text him the address because there weren‚Äôt any details really as it was just a little ceremony. Reciting an address on the phone seemed weird to me lol. And he lost his shit saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time to text for 14 f‚Äùn hours a day and all this‚Äù. I got off the phone SO fast because it made me cry. I was shocked he talked to me like that. I waited 24 hours to make sure and decided I was going to tell him it upset me. It probably wasn‚Äôt the best decision but I was uncomfortable. He told me his wife heard the whole thing and he didn‚Äôt yell at me and told me to calm down and this and that (I was very calm) and he ended up taking away an opportunity he had given me to photograph. I was moving back home in a week and I was so excited for that and I was crushed that he did that to me. 

I called him and tried to talk with him and he told me ‚ÄúI know it takes a lot of courage for you to share how you feel. But it‚Äôs too much. You‚Äôre too much‚Äù and it absolutely crushed me. I was finally feeling confident in who I was and it sent me into one of the worst spirals of my life. 

I reached out a month later asking if we could talk because I was confused about where things were left. He told me he didn‚Äôt remember any of that conversation or any of me asking him to photograph it and that I didn‚Äôt care about his side of the story, etc etc. I reiterated to him that I care ALOT about him and that I do care about his side and he said it was very ‚Äúemotionally mature‚Äù of me and then said ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre married now but I‚Äôll always be your #2.‚Äù What does that even mean? 

After that, we didn‚Äôt talk for a bit and then he started sending me SO many photo projects. It was great to have. I still kept a distance with him though and truthfully only sent short one word answers like ‚Äúthanks‚Äù ‚Äúok‚Äù ‚Äúsounds good‚Äù lol. I was scared after he hurt me so bad. I still carried the weight of him telling me I was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. I saw some comments online he made towards other former students and it reminded me of how he used to talk to me, the photos he sent of the girl, what he said about the twitter thing, all of that. I tried to make an anonymous report to the school in October 2023 because it didn‚Äôt feel right and I wanted to make sure he didn‚Äôt hurt other students. It got ignored. 

I got pregnant and he stopped sending me projects. I had my baby earlier this year. 

And after that, we did start talking again and it pretty immediately went back to the flirtatious and like ‚Äúsexual-confidant‚Äù conversations. He joked that he was going to send me a pic and I said ‚Äúplease do! Hahaha‚Äù and instead, he sent me a nude photo of his wife. Which was weird. I sent some suggestive photos of myself and he said ‚Äúmore! Lol‚Äù and we were talking and he said he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook‚Äù at me in high school and that he‚Äôs a male high school teacher and has to ‚Äúwatch himself‚Äù. Then he acknowledged this was after high school ‚Äúso it‚Äôs fair game‚Äù, I thought I finally got some clarity. I pursued it a bit more after that. He also told me he wonders if current girls in his class look at him like that but he watches the news and it scares him. That was weird to me. 

We kept flirting for months and I did send more explicit nude photos of myself. He told me some sexual comments. And eventually, I got the balls to just straight up ask because I was tired of the ambiguity. And honestly I was done not knowing. It‚Äôs been going on for 7 years. So I just asked if he‚Äôd ever have sex with me. I told him I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be attracted to me but he had been so ambiguous and hadn‚Äôt rejected me yet so I wanted to know. And his response was ‚Äúit‚Äôs not an attraction issue, it‚Äôs the student/teacher thing. But we should continue this conversation.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure how to interpret this? Because he told me it was fair game and we had talked about sex so much, what was the ‚Äúit‚Äù that was the student/teacher thing? It kinda shocked me honestly, as dumb as that sounds. 

 And I followed up and said i understood, let me know when you can talk basically. He didn‚Äôt respond but hearted it. I sent another message a few days later. No response. So a few days later I thought I took the hint and was just going to be done with the relationship so I said ‚ÄúI clearly misinterpreted hahah. Thanks for clarifying. Best of luck with everything!‚Äù And that‚Äôs when he decided to respond. He said he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to respond and it was the student teacher thing and when I asked what that meant he told me ‚Äúit has 0 to do with you. Im just not comfortable with it‚Äù and then I asked ‚Äúso you‚Äôre comfortable saying all the sexual things you have though?‚Äù And he told me that conversations are one thing and physical is a whole different situation. I explained that i understand and I just wish there was clear communication and that I want to understand. I said I‚Äôm not a teacher so please explain it to me. And he said basically we will get coffee again and discuss. And I told him I didn‚Äôt want to wait a long time again for a response because I was ruminating about it and it was affecting me and I wanted to make sure I understood the boundaries here, and he knew that.

 He didn‚Äôt get back to me so I decided I was done with the relationship. It had been over 2 weeks since I asked and the clarity was clearly not coming so I told him I didn‚Äôt think he still viewed me as a student and that I wouldn‚Äôt have trusted him with everything I did if I had known that, I told him that i used to think he cared about me but he has shown me over and over that he doesn‚Äôt. And that I was ending the relationship because I deserve clarity and respect and he wasn‚Äôt going to give that to me. He responded saying ‚Äú..?!?! I thought we were going to meet in person and discuss?!?!?!‚Äù But he literally didn‚Äôt respond or set a time. So guess who went off on me again with a bunch of random comments and accusations that were COMPLETELY unrelated to what I had thought at all. 

I clarified again and then I apologized if I made him feel pressured or anything, and I told him I care about how I made him feel and that I was just trying to understand. 

He gave me a dismissive ‚Äúall good‚Äù. 

So I hit him with a ‚Äúis it?‚Äù And called the school. 

During the time between these messages, he also posted a photo of himself taken outside of class by a student who is 17. Which was weird to me. She‚Äôs a minor and you‚Äôre hanging out with her outside of class? She reminded me a lot of me and she seemed to want to pursue photography as well and like she really admired him and his help. Along with everything else with other former students and how he has hurt me, it felt EXTREMELY wrong. 

_____ 

I talked to the VP and then the districts HR. They all said I was courageous and brave and did the right thing. I‚Äôve been in communication with them and have sent so much evidence and screenshots. Photos, screenshots, everything. I of course let them know I played into it too. I‚Äôm just worried. I‚Äôm worried for him, and worried I look crazy and am maybe being overemotional or too sensitive, and I‚Äôm worried he will lose his job, etc etc. I still do care SO MUCH about him - and I am working on that. 

I‚Äôm just feeling like I‚Äôm unsure I did the right thing or if it matters at all because I was a former student. And it wasn‚Äôt physical. 

There‚Äôs obviously so much that happened that wasn‚Äôt here also. 7 years of history. I‚Äôm in therapy working through this but I need an outside perspective. What the fuck happened? Did I do the wrong thing? How will this affect him if I was the only student? Does that still matter if it was after graduation? Is it normal for male teachers to keep in contact with so many female former students and to talk sexually with them? Am I delulu lol ",0,1734242323.0,Teachers,3,0.33,False

A couple folks had asked me to let them know my thoughts about a particular Rodem Slime I was considering buying if I actually did end up buying it. Then I had all these PinkSugarSlimey ones as well, so I thought I'd try putting them together as their own review here. So without further ado, let's start with Rodem:

**Rodem Slimes**

> Slime Name: Christmas Gift

* Texture: White Glue Square Block Crunch (in a 'cheese-like thick' base)

* Scent: Musk+Iris+Soft Powdery Ambrette Seed blended Perfume scent

* Thoughts: So happy I took my chances with this! Those who saw me asking about it may recall I was wondering if it was thick and resistant or loose and sploopy and I'm happy to say it's the former! It's not the thickest I've ever felt from Rodem (that would be Macaron Shop), to the point that you can definitely feel the pointy block squares (love that), but it's just the right amount in my opinion. And it is definitely resistant; plenty of pulls started to rip because I pulled just a tad too fast, which I like, but it still stretched well. And then the block squares were not only plentiful, and not only gave great crunch, but also helped trap air for great pops. Pops galore here, just absolutely wonderful. Sometimes flecks of the slime would stick to my hand (which I call ""flecking"" for short) but it really was no big deal cause of how easy it was to get back in the slime. I find my super dry hands are more prone to it anyway. Then as for scent, I really liked it! It is gentle and pleasant, reminiscent of a really soft lotion.

Tldr: I don't give number scores so I'll just say this slime is great. Tons of pops, not sticky, great scent, lots of crunch from the beads, and real solid level of structure/resistance! Go get this imo!

> Slime Name: Cindy Lou

* Texture: White Glue Floam + 1 oz clear

* Scent: Pearberry + peach candy

* Thoughts: I smell equal parts pearberry and the peach candy. Fruity and not overwhelmingly sweet, a nice balance in my opinion! This was one I already knew I'd love, because I love Tori's floams. They're always silky, creamy, and loaded with crunchy pops, and this was no exception. The base as I said is silky, creamy etc., and it leans a little thin, but I think that suits this floam well. When you get to stretching it feels the perfect thickness so you can feel all the little beads (and this is quite packed with them). The pink clear topper was also quite thick and almost had a bouncy resistance when I pressed into it btw, loooved that. I'd play with a full size of that for sure. Man I'd shell out for that clear with say block beads or a fimo bomb in it. Anyway!

Tldr: A classic floam from Tori. Silky, creamy, crunchy, packed with floam and pops, and a delightful fruity candy smell. Can't ever go wrong with PSS floams!

> Slime Name: Mean One

* Texture: tri-snow butter

* Scent: Green apple candy, winter berries + a hint of Christmas trees

* Thoughts: Wow what a unique experience this was. Tori wasn't kidding when she said this had a chubby and chewy type of resistance. It was deceptive when I took it out the jar; at first touch it felt a tad wet (expected cause of the snow, I don't mind it) and just holding it made me think it'd be like a more typical looser snow butter. Nope! The amount of resistance on this guy was really pleasantly surprising, even a tiny bit of an arm workout! It really was enjoyable to stretch and fluff up, no tack for me either, and what was neat was when fluffed up it retained all of its structure. It was like if shaving cream was a little more, idk, stable, yet it still had this kind of jiggly bounce to it. So so so fun, the chubby chew makes it like, cushy. Like if you were to squeeze the kind of cushion of those booth seats at restaurants. Odd descriptor I know but it's the only thing I can picture. It does make some nice occasional pops as Tori advertised too. Scent is also just as unique to me. Definitely get the apple candy first, which is undercut with the berries, and then there's a definite lingering scent of the woodsy trees at the end. Almost kinda crisp in a way.

Tldr: The most unique slime in this bunch for sure. Super chubby and resistant in a way that makes it a pleasure to fluff, and the fluffed state is just as unique with this kind of like stiff shaving cream. Honestly my new fav type of snow butter.

> Slime Name: Christmas Wreath

* Texture: Jelly bingsu

* Scent: Bartlett Pear

* Thoughts: So I actually had a jelly bingsu before from this shop wayyy earlier in the year and it wasn't my cup of tea. Jelly was too loose for my tastes and had a lot of tack and flecking. However, I noticed Tori changed her jelly recipe at some point since because the Jaws jelly she had a few months back was AMAZING. Super thick and nontacky with great pops. So I thought I'd give this a try again and I'm glad I did! Just the right bit of resistance when pulling, thick, loaded with beads, and froths up like crazy. This like doubled in size easy. Not a hint of tack or stickiness this time around either, and it made a bunch of crunchies like bingsus should. Because it's a jelly they are not as 'crisp' as say a pure cg or wg bingsu would be but it's still plenty for me. Honestly I just enjoy stretching and fluffing this thing up, it gets so big and delightful to squish all those crackles out. I will say though that the nonpareil looking add ins fell out a bit, which isn't a big deal to me, they're just little add ins, but just a small note. Scent wise it is exactly what it says, a yummy juicy bartlett pear. It smells really refreshing, nice and simple. Almost reminded me of a soap, and I mean that as a compliment!

Tldr: Thick, bead-packed, a nice smallish level of resistance to help keep the structure, and super gummy and frothy. Whatever is different now, it's made Tori's bingsu jellies a new fav of mine! I noticed Tori is changing her jelly recipe again this restock Sunday so I'm looking forward to trying the new iteration next (though I will also miss this one too haha).

> Slime Name: Tropical Christmas

* Texture: Wood glue block bead slay

* Scent: pineapple dole whip, orange sherbet, mango sorbet, coconut milk

* Thoughts: First time trying this signature texture and I gotta say I get the hype. I played with the blockead topper by itself for a bit cause I liked it so much haha. Fingers crossed Tori makes a full cg blockbead someday cause it would be amazing. Anyway, once mixed the block beads just disappear into all that fluff from the slay haha. Not a bad thing, you feel them here and there, but they're cushioned well and add a nice feel to it. The clay in it gives it a little heft, and then the stretch is nice and just a tad resistant, which put together makes it satisfying to pull. There's just the right amount of structure to keep myself from getting consumed by all the fluff this thing turns into. It is indeed very creamy, and when inflated it feels like I'm plunging my hands into a big fluffy pillow. I inflated it so much it became hard to get the pops I heard these had lol. I still got them mind, but I did find it easier to make them when I split it into two. It just got that big and poofy! As for scent, it really does smell just like a tropical smoothie. It's a bit reminiscent of mango smoothie from the Coraline restock to me, but it's not as heavy on the cream side of the scent, which I like. It's a lot more balanced out with the fruits in my opinion.

Tldr: Overall a super addicting texture, so fluffy and pillowy, nice bit of resistance and heft, and inflates a tonnnn (I nearly filled a second 6 oz jar). Really fun to stretch and fluff up to squeeze. Nice pops but due to how much I inflated it first I found it easier to get them when working with half the amount, which just means I get to play with it twice lol.

> Slime Name: Sugar Plum Fairy

* Texture: White glue bingsu

* Scent: candied plums + pink sugar

* Thoughts: I love Tori's bingsus, so I already knew what to expect, and that I'd like it. The base on this one is on the average to thinner side, which seems standard for her wg bases, and I find it works really well with the bingsu it's packed with. It's got a great stretch with the perfect resistance, which imo really helps fluff it up for great big giant CRUNCHES. Nice and loud and plentiful, it's super addicting to fluff up and then squeeze the hell out of. There was some flecking with this, which I notice happens with Tori's wg bingsus, but again it's not the kind where it's flying everywhere. It is just some minor stuff hanging out on your hands, easy to pick back up while playing and very easy to manage. Doesn't detract at all for me. Also I gotta say the add ins for this were really pretty, I especially loved the thin little butterflies. As for scent, this was really pleasant. It's a nice balance of the fruity plum with the sugar. They blend to create this really tasty, almost juicy smelling sweet plum. Kinda reminds me of a really good fruity gum. Overall a super good combo and a nice expression of a sugar plum! 

Tldr: Really yummy scent in another great wg bingsu from Tori! Fluffs up great for lots of super LOUD crackles and crunches. Not sploopy, good structure, not much else to say, it does what a bingsu's supposed to do incredibly well!

> Slime Name: Mystery (freebie bonus for first 100 orders)

* Texture: ??? (feels like a slay with java chips)

* Scent: ??? (notes of chocolate and I think coffee? maybe a mocha or a chocolate chip cookie?)

* Thoughts: I made first 100 so this was my freebie, and oh my God what a surprise hit this was for me! Fun fact, I don't like a lot of gourmand scents. I'm super picky, and more often than not they make me gag than smell like what they're supposed to for me. This scent, though? This is downright mouthwatering. It is definitely chocolate, that's the main thing, but it also seems like there's coffee there as the second note. I'm wondering if it's just a super rich multi layered chocolate scent though and what I'm smelling is supposed to be more cookie oriented, like a decadent chocolate chip cookie. I say this because the fimo mix it came with was Santa faces, cookies (same as the ones in the snickerdoodle slime she had), and brown fragments clearly intended to look like chocolate chunks. And then the slime itself was a light tan (like the color of chocolate milk) with brown java chips in it. All together this makes me think this is supposed to be themed around Santa's cookies, hence the scent possibly being intended as chocolate chip cookies. But whatever it is I looooove it so much. It is very rare for me to get a slime that smells so good I wanna eat it but that is just what this did. I had to go make cookies after because I wanted some so bad lol. As for texture, I definitely think this is some kind of slay. It's not the same as the wood glue block bead one but it was still pretty similar so that was why I think so. Less heft (probably because less clay? maybe?), but still a similar level of resistance, stretch, etc. Super smooth with a little glossy sheen to it, gives some nice pops and snaps, and very fun to fluff up! Doesn't fluff like the block bead slay for comparison but it still did a good job! I got it to like 2/3 towards double, and it was just as fun to squeeze still. 

Tldr: The most delicious chocolate/chocolate cookie w/ coffee(?) scent I've ever smelled. A delightfully simple slay overall for texture, with a nice combo of occasional pops/snaps and a satisfying stretch. A real surprise fav of my order (even though as you can see I really did love them all)


And that's all I got! First time posting a review so sorry if it's not exactly good quality. I did my best with translating my thoughts to the page, which can be a challenge for me. As a final note, I do wanna say that when I put in my PSS order, I went back and got Mean One separately as a last minute extra (thank goodness I did too). I fully intended to ask for the orders to be combined, but I got busy and forgot. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw Tori did it for me anyway without my asking! It was a nice little extra touch of customer service, and I wanted to share what I saw as an example of extra effort from her.",3,1734242237.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

Goals are good but you only get 80 years and those financial goals kinda play out as such:  

Age 0-22: childhood and education. Your days feel complicated but they are the simplest they will ever be. The concept of financial milestones sprouts in your mind. 73% of life still to go.

Age 23-35ish: self-discovery and finding a place in a society. Early careers, dating, lots of adult firsts. Set and hit financial and personal milestones you really care about. They are often hugely linked to your identity and self worth. Plan and eager for more in future. 57% of life left. 

Age 36-49: You now have responsibly for others and start to see happiness and hardships of life. Caring for children and aging family. Dealing with semi-frequent friend/relatives deaths. Years are flying by at this point. Life has less fun but much more joy than any other time. You‚Äôre kinda getting this feeling that you care more about moments than milestones you are hitting almost by default. Only 39% of your life is in front of you. 

Age 50-65: You figured out that being a human is about moments and milestones were just mental gymnastics to materialize necessary planning for the middle 1/3 of life. The best part of your days is completely unrelated to any previous financial goalposts: talking to your kids, neighbors, friends, even strangers and personal routine like morning coffee and exercise. You really know what you enjoy now and it‚Äôs not the boat, car or vacation home. 18% left.

Age 66-80: No big purchases sound appealing, forgot what milestones you even had- was it ‚Äú1mm by age x or y?‚Äù, don‚Äôt care all about financials, 2mm and 20mm feel like identical numbers that you can‚Äôt trade for what you really want- a few more simple days.

1hem857,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1hem857/1_year_and_7_months_smokefree/,1 year and 7 months smokefree,"Hey there, 

Todays my 1 year and 7 months smoke free after having been a smoker for about 14 years. I‚Äôm 29 now, so most of my adult life I‚Äôve been a smoker. In the end I was at a pack a day and could never imagine myself not smoking. 

Quitting smoking was the hardest thing I ever did. The first 3 months were terrible and I don‚Äôt know how on earth I made it through this time. The only thing that kept me going was that I never ever wanted to go through any of it again. 
I never wanted to feel the first days of physical cravings again, have sleepless nights, being very sweaty and nervous with a constantly loud and fast beating heart. Never wanted to be this irritated and restless again, spending all my thoughts all day every day every second on if I should reeeally continue not smoking or just fuck it and relief myself. And I‚Äôd never want my brain to trick me again, thinking that smoking is so cool and mysterious and nonsmokers are just boring (?!?!). 
So, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: 
- first 3 months are the hardest, it‚Äôll get waaaay better after this. You just need to have done nearly everything you‚Äôve done while smoking without smoking 
- not kidding: I am not appealed by smoking anymore and find the idea of it disturbing. You‚Äôd need to pay me about 1 Million to make me smoke again  
- smoking is a strong form of conditioning (pavlovs dog) and you will be reminded of smoking for a long time through different activities. It is said that you need to do something as often without smoking as you did it with smoking to erase the bond in your brain. From my experience: I don‚Äôt think about smoking when drinking coffee anymore. In general I only crave cigs in extreme emotional situations, but it‚Äôs more a ‚ÄúI should go and smoke a cigarette‚Äù thought and never the craving for the cig itself 
- there is no sweeter feeling than telling doctors you‚Äôve quit smoking. I needed to get 2 operations last year and it felt so good telling the anaesthesiologist ü•π also: there is nothing more embarrassing than people smoking in the hospital. Need inspiration to quit? Hang out at a smokers spot at a hospital. 
- being able to quit smoking still makes me proud every day. I did it through solely will power and it makes me realise how much I can control and shift my mindset and my identity. Whenever I doubt myself I think of being able to quit smoking and my self confidence sky rockets immediately üòå
- for me there is no greater feeling than smelling my fingers and they - don‚Äôt smell?! üòÖ
- last thing: I still find myself really cool, even way cooler than I was as a smoker. I‚Äôm living the healthy life now and that is amazing.

Full house, we're sold out!

System goes down. For three fucking hours (BEB) (FUCK YOU BILTON) Attempts to check people in, situate rooms, and complaints and dirty rooms. Two youth soccer teams in house, ding dong ditching rooms, sprinting up and down the halls all night, parents drunk in the lobby, I am literally all alone. I get the parents to check their fucking kids or risk getting kicked out. Straighten out our housekeeping bullshit, listen to complaint after complaint after complaint about our breakfast, running out of food, coffee, shitty eggs and bizarre meat offerings. Chasing kids up and down the stairs. 

Finally 11 hits, I am tired, beat, ready to fucking go. 11:20 no one is here yet. Text the GC. ""I'm out of town, I requested off"" check the schedule. She's on for tn, but the schedule she has says she's off. AGM changed the schedule and didn't fucking tell anyone. ""All schedules are subject to change"" how in the fuck is my NA going to know if she's been off the whole goddamn week and you didn't text anyone Jack fucking shit? Her schedule shows her requested days off, she is out in fucking Tennessee!!! I text my other two NAs. One is out of town, the others phone is on DND. Fucking great. 

12 hits, my fiance texted me earlier saying she left her phone charger in my car so her phones dead. I can't have her up waiting for me to get home, she has work in the morning. So I run the charger to her, leave signs on the doors saying they're locked and I'll be back soon. Fuck this goddamn job man. I call my AGM. She hits decline. Over and over and over again. I know this because it rings a different amount each time. I check the schedule. She's requested off for this weekend. Fucking awesome. During a sold out weekend she takes off. Fuck me I guess. I call the only other fucking person I can, my maintenance guy. He says ""shit, I've never been in this situation, I really don't know what to tell you, you can call the GM but idk what she's gonna be able to do, you can try to call your AM person and see if she'll come in earlier to make it not so bad"" so I call her. She's also on DND. 

I cannot make this fucking shit up, I am livid. I want to just leave the keys on the fucking desk and say fuck it, but I can't. I have goddamn bills to pay. Bills that $13 an hour hardly fucking covers. I am beyond livid. I am beyond disappointed and disgusted. In the last month I have had 3 days off. Fucking THREE. I am here for whatever they need, yet no one is here for me. Never. Never not fucking once. I figure shit out on my own, if I have a problem, I know I can count on myself because I sure as fuck can't rely on my management to help me the fuck out. 

I can't afford to quit this job, so I'm going to stick it through. I have bills, I have to eat, I have my fiance relying on me to feed us. I have kittens that need to eat. Not kids, but I care about my cats deeply and I'll be goddamned if I'm not there for them when no one else was. Theyre strays, I couldn't watch them freeze and starve to death so I took them in, to my own detriment but whatever. I am ranting now,

**TL;DR:**  
Met a girl at a bar, spent an amazing 11 hours together talking and bonding. She mentioned wanting to take things slow but seemed interested. Her texts afterward felt less engaging, and now I‚Äôm unsure if she‚Äôs still interested. Wait a week or only one day for a second date?

I met this great girl in a bar, chatted to her after ""accidentally"" bumping into her. We were both there with our respective friend groups. Didnt think too much of it. She said yes. But after a while and a couple smiles she came over and let me know her and her friends would move to another bar as ours was closing. We went there with my friends and she didnt really glance in my direction there which I found very odd.  
My female friends said she wouldnt have invited me if she wasnt interested so while we were leaving I told her we would be grabbing a bite to eat and to come if she was hungry. She said she was starving and came with us. We ate, had a nice conversation and we sobered up quite a lot.  
Her friends were leaving the bar as well after we finished, I think she shared her location (understandable) but trusted me enough to walk her to her friends' home (as she was staying in a dorm). So while I'm walking her home she felt cold so I got a cab, dropped her off.  
As I'm paying she asks where my home is which was in the other part of the city. I hugged her and as I was walking, she asked me if I wanted to sleep in the guestroom as well because it was 4am already and freezing. I accepted.  
Her friend had a floorbed and made it for me. Well, we didnt sleep. We just talked. The whole night and morning.

In the morning she said she wasnt sleepy anymore and I walked her to her dorm. On the way there was a giant park, we went there and chatted by the lake and later lied down on the grass. For hours again.  
When I dropped her off at 3pm, she hugged me, two long hugs, which was nice. She said shed like to see me again but wanted to take things slow.  
In total we spent like 11 hours alone together. Also odd! But in a good way.  
I texted her afterwards after she woke up. About 5 minutes of texting about sleep and me complimenting her once which she sent a sticker to, which died the conversation down. Odd, right? Did she change her mind??

I can‚Äôt find a whole lot of specifics for deposit laws other than the only deductions are damages, missed rent, and cleaning.

Since I live here and the house is fully furnished the lease covers everything in the house and is more similar to like an Airbnb?

My roommate who moved out caused about a $1000 worth of damages from flushing something  down the toilet.  She denies it, so I can‚Äôt take it out of the deposit but it‚Äôs pretty clear it was her. Even the plumber said something about it. She also damaged multiple pots, broke several dishes, ruined towels, etc and all of this is mentioned in the lease as ‚Äúprovided furnishings‚Äù

This is context for why I don‚Äôt really want to cut her a break. 

Anyway the three big things that I‚Äôm trying to figure out are mold in the pantry, a coffee stains on the counter top and damage to a shower curtain.  

She spilled something in the pantry and must not have clean it up and it started growing mold. I can‚Äôt get it clean since it‚Äôs growing inside the wood.  I updated it not even a year ago.   Is it fair to charge her for the full replacement.  (Im seeing about $150 on average)  

She also spilled coffee on the white countertop on several occasions.  I usually caught it and got in cleaned up before it dried, but it happened once when I was out of town and it massively stained the counter top.  It‚Äôs only 4-5 years old.  Is it fair to charge her for this? If so how much? 

Then the shower curtain, I have no idea how she managed but it‚Äôs severely stained and also shank about 1.5 feet to the point where it‚Äôs no longer functional. I replaced it in June.  I wasn‚Äôt sure if this could be deducted since it‚Äôs not a major damage but since the lease mentioned all provided furnishings I thought maybe I could ($25) 

There also a pre-move out cleaning list in the lease (swiffer, wipe base boards, clean fan, clean windows, wipe out her space in the fridge, clean toilet/shower, etc) She didn‚Äôt do any of it and it took me a little over 2 hours to clean, is $25/hour so $50 fair for the cleaning?

1helxi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1helxi5/dating_question/,Dating question. ,"So I live in a small town and my boyfriend lives in the city, it‚Äôs about a 30-40 minute train journey when the trains run properly and usually we see each other on a Sunday reliably, there have been 1 or 2 occasions where we‚Äôve not seen each other either because of illness or the trains being canceled but generally Sundays are for sure. 

I work a Monday to Friday 9-5 is a fairly stressful job that‚Äôs been really difficult lately and I‚Äôve just been finding myself full of stress and anxiety and emotionally worn out. Everyday at work at the moment is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. 

He works shifts that are from 2pm - 11pm in a supermarket. 

So during the week if he‚Äôs working we can‚Äôt see each other and he often has to work Saturdays which means there not really viable either. 

Today it has ended up being that we can‚Äôt see each other because the trains are canceled and whilst there is some trains it‚Äôs not a for sure thing and I can‚Äôt get trapped in the city because I have work in the morning. 

There is the option of buses but it‚Äôs two buses each way and 1.5hours each way so 4 buses and 3 hours of travel. I just am not keen on that, it‚Äôs a lot. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt desperately want to see him but by the time the travels done and the specific times of the buses we would get very little time together because I want to be back in time to get ready for work and be in bed for a reasonable time. 

He has said that I seem ‚Äúcontent‚Äù to just spend 1 day a week together which couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. I just don‚Äôt see a viable way to spend more time together. 

I have offered to come through after work on the days he‚Äôs off but as I had already pointed out and what his response was was that by the time I get here we won‚Äôt have any decent time together. 

We‚Äôve slept together outside of marriage and I know what a sin that is so I‚Äôve said no to meeting at each others houses. It‚Äôs currently freezing weather and he can‚Äôt afford to go anywhere except coffee shops and they don‚Äôt open late at night so usually out time is cut short by about 7-7:30 at the latest because I don‚Äôt want to walk about in the cold. 


I just don‚Äôt like the assumption that I‚Äôm ‚Äúcontent‚Äù because I am anything but content. I am desperate for marrige and kids I‚Äôm going to be 30 this year and this relationship has reawakened by desire for all that stuff and it‚Äôs slowly killing me, the fact we‚Äôve messed about has caused me severe anxiety and I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs made me only further unclean and pushed me further from what I actually want. The only thing I have ever felt 100% strongly that God was calling me to do and that I would be fantastic at and is the place of my blessing is being a wife and a mother and it tears me up inside that I feel I‚Äôm nowhere near that. I don‚Äôt think I can say these things to him because it will come off as pressure. Make me look desperate. And I don‚Äôt want to push to that end, I want someone to want to marry me because they think I would make a good wife and be a fantastic mother. I try and be ok with the amount of time we spend together but I am desperately sad not to have more. We speak on the phone almost every night for 3-4hours most nights but it‚Äôs not the same as being in person. And I totally get that. I just can‚Äôt seem to make the time. And I feel like I have to keep reminding myself that we‚Äôre not married and so I have to still care for my own independent life because until I‚Äôm married it is only me who is responsible for my life, I can‚Äôt start letting that slip like we are married. 

I just feel really hurt at the statement that I‚Äôm ‚Äúcontent‚Äù with 1 day when it‚Äôs so far from the truth and my heart that it‚Äôs not even funny. 

Please, any advice or prayers would be very much appreciated.

Long story short, she reached out for some help with something for her business I had referred her too, and thought she was out 5k and got ripped off. I felt guilty and tried to track the money down, asked her to come over for wine, she countered with coffee. The group roasted me for it. 

We met, she admitted she still had feelings for me, ""lingering romantic ones"", and that the break up was hard, and she was still trying to process it and therapy was helping her to do so, along with xyz childhood, business issues. I took this as a green light to admit I still had the same feelings, and was interested in casually seeing each other and that I wasnt interested in getting back together immediately, but would entertain us taking our time with a view to repairing things in the future. Very quickly her language changed around how she felt and then it became ""feelings of romance and friendship"". And then when I asked for clarity, she further stressed that her romantic feelings for me I shouldn't ""get hung up on"", and our relationship ran its course. And then back to mixed signals. We talked for 2 hours and I learned alot about how much she felt for me during the relationship and all her hopes and dreams for us. I was getting mixed signals pretty soon with her language again, and decided to end the meet up on a high note, with no discussion for next steps, and at the end tried to kiss her and got denied. Oddly, I wasnt embarrassed and I'm not ashamed. And I don't regret meeting for coffee or attempting to kiss a woman I dated for two years, as recently as September and was in no contact with. Hilariously, I was kissing another woman the night before on a date who was open and willing to hook up. And even more hilariously this whole shit show made me realize this isn't the woman for me. 

So, what are the lessons I learned here so you guys don't make the mistake I did IF you want your ex back? Or IF you just want closure? This is stream of thought so please forgive me-

-corey is right, sometimes we want women back because we were rejected originally. Note, two things at play here, I literally thought daily about dumping her during the end of the relationship, I was unhappy. I literally woke up at 3 am three weeks before the break up and told her I wasnt happy. Secondly, I haven't met someone better, even though I've been dating. This made me more open to revisiting us and more nostalgic. And her telling me she was in therapy made me think she could fix the issues that plagued us because she referenced them specifically. A toxic and potent mix of hopium. Especially since she all but admitted our relationship ending was one of the reasons she went to therapy. 

-don't meet for coffee if you want her back. But meet for coffee if you want closure. She told me things I never realized she thought and felt about me that were bittersweet. How she knew she made mistakes with me, how she knew she needed to communicate more with me. How she thought about reaching out to me and sending me funny things or talking to me again during no contact. How when we were together she imagined us moving to my neighborhood together- all things she NEVER communicated to me. She even admitted I was one of the only two men she ever loved by her mid to late 30's, and the only one she said it too. But even that can't fix what's broken.

- Further, corey is right again, date women who are ""open, loving, and good communicators"". You see, she wasnt very loving, or a good communicator, and it was impossible for me to open her up when she literally never hinted to me how she felt and acted like everything is fine. I know corey has the relationship check up technique, but for women who are bad communicators, using this like I attempted, won't work. Women who bury things and are conflict adverse won't tell you. They just hope things will get better. There's a reason she's in therapy lol and again, I thought the combo of her reaching out and being in therapy could fix shit. 

- I lost my center the first time she admits she still has feelings for me over coffee via ""lingering romantic feelings"". I got fucking head faked and fell right over. For the first 20 minutes she was crying talking about our past, I held out for shorter than a Saturday morning cartoon, I couldn't even make the third commercial break lol Don't give up the ghost the first time your ex brings up her feelings for you. Looking back, it's now obvious she wasnt sharing all this stuff with me because she wanted me to admit the same, she needed to share it for herself. The minute I admitted I felt the same, she pulled back, and then mixed signals, and then pulled back even more. Every other time an ex has done this and I returned the feelings at the same level, we started hanging out again and dating. In this case, it backfired. Hold your cards close to your chest until she has to reveal not only her feelings for you, but what she wants from you too!

-careful misreading shit. You can see I did all through this post and the one before. Her talking about our past. Talking about lingering romantic feelings. How her family loves me and how she asks them about me (her dad calls me often to talk shop). How she thought of reaching out to me. How she made mistakes in our relationship. How good I looked and all the weight I lost. How she can't watch my insta stories because ""it would trigger her and might trigger me"". On and on and on I misread shit. So much so I think I either lost the ability to read women (which I could do fairly well with other exs, hence why I matched her language, because it worked before), or more likely, I ran into one that is just completely fucked up. Lol corey says you can't make wine out of bad grapes, I always took that as women who were dishonest or low class. I now will add in women that have emotional issues that pre date me. Lol

- no matter what, fellas, sometimes the universe keeps tapping us on the shoulder and throwing shit our way so we learn a lesson. I learned two big ones- she's an ex for a reason, and don't entertain broken relationships no matter how much you loves them. Let the attachment go. These are all chapters. Don't reread one and magically think because the book cover changed or the ink is a different color the characters will act differently.

-no contact works. Telling her not to reach out unless she wants something romantic also works. She came back 3 months later. But if you don't stick to the gameplan of drinks and your place, you are seriously risking your ability to re-attract her back. I crumbled the minute she responded with coffee instead. So if you want her back, stick to the 7 principles. But dude, you don't want her back. You want the twisted version of her back that you imagined she could be (in my case therapy would make her better, eventually). If you want closure, meet her for coffee. If you want something better, move on. Date new women. And expect it to take a while to meet one you really like emotionally. I'm still waiting lol and for gods sake don't let time work in HER favor by you romancing your past with her. 

-pay attention to her relationships with her ex's. She had a few that she didnt meet up with, she talked fondly of, and once in a blue moon talked too (she always told me), and always maintained she had no feelings for but we're important parts of her life in the past. I am now one of those ex's. I now suspect that she had feelings for those guys like she has ""lingering romantic feelings for me"", and liked to keep them around through light contact. Because thats what she wants for us. And now I understand why one in particular she always went for business advice too. I'm now the new replacement for him lol. 

Finally, I texted her about an hour after the meet up. I told her I wasn't embarrassed about trying to kiss her, I stand by the attempt and stand by how I felt about her at that moment. Had to regain some self respect lol. I also told her she's free to reach out with memes and funny stories like she had said she wanted too. Why?  Because we arent getting  back together and no ex back strategy is going to make it happen (now). Because no amount of charm, charisma, and nostalgia is going to rebuild something broken she doesn't want to rebuild. And something I now realize shouldn't be rebuilt. I'm friendly with a few other exs. She will now be one of them. ",2,1734240468.0,CoreyWayne,2,1.0,False

i (F) grew up with my father who stopped at nothing to get into business. during his upbringing i was really young so i kinda got harmlessly dragged into it at first. my whole childhood was dedicated to feeding me knowledge so i could be his business partner, but we never had a real relationship or anything. i spoke better english than he did and it led to me being his lifeline. the issue is that i wasn‚Äôt entitled to anything at all if i didn‚Äôt work for it. i didn‚Äôt even deserve food, water or clothes if i didn‚Äôt work enough for it and everything was constantly an argument of if ive been loyal enough to deserve basic necessities. it didn‚Äôt matter if i pulled all nighters with school or if i was sick. which leads me to my next point-

i fell ill when i was a kid and having money and freedom, a lot of people wanted to be friends with me. i didn‚Äôt understand at the time why they did, just thought they thought i was funny. but when i fell ill and stopped working literally everyone was gone within a month. everyone just stuck with me for free drinks, parties and day trips. no one actually cared about me. 

my parents did everything they could to keep me as close to them just for the benefit of making money. i came across text referring to me as a ‚Äúcute little puppy‚Äù and saying my only purpose was to please investors with scummy tactics. i didn‚Äôt want to be used anymore and i had other life plans so i cut ties with business. i had no desire to only strive for being as rich as possible. 

i don‚Äôt feel like ive met anyone who puts me over money. i dont have a negative relationship with money. i just kind of feel like its important in life but its not enough for me to hold it so far above people or to keep every dime i have to myself and not spend anything on anyone. in relationships all i see is people either wanting money from others or they think youre not entitled to their assets whatsoever. ive talked to guys who think girls who want birthday gifts are gold diggers. in my last relationship, i was called greedy because i wanted a birthday gift and cried because no one is ever willing to treat me. i had to buy my own birthday dinner, birthday presents and went out on my own. when i cried he told me ‚Äúat least you got something for your birthday‚Äù from myself‚Ä¶. yes. 

id give anything to be spoiled for once. my whole existence has always revolved around greed and ive never had anyone even treat me to a coffee. ive spent so much on the people i love and i genuinely just want to feel like i have more worth than a $5 bill or the newest video game. 

i have no friends, no family and no life over greed and i really wish people would be friends with me or date me without money either single handedly forming our relationship or greed single handedly destroying our relationship. ",1,1734240275.0,lonely,5,0.67,False

This year I spent a few months in Rio de Janeiro staying in Ipanema, working & enjoying Carnival, and wanted to share what I learnt from living in Brazil for the first time.

For context, I‚Äôm 36 years old, digital nomad for 10 years: former web designer but now YouTuber about our lifestyle.

**Pros**:

* Active life. The whole area from Leblon to Copacabana is surrounded by beach, and there‚Äôs so many sport activities to enjoy: outdoor gym, yoga sessions, surf, paddling, beach volleyball, padel and of course, tons of football. Even the bus stop have a calisthenic add-on, isn‚Äôt that cool? It‚Äôs true that everyone seems to be fit here‚Ä¶
* DN Community. I was surprised to find a big community in Rio, there‚Äôs dinners, meetups and parties thrown every week to connect with other remote workers. Almost every coffee shop I went there‚Äôs one person working on their laptop.
* Music. Rio, or Brazil even, it‚Äôs just so lively with all the music going around. In Copacabana you can listen the original Bossa nova or listen to live music in small rooms. Also on the beach there‚Äôs always someone playing music. Personally it‚Äôs what really made me enjoy the city.
* Carnival, this could be a con if you don‚Äôt like to party because this event goes for a whole month lol ‚Äîsome events even starts at 7am. Rio becomes a party city, lots of people out and about enjoying music and life.

**Cons:**

* Safety. It does take some time to get used to the city, as yes theft can happen or you see homeless even in Ipanema. You should definitely be more aware than other places.
* Overpriced accommodation. Ipanema & Leblon are my favorite areas to stay, but unfortunately bookings are a bit overpriced, it‚Äôs hard to find quality places with the right price. I ended up paying 2K per month, by person, also because january and february is high season.

Overall I loved my experience in Rio, that I would definitely go back in a heartbeat for next year as carnival is coming back again and there‚Äôs so much music, fun and activities to do.

I also made a [full video of the experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVT6tlYbXWo), 40 mins long, if you are interested!

I have all of her perfumes, my favorite being the OG Sweet Tooth. I love gourmand and floral perfumes‚Ä¶really I like all kinds is fragrance styles. Except I typically hate coffee scents. They usually smell like mothballs on me but I took a chance with this one!

I will be honest and say I‚Äôm not a huge fan of her cherry perfume. Maybe it‚Äôs the chocolate note? Or it could be the medicinal smell when you first spray it. Though when it dries down it improves a ton!! 

Now for Me Espresso! When I first sprayed it all I could smell was coffee with a hint of vanilla. And it wasn‚Äôt artificial coffee but legit did I just spill coffee on my pajamas smell. But the dry down surprised the heck out of me. It‚Äôs powdery and floral but not a floral I‚Äôve ever smelled before. Almost a candy floral? Makes me think of these lavender mints and gum I used to get when I was a teen. If you have smelled Bath and Body Works Petal Parade then that‚Äôs the track I‚Äôm riding right now. Which I love that spray so that connection makes sense! Either way I love it and Petal Parade is the closest thing g in my collection that I have that is vaguely similar to it. I have about 15 perfumes and 20 body mists and this will be a unique addition to my collection. 

I also want to note that as much I love Sweet Tooth, this is the strongest smelling out of all her fragrances. In the OGs, I usually have to spray like 10x for strength purposes but with this one I can smell it for days with one spray.

- Your teeth may be sensitive for a short period, especially to hot or cold substances.
- It is advisable to avoid certain foods and drinks, like coffee or red wine, for 24-48 hours, as the enamel may be porous and vulnerable to staining.

</div>Exploring Different Teeth Whitening Methods and Their Impact on Your Smile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a bright, white smile can significantly boost your confidence and improve your overall appearance. Teeth whitening has become one of the most popular cosmetic dental procedures, and many people are interested in the various methods available. Each method comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, and understanding them can help you choose the best option for you.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several teeth whitening methods to consider. Here are some of the most popular options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves a dental professional applying a concentrated whitening gel to your teeth. The process typically takes about an hour, and you‚Äôll see immediate results.
- **At-Home Kits:** Your dentist may provide custom whitening trays and gel to use at home. These kits take longer to show results, usually a few days to weeks, but can be very effective.
- **Whitening Strips:** Over-the-counter whitening strips are easy to use and can yield noticeable results; however, they may not be as effective as professional treatments.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** This is a more gradual whitening method that helps remove surface stains. It is less dramatic than other options but safe for daily use.
- **Natural Remedies:** Baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and even charcoal are sometimes used for natural whitening. However, results vary and may not be as effective or safe for long-term use.

### In-Office Whitening Impact

In-office teeth whitening is often favored for its quick and professional results. The treatment uses strong bleaching agents and specialized lights to maximize effect. Many people who undergo this procedure report that their teeth can become several shades lighter in just one visit. It‚Äôs also a safe method, handled by trained professionals who ensure minimal gum irritation.

### At-Home Whitening Kits

If you prefer a more gradual approach, at-home whitening kits might be your best choice. With custom trays tailored to your teeth, you will apply the whitening gel comfortably. Although it might take more time‚Äîoften up to two weeks‚Äîyou have the flexibility to whiten your teeth at your convenience. Users commonly report satisfaction with the results after consistent use, allowing for a gradually enhanced smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Whitening Strips and Toothpaste

Whitening strips are a favorite for many because of their convenience. They typically require wearing the strips for 30 minutes a day for about a week. While results may not be as dramatic as professional methods, many users appreciate the effectiveness for touch-ups. Whitening toothpaste, on the other hand, is perfect for maintenance. It focuses on polishing teeth and preventing stains, though it will not drastically change the color of your teeth.

### Natural Remedies

Natural teeth whitening methods are on the rise as people seek more organic solutions. Ingredients like baking soda can gently scrub away stains, while hydrogen peroxide acts as a mild bleaching agent. However, the results may be subtle, and it's essential to use caution to avoid enamel damage. Always consult with a dental professional before trying these methods, as safety is crucial in maintaining your oral health.

### Evaluating Results

When considering teeth whitening methods, it's essential to reflect on the expected results. For instance, in-office treatments offer quick, noticeable effects, while at-home kits provide gradual improvement. Realistic expectations are key. Many find that after their whitening journey, they not only enjoy a brighter smile but also greater confidence in social interactions.

### Maintaining Your Whiter Smile

After whitening your teeth, maintaining that bright appearance is vital. Here are some tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Avoid dark-colored foods and drinks like coffee, red wine, and certain berries.
- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
- Use a straw to minimize contact with beverages that may stain your teeth.
- Visit your dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanses.

Understanding the various teeth whitening methods can empower you to make an informed decision tailored to your needs. With the right approach, you can achieve that bright smile you‚Äôve always wanted and feel confident showing it off to the world.

### Conclusion

The journey to a brighter, more confident smile through teeth whitening reveals striking transformations that often exceed expectations.

I understand that because I sometimes cringe from loud noises and prefer a narrow regimen of food, and because my social skills aren‚Äôt superb‚Äîand also because I chose to go into a niche field‚ÄîI am not the ideal daughter to my parents, and that I‚Äôll frequently let them down. However, I‚Äôm increasingly feeling like their treatment of me is inordinately cruel.

My mother is, in my opinion, a control freak. She and my father make constant ‚Äòmicrocriticisms ‚Äò of me, derisively critiquing things like the angle of my pillow against my headboard, what and how much I eat, how loud I drink water, how loud I laugh, what and how much I sleep (I‚Äôm not allowed to ‚Äòsleep during the day,‚Äô even though I struggle with intense fatigue and I‚Äôm not allowed to drink coffee either), how I ‚Äúmove‚Äù (not really sure how to fix this one), how I hold my fork, whether the blinds in my bedroom are open or shut (I have to keep them open though I prefer dim light), how many vitamins I take (my mother insists I take five supplements daily even though they have not been prescribed and even though I‚Äôve told her they make me feel ill). Sometimes when I express that I am fatigued, I will receive a look of (what I perceive as) absolutely insane rage and disgust and also the silent treatment. The other day I was sick and coughing up mild amounts of blood but my mother showed barely any concern. She freaks out when I have acne, though, and says i ‚Äúused to be so pretty.‚Äù (She demands I put unpleasant products on my face even though DOCTORS have said the acne is stress related). Recently my mother got mad at me for asking her to help me carry groceries in. I am repeatedly castigated for being sensitive and ‚Äúirresponsible,‚Äù and my parents have repeatedly implied or even said that I am not capable of being normal or living on my own. They often list reasons why ‚Äúpeople won‚Äôt like you,‚Äù and say things like ‚Äúpeople won‚Äôt like you unless you [do specific minor thing I want you to do].‚Äù 

I feel like I am losing my mind. I feel so unsafe and dread seeing, hearing, or conversing with my parents. I try to stay away from them all day. But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being too sensitive‚Äîif I really do ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô this admittedly-unusual treatment because I‚Äôm autistic, and I know they truly are trying altruistically to make me normal and liked. They‚Äôre always saying it comes from a place of love, and I know it does, but I can never relax.

I want to move out, but I‚Äôll be unemployed. Please tell me I‚Äôm not crazy? They often tell me  softly that I‚Äôm misremembering things I know fucking happened, and that happening so repeatedly is making me lose my grip on my own sense of my past. (I know what this behavior is called, but the word has been so bastardized, lol. ALSO, I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs not on purpose, and that they genuinely don‚Äôt recall the events I describe). AIO? I think I‚Äôm not, but I‚Äôm autistic. ",0,1734239972.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

1heljn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1heljn6/who_is_gman_and_whats_his_motive_a_theory/,Who is G-Man and what‚Äôs his motive? A Theory,"This is basically my first attempt any game theory. And I'm not entirely familiar with all of the half-life universe lore. Please if you have any defying evidence or supporting one, I'd be thrilled to hear them!

Who is Gman?

G-Man isn‚Äôt a person. He‚Äôs an avatar for a collective, interdimensional intelligence or organization. His awkward cadence and clipped speech? Not quirks. They‚Äôre the result of him being a mouthpiece for an entity that doesn‚Äôt fully grasp human communication but uses it because it‚Äôs ‚Äúefficient enough.‚Äù

The organization G-Man works for? **The Employers**, since he‚Äôs always referring to his higher-ups. They‚Äôre essentially an interdimensional cartel that specializes in **controlling chaos across multiverses**. Conflicts like the Combine‚Äôs invasion aren‚Äôt just planetary issues, they‚Äôre multiversal instability events. The Employers‚Äô goal isn‚Äôt to stop these conflicts out of altruism, it‚Äôs about ensuring their own dominance by keeping the balance intact.

Gman's role as a recruiter.

Gman is tasked to recruit so called ""Extraordinary individuals"" that can nudge the future in certain direction in interest of his Employers. But his choice for Gordon Freeman is somewhat strange. Since Adrian Shephard was also in the potential choice. Given Adrian's military background why would Gman choose a theoretical physicist instead of a trained soldier?

# Why Not Adrian Shephard?

Given Adrian Shephard‚Äôs military background and combat skills, he seems like the obvious choice for G-Man‚Äôs tasks. But Shephard‚Äôs military indoctrination is precisely why G-Man didn‚Äôt choose him. Shephard would be too loyal to the Employers‚Äô rigid, structured way of thinking. Since in a way he'd probably believe that the Gman and by extension his Employers are helping to free earth from the combine. G-Man needs someone who operates outside the system or someone chaotic.

Enter Gordon Freeman. As a theoretical physicist, Freeman doesn‚Äôt carry the weight of military or corporate loyalty. He‚Äôs not tied to any agenda. G-Man doesn‚Äôt need a soldier who follows orders; he needs a disruptor. Freeman‚Äôs unpredictability makes him the perfect wild card. Someone who can wreak havoc on the Combine without falling in line with any side.

# The Combine as Entropy

The Combine isn‚Äôt just a totalitarian regime, they‚Äôre the embodiment of entropy. They represent the universal tendency toward uniformity, where distinct systems collapse into a single homogenized state. Entropy is like the tendency of systems to go from an ordered, defined, structured sort of state (like the moment when you first pour milk into coffee) to a more uniform state, equilibrium (like when the milk has fully dispersed through the coffee). Their goal assimilating everything into one entity isn‚Äôt just conquest. It‚Äôs the ultimate heat death of individuality.

The Employers, while seemingly opposed to the Combine, share a similar goal. They want multiversal domination, albeit in a different form, a tightly controlled balance where they pull the strings. This sets up a philosophical clash between two forms of collectivism. And G-Man? He‚Äôs caught in the middle.

# G-Man‚Äôs Real Motive

Here‚Äôs where it gets spicy: G-Man‚Äôs primary motive isn‚Äôt saving humanity or even opposing the Combine. His goal is **freedom**. And not just freedom for Earth or Gordon Freeman, it's freedom for himself.

While G-Man appears to recruit individuals who serve the Employers‚Äô interests, his choices often raise eyebrows. Gordon Freeman, for example, isn‚Äôt the most obedient or obvious candidate. But that‚Äôs the point. Freeman is just chaotic enough to disrupt the system while being controllable enough to appear useful to the Employers. By picking Freeman over someone like Shephard, G-Man manipulates his Employers into thinking he‚Äôs serving them when, in reality, he‚Äôs undermining both sides.

# G-Man‚Äôs Gamble

G-Man‚Äôs plan is a massive gamble. By destabilizing the Combine, he risks tipping the multiverse into chaos. But that chaos is exactly what he needs to slip out of his leash. Without the Combine‚Äôs empire and the Employers‚Äô tight grip, G-Man can carve out his own existence as a free agent.

This aligns with his line in Half-Life 2: Episode Two when he speaks about Alyx:

>When I plucked her from Black Mesa, I acted in the face of objections, that she was a mere child, and of no practical use to anyone. I have since learned to ignore such naysayers, when... Quelling them, hm? Was out of the question. I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain... restrictions, hm?

This suggests that while G-Man works under the Employers, he has some degree of autonomy. He‚Äôs playing the long game, carefully choosing individuals who will both appear useful and further his hidden agenda.

# Individualism vs. Collectivism

At its core, Half-Life is a battle between individualism and collectivism. The Combine seeks total assimilation, the Employers enforce rigid control. G-Man, while not entirely altruistic, represents a third path: the chaotic middle ground where freedom, however messy it becomes possible.

By nudging Freeman into the Combine‚Äôs path, G-Man sets the stage for a multiversal rebellion. Whether he‚Äôs a tragic anti-hero or a manipulative opportunist, one thing‚Äôs clear: G-Man‚Äôs endgame isn‚Äôt just about humanity or the Combine. It‚Äôs about carving out a space where he and perhaps others can finally be free.

TL;DR:  G-Man isn‚Äôt just a person he‚Äôs an avatar for a collective, interdimensional intelligence (The Employers), tasked with managing chaos across multiverses. The Combine represents entropy, seeking to assimilate everything, while the Employers aim for domination through rigid control. Gman, however, secretly desires freedom for himself.

G-Man‚Äôs true goal involves destabilizing both the Combine and the Employers by using Gordon Freeman, a wildcard disruptor, to create chaos. Unlike Adrian Shephard, Freeman‚Äôs lack of military loyalty makes him the perfect candidate to wreak havoc without aligning with anyone.

Ultimately, G-Man‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt saving humanity, it‚Äôs escaping his own leash and carving out his own existence in multiversal anarchy.",2,1734239364.0,HalfLife,0,1.0,False

1helelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/1helelt/so_depressed_i_wish_it_would_end/,So depressed I wish it would end,"I lowered my mood stabilizer slightly in July.

I immediately fell into an intense depression.  I battled it for months.  I would rise out of it then fall back down.

After about 6 months finally I felt happy and like my old self for the first time.  I was enjoying life again.

A few months ago I met a really amazing woman and I was slowly becoming friends with her.

I never got the impression she was interested in dating me.  I honestly wasn't thinking anything like that when I became friends with her.  I was just enjoying talking to her.

In the last few weeks I started to like her.  I was thinking about her a lot.

Then I saw her and had a good time, but she left with a guy and I think she has a boyfriend.

Which is not surprising to me at all.  I didn't expect anything.

But I all of a sudden got incredibly depressed when I realized it. I went home and really wished I was dead.

It's been a couple days now and I've been fairly rapidly cycling around.  When I wake up I feel okay.  Then I have my coffee and get up.  But eventually I crash and get horribly depressed again.

Then I have my second coffee of the day.  Rise up out of it.  Then eventually crash and get horribly depressed again.

I really really wish I was dead.  I feel totally hopeless and sad.  

It's... I guess disguising itself as being about the woman.  But it's really not.  

I had a huge crush on one my friends for like 18 months until about a month ago.  But she's never gonna be with me.  And it would honestly be awful if I did get in a relationship with her.  She's... extremely difficult. Undiagnosed mental illness. 

When I got off benzos I had to spend years learning to cope with anxiety again. I eventually did.  But not before I went completely and extremely psychotic.

I feel like this is one of those situations.  Where I'm gonna have to learn to deal with depression intensely.  But I'm still on Lamictal.  It's not like I'm off the drug. I feel like I may as well raise it back up.

But I also don't know if it's entirely medication related.

It's also winter. Winter makes me horribly depressed.  But it shouldn't be this bad.

I feel like if I can learn to deal with this I'll be better off.

I used to get so manic it felt like I was stoned and would have panic attacks.  That doesn't happen anymore. 

But my lows are lower.  My highs are lower.  But my lows are lower.

I don't know.  But I'm tired of feeling like I absolutely wish I was dead.",2,1734238843.0,schizoaffective,3,1.0,False

1hele54,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransMasc/comments/1hele54/getting_much_weirder_interactions_since_my_voice/,Getting much weirder interactions since my voice dropped,"I am a gay binary trans man. My voice has had two drops so far, and at this point I 100% pass as male if someone hears my voice.

But if they hear my voice AND see me, a lot of people now seem weirded out and hesitant to gender me one way or the other.

I am aware that I do have some very androgynous style choices. I have a few facial piercings, although the jewelry I wear isn't feminine. I also have a gender neutral haircut (slicked back mohawk with shaved temples). I am clean chaven bc my beard is too patchy rn.

My face has also changed and become more masculine, it's leaned out a lot.

I'm genuinely at a loss as to what's changed to make people suddenly be unsure about what to gender me as. But I think that's just me not really understanding how small changes for me, can have big impacts on people's perceptions. I got gendered as a guy consistently for about the past 4-6 months (been on T 9 months), up until my second voice drop this month.

I think at this point a few people may be thinking that I'm transfem due to my deep voice, or just genuinely can't tell my gender. I have had a new coworker think I was transfem. I do know for a fact that I look a bit ""stereotypically"" gay now too. We get a lot of gay customers at work (we're a metro area coffee shop, and it's to the point where we've caught guys hooking up in our bathrooms several times lol), and I get checked out by guy customers a loooot more than I used to. So I guess it could be a mix of being possibly seen as transfem by some, and getting clocked as gay by others?

I'm trying not to worry about it too much. I have a coworker who's a twink and that man gets misgendered on the daily, simply bc he's petite and feminine. So I know a lot of it is just cis people doing their thing and being blind as hell most of the time. But still, it's been exhausting adjusting to a big increase in weird/judgmental looks lately. Boomer male customers are the worst offenders for being rude to me now, which I'm really not surprised by üòÖ

1heldpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1heldpt/take_control_of_your_wellbeing_with_online/,Take Control of Your Well-Being with Online Counseling,"In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, where stress and anxiety are prevalent, taking care of your mental health has never been more important. Traditionally, counseling was seen as something that required you to physically visit a therapist or counselor. However, with the rise of online counseling, taking control of your well-being has become easier, more accessible, and often more affordable. Whether you're struggling with stress, anxiety, relationship issues, or just need someone to talk to, online counseling offers a variety of benefits that make mental health support more convenient and flexible.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore the numerous advantages of online counseling, how it works, who it‚Äôs for, and why it can be a transformative experience for anyone seeking to improve their mental well-being. Let‚Äôs dive into why you should consider taking control of your mental health through online counseling.

# 1. The Convenience of Online Counseling

# Access From Anywhere, Anytime

One of the most compelling reasons to consider online counseling is the convenience it offers. With just an internet connection, you can access professional therapy from the comfort of your own home, or even while traveling. This eliminates the need to commute, take time off work, or worry about finding a therapist in your area. For many people, scheduling an appointment is as simple as logging into a secure online platform.

Whether you're in a rural area with limited access to in-person therapists or living in a busy city where your time is stretched thin, online counseling can be tailored to fit your lifestyle. You can schedule sessions at times that are convenient for you, even outside of normal office hours. This flexibility ensures that counseling is not an added stressor in your life, but rather a supportive resource that works around your schedule.

# Anonymity and Comfort

For some individuals, the thought of speaking to a therapist face-to-face can be intimidating. Whether due to anxiety, shyness, or cultural barriers, many people find it difficult to express themselves openly in an in-person setting. Online counseling helps alleviate these fears by offering a level of anonymity and privacy that can make individuals feel more comfortable.

In an online environment, you have control over the setting. You can engage in therapy sessions in a familiar and comfortable space‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs in your living room, at a coffee shop, or even in your car. This setting can make it easier to open up and discuss personal issues without fear of judgment.

# 2. Cost-Effectiveness of Online Counseling

# Affordable Therapy

While traditional face-to-face therapy can be costly, online counseling often provides a more affordable alternative. Many online platforms offer sliding scale fees, packages, or subscriptions that can make counseling more financially accessible. This affordability makes it an excellent option for individuals who may not have insurance or whose insurance doesn‚Äôt cover mental health services adequately.

Additionally, with online counseling, you eliminate transportation costs and time spent off work, which often translates to even greater savings. The financial flexibility offered by online counseling helps make mental health services more accessible to a wider population.

# Value for Money

Online therapy also provides great value for money by allowing you to select the kind of therapy that best suits your needs. Whether you're looking for text-based sessions, video calls, or audio counseling, there‚Äôs a variety of options available to meet different preferences and budgets. For those who prefer more frequent or shorter sessions, many online platforms make it easier to connect with therapists on a weekly or even daily basis.

The ability to have more frequent sessions at an affordable rate means that you can receive continuous support and make more progress toward your mental health goals. In contrast, traditional therapy might require long waits between appointments, leading to delays in progress.

# 3. Online Counseling is Just as Effective as In-Person Therapy

# Research-Backed Effectiveness

Many people wonder whether online counseling can be as effective as face-to-face therapy. The short answer is yes‚Äîstudies have shown that online therapy can be just as effective as in-person sessions. Research indicates that online counseling is beneficial for treating a variety of conditions, including anxiety, depression, relationship problems, and grief.

In fact, some studies suggest that online therapy may even help clients open up more readily due to the relaxed and non-threatening environment it provides. The digital space can help individuals who are otherwise reluctant to seek help take that first crucial step toward healing. This has been especially significant for individuals suffering from social anxiety or agoraphobia, where in-person visits can be overwhelming.

# Therapist Qualifications and Training

Online counselors are licensed professionals who adhere to the same standards as in-person therapists. They are trained to use digital communication tools effectively and are often highly skilled in working with remote clients. This ensures that the quality of care you receive through online counseling is just as high as if you were meeting with a therapist in their office.

Additionally, many online counselors specialize in specific therapeutic methods, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), or trauma-informed therapy. This allows clients to choose therapists who are best suited to their individual needs, further enhancing the effectiveness of their treatment.

# 4. Flexibility and Customization of Online Counseling

# Variety of Formats

Online counseling offers various formats, making it easier to find a method that works for you. Whether you prefer video calls, voice calls, or even just chatting through text-based therapy, there are options to fit different comfort levels. Some people may not feel comfortable with video calls but find that text-based sessions or voice calls allow them to express themselves more freely.

The flexibility in communication formats also helps individuals maintain consistency in therapy, even when they‚Äôre traveling or dealing with other logistical challenges. The choice to switch between mediums throughout the course of your treatment can also provide variety, keeping sessions fresh and engaging.

# Tailored to Your Needs

Online counseling offers the opportunity to choose therapists based on their specialties and your needs. Whether you're dealing with anxiety, depression, addiction, relationship issues, or trauma, you can easily find a therapist who has experience in that particular area. This level of customization helps ensure that your therapy is targeted and specific to your goals.

Moreover, online counseling allows you to choose how often you want to meet with your therapist. Whether you need weekly check-ins, bi-weekly sessions, or even just occasional support, the flexibility allows you to find the right rhythm for your personal progress.

# 5. A Wider Range of Therapeutic Approaches

# Specialized Therapy Options

Online counseling can connect you with a wider variety of therapy approaches and techniques than you might find locally. Whether you're interested in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based therapy, solution-focused therapy, or any number of other approaches, online platforms offer access to therapists who specialize in these areas.

This variety means that you can experiment with different types of therapy to find the best fit for your personality and the issues you're dealing with. Additionally, online platforms can offer access to various therapeutic techniques, such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) for trauma or art therapy for self-expression. Having this range of options allows you to explore what works best for you.

# International Access

Online counseling also opens the door to therapists from around the world. This can be beneficial for individuals who may feel more comfortable with therapists from different cultural backgrounds or those who speak a specific language. In some cases, individuals may also prefer to work with therapists who specialize in cross-cultural issues or who understand the challenges they may face based on their geographical or social context.

This global reach provides you with a diverse range of therapy styles, perspectives, and methodologies that you might not find in your local area.

# 6. Privacy and Confidentiality

# Secure Platforms

Privacy is often a concern when seeking counseling, but online counseling platforms take confidentiality very seriously. Most platforms use secure, encrypted communication channels to ensure that your sessions are private and protected. They also comply with strict data protection laws, such as HIPAA in the U.S. or GDPR in the EU, ensuring that your personal information is safe.

For individuals who value privacy and discretion, online counseling provides an extra layer of protection compared to traditional therapy, where there may be concerns about running into someone they know in the therapist's waiting room or during public interactions.

# Avoiding Stigma

Mental health stigma can be a barrier to seeking help, especially in communities where therapy is seen as a sign of weakness. Online counseling helps individuals bypass this stigma by allowing them to engage in therapy from a private location. This can empower people who might otherwise avoid seeking help due to fear of judgment.

By seeking therapy from the privacy of your home, you can start your healing journey without worrying about the social stigma that sometimes surrounds mental health treatment. This can make it easier to commit to your therapy and take the necessary steps toward improving your well-being.

# 7. Overcoming Mental Health Barriers with Online Counseling

# Breaking Down Barriers to Access

Mental health issues often carry a significant stigma, especially in societies where seeking therapy is still considered taboo. Many people are hesitant to admit they need help due to fear of judgment, misunderstanding, or feeling weak. However, the anonymity and privacy offered by online counseling can break down these barriers, making it easier for individuals to seek help without the fear of social stigma.

For those who feel socially isolated or fear being judged by others for seeking therapy, online counseling offers a safe and welcoming environment. This sense of security can be the catalyst that encourages individuals to take the first step toward healing.

Furthermore, for people with certain mental health conditions such as social anxiety or agoraphobia, leaving the house to attend in-person sessions can feel overwhelming. Online counseling provides a way for these individuals to receive the support they need without stepping out of their comfort zones. This can make all the difference in their willingness to engage in therapy and their long-term commitment to improving their mental health.

# Overcoming Physical Limitations

Physical limitations can also prevent individuals from accessing in-person therapy. Those who are elderly, disabled, or living with chronic health conditions may find it difficult to leave their homes for therapy. Online counseling provides a solution that allows these individuals to access professional support without having to worry about transportation or mobility issues. By eliminating the need for travel, online therapy makes mental health support accessible to a wider range of people.

Additionally, people living in remote areas where mental health professionals are scarce can benefit from online therapy. The convenience of accessing a licensed therapist without having to travel long distances to a city or town can be a game-changer for individuals in underserved areas. By leveraging online platforms, mental health professionals can reach and support those who might otherwise have limited access to care.

# Creating a Routine

Establishing a routine can be crucial for maintaining mental health. However, for many individuals, maintaining a consistent schedule with in-person appointments can be difficult due to work commitments, family responsibilities, or other factors. Online counseling allows clients to create a routine that works for them. With the flexibility to schedule sessions at convenient times, whether it's early in the morning, during lunch breaks, or late at night, individuals can incorporate therapy into their daily lives without disrupting their other commitments.

Having therapy available when needed can also promote consistency in treatment, leading to better outcomes in the long run. For example, individuals with depression or anxiety may benefit from having regular check-ins with a therapist to monitor their progress and adjust treatment strategies accordingly.

# 8. The Emotional Benefits of Online Counseling

# Reducing Stress and Anxiety

Many people experience stress or anxiety when seeking therapy, particularly if they have had negative experiences with traditional counseling in the past. The pressure of going to an office, meeting a new person, or even finding the ""right"" therapist can add to the stress. Online counseling helps eliminate these stressors by offering a relaxed, low-pressure environment.

Being in a familiar and comfortable space can help clients feel more at ease during their sessions, which can lead to more open and honest conversations. For individuals dealing with anxiety, the ability to connect with a therapist without the added pressure of being in a physical office setting can be a game-changer. This environment makes it easier to discuss sensitive issues like trauma, relationships, or self-esteem without the worry of being scrutinized.

# Boosting Self-Esteem and Confidence

Through consistent therapy, many individuals report improvements in their self-esteem and confidence. Online counseling allows clients to work through their personal struggles in a supportive, non-judgmental space. As they process their feelings and gain insight into their behaviors and thought patterns, individuals often experience a significant boost in self-esteem.

Therapists help guide clients through exercises and techniques designed to foster self-compassion and positive self-affirmations. Over time, these changes can lead to improvements in mental health, relationships, and overall life satisfaction. The emotional growth that takes place during online counseling can help individuals become more resilient, confident, and capable of managing life's challenges.

# Improved Coping Skills

In addition to building self-esteem, online counseling equips individuals with valuable coping mechanisms for managing stress, anxiety, and other emotional challenges. Therapists work with clients to identify their triggers and develop personalized strategies to deal with difficult emotions. These coping skills can range from mindfulness techniques and deep breathing exercises to cognitive reframing and behavioral modification strategies.

By learning how to manage stress and regulate emotions, individuals can build resilience and gain greater control over their mental well-being. For instance, someone dealing with workplace stress might learn specific techniques for managing anxiety during stressful situations. As a result, they can handle pressure more effectively and reduce feelings of burnout.

# 9. The Role of Online Counseling in Relationship Health

# Improving Communication Skills

Online counseling is not only helpful for individuals but can also be a valuable tool for couples and families. Many relationship issues stem from poor communication or misunderstandings. Online couples counseling allows partners to work on their communication skills in a non-threatening environment.

Therapists can help couples identify unhealthy patterns of communication, such as criticism, defensiveness, or stonewalling, and teach more constructive ways of engaging with one another. By improving communication, couples can learn to express their needs, set boundaries, and resolve conflicts in a healthy way, which leads to stronger and more fulfilling relationships.

# Strengthening Emotional Connection

Relationships often struggle when partners feel disconnected or unsupported. Online counseling can help couples reconnect emotionally by fostering a deeper understanding of each other's feelings and needs. Through therapy, couples can explore the underlying causes of their emotional disconnection and learn strategies for rebuilding intimacy and trust.

For individuals who may not feel comfortable discussing sensitive issues in person, online counseling can serve as a bridge to open up and address their concerns. With the guidance of a trained therapist, couples can work through challenges and develop a more secure, loving partnership.

# Family Therapy for Holistic Support

Online counseling isn't limited to couples‚Äîfamily therapy is also available for those who need support in navigating family dynamics. Whether you're dealing with conflict, parenting challenges, or generational differences, online family therapy provides a platform for all family members to come together and work through their issues.

Therapists can help family members develop better communication skills, address underlying emotional issues, and create solutions that promote a healthier family environment. By involving everyone in the process, online family therapy fosters understanding, empathy, and collaboration among family members, which can ultimately improve relationships and create a more supportive home environment.

# 10. The Long-Term Benefits of Online Counseling

# Sustaining Mental Health Progress

One of the key benefits of online counseling is the ability to maintain long-term progress in mental health. Unlike traditional therapy, which may require gaps between sessions or delays due to scheduling conflicts, online counseling offers a consistent platform for ongoing support. The flexibility of scheduling and easy access to therapists means that individuals can continue their therapy even during challenging times, ensuring that they stay on track with their healing journey.

In addition, many people who engage in online counseling report a sense of empowerment as they take control of their mental health. With the right tools, strategies, and support, individuals can experience lasting improvements in their well-being and continue to build on the progress they've made long after their therapy sessions have ended.

# Building a Lifelong Support System

Online counseling also helps individuals develop lifelong coping strategies that can be beneficial for years to come. As clients gain insight into their emotional and mental health patterns, they learn how to manage stress, navigate challenges, and regulate their emotions. These skills become an ongoing part of their toolkit for navigating life‚Äôs ups and downs.

Moreover, having a consistent therapeutic relationship‚Äîwhether online or in-person‚Äîcan help individuals feel supported during difficult times. Even after the therapy process is completed, knowing that there‚Äôs a professional to reach out to if needed can provide a sense of security and confidence moving forward.

# Conclusion: Empower Yourself with Online Counseling

In a world that often prioritizes physical health, taking care of our mental well-being is just as crucial. Online counseling is a transformative tool that can help you prioritize your mental health in a way that fits your life, needs, and preferences. With its accessibility, flexibility, and effectiveness, online counseling provides a unique opportunity to take control of your mental health journey.

Whether you're struggling with anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or simply need someone to talk to, online counseling offers a compassionate and effective space for healing. The ability to connect with licensed professionals from anywhere, at any time, ensures that you have the support you need, exactly when you need it.

So, take the first step toward prioritizing your mental health today. By embracing online counseling, you are empowering yourself to lead a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling life.",1,1734238756.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

BEFORE & AFTER 

I tried to crop this so it wasn‚Äôt so explicit! I have been battling hot spots for years on my dog and he gets them really bad in his genital area and back shins. I‚Äôve tried antibiotics from the vet, topical treatments for horses, new diets, religiously adding salmon oil to his food.. all of it. I started researching treatments for eczema in humans and a really popular one is colloidal baths. So I grounded up oatmeal into a fine powder (I have a coffee grinder) and in a bowl added 1 tablespoon of oatmeal powder to 2 tablespoons of boiling hot water, let it sit for 15 minutes and then rub the paste to the area. I wet a flour towel with warm water and let it sit on top of the paste on him for about 15 minutes, wipe it clean, I also added bio oil on top after it‚Äôs been cleaned and dried and did this once a day for 3 weeks. It has been 2 months and he hasn‚Äôt had a flare up! This has literally been a miracle! 

To truly test this, I applied the same treatment to one leg and treated the other leg with a topical treatment for hot spots recommended by the vet (picture 3). I‚Äôm starting the colloidal treatment for the bad leg tomorrow! ",3,1734238276.0,germanshepherds,0,1.0,False

I almost gave up on it, but thankfully, as the coffee cooled and I sipped more, the bitterness toned down significantly.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the orange flavor. It‚Äôs definitely there, not in-your-face artificial, but subtle and aromatic. It complements the coffee nicely once you get past that initial bitter punch. If you‚Äôre into bold flavors and don‚Äôt mind a slightly bitter start, this might be your cup of‚Ä¶well, coffee.

Overall, it‚Äôs a unique blend worth trying, especially if you‚Äôre a fan of citrusy notes in your coffee. Just be patient with the bitterness‚Äîit gets better. Would I get it again?

I recently drove up to Sacramento and by chance found a small Asian grocer that carried what might possibly be the best instant/freeze dried coffee mix I've ever tried thus far. Goes by the name 'Owl White Coffee Tarik' (I've included a pic in the post).

Could anyone tell me where I can possibly find this same coffee in the SGV (preferably somewhere in the Monterey Park, Alhambra, San Marino, Pasadena general area)? I believe that it's a Malaysian brand. Many thanks in advance!

1hel6i2,https://i.redd.it/8kqhh2oyzx6e1.jpeg,35m looking for a potential LDR.,"To be honest, a long distance relationship sounds unbearable, but I‚Äôm not having any luck where I am, when it comes to relationships. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the talking part that worries me, but the fact that I couldn‚Äôt hold that person each day, and especially, on stressful days. For now though, I suppose we‚Äôll get to all that at a later time.

Hello! I‚Äôm Nate. I‚Äôm 35, bisexual, and I‚Äôm from the US, specifically, Minnesota. My favorite part of the day is going to get coffee, which I sometimes make at home, but more often, I get at Starbucks. Despite the occasional ‚Äúharsh‚Äù Minnesota winter, I typically get an Iced Mocha all year long. Anyways, once I get my coffee, it‚Äôs off to work, and along the way, I pray for self control, because I do not want to show up to work having already finished that coffee. üòÖ 

For work, I enjoy helping our youth. Therefore, I spend that time at a program which helps them, and kids, learn new skills which will support them when it comes to maintaining positive mental health and behaviors. While I do truly enjoy it, some of these days are the ones that would make a long distance relationship hard, because I often want to come home and just hug/cuddle with someone.

In my free time, I enjoy watching tv/movies, playing video games, hanging out with friends, game nights, and traveling. Currently, I‚Äôve been to Tanzania, Ireland, London via layover, Canada, and both Honduras and Mexico via cruise. While, I certainly enjoy those trips, I definitely would like to see more. I hope to visit more of Europe, Asia, and South America.

When it comes to video games, I have a PS5 and Nintendo switch. I really enjoy games like Legend of Zelda, Assassin‚Äôs Creed, Resident Evil, Mario Kart, Pok√©mon, Harvest Moon, Skyrim, and Immortals Fenyx Rising.

Movies/Tv Shows - I typically enjoy fantasy, detective, medical, superhero, some anime, and some reality tv.

What am I looking for in a relationship? I want someone who can make me laugh and smile. I would like someone that‚Äôs kinda nerdy/geeky, like me, and who likes to go on adventures. I need someone that‚Äôs empathetic, kind, and affectionate.

Lastly, I tend to prefer younger guys, so my age range is about 25-36. However, if you‚Äôre younger than 25, you may be eligible to be considered my younger brother. This is a platonic role and one I take very seriously, as I‚Äôve never had a younger brother. If we connect and become brothers, I will do my best to always be there for you.

Also, I‚Äôm more likely to respond if you have your age, location, and a photo on your profile. ",8,1734238001.0,gaydating,0,1.0,False
1hel6hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1hel6hq/what_is_the_best_over_the_range_microwave/,What is the best over the range microwave convection oven?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission to upgrade my kitchen appliances lately, and I wanted to share my experience with finding the perfect over-the-range microwave convection oven. After countless hours of research and testing different models, I think I've found some really valuable insights that might help you out.

First off, let me tell you why I'm so excited about microwave convection ovens. These bad boys aren't your regular microwaves ‚Äì they're like having two appliances in one. The convection feature means you can actually bake, roast, and crisp food, not just reheat leftovers. Game changer, right?

I spent weeks comparing different models, reading reviews, and even talking to appliance store employees. Here's what I learned: the best over-the-range microwave convection ovens need to nail a few key things - cooking performance, ventilation power, and user-friendly features.

After trying out several models, I've found that the ones with at least 1000 watts of power and good convection heating elements tend to perform the best. The ventilation system should have at least 300 CFM (cubic feet per minute) to handle cooking smoke and odors effectively.

Some features I've found super useful include sensor cooking (it automatically adjusts cooking time and power), a large turntable (at least 13.5 inches), and easy-to-use preset cooking options. Trust me, when you're trying to cook dinner after a long day, these little conveniences make a huge difference.

I discovered this amazing collection of over-the-range microwave convection ovens at https://athometouch.com/convection-oven where you can compare different models and features. They've got detailed specs and customer reviews that really helped me make my decision.

One thing I wish someone had told me earlier: make sure to measure your space carefully! These units need specific dimensions to fit properly, and you'll want to check the height of your cabinets and the width of your range.

Installation is another factor to consider. While some people go the DIY route, I'd recommend getting professional installation if you're not super handy. The last thing you want is a expensive appliance hanging incorrectly above your stove.

Temperature consistency is crucial too. The best models maintain even heating throughout the cavity, whether you're using microwave or convection mode. This means no more partially cooked food or burnt edges!

I've found that models with stainless steel interiors tend to be more durable and easier to clean than those with painted surfaces. Plus, they look more professional and match well with other kitchen appliances.

Here's a pro tip: look for units with good warranties. The best manufacturers typically offer at least a one-year warranty on parts and labor. Some even extend coverage on certain components for longer periods.

Bottom line: investing in a quality over-the-range microwave convection oven is totally worth it. It saves counter space, combines two appliances in one, and can handle everything from reheating coffee to baking cookies. Just make sure to do your homework on dimensions, features, and installation requirements before making your choice.

Bought one of these to see how it differs with the stock/standard basket.

So far I like that its base is squared off with the walls, making for a nicer tamp. There are also many more holes that appear smaller.

The downside is cleaning all of these holes as they trap spent coffee much more readily.

I‚Äôve noticed that I need to grind a bit finer to maintain the same shot time.

After several years of anxiety/depression meds and therapy/trauma work for PTSD, I was able to get those symptoms under control and realized that, despite having a handle on my anxiety and depression, I'm a sh*t show. 

Through journaling and tracking behaviors, very clear patterns have emerged. Executive dysfunction, time blindness, compulsive procrastination, sensory issues, revenge bedtime procrastination...I'm either hyperfocused on one thing to the point where nothing else exists, or I'm everywhere all at once, doing nothing well...inability to function in social situations because masking for over 40 years has drained me to the point where I'd prefer to not see another person aside from my family for weeks than to expend what little energy I have on trying to pretend to be ""normal."" Sleep issues...inability to wake up in the morning regardless of how long I sleep. I keep earbuds in 24 hours so that I always either have an audiobook or white noise or rain noise...I have to have them in the grocery store or I feel like I'll crawl out of my skin. Leaving the house for anything other than the grocery store, I may as well be packing for a week long trip because I carry everything I could possibly need on my person and have a bag for the car in case I need something that doesn't fit in my purse. 

If I didn't work from home, I wouldn't have a job because I can't focus for weeks at a time, then suddenly cram 2 weeks worth of work into an 18 hour day. I spend no less than 30 min a day (no exaggeration) looking for the thing I JUST HAD in my hand (or did I?? All I know is that I had it last time I reached for it, and now it's gone, and I didn't even GO anywhere!?) I can remember song lyrics I learned in 1983 and what room I was in when I obsessively stood over the record player playing the same song on repeat til I learned it because I couldn't move on to the next song until I learned that one...I can remember work related emails from 3 years ago, leaving my colleagues scratching their head as to how I can remember that, but ask me if I had breakfast or took my meds...or what my husband said when he came upstairs 30 minutes ago while I was trying to send that work email, and I'm blank. 

I have to leave everything I own out so I can see it or I forget it exists, but then there are so many things out that I can be staring at the thing I need and don't see it. I can drive past that one shop every day for 3 years on the way to the grocery store and still look at my husband like he grew an extra eye when he says, ""you know, that shop over by the Food Lion?"" NO...I don't because I have never stopped there, so it doesn't exist, and I couldn't tell you the name of it if there was a billion dollars at stake. I have to keep granola or nuts or dry fruit at my desk or I'll forget to eat. I have to keep a bottle of water, a thermos of iced coffee, an ensure and a mug of coffee all at once and rarely finish any of them. I can't finish a project if my life depended on it. Starting anything that requires more than one step makes me freeze up. I wake up knowing I have a doctor's appointment today, and somehow still miss it. I have reminders set in my phone to take out trash, pay bills, and still I forget until the trash truck is coming down the road and I get disconnect notices...

I could go on, but those are just the most prominent symptoms, all of which I thought were just normal or that it was because of trauma/anxiety. As these patterns emerged once my anxiety was under control, it was actually my therapist who asked if I had ever been tested, and I was dumbstruck when I really considered everything as a whole. My daughter, who is now 27, was diagnosed at 7, but I had never considered it for myself.

Of course, I was never tested. I went to school in the 80s and 90s in rural southeast Texas with a mom who was a preacher and didn't believe in therapy. ADHD wasn't really part of the national conversation until I was in high school, and even then, it was for little boys who couldn't sit still, and the general attitude in my neck of the woods was that they just needed a more discipline. I was a girl, and was also blessed and cursed to be a ""gifted"" kid, though I was the most disorganized gifted kid in my class. I'd start the year with color coded book covers and folders and dividers and tabs, and by the end of the first 6 weeks, my science homework was spilling out of my math book, and my notes for English were loose in my pocket, my locker was so crammed full I had to slam it shut and lean against it just to lock it, and my book bag looked like the inside of a trash can. Still, I understood a lot of things naturally and was interested in certain subjects, so in those, I excelled. But if I didn't understand it on the first pass or wasn't interested in it, no amount of effort was going to help me ""get it."" But because I was intelligent and did so well in other areas, I was just lazy, not trying hard enough, focused on the wrong things...etc. 

So my therapist and I have discussed it every 2 weeks for a year, and eliminated other possible causes for my ""symptoms,"" tried behavior modification for others, most of which has failed miserably and left me frustrated and exhausted. Of course, my therapist can't diagnose me, and my medication provider had to be the one to refer me for testing, and I put that conversation off for months because I was afraid to  seem like I was self diagnosing or medication seeking, but I finally realized that, ADHD or not, something in my brain is not functioning the way the average brain functions, and certainly doesn't function at a level that I need it to function to do every day life successfully without feeling like every moment is a struggle. Top that with the fact that I'm perimenopausal, so that exacerbates everything. 

But I finally worked up the nerve and had the conversation, got the referral and was on the waiting list for testing for months. Finally, I got the appointment. It was 4 phases...a series of self reporting questionnaires, a telehealth interview, the actual testing, and an exit interview. I just did the testing portion on Friday, and now I'm just freaking out. First of all, the interview didn't feel very productive. He focused a lot on my trauma and not so much on my symptoms, and toward the end of the interview, he asked, ""so what makes you think you have ADHD?"" The question took me off guard. I filled out 8 pages worth of forms and wrote you a whole essay explaining why I thought I had it...because I can organize my thoughts on paper, but not so much verbally. I felt like I was being asked to justify myself, and felt defensive. I blanked. All I could do was repeat some of the anecdotal stories I had written about in my self reporting, which made it feel rehearsed, and now I'm worried he's going to think it WAS rehearsed. It wasn't...but it's all I could fall back on when put on the spot. And afterward, I realized how many symptoms I totally missed mentioning and how weak and incomplete my answer was.

Then the testing, which I did Friday. They said it should take 2 hours, maybe a little more. It took 4. The computer part was pretty straightforward because it was timed. I did the whole click the mouse when the specified number appears on the screen or is said aloud, and don't click it when the other number is said or shown. I did okay during the first half, lost focus and bombed for a minute or two, but overall, I feel like I did better on it than a person with ADHD should. Then there was the timed test where you have to compare patterns and choose which one doesn't match the rest. I know I did atrociously, bad on that. SO BAD that I'm afraid it will look like I bombed it on purpose, but that has ALWAYS been a struggle for me, even when it isn't timed. 

Then there was the paperwork, which was not timed. They put me alone in a room...said I could use the desk or the comfy chair and clipboard. I chose the chair. I don't have any idea how it took me so long.

Most of the forms were repeats of the self reporting questions I had already answered, just asked over and over in different ways. The actual TEST part that felt like IQ or SAT questions only comprised 3 of the 15 or so pages, which was surprising. Vocabulary, which increased in difficulty, I know I aced until the bottom portion. I knew the definitions of all of the words until the last section, and I'd never heard of any of those words in my life, so I had to guess. Then there was the page of spotting patterns and filling in what's next in the series or what is missing in the series. 

I felt stuck because I don't do well with those types of questions in my head, but then I noticed that there was a dry erase board and markers. So I used it. I also noticed there was a noise machine, which I put on thunder sounds. I wish the tester would have mentioned the noise machine because it took me til halfway through the test to notice it, and once I noticed it, I wondered if I was allowed to use it since she didn't mention it...but it really helped me focus and I figured it wouldn't be there if I wasn't supposed to use it. And I wish she would have mentioned that I could use the dry erase board because I also sat there and struggled with the series/patterns questions until I noticed the board. It really helped. 

Still, I thought I was answering the questions at a fairly normal rate of speed, but at one point, the tester popped in and asked if there were any of the papers she could start looking at. Then I realized they were having an office Christmas lunch party, and I was cutting into their time. I started testing at 8:30. How did it get all the way into lunch time?? When she popped in to take up the work I had finished, I was standing on my knees in the chair backward so I could reach the dry erase board, and I had a marker in my mouth, one in my hand, one behind my ear, and was writing furiously on the board like I was solving the equation of gravity. She looked at me and the board, which, by this point looked like a conspiracy theorist's wall, only if the conspiracy involved learning the alphabet and simple math. She didn't say a word, but it made me wonder if I was even supposed to have used the board at all. 

After she popped in, I panicked and felt like I was holding them up, so I just gave up on the last 3 series that I had been stuck on and just had to guess because if I had stayed until I solved them (if I ever solved them) it could have been another hour or more. 

After I left, I felt a bit let down by the tests overall because 80% of them had nothing to do with actually testing and more about answering whether I'm depressed or abusing substances or have anger issues...and the parts that were actual testing, aside from the computer portion where I had to pick out which patterns didn't fit, which I bombed, I think I did pretty well on even if it did take me an hour longer than they said it should have, and I'm left wondering if the test is actually going to reflect anything helpful. 

I'm just sick with worry now about the whole thing. I'm terrified I'm going to get my results and they're going to say that I'm just depressed or it's just anxiety. I KNOW it's more than that. I just don't see how the tests I did will reflect the clusterfuck that is my brain. It's all I can think about, and it's amping my anxiety level up higher than it's been in over 3 years. 

I guess I don't really have a question. I just needed to vent to people who (hopefully?) understand what I'm going through.",1,1734237817.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Me and my boyfriend where sitting at the table and I was about to get up and make some coffee, next thing I know he's snapping his fingers in my face and saying ""woman make me some coffee"" I took offense to that, so I GRABBED his fingers (not hard at all!)  to get him to listen to me while I lectured him about calling me woman and snapping his fingers in my face. Afterwards he went to bed silent. 
The next day he's screaming at me about how I could've broken his fingers when there was no way I could even do that. He called me an asshole when I just felt like I was sticking up for myself. I have never truly snapped back at him until then. And I've never done it sense bc that's not the type of person I am. I never kicked punched or did anything to remotely hurt him.

But idk..AITAH for sticking up for myself?



Just to make this known this is the only time I've truly snapped back after him doing that. Last time I tried talking to him about it he laughed. 
He was treating me like I was a maid and im only there to do his bidding. 
I've always felt like a mother more than a girlfriend. He can't cook clean or even do his own laundry. 
Before someone says that I hurt him when he did nothing to me..honey read some of my other posts. You'll understand everything I went thru with that man. 
I tried to leave but he would just threaten suicide and manipulate me. Im a very emotional person so it's easy to hurt/manipulate me. He has laid hands on me before leaving marks. But there's no way I could've fought back. 
Ik it didn't hurt him or anything bc he went right back to doing it.

* I avoid unnecessary drama but won‚Äôt shy away from resolving conflicts through mature conversations. I believe in addressing issues rather than letting them pile up.
* Interests:
   * My downtime usually involves binge-watching K-dramas, snapping photos, or reading a good book.
   * Obsessed with pasta, coffee dates, and discovering new restaurants.
* I‚Äôm not apolitical, and I believe in standing up for what‚Äôs right. Definitely not a Marcos/Duterte supporter‚Äîsocial awareness is important to me.
* I‚Äôm based in Manila, so it would be nice to meet someone nearby for easier meetups. 
* I have a strong personality and can be opinionated.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For in You:

* 21-27 years old. Older guys tend to be more mature, which I like, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll tolerate immaturity or manipulation just because I‚Äôm younger.
* No girlfriends, kids, or open relationships. I‚Äôm here for a genuine, uncomplicated connection.
* You understand the importance of personal space and aren‚Äôt pushy about things.
* You don‚Äôt smoke and take care of yourself. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into fitness or can cook.
* I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs ready for a serious relationship. No games, just a real connection.
* It‚Äôs easier to plan dates and hangouts when we‚Äôre in the same area. Bonus points if you‚Äôre a fellow Thomasian!
* I want someone who‚Äôs willing to share their world while embracing mine. Even if we have different hobbies, we can learn from each other.
* While I don‚Äôt have pets right now, I‚Äôd love to have one someday. It‚Äôs a plus if you love animals as much as I do!
* Someone who enjoys memes, silly debates, and random jokes.
* Someone who keeps their word and values trust. I‚Äôm not here for inconsistent communication or flaky behavior.
* I enjoy watching and playing sports occasionally, so it‚Äôd be fun if we could share this interest‚Äîor at least cheer each other on!

I‚Äôm not rushing into anything, but I‚Äôm serious about finding someone who‚Äôs ready for a committed relationship. I believe the best relationships are built on mutual respect, trust, and shared effort.

If you think we‚Äôd get along, send me a message! Let‚Äôs start with a conversation, see if we vibe, and who knows‚Äîmaybe we‚Äôll find something special together. üòä",0,1734236903.0,PhR4Dating,1,0.5,False
1hekub3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hekub3/which_rim_of_the_grand_canyon_is_most_scenic/,Which rim of the Grand Canyon is most scenic?,"Hey fellow travelers! I just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I had to share my experience with you all. If you're thinking about visiting this natural wonder, this might be exactly what you're looking for.

I've always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon but wasn't sure about making the drive myself (it's about 4.5 hours from Vegas). After doing some research, I found this awesome tour package that basically takes care of everything for you. I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim and honestly, it was worth every penny.

The tour starts early (around 6 AM), but don't let that discourage you - they pick you up right from your hotel, and the bus is super comfortable with AC and a bathroom. Pro tip: bring a neck pillow for the journey. I managed to catch some Z's on the way there!

We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona (great for coffee and snacks), and our guide kept us entertained with interesting facts about the region. Did you know the Grand Canyon is over 277 miles long? Mind-blowing stuff!

The real magic happens when you reach the South Rim. We visited multiple viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point - each offering a completely different perspective of the canyon. The colors are absolutely insane, especially during sunset. Your Instagram feed will thank you!

The tour includes a meal voucher, which was actually pretty decent. I opted for the IMAX movie upgrade ($15 extra), and it was totally worth it - gives you a whole new appreciation for the canyon's scale and history.

Here's what really impressed me: they offer optional upgrades like a Hummer tour along the rim or a helicopter flight over the canyon. I didn't spring for these (maybe next time!), but the folks who did couldn't stop raving about it.

Some practical advice:
- Wear comfortable shoes (you'll do more walking than you think)
- Bring a refillable water bottle
- Don't forget your camera/phone charger
- Layer up (temperature varies throughout the day)

The whole experience takes about 14 hours, and prices start at $80. Considering it includes transportation, guide service, and food, it's pretty reasonable. You can check current prices and book here: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim

Bottom line: If you're in Vegas and want to check the Grand Canyon off your bucket list without the hassle of planning everything yourself, this tour is perfect. The guides are knowledgeable, everything's organized efficiently, and the views are absolutely unforgettable.

Feel free to drop any questions in the comments. Happy to share more details about my experience!",1,1734236726.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False
