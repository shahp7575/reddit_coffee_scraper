1m0z6p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1m0z6p3/i_spent_way_too_much_time_figuring_out_how_to_get/,I spent way too much time figuring out how to get Google Veo 3 for free - here's what actually works,"So I've been testing Google Veo 3 (their text-to-video tool) and honestly got tired of hitting paywalls everywhere. After digging around, I found three legit ways to use it for months without spending anything. Figured I'd share since everyone's asking about this.

**The three methods that actually work:**

1. **30-day Google AI Pro trial**¬†\- This one's straightforward. Sign in with your Google account, start the Pro trial, and you get three video generations per day. Each clip is up to 8 seconds with built-in audio.
2. **$300 Google Cloud credit**¬†\- When you create a new Google Cloud account, they give you $300 in credits. You can use these on Vertex AI to access Veo 3 directly. Depending on how much you use it, this can last 6-10 weeks.
3. **Promotional codes**¬†\- Google occasionally sends out promo codes through their marketing emails. These are hit-or-miss but can add extra free time.

**What I learned about making better prompts:**

* Keep it under 600 characters
* Break scenes with double slashes like ""morning coffee shop // customer walks in // steam rises from cup""
* Add specific sound cues in quotes like ""gentle rain"" or ""crowd cheering""
* Upload a reference photo if you need consistent branding or specific looks

**The reality check:**

* You get 720p videos, not 4K
* Each clip maxes out at 8 seconds
* You'll need to stitch clips together in any video editor
* It's available in 70+ countries but still pending in EU/UK

The combo approach works best - start with the Pro trial, then switch to Cloud credits when that runs out. I managed to stretch this to about 3 months of regular use.

For the full breakdown with step-by-step instructions, check out the complete guide here:¬†[https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/google-veo-3-free/](https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/google-veo-3-free/)

1m0z6i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeMightBeDrunk/comments/1m0z6i5/were_just_friends_duo_strikes_again/,‚Äúwe‚Äôre just friends‚Äù duo strikes again,"Eyewitness reports confirmed by an anonymous Gossip Cadet (who absolutely did not have their phone camera ready ‚Äújust in case‚Äù) reveal that Amy and Robert were spotted leaving for the gym together again. But not without trying to keep up appearances.

According to our source, the two exited the academy dorms with military-level precision, attempting a 20-second separation interval like they were on a covert ops mission. Robert stepped out first‚Äîduffel bag in hand, protein shaker locked and loaded‚Äîonly to casually hover near the entrance, ‚Äústretching‚Äù his calves (that haven‚Äôt grown in 3 months, btw) while scanning for witnesses.

Roughly 19.5 seconds later, Amy emerged in full Gym Shark regalia, hair up, shades on, pretending to fumble with her AirPods as if she hadn‚Äôt literally just left Robert‚Äôs room.

But our Gossip Cadet was ready.

‚ÄúThey tried to stagger like they‚Äôre strangers, but we all saw the door shut behind Amy,‚Äù the source whispered, sipping their iced coffee dramatically. ‚ÄúThe vibes screamed 'we‚Äôre sore from yesterday‚Äôs leg day‚Ä¶ not from the stairmaster.'‚Äù
By the time they got into Robert‚Äôs truck (yes, same truck, despite pretending like they‚Äôd drive separately), the parking lot surveillance‚Äîor at least 3 people looking out their dorm windows‚Äîhad already pieced the story together. Robert, notably, did not do his usual 5-minute truck warm-up session, likely trying to reduce exposure time. But you can‚Äôt fool trained cadets with sharp eyes and bored mornings.

Some questions remain:

Are they working out... or working it out?
Was the 20-second rule rehearsed?
And who keeps leaving Amy‚Äôs pink HydroFlask in Robert‚Äôs backseat?
More to come as this gym saga unfolds. But remember, cadets‚Äîyou can delay a departure, but you can‚Äôt hide a situationship.

After trying different approaches, I found three solid methods to use it for months without spending anything. Figured this community would want the real details.

**Three methods that actually deliver free access:**

1. **30-day Gemini Pro trial**¬†\- Sign up through Google One for the free trial. Once it's active, you'll see the ""Video"" tab appear in your Gemini interface. You get 3 video generations per day, each up to 8 seconds with built-in audio.
2. **$300 Google Cloud credit approach**¬†\- Create a fresh Google Cloud account and you automatically receive $300 in credits. Point these at Vertex AI's ""generative video (Google Veo 3)"" endpoint. Depending on how much you generate, this can last 6-10 weeks.
3. **Promotional email codes**¬†\- Google occasionally distributes promo codes through their AI and Cloud marketing emails. These are unpredictable but can add bonus free time when they appear.

**What I learned about getting better results:**

* Keep prompts under 600 characters for optimal processing
* Structure scenes using double slashes: ""morning coffee shop // customer enters // steam rises from cup""
* Include specific audio cues in quotes like ""gentle rain"" or ""crowd applause""
* Upload reference images when you need consistent branding or character appearance
* Remember it outputs 720p at 24fps - external upscaling needed for 4K

**Current limitations to be aware of:**

* 8-second maximum per generation
* Available in 70+ countries (EU/UK rollout still pending)
* Flow editor is in preview mode - pricing may change later
* Commercial use is permitted under current terms

**The combination strategy that worked best:**  
Start with the Gemini Pro trial for immediate browser access, then transition to Cloud credits when it expires. With the occasional promo code, I managed roughly 3 months of consistent testing.

The key insight is stacking these methods rather than depending on just one. The Pro trial gives you seamless integration with Gemini's interface, while Cloud credits provide more flexibility for batch processing.

üíöI'll nurture, praise and guide you. Task, reward and punish - then we'll vent about life, watch Last Meals on youtube and Monday Night RAW live together, exchange songs and gossip.

‚Ä¢ **My top qualities** include safe communication, adaptability, complete honesty and understanding. My patience is long, but not unlimited.

‚Ä¢ **My hobbies**, which I could talk about forever with the right people...

ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *WWE* - particularly when I can have small watch parties. Say my name, and I appear.

üç≤ *Cooking* - which I'll constantly show off. Feeding people is my love language.

üç™ *Baking* - which I'll definitely show off because it's a pain in the ass and yet so satisfying

üå≤ *Forests* - walking through forests is my ideal relaxing time. I'll send you mushroom photos and you'll be forced to learn about them.

üßµ *Crafting* - I like working with my hands and creating various jewelery and accessories, even if it's a pain with long nails.

üç∏ *Drinks* - both making them and going out. Buy me an Amaretto Sour, a Gin Tonic or some fruity shots.


‚Ä¢ **Preferences**
- I remain *Faceless*, until trust is established and time has passed.
- Telegram as a way of communication, Instagram if all goes well and you become my favorite.

üïØÔ∏è **Kinks** I'll let you explore with me, along with financial domination.
(Always open to explore different things)

- *Worshiping*
- *Petplay*
- *Feet*
- *SPH*
- *Ignoring*
- *Public humiliation tasks*
- *Blackmail*
- *Wax play*


‚Ä¢ My **ideal sub**: loyal, needy, devoted, obsessed. Spam me. Worship me with everything you've got - money, words, soul. Bonus points if you're rather dominant in your day-to-day life - but soft for me. 

‚Ä¢ My **ideal dynamic**: True connection and conversations. Daily check-ins at the very least. You wake me up with a coffee, I tease you while you're at work. You turn me on with sends, I *might* let you touch yourself. You complete my tasks, I praise and reward you for being my sweet thing. 
You keep me satisfied and entertained, *I* keep *you*. 

üíöIf our dynamic lasts, I'll eventually spam you with selfies, memes and reels on Instagram.

üíöIf you've made it this far, honestly... What a good pet. You might now want to know about...


üå±The **Ideal Introduction**:

-You say ""Hello, Miss Shadow""

1m0ysro,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1m0ysro/just_another_mean_customer_story/,just another mean customer story üôÑ,"Woman comes up to my register asking what a medium-roast is, I explain it to her. She says she doesn‚Äôt want coffee she wants the normal bean roast drink. She‚Äôs clearly a European tourist btw, couldn‚Äôt place the accent but i‚Äôd guess West/Central Europe. Anyway, she doesn‚Äôt want ‚Äúany of the other crap we have‚Äù, begins to insult the menu, try and make me feel stupid for the options on the menu, and get angry at me as I try and explain a medium-roast and understand what she wants. She just wants a plain black coffee, none of our ‚Äúother crap in that‚Äù. 

We hand out her drink within like 30 seconds it‚Äôs a black coffee we have a clover etc.. she won‚Äôt take it because her name is spelled one letter off, more so ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my name I won‚Äôt take it‚Äù, I understand her, but she had an unamerican name and got mad when I asked her how to spell that ü•¥. She doesn‚Äôt let anyone know that she‚Äôs not taking the drink (she knows it‚Äôs for her), then she sees my coworker making an americano add almond milk and stops her from adding almond milk because ‚Äúmy order didn‚Äôt have that‚Äù. My coworker is confused but is sequencing so she goes to her other drink, this woman snaps her fingers and tells her she‚Äôs not allowed to work on another drink ‚Äúright now‚Äù. So my coworker says are you Kevin tall americano splash of almond milk, and the woman gets mad because she‚Äôs not. After fighting with her to get her name, my coworker shows her it‚Äôs the coffee RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. She gets mad says that‚Äôs not her name, says there‚Äôs no room for cream and sugar. 

0/10 interaction and I had to watch it multitasking on front and warm.. i‚Äôm sure it was much more intense actually happening. ",8,1752626415.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False
1m0yrwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1m0yrwc/chronic_fatigue/,Chronic fatigue,"Its the most persistent symptom for me.

Ive been on Remicade for months now and it helped so much. Less pain, no more blood, but the fatigue is always always there.

I can sleep 8 hours a night and wake up tired.

Blood tests showed no anemia and no deficiency. 

I don‚Äôt know how to manage that, my doctor is of very lil help with that. I cant drink coffee not even tea so energy drinks are absolutely out of the question too. I eat well and enough. 

Is there something I should try to help that or should I just accept it? Its extremely hard to work and study full time that way its so frustrating.

1m0yqte,https://i.redd.it/x2figjoot4df1.png,Looking for Japanese Indie(?) song I only saved on my ex's Apple Music,"(The above is my poor redition of what the cover might look like, more details below) 

I know it's real long shot as it was all in Japanese so I can't name a single word from it, and the details are shaky, Basically I loved this song and always listened to it on my ex's account, but forgot to save the name before moving out, but I still think of it and look for it 5 years later. I've looked exhaustively through Japanese cafe/indie type playlists but no dice so far.

Here is all the indentifying info I can recall:

- The singer was female, and I think only her (e.g. not a girl group)
- All the lyrics were Japanese / if any were in English it was so few I don't recall it at all
- I'm not sure the exact genre but alt, indie, soft pop, all wouldn't surprise me. It was a gentle & sweet sounding song. I believe the instrumentals were acoustic guitar and/or piano
- I think the title was part english part Japanese, but I'm not certain. The English was something like any or none of the following: Sunday, Saturday, Day(s), Spring, Cleaning, Summer, Laundry
- I was listening to it before 2020, and I think as far back as 2018, so at the very least it must have come out before 2020
- At the time, it was only on Apple Music and not on Spotify
- I found it in a recommended playlist/radio thing that was probably something like morning vibes, coffee shop, morning chill, weekend chill, cafe, etc
- It's not by YAOSOBI, DAOKO, or mamerico (obviously there are many artists it isn't by, but these three are often recommended when I try searching for it)
- (see above) I think the cover was mostly white with something colorful and horizontal, probably in teal/red/blue. I'm not certain though so it's not a deal breaker if the cover is completely different from that lol. I added a poor drawing of that I remember it vaguely looking like (shockingly google lens & reverse image search did not pick anything up from this)

I know it's a long shot but I'll be so happy if I can find it again!! Thank you :) ",1,1752626257.0,NameThatSong,0,1.0,False

1m0yqlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1m0yqlq/husband_rarely_wants_sex/,Husband rarely wants sex,"Both in our late 20s and we've been married for 6 years. We have a kid now too. While we were dating he had a really high sex drive and always wanted it, but once we got married it went down a bit. I thought it was just because we saw each other every day vs a few times a week when we were dating. We had sex a couple times a week in the beginning and that was good for me. But as the yrs have passed I have to always initiate myself and most of the time I'm turned down. I've asked him about it and he always has a different excuse. One thing he does say often is that the chase is over so he doesn't feel like going after me. I don't even know what this means lol like are you insinuating you're not interested in having sex because I married you???

I can't figure out how to fix this. I always try to talk to him about it and I get a different excuse each time which is really becoming frustrating and I'm getting angry. I try to retaliate by not doing favors for him like making him coffee or throwing his clothes in the dryer for him etc, small stupid tasks. But then he throws the this is why I don't have sex with you because you're rude. Like what?

1m0ypde,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1m0ypde/she_came_back_i_let_her_and_im_a_wreck_dont_let/,"She came back, I let her, and I‚Äôm a wreck - Don‚Äôt let them come back (usually)","The usually is a caveat for the situations which are outliers. 

We dated for six months. It‚Äôs a long story but it was a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù where we did everything couples do, but she was extremely avoidant and couldn‚Äôt acknowledge her feelings or commit officially (despite being exclusive sexually with me, without my asking). 

After six months of being gaslit (being told us going on dates, having sex, talking on the phone for hours a day were all friend things), I broke up with her. She still thinks she broke up with me, which she didn‚Äôt lol. 

I went no contact, although I didn‚Äôt block her. She tried to goad me into contacting her numerous times. 

Eventually, after a few months, we ran into each other organically. She wanted to get coffee, and then lunch, and talk. She admitted she missed me, she said she realised she only ever saw me as a friend (and then kind of said the opposite a few days later), she told me she‚Äôs already seeing other people but it isn‚Äôt serious or long term etc etc. She said ‚ÄúI can have you back whenever I want‚Äù which is totally cool and normal lmao. 

Anyway, after that point our communication began again and I allowed it. It started as her just sending memes, then it became messaging about our days, and recently it‚Äôs become her calling me every night to chat before bed (which is what we did when we dated). She did ditch the guy she was seeing as soon as I was back in the picture but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs related. 

We spent time together yesterday and I told her I wanted to kiss her, and she kissed my cheek when we parted. The last two phone calls she has taken her clothes off when we were chatting (video call). 

She called me again last night and once again the ‚Äúthis is just friends stuff‚Äù gaslighting happened. I teased her about the cheek kiss and she basically said it‚Äôs what friends do (not friends who recently broke up I fear). I asked her why tf she wants to talk to me so much if we are just friendly, and she said ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd be over me by now‚Äù (it‚Äôs been only two months). 

I sent her a message telling her that I don‚Äôt mind her being around, I don‚Äôt mind us even being flirty, but I am tired of her behaving that way and then basically outright stating that I‚Äôm delusional. It makes me feel icky as fuck and really invalidated and it did the entire time we dated. 

I spent the whole night crying because this has just pulled back up a lot of the stuff I‚Äôd almost started to heal in no contact. The feelings of being confused, wondering why she wants so much of me but not all of me, wondering why she won‚Äôt just leave me tf alone, wondering what‚Äôs so wrong with me etc. 

I regret letting her back in at all without expressly stating I‚Äôd only speak to her right now if she admitted romantic interest (even if not intention) and was finally honest. And if she couldn‚Äôt, that she should leave me alone and I‚Äôd reach out to her if I ever felt like entertaining friendship (we aren‚Äôt good at it).

However, despite giving them a try, I‚Äôve found that neither seems to help at all. How is this possible? I feel absolutely NOTHING. My doctor was surprised because she‚Äôs never had a patient like me.

My focus remains scattered, and I don‚Äôt feel the energy boost I expect. It‚Äôs been frustrating, especially since stimulants are the go-to treatment for ADHD. I really wish I could experience how a ""normal"" person operates‚Äînow that would be magical.

My main issues are a lack of executive function, poor time management, and constant fatigue. I wake up feeling foggy and tired, and I can‚Äôt get anything done at work. As a professor with a PhD, I honestly don‚Äôt even know how I managed to finish it‚ÄîI just relied on my hyperactivity and the mental pressure of serious deadlines to push me into doing things last minute. When I do focus, I work really well, often for 10 hours straight. But it‚Äôs extremely hard to initiate tasks, pace myself, or break things down into manageable steps.

I‚Äôve also noticed that even coffee, which some people use to boost their energy or alertness, has no effect on me. It‚Äôs almost as if my brain just doesn‚Äôt respond to these stimulants, leaving me wondering if something else is at play.

Has anyone else experienced this? It can be disheartening to try different medications and not see any changes. If you‚Äôve gone through a similar experience, what has worked for you?

Some people have suggested physiotherapy or behavioral therapy, but honestly, I think they‚Äôre BS. Lol.

Quick backstory - in 2016, I weighed about 90 kilos. 5ft7in, nearly no muscle. I was FAT!

Then, over the summer at uni, I got a warehouse job. Lots of heavy lifting. It paid me enough for rent, and the bus to/from work, nothing more! I literally starved, surviving off free suggary tea and coffee at work.

2 months later, I was down to 60kg, and looked (if I may say so!) absolutely beautiful. I'd never felt so happy and free in my own skin :)

It lasted a few years, but my new job (restaurant), and all the free food, local shops offering all my favourite goodies... Oof. Back to 85kg.

""Why don't I fast again?! I've done it before!""

Well, I'm on 48hrs now, and I'm remembering the sheer, absolute misery of the initial few days haha. A \*near\* pure water fast (a dash of lemon juice in water once or twice a day, ya know :p). 

Reading through this sub though, so many success stories! I absolutely cannot wait to eventually add mine here, it's a big motivator for me to actually stick with it! My fiance and I are about to have ""dinner"" (him eating while I watch :/), which will probably be the biggest hurdle...   
  
Anyway, just wanted to contribute a little of my own journey. I hope to back in a few weeks with good news!

\--

About 2 weeks ago, I was chilling, watching and browsing YouTube videos.. suddenly my page refreshed on its own and I noticed that my YouTube account got disconnected. I tried to log back In but the Google/Gmail account attached to it got disconnected also. Strange.. meanwhile, my professional Gmail and some other worthless Gmail accounts remained intact, untouched.

 No matter, I proceeded paying no mind, I entered my email and password, I got prompted to verify my Identity which is nice, so, I entered the phone number that I've set for recovery.. but.. I kept getting red text prompts saying **""We don‚Äôt support delivering messages to your provider at this time. Try a number from a different provider.""** I tried a second and third time just to make sure in case the system was bugged or maybe because I made an error while entering the phone number, but, it wasn't the case as I kept getting the same red text over and over. So, I decided to use a different option which is to enter a family's phone number instead. It didn't work.

  
I googled a bit, looked up the issue online, extremely few community posts and similar articles were found about said incident, nothing useful really. I waited a day, tried again, same thing. I waited 2 more days, tried again, SAME outcome! What in the hell? Why is this happening, WHY can't I receive a verification code through text message even though I've tried multiple phone numbers AND from different ISPs???

I then, decided to dig a bit further in Google's help pages and such, and found a ""help"" AI bot which wasn't helpful at all (spoiler), I asked for assistance and instructions on how to proceed with the recovery of my account and such, It recommended me to send an appeal, I welcomed that option and took the steps necessary to do it, and let me tell you something, I laughed, yes, I laughed in the middle of that procedure, why? HERE's WHY! First, you log in to the account in question, Second: Duuh, you enter your password, Third: Captcha bullshit, Fourth: VERIFY IDEEENTITYYYYYYY, therefoooore, TEXT MESSAAAAGGEEEE! HILARIOUS! EXCELLENT JOB!

I looked around whether there is a Google customer support or a help email I could contact etc, NOTHING, NADA! Pathetic.

The day after, I came here on Reddit and posted about it here: [LINK TO THREAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1lr2b8m/my_gmail_and_youtube_channel_got_locked_for/) hoping to find a solution or at least get some useful tips on how to do things properly, all I was advised to do is to give it a bit more time, a couple of days. 5 or 6 days later, I think I have waited more than enough I gave it almost a full week just in case. With that being said, today, I woke up after waiting several days, attempted to Log back In just to find out that my account got locked and disabled and on the verge of deletion. WHAT?????????? WHY???????? WHAT HAPPENED???? ANSWER ME!!!! They AT LEAST gave me the option to send in an appeal this time, which I embraced. Waited almost a whole day, received a feedback on one of my other accounts, saying that I can finally Log back In.. Oh yea?? Let's see if that's true!

No, Na uh uhhh, not so fast boy! We are back to square zero, we still need you to verify who you are, please enter your phone number so that we can laugh at you for the 10th time :DDDD..... BRUH Moment  
  
I can't take it no longer, I tried different phone numbers again, I tried other devices.. but In vain..  
   
WAIT! LUCKILY, a friend of mine is abroad, they went to study and hopefully seek a better life there, I've hit them up ASAP, asked them if they got my back on this one, they said YES instantly, 0 hesitation, entered their number instead, IT WORKED! LFGGGGGG!!! Can't believe it! Entered the god damn code, logged In finally, STRAIGHT THE F AWAY, removed the recovery number from the account and walked away to get some refreshing water for myself.

I guess, this is the end, I never ever ever ever had such incident with this dogshit Google recovery system before, I made Google account since 2008 and such.   
It's heartbreaking to find pointless instructions, none to 0 guidance online, and on top of that, there is absolutely no customer support! Shameful!

Anyways, I wish you guys never have to deal with this bullshit ever. Cheers. ",3,1752625300.0,GMail,0,1.0,False
1m0ydus,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0ydus,First marathon,"I (late 30s male, 180 cm, 75kg) ran my first marathon: Cairns marathon (Australia). Very happy to reach the finish line, happy with result. 3:31. Kept an avg 5:00min/km. 


Background-
Casual runner, mostly around twice a week - mainly socially. Previously I had enjoyed hilly trail runs and a few half marathons over the last 3 years. Half marathons were 1:45 (2021), 1:38 (2022) and 2:10 +700m (2024). 

Peak training weeks volume: 60km prior to a taper. See third pic for training plan. 
Pre race Garmin predictor: 3:20, Strava: 3:36


Gear-
Ear pods, nipple tape, Garmin 955, spibelt performance, new balance fuel cell rebel v4. 


Race report-
Slept like a baby overnight (8hours), got up 1.5 hours before the race for a coffee and crumpets with jam and honey. Sipped a Powerade and smashed a banana just pre race. During the race had around 60g of carbs /hr- carried a 500ml flash with 50g cheap carb powder and a pinch of salt for first hour, 3 gels for the next 1.5 hour, and swapped out for another flask for final hour. Topped up with snake lollies. 
Felt strong and comfortable for 35kms, just doing through motions and enjoying the atmosphere. Slight ankle pain and moderate hip flexor pain set in after that, and each km felt like a challenge. Crowds cheering everyone on helped the final 2kms. 

Enjoyed a post run burger and beer. 
Painful until around 48 hours post race. 


Training-

1m0yb5f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0yb5f,My First Impression of the Pesado HD Shower Screen & Pesado HE High Extraction Basket VS IMS Precision Shower Screen & VST Filter Basket,"So I bought both the PesDo High Extraction 58.8 filter basket 17-19g and the HD Shower Screen. Surprisingly, the Pesado did a lot more to improve the flavor and the body than the shower screen! 

The water output was definitely improved by changing from the VST Precision Double Portafilter Basket to the Pesado High Extraction Filter Basket, and the taste is slightly sweeter, more body, and more layered flavorful overall.  You can see the difference with how the water comes out in the photos below.

Strangely, I felt there was a step back in flavor when I changed the IMS Precision Screen (CI 200) to the Pesado HD Shower Screen. Sure it looks prettier, but the IMS Screen was already pretty uniformed.

The taste is less sweet and there's a bit less intensity of flavor. I switched from the Coava Java Papatog medium roast to a darker Atlas Uganda coffee and I was the same thing. Overall better taste with the IMS screen + Pesado HE basket compared o the Pesado HD screen + Pesado HE Basket. The worst is the IMS screen + VST basket.

You were just starting to forget.

¬†You never replied to that last message.  
But it didn‚Äôt matter.  
Some things don‚Äôt need responses.  
They just wait.  
Quietly.  
Under your skin.

¬†It had been nearly a week.  
You‚Äôd almost convinced yourself it didn‚Äôt affect you.

And maybe it didn‚Äôt.  
At least not out loud.

But now you‚Äôre standing at the kitchen bench,  
fingers wrapped around your coffee,  
scrolling through notifications  
when the music shifts.

¬†Strings.  
Low. Slower than you remember.

It‚Äôs *Mad About You*, but not the usual version.  
Live.  
Hooverphonic, maybe.  
It sounds like it was performed for someone in particular.

That first note stirs something you thought had settled.  
And just like that, he‚Äôs back.

Not the message.  
Him.

And before the first verse lands,  
you‚Äôre not in your kitchen anymore.

You‚Äôre there again.

¬†Three soft knocks.

You open the door.

He doesn‚Äôt speak.  
He just walks in, brushing past you,  
his presence calm and deliberate.  
Like he‚Äôs already in your head.

Behind you now, his voice low:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been playing it in your head all week.‚Äù

He turns you to face the wall.  
Hands on your hips.  
Breath at your neck.

That version of *Mad About You* still playing somewhere in your mind,  
slow and haunting.

¬†His hand presses to your lower back.  
Not forceful. Just steady.

Then lower  
fingertips grazing the back of your knee.  
You flinch. Slightly.

He pauses. Smiles.

‚ÄúYou like when someone knows the right places, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

¬†

You can‚Äôt answer. Your body already has.

He traces your spine.  
Your breath stalls.  
One palm slides up your side, then both hands cradle your ribs.

‚ÄúYou said you like hands,‚Äù he murmurs.  
‚ÄúSo I paid attention.‚Äù

Your body leans into him now.  
Back arched.  
Breath shallow.

¬†This isn‚Äôt pressure.  
It‚Äôs presence.

And then it returns  
that familiar heat.

Sweat gathers at the small of your back.  
You recognise it.

Not from the room.  
From *him*.

¬†That same slow burn he left you with the first time  
the kind that only happens when two bodies hold back, then give in.  
And right now, you‚Äôre somewhere in between.

You feel it slide along your ribs.  
Your breath catches.  
And that‚Äôs when you realise:

This isn‚Äôt just physical.  
It‚Äôs personal.  
  
This is the kind of pleasure that‚Äôs mutually exclusive.  
Not shared. Not guessed. Not casual.

It‚Äôs curated.  
Just for you.

His fingertips move again, slow and certain,  
and just as you start to fall,

¬†The kettle clicks.

You blink.

The kitchen returns.  
Mug in your hand.  
Coffee lukewarm.  
Feet pressed to cool tile.

Your skin still damp with the echo of what almost was.

¬†That same live version of *Mad About You* by Hooverphonic still plays,  
soft and slow, like it knows what you just felt.

You breathe out slowly,  
but the weight of him doesn‚Äôt leave right away.

Because even if you won‚Äôt admit it:  
You‚Äôre listening for that knock.  
And your mind, warm and wide open again,  
starts to drift toward a single thought.

¬†*What if next time‚Ä¶ you didn‚Äôt want to wake up?*  
*What if this wasn‚Äôt just a memory‚Ä¶ but a beginning all over again?*",1,1752625000.0,softslowhardfast,0,1.0,False

1m0y9k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1m0y9k5/rate_your_coffee_subscriptions/,Rate your coffee subscription(s),"Subscriptions are super important for small coffee roasters. They give roasters some financial security and allow them to make bigger bets on buying harder to get, more expensive greens. I also feel the best way to really get to know a roaster is to become a subscriber. Trying a bag or two is one thing, even a few bags a year, but if you consistently get their roasts month after month, you really get to know them - and you dial in how to best brew their style of roast.  

With the above said - I‚Äôd love to hear what roaster(s) you‚Äôre subbed to, and how you‚Äôd rate the subscription. I‚Äôll go first. 

1. Luminous - 10/10. Mason was always a solid roaster, but ever since he moved over to Typhoon roasters (he‚Äôs the US distributor as well) he has been cranking out nothing but bangers. The technology in them is very unique and all of his roasts now are SUB 5 minutes! I particularly like how  he also provides meaningful instructions. He has diagrams explaining the profile of the roast, he provides a specific card for each coffee telling you how many days from roast to start drinking it and when it finish it by, and he actually provides brewing instructions that are specific/exact/unique to each coffee and so far they‚Äôve always been bang on. If you follow his instructions - as long as you don‚Äôt completely flub the grind (anything around 650 micron has been great for me) you get an absolute banger from the first cup. I also appreciate how unique his offerings are - he brings something unique to a very saturated market, and I look forward to his deliveries more than any other. I didn‚Äôt like processed coffees before Luminous and was a pretty ‚Äúwashed or die‚Äù loyalist, but he absolutely took me to the dark side. If you haven‚Äôt tried his beans, or you haven‚Äôt tried them since he shifted over to 100% typhoon roasts - you‚Äôre missing out.  He‚Äôs got a Cold Ferment Ecuador Sidra right now that is absolutely knocking my dad-gummed socks off and the Pink Champagne Washed Columbian Catiope he just ran out of - might be my coffee of the year, and is the only coffee I can recall that I rebought from a roaster‚Ä¶ multiple times. I also appreciate that he considers his customers extended family - and when they hit key milestones (personal and professional) he not only shares it with his customers - but he often includes substantial freebies/gifts which make you feel like you‚Äôre part of the celebration, and hey - who doesn‚Äôt like extra stuff?

2. Flower Child - 9.5/10. Absolutely rock solid washed coffees that honor the terroir. As stupid as it sounds - his beans tend to taste a lot like Sey - but with a bit more soul. Prestin‚Äôs style tends to offer a bit more fidelity and complexity over the more clinical Sey - and I‚Äôve found his roasts to be more consistently satisfying. When you pair his beans with a high clarity grinder that has somebody to it, like for instance a Pietro - it makes for an incredibly unctuous experience. He‚Äôs the cask strength scotch of third wave washed coffee roasters. The subs are a solid value (especially the 4 bagger) and if you ever shoot him any questions - he‚Äôs an incredibly nice and authentic guy. 

3. September - 5/10. They get a full points for their coffee, which has been exceptional in my experience - but the actual subscription is entirely pointless. The price of the sub is about the price of the beans they send - the only benefits were 1. Free shipping (which you get anyway if you spend $65+) 2. A 10% discount on squall bags - which if you buy are sent in the next months sub if you want free shipping (unless you‚Äôre buying over $65 worth after discount) 3. A custom third wave water packet formula. Now #1 is kind of a ‚Äúwho cares?‚Äù since they offer free shipping with only a $19 greater spend than the cost of the sub (and you get more coffee, you get what you want, and you can buy discounted garage sale bags). #2 is fine, but not super compelling - if you get 1 or 2 extra bags a month you‚Äôre looking at $3-6 in savings on those. #3 was pretty low value, as a full strength TWW packet is ~$1.41 a piece and even if we assume their half strength mix is worth the same - it‚Äôs moot. Why? Well - I just got this months sub in the mail yesterday - and no TWW packet. Reading their ‚Äúmonthly magazine‚Äù I was shocked to read they‚Äôre no longer including them, due to cost. This month‚Äôs bags cost $43 if bought a la carte, and the sub cost is $46 - so the math doesn‚Äôt math, and now you don‚Äôt even get a water packet? I cancelled my sub. I‚Äôll now cherry pick their coffees when it suits me, but I see no value/reason to subscribe. I replaced their sub, with the Prodigal Premium Sub - so we‚Äôll see how that goes, but I‚Äôve been getting 1-2 bags of their premium roasts almost even month this year, and they‚Äôve all been exceptional. 

4. Rogue Wave - 9/10. I‚Äôm only one month in, so take this with a grain of salt, but I got some of their coffee with my Femobook A4Z and was quite impressed, ordered some more - and was even more impressed, signed up for the sub, got the first months coffee‚Äôs and the ‚Äúimpressed‚Äù trend escalated yet again - and now I‚Äôve ordered some of their Panama Gesha. All 7 coffees I‚Äôve had from them so far have been extremely good, and frankly the math doesn‚Äôt really math given their value. $36 shipped for 24oz (two 340gr bags) of premium coffee - plus an extra 40gr sample, and you can ‚Äúbuild your own‚Äù subscription and outline what styles of coffee you want. With the low price - you expect it to be good, but assume it will be a step down from the ultra premo hyped up roasters - but so far in my experience it has been anything but. In fact, I find their roasts better and more consistent than some of the most expensive roasters here in the US. These guys are a head scratcher for me, they‚Äôve been around for 10 years, so they‚Äôre not new to the scene, but I‚Äôm a little surprised folks aren‚Äôt talking them up non-stop on here. The only reason they didn‚Äôt get a 10, is I‚Äôm new to them and perhaps they‚Äôre just having an amazing run right now - but if they keep up this level of quality and value - they‚Äôll be my ‚ÄúS-tier‚Äù pick. I‚Äôm not afraid of spending top dollar on good beans‚Ä¶ but if someone is putting out as good or better product for a literal fraction of the cost - only a fool wouldn‚Äôt jump on that train. For a mere $36 - it‚Äôs pretty hard not to jump on board in my opinion. 

TBD - Prodigal Premium. As I mentioned I just signed up for them (replacing September) but they‚Äôve been killing it with all the premium Gesha‚Äôs and COE winners I‚Äôve had from them this year. I have noticed - some of their roasts have taken awhile to come alive (one took two months) but with time they‚Äôve all been bangers - so they‚Äôre getting tapped in. Would love to hear any current subscribers thoughts here. 

So what are your subs, and how would you rate them?",3,1752624910.0,pourover,3,0.71,False
1m0y8wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1m0y8wc/do_i_have_pvd/,Do I have PVD?,"TLDR: experience diarrhea often. thought I had IBS, but now think its PVD. How can I tell for sure and what are the steps to fix?

For several years, I used to have a fear of pooping in public. So, I would drink coffee, no matter how late in the day, in order to stimulate a  BM. Then, I would sit in the bathroom and force myself to go.

Not thinking this was a problem, I started to think I had IBS. I was experiencing symptoms of frequent bowel movements every day with lots of diarrhea too. I also felt after every BM, I had more left in me but it wouldn‚Äôt come out (incomplete excavation).

Flash forward to recently putting two and two together, I considered I had PVD instead of IBS. Using chatgpt (my savior), I asked it so many questions about my symptoms. Most notably, I asked, ‚ÄúIf I feel pressure in my rectum for a BM, but no abdominal pressure, should I use the restroom?‚Äù ChatGPT said no, that means the BM isnt ready yet. At that point I realized, I have always went to the bathroom before my body was ready.

Additionally, I never experience real abdominal pain that a lot of IBS sufferers experience. So thats just another check in the possibly PVD column.

I still experience significant diarrhea often. To fix this, I take loperamide (Imodium) daily. I have had great experience when taking it every morning. But I‚Äôm really not sure whether I have PVD, IBS, or both, if I continue to experience diarrhea despite only going to the bathroom when my body feels ‚Äúready‚Äù to go.

Has anyone had similar experience? Any advice? This has been an issue for probably 7 years and I cannot get it fixed.",1,1752624856.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

You feel it every day. A persistent, bone-deep fatigue that coffee can‚Äôt touch. A mental fog that makes clear thoughts feel like a luxury. You‚Äôre gaining weight despite your best efforts, you‚Äôre always cold, and maybe you‚Äôre noticing more hair in the shower drain than usual. You know something is wrong.

So you do the responsible thing. You go to the doctor, get your blood tested, and wait for answers. The results come back: ‚ÄúYour TSH is normal. Everything looks fine.‚Äù

This is perhaps the most frustrating moment in the modern health journey. You are armed with a list of debilitating symptoms, yet faced with data that claims you are healthy. You read countless articles and forum posts. One says to avoid gluten and goitrogens like broccoli. Another says to load up on iodine. A third warns that iodine is dangerous and you should focus on selenium. The noise is deafening, the advice is contradictory, and you‚Äôre left with a cabinet full of supplements and no real way to know if any of them are helping.

This cycle of guesswork, conflicting information, and wasted effort is exhausting. You feel stuck, unheard, and powerless. But what if there was a different way? What if you could move beyond the confusing anecdotes and build a clear, data-driven picture of your own thyroid health?

# Why ""Normal"" Isn't Always Optimal: The Thyroid Puzzle

Your thyroid is the master regulator of your body's metabolism. This small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck produces hormones that influence nearly every cell in your body, controlling everything from your heart rate and body temperature to your energy production and cognitive function.

The key players in this system are:

* **TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone):** Produced by the pituitary gland, TSH tells your thyroid to make more hormones. A high TSH can indicate your thyroid is struggling (hypothyroidism).
* **T4 (Thyroxine):** The primary, but mostly inactive, hormone produced by the thyroid.
* **T3 (Triiodothyronine):** The active thyroid hormone. Your body must convert T4 into T3 for it to be used by your cells. This conversion process is critical.

The problem with standard testing is twofold. First, it often only measures TSH. Second, the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lab range for these markers is incredibly broad, based on a sick population average. Many people feel their worst at the edges of this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range. A **Health Optimizer** isn't interested in being ‚Äúnot clinically sick‚Äù; they are interested in being **truly optimal**.

To get a complete picture, you need to look beyond TSH. A comprehensive view includes:

* **Key Biomarkers:**
   * TSH
   * Free T4 (the amount of T4 available for conversion)
   * Free T3 (the amount of active hormone available to your cells)
   * Reverse T3 (an inactive form of T3 that can block active T3)
   * Thyroid Antibodies (TPO and TgAb, to check for autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's)
* **Key Subjective Effects:**
   * Energy Level
   * Brain Fog / Mental Clarity
   * Mood
   * Body Temperature
   * Weight Changes
   * Hair Loss
   * Sleep Quality

# The Frustration of Disconnected Data

Right now, where does all this information live? Your lab results are in a PDF from your doctor. Your notes about feeling tired are in a random app on your phone. Your diet changes are a mental note. Your supplement regimen is just the collection of bottles on your counter.

This fragmentation is the enemy of progress. You can't see the connections. Did your Free T3 improve after you started taking selenium? Did your energy levels crash every time you ate gluten? Did that new stress-reduction technique have any impact on your thyroid antibodies?

Without a system to connect your actions to your outcomes, you are flying blind. You are stuck in a loop of trial and error, unable to build on your experiences or learn from your own biology.

# The Paradigm Shift: From Guesswork to Personal Evidence

To break this cycle, you need to adopt a new mindset. You must become the lead researcher in the study of you. This requires a shift from passively receiving advice to actively generating personal evidence. It‚Äôs about transforming your scattered data points into a coherent intelligence dashboard.

Imagine a system where you could:

1. **Effortlessly centralize** every piece of your health puzzle in one place.
2. **Visually correlate** your lifestyle choices with your lab results and daily symptoms.
3. **Learn from the structured data** of thousands of others on a similar journey.

This isn't about replacing your doctor. It's about transforming your doctor's appointments from a 10-minute consultation into a data-rich, collaborative strategy session. It's about giving you the tools to finally understand the unique patterns of your own body.

# Building Your Thyroid Intelligence Dashboard with Staqc

This new paradigm is exactly why Staqc was built. It‚Äôs the platform designed to turn the chaos of health management into a clear, actionable ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how you can use it to take control of your thyroid health, step-by-step.

# Step 1: Centralize Your Data in Seconds

The first barrier to overcome is the sheer hassle of data entry. Manually typing dozens of biomarker values from a lab report into a spreadsheet is tedious and prone to error. With Staqc, this friction disappears.

Using the **Unified Health Logging** feature, you can consolidate everything. The standout tool here is the **AI-Powered Entry**. Simply copy the text from your lab report PDF, paste it into the Staqc chatbot, and watch as it automatically identifies, parses, and logs every single biomarker‚ÄîTSH, Free T4, Free T3, antibodies, and more‚Äîin under 10 seconds. You can log years of past results to establish a baseline. Alongside your labs, you can log your daily subjective scores for ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrain Fog,‚Äù and note the start dates for interventions like ‚ÄúGluten-Free Diet‚Äù or ‚ÄúStarted Selenium 200mcg.‚Äù For the first time, all your data lives in one place.

# Step 2: Visualize Cause and Effect

Once your data is centralized, the magic happens. The **Timeline View of Your Biomarkers, Effects, and Routines** turns your static numbers into a dynamic story. This is where you connect the dots.

Let's say your primary goal is to improve the conversion of T4 to T3. You can pull up a graph of your ‚ÄúFree T3‚Äù levels over the past year. Staqc automatically overlays this graph with event bands showing the exact periods you were on a specific diet or taking a certain supplement. You might see a clear, undeniable upward trend in your Free T3 that started just weeks after you began taking selenium and zinc. You can then overlay your subjective ‚ÄúEnergy Level‚Äù score on the same graph and see if it rose in lockstep with your Free T3. This visual evidence is profoundly more powerful than a vague feeling. It‚Äôs your personal data telling you what works.

# Step 3: Research Smarter with Crowdsourced Data

You‚Äôre not alone on this journey. But sifting through chaotic forums for reliable information is inefficient. Staqc‚Äôs **Crowdsourced Health Database** replaces random anecdotes with structured, aggregated data.

Before trying a supplement like Ashwagandha, which is often recommended for stress and thyroid support, you can look it up in Staqc. You‚Äôll see real-world statistics based on our entire user base. For instance, you might find that 60% of users who log Ashwagandha also report ‚ÄúImproved Sleep Quality,‚Äù but 15% report ‚ÄúStomach Upset.‚Äù More importantly, you can see how it's correlated with specific biomarkers. This allows you to make an informed decision based on population-level data, not just one person's opinion. You can even use the ‚ÄúSimilar Users‚Äù feature to discover what protocols are being used by others with a health profile that overlaps with yours.

# Step 4: Get Your Personalized Action Plan

After tracking for a while, it can still be challenging to synthesize all the information. The **Personalized AI Health Analyst** acts as your on-demand data scientist.

You can generate a report that analyzes your entire log history. The AI might highlight key findings, such as: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve detected a strong negative correlation between your logged alcohol consumption and your ‚ÄòSleep Quality‚Äô score on the following day. Your Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio has improved by 20% since you began your daily 20-minute meditation practice.‚Äù It cuts through the noise to deliver clear, data-driven recommendations tailored specifically to you, helping you refine your strategy for optimal health.

# A Practical Example: Optimizing T4 to T3 Conversion

Let‚Äôs put it all together in a real-world scenario.

* **The Person:** Sarah feels tired and foggy. Her TSH and T4 are ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù but her Free T3 is at the very bottom of the lab range.
* **The Goal:** Improve her body's conversion of inactive T4 to active T3.
* **The Research (Staqc):** Sarah uses the **Crowdsourced Health Database** to research ‚ÄúFree T3.‚Äù She sees that many users have successfully linked it with Selenium and Zinc supplementation. She also notices that many users with low T3 avoid gluten.
* **The Action (Staqc):** Sarah decides to start a new protocol: ‚ÄúSelenium 200mcg + Zinc 15mg daily‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrict Gluten-Free Diet.‚Äù She logs the start dates for both using **Unified Health Logging**. She also uses the **AI-Powered Entry** to log her past two years of lab results and commits to logging her daily ‚ÄúEnergy Level‚Äù and ‚ÄúMental Clarity‚Äù scores.
* **The Analysis (Staqc):** Three months later, after her next blood test, she logs the new results. She opens her **Timeline View**. The visual is stunning. Her Free T3 levels show a clear upward trend that began about a month after she started her new protocol. Even more motivating, her charts for ‚ÄúEnergy Level‚Äù and ‚ÄúMental Clarity‚Äù show a nearly identical upward climb. The visual proof is undeniable.
* **The Refinement (Staqc):** To confirm her findings, she generates a **Personalized AI Health Analyst** report. The report flags the strong positive correlation between her new protocol and her improved biomarkers and subjective feelings, giving her the confidence to continue.

# Conclusion

Managing your thyroid health does not have to be a journey defined by confusion and guesswork. The fatigue, brain fog, and frustration you feel are real, but you are not powerless. By shifting your approach from relying on scattered anecdotes to building your own personal evidence base, you can become the architect of your own health.

By systematically tracking your biomarkers, symptoms, and lifestyle interventions, you can uncover the unique cause-and-effect relationships within your own body. You can finally get clear answers to the question, ‚ÄúIs this working for me?‚Äù This is the path from feeling like a passive patient to becoming an empowered, data-driven Health Optimizer.

It should be luminous enough to showcase your goods in a flattering light without generating excessive heat. consider models with adjustable lighting or different color temperature options to fine-tune the presentation.**Construction and Materials:** The durability and hygiene of a pastry display case depend heavily on its construction and materials. Stainless steel is a popular choice for its corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, and sleek appearance. Tempered glass is essential for the display windows and shelves, offering superior strength and safety compared to regular glass. Ensure the case is well-sealed to prevent leaks and maintain consistent internal conditions.

**accessibility and Ease of Use:** A well-designed pastry display case should be easy to access for both staff and customers. Sliding or hinged doors should operate smoothly, and the interior should be well-organized for efficient stocking and retrieval. User-pleasant controls for temperature, humidity, and lighting are also essential. Look for models with features like automatic defrost and removable parts for simplified cleaning and maintenance.

## FAQs Section

Knowing the answers to common questions can help streamline the purchasing process.

**what size pastry display case do I need?**
The ideal size depends on the volume of pastries you plan to display and the available space in your establishment. Measure your available space carefully and consider the number of shelves and the capacity of each shelf. It is always best to overestimate slightly to accommodate future growth.

**What type of glass is best for a pastry display case?**
Tempered glass is the best option for pastry display cases.It is significantly stronger than regular glass and resists breakage. If it does break, it shatters into small, relatively harmless pieces, reducing the risk of injury.

**How often should I clean my pastry display case?**
You should clean your pastry display case daily to remove crumbs, spills, and fingerprints. Weekly deep cleaning, including sanitizing all surfaces and removing shelves, is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing the buildup of bacteria and mold. Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific cleaning recommendations.

**What is the appropriate temperature setting for a pastry display case?**
The ideal temperature range is typically between 36¬∞F and 46¬∞F (2¬∞C and 8¬∞C). However, the specific temperature may vary depending on the types of pastries you are displaying. Delicate pastries like cream-filled items may require a slightly cooler temperature than drier items like croissants.

My diet was EXTREMELY limited from December through April. Since then, I've tried some ""test"" foods, and most of them have gone well - McDonald's chicken nuggets and fries got a pass, sour cream donuts from whole foods, a marinara-less frozen cheese pizza and a handful of other mostly simple carbs. I seem to have no issue processing fat now either, as I'm eating 60-70g a day, which is how much I was consuming pre gastritis.

Every once in a while though, a test food will go inexplicably wrong. An easy example is a Siete brand frozen tortilla. The ingredients in the tortilla are ingredients I eat in other foods on a daily basis. But it made me SO sick and nauseous that it cost me 3 days of work. I tried it again a month later, same result. That was in April and then again in May.

I'm wondering, when did you start trying some of the more common triggers such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, coffee, etc? How did you decide to test out those foods? ",3,1752623899.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

\-Bedroom is available starting 9/1

\-Monthly rent is $1,156 plus utilities

\-She has a cat, so no other pets please

\-Rent-stabilized

ABOUT THE OPEN BEDROOM:

The bedroom is huge (17'x12.5'), has a closet, and gets great light 

ABOUT THE APARTMENT:

The apartment itself is a 3-bedroom on a quiet side street surrounded by lots of coffee shops, groceries, bars, delis, a library, etc. No laundry but there are multiple laundromat options right nearby. Note that because I'm moving out, some of the furniture in the common space will be different.

ABOUT THE ROOMMATES:

Your roommate will be a 27-year-old woman who's an NYC native and works in television. She spends a lot of her time writing, attending church and spending her weekends with her fiance and/or family. The other roommate is a very social and sweet 8-year-old tuxedo cat! Roommates are intentional about splitting up cleaning duties to make sure the house stays tidy throughout the week.

She (and the cat) is planning to move out in November for family reasons, so you would need to find someone for the third room at that time.

ABOUT YOU:

We‚Äôre looking for a roommate who is clean, considerate, and friendly (but doesn't bring the party home). Please be a fan of cats! You would apply with the management company.

I reckon by now you‚Äôve forgotten my name.

It don‚Äôt come as a surprise anymore. Not really. I can see it slip from your mouth before you even open it. You look at me like I‚Äôm a visitor just passing through, someone kind enough to sit with you a while. I bring you coffee, I mend your shirts, I speak your name softly. And still, nothing stirs behind those kind eyes of yours.

But Lord, you were once the sharpest man I knew. Could rope a steer in your sleep, carve a cradle for our baby girl without a single nail. You remembered every damn thing; birthdays, how I like my eggs, the way I cried at the sound of fiddles in the evening. Now you just sit real still by the window, hummin‚Äô songs you can‚Äôt name, starin‚Äô at the hills like they‚Äôre about to tell you somethin‚Äô.

You‚Äôve taken to painting lately.

It‚Äôs a strange thing, but you‚Äôve got these little canvases stacked in the barn. Always paint the same woman. She‚Äôs got brown eyes and a crooked smile, and there‚Äôs a scar on her chin where she fell off a horse long ago, just like I did when I was sixteen and you carried me home swearing like a preacher on fire.

You paint me, but you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me.

Sometimes I ask you who she is. You always say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rightly know. Just someone I reckon I loved once.‚Äù

I step outside when you say it, pretendin‚Äô I got chores to do. Truth is, I just need a place to fall apart where you won‚Äôt see.

I still brush your hair in the mornings. You flinch sometimes, like it‚Äôs unfamiliar, but then you settle. I think somewhere deep down, your hands remember mine. Maybe love like ours don‚Äôt vanish, it just gets buried under all the forgetting.

I miss you, even while you‚Äôre still here.

I talk to the Lord about you most nights. I ask him not to fix what can‚Äôt be fixed, but just to let me bear it with grace. I reckon that‚Äôs all I can do now. Be the woman you once knew, even if you can‚Äôt place her name.

Maybe someday, when we‚Äôre both dust, you‚Äôll find me again in some other life. Maybe then you‚Äôll look at me and say, ‚ÄúThere you are. I‚Äôve been lookin‚Äô.‚Äù

Until then, I‚Äôll sit by your side and hold your hand like a stranger who ain‚Äôt in no hurry to leave.

Yours, even if you don‚Äôt remember,

1m0xpxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1m0xpxf/i_cant_stand_my_fil_half_ranthalf_looking_for/,I can't stand my FIL -half rant/half looking for advice,"Help my marriage ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

This is a lot and I apologize in advance. 

My husband and I have been married almost 10 years and have a young child plus a baby on the way. My husband is one of 4 children and his parents are the only ones who live locally to us. For context, his parents are very conservative Christians (do not drink alcohol, very involved with pro-life things, etc) and we live in the south. They have very different fundamental views than my husband and I have. 

I find his father to be very self-serving, controlling, and unintentionally disrespectful. I do not think he does anything with a malicious intent. I believe he is used to being ""the man in charge"" and struggles with the transition of his role into retired grandfather. He's also just oblivious and stupid. I also don't think his kids have ever challenged him on things before and he's used to just being appeased. 

Some examples: 
* They do a beach trip every other year with the entire family. This involves my husband's parents, his siblings plus their families, and us. We occasionally have some of my husband's aunts/uncles come as well. I had an incident a few years ago where my daughter was a baby and I was with his family alone at the beach (husband was working and planned to join us a few days later). I was strictly formula feeding and realized I was going to run out. I did not have a car to get to the grocery store. My SIL also did not have a car but borrowed my FIL's car every morning to go on her coffee run. I asked my FIL if I could borrow the car to get formula and he basically said I could use a different formula that my SIL had and heavily implied that I couldn't use the car. Thankfully my husband's uncle saw how distressed I was and drove me to the store. 
* He likes to make long winded speeches at big family dinners even when there are multiple small kids who just want to eat. He then gets upset if the kids make too much noise while he's talking about whatever it is that he wants to talk about in said speech. 
* The entire family is expected to come to a specified holiday every year. It rotates between Thanksgiving and Christmas. This ends up being 7+ days of all of the siblings plus their families hanging out at his parents house. It is A LOT. His father makes a detailed schedule of activities for every minute of the day. For example: 3-4pm: kids play outside in backyard, 4pm-5pm: Christmas caroling, 5pm-6pm: dinner, etc. The micromanaging drives me NUTS. It's also things that he wants to do. One year he wanted to play kickball. The kids did not want to play at all but my BIL basically forced them to play so that FIL was happy. I think my nephew even got punished for not playing. This has been a sore spot for me for years and after much discussion they are very careful to label all the activities as ""optional."" Except my FIL will get a huge attitude if we politely decline. It is a lot for me to handle and always ends up with my husband and I fighting. 

This brings me to present day. My SIL and her family recently came to visit for 9 days around 4th of July. It was meant to be more of a visit for us and my SIL's family, but they chose to stay with my inlaws (they bought a house several years ago that is huge with the intention that all their kids plus families could stay). At one point we (my family and my SIL's family) decided to go to a local splash pad. My husband asked at the last minute if my MIL and FIL could come. I said sure. My husband had to show up late due to work so I said I would meet them there. There is limited seating around the splash pad so I immediately snagged a table where we could watch the kids play. When my inlaws got there, my FIL saw me, did not say anything to me, and immediately started looking for a better table with more shade. He did not ask for my input at all and ended up at a table way across the park where you can't view the splash pad. He fully expected all of us to end up at that table with him. I wouldn't have been as mad if I wasn't already sitting at a table with all of my stuff spread out. The pregnancy rage took over at the disrespect and I went by myself to a different location to watch my daughter until my husband got there. A few days later we were at my inlaws house and he asked us to paint rocks with him. We just got done doing tie-dye as a group so we politely declined for ourselves but mentioned how our daughter might want to. As soon as we started saying no, he immediately walked away, ignored us, and slammed the door to his garage. Later on that day my husband and I were at their dining room table looking up parking for the park my FIL wanted to go to. My FIL came out of no where and asked very aggressively if we think he pushes us around. I was extremely uncomfortable and my husband told him this wasn't the place/time to have this convo. My FIL just repeated the question. My husband then tried to get him to move into his office so they could have the convo without me. His FIL demanded it be the three of us. My husband eventually got him to go to the office and I immediately got our daughter and went to the car. His father could not understand how he came off was aggressive/confrontational. I have not seen or spoken to them since. 

So now my husband wants me to speak with his parents to smooth things over. This has been a source of contention between my husband and I since the fourth. Maybe it's the pregnancy hormones or the years of bullshit adding up, but I'm done. I am tired of fighting with my husband every holiday because I can't stand being around his family basically 24/7 for a week. I'm tired of not enjoying my holidays because I'm doing whatever my FIL wants us to do. I am taking back my holidays. I've told my husband he is welcome to see his family as much as he wants and his siblings are more than welcome to come hang out at our house when they're in town. I love my husband and want him to spend time with his family. I do not want to make this into a ""choose me or them"" scenario, but I can't continue to be miserable and need to put up a boundary for myself. This makes me sad as I know I'll be alone now for the majority of the time surrounding holidays. 

If I do have this conversation with his parents, how do I tell them I have a fundamental issue with my FIL's personality? I just don't see how this will be productive as I don't expect him to change. I also don't want them to pretend things will change and then me be in the same situation come next holiday. My husband has had conversations with them in the past about the schedules and other little things. The biggest thing that changed were the activities becoming ""optional"" but his behavior shows that isn't the case.  

Am I crazy?? Are these week long benders with large families normal? Should I just suck it up for the sake of my husband and kids and continue to be miserable during the holidays? I just don't understand how to find a happy middle between appeasing my husband and keeping my sanity. ",4,1752623427.0,inlaws,7,1.0,False

I recently was diagnosed with ADD in my late 20s and my provider was insistent about modafinil as my starting medication at 100mg. I‚Äôve read plenty of things and this is my first ever medication like this in general. (Never seen by behavioral health before)

1. Has anyone experienced issues with appetite?

2. I wake up at 4am and sleep at 9pm, is that going to be long enough to kill the half life? My provider wasn‚Äôt very helpful with questions.

3. I drink coffee daily and have read people have mixed reviews, any suggestions?

4. I use preworkout, small doses at max 100mg of caffeine at a time. Should I back off it?

I have a situation that I would like to share and ask for advice about.



I am a young man with a girlfriend of three years. We have a healthy, trusting relationship and solve any problems together. We always support each other and know how each of us reacts to certain situations. We invest in our relationship.



Recently, we both wanted to try something new in bed. By ""something new,"" I mean a third person. Before that, we had hardly ever discussed the possibility, but a couple of weeks ago, we both agreed that we wanted to try it.



We quickly found the person we wanted to invite to our bed - it was a mutual friend of ours. Let's call him Mike. It should be noted that Mike is a trans man and I am bisexual, so it was not a problem. Mike is much shyer about such matters, so it would be up to us to take the lead.



It all started with jokes about threesomes, which we all found funny. However, we all know that every joke is only half a joke.



One night, the three of us got together at my apartment. We had a few drinks and decided to play spin the bottle. In this game, each person spins an empty bottle in turn and has to kiss the person the bottle points to when it stops.



It started with just kisses on the cheek and lips, but soon turned into real tongue kisses. We all kissed, and none of us felt jealous because we all wanted to. It didn't go any further, and then we went to bed.



We shared a bed, but my girlfriend wanted to sleep alone, so she slept on the couch while Mike and I stayed in the bed. Unlike the girl, who instantly fell asleep, we couldn't fall asleep for a long time.



We lay there, whispering and discussing how the day had gone and other uninteresting things. I knew Mike liked me, and, to be honest, I liked him, too. At some point, I kissed him on the cheek. It wasn't a conscious decision - it was the atmosphere, the fact that we were lying next to each other, and something I just wanted to do.



He reacted calmly, kissing my cheek back. It didn't seem unusual because, just an hour earlier, we had kissed with our tongues. But we didn't stop there. In a moment, we were kissing passionately. Neither of us felt like we were doing anything wrong, it felt natural, like we had done it a hundred times before.



My girlfriend was sleeping next to us during this, and I thought, ""I wish she could be part of this now."" It would be pointless to wake her up just to kiss her, especially since she would probably just roll over to the other side.



I want to reiterate that I didn't think we were doing anything wrong. I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't realize it at the time. My logic was simple: We had kissed before, so it was nothing new. Besides, I put myself in my girlfriend's shoes. To be honest, I would have liked to find out that she and Mike had kissed. I'm not cuckold, and I like Mike, so I wouldn't have minded that scenario.



The next morning, Mike went out for coffee while we stayed at my place. After he left, I decided to tell my girlfriend what had happened the night before. I didn't feel guilty or make excuses. I just calmly told her what had happened. The reaction I got was much different from what I expected, though.



She immediately got angry with me, saying that I shouldn't have kissed Mike because the three of us had enjoyed kissing each other before. But when I kissed Mike, it was just the two of us. To say that I was surprised by this reaction is an understatement.



I know it sounds like I'm a jerk, but at the time, I viewed the situation very differently. The girl was offended and refused to talk to me. I was stunned by her reaction because I didn't expect it. She said that she felt like I had cheated on her. At that moment, I realized what I had done.



I realized how she saw the situation, and I felt stupid. Mike came with coffee, and she decided to pretend that nothing had happened. However, for the rest of the day, she hardly spoke to me and instead talked to Mike. In the evening, after Mike left for his place and we were alone, I apologized profusely. I swore that I didn't mean it and fully explained my perspective, but she ridiculed my point of view. In fact, she was completely justified. She went home. We don't live together because we both study, and it's not geographically convenient.



I wrote her many apologies and promised that it wouldn't happen again, but she wasn't convinced.



The next day, I went to talk to her. We talked a lot about our relationship, our past, and whether we had a future together. She said that she couldn't forgive me that quickly and that she needed time. She also said that she didn't want to talk to Mike at all. I felt like I had destroyed everything I had built up for so long because the three of us got along so well. All I wanted was for that night never happens, and for everything to go back to normal.



As the days went on, my girlfriend became less angry with me. It's been a week and a half since that day. She still gets angry and jealous with me every time I mention Mike. She doesn't talk to him at all and doesn't like that I still talk to him.



She says she wants everything to be like it used to be. However, she can't change how she feels. She's incredibly jealous of Mike. When I told Mike about all this, he felt ashamed and angry with himself for what had happened. He was afraid that we would stop talking to him because we have been friends for a long time and he doesn't have any other friends.



I feel like I am the only one to blame for everything that happened. I kissed him first. I started it all, and I have to end it. I just don't know how.



I wish things could go back to the way they were before, when the three of us were having a good time. I value Mike as a friend and don't want to stop talking to him. It would be easier for my girlfriend to cut all ties and move on.



I have to resolve this. I feel like the three of us need to talk. But I'm scared to death of it. I actually think this dialogue could destroy our relationship. Mike is very private and never talks about his feelings, so this kind of conversation is his weakest point. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is quite expressive and explosive, which often works against her. I'm afraid this conversation will break any ties between Mike and me and worsen our relationship with my girlfriend.



I don't know how else to handle this because I'm the one who has to do it. My girlfriend would rather forget about Mike than work things out because she discards people easily and ends communication quickly if she's not satisfied. Mike would rather jump off a roof than start this dialogue, let alone take responsibility for its outcome.



I'm at a crossroads, feeling confused and uncertain about what to do. I'm looking for help and am ready to answer any additional questions. Thank you in advance.",1,1752623370.0,u_Constant-Space-6888,1,1.0,False

The video was done by a British four-piece rock band. The lead singer looked exactly like Daniel Radcliffe in his Harry Potter role. The video takes place in an old-fashioned house inhabited by a lone, meek, nerdy office worker. The members of the band stand here and there, performing their instruments, unseen by the office worker. This main character is shown every day getting up, going to work, stopping off at a convenience store, and buying a lottery ticket and a coffee. He goes to work where he is bullied and under appreciated by all his office mates. He looks miserable. One day there‚Äôs a big holiday office party, and no one pays attention to him and everyone makes fun of him. Well, that night, while watching TV in his bed, he finds out he wins the big sweepstakes. He never has to work again if he claims his ticket. You think the next day he‚Äôs going to claim his ticket and tell everyone to bug off. But no, he stays up all night in bed thinking. He then goes to the convenience store, and just when you think he‚Äôs going to claim his prize, he just buys a coffee, then proceeds to work, where he is presumably working that day on a Saturday. Why? He was afraid to claim his prize because he‚Äôs too comfortable with his life, even its loneliness and misery. How depressing!

1m0xjyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m0xjyl/what_size_patio_do_you_need_for_a_table_and_chairs/,What size patio do you need for a table and chairs?,"When it comes to setting up your outdoor space, figuring out the right size patio for your table and chairs can be tricky. I've been through this process myself and want to share what I've learned to help you plan your perfect patio setup.

First things first, you need to think about how many people you want to accommodate. A small bistro set for two needs way less space than a big dining table for eight. As a general rule, plan for about 3 feet of space around the table for each chair. This gives people enough room to sit comfortably and move around.

For a basic 4-person table, you're looking at needing a patio area of at least 10 feet by 10 feet. This allows for the table itself (usually around 4 feet square) plus that crucial 3 feet of space around it. If you want to go bigger with a 6-person table, aim for a patio that's at least 12 feet by 12 feet.

But it's not just about the table and chairs. You'll want to think about other stuff too. Do you plan on having a grill out there? Maybe some potted plants or a small fire pit? Factor in extra space for these items to avoid a cramped feel.

I've found that having a bit more space than you think you need is always a good idea. It gives you room to add things later or rearrange your setup as needed. Plus, a slightly larger patio just feels more open and inviting.

When it comes to choosing the right patio furniture, I've had great luck with the selection at https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables. They have a wide range of options to fit different patio sizes and styles.

Remember, the shape of your table matters too. A round table often works better in smaller spaces because it doesn't have corners sticking out. Square or rectangular tables are great for larger patios and can seat more people.

Don't forget about traffic flow. You'll want to make sure people can easily walk around the table and chairs, even when they're being used. A good rule of thumb is to leave at least 4 feet of clear space for walkways.

If you're working with a smaller space, consider a table with leaves or extensions. This way, you can keep it compact for everyday use but expand it when you have guests over.

Lighting is another important factor. You'll want to be able to use your patio in the evening, so think about where you might put some outdoor lights or lanterns.

Lastly, consider the material of your patio furniture. If you live in an area with harsh weather, you'll want something durable that can withstand the elements. The folks at https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables have some great weather-resistant options that look good and last long.

Planning your patio size might seem like a lot of work, but trust me, it's worth it. A well-designed outdoor space can become your favorite spot to relax, entertain, or just enjoy a quiet cup of coffee in the morning. Take your time, measure carefully, and soon you'll have the perfect patio for your needs.",1,1752622980.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

*Reflecting on June 28th, 1972 (Part 2)*

*Her Eyes*

I tried distracting myself by looking through the smaller box that I also took. It looked like it was just a bunch of random items from a junk drawer that was dumped into the cardboard container. There were some fishing tackles, various coins, an old pipe that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been touched in over a decade. One of the strangest things in the box was a tin can that had a bunch of nails driven into it from the outside inward. I looked inside at the rows of nails that seemed to have some rusted red coloration. At the bottom of it was a small key that was a dull golden color. I had to gently and steadily shift the can around for the key to come out onto my hand. Putting it in my pocket, I shifted through some of the other miscellaneous items that could either give some clues around the hunt for L√≠ Ban or anything related. Besides a photo of his brother prepping a boat and a couple of short newspaper clippings around conspiracy theories of elite members of society, there was nothing of substance.

‚ÄúHey, tiger. We‚Äôre about to have dinner soon.‚Äù My dad‚Äôs voice from the doorway made me snap back to my surroundings. I looked at the window that was just full of daylight when I last checked, but it was now a dusky pink color. 

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll be heading down.‚Äù I sprung up almost robotically, pretending that all was well. 

‚ÄúDid you find anything interesting in that box?‚Äù my dad inquired.

‚ÄúNo, nothing! Don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù I said in almost a panicked tone. 

‚ÄúOkay, then. Well, head on down when you‚Äôre all ready.‚Äù My dad looked at me with a questioning look, accurately doubting my statement.

Almost like a knee-jerk reflex, I wanted to dodge and avoid any form of interrogation that could negatively affect those around me. I held onto the sentiment that if he didn‚Äôt want me to press about his drinking, he sure as hell knew to not pry in my own conundrum as we headed out in the hallway to go to the kitchen table. I looked back at Grandpa Sean‚Äôs bedroom door, taking in the deadbolt lock near the top that vaguely caught my interest when I first saw it. Seeing this gave me both more validation of his stories and even more questions. ‚ÄòWhen it was just him, how did he keep himself from getting out?‚Äô Although, thinking about the dark rust in the can and Grandpa‚Äôs skin on his hands looking like a tattered cloth, I shudder to think of the answer.

I can barely even remember what we ate, I could barely even focus on the chatter around me. All I could hear was the muffled sounds of Peter, Aunt Rowan, and Dad talking about what all they found going through their own boxes. I was rolling a pea around with my fork, my mind wrapped with worry about the state of my grandpa, my dad, and the existence of this Machiavellian creature. Where was she right now? Has she consumed someone recently to satiate her desire, or is her stomach once more grumbling as the skin around it is falling off into the depths below. 

‚ÄúJimmy! What did you find?‚Äù Peter yanked me out of the prison of my own mind.

‚ÄúJust some boring papers. Talking about fishing trips. Nothing really interesting.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDid he catch anything cool? Like a barracuda?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have the energy to entertain Peter‚Äôs excitement over something that was more twisted and horrible than any real fish could be. Peter pouted at my response and continued chatting with the others. I wished I could have just grabbed that horrid box and dumped it on the table, turning everyone‚Äôs lax attitude into the mind-numbing spiral that I did not want to be alone in. But I didn‚Äôt. What good would it have given me? Given them? Peter would just think it was a creepy story to tell his friends at school without the morbid realization of how it connects to Grandpa‚Äôs cursed life. Dad would either believe what his father wrote or conclude that he was always a mentally ill man that couldn‚Äôt play house with their family for too long before the intense delusions kicked in, either conclusion leading to him likely drinking himself to sleep for the foreseeable future. I wasn‚Äôt even sure what Aunt Rowan would think. Maybe she had some insight since both her brothers were involved with this mystic quest and trying to pick up the broken pieces of my grandfather‚Äôs sanity in the years that followed.

‚ÄúHey, Aunt Rowan?‚Äù I chimed in to the dying conversation they were having. Everyone was finished with their plates and it was a matter of time before she would leave for her house. I had to make my move. I needed to know if she knew anything that would help me wrap my head around what all I read and how it connected to Grandpa‚Äôs erratic behavior. 

‚ÄúYes dear?‚Äù Aunt Rowan chimed.

‚ÄúCan you come take a look at something upstairs? It looks like something that belongs to you?‚Äù I asked, hoping she would take my bait.

‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù she nodded enthusiastically, excited for a surprise that would never come.

We walked upstairs and into the room I was staying in. I pulled out a couple of documents and books from the box to see if they were recognizable to her. When she registered what she was looking at, I could tell that this was something eerily familiar to her. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for lying. I just-I just wanted to know what all this is and I thought you might have some answers.‚Äù I sheepishly looked at her, feeling regret wash over my body.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know much, and I don‚Äôt think I want to know. My brothers got obsessed with this legend. I want to‚Ä¶well maybe I do‚Ä¶believe them. The more they got involved, the more obsessed they got. I felt like I was slowly losing them.‚Äù She started tearing up while gently thumbing over the weathered notebook. 

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm sorry. I shouldn‚Äôt have brought this up.‚Äù I tried scrambling to take the notebook out of her hand, but she shook her head lightly.

‚ÄúLiam‚Äôs death hit us hard. Your grandpa, Sean, holed himself here. I tried getting your father to talk to him. Maybe it was selfish, but I thought your dad would be able to veer Sean‚Äôs head away from his relentless pursuit of that cursed fish-thing. I was so wrong, so very wrong. I think I made it worse.‚Äù Aunt Rowan‚Äôs tears started rolling down her plump, flushed cheeks as her lip quivered. I stiffly placed a hand on her shoulder, hoping my awkward teenage display of emotional comfort was enough to get her to calm down.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt even mention your dad‚Äôs name without Sean going crazy, telling me that she‚Äôs listening. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just gone mad or if whatever that thing is has something to do with it. But I don‚Äôt want him to go like that. I just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt know anymore.‚Äù Aunt Rowan quickly apologized as she wiped tears from her face. As she stood up and took a deep inhale, she turned to me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad Connor had wonderful sons of his own to love.‚Äù Patting my back, my great aunt walked down the stairs and announced her goodbyes for the night. 

After Aunt Rowan left, I felt a wave of exhaustion take over me. All of that reading must have overloaded my young mind with morbid fantasies. I put on my plaid pajama bottoms and t-shirt on, ready for bed. The strange thing was that Peter wasn‚Äôt in the room. I searched the top floor, but no sign. I went to the ground floor and looked around. My dad was sitting on the couch, mindlessly flipping through channels on the ancient television. 

‚ÄúHey Dad? Where‚Äôs Peter?‚Äù I asked, scanning the area. 

‚ÄúHe should be in the backyard. We found spyglasses in Grandpa‚Äôs room and he wanted to look out into the water. Can you go check on him? I told him to stay by the house.‚Äù My dad grumbled, nonchalantly triggering my panic response with the simple words of ‚Äòlook out into the water‚Äô. I bolted to the door, throwing it open to bring Peter back inside. I spotted his scrawny figure halfway down the hill towards the lake, holding the magnifying tube to his eye with fascination. 

‚ÄúGET INSIDE!‚Äù I shouted. I don‚Äôt know why I was this scared. Grandpa‚Äôs stories could‚Äôve been made up for all I knew, but something told me that it was a bad idea going anywhere near the water. I saw Peter‚Äôs frame jolt in surprise and turn around. He opened his mouth like he was going to protest, but I think he saw the vague outline of my tense form and clenched fists that the glow from the house poured around. He turned around and started to run up the hill when he slipped on the grass, spyglass flying out of his hand and rolling closer to the water. 

‚ÄúAh no Dad‚Äôs gonna kill me if I lose this!‚Äù he yelled as he scrambled towards the edge. I could‚Äôve shouted to leave it, but I knew that the thought of disappointing Dad was more terrifying to him than any warning I gave out. I was the same way too. 

I ran down the hill to go after him, to do anything to hurry up the process and get back to the house. He was on his hands and knees, swishing his hands across the grass to look for the glass in the dark night. I crouched down to look with him. The little light that the crescent moon provided was just enough to see the metallic reflection of the spyglass as it laid just a foot away from the lakeside. I grabbed it with a sigh of relief, but that sigh halted. Looking at the water in front of me, just around 8 feet out, were a pair of glistening balls of light that stared right into me. All sound around me muffled. Time stood completely still as I stared face to face with the aquatic woman that has plagued my family. The skin around her eye sockets was sagging like gelatin ready to fall off of her. I tried looking at anything but her eyes, but nothing would reach beyond the hypnotizing stare and a glimpse of the bloated monstrosity that is likely making up the rest of her body. 

‚Äújim‚Ä¶Jim‚Ä¶Jim!‚Äù my name started to echo louder and louder until I felt a hand pull me back. I turned around and saw my dad, who was catching his breath from probably sprinting to me. Peter was at the top of the hill. I could barely speak, just stared wide-eyed at my dad in a state of shock. ‚ÄúD-did you fall? Hit your head?‚Äù he was shifting my head around, inspecting for whatever cranial injury he determined was the cause of my state of catatonia. Gently tugging on my hand, he led me up the hill. Somehow I was able to have my legs carry me into the house. After mumbling to him that I‚Äôm just tired and that I didn‚Äôt hit my head on anything. ‚ÄòI just had something on my mind‚Äô was the only excuse I could muster before excusing myself to bed. 

In our bedroom, Peter and I were silent. Every movement I made was being steadily observed by my younger brother. Every time he noticed me looking back at him, he‚Äôd whip his neck the other way, acting as if he was not staring at me for the past 10 seconds. I eventually crawled into bed next to him. I could tell he was still awake, the tension in the air was palpable.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever do that again.‚Äù He finally spoke, words laced with worry and fear before he scrunched himself in a fetal position away from me.

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the lake. You-you were freaking me out.‚Äù He stated, voice slightly shaking.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do it on purpose. I don‚Äôt know what happened.‚Äù I spoke a half-truth. Another round of silence lingered before I asked ‚ÄúHow long was I standing there for?‚Äù

	‚ÄúAbout a minute or two. I looked up and you were super stiff. I couldn‚Äôt see what you were even looking at‚Ä¶Thought you were trying to spook me. You looked super creepy and I had to go get Dad.‚Äù He shuttered, pulling some more blanket for himself. ‚ÄúI hate when you roll your eyes to the back of your head, you know that freaks me out!‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy eyes were rolling back?‚Äù I was staring at her the whole time. My eyes never tore away from her.

‚ÄúYou were doing it the whole time! I thought you were faking it until I realized you were doing it too long to be a prank.‚Äù He turned his head back to face me. ‚ÄúI was worried. Please don‚Äôt get a seizure or something weird.‚Äù He pleaded like I somehow had control. 

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt. You‚Äôd be able to tell. If you feel any warm liquid on your leg, just know that people piss themselves when they have seizures.‚Äù I teasingly explained, trying to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúGood night, piss-sitter‚Äù, I flipped on my other side away from him as he whined with fear about getting a gross wake-up. Eventually, I could hear his light snoring as the minutes ticked by.

In truth, what Peter said frightened me. I was relieved that he didn‚Äôt lock eyes with her, but the fact that I repeated history with the simple act of one simple gaze filled me with a sense of dread that travelled from my throat to the pit of my stomach. The only thing going for me is that I was somewhat prepared, knowing that I can trap myself from sleepwalking outside. A sudden idea to test something came to me. I grabbed the key that I got from the nailed can and walked over to the door of Grandpa‚Äôs bedroom. I could tell that my dad was downstairs due to the kitchen light being on and the faint aroma of coffee wafting in the air. Although there was a sliding latch to lock from the outside, there was a lock on the inside doorknob of the bedroom. Sliding the key in, it clicked in place and moved the lock in and out. I tried the key on our bedroom door, but no such luck. I was unaware how advanced the sleepwalking was beyond simply opening the door or finding a key to unlock it, but apparently simply hiding the key wasn‚Äôt an option if he had to resort to mutilation to wake himself before grabbing it. It may sound foolish in hindsight, but I thought it would be a decent safety measure to prop the chair under the doorhandle as a barrier. It was the only thing I could think of at the time that wouldn‚Äôt involve having to tell the others about something even I cannot comprehend. When I reached the last step, I was startled by my dad sitting at the kitchen table, facing the stairs with a coffee mug in his hand. The aroma of ground coffee beans drifted around the dimly lit room.

‚ÄúH-hey dad? Couldn‚Äôt sleep, too?‚Äù I tried playing it cool, walking to the first chair at the table and sitting down.

	‚ÄúNo.‚Äù my dad curtly answered. After what seemed like hours being drawn out of the realistic few seconds of silence, he continued speaking. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶feeling okay, bud?‚Äù he asked in a wary manner that was only thinly veiled by a casual approach. It seemed like he was anticipating something, an answer that he would either want or dread. I decided to go with the answer he wanted. For all I knew, he would‚Äôve turned what seemed like normal coffee in his hand into Irish Coffee. 

	‚ÄúYeah, just kind of worried. I think I might‚Äôve seen someone watching us when we were getting the spyglass. For some reason it got me a little freaked out.‚Äù I came up with the lie on the spot, rubbing the fabric of my pajama bottoms to keep the sweat on my hands from accumulating. I hated lying to my dad. 

	‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù my dad rubbed the edges of his handlebar mustache, the dark droplets of coffee blending into his dark brown whiskers. ‚ÄúThey better think twice before barging in here! We‚Äôve got a harpoon gun on our side.‚Äù He stated in jesting confidence, probably wanting to put me at ease.

‚ÄúSure, Dad. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs going to come in handy. I think I‚Äôm just going to prop a chair under the door to give me peace of mind. I‚Äôm sure if Peter needs to use the bathroom in the middle of the night he can figure out how to move it.‚Äù I grabbed the chair I was sitting on and began walking up the stairs while carrying the back of it.

‚ÄúSounds good. I‚Äôll be here a while!‚Äù he waved me off and took another sip of his coffee. As I went into my room and got ready to prop the chair under the door handle, I remember asking myself why was he drinking coffee in the middle of the night. I walked back into my temporary bedroom and propped the chair underneath the door handle and twisted the lock on it. Climbing into bed once more, I closed my eyes in a silent prayer of a peaceful night that was left unanswered.

**Journal Log 12/19/2024**

*Reflecting on June 29th, 1972*

*Fever Dreams*

I was standing underneath the dim lights of the gymnasium at my middle school. My chestnut brown hair was slicked back, and I was wearing the same tan pants and chocolate colored jacket that I wore to the spring fling dance that was just a few months ago. The sounds of music and chatter amongst my classmates made me feel like I was there that night. Just about 10 feet away from me was Jessica Samuels, the girl I had the biggest crush on in my class. Her thick, long frizzy hair bounced up and down to the beat of ‚ÄúI Want You Back‚Äù by The Jackson 5. I swallowed the lump in my throat and walked towards her. She turned around, honey brown hair swishing along with the purple dress she was wearing. Her baby blue eyes locked onto me, and she gave a hearty grin before opening her mouth to say something. Whatever she was about to say was cut short with a slow song. 

‚ÄúW-want to dance?‚Äù I nervously asked, heat spreading to my cheeks as I prayed to God that I am not caked in sweat. She nodded, tucking her hair behind her ear while her lips curved up into a shy smile. I shakily placed my hands on her waist as she put her hands on my shoulders. We swayed to the beat as I tried looking at anything but her. I was already feeling my heart pounding in my ears, and looking at her might have sent me into cardiac arrest. I could hear her chuckle before pulling me close to where I can feel the air leaving her nostrils against my neck. The music faded as I could only hear the sound of my own chest beating into my head. 

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave me.‚Äù I felt Jessica‚Äôs grip on me tighten before I pulled away at the end of the song. She sounded almost desperate, clinging to me as though I would fade away otherwise.

	‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I was surprised by this. She barely talked to me in class, let alone showed any sign of noticing whether I left or not. 

‚ÄúEveryone keeps leaving.‚Äù She sunk her head against my collarbone as she continued. ‚ÄúMy family, my gods.‚Äù She hummed as she exhaled in a shaky sigh.

I tried pushing away from her, sensing that something wasn‚Äôt right. Her grip only became stronger, sliding her hands to my torso and sinking her nails into my skin. I pulled my head away just enough to get a glimpse of her. Everything about her looked like Jessica except one tell-tale sign. Her eyes were without pupils, instead being completely filled with the ill blue color I dreaded. I looked over at one of the doors to the gymnasium, seeing Grandpa Sean‚Äôs flabbergasted face in the door‚Äôs window. I could hear muffled shouts that I could not make out, as well as the metal banging of him trying to get in with no avail. I tried going towards him, but her stiff arms made a cage that I could not slip through.

‚ÄúThey gave me so many blessings. And I gave those on the shore blessings beyond their mortal comprehension. But those damn people with robes and crosses lured them away. My gods retreated, their temples burned and altered into something else. I‚Äôve prayed and prayed, but they won‚Äôt answer. They kept me warm and full of divine fortune, but I am a cold rotting shell now.‚Äù She squeezed me to the point I could feel my ribs crack with excruciating pain. I gasped and let out a scream, but no noise came out. She leaned close to where her breath grazed my earlobe, causing my blood to curdle inward. ‚ÄúCould I wear your skin?‚Äù She asked this so politely, as though she were asking for a jacket instead of the outer layer of my body. Her fingers started burrowing into my skin as though the surface was merely clay. I pulled my head away once more, seeing how her face was slowly turning into the sickly grey gelatinous mess that was merely a veil for her skull that was peeking out through the crevices. I struggled against her with all my might, trying to kick my legs against her shins. I kept kicking harder, hoping she would give. Her fingers were now immersed to the point I could only see the palms of her hands, the digits grazing over my muscles beneath my skin.

 I started to hear pounding coming from in front of me, as well as something pulling me from behind. I felt two large, familiar hands grabbing my shoulders, shaking me. I gasped as the scenery in front of me changed from a struggle for my own flesh in a hellish gymnasium into my father‚Äôs panicked shouts. Behind him was the bedroom door nearly falling off of its hinges. Looking down, I saw my own shins were bruised and bleeding, already pulsing in pain. I turned my head to the side, seeing the chair I used to block off the doorway was tossed to the side. Next to the chair was Peter, clutching his nose as blood oozed from his nostrils from what I could assume was the result of my unconscious battle. I looked back at my father, seeing his eyes widen as sweat started peeking out of his pores. All I could do was cry. My vision blurred with my tears, and I was no longer able to hear what anyone around me was saying. Just the humming melody that nestled into my brain like a radio with no dial or switch to turn off was what I could hear as the crying turned to heaving sobs. I remember getting on my knees as my legs were too shaky to support me, closing my eyes, and having my world fade to black.

When I opened my eyes next, I was not in the same bed as Peter. Turning my head to the right, I could see the framed photo of my grandfather with my grandmother, both smiling in a garden in what looked like unadulterated bliss. A feverish chill came over me, noticing how damp my pillow was. The simultaneous feeling of burning up while also freezing, followed by the force of gravity seemingly doubling down upon my weakened state, dampened my motivation to sit up. I craned my head to the other side of the bed, seeing my father sat in a chair with his head tucked into his hands, fingers interweaving with his hair. After a deep sigh, he looked up and he met my gaze with his eyes being outlined with dark circles shimmering with the layer of drying tears over them. 

‚ÄúHey, bud. How are you feeling?‚Äù he asked, his voice soft yet hoarse as though my answer could break him if it contained the slightest hint of dread.

‚ÄúI think I might have a fever. Maybe I can sleep it off.‚Äù I tried deflecting, fearful that telling him that I can hear the humming of celestial-like symphonies tucked behind my eardrum that are beckoning me to the murky waters that lay just downhill.

‚ÄúSon. I want you to be fully honest with me. It‚Äôs not just a fever, is it?‚Äù he scooted closer to my bedside, decreasing the distance between us. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dense, I have a feeling there‚Äôs more.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I-I‚Äôm just scared. I‚Äôm seeing and hearing things, I‚Äôm getting really bad nightmares. I might be going crazy.‚Äù I fidgeted with the covers, tears welling up. I was terrified, not knowing what was happening, what was to become of me. Would I, too, have to live as a recluse that would be gazed down upon by the neighborhood and be tortured in the prison of my mind? 

‚ÄúWhat kind of things?‚Äù my father gently took my hand and rubbed his thumb in soothing circles on the back of it. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he held my hand, but the soothing action seemed to regress my mental state to that of my six year old self that would cry after falling off of my bike. 

‚ÄúRemember that mermaid creature Grandpa was talking about? I read his journals about her‚Ä¶and I think I saw her. I-I think she‚Äôs in my head. I‚Äôm scared she wants‚Ä¶.that she wants to kill me. And it sounds crazy‚Ä¶I just‚Ä¶‚Äù I could feel the hot tears trace down my face as I started sniffling. I felt a soft squeeze from my father‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that‚Ä¶all by yourself.‚Äù My dad‚Äôs voice quivered as I saw his lip trembled. ‚ÄúI think I had an idea that was the case. You were doing some of the stuff he would do.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWell for starters, the rolling your eyes in the back of your head and gazing off was a dead giveaway‚Äù he dryly chuckled, ‚Äúand you wanting to blockade the door before your nightmare. I was sitting down here to make sure you didn‚Äôt sleep-walk outside.‚Äù He looked at my sheepish facial expression. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I just didn‚Äôt want you to shut down.‚Äù I squeezed his hand back as I looked away.

‚ÄúHey, look at me.‚Äù My father gently commanded, which I complied. ‚ÄúIt should not be your responsibility of how I react. I know I haven‚Äôt been the best with handling things, and I‚Äôm sorry. But I‚Äôm here now.‚Äù He gave me a small smile before getting up and sitting on the side of the bed. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs just been things that I never really got over. I think I was a lot like you at my age.‚Äù With a light sigh he continued, ‚ÄúI think your grandpa thought he hid his issues pretty well, but I could see through it‚Ä¶.I mean, what household has a bedroom door that locks on the outside for their dad to go to when he was sleepwalking? The weird nights that I would wake up to find him staring down at me silently, his figure being outlined by my nightlight causing me to almost scream. Sometimes during those nights I could hear him muttering that she‚Äôs not going to hurt me.‚Äù My dad started rubbing his temples with frustration. ‚ÄúI honestly just thought he was schizophrenic and kind of distanced from him. Then he left.‚Äù He sighed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that to happen to us, that we can‚Äôt trust each other to know what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù 

I reached out to hug him, feeling his warm body wrap around me in a gentle but tight grip. His dark hair tickled the side of my face as he gave me a small squeeze. He pulled away, placing his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúWhen Aunt Rowan gets here, I‚Äôm going to ask her to take us to her place and see about getting back home as soon as possible. I already got what I needed from this house. We can figure out any of this weird curse shit when we get back to the states.‚Äù He looked at the clock on Grandpa‚Äôs nightstand and tapped his feet nervously. ‚ÄúShe should have been here by now, it‚Äôs already five.‚Äù He wiped his nose with his thumb and forefinger while looking at the bedroom door. 

‚ÄúLike 5 PM? Seriously?‚Äù I was shocked about how long I was asleep for. 

‚ÄúYeah, you needed the rest.‚Äù He slowly blinked, noticeably struggling to open his eyelids. ‚ÄúNow listen, if I ever have to leave the room, I am going to bolt it from the outside in case you fall asleep, all right?‚Äù I nodded in agreement at his plan. ‚ÄúGood, now I‚Äôm going to see if I can at least whip you up some soup or something.‚Äù He got up to leave, turning back to say ‚ÄúCall out if you need anything.‚Äù, before closing the door. I heard the creaky metal of the sliding lock shift itself into place, temporarily confining me for my own safety. I didn‚Äôt feel like sleeping despite heavy exhaustion weighing over me, worried I would be pulled in another nightmare. My ears still rang with the honey-tongued hymn, but it seemed to calm down some. 

I eventually decided to sit up and see if there was anything of interest to read or look at as I was bed-ridden. Thankfully I found a book resting on the nightstand. Drawing it towards me, I read the cover One Thousand and One Nights. Tucked in the middle was a receipt being used as a bookmark. Flipping to the inside cover, there was a message in pen with the words ‚ÄúHappy 15th Birthday, Connor. I know you might be a little old for this book, but I found it in my old collection when I returned to Ireland. As it brought me much joy throughout my childhood, I hope it gives you some joy as well.‚Äù Skimming to where the bookmark was, the receipt being used was from the snack station at the airport we were at when waiting for our plane here. I decided to start from the beginning and try to make it as far as my dad had read it to. Maybe it would‚Äôve given us something to talk about. 

Around fifteen minutes later my focus tore away from the pages with a knock from downstairs. I couldn‚Äôt hear much, but I could tell that my father was talking to another man based on the low, grumbling voices that travelled through the wooden floorboards. The heightened volume of my dad‚Äôs voice did not need words to tell me that whatever he was being told was not good news. I waited for a few more minutes until I heard the creak of metal slide on the other side of the door. In stepped my father with a bowl of soup, steam still dancing above the broth. Setting it down on the nightstand, my dad sat on the chair next to the bed with a heavy sigh.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Dad?‚Äù I asked, feeling the sense of panic beating into me from the source of his own amygdala pounding in its cranial confines. 

‚ÄúIt was one of the policemen down the street. They got a call from Aunt Rowan telling them to be on the lookout. She‚Äôs driving around and I can‚Äôt get ahold of her.‚Äù He started scratching at his scalp as though he wanted to reach where his tissue ended and his skull started. I could tell from the quickened breaths and flushed look on his face that he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I was starting to feel my stomach turn inwards, the soup next to me starting to look like a vile concoction that would only make me hurl my insides out. He then said the words that, without the siren‚Äôs call whispering sweet nothings into my ear, would have caused all the noise around me to deafen.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your grandpa. He‚Äôs missing.‚Äù

I (20M) am trying to get over her (21F) but it feels like there is still hope, but I need to think there isn't to move on.","**Long post, sorry! Scroll down to find my main feelings, plus a TL;DR. Please help, I wake up feeling shit and go to bed feeling even worse. I want to breakdown but can't and have no motivation for anything.**

**Initial Story:**

A good female friend of mine broke up with her bf of 2.5-3 years. He was a complete c\*nt (I'll spare you the details), and she had been trying to break up with him for around 5-6 months, having already began to check out mentally, but he wouldn't accept this, or would guilt her out of it etc and so it took her that long to finally end it. I didn't know they were having issues, to be completely honest, we rarely talked about her bf.

Before any of you start, I knew the entire time she had a bf and didn't attempt anything. I always thought she was attractive and that he was lucky but knew better than to even contemplate trying anything, and to be honest I didn't want to. They seemed happy and I didn't have any desire to be with her, I just thought she was an incredible person to spend time with, we also had roles in uni societies that meant that we had to keep regular contact, this was when we would meet. We never went out of our way to see each other, but when we did we were good friends.

She told me they broke up and it came as a big shock to me as I thought it was going well. We naturally started talking more and more, and it began to become more flirty and near future looking (summer plans). We saw each other in person for the first time after three weeks and kissed, the same happened two other times that week. The final time I went back to hers and we cuddled and talked. This was too quick for her and she said she thinks 'if the timing was different it could be something great but we need to stop before we get ahead of ourselves', as she knew she couldn't jump straight into something at that time. Our contact ceased completely. I hated it as we went from talking a lot for months to not at all.

We saw each other a few days later, drunk, walked home and both confessed feelings for each other. She said a person like me would be perfect in a few months, but that I couldn't wait as she didn't know how she would feel then. We agreed to keep contact this time, but it had to be limited as we wouldn't stop talking otherwise, so the conversation quickly died as it couldn't be had freely.

A week later we were both out in the student club, she came up to me. We spoke, but she said we had to stay away from each other as we couldn't do 'anything silly'. She then came and found me at the end and I walked her home. Long story short I woke up in her bed and we slept together in the morning, I had been with other women before but had never gone the full way as I had wanted to wait for someone I actually cared about. This girl was just that, shes the only person I've ever had feelings for, I can't even remember ever having a crush on anyone else. Things went well, it seemed like we were going to move forward together, until a guy I know loudly declared that her and I had slept together whilst she was working. She called me, she spiralled about it, she ended it. Contact ceased again.

We saw each other the next week in our student club, I tried to speak with her but she wouldn't really talk to me. Her friends then told me she had left 20 seconds earlier alone, I called her and offered to walk her home, she accepted. On the walk home I confessed my feelings for her again, and my desire to try something out. She claimed it would not be beneficial for any future chance we had if we tried now as she wasn't able to get into anything serious that soon, and we couldn't be casual as she was already attached to me and couldn't get anymore attached. I then said goodnight at her door, and went home.

The week later, we bumped into each other outside the libray, we talk and she offers for me to come study with her, my bestfriend and her bestfriend (who are know dating, they started due to this girl and I getting together). They go home at 9pm ish, me and the girl stay late together (2am). We have to said timers to stop talking to each other as we just always would click and be able to talk for hours without getting bored. I then walk her home. We bump into each other again at the library the day later (exam season - not great timing I know). Sit together again and stay late again. That night she messages me asking when I am leaving for summer (on the pretence of asking me to do some stuff). This continues for a couple days,  until one day she needs to leave early to go to a popular sunset viewing spot, I thought it was just with a friend.

When I ask her how the sunset was, she says 'it was nice, to be completely honest it was kind of a date'. I am shocked. Turns out she is bisexual (I did know this before I just forgot it in the moment). I ask to speak about it, and everything that had happened between us, as we hadn't spoken about it before. She reluctantly agrees. I just start talking, about how I feel, what I want etc. I then ask her how she feels, she said she felt more confused than she thought. So we agree to meet up, and we talk for 3 hours. About our feelings for each other, what we want long term, this girl she went on a date with (and kissed the week earlier in the club), her ex. We agreed for then to remain friendly, and even to do somethings after exams platonically. I mentioned how I would probably message her in September asking to go for a drink and she said that was fine. I walked her home arm in arm.

The next day she tells me she's less confused, and wants to try it again with me, and doing somethings together after exams (maybe more than just platonically). And that talking about it made her realise how strong her feelings were for me. She said it was scary though as she didn't expect to feel this way about someone so quickly after her breakup. We then spent the next week together in the library. We stayed late, she would always find an excuse to come over and sit with me. We had lots of breaks and had a lot of laughs. We ended up walking home holding hands and kissing each night, a big deal as it was her first sober kiss since her ex. She even said that she wanted to invite me in but had told herself she couldn't until after exams. She sent me a message later saying how much she wanted to invite me in, but she knew if she did she'd end up sleeping with me. And because it would be the first 'sober' time for us it was a big deal as she felt strongly about me and then didn't want to mess it up etc. I told her she didn't have to rationalise it to me at all, and that I was happy wait for anything if she was uncomfortable. This continued for a week. We were basically a couple, I would deliberately go to the library if she was struggling and take her coffee or gluten free snacks (as she is gf), she almost cried as her ex wouldn't have done that etc. She kept saying how used to boys she was, and dealing with a man was scary at times as she wasn't used to someone who spoke their mind and was emotionally mature.

After her exams ended, mine continued she began to get distant. I was beginning to get anxious (I overthink everything) but had to focus on my exams. The night before my final exam, she was out with coworkers near to the library, I messaged telling her I was stressed and that if she was passing by (she would have been) I would love to say hello. She had done the same to me a lot the previous week.

I get no response. I don't get a response until after my exam the next day, and it was a '(name) this is too many messages'. I had sent to her a reply to her questions, then the message asking to see her, and then a goodnight get home safe message. I asked if everything was alright, she said it wasn't and that it was all too much for her at the moment. I asked to call, after initially telling me I would have to wait two days, she begrudgingly agreed to speak to me.

The whole call she didn't seem interested. She said it was too much for her at the moment and she didn't want to have to worry about being obligated to reply to someone. I asked if we could still do the things we planned too, or to message. She said we couldn't as her feelings were too strong for me and that she has to set a boundary otherwise she would want a relationship with me despite knowing she wasn't ready. I say ok, and wish her the best of luck. I reiterate how I feel about her, to which she reciprocates, and then say goodbye.

**After it Properly Ended:**

The next night we're both out, we don't acknowledge each other really despite me wanting to go say hi with all my might. I then see her leave with a coworker. We're out again a few nights later, I tried to speak to her, she made it very brief. I see her hanging out with said coworker. They then go do a traditional football match in the park after the last student night of the year (she worked at the student club). They would've been playing football until 7am.

She then follows him on all socials, private instagram, spotify, tiktok, linkedin, strava etc. I get it officially confirmed they slept together both times, they talked for a fews days but then she cut it off as she wanted it to be completely casual. (This came from a mutual friend, so may not be true but I believe them).

**My Feelings (Very confused)**

I feel like shit. I know we didn't owe anything to eachother physically, but I thought we did emotionally. I think I am feeling jealousy about the other guy, but also I am feeling like I wasn't good enough. She made a big deal about inviting me in after exams and how it was a big step but then could sleep with this other guy so easily. They weren't close before. It's also killing me as I need to stop having hope about waiting for her. There may be hope, but I cannot wait for it to happen as it may not. I'm trying not to imagine her and him doing things that I thought were incredibly intimate for us, but its hard. She said to her friend that 'we only spent one night together' which also hurts as I feel I may have gotten more attached to a one sided situation, although it may just be her rationalising it. I am madly in love with her, I miss the way I was with her. How we looked at each other, how even the most trivial things happening would be fun to tell her. I realised how lonely I am. I live rurally at home and so over the summer theres little chance of finding someone new, not that I want to.

I havent properly spoken to her in a few weeks, she did send me a post last week so we exhchanged a very brief conversation about it. I'm hoping she will message closer to September, as apparantely she only hasn't in order to 'give me chance to get over her'. I am not returning to uni in September. I am moving an hour and a half away to work as part of my course. She mentioned this as a potential issue as well, but I would be more than willing to come visit her at weekends (every other maybe) and that not spending every second of everyday with her would make it more meaningful.

I need help moving on from her, its ruining my life. I am obsessed with her, and the thought of her with someone else disgusts me (I know it shouldn't as she isn't mine, but it still does). She's the only person I've ever had any feelings for an I am terrified it won't happen again anytime soon. How do I move on knowing there may be a chance and that no matter what happens I will have to see her next year (society events).

I think I am also very confused about it all. I am very much a 'everything has a why if you look hard enough' type of person, so I am torturing myself trying to find an answer. I also know she is probably less emotionally mature and available as she would like to admit due to her past relationship. She is also very confused about what she wants and probably needs to time to figure it out. But all I want to do is message her, but I am not emotionally stable enough yet to do that.

I have also lost a very good friend, I don't just miss the romantic side of it I also miss how good we were as friends. 

I also suspect maybe I am ruing the potential and the fact I was so close to being properly loved for the first time.

ChatGPT generated TL;DR:

My close female friend broke up with her terrible boyfriend after a long, messy breakup. I didn‚Äôt even know they were struggling, but I‚Äôd always liked her as a person. After the breakup, we naturally grew closer ‚Äî we started texting a lot, flirting, kissing, and eventually sleeping together. She kept pulling away because she wasn‚Äôt ready for a new relationship so soon, but we both kept gravitating back to each other because the connection felt so strong.

Despite telling me she couldn‚Äôt handle anything serious with me, she hooked up with another guy casually right after saying she wanted to wait to be intimate with me because it ‚Äúmeant more.‚Äù That made me feel rejected, jealous, and confused because I thought what we had was special and worth waiting for. Now she‚Äôs cut things off (again) to set boundaries, but I‚Äôm stuck hoping she‚Äôll come back even though, deep down, I know I can‚Äôt rely on that.

I‚Äôm heartbroken, obsessing over her, and struggling with loneliness. I‚Äôm about to move away for work, but I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt find this kind of connection again, and knowing I‚Äôll see her at uni events next year makes it even harder to let go.",1,1752622907.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

*Reflecting on June 27th, 1972*

*Something Wrong in the Lakeside Neighborhood*

The ride to the lake house was dead silent. The only sound we heard was Aunt Rowan sniffling, probably mourning that her brother‚Äôs mind was as good as dead. My dad‚Äôs face was pale and his body posture rigid. My brother sat wide-eyed like he was traumatized by the encounter. ‚ÄòLucky him‚Äô I thought, ‚Äòhe didn‚Äôt have his grandpa‚Äôs fingers pop like a tic all over his arm.‚Äô I rubbed the bruised and cracked skin on my forearm. Finally, we arrived at dusk. 

The house was two stories and made mostly from stone, with a grey-tiled roof. It looked so cold and drafty. Thankfully the electricity still worked, my dad pulling the cord attached to the lightbulb overhead. 

‚ÄúThe house is old-fashioned, so ya got to use the fireplace for warmth. Thankfully it‚Äôs not too bad of weather.‚Äù Aunt Rowan explained. ‚ÄúI cleaned a lot of it up since it was a pig sty when they finally got him out of the house! I got some food for you in the cupboards that don‚Äôt need refridgeratin‚Äô. The fridge doesn‚Äôt like to work and had a bunch of spoiled dead fish in it anyway, so I wouldn‚Äôt open it if I were you. The smell lingers no matter how much ye scrub it!‚Äù Aunt Rowan crinkled her face at the thought of the putrid smell of rotting fish. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go home before it gets too dark. I‚Äôll be coming over as much as I can. In the meantime, if you need anything there‚Äôs a little pub and restaurant down the street. Next to it is a police station. It‚Äôs a very quiet area, so they‚Äôre never busy. Just making sure the drunks aren‚Äôt getting into fights.‚Äù She pointed to the direction of where some of the only signs of human life were. Rowan gave us a hug goodbye and headed back on her way. 

We wandered around the house, feeling our feet creak on the floorboards. Peter and I rushed to our temporary room, hoping for the stone walls to give the ambiance of a medieval castle. Instead, we were met with lackluster plastered walls with a floral wallpaper that would be any grandmother‚Äôs wildest dream. Worst of all, there was only one bed. 

‚ÄúIf you roll on my side of the bed you better expect your butt to be hitting the hard floor, numbnuts.‚Äù I gave an empty threat to my brother, not looking forward to his limbs flailing in his sleep onto my own tired body. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair! I can‚Äôt help it!‚Äù my brother protested, pleading that my future self wouldn‚Äôt throw his scrawny eight year old body onto the hard wooded surface. 

We unpacked some of our clothes and headed downstairs to get a better look at the rest of the area. There was a small yet bulky television in the corner of the living room, a green couch with unidentifiable stains facing it. Beside the couch was the fireplace, which we were definitely going to need as the insulation in the house was minimal at best. When we walked in the kitchen, we saw what looked to be the back door of the house. Opening the door, we were able to see the view of the lake. It actually looked picturesque, the light of the moon being reflected on the water‚Äôs surface. I would‚Äôve dared Peter to a rolling race down the hill from the door to the shore right next to the lake if our stomachs didn‚Äôt start growling that second. We pulled back and turned towards the kitchen itself. It had an old, rustic feel that also gave off a chilly presence. The countertops, stove, everything just felt so‚Ä¶empty. I guess I‚Äôd take empty versus the disgusting mess Aunt Rowan seemed to have to push through. Checking the kitchen cabinets we gave a lukewarm response. Beans and peas in cans and a sack of potatoes was pretty much it. On the top shelf was some Irish whiskey and cans of pop. My dad‚Äôs face contorted into a grimace for a second before making the announcement to check out the pub for a well-deserved meal. Peter and I nodded enthusiastically, pulling our eyes away from whatever fate would await our stomachs another day. 

Opening the doors to the small pub was like a disgusting yet mystical entrance, with the smoke from pipes and cigarettes pooling out into the open night air. It would‚Äôve been more enchanting if the smell and smoke didn‚Äôt sting our eyes and make us go into coughing fits. Stepping inside, it did not feel like a place where children should be. But probably due to the lack of other options and lax rules of a remote establishment they had some young teens that looked not much older than us. It looked like they were playing some sort of tabletop soccer with a wad of paper as the ball, batting and flicking it with their fingers. After ordering some food, we noticed we became a spectacle in the establishment. In a small community that does not have any big attractions, having three people come here halfway across the world was probably a novelty. An elderly bartender waved for my dad to come over, probably inquiring what brings us to these parts. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you talk to those other kids over there? Make some friends!‚Äù my dad encouraged, knowing that they likely would be prying about him and his dad. I gave Peter a worried glance, giving him the nonverbal question of whether we want to talk to total strangers. Peter shared the same glance as well, but we knew we didn‚Äôt have much choice. My dad always encouraged us to talk to other kids, and the more he intervened the more embarrassing it was for us. Might as well take the easy way.

‚ÄúH-hey. My name‚Äôs Jim. And this is my brother, Peter. We‚Äôre just visiting for a while.‚Äù I awkwardly introduced myself, all my memories of how to make a solid introduction leaving my mind when I saw the blank stares of the teens in front of me. 

After an uncomfortably long pause, one of the teens spoke. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Lou, we don‚Äôt get many outsiders around here.‚Äù Lou gestured to his friend across the table, ‚Äúand this guy‚Äôs Ryan. He don‚Äôt talk much, but he‚Äôs a grand boyo!‚Äù Lou teasingly laughed as Ryan rolled his eyes. 

‚ÄúNow what brings ya to these parts?‚Äù Lou asked with a inquisitive smile.

‚ÄúOur Grandpa might be dying soon. Sean O‚ÄôBrien?‚Äù I explained bluntly. I was curious if they knew what he was like, or if there was anything that could put into context the enraged jargon he spewed at the nursing home.

‚ÄúHoly shite, man. Old man Sean? Screw-loose Sean!‚Äù Lou‚Äôs eyes widened in excitement, Ryan‚Äôs head perking up at the name. ‚ÄúYer old man‚Äôs crazy! I mean-‚Äú Lou awkwardly coughed, realizing that ‚Äòreading the room‚Äô was a phrase he was still struggling with. 

‚ÄúI never knew him. All I know is that he was a shit father and that he has dementia now.‚Äù I shrugged, not taking much offense over a man who was not even in my personal realm of existence until the past week. I was also probably trying to sound nonchalant for the big kids, my little brother widening his eyes when I said a cuss word while my dad was in the same room. 

‚ÄúBoyo, he has been like that for as long as even my parents can remember. Always obsessin over weird mermaids and shite.‚Äù Lou explained, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling. ‚ÄúAlways screamin‚Äô nonsense. We were too scared to even touch the lake one year unless ya wanted to risk gettin‚Äô a harpoon lodged in ya.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy dad says ‚Äòes probably just traumatized from the boatin‚Äô accident.‚Äù Ryan stated quietly, seemingly showing more tact than his clueless partner. We were interrupted by my dad walking up to hand us our order of fish and chips and walking back to the bar.

‚ÄúI-is that how his leg got messed up?‚Äù I asked quietly as Dad walked away, wanting to know the answer to how his leg looked so warped and mangled, like some animal bit and clawed into fleshy play-dough and left it out in the sun to dry. 

‚ÄúYeah. My parents remember when it happened. ‚Äòe had to be in the hospital for a while. I was too young to really remembe‚Äô it. ‚Äòis brother‚Äôs body was found a little ways by the shore. A lot of us think that they went on a fishin‚Äô trip, boat capsized, and brother drowned while the other one got ‚Äòis leg caught in somethin‚Äô. He probably got some paranoia or some shite. Swearin‚Äô some water beast they were tryin‚Äô to catch nailed ‚Äòem.‚Äù Ryan recalled, piecing together from what he heard from others about the event. 

‚ÄúWait, so his brother died from it? Drowning, I mean. Not some water beasts or some stupid crap.‚Äù I quickly corrected myself, trying not to sound like a small kid asking if the boogeyman was really under my bed. However, my mind was still full of questions about this ‚Äúbeast‚Äù. Does he still want to kill it out of revenge? Safety? The grandeur delusion of being blessed with fortune? I honestly think it was all of the above. I pondered this as Peter and I were munching on our food, trying to listen intently to the lore of our grandfather.

‚ÄúYup. Dead as a doornail. They both were a lil nuts about huntin‚Äô some weird creature.‚Äù Lou paused to pick at some of our fries without asking, absentmindedly shoving them in his mouth.‚ÄúBut Sean got way worse. I bet you‚Äôll find some weird shite in that house. You have to show us the weirdest thing you find before you leave!‚Äù Lou said with enthusiasm, hands pressed on the table as he stood up halfway like an excited child ready to jump for joy. Ryan nodded more subtly, trying to be polite while also intrigued at what might be in the house. Before we could say anything else, my dad called for us to come over and leave for the house. As I turned back to look at the boys in the back before walking out the door, I remember seeing Lou fanning his hands around his neck and pursing his lips like a gilled fish and Ryan promptly smacking him on the shoulder. 

‚ÄúHow was it talking to the boys? You looked like you were chatting it up.‚Äù My dad asked us, his voice slightly weary from talking. 

‚ÄúGrandpa sounded like a weirdo.‚Äù Peter replied without a second thought. I could tell my dad stiffened at that comment until carrying on.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶.it sounds like he had some issues.‚Äù My dad said this, trailing off. I‚Äôm guessing he heard a portion about his father from the locals as well. I hope the tipsy adults had more gentle tact than an Irish teen with untreated ADHD. Whatever they said, he looked tired and beaten down. 

When we got back to the house, Peter and I went upstairs to get ready for bed, shuffling into the stiff sheets under the heavy quilt. Although Peter was out like a light, I still had trouble sleeping. My brain was on rapid fire, trying to make sense of what all I learned about Grandpa. He came from Ireland with my grandma and my dad, left them to go back to Ireland for some unknown business, he and his brother get into a boating accident some years after that, then he became the deranged man that sunk his claws into my arm today. It just all felt‚Ä¶.weird. I was interrupted from my thoughts by the sound of the creaking floor downstairs. I quietly slipped out of bed, trying not to wake my brother. I wanted to see if Dad was up so I could ask him more about Grandpa. As I was about to make my way out the doorway, I heard the creaking of the stairs. I waited quietly to pop out of the darkness to greet him, but I halted when I heard the light clanking of glass. Hiding by the doorframe, I peered to see my dad walking by to his bedroom, Irish whiskey and glass in hand. His sobriety streak had ended, and so did my naive confidence in asking him to join me on this quest of solving the mysterious days that his own father spent on the prowl for some supernatural reward.

*Reflecting on June 28th, 1972 (Part 1)*

*Her Eyes*

The next morning I walked down the creaky wooded stairs and headed to the kitchen. Sitting at the table was Peter shoveling some scrambled eggs in his mouth, as well as my dad nursing a cup of coffee. I pretended not to notice my dad‚Äôs bloodshot eyes that he was desperately trying to hide. 

‚ÄúYou want me to whip you up some eggs Aunt Rowan brought over last night? Thankfully they‚Äôre farm fresh so no need for the fridge.‚Äù My dad inquired, shifting his legs to get up.

‚ÄúI know how to make eggs, I can do it.‚Äù I walked over to the stove to make some eggs for myself. Part of me was annoyed at him for the drinking, but the other part of me wanted to give him some ease of mind due to the emotional weight of the day before. As I sat down with my sunny-side up delicacy, the gentle knock of Aunt Rowan rapped at the door. After my father let her in, she took a seat at the dining room table and began discussing plans for sorting through Grandpa‚Äôs items. I was gazing at the bright yellow yolk oozing from its transparent layer, finding it more captivating than anything they were discussing. 

‚ÄúDoes that sound good, Jim?‚Äù my dad‚Äôs questioning snapped me from the yolk‚Äôs hypnosis.

‚ÄúYeah, sure.‚Äù I agreed, not knowing what the hell he was even talking about. I was just tired after all of the travelling, hoping that whatever we were doing did not involve getting into another vehicle. I finished my eggs and followed the others upstairs, acting as though I was in on their plans. We walked towards the end of the hallway and headed towards Grandpa Sean‚Äôs room.

I do not know how to describe the room of my dearly demented grandfather, but comfortable and relaxed were the antonyms to whatever I was thinking when the door with the outside lock creaked open, revealing where he had been sleeping all these years. Granted, most of the items that may have decorated the walls or sat on top of the dressers were in boxes around the floor. However, the room itself would have looked like a medieval prison no matter how many portraits were hung. The interior was also the grey, lifeless stone that made up the outside of the house. What was supposed to be the biggest source of natural light for the room, the main window, was boarded and sealed shut. The only other source of natural light was a short but long window above the bed, just tall enough for a child to maybe squeeze through, but seemingly its only purpose would be letting some light or air in. I went up to inspect the boarded window, wondering why he would do this despite the window being in-tact on the outside. The wooded panels that were hammered along the frame of the window were around a ¬Ω inch thick. Along the sides of the panels told a story of their own based on the grooves and scratch marks that seemed to be partially filled with crusted, dried blood. I backed away, disturbed by this discovery. My dad and Aunt Rowan seemed to be actively avoiding my questioning look when I turned around, as though they were begging me to not point out the evidence of their relative‚Äôs insanity. As I walked back closer towards the door, I saw scratch marks along the edge and bottom of the side facing his room, as well as the floor that lay just in front of it. The side of the door that faced the hallway was pristine, but the other side looked as though a starving dog was clawing for an escape. The shape of the scratches were far too wide to be a dog‚Äôs, and the thought of Grandpa Sean‚Äôs nearly non-existent nailbeds and skinned fingertips made me shudder. There were several boxes, so we divvied them up amongst ourselves to sort through. His bedroom was getting crowded with my great aunt‚Äôs explanation of different photos or objects, which fascinated Peter to no end. I decided to take a couple of boxes to the other bedroom to go through so that I could have more space. Opening the lid of the larger box, the first thing I saw was a note. It read: 

‚ÄúFor Connor, may you look at all this work and realize how much I‚Äôm putting my life at stake in order to make our lives the best they can possibly ever be. It will all be worth it in the end, it has to be. I love you, my boy.‚Äù 

I would have given this to my dad if he was not in such an emotionally volatile state. I couldn‚Äôt trust that he wouldn‚Äôt go on another bender. But a small, selfish side of me wanted to keep reading the contents of the box. What was he researching? I wanted to connect whatever nonsense he was saying yesterday to what was in the cardboard container sitting right in front of me. 

I picked up the first book titled Irish Legends , a bookmark placed in the middle of it. I opened to where it was marked. At the top of the page was the title ‚ÄúL√≠ Ban‚Äù. It looked like a short story. From what I recall it was the story of a woman, L√≠ Ban, whose entire land was flooded, killing everyone around her except her and her dog. She prayed to the gods that she would be turned into a fish in order to join the other fish around her, feeling lonely being the only human around. The gods decided to make her a half-fish instead, and she lived her life in her mermaid form. The ending was a little sappy for my taste, but at least I was starting to see some ties. 

I then pulled out a packet containing a written language that I could not understand. Next to it were different English words that seemed to be translating various parts of the document. Underneath was a translated copy that told a very different tale of L√≠ Ban. It started pretty much how the original started, her land flooding and leaving her all alone in the body of water. It started to branch away after she was turned into the mermaid. L√≠ Ban was gifted with fertility and sacred eggs, allowing her to have an abundance of children so she would never be alone again. However, as centuries passed, so did the beliefs of the Celtic deities. As the memories of the deities washed away, so did their blessings. Each of her living children died, and she began to change. What was once flesh-colored skin turned a sickly grey green. Her ability to live as both fish and human was deteriorating. She could no longer breathe air as she once did, and her scales and fins were deteriorating slowly and painfully. In her desperate state, she started eating some of the fish around her for food and energy. This was how she found out that consuming the fish allowed her to maintain the aquatic aspects of herself. Unfortunately, the human aspect of herself could not change. Her human skin started to die. She then began her hunt for man. Her blessings returned, and it says those who are lucky enough to find some of her eggs and consume them that they too will be blessed with fortune and vitality. This iteration tainted my image of the gorgeous woman with wavy locks sitting on a rock by the sea, imagining a rotting fish lady scratching onto a rock trying to eat me replacing it.

Underneath this translated piece was a worn-out green journal with a strip of masking tape over top, the words ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äôs Log‚Äù scrawled in ink onto the light-yellow adhesive. I opened the book to the first page. The paper lightly crackled under my touch, its hue a dusted yellow that was aged over the decades. Even the scent revealed its age, immediately hitting my nostrils with the slight musty smell that the aged books at my school library and at home would carry. In a weird way that faint aroma was almost a conditioned response that gave me a sense of comfort as though I was back at home, back laid against the side of the bed while I sat on the floor reading my dad‚Äôs small childhood collection of The Hardy Boys. My brain was itching with excitement and curiosity, thinking of all the possible epic tales that could be in store:



*""27/9/1930*

*I do not normally write, but I am going to need to. If what my brother Liam says is true and we find proof, our documents will go down in history and be a marvel of mythos and science. If not, then this will be a passion project that we can have a pint and laugh over.* 

*A few days ago, Liam came to visit the family and take me out for my first drink as a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù. For a fella from the countryside, he was lucky and smart enough to make his way into city life and follow his dream of being an anthropologist at the National Museum of Ireland. Unfortunately, I was not gifted nor had the drive to fight my way into the academic field. If it wasn‚Äôt for Liam instilling interest of legends and tales into me from a young age, I do not know how literate I would even be. We sat at the bar, clacking our pints together as we toasted to my walk into adulthood. While we were catching up, he paused and stated he needed to tell me something important. He showed me pictures of old, worn-down text that had letters and spelling that I could not quite make out. He explained that he and other anthropologists have been working thoroughly in translating this piece. It turned out to be a version of the story of L√≠ Ban that diverted a lot from the story of the mermaid saint of Ireland quite a bit. Although the story was said to first be preserved in a 12th century text, the dead language it was written in made it likely it was written in the 10th century or earlier. His team started connecting artwork and relics to this newfound story, as well as stories of rulers through the centuries who consumed the rare, mysterious orange pearls that were said to be of a mysterious fish in the Irish lakes, leading to victory and expansion of their kingdoms. There were also stories of a humanoid-like creature in nearby locations luring and pulling victims to their unexpected demise, which created a conclusive narrative that she has been the cause of both death and of fortune throughout history. Liam was fascinated by this historical mystery. For someone that has been spending most of his life catching and selling fish with his dad, this fascinated me.* 

*This is when Liam invited me to move in his flat with him. He knew how tired I was of being in a remote spot with just my parents and little sister, and he wanted someone to bring the practical knowledge to his idealistic pursuits of finding her. I entertained the notion and said yes, using it as an excuse to move into the adult world as an independent man. I started work as a fisherman near the Dublin area while he continued working with his other comrades in the museum. I met them a couple of times. Decent fellows, having their own theories of the lake monster. Some of them had family and friends that were police officers and detectives. Gathering information, the team pinpointed that she may be in a local lake due to recent reports of human remains being washed up with bite and scratch marks that did not look quite human. However, there was no known water creature that could have dismembered in such a calculated way, much less maul a person that badly. So, as a morbidly fun expedition, Liam and I would take one of the decent sized fishing boats out on the lake to find this ferocious mermaid. I will keep you updated."" (end of log)*

If there weren‚Äôt photos in the box showing the artifacts and the people involved, I would have thought these were simply ramblings of a single madman or a draft of a horror novel. What was odd was that multiple people were involved. One of the photos had a line of men standing in front of what looked like a museum gallery, which flipping over the black and white image were the names of the men written out in order of left to right. Following the order of names, I was able to point out Liam. He was tall and lanky man with a manicured mustache, his dark hair combed to the side as he gazed stoically into the eye of the camera. Another photo looked like Liam once more, only this time holding what looked like a small wooden sculpture of a mermaid. The back of the photo was labelled ‚ÄúLiam O‚ÄôBrien and relic found near the Larne River‚Äù. Educated scholars grouping together and going in-depth on this mythology seemed to be more deliberate than just a lighthearted story. They must have discovered something serious to keep digging. There were even various newspaper clippings of people disappearing under mysterious circumstances and bodies found with unnatural marks. Underneath laid a photo of two men standing in front of a harbor occupied by several watercraft of various sizes. One of the men was clearly Liam, who was wearing a lighter trench coat and smiling. The other one was as tall as him and donning a heavy, dark raincoat with dark pants and thick boots that reached his upper calves. A grin plastered his younger complexion that had the slightest hints of facial hair. Looking at the back of the photo, I read the caption ‚ÄúLiam and Sean O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs first quest‚Äù. My piqued curiosity quickly snowballed into a fascination that compelled me to keep reading, invested in the tales of an ancestor that I barely knew. 

The rest of the entries just logged false alarms, some fun stories, but nothing very eventful. However, one caught my eye:

*""16/5/1931*

*I am starting to have doubts about this daring hunt for L√≠ Ban after this expedition. Our night started uneventful like normal, craning our heads every time we heard a splash and seeing nothing more than a common fish. Another splash and fin slapped the surface of the water, but this one sounded different. Much‚Ä¶larger. About 8 meters away I saw something shimmering. I squinted my eyes into the dark, the light on the boat not quite reaching where I was looking. There, I saw her. If it wasn‚Äôt L√≠ Ban, I don‚Äôt know what else it was. The first thing I noticed was what was shimmering: her eyes. Those pale blue pools were transfixed on me. There were no pupils or iris, just the glowing hue of blue illuminating amidst the dark. As they brightened, I could make out her face. It looked like the most beautiful woman I could only ever imagine. I can‚Äôt really describe it or even remember much of what I saw. Wavy blonde locks cascaded into the water around her head, her lips plump and pink. All thoughts of logic or questioning shut down in my mind the instant the infatuation spell hit. She smiled at me, curling her finger towards her, beckoning me to jump in the water with her. The scary thing was that I just instantly wanted to heed to her command. I found myself putting my knee on the ledge of the boat, ready to start diving in.*

 *I was interrupted when Liam gripped my shoulder, pulling me back. This must have startled the creature, her eyes no longer glowing. I didn‚Äôt even notice how close she got to the boat. I could see her better now. Most of her skin was bloated and grayish like a corpse decomposing in the water. The flesh on her right cheek was dangling off as though it was ready to break away from her face at the slightest movement, revealing the tight muscle underneath. There were only a few strands of hair remaining on her peeling scalp, and it looked like her ears had already rotted off, having large, open scabs with holes underneath. This brief image before she dove back in the water has been burned into my mind, and I think it will be for a long time. I turned to Liam and grabbed his shoulders in desperation. I told him what I saw, and he immediately shone his torch over the area where she once was. All that we saw was a piece of gray, bloated flesh floating on the water‚Äôs surface. He grabbed a small net and scooped up the material, examining it with both intrigue and disgust. I begged him to just take us to shore. I just wanted to go home.* 

*In the morning Liam and I took it to a friendly coroner that he had gotten chummy with to examine the flesh, telling a white lie that we just found it while fishing and thought it might be human. The coroner determined it looked like the decayed tissue of a water-bloated body that likely drowned. However, something caught his eye. An odd, tar-like substance oozed out from the tissue with a consistency that he claimed he never saw drain through a water-bloated corpse. What was more odd was that it suddenly started evaporating, releasing a pungent odor that had bile crawling up my throat. As it sizzled into nothingness, we all took a step back and covered our faces, fearful that the fumes were toxic. A couple minutes later we all started to feel disoriented. I started to dissociate out of my body, but I didn‚Äôt mind. It felt strangely peaceful, pleasant even. We all had to sit down, small giggles erupting from our flushed faces. Whatever her skin drained out was turning us into giddy, wasted men that felt enamored with all around them. After about 30 minutes the effect wore off, leaving us confused as to what happened. The coroner tried finding more of it in her skin, seeing if he could contain it for examination, but upon exposure to the air it all drifted into invisible particles in the atmosphere. It would have looked suspicious if we begged him to not contact the police for investigation of the area, so we agreed for him to do so. As Liam and I walked to our flat, we wondered if the tar created the hypnotic effects that almost had me leap into the tepid waters with indescribably mirth. That afternoon police found the bottom torso of a man in the water. They blocked off that area of the lake and began a search for any more parts, concluding that this might have been a murderer disposing of evidence.* 

*The past two nights since that incident I keep having dreams about her. I don‚Äôt want to go into detail out of embarrassment, but they‚Äôre arousing in nature. Her song is not of any language I know, a language lost in time. I can‚Äôt make out the words, but the hum and melody are so angelic it brings me to tears when focusing on the sound. I want nothing more than to embrace her in those moments. Even in the day I can still hear the song, although quieter than the night. Plugging my ears doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs all in my head but I can hear it clearly. Last night my brother woke me up. We were in the middle of the street, both in our sleepwear. From what I gathered, I sleepwalked out of the flat. I have never sleepwalked before. Although I don‚Äôt remember what was happening in the specific dream leading up to this, I was sure I knew what I was unconsciously doing: I was going to see her. I‚Äôm planning on moving out, somewhere that doesn‚Äôt have water sources that can connect to the lake. Wherever I go, I‚Äôm not going to live alone and will install locks both outside and inside my bedroom. This will be my last entry."" (end of log)*

I felt a chill reading this passage. Maybe my grandfather wasn‚Äôt mad in the beginning. Something must have started to make him go mad. Seeing the carbon copy of the coroner report in different handwriting between the pages helped solidify his claim, detailing the incident. Although he claimed this was his last entry, there was some writing a couple pages past this one:

*""14/10/1947*

*I swore I‚Äôd never return, but here I am. It‚Äôs been a long time. I‚Äôm amazed this book has remained in tact for so long. Since last time I wrote, a lot has happened. I was saving up money to leave the country, opting to move to an area with no perceived risk of me finding a way to jump in a body of water where that monster could have realistically travelled to. I found who would be my beautiful wife, Maeve. Focusing on her kept my mind off of the ongoing hypnosis of song that still plagued my mind, and I wanted to try to live as normal of a life I could after the events that happened prior. L√≠ Ban stubbornly remained in my dreams though, tempting me. I kept going to confessions at any Catholic Church I could find about these dreams. Although I know it‚Äôs unconscious and she‚Äôs plaguing my mind, her sharp nails and the end of her webbed gray fingers sinking into my scalp without me ever permitting her to do so, it still felt adulterous looking over at my wife‚Äôs sleeping frame when I woke up from a bout of sleepwalking towards the aquatic predator.* 



*Our precious son Connor was born a couple years after our marriage. I swore when I cradled that babe in my arms for the first time that I was going to be the best father I could. We were doing well until the political unrest going on in the continent became more apparent. Whatever it was, it sounded like bad news. An upcoming war was the perfect excuse to pack and move out of Europe. Finally having saved up enough money, we decided to go to the United States. I would finally be reassured that she wouldn‚Äôt get me. She had enough people to satiate her hunger in the local area that traveling across the Atlantic would be a waste of energy, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt travel to her in one night. When we moved, I couldn‚Äôt sense her presence as much. The continual song was just a whisper in my mind. The dreams were more hazy and vague. It was so long since I‚Äôve known peace, and I knew this was the most peace I was going to get as long as she still lived.* 



*Things were fairly uneventful for around a decade. Factory work, family time. We were struggling financially, working long hours into mind-numbing exhaustion being the only way that we could keep our small living quarters. I still kept in contact with my family, notably Liam and my younger sister Rowan. Liam was still keeping track of her, either wanting to find a way to erase the telepathic hold she had on my mind or still chasing that chance of fame and fortune from the discovery of her or her eggs.* 



*I got a letter from Liam a month ago saying that he made the same horrible mistake of catching her gaze. It made me sick to my stomach reading those words on that piece of paper. Thankfully he took precautions due to witnessing the effects I had. How dare she. I learned through the years that the more I was enraged by her, the worse the voices got. The higher the desire got. The worse the dreams got. All of that went out the window after finding out she‚Äôs got her slimy claws etching dark fantasies and morbid desires into his brain. I tried calming down, thinking of what to do. Do I stay with my family in the safety of a different continent, or do I go over there and help him find a way to stop this wretched, watery wench?* 



*That night, I had a horrible dream. L√≠ Ban was sitting on her rock like usual, water surrounding her. She had her back turned to me this time, the only thing I could see was the long blonde locks and her shimmery, scaly rear. Normally she would stay in her alluring form to lure me in a lustful lull. The cold water reached my ankles as I stared at her with my fists clenched. I would normally catch my breath in these dreams, learning not to interact was the best way. Most of the dreams I would do anything but approach or talk to her, just looking at anything else but her commanding gaze as she watched me from her rock. But this was not the usual set-up. Her hair started to fall out in clumps as her skin started to loosen around her body. The grey matter that was her skin seemed to start breaking away as though it was chunks of wet dough. She turned around in a sickening grin, sharp teeth stained with blood. In her hands was what disturbed me the most. It was Connor‚Äôs head. My boy‚Äôs dismembered head was in her webbed clutches. His hazel eyes, cold and devoid of life as his pale skin was splattered with his own blood. How did she know I had a son? How did she even know what he currently looked like? That scaly bitch knows more than I thought. She saw my face drain of color and mouth widen in horrid shock. She snickered before digging her sharp nails into my son‚Äôs eye socket, light tearing and squishing sounds emanated from his lifeless face as she ripped his gorgeous eye from where it belonged and popped it into her mouth like a fucking piece of candy. I was filled with indescribable hatred that I did not know I could feel any deeper towards her than I did at that moment. I ran at her, wanting to strangle her gilled neck until it broke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fucking kill you!‚Äù I screamed reaching my arms out towards her. It was then I awoken to a heavy shove. I opened my eyes, seeing that my wife was sitting up from the bed panting and wide-eyed. I was clinging on the edge of the bed, almost falling over onto the floor. Seeing her so frightened of me of all people made me tremble. I slid down to the floor and curled into a ball. I didn‚Äôt care how pathetic I must have looked, my sweaty arms and torso grabbing in my legs as I started tearing up at the twisted dream. Maeve‚Äôs concern started to overcome her fear as she got up and hesitantly walked to the other side of the bed to see me in my cradled form. I started shaking after she asked me what‚Äôs wrong. All I could croak out was that I had a nightmare. I couldn‚Äôt say anything else.* 



*The next morning, I started to pack some essentials to leave. L√≠ Ban was never going to let me go. She got a hold of Liam‚Äôs mind and now she‚Äôs digging deeper into my own brain into depths I did not know she could even reach. This wasn‚Äôt a matter of survival and preservation for her, it was sadistic pleasure. I never wanted to drag my family into this insanity, but she wasn‚Äôt giving me much of a choice at this point. I wanted her dead. I wanted to gouge out her hypnotic glowing eyes and tear her throat into paste. I counted the little money that I had saved aside for myself. It was meant for personal savings or emergencies, but it was enough to get me to my destination. I told my family I had some business to take care of and that I would be back. Maeve looked skeptical, while Connor looked genuinely puzzled. I told them I‚Äôd hopefully return in a few months, that I was just going to help Liam with some things since there was past business that had to be taken care of in person. I was technically telling them the truth. I hugged them both before leaving. It was probably the tightest I hugged my son, the thought of his lifeless corpse filling me with more fear than the night I met L√≠ Ban.* 

*I am back with Liam now. I found this notebook again, grateful he saved what all I wrote. We‚Äôre going to begin our quest soon. Connor, I hope when this is all over that I can tell you why I did all that I did. Why I had to leave. If you find this and I was not lucky in my quest, I am so incredibly sorry. Your old man didn‚Äôt leave you for nothing. He left you for everything: the hope to reunite with you and your mother with not only the peace that this monster will never come between us again, but also the riches and blessings her treasured eggs can provide us will make this journey worth it. Even if she consumes and plagues my mind to insanity, my love for you and your mother will remain untouched."" (end of log)*

I found myself tearing up after reading this passage. There was not anything else written after it, leaving me to stare at this final page that had water droplets from long ago lightly smearing the ink. I didn‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I could give this to my dad to read as some sort of proof that his father‚Äôs intentions of leaving were of higher stakes than mere abandonment for foolish pursuits. But there was also the risk that he could feel worse. The last thing I wanted was to find my dad choking on his own vomit after drinking himself sick out of despair. I didn‚Äôt know how to predict the reaction he‚Äôd give. I decided to shove the box under the bed as I pondered my decision.

**The idea:**

We‚Äôre placing small digital screens inside local businesses (coffee shops, gyms, salons, etc.) that display rotating ads for other local businesses‚Äîkind of like a citywide digital bulletin board.

The goal is to help small business owners get more visibility around town without relying on social media algorithms or expensive online ads.

I‚Äôve cold-emailed/messaged around 100 small businesses in my city. A few responded, but very few actually followed through and sent over an ad‚Äîeven though I‚Äôm offering the service *completely free* while we‚Äôre getting started.

On the other side, I also need physical locations willing to host a screen. A couple have shown interest, but I haven‚Äôt placed any screens yet. I wanted to make sure people would even be willing to send over their ads.

To me, it feels like a good idea with potential but I‚Äôm not sure. Does this sound like something real businesses would actually find valuable?

I picked up:

* **Jinhao X750 Fountain Pen ‚Äî Shimmering Sands**
* **Sheaffer 100 Fountain Pen ‚Äî Coffee Edition (Limited Edition)**
* **Jinhao 993 Shark Fountain Pen**

And for inks, I went with:

* **Diamine Sunshine Yellow (30ml)**
* **Diamine Imperial Purple (30ml)**
* **Diamine Eau de Nil (30ml)**
* **Wearingeul Dracula (30ml)**
* **Endless Alchemy Mocha Mousse Delight (45ml)**

I‚Äôve already inked up the Sheaffer Coffee Edition with Endless Alchemy Mocha Mousse Delight (seemed fitting) and I‚Äôm loving how it writes so far.

On a more personal note, I‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety and depression lately, and getting into fountain pens, journaling, and ink collecting has been a small but real help. It gives me a moment of calm and something to look forward to. If anyone else here feels the same way, or if writing helps you too, feel free to reach out my DMs are open and I‚Äôm always willing to listen.

Also, I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions: which of these inks do you think would pair best with the Jinhao X750 and the Shark? Or do you have other favorites you like using with them?

1m0xbgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1m0xbgx/might_this_be_cfs/,Might this be CFS?,"So everything started a year and a half ago after I went through some adjusts on my anxiety medications (stopping diazepam, starting clonazepam, and others) and I just started feeling what I thought was the withdrawal symptoms at the time. Around 10 months ago I started feeling a little better and these episodes wouldn‚Äôt be so frequent and so severe, and for the past 10 months that‚Äôs how it has been going, less severe and lesse frequent, but I still feel this.

Now for what I feel, I don‚Äôt really know how to explain it, it feels like pain all over my body, but not like pain at touch, more like nerve pain, like my nerves are so sensitive I feel this 10x worse than someone normal. It comes and goes, some days I‚Äôm completely normal and feel normal and other days are so bad I think I‚Äôm actually dying.

I‚Äôve noticed that when I exercise (after) or push myself I get worse (same day or later), if I drink alcohol I get worse, if I drink coffee I get worse, I think these are some patterns I‚Äôve noticed.

Also I think stretching, like those morning stretches after you wake up, help the symptoms and help ease this weird pain feeling.

I don‚Äôt even know if I should call it pain, it‚Äôs like malaise, like unspecified, I can‚Äôt really describe it accurately to be honest, but I just know it feels so bad. There were some episodes I literally thought that was it and I would die because the unwell feeling was so so strong and it just wouldn‚Äôt go away no matter what. I feel like I don‚Äôt get these stronger ones anymore, at least not as intense, but I definitely get them.

Oh, something else I‚Äôve noticed is that maybe sometimes when I get stressed with something or someone, or I argue with someone, I might also feel worse.

Feels like it comes in waves. I might be fine for 3 or 4 days, only to feel like shit the next day. And even during the same day, I might feel bad for an hour or two, then it gets better, and then I feel bad again and it just goes on and on and on.

What do you guys think? Do you think this is it? Do you think this is what I might have?

If you have come all the way here, thank you for reading and for all help. Thank you.

TLDR: honestly don‚Äôt know what to type here because I really wish you could read my story. Anyways, I‚Äôve been feeling like shit on and off, exercise worsens it, alcohol and caffeine too, feels like nerve pain and like I‚Äôm literally dying sometimes and other times I‚Äôm like new.",1,1752622349.0,cfs,3,1.0,False

(Does everyone use a scale every time, or do you have another routine?)","I'm on day 3 (never had an espresso machine before, but have watched youtube videos)  
Current strategy:  Load beans into the grinder (Kingrinder K6) on scale until I'm in the 17-18 gram range.  I pull a shot (on a scale) to get an output of double whatever I weighed for the beans (so in the 34-36 gram range).  I then swap to another cup to extract the remaining water into.

It just has me wondering...does anyone just fill the brew chamber and pull the full thing?  Would that just be a longer shot, or would the last part of it be 'ruining' the espresso.  I'm just wondering if I'm doing it right or adding extra steps for no reason.  (I've been happy with my results so far...still tweaking the grind settings slightly).

Also: regarding coffee dosage...I noticed the sheet that came with it said to use ""between 15-17 grams"" but online it looks like more is fine for the pro 3, potentially up to 24?  I'm assuming the actual max depends on the coffee roast (as weight per volume can vary)  I just wanted to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong if I go over 17 grams (18 is the max I've done so far).

He wears a steel helmet with abundant scrapes and dents. He no longer needs it as he is back in Dresden, the city he left so long ago, but refuses to remove it, something so deeply ingrained in him over his time. His hair is short and unkempt. His face is clean shaven as is customary for those who need to wear a mask.

He walks off the platform and into the station. Everything looks just how it was when he was there last over three years ago now. Same brick walls, same marvelous pillars, same steeples. It may have looked the same but it is not really where he left from. No cheering or throwing flowers as he and his friends get on the train and are sent away. Yes the foundations and stones are the same but the spirit of the people and nation itself have eroded. Not many are seen and those who are are solemn and quiet. The man sits on a bench at the station to think for a moment. He supposes that those in France and Britain are probably coming home to crowds and celebrations. While yes every nation lost people it feels as though Germany's losses were most severe. They have no victory to take their minds off the friends, children, or fathers they‚Äôve had ripped away so quickly. There is only loss. That of the war, that of the soldiers, that of the civilians, that of the German pride which had carried them this far. Just loss.

No point dwelling on it now, and afterall he is back and should be happy for that at least¬† presumes the man as he gets up and continues on. Walking out of the station he looks for his old apartment. He saw it from a little while away. It was the same four stories of brick and mortar with a sign outfront simply with ‚ÄúApartment‚Äù across it. He walked inside to see a new clerk from when he was there previously. It was a girl, no older than their late twenties at most. She had a down expression and seemed to light up when the man entered through the doors. She was short with striking features, fair skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair put into a chignon. Something about her eyes stood out to him. It looked like an empty space behind them, one that had been vacant for some time but has finally come to terms and is ready to be filled.



‚ÄúHello sir, what may I have the pleasure of helping you with today?‚Äù



‚ÄúHow much is a room?‚Äù



‚Äú50 Marks a month.‚Äù



‚ÄúCertainly has steepened a bit.‚Äù Said the man sifting through his wallet and handing over the 50 Marks. ‚ÄúIs room 11 open, that was mine before I went off‚Äù



‚ÄúIndeed it is.‚Äù Said the clerk turning around to look for a key. She began to speak again with waning enthusiasm as she said, ‚ÄúA lot of the rooms opened up when this all started and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ let's just say the old owners aren‚Äôt coming back to fill them up. A lot of sad mothers around here.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúOh I know.‚Äù



‚ÄúHave you visited yours yet? They probably would like to know you‚Äôre back and ok.‚Äù Still looking through the drawers behind the counter.



‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt talked to them much since I came down here from Leipzig.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell no time like the present.‚Äù She said while handing over the key. ‚ÄúAnd what name would you like me to put that under again?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can put it under Friedrich K√∂hler, or just shorten it to Fritz.‚Äù



‚ÄúAlright you‚Äôre all set. Have a good day Mr. K√∂hler. I hope to see your face around.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you, likewise.‚Äù



Fritz walks up a flight of stairs. Even after being separated from his old residence for so long he remembers it all. Every chip in the paint, every slightly cracked brick, every grain in the banister, and the light hanging from the top of the stairwell. He makes his way to the room he called home before he went away. Inserting the key into the hole he twists it and with a creek the door opens. Looking around you‚Äôll see a small stove and cold water sink right at the entrance and going ahead you‚Äôll see a modest bed and chair in the opposite corner, the whole thing dimly lit by a few lights. He removes his coat, places his bag with his possessions under the sink, and collapses on to the bed. Many times he dreamed of a bed while away. On Fritz‚Äôs mental list he crosses out ‚ÄúBed‚Äù, now only ‚ÄúShower‚Äù and ‚ÄúPub‚Äù remain. Lucky enough for him the apartment has one of those two on the first floor right next to the restroom. That can be done in a moment once he is satisfied with laying down in the luxury of his bed.

The air of late November required him to return to his coat. With this he set back off, exiting the room, locking the door, and descending the stairs. Walking down the hall he found the bathhouse unoccupied to his pleasure. Within seven minutes Fritz emerged fresher than he had been in months. While no he was not spotless by any metric it was refreshing all the same. With a shirt now slightly dampened by his skin he returned quickly up the stairs to his room. He retched the pack he had carried to remove his items from it and make himself more settled in. He reached in and took out a notebook which he had documented a few experiences in, everything from describing Artillery barrages and assaults, to shooting at rats and bailing water.¬† A few photographs and a camera he had saved from a friend named Paul who was making a collection from all of the towns they went to during their time lay in his bag as well. One day Paul went on a scouting party to cut some British wire at Guillemont, and never returned to the German front. It‚Äôd be a shame and disrespect to Paul if he let his hard work get left behind, so Fritz took the camera and photos and finished the collection Paul started to honor him. A 37mm shell was one of the souvenirs Fritz kept. It had a design at the top with pedals sticking out at an angle, and little holes in the shell beneath each pedal. This was acquired on a raid in a British trench at Cambrai. As the old owner would not be advancing back to their old trench there was no point in letting it go to waste. A spare shirt and some socks had been provided by the army while the soldiers were handing most of their gear back. He was able to hold on to a mess kit that he was given. A few cigarettes in a tin box that had engravings of an iron cross and eagle he had received in 1915. Also in the box was an Iron Cross 2nd Class which he was awarded. Finally he had a match box, razor, standard issued knife, and a small sack with the rest of his pay in it. With now sprawled out on his chair he checked the time seeing it was now about seven p.m. After a couple more minutes enjoying his bed he left to find a place to drink.

Swiftly exiting the apartment Fritz began to walk in the direction that his old favorite pub was in. Walking beside the road he began to notice many shops or restaurants he used to enjoy now had shut doors and closed signs, and even then those that were open didn‚Äôt look in the best shape. The solemness of the mournful city returns. People quietly walk to and fro, uninterested in the doings of others. There is the same feeling of loss permeating in the air as before. Fritz pushes it all out of his mind, afterall he is back and should enjoy being back. A quick ten minute stroll later he arrived at the pub ‚ÄúStadtkrug‚Äù. Opening the doors a yeasty aroma of freshly brewed beer is smelt. Many people sit and talk in small groups, and many others sit alone. Walking up he orders a Pilsner and joyfully anticipates its arrival.¬†

The bartender returns to his stool. He seemed to be in his thirties and by the hollow wooden thump against the ground made every time he takes a step, it‚Äôs evident that he got out of the war early. Fritz couldn‚Äôt help but let out an empty chuckle and silently think to himself ‚Äúlucky bastard.‚Äù He grasped the drink in its cage of glass and slowly pressed it to his lips, ready to bask in its full glory. When he first left he was hardly at the age to enjoy drinking, especially with the example of his father still fresh in his memory and his vow to never touch alcohol. This quickly dissipated. When every day is a miracle you, naturally, wish to do everything as soon as possible in case you don‚Äôt have the chance. Him and Karl had a scavenger hunt to see who could complete everything faster, which included getting drunk and enjoying a woman. If you ever met Karl you know that he had no problem with the alcohol, while Fritz had his luck with the French women, a period of which he looks back on with shame. All the older soldiers said how awful the ration beer was.

¬†‚ÄúWhat is this trench water! Back in Berlin we had real beer. ‚ÄúMaking beer out of potatoes‚Äù who do they think we are, Ivans? Sooner or later they‚Äôll have us drinking that disgusting backyard brew the Kosaken tries to pass for alcohol.‚Äù

¬†He didn‚Äôt drink it. He wanted a first experience that truly encapsulated the glories and culture, not whatever that was.¬† Since Karl was clearly not going to complete his part, Fritz figured he might as well finish the race that was no longer competitive of course.¬†

With a slight rise in elevation the golden Pilsner flowed into his mouth, and in a very short time he had officially won the competition. It was not how Fritz imagined it. During the war all of his older comrades talked about how the first thing they would do when they got home, before reuniting with their families which they held so dearly, was to stop by the pub. Fritz was so deeply excited to try this for himself, but now it seemed so flat or dry. The enjoyment and euphoria that was anticipated simply didn‚Äôt appear. Dismay washed him over and he began to lose focus on the world around him. His eyes were open yes, but he was not seeing anything in front of him. His mind was thinking no thought, and for a second it was as if he didn‚Äôt exist. Such bliss can be found in non-existence sometimes.

He felt a hand on his shoulder. A damn frog eater! He jumped forward, hitting into the wall of the trench held together by sticks, beams, and pure determination. His arm tore through the air with a raging fury to grab his shovel. In one swift motion he brought it to his head level and swung it at the Franzm√§nner‚Äôs head. The ensuing sounds were all too familiar, the transition from pressing into skin to hitting solid bone, to feeling it break away and shatter. Some pieces went out the side, some deeper into his head where the blade continued to push them deeper until it was solidly entrenched in the man's head. At least that's what he would have felt. What he thought he felt if he had his spade. If he was in France. If he wasn‚Äôt in the bar staring into a man's wide eyes.



‚ÄúI see, still war weary. Don‚Äôt worry I was the same when I first came back. They say it shows weakness but I say it shows we‚Äôre just ready for a fight wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù He pulled over a stool from further down the counter. ‚ÄúWhat's your name?‚Äù



‚ÄúFriedrich.‚Äù He responded with the cold blank tone of one who still isn't sure of their exact surroundings.



‚ÄúWell Friedrich it‚Äôs nice to meet you, I'm Hans. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of the Freikorps.‚Äù Said the stranger with a pause and look indicating to Fritz he should respond.



‚ÄúI don't know. Like the old ones? Like The War of Liberation‚Ä¶ something with Napoleon I think.‚Äù He said in a state of unthawing from his episode, completely uncaring of what this man has to say.



‚ÄúNo no no, the new one. Me and a bunch of ex-German soldiers are putting together a group, a militia of sorts.‚Äù



‚ÄúListen sir, the war is over. It‚Äôs done, you heard what the politicians said the same as I did. I just want my old life back, *not* the trenches again.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh I heard the politicians alright. Damn traders like it more, selling us down the river, being walked on by the French and British, listening to the American lies. They‚Äôre German, they win, what don't they understand?‚Äù



‚ÄúI guess so, hell I mean we got pretty close at least. Wasn‚Äôt there something about the Navy too?‚Äù



‚ÄúThem, those sailors, the jews, liberals, oh and don‚Äôt get me started on the communists! The Spartacists, taking the high road, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like war,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go on strike like the Brits and Frenchies,‚Äù ‚ÄúI want more money so I'm going to stop working so the soldiers putting their asses on the line for us run out of ammo and die in the French mud!‚Äù They piss me off to the ends of the Earth! I could only think what I‚Äôd do if I had one right here.‚Äù



‚ÄúI think one of my buds got a letter about that from his girl. Did they really just stop working, even on war materials? In a time like that? I‚Äôve seen men get gunned down, torn to pieces because they didn't have enough ammo. It‚Äôs always when you have a clear shot on their officer that you find you‚Äôre missing a bullet.‚Äù



‚ÄúExactly! Give us a few weeks, no, days even and we‚Äôd have been in Paris. I mean look at you, with *you* in our army clearly it‚Äôs not the quality of soldiers keeping us down. We did so much in so little time that if they hadn't turned on us at our moment of triumph we would have won for sure. Think how many of our pals would still be alive if they hadn‚Äôt leashed us and pulled us away, kicking and streaming, from Paris.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, what's this Freikorps‚Äô goal anyway?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell to protect the Germans of course. Our people, our identity, our unity. They‚Äôre coming for us, the Tommies, the Frogs, the Bolschewiken, and the Amerikanische mercenaries! Even on the inside they‚Äôre trying to cave us, the damned Spartacists! In Latvia, where our knights first landed those ages ago, they're still fighting to keep out the Red Pests. They spread like a plague and infect everything they touch, waves of them. They‚Äôre doing the best they can, but it certainly wouldn't hurt if a few thousand hardened veteran soldiers such as yourself. You‚Äôre the prime example of a Z√§her Hund you know. A true front-line pig, a real man, a guy who comes back again and again and again no matter how much is thrown at him.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow would one sign up for this organization if they were to go relieve the struggling garrisons in the Baltic, to protect the innocent Germans from the murderous Reds of course?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell right here in Dresden we have a head of the Freikorps Hasse. I‚Äôll try to get into contact with Hauptmann Waldemar Pabst. He‚Äôs one of us, a real man. In two days I can ask him to meet you at the Residenzschloss, he‚Äôll point you to where you can go to reach the Baltics.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you Hans. What about you? Are you going to the Baltic?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm planning on staying here, probably going to keep an eye on the socialist in Leipzig. They act up one bit, and I‚Äôll show them that despite their best efforts I still have at least one bullet left for each of them.‚Äù



‚ÄúAlright then, I best be heading out.‚Äù Said Fritz, pushing off his legs with his hands to stand up off his seat.¬†



‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù was the response given by Hans.



With a slight grunt he lifted himself and reached out his hand, slightly sticky from the Pilsner, which Hans didn't seem to mind as he swiftly and firmly grasped his hand and gave a firm handshake before walking off to the door. Fritzed hollered for the bartender to return as he handed him a portion of the leftover pay that he had brought with him. With that he turns and walks out of Stadtkrug‚Äôs double doors.

Walking out into the fresh November air, the coldness he had felt before seemed less piercing, to the point where he was able to remove his coat for the remainder of his walk. Something about the atmosphere had changed. Everything seemed slightly brighter than before, as if the darker clouds looming over the city had begun to subside, if only over Fritz. No one was stirring, not at this hour. There was something that seemed to push him forward, something in his step allowing him to walk more upright and powerful than on the trip there. This was not unnoticed by Fritz. He began to think of what has changed. Perhaps it was the stars providing better illumination, or was it a shift within himself? Was it the conversation with Hans, did he just need a comrade in this trying time? Possibly. Or was it the destination that he was now moving towards? Yes, on the trip to the pub he had an ending location but not a path. The previous destination was one that was unimportant and had no effect. Nothing would change if he went or did not go. Nothing would change if he went now or years from now, but now he has a deadline and a group that wants him, no, needs him like Hans said. In some way, the screws put on him by his new limitations and requirements almost willingly forces him to move forward compared to an unstructured path. Water in a river will move further and more vigorously than water in a lake as the strict constraints of the banks on either side force it to go in a direction, while a lake has no limitations, no structure, but no movement. That must be it.

It was that, or it was a feeling of running rather than being herded, running from what he knew lay inevitably on the other side of this ordeal. There was a feeling inside of him, a nibble at the back of his brain that he knew a dark shadow had cast him over. He pushed it away but could feel it like a bubble in his head, not having spilled into his thoughts yet, but taking up room in a tense balance where he wishes anything but to disturb it. But these are an issue for another time.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following day went by slowly, at a pace that could make even the most patient of saints wish to tear out their eyes. This was the time when Fritz truly realized his old life was gone. There was nothing to do but sleep or walk around, so that's what Fritz did. Going down the stairs he passed the lady working the entrance again. She shot him a smile and asked,



‚ÄúWhere are you off to? Just a morning walk?‚Äù



‚ÄúIndeed I am. I figured there's nothing else much to do around here so I might as well.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre bored and need something to do, would you mind getting a coffee with me? In two days when the weekend starts maybe?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI would like that.‚Äù He responded as a small smile began to creep on his face. ‚ÄúWhere were you thinking?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt really think it through. I figured I should say something before the opportunity slipped away.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow about Kreutzkamm? With you in the shop, the pastries would be the second sweetest thing there.‚Äù



She began to blush and let out the softest, cutest giggle Fritz believed he‚Äôd ever heard. In that moment she was the only thing that mattered to him.



‚ÄúWell I wouldn‚Äôt want to stop you, go on your walk, I‚Äôll be here when you get back.‚Äù



‚ÄúWill do.‚Äù



¬†He exited the apartment with a slight raise in his posture. He had one of the cigarettes he had salvaged as well as his box of matches, and began his walk. He took the cigarette, placing it between his teeth as he fumbled through his pocket looking for where he had placed the matches. He from top to bottom and felt them protruding from inside his coat. He pulled out the box and taking a match pressed it hard and quick against the striking strip. Nothing. It was probably the rain that had dampened them a while ago, maybe some of the phosphorus dissolved, if that happens. Maybe he just got a bad hit, he pondered to himself. He tried again, still nothing. On the third the match erupted into flames, just as they were meant to. He moved it towards the cigarette until it was smoking sufficiently. He watched the match. It burned bright with a vigor and passion, but lost it as time matched forward until it was still lit, but not enthusiastic. Perhaps it could hold on, keep burning, if just for a few seconds longer, but quickly and abruptly the wind stifled it, so Fritz dropped it and continued on. It was forgotten along the path of something greater than itself now.

As one strolled down the paths composed of stone bricks you couldn't help but notice the humorous situation they found themselves in where everyone needed so many workers that they didn't have, that there were no real jobs left. That was except for one. A paper was plastered on a wall near where he first arrived back to his city. It was stained an unkept yellow color that so often happens to paper left to the weathering of nature. On the top in big, bold letters which he could still just slightly see the letters pushed in from when the press had made its imprint said ‚ÄúRailway Workers Are Needed!‚Äù Under that a depiction of a large coal fueled engine chugging along forcefully in the back. In the foreground were six men, well built, with hammers. Possibly a few with pickaxes as well, it was hard to tell. They were swinging down on a track parallel to the one the train was running on. Under that in slightly smaller letters was ‚ÄúApply! Work and good pay! To apply, go to Dresden Hauptbahnhof.‚Äù He stood staring at it. Contemplating its words. He stood long enough that his left ankle began to act up again like it has since the splinter pierced it, so he leaned to the right. He inhaled a breath of his cigarette smoke and continued thinking. It says good pay after all, and look, this job has no killing involved. Perhaps he should change his mind on this whole Freikorps thing? Maybe he shouldn‚Äôt go to the Residenzschloss. Yet again he had heard Hans‚Äô words. Also he lacked any experience in the workforce, despite shooting and killing of course, that he was well versed in. It would be best just to sleep on it and in the morning he will make his final judgment.",3,1752622039.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Just like[ last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ducati/comments/1e6350r/ducatis_dre_racetrack_academy_at_laguna_seca/), Ducati hosted a track day for Ducatisti in California ‚Äî with a few changes compared to 2024.

**What Stayed the Same**

* **Track Time:**¬†Multiple sessions from 9‚ÄØAM to 5‚ÄØPM.
* **Pro Riders:**¬†MotoAmerica riders joined in and rode alongside participants.
* **Timing:**¬†Held the Monday immediately following the MotoAmerica round at Laguna Seca.
* **Ducati Staff:**¬†The Ducati North America team was excellent and kept the atmosphere positive all day.
* **Ducatisti participation**: Just like last year, the event sold out quickly ‚Äî a good sign that Ducati will continue hosting these events in the future.
* **Pirelli Support:**¬†Pirelli was on-site again, providing tire services. You also had the option to pre-order tires and have them installed right before the session begins.
* **Photos:**¬†Free photos of you riding Laguna Seca were included.
* **Food & Drinks:**¬†Complimentary lunch, snacks, coffee, and drinks were part of the package.
* **Guest Pass:**¬†You could bring a guest to watch the event (non-rider) for an extra $70.

**What Changed from 2024**

* **No Instruction:**¬†Unlike last year, there were no group or one-on-one coaching sessions. MotoAmerica riders didn‚Äôt provide instruction either ‚Äî which explains the next point.
* **Lower Cost:**¬†Without instruction, the event fee dropped to around $750.
* **No Swag:**¬†Last year‚Äôs hat, t-shirt, and microfiber towel weren‚Äôt included this time.
* **No Test Rides:**¬†In 2024, the premium package (around $5,000) let you test ride nearly every Ducati in the lineup ‚Äî not offered this year.
* **Garage Spots:**¬†In 2024, your garage spot was guaranteed with registration. This year, it was first come, first served.

[With the model restrictions lifted, more Ducatisti were able to show off their beautiful bikes.](https://preview.redd.it/zzlhjbhhe4df1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75d9304e65be8e3252740ccedbf0dea7baa5a7ac)

**What Improved from 2024**

* Last year‚Äôs event was limited to select models ‚Äî mainly Panigales, Streetfighters, Desmo RRs, Superleggeras, and Multistrada RS. This time, all Ducati models were welcome ‚Äî a smart move. One rider even pushed a DesertX to its limits around Laguna Seca, which was great to see.

**Highlights**

* You think you‚Äôre doing fine ‚Äî then [Kayla Yakov](https://kaylayaakov.com), on a Multistrada, laps a pack of Panigales and Streetfighters. Priceless.
* Just when you think your motorcycle obsession is out of hand, you park next to someone who owns three times as many bikes and has enough gear to put a pro pit crew to shame. Suddenly, you realize ‚Äî nope, you‚Äôre totally fine.

[Ducati envy is definitely a thing ‚Äî no doubt about it.](https://preview.redd.it/dgguseq8q4df1.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5904f4d09152e97d336ba62018c29c4edac50957)

**Overall**

Despite the changes, it was still an excellent event and one I‚Äôd recommend to any Ducatista, no matter their skill level. I am looking forward to next year.",5,1752621953.0,Ducati,0,0.86,False

1m0x4am,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m0x4am/aita_for_reporting_my_boss_and_then_never/,AITA for reporting my boss and then never returning,"Hey, first time writing on Reddit and excited to hear from all my fellow potatoes.

I never thought this would happen to me and I am ashamed to say I didn‚Äôt defend myself as I should have. Pre-warning this is long and I have changed all the names of those involved.

I (F31) started a new job in a niche industry, can‚Äôt mention here as it is a very well known company within the industry. I was an office worker in a small office with only one other office girl, we‚Äôll call here Ali (F45) and next door to us was HR with only one HR rep, we‚Äôll call her Liz (59). The three of us worked well together, Ali was an amazing trainer and all around lovely woman - Liz was lovely too but had moments where she could be a bit nippy, if she thought you should do something differently she would tell you in a falsely sweet way and then avoid you for the rest of the day but didn‚Äôt really bother me as Ali would tell me I was doing things the right way and just to ignore her.

Anyway, I was with the company for about a month when the manager of our department, lets call her Rachel informed us that she had hired a supervisor/manager for the office to liaise with Rachel and make sure work was getting done efficiently - which in my opinion was unnecessary as we were a tiny office and were getting on great, but I was new so for all I knew this was for the best. Spoiler Alert; it most definitely wasn‚Äôt!

We waited a month before the new office manager started, bouncing theories of what she would be like and what she would bring to the table and I was excited to have another girl in the office. I organised her new desk and made sure she had everything she would need, even finding different coloured lanyards so she had a choice for her favourite. Finally, the dreaded day arrived and in walked the new office manager Kay (57).

Right off the bat Kay didn‚Äôt seem very keen on me, as she was introduced to everyone she shook all hands except for mine, my poor arm hung out awkwardly for a solid 10 seconds before falling to my side. I chose to think she was just nervous and maybe didn‚Äôt realise I had extended my hand as well, but I was wrong!
As soon as Rachel was gone Kay decided to make the office her own and started with the most criminally offensive decision‚Ä¶ she moved our snack spot! It was a spot that rested above my desk - and the best because I only needed to reach up and I was in snack heaven. She started by asking me what they were, I explained that people would gift us sweets and biscuits and we left them there so anyone could have some - she then told me I should keep my personal sweets in my desk and not out in the open as it didn‚Äôt look good‚Ä¶ guys I was taken aback, like had I not just explained so I tried again - still not listening and then the third time Ali walked in and explained and suddenly the sweets were allowed out but had to move by the printer. Potatoes, I was so confused!! Like, did I just imagine that? I decided again that maybe she was just nervous and chalked it up to her first day. I know, I‚Äôm an idiot looking back lol.

A week later was when I realised Kay‚Äôs true colours. It was lunch time and I always used my lunch break to nip home and let my dog out and spend a little time with the adorable furball. On this particular day the workshop boys were loading a lorry and decided the best place to do so was across the car park entrance/exit, I was trapped and couldn‚Äôt physically leave. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and the office was very strict with taking lunch breaks at specific times, so what did I do? I ran to Kay thinking my manager would be able to fix this, get the boys to move or give me a slightly later break - I was wrong. I explained to her my situation and she shrugged and told me, ‚Äòguess you‚Äôll just need to stay here then.‚Äô I was shocked, I told her I needed to let my dog out which was the whole point in taking this job, having the time to let him out and see him during lunch breaks, she got annoyed when I told her that and told me, ‚Äòjust get someone else to let him out then!‚Äô My flabbers were gasted. I even suggested a later lunch and she instantly turned it down telling me I should have made better arrangements, like I knew the guys were going to block my car in or something? 
Don‚Äôt worry petty potatoes, I made a call to my friend and luckily she was able to let out my dog and he didn‚Äôt have to wait until I got home but I didn‚Äôt get any lunch as I didn‚Äôt have any food with me. From that day on I tried to be cautious of Kay.

It only got worse, I have never hated a manager as much as I hated this Manager! She was vile! On two occasions she had a hissy fit at me and Ali. The first was in her second week, Ali and I were talking about an excel spreadsheet and if the other had filled it out, a conversation that lasted about 30 seconds. Kay asked what we were talking about, Ali began to explain and then Kay exploded about not knowing and how we weren‚Äôt teaching her things properly and how she didn‚Äôt like not knowing what we were doing at all times and then stormed out of the room leaving us in shocked silence and mouths agape. Imagine someone going from 0-100 in less than a second, that was Kay. When she returned she just sat down and started typing away without a word.
The second time she flipped out was because‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶ Ali and I were working quietly and just getting on with things? She broke the silence going off about how she didn‚Äôt like the tension in the room and how we thought she was an awful person and she wasn‚Äôt and she just wants things to run smoothly. Guys, I had to fight the temptation to say if she wanted the tension to go away all she had to do was leave lol. Ali was a better person than I fortunately and she asked if we could talk about what was happening, but Kay shut her down and told her she didn‚Äôt want to talk to us and just wanted to get away for a bit and left the building. Again we were left in shocked silence. And once again when Kay eventually came back she just sat at her desk, typed away and said nothing.

Now I bet your wondering what HR, who were right next door with the door left wide open were doing while a manager still in her probation period was having hissy fits and storming out of the office - well the answer to that would be nothing! Liz would conveniently go deaf when Kay had her outbursts and made us feel about as big as a worm. 

Lucky for Ali this was the extent of the bullying she got from Kay. I was not so lucky! I‚Äôm not sure what I did to rub this woman the wrong way but it had to be bad for the way she treated me. 

A few of the things she did included:

1. Accusing me of coming in late for shifts, we have a clock in system that showed I was always in five minutes early, she then back tracked and said I was always the last person in though and that didn‚Äôt show good incentive - like I can telepathically tell when the others would be in
2. Gave me in trouble for listening to music while organising a storage cupboard because what if a director walked in‚Ä¶ to a storage cupboard?
3. Wrote me up for requesting a holiday too late, you‚Äôre supposed to ask 7 days in advance and I requested 5 days before, a conversation maybe but a full write up!?
4. Pulled me up for inappropriate talk in the work place, when I asked what inappropriate talk it was she told me it was cheesecake? CHEESECAKE!!! 
I asked her one day if she liked cheesecake cause I was going to make a mini kinder cheesecake for everyone in the office! That was the inappropriate conversation!! (That same day, she brought up a recent tragedy where an ill man jumped from a car ferry and hadn‚Äôt been found and to the horror of both me and Ali, Kay was trying to bounce her theories of this tragedy off us in the middle of the office - but cheesecake was an inappropriate work convo!)
5. Gave me into trouble because I wasn‚Äôt finishing tasks on time, guys she wasn‚Äôt assigning me any tasks!! How can I finish something on time that doesn‚Äôt exist?
6. Turning the lights out on me if I was in the bathroom, we‚Äôre the only girls in the building so it‚Äôs very obvious when we go!
7. If I walked into the office mid conversation she would stop talking and if I tried to join in she would interrupt and tell me to get on with work.
8. Having me count a PPE storage cupboard over 5 times a week, even though we had the only keys and would know if something had been given out.

That was only a handful of some of the things she did. Ali couldn‚Äôt take the tension Kay created in the office anymore and decided to leave. She gave her notice, which happened far too quickly and then she was gone. It was only us left and I couldn‚Äôt stand it! With Ali gone the bullying and harassment just got worse and crying in the toilets became a regular occurrence for me - it may as well have been scheduled into my daily tasks at that point. But I got a lucky break and managed to land a job in another company and as soon as I got the offer I handed in my notice to Kay. (This was only 1 week after Ali had left) 

At first Kay seemed buzzing that I was going, which kind of proved my theory that she didn‚Äôt like me. But as soon as she informed Rachel, who must have been raging that they were losing me so soon after Ali especially as they hadn‚Äôt even filled her role yet, Kay got mean again. I was determined to work my notice period but the last straw happened and I couldn‚Äôt anymore!

The printer broke and we called our IT guy Cian over to fix it, I get along well with Cian as we are both huge nerds and enjoy chatting with one another. Cian comes and as we are both working we are chatting away, Kay had been to a meeting and when she returned she did her usual sat down without so much as a hello to either of us, but our convo stops as I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble for ‚Äòinappropriate work talk‚Äô again. 
Cian leaves and Liz pops her head out of her office and ‚Äòkindly‚Äô asks I don‚Äôt shout over to the IT guy when he‚Äôs here and then closes her door. I turn to Kay and apologise before letting her know I wasn‚Äôt shouting, just talking to Cian as we both worked. She then snaps at me to watch my attitude and to stop while I‚Äôm ahead of myself and tells me I shouldn‚Äôt be talking to anyone who enters the office and should just stay quiet.

It finally happened petty potatoes, 3 months of bullying and harassment from this vile woman and I had snapped! I messaged Rachel and requested a meeting immediately, grabbed my stuff and drove to her office. And I told her everything! Of the mental abuse and bullying being the real reason I was leaving, about the bogus things I was being pulled up for, being told I can‚Äôt talk to people in the office or at all apparently and I even told on Kay and Liz for their coffee Skives - where they would go to ‚Äòmake a coffee‚Äô and spend the next 30-40 minutes gossiping about the rest of us in the canteen. I even told her that Kay didn‚Äôt know how to make the coffee-that‚Äôs right, turned out the real reason Kay didn‚Äôt like me being last in is cause the first person had to make the coffee in the morning and she didn‚Äôt know how despite having been shown numerous times by me and Ali. It was easy, scoop the coffee and add water - that‚Äôs how unqualified for the role she was!

To say Rachel was shocked was an understatement, she apologised profusely and asked why I hadn‚Äôt gone to HR? Which I told her was hard to do when HR was so close and pally with Kay and had already been ignoring her behaviour. Again she was shocked they had. She assured me that they would look into Kay‚Äôs behaviour and that from then on Rachel would stay in the office to monitor her abilities closely. She then offered me the best thing in the world at that moment, that I could go home, not have to come in again and would still be paid for my notice period! I was over the moon and accepted immediately! As I left Rachel hugged me and was sad to see me leave as I was a hard worker and had done a lot in the short time I was there, but understood why I felt I had to. I was sad to go as I enjoyed the work, but the mental torture of working for someone like Kay was not worth it!

So I left that day, enjoyed a week of relaxation at home with my dog talking about as much cheesecake as I wanted lol. I started my new job last week and couldn‚Äôt be happier with my new job, I get to work with my guy best friend and my managers are the loveliest people in the world who love hearing about my dog and are hoping if I talk about baked goods enough I‚Äôll bring some in haha.

Kay is still working there as far as I‚Äôm aware, but I will update if that changes.

Anyway guys, AITA for reporting my boss for everything at the very last second and leaving the job that day to never return again?

Morning: A travel day. The body feels recovered from the match. My wellness score is 8.9/10. The 0.1 deduction is for sleeping on a mattress with a suboptimal firmness rating. At breakfast, Mack Hansen passed my table. ""You disappeared quickly last night, Benny,"" he said, with a wide grin. ""Missed you doing karaoke."" I registered the comment. Karaoke is a public display of inefficiency. I gave a slight, dismissive smile. ""Had to begin the recovery protocols, mate. Big week."" This is a satisfactory and believable answer. The truth is the function was a loud, distracting environment and therefore detrimental to my preparation. I left at 22:45, precisely 30 minutes after the official dinner concluded.

Afternoon: The flight from Adelaide to Brisbane was unremarkable. I was seated next to Henry Pollock. He attempted to engage me in conversation about the ""vibe"" in the camp. I gave him monosyllabic answers until he put his headphones on. The youth of today have a misplaced faith in the power of ""vibes."" I spent the 2 hour, 10 minute flight reviewing my own performance data from the AUNZ game on my tablet. The arrival of more replacement players‚ÄîTom Clarkson, and the Scottish trio for cover‚Äîwas announced. More variables. More bodies in the training facility. It creates logistical challenges for the kit men.

Evening: Checked into the Brisbane hotel. The room is a standard layout. The keycard is reassuringly responsive. I unpacked immediately. Left side for training wear, right side for casual wear, supplements arranged alphabetically on the desk. My work here is done for the day. I have consumed 3.2 litres of water.

14 July 2025 ‚Äì Brisbane

Morning: A heavy training session. The humidity was noticeable. The focus was on defensive cohesion ahead of the Test. I observed Jack Conan closely. He is powerful in contact, a reliable ""traffic carrier"" as the analysts call it. It is a one-dimensional strength. Predictable. He sweats profusely, which I find distracting. My own output was optimal. Every drill was executed with precision. My heart rate did not exceed 188 bpm during the high-intensity blocks, which is within my target zone.

Afternoon: We were given a few hours of downtime. Many of the squad went for coffee or to walk around the city. This seems an inefficient use of a recovery window. I remained in my room. I connected my laptop to the television and watched a film. The Accountant (2016). I find the protagonist, Christian Wolff, to be a case study in focus and process. A man with a unique skill set who finds comfort in logic and the successful completion of a task, unburdened by social convention. The ending is unnecessarily sentimental, but the core of the character is sound.

Evening: A media report appeared on my tablet. Conan‚Äôs interview. He talks about the ""unbelievably special"" atmosphere and how this is the ""best few weeks of his career."" This is emotional hyperbole. This tour is not a holiday. It is a sequence of problems to be solved. Then I read Pollock‚Äôs quotes. ""We want to come here and be the best Lions team ever... 3-0 is definitely on the table."" Such pronouncements are naive. They are outcomes, not processes. To speak of the outcome before the process is complete is a rookie error. Farrell will have noted it.

15 July 2025 ‚Äì Brisbane

Morning: The final full training session before the Test team is named tomorrow. There is a tension in the air that the others try to mask with forced laughter. I find it clarifying. The coaches ran several different back-row combinations. When I was at No. 8, the ball retention at our rucks was 100%. When Conan was at No. 8, it was 96%. A small, but statistically significant, delta. These are the facts that matter.

Afternoon: In the gym, I saw Dan Sheehan working on the Wattbike. He wasn‚Äôt listening to music. There was no wasted motion. Just the rhythmic, mechanical piston of his legs and the quiet hum of the machine. His focus is absolute. He, too, is in a selection battle. He understands what is required. We passed each other on the way to the stretching area. A brief nod was exchanged. A complete conversation took place.

Evening: I sit in my room. The dilemma for the coaches is simple. The articles frame it as a choice between two styles. Conan: the lineout option, the traffic carrier. Or me: pace, footwork, a higher turnover threat. One is a blunt instrument from a bygone era. The other is a modern, precision tool. The logical choice is clear. They have all the data. I have provided them with nothing but clean data points for five matches. My job is done. Tomorrow, they will make their decision. I expect them to make the correct one.

1m0x207,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m0x207/the_creature_watched_our_farm_every_night/,The Creature Watched Our Farm Every Night,"Returning here after so long, it feels like I'm stepping into a place forgotten by the world. The land is dry, cracked, covered in yellowed weeds that no one tends anymore. The barn is falling apart, and the house‚Ä¶ well, the house is still standing, but it doesn't feel like a home. It just watches in silence.

My name doesn't matter. What matters is what happened in this place. My family lived here for three generations. My grandfather built the fence with his own hands. My father planted the cornfield that fed us for years. And I‚Ä¶ I was just the kid who grew up running between the sheds, never understanding that this land would one day take more than it could offer.

When I was little, I thought nothing bad could happen here. This was New Mexico, a land of hot sun, clear skies, and nights filled with crickets and stars. The farm was miles from the nearest town, surrounded by silent deserts and hills. At night, the darkness was absolute. There were no streetlights, no neighbors, just the sound of animals and the wind whispering through the dry trees.

My parents were always hard workers. They woke before the sun, tended to the animals, and kept the crops alive even through the harshest summers. My mother did everything with a kind of quiet faith. My father was more practical, always saying that folks who work the land don't have time for nonsense.

For a long time, everything seemed to follow the same rhythm. Seasons came and went. Harvests varied, animals got sick now and then, but nothing out of the ordinary. Until that summer. The summer that changed everything. When I think about it now, everything seems drier, quieter, more‚Ä¶ watched.

At the time, I didn't have words for it. It was just a strange feeling in my gut. A discomfort I couldn't explain. Like something was different, even if the days seemed normal. I'd wake up and do the same things. Feed the chickens, help my father in the orchard, listen to my mother humming inside the house. But something had changed. And no one talked about it.

I was 13 years old. Not a child anymore, but I didn't truly understand the world either. And still, I felt it. I felt that this farm, this land that had raised my grandfather and sustained my parents, was about to reveal something that should never have been discovered. And once revealed, it couldn't be ignored.

Today, decades later, I've come back. Not to start over, but to understand. To try to see what we left behind, or rather, what remained after we left. Because, no matter how much time has passed, there's something here that hasn't aged. Something that watches me just as it did before. Something that never left. And now it knows I've returned.

The first signs didn't seem frightening. They were small things, easy to ignore. A missing egg here, a chicken that refused to leave the coop there. My father blamed coyotes or raccoons, animals that always prowled the area on hot nights. But even at that age, I felt something was wrong.

The change started with the animals' behavior. The dogs stopped barking like they used to. Instead, they'd stand near the door, ears lowered, staring into the darkness outside. The chickens, which usually ran freely in the yard at dawn, began to huddle silently in the corners of the coop. The horses would get agitated for no reason, snorting and pawing the ground, as if something were circling them.

One morning, I went to feed the animals and found feathers scattered across the corral. No body, no bloodstain, just clean feathers as if a bird had been snatched from the ground and carried away without a struggle. My father shrugged and said a bird of prey had probably taken advantage of a distraction. But the way he avoided my eyes told me he wasn't so sure either.

Gradually, other things began to happen. Sometimes, I'd see something moving in the cornfield. A shadow between the rows, low and fast, that vanished before I could focus. At night, we'd hear strange noises outside. Dry snaps, light footsteps on the porch, a faint scratching on the side of the house that stopped as soon as anyone approached.

My father started locking everything up earlier. Until then, leaving the back door open was normal. We knew everyone around, and safety had never been an issue out here. But he started closing windows, chaining the coop, reinforcing the barn with extra wood. When I asked why, he just replied, ""There's something big out in the desert."" And that was all.

My mother, on the other hand, reacted differently. She was religious, but had never really shown it much. Now, she started placing sprigs of rue in the windows, coarse salt near the doors, and began to pray in a low voice whenever the sun started to set. I caught her once writing strange symbols on pieces of paper and hiding them behind the furniture. When I asked what it was, she just said, ""Protection."" And asked me not to touch them.

During the day, everything seemed normal. But as soon as the sun vanished behind the hills, the farm changed.

\*\*\*

The heat remained strong, but the wind died down. There were no crickets, no owls, no sound of rustling leaves. Just a suffocating silence. As if the world was holding its breath.

There was one particular night that never left my mind. I was sitting on the porch with my father. He was drinking black coffee and smoking a cigarette he said he'd quit years ago. The sky was clear, cloudless, and the cornfield swayed slightly in the distance. Then, we both heard a noise coming from the corral. It was a deep, muffled sound, like a low grunt.

We both stood up at the same time. My father went to the hook and grabbed his shotgun. He didn't say a word. I followed him in silence, my heart pounding. When we got there, there was nothing. The animals were restless, but unharmed. He walked around the barn and found something that made him stop. A circle of footprints on the dry ground‚Äîthree toes, wide and deep, with long claws. But the marks stopped in the middle of nowhere. As if the thing had vanished into thin air.

""Did you see that?"" I asked. He nodded, but replied, ""Don't tell your mother.""

I went back to bed that night, but I didn't sleep. Instead, I lay there, staring at the ceiling, my mind silently racing. It wasn't just fear. It was something deeper. A feeling that our home, this farm that had always protected us, was becoming something else. As if we were being invaded. But not by men. By something that left no traces. Something that knew how to wait. Something that‚Ä¶ watched.

It was after that silent night by the barn that everything intensified. As if the thing knew we were starting to notice. And decided to show more. Not directly, but with signs clear enough that no one could pretend it was just paranoia anymore.

The chickens started dying. Not all at once, but one a night. Always the same way. No scratches, but their eyes glazed over and their bodies dry, as if the life had been sucked out of them. Each morning, my father buried another one. At first, he'd still mumble some explanation, like heat or disease. Then, he'd just grab the shovel and head straight to the back of the property.

The footprints also became more frequent. Always those elongated three toes, like a giant bird's, but deeper and more widely spaced. They appeared near the barn, the corral, even near the porch. They never followed a straight line. It was as if the thing walked in circles, observing, testing the limits. Like a patient hunter.

It was then that my grandfather decided to come back and stay with us for a few days. He lived alone in a small neighboring town, and though he was old, he still carried a strong presence. When he arrived, we didn't make a big fuss. He greeted all of us and grew serious as soon as he stepped onto the porch. It seemed he already knew.

On the third day, he called me into the kitchen, when it was just the two of us. He poured a glass of water, sat at the table, and looked directly into my eyes. ""This thing that's been around here‚Ä¶ I've seen something like it before."" I didn't understand. I asked when. He replied, ""When I was a boy, long before you were born. It was summer then too. There was blood then too."" But he refused to tell the rest. He just said that, last time, the creature left after taking what it wanted.

It was that same week that something happened to the sheep. We had five sheep back then. One of them was my favorite. I called him Gus, and I always fed him right from my hand. He was calm, gentle, like a big dog.

\*\*\*

One morning, I woke to the sound of them bleating, a sound that was almost human-like. I ran to the pasture with my father and grandfather. We found three of the sheep dead. Their bodies were piled in the corner of the fence, all with the same marks on their necks. The other two were alive, but trembling, their eyes wide, as if they had witnessed hell.

My father cursed under his breath. My grandfather knelt beside the bodies and touched the earth. ""It's drying up the soul of this place,"" he said. ""This isn't just a hungry animal. This feeds on fear.""

That stuck in my head. How could something feed on fear? But at the same time‚Ä¶ it made sense. Because in that house, on that land, fear grew every day. It spread through the walls, through the hallways, through our bodies. We weren't sleeping well anymore. Every sound made our skin crawl. Even the sound of the wind began to feel like a threat.

I started avoiding being alone. I slept with the door locked, the light on, the window covered by an old blanket. But even so, I felt it. Every night, before falling asleep, I knew there was something out there. That it walked slowly near the house. That it stopped outside my window. And watched.

On the hottest night of the month, what I feared happened.

I woke up in the middle of the night to a soft noise. A continuous scratching on the glass, like a dry fingernail scraping against the window. I froze for a few seconds, praying I was dreaming. But the sound continued, light, rhythmic. Then I gathered my courage. I slowly turned my head. And I saw it.

On the other side of the glass, there was a hunched figure. It wasn't large, perhaps the size of a dog, but its shape was all wrong. It had legs that were too thin, arms that were too long, its skin looked gray and stretched. Its head was long, almost triangular, with short spines on the back of its neck. But it was the eyes that stopped me. Two opaque circles, glowing with a dull red, like dying embers.

It didn't blink. It didn't move. It just stayed there, pressing its forehead against the glass, watching me. I couldn't scream. Or move a muscle. I felt my whole body paralyze. It was as if the thing was inside my mind, wordlessly saying, ""I see you.""

We stayed like that for minutes. Or hours. I don't know. Until it simply receded into the darkness and vanished. I got up the next day with the sheet drenched in sweat and my eyes dry from trying so hard not to blink.

I didn't tell anyone that day. But since then, I never slept with the window uncovered again. And I never felt alone in that room again. Because after that night, I knew for sure: that creature knew who I was. And it would come back.

After that night, everything changed for me. I had seen it with my own eyes. That thing, that being that didn't seem to be part of this world, was there‚Ä¶ inches from my face, separated only by thin glass. And yet, no one else in the house knew about it. I spent days trying to find a way to tell, but the words caught in my throat. Part of me didn't want to believe. Another part‚Ä¶ feared that by speaking it aloud, I would make it even more real.

My behavior changed. I avoided going out at night, stayed away from windows, jumped at the slightest noise. My parents noticed. My mother asked what was going on. I just said I was having nightmares, that the heat was making me feel strange. She didn't push it. I think, deep down, she knew there was something more. But no one in that house wanted to face the truth. It was easier to pretend.

Even so, the truth found a way to surface.

The next night, my father woke up to a noise on the roof. He said it was like something walking, with light steps, almost as if testing its weight with each movement. He went up with his shotgun the next day, but found nothing but some marks in the dust‚Äîthin, curved grooves, like dragging claws. He came down without saying a word, but he sprinkled salt all around the house that afternoon. When Grandpa asked why, my father just replied, ""Precaution."" It was the first time I saw the two of them agree in silence.

The nights began to follow a pattern. The air seemed to grow denser after nine. The animals retreated earlier than normal. Even the insects seemed to vanish. And then, always around midnight, the sounds would come: subtle scratches, light thuds on the wooden wall, the snap of a branch even with no wind. And sometimes, that muffled hiss, like a low whisper coming from beneath the house.

One night, as I tried to sleep with a pillow covering my ears, I heard something different. It was as if someone was walking inside the house, but with irregular steps. I felt the floor vibrate slightly. My heart pounded. The doorknob moved. Just a little. But I saw it.

I lay there, paralyzed, my gaze fixed on the door, until the sun rose. At breakfast, my father had deep circles under his eyes. He said he hadn't slept because he heard something scratching inside the pantry.

\*\*\*

My mother trembled as she stirred her coffee, and Grandpa looked out the window as if expecting to see something in the cornfield.

That same day, my father decided to reinforce the house. He nailed extra boards on the windows, chained the sheds, scattered ashes and horseshoes in the corners. My grandfather stayed in the barn, armed, for most of the night. I tried to sleep early, but without success. The feeling of being watched had become constant. It wasn't just at night anymore. It was all day. Even under the scorching sun, I felt hidden eyes following me.

I slept little that night. And when I woke up, it wasn't by choice. It was because of a sound. A dry, repetitive sound. As if something was tapping with its knuckles on my bedroom windowpane. The window was still covered by the blanket, but the sound passed right through the wood. I didn't want to look. I swear I didn't. But something stronger than fear forced me to.

I got up slowly, my knees weak, and went to the window. I pressed my ear against the cloth. Silence. I pulled the blanket back with a yank. And there it was.

The creature.

This time, it was closer to the glass, as if trying to push its head through it. I could see every detail: the thin skin, pulled tight over its bones, as if its body was desiccated. Its dull eyes, rusty red. Its teeth, short and sharp, exposed in a grin that didn't seem made to communicate anything but hunger. It didn't move. It didn't breathe. It just watched. As if studying me. And then, slowly, it raised one of its hands. Three long fingers, with curved nails. And it pointed. Right at me.

It was the most human gesture I had ever seen that thing make. And it was the worst.

I ran from the window, closed the door, and hid under the bed, trembling, trying to control my sobs. I spent the rest of the night there, not daring to come out, even after the sound disappeared.

The next day, I told my grandfather. I expected him to laugh or say it was just my imagination. But he grew serious. He said the gesture had meaning. That the creature wasn't just observing anymore. It had chosen.

That kept pounding in my head. Chosen? For what? And why me?

After that, my name stopped being called for chores outside the house. My father said I should stay and help my mother. But I knew. They were afraid. Afraid to leave me alone outside. Afraid that thing would take me.

I tried to pretend everything was normal. But every time I passed a window, I felt that gaze following me. No matter the time. The field, the orchard, even the roof‚Ä¶ it seemed to be everywhere. And then, the dreams began. Dreams where I walked through the field alone, with the dark sky and the ground wet with blood. Dreams where the creature spoke to me with a voice not made of words. Only of sensations. Of empty promises. Of pain.

I started losing weight. Sleeping less. My eyes burned every day. My mother wanted to take me to the doctor. My father refused. He said it was just the heat and nerves. But deep down, we all knew. It was still out there. Watching. Waiting.

And worst of all: I felt that, somehow, it was getting closer. As if every time we ignored it, it came closer to the house. Closer to me.

On the last night of that month, before everything completely fell apart, I had the worst dream of all. In the dream, I was in the farm kitchen, alone. The fire was lit, but the light didn't illuminate anything beyond the table. I heard its breathing. I smelled earth and blood. And then, it whispered. Not with words, but with certainty.

""You are mine now.""

It was a moonless night, one of those where the sky seems to have been erased with black ink. The air was still, heavy, and not even the crickets dared to sing. Everyone in the house seemed more tense than usual. My grandfather had cleaned his shotgun three times in a row. My father didn't take his eyes off the door. My mother spent the day in silence, lighting candles in every corner of the kitchen.

No one said anything, but everyone knew something was coming that night.

I went to bed early, but sleep wouldn't come. My heart was restless, and my ears seemed to pick up sounds that didn't even exist. Around midnight, everything started. First, the horses. A desperate whinny, followed by banging against the fence. In seconds, the dogs began to bark like never before. A loud, frantic barking, which soon turned into whimpering. After that, came the scream.

It wasn't an animal. It wasn't human. It was a high-pitched, distorted sound, as if the world had been ripped open from within.

My father jumped up, grabbed his shotgun, and ran. My grandfather followed him, armed with a flashlight and an old revolver. My mother locked the door behind them and pushed me under the table. We stayed in silence. The house trembled with the sounds outside. Screams, footsteps, breaking wood. And that scream‚Ä¶ again, coming from a place that shouldn't exist.

The flashlight beam flickered outside, visible through the cracks in the window.

\*\*\*

We heard gunshots. First one. Then two. Then silence. My mother covered her mouth with her hand. I smelled kerosene and wet earth wafting through the door, even though it wasn't raining. Time seemed to stand still. I counted the seconds, waiting to hear something. Anything. Then, a knock on the door. Three taps. Slow, rhythmic.

My mother got up, her face white as paper. She grabbed a knife from the drawer and stood there, trembling. After a minute that felt like an hour, the doorknob turned. It was my father.

He entered with a cut face and a torn shirt. He didn't say a word. Behind him, my grandfather limped, leaning against the doorframe, his eyes lost and his mouth agape.

They closed the door, pushed the table against it, and sat on the floor, panting.

I asked what they had seen. My father didn't answer. Grandpa just said, ""It doesn't bleed. It doesn't feel. It doesn't want food. It wants presence.""

The next morning, my grandfather was dead. We woke up and found him sitting in the living room armchair, his eyes open and his face serene. As if he had simply stopped living, without pain, without a struggle.

My father cried for the first time that summer. It wasn't a loud, desperate cry. It was a short, dry sob. After that, he changed. He started walking around the house at night, mumbling to himself. He stopped eating properly. He spent hours standing on the porch, staring at the empty field as if waiting for someone to come back.

My mother tried to get him help, but he wouldn't let her. He said no one would believe them, that we couldn't abandon the place. That it was still there, watching, and that running away would only make it hungrier.

I didn't recognize my father anymore. That creature that showed itself at my window seemed to have taken more than the sheep and our sleep. It had taken the heart out of our family.

As the days passed, he distanced himself. From us, from the house, from himself. In one of the last times we spoke, he told me: ""It chose you. I tried to stop it. Now there's nothing left but to accept."" And he fell silent again, staring at the cornfield as if it were a mirror.

The thing had broken more than doors and fences that night. It broke something inside us. And, in the end, it didn't even need to invade. It just waited for us to fall apart.

A few days after my grandfather's death, my mother made a decision. She didn't consult my father. She didn't explain to me. She just packed what she could, threw the rest in the truck, and said it was time to go. ""This house isn't ours anymore,"" she murmured. ""There's something here that never wanted us around.""

My father didn't object. He just sat on the porch, shirtless, his feet dirty with earth, staring at the cornfield. His shotgun rested on his lap, but he no longer held it firmly. When my mother said she was leaving, he didn't respond. He didn't even move. It was as if he had accepted that the place had swallowed him whole, and that trying to escape would only make everything worse.

I looked back as we drove onto the dirt road. The farm looked smaller, like a miniature of everything that had gone wrong. The house, the barn, the fences‚Äîall quiet, still, as if they were relieved by our departure. But even from a distance, I still felt it. It was with me. Not in the walls, not in the furniture. In the air. In my body. As if something had clung to me.

We moved to a small town, the closest one with a hospital and a school. My mother found a simple job. She tried to smile. Tried to move on. But she had changed too. She prayed in silence every night. She had frequent nightmares. Sometimes, she'd wake me up, shaking me, saying she heard me whisper in my sleep, but I swore I couldn't remember anything.

As for my father‚Ä¶ he never truly left the farm. A few weeks later, my mother had to admit him to a facility. He walked the streets as if he were lost in his own time. He talked to the wall. Sometimes he smiled, other times he'd scream in the middle of the night, saying she was outside, waiting. When I visited him, he looked into my eyes and said, ""It still wants you. But now you know how to hide."" I was 14 years old. I didn't understand what that meant. I still don't fully understand.

Over time, we tried to erase the farm from our memories. But forgetting isn't the same as healing. I still dreamed of it. I dreamed of the house, of the dry field, of the red eyes in the dark. Sometimes, I'd wake up in the middle of the night with a tight chest, feeling like someone was standing outside my window. I never saw anything. But I also never had the courage to check.

My mother avoided any subject about that summer. She never spoke my grandfather's name again. She never mentioned the animals. Not even when I asked about my father did she answer directly. ""He's quiet now,"" she'd say. ""It's better that way.""

Years passed. I grew up with that hidden silence inside me, like a thin crack in glass that looks solid but is about to shatter.

\*\*\*

Sometimes, I thought I had overcome it. I left home, studied, built a life. But all it took was a night that was too dark, or the faint sound of nails on glass, for everything to come flooding back.

Because I know, deep down, that the creature never chased us. It never needed to. It just stayed. And I‚Ä¶ I left something of myself with it. Perhaps a name. Perhaps a scent. Perhaps just the fear.

But whatever it was, it's still there.

I'm here now. Again. Sitting on the porch of the old house. The same rotting wood, the same thick silence that never left. The barn is still standing, though crooked, covered in weeds and rust. The door creaks with the wind, as if it still remembers the screams of that night.

I came back because I needed to understand. Because, even after all these years, I've never been able to close that door in my mind. And part of me feels like I never fully left. As if something of mine was left here. And as if it never stopped watching me.

I have an old recorder with me. I'm trying to capture what I remember, what I feel, what I see. But the more I talk, the more I notice how heavy the air here remains. Dense. The same metallic smell as before is starting to emerge again. Subtle, but unmistakable. That smell that never came with rain, or with dead animals. It came with that thing.

The sun has already set. The house darkened in minutes. And now, as I speak, I hear the sounds. The old sounds. Light footsteps on the dry boards. A scratch on the side of the wall. The soft click of the window behind me. It's still here. Always has been.

They say time heals all wounds. That what haunts our childhood loses its power with the years. But that's not true. Some things don't age. They just wait. They wait patiently, like the creature that watched our field, night after night. They wait until you let your guard down. Until you come back.

I don't know if I'll leave here today. Maybe I came not to put an end to something, but to finish delivering what it never forgot. Because there's something in this land, something in that creature's eyes, that clearly said: ""You belong to me.""

We Should Not Have Listened,"The weekend it all began, I was completely disconnected. I'd decided to stay home, away from my phone, social media, everything. Just me, the couch, hot coffee, and the sound of soft rain against the window. Red Pine Falls was always like that on weekends: quiet, a bit forgotten, moving at its usual slow pace. I lived in an old apartment building, the kind that felt stuck in time. My neighbors were easygoing folks. The lady in 104 walked her dog every morning. The kid from B13 was always skateboarding in the parking lot. A couple down the street would fight loudly but always made up the next day.

It was Sunday when I saw the alert. I didn't hear a sound. I just noticed a shift in the living room light, like something had flickered. I looked at the TV, which was off, and it had turned on by itself. The screen displayed a red background with static white letters:

""EMERGENCY ALERT: DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOME. REMAIN DISCONNECTED. AVOID WINDOWS. AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.""

I grabbed my cell phone by reflex. It showed the exact same message. Same color, same font. No sound, no sirens, no explanation. Just that text.

My first reaction was to laugh. It seemed like a system error. Maybe a poorly programmed test. The government often runs simulations, right? Especially in small towns like ours. But when I tried to change the channel, the TV froze. The power button didn't work. My phone also froze. The screen flickered, then went back to the alert. I restarted it, but the same warning reappeared, as if it were imprinted on the system itself.

I looked out the window, expecting to see some movement, some collective response. But everything was the same. A few lights on in the surrounding buildings, but no one on the street. Not even the sound of the lady calling her dog, or the skateboarder, or the couple arguing. Just a thick silence, as if the world was holding its breath.

I went back to the couch, phone still in hand. I tried to open any app, but nothing worked. Everything was frozen. I turned on the old radio on the shelf. As soon as it powered up, the announcer's voice was interrupted, and the same alert phrase began to repeat, like a soft, emotionless mantra.

""Do not leave your home. Remain disconnected. Avoid windows.""

I switched it off immediately. From that moment on, everything in me wanted to say it was just a technical glitch, a coincidence‚Ä¶ but something was wrong. Very wrong.

The next morning, the first thing I noticed was the silence. Not a common silence ‚Äî it was something heavier, as if sound had been drained from the town. Even the birds weren't singing. I got up slowly, opened the window, and looked outside. The sky was cloudy, but no sign of rain. The streets were clean, the houses exactly as they always were, but no one in sight. No cars, no doors opening, no footsteps on the pavement. It seemed like everyone had simply vanished or decided, at the same time, to stay home. Even the lady from 104‚Äôs dog wasn't barking anymore.

The strangest thing was that the lights in most houses were still on, even in the morning. As if people were still inside ‚Äî just motionless. I watched for a few minutes, waiting for some movement. When I noticed a curtain moving in the apartment across the way, I felt a surge of relief. But the relief was short-lived. The curtain moved with exaggerated slowness, as if being pulled by someone who wasn't quite sure what they were doing. And then, through the glass, I saw a face. It was Mr. Larkin, from 202. He was just staring blankly at the sky, unblinking, expressionless. The curtain slowly dropped back down, and the window was closed.

I went back inside and tried to make a call. I called my sister, then my friend Mark, and then the city's main line. All the numbers rang, but none answered. Until one call connected. My sister's name appeared on the cell phone screen. I answered immediately. ""Hello?"" Silence. Then a voice emerged, but it wasn't hers. It was low, soft, strangely calm.

""Everything's fine now. Stay home. Await instructions.""

I hung up immediately. I don't know why it scared me so much. It wasn't a threat. It was the tone. Too calm, too controlled, as if someone had been trained to soothe me. But I wasn't calm. And something told me I shouldn't be.

Shortly after, I heard footsteps in the hallway. I went to the door and looked through the peephole. It was the teenager from B13, the skateboard kid. But he didn't have his skateboard with him. He just walked slowly down the hall, looking at each door. He reached mine, paused for a few seconds, and then whispered something too low for me to understand. Then he continued walking to the end of the hall and disappeared down the stairs. I opened the door slightly and called out to him, but he didn't respond. He didn't even turn his head.

That night was even stranger. The streetlights flickered, like a bulb about to burn out. In a moment of nervousness, I yelled out the window, asking if anyone knew what was happening. No answer. But, in the distance, I heard the sound of a door opening. And then another. Suddenly, all over the block, several doors slowly began to open. People emerged from their homes, but they didn't speak, they didn't interact. They just walked silently into the street, looking up, at nothing, as if they were waiting for something to fall from the sky.

There was Mr. Larkin, standing in the middle of the street, still with that empty expression. The lady from 104 was beside him, with her dog ‚Äî which was now lying motionless, eyes open. The teenager was there too. No one moved anymore. I stood there, watching, my heart pounding. And then, as if they'd received an invisible command, they all went back inside at the same time.

I closed the curtains, turned off the lights, and sat on the kitchen floor. Something was happening, and it wasn't just a simple alert. No one seemed scared ‚Äî and that's what bothered me the most. It was as if they had accepted a new rule, a new logic. And I was the only one who still hadn't figured out what it was.

I woke up the next day with a strange feeling in my body. It wasn't pain, or tiredness, but a kind of weight on my shoulders, as if the air was denser. The ceiling seemed lower. The silence was no longer strange; it was the new normal. I got out of bed with difficulty, drank some coffee that tasted like paper, and went to the door. When I tried to turn the doorknob, it wouldn't budge. I tried again, harder. Nothing. It was locked from the outside.

This made no sense. There was no lock on the outside of the door. At least, not that I knew of. I pushed, banged, forced. Nothing gave way. I went to the living room window and tried to open it, but I noticed the glass was different. It didn't reflect properly. It was as if a film had been glued to the outside. I grabbed a hammer from the cabinet and hit it hard. The glass cracked, then broke, and a cold wind rushed through the opening. But the air‚Ä¶ it had a strange smell. It wasn't pollution, or mold. It was sweet, almost perfumed, but artificial. A smell that made everything seem too clean, as if the world had been forcibly sanitized.

I looked out through the cracks and saw the mailman. He walked slowly, with regular steps, carrying nothing in his hands. He passed the mailboxes, but didn't put anything in any of them. He just walked to the end of the street and stopped. He stood there, looking at nothing. I kept watching until he turned and came back the same way, at the same pace. As he passed my window, he looked directly at me. Not with surprise, or shock. He just stared as if I were the strange one in this story.

I closed the window and went to the kitchen. I turned on the microwave to heat up some food, but the panel showed something strange: instead of numbers or functions, the same alert message appeared. The words were repeating:

""Remain at home. Await instructions. Everything's fine now.""

I turned the appliance off immediately. I looked around. The TV was off, but flickering, as if trying to turn on. My laptop no longer powered up. The radio played static, with small whispers I couldn't identify.

I went to the door again. The doorknob still locked. I began to wonder if someone had done that during the night. But who? And why? I grabbed a kitchen knife, not for protection, but because the idea of being trapped in my own home really started to weigh on me. Not because of the lack of freedom itself, but because of the absence of any explanation.

Later, I heard noises in the hallway. Slow footsteps. Someone whispering. I approached the door and listened intently. The voice repeated, almost like a child learning a new phrase: ""Everything's fine now. You're safe.""

I went to the peephole. It was the woman from 103. She was going from door to door, pressing her forehead against the wood and saying those words softly. Then she would smile and continue. Her face seemed too serene, as if she had achieved some forced peace. When she reached my door, she did the same ‚Äî said the words, pressed her head, and stayed there for a minute. Quiet. Until she left.

I stood motionless for a long time. When I finally managed to get off the floor, I noticed something even more unsettling. All the mirrors in the house ‚Äî in the bathroom, the living room, and even on the back of the closet door ‚Äî were fogged up. No windows had condensation. There was no steam. But the mirrors looked like they had been touched. And in the center of each, there was a mark‚Ä¶ as if someone had written a single phrase with their finger: ""Stay home.""

It was as if the message was trying to get inside me in every possible way. Through the screen. Through the sound. Through the smell. Now even through reflection.

I didn't sleep that night. The world outside seemed mute. And inside me, something was starting to stir. It wasn't exactly fear. It was doubt. As if a part of my mind was starting to think‚Ä¶ that maybe, just maybe, they were right. And that I really should just‚Ä¶ stay home.

I was starting to lose track of time. Hours no longer passed as before. The sky maintained that grayish hue, neither night nor day, as if the world had been put on standby. Food was running out. The refrigerator light flickered, as if even the electricity was afraid to stay on. I no longer received new alerts, but the original message kept flashing on all the devices that still worked. Even the ones that were off. It had become a kind of ghost.

On the fourth night, I heard knocking on the kitchen window. Three dry taps. Then, silence. I couldn't see anyone outside. Through the crack, I could only see the tall weeds of the community garden and the motionless outline of an abandoned car. But there was something about that knocking. It wasn't random. It was‚Ä¶ human. Measured. As if it was being used to get my attention, not to scare me.

The next morning, a sheet of paper was pushed under my door. It was a handwritten letter, with shaky letters. It said: ""If you still think for yourself, come down to the basement of Block C. Bring paper. No devices.""

It was signed only with a name: Clarke.

I thought of a thousand ways this could be a trap. But in the end, the idea of staying there, trapped and alone, was worse. I exited through the laundry room window, which was in the back and still had a simple latch. I walked through the back of the buildings, keeping my head down. The silence followed me, but it was an oppressive silence, full of invisible eyes. I saw some people through the windows ‚Äî empty faces, all looking inside their own homes. As if they had given up on the world.

I reached Block C, where the basement was partially open, with a rock propping the door. I went down the stairs cautiously, and there, in the dark, I found Clarke. A thin man, unshaven, wearing an old military coat and holding a flashlight. He didn't look dangerous. But he didn't look calm either.

He led me to a corner of the basement, where three others were sitting on the floor with pads of paper, writing. Clarke spoke softly, as if even the walls there could hear.

""You saw the alert, right?""

""Yes.""

""Then you're already compromised. But maybe there's still time.""

I asked what he meant by ""compromised."" And that's when he explained everything. The alert we received wasn't a warning message. It wasn't meant to protect us. It was the beginning. The entry. The vector.

""They designed the alert to seem safe. Cold, direct, clean. But it was designed to fix itself in the mind. Repetition, color, tone. It wasn't sent to inform. It was sent to condition.""

He showed me a portable radio that had been disassembled. The wires were black, as if burned.

""Every device that receives the signal is corroded. But not physically. The corrosion is mental. First you agree to stay home. Then you agree not to look out the window. Then you agree that you don't need to go out anymore. Until the thought of going out doesn't even exist.""

A woman in the group, with hollow eyes and trembling fingers, said her husband started repeating phrases a week before the alert. She said he had already ""received the call."" And that after that, he just smiled and said everything was better now.

Clarke showed me hand-drawn images, representing signal patterns ‚Äî spiral waves, truncated texts.

""These shapes repeat in the visual alerts. They get stuck in the brain like a virus. Most people accept it. Some, like us, resist. But for how long?""

I remained silent. My stomach churned. The alert, which until then I had treated as a strange warning, was part of the contamination. There were no sirens because the threat wasn't external. It was inside everyone's head. Planted there with a phrase and a color.

Before leaving, Clarke handed me a sheet of paper with notes. There was a hand-drawn map marking the center of town, where an old emergency transmission truck was located. According to him, that's where the signals were coming from.

""If you can shut that down, maybe there'll be time for the few who still resist.""

""What about you?"" I asked.

""I've seen the alert for too long.""

I returned home by the same route, avoiding the glazed eyes of those peeking through windows. Upon arrival, I closed all the curtains, turned off all remaining appliances, and sat on the floor, looking at the crumpled paper in my hands.

For the first time, I felt there was something bigger than just a system error. And that my mind had been molding for days ‚Äî perhaps from the very first moment I looked at that red screen. But now, I knew.

In the following days, I started to notice that something inside me was changing. It wasn't physical. My body was still the same; I still looked at myself in the mirror with that expression of accumulated tiredness. But my thoughts‚Ä¶ they began to repeat themselves. I noticed patterns in my own sentences. I would think something and, seconds later, repeat it in a low voice, as if trying to convince myself. Sometimes, I would write something in the notebook Clarke gave me, and when I reread it, it felt like it wasn't me who wrote it.

The words came too easily. ""Stay home. Everything's fine now. Avoid windows."" I didn't want to think about it, but the thoughts came on their own, like an echo. I started to distrust myself. My own mind. And that's the kind of fear you can't run from.

One night, I woke up with the sensation of being watched. The hallway light was on, even though I remembered turning it off. I went there and saw wet footprints on the floor. Small, like bare feet. They went from the front door to the bathroom. I followed slowly, my heart pounding. The bathroom was empty, but the mirror was fogged up ‚Äî and in the center, someone had written with their finger: ""You're almost ready.""

That night, I didn't go back to sleep. I sat on the bedroom floor with the flashlight on, the kitchen knife beside me, and the notebook open. I forced myself to write something different. I tried to remember my sister's name, the town where I was born, my favorite food. But the more I tried, the emptier everything seemed. The memories were there, but they crumbled in the details. Like dreams told too late. It was as if the parts that made me up were being deleted one by one.

The next day, I decided to go back to the basement, to look for Clarke. The door was ajar, as before, but no one was there. The place seemed abandoned for days, even though I knew I had been there a short time ago. On the floor, only a sheet of paper with a red spiral drawing. On the back, a phrase written in red pen: ""The more you look, the more it understands you.""

From then on, I began to question if Clarke had even existed. If that group of people was really there. Or if my mind, in an attempt to protect itself, created a fantasy of resistance to keep me functioning. But the map was still with me. The notes too. And the anguish wasn't a product of imagination. That, I knew.

On the way back, I saw a man standing in front of the building, looking at the sky. He was wearing a delivery uniform, completely dirty. His head was tilted back at a strange angle, as if his neck had locked up. The most disturbing thing was that he was smiling. Not aggressively. It was a serene, calm smile. Like someone who fully accepts what is about to happen. He slowly turned his head and looked at me. He didn't say anything. But the smile widened.

I ran up the stairs, locked the door with all the furniture I could drag, and locked myself in the bathroom. I was breathing too fast. My hands were shaking. My thoughts were jumbled. I looked in the mirror and tried to repeat my name out loud. I couldn't. My mouth opened, but no words came out. Just that feeling that the name no longer belonged to me. I was someone, but I didn't know who. And the part of me that knew‚Ä¶ was already gone.

In the following hours, I heard knocking on the door. It was rhythmic, soft, like the knocking on the window days earlier. And between each knock, a soft voice said: ""You're ready now. Let me in.""

The voice sounded like my sister's. Or maybe my mother's. Or maybe my own. I can't tell. But it was familiar. And that's what scared me the most.

I spent the rest of the night in absolute silence, trying not to think, not to hear, not to feel. But even with my eyes closed, I saw flickering images ‚Äî the red background, the white letters, the repeated message. And when I opened my eyes, I realized I had written on the floor with charcoal from the stove: ""Everything's better now.""

I didn't remember doing that. But the handwriting was mine. Or, at least, it was similar enough.

When dawn broke, the sky seemed even more wrong. The light had no defined color, as if the sun was trying to rise, but something was blocking the last part of the morning. Time didn't pass correctly. My wrist watch spun the numbers as if it were in test mode. My cell phone battery had finally died. Even the silence seemed denser.

I still had the map in my hands. The signal truck was marked with a circle in the center of Red Pine Falls, in front of the old radio station building. It was far, and the path was exposed. But if I didn't go, I already knew my fate: to become another smiling body staring at the sky.

I grabbed the notebook, a flashlight, a knife, and the remaining water bottle. I left through the back laundry room, the same way as before. The streets were empty, but not like an ordinary night. It was a programmed absence. As if someone had emptied the world so I would have no one to talk to.

Halfway there, I saw a child standing on the sidewalk, alone. She was looking at the pavement, hands behind her back, humming something without a melody. When I passed her, she stopped singing. She looked at me and said in a low voice: ""You're going there, aren't you? They know.""

And then she went back to singing. I stood paralyzed for a few seconds. I tried to ask who ""they"" were, but she just turned and went into the house next door, without rushing.

I kept walking, and the closer I got to the center of town, the more I felt like I was walking inside a glass corridor. The store windows displayed mannequins facing outwards, all with their faces covered by red cloths. This wasn't normal. This wasn't part of the decor. It had been placed there afterwards. By someone. Or by something that wanted to see me pass by.

Finally, I reached the spot indicated on the map. The old radio station was locked, but behind it, in the empty lot, was the truck. A military vehicle, gray, without license plates. The windows were dark and the engine was off. Even so, the chassis vibrated, as if some machine inside was still operating. On the side, an LED panel flashed with the same message:

""Remain at home. Await instructions.""

I approached slowly, my eyes fixed on the words. The feeling of being pulled was real. Not physically, but as if my mind wanted to get closer, understand, obey. When I put my hand on the doorknob, I heard a voice behind me.

""Don't touch that.""

I turned and saw a man, leaning against a wall, holding an iron bar. His face was dirty, his gaze tired. He was one of the locals I used to see at the market, but I couldn't remember his name. He approached.

""Can you still think?""

I nodded, unsure if it was true.

""Then we have a chance.""

His name was Martin. He had been hiding in the city center's service tunnels, trying to track the signal. He told me more people had tried to destroy that truck, but they couldn't even get close. Most gave up halfway. Others simply‚Ä¶ stopped.

With his help, we opened the back of the vehicle. Inside, it was worse than I imagined. There was no one, but there were screens. Many screens. And all of them displayed faces. Hundreds of faces, of the town's residents, repeating synchronized phrases. Some screens showed house rooms, others showed empty streets. It was as if the truck was watching the entire town, recording every word spoken, every window closed.

Martin started destroying the wires with the iron bar while I looked for the generator. The machine trembled, as if trying to resist. When I finally cut the power cables, the screens flickered and began to shut down one by one. The sound of the voices diminished to just a whisper, and then, silence. But it wasn't the end.

Martin stopped moving. He stood still in the middle of the truck bed, looking at the last screen still on. It was his face. But he was smiling.

He fell to the ground shortly after. No scream, no struggle. He just fell. I rushed to him, but he had no pulse. His face still showed that serene smile. For a second, I thought I was smiling too. I put my hand on my face. It was normal. But the thought‚Ä¶ the thought lingered.

I got out of there as fast as I could, running through increasingly distorted streets. The houses seemed tilted. The trees seemed to be watching me. And the feeling of being followed never left me. When I finally reached the edge of the town, I no longer knew if I had managed to escape the signal‚Ä¶ or if I was just carrying it with me.

I stayed out of town for a while. Hidden in an abandoned shed on the outskirts of Red Pine Falls, eating the little I had saved and drinking rainwater. I thought maybe I had won, that the destroyed truck meant the end of the signal. But every night I heard something. Not outside the shed. Inside me. Low voices, repeating the same thing. Not like a thought. It was deeper than that. As if my mind had been re-recorded by a program that was still running in the background.

During the third day in that shelter, I noticed a red light flashing in the sky. It was a drone. Not a military one. Small, commercial. It came from the north, circled my position, and then left. The next day, another appeared. It wasn't a coincidence. They were still monitoring. They were still searching.

That's when I understood: the truck wasn't the source. It was just one of the transmitters. Like one tower among many. The central hub was still active. And the hub was what fed the voices. I went back.

I knew it was a stupid decision. But I needed to know where it was coming from. I walked back through the forest to the west side of town. What I saw paralyzed me. Red Pine Falls wasn't abandoned. On the contrary ‚Äî it seemed‚Ä¶ in order. The lights in the houses were all on. The curtains perfectly aligned. Some children were playing on the sidewalk. But the way they moved was too artificial. As if every gesture had been rehearsed. As if every resident was living a perfect simulation of their old life. And everyone was smiling.

I found what I was looking for in the old part of town, near the disused train tracks. An emergency operations center had been set up in an old school. Inside, through a broken window, I saw cables, panels, antennas. And a room full of people. They were sitting in chairs, side by side, with headphones and monitors on. Their eyes were open, but unblinking. Some mumbled nonsense words. Others just took a deep breath and repeated: ""You're safe now.""

There were no supervisors. No security. Just them, functioning like pieces of a living machine. I walked among them. None reacted. And in the center of the room, a single screen displayed an aerial view of Red Pine Falls. And at the bottom of the screen, a phrase silently rotated: ""Stable connection. Active transmission.""

I didn't know what to do. Unplug cables? Destroy equipment? Part of me just wanted to run. But another part‚Ä¶ wanted to sit there too. Put on the headphones. Be silent. Stop feeling. Stop being. But I forced myself to leave.

On the way back, I saw my own face reflected in a storefront. I was sweaty, pale, but something was wrong. My eyes‚Ä¶ weren't blinking. And there was a slight smile at the corner of my mouth. The same smile I saw on the mailman. On the delivery guy. On the child. Maybe I had already passed the point of no return.

I fled the town that same night. Not by road, nor by the known trails. I cut through the dense woods, following only instinct and what was left of my free will. I walked for hours until the sound disappeared. Not the sound of the town ‚Äî the sound inside my head.

I found shelter in an abandoned cabin in the mountains. Since then, I avoid any electronic devices. I use candles, write by hand, eat what I can hunt or grow. I don't connect with anyone. Sometimes I see smoke on the horizon. Sometimes I hear voices that sound human, but I'm not sure. I never go to them.

Six months have passed. The signal is gone, but not the thoughts. I still dream of the phrase. I still wake up with the feeling that I'm smiling, even when I'm not. Sometimes I forget my name for a few minutes. Sometimes I catch myself repeating phrases I didn't write.

The world didn't end. But it changed. Red Pine Falls was just a test site. An experiment. Perhaps other places have already been ""corrected."" Perhaps this is the new way to control people ‚Äî not with force, but with quiet obedience. A screen. A soft voice. An order that sounds like care.

If you saw the alert, even for a second‚Ä¶ it might already be too late.",14,1752621354.0,nosleep,2,0.94,False

He uses Reddit regularly so I‚Äôm going try to be vague a bit. He makes a live-able amount of money- not a TON but not so little that he‚Äôs struggling all the time. We live together and have for a year. We don‚Äôt share a bank account, though we split rent and bills.

I am thinking about the future and want to start saving for a house, pay off debt, have an emergency fund etc. possibly having children. 
And all the while he spends nearly all of his extra money on collectibles. (Extra as in- outside of immediate bills) I have never met someone who shops online as much as he does. There‚Äôs always something coming in the mail and it makes me so upset.  (Something coming in the mail- as in something that he doesn‚Äôt need but buys because he wants to) 
I think he knows it bothers me because he‚Äôs recently started hiding the packaging and boxes and runs to our room when he gets home to put something away immediately.
I don‚Äôt do this type of spending. It‚Äôs more important to me to have food in the fridge and make sure our bills are paid and every once in a while see a baseball game or get a coffee with a friend. 
I want to be the type of person who accepts him for who he is and not judge what someone else spends their money on. But I feel such a deep misalignment in values on this. 
I was cleaning today and found a bank statement with a credit card balance of over 4000 in his name. That I did not know about.

Every time I‚Äôve brought up saving, or maybe cancelling some subscriptions or changing spending habits to prepare for the future the conversation falls flat and ends up being ‚Äúif I made more money I could save‚Äù and I‚Äôm thinking - you could save right now if you stop spending your money on things you don‚Äôt need. 

I want to start a family some time in the next 5 years and not live paycheck go paycheck like my parents did. I don‚Äôt want to marry someone who doesn‚Äôt handle their finances well.

I really do love him as a person. He‚Äôs so kind and supportive and loving. But I also think he‚Äôs so immature and avoidant of problems.

1m0wq6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1m0wq6n/bed_sheet_clips_stop_sheets_from_slipping/,Bed Sheet Clips: Stop Sheets From Slipping!,"**Title:** Bed Sheet Clips: My Search for Sheet Fasteners That ACTUALLY Work!

Okay, Reddit, I gotta share something that‚Äôs been a low-key source of daily frustration for YEARS: fitted sheets that refuse to stay put. üò† I swear, every single morning I'd wake up with the corners popped off, the sheet bunched up, and my bed looking like a disaster zone. I tried everything ‚Äì deeper pocket sheets (nope), those elastic straps that crisscross under the mattress (total fail), even considered safety pins (but the thought of accidentally stabbing myself in the middle of the night? Hard pass).

I'm a bit of a neat freak, and I really value Cleanliness and organization! Having a messy bed just stressed me out and I didn‚Äôt like having to readjust the sheets. And it's not like I have a crazy active sleep style, it was driving me nuts! I‚Äôm a middle to upper-middle class woman between 25 and 65. I am also a homeowner who takes pride in her living space.

Then, a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon these ""Non-Slip Bed Sheet Clips: Strong Grip, Lasts Long!"" I was skeptical, I'll admit. I‚Äôve been burned before. But the reviews seemed promising, with most people saying they kept their sheets in place and were super easy to install, so I figured, what the heck, it's worth a shot? I'm always looking for ways to save time and add some convenience to my life!

And honestly? They're amazing. Seriously. It‚Äôs been weeks, and I haven't had to readjust my sheets *once*. Not once! I even tested them out on my guest room bed, which has a thinner mattress and is notorious for sheet slippage, and they worked like a charm there, too. These sheet fasteners are a godsend.

The clips themselves are super easy to use. They just clamp onto the corners of your sheets and then clip underneath the mattress. They feel really sturdy ‚Äì not flimsy like some of the other sheet holders I've tried in the past. The strong grip is no joke. I toss and turn a bit, and the sheets stay PUT.

I‚Äôve also been reading up and the universal fit accommodates any mattress size and sheet types. Talk about simplifying your life.

It‚Äôs such a small thing, but it‚Äôs made a HUGE difference in my mornings. No more wrestling with sheets before my coffee, no more starting the day feeling frazzled. It has really decreased the stress and frustration associated with starting your day out in a tidy bedroom. I even feel like my bedroom looks neater and more put together now that the bed is always nicely made. üõå

I get my household supplies from a variety of online retailers and some brick and mortar stores. I was looking at ursupermart.com the other day and found some interesting organizational items.

I think I got the best price on these sheet clips there!

I really like that the product description states that the durable construction will lead to customer satisfaction and prevent having to replace cheap clips frequently.

If you're tired of battling unruly sheets, I highly recommend giving these Non-Slip Bed Sheet Clips a try. It takes just a few minutes to install and then completely eliminates the daily problem of sliding sheets. They‚Äôre a total time-saver and sanity-saver. I consider it a small win. üèÜ

Want to try these sheet fasteners yourself? Here is where I got them: https://go.ursupermart.com/HGIcTH

Seriously, if you are looking for bed sheet clips that work, look no further. I‚Äôm telling you, this one little purchase has made my life significantly less annoying. üòÑ You can thank me later!

**Cozy Sweater: Pale skin musk, faded perfume, Egyptian amber, softly burning nag champa incense and a fine aged vanilla. Our best selling scent of all time.**

1m0wnou,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1m0wnou/why_do_millennials_constantly_coin_phenomenons_to/,Why do millennials constantly coin ‚Äúphenomenons‚Äù to shit on GenZ?,"The GenZ vs millennial discourse has been going on for YEARS now. Like no joke I was 13 having back in fourths with millennials in TikTok comment sections just getting grilled about how awful I am for being born in a different timeline then them, or that I had an awful childhood because I didn‚Äôt use map-quest or VHS, and being called a tide pod muncher despite being like 11 when that fad happened. This is mainly just an online thing, millennials I know irl are generally sweet caring people who have often taken me under their wing more often then not. But online? God they HATE us with a passion.

Every few months I see a new ‚Äúphenomenon‚Äù regarding GenZ, almost always coined by millennial women in their 30s. It would be dumb for me not to acknowledge that Gen Z has done this too with the ‚Äúmillennial burger restaurant‚Äù phenomenon and the ‚Äúmillennial English teacher‚Äù and ‚Äúmillennial tattoos‚Äù, their usually always set to that one Kyle Gordan song and I like to think that it‚Äôs generally light hearted and nobody is telling people that serving drinks at your restaurant in mason jars and using a bitmoji for all your class slideshows and having bold line tree and butterfly tattoos are a bad thing horrible thing, but it is something we associate with that age demographic. Maybe it is offensive I‚Äôm not the one to decide that. But the GenZ phenomenons feel just a lot more‚Ä¶. Mean spirited?

Like how a few months ago everyone began saying how GenZ was ‚Äúaging like milk‚Äù and thousands of 30 something year old MOTHERS flocked to TikTok to tell TEENAGERS that they were aging awful and at 17 they looked 32 and how THEY looked so much better, and SO much younger and 3 people in the past 7 months thought they looked younger then their age so that means they don‚Äôt JUST look teenagers, they look leagues better THEN teenagers. And just thousands of other women just cheering them on and feeding into the delusion. Now call me woke or a snowflake, but it‚Äôs a little strange that we just let a bunch of grown adults bully literal teenagers for their looks to make themselves feel better about getting older‚Ä¶ and instead of pointing out the seemingly obvious weirdness of grown women telling teenagers who look like teenagers that they‚Äôre ugly and haggered and that their better then them, it became a widely accepted fact that yep! Genz just is ageing bad and millennials look absolutely fantastic and that is always how it will be. 

And then came articles, literal journalists taking the time out of their day to write articles about how awful Millie bobby brown and Kylie Jenner and other GenZ celebrities (notice how it‚Äôs mainly girls and women being called old too?), because it‚Äôs apparently just UNHEARD of for a woman to have smile lines at 24 or 27? I was so proud of Millie for calling these journalists for what they are, bullies who thrive on tearing successful women down. I know people people in person who were directly affected by this ‚Äúphenomenon‚Äù, people (teenagers) who were told they looked old by a 30 something year old ADULT online and became very self conscious about looking old. 

Now newest phenomenon is ‚Äúthe GenZ stare‚Äù where apparently GenZ service workers don‚Äôt say hi, aren‚Äôt personable, and just stare at you like a freak. Spoiler alert, this is not a GenZ thing, this is the ‚Äústare‚Äù of tired, burnt out service workers, struggling to make ends meet while casually being abused by strangers daily for just trying to do their job and being treated as lazy slackers who contribute nothing to society despite being the little people who keep it going everyday. The same stare millions have given at their jobs for decades, but because GenZ take a big number of the blue collar workforce now, it is now a GenZ problem and we are just so rude and mean and freaky for not being in a super happy mood all 12 hours of their minimum wage shift. When GenZ (and other service workers in general) rightfully expressed how difficult and mentally draining it is to deal with unforgiving customers who demand so much for so little and are quick to abuse workers, came the videos of millennials going ‚ÄúGenZ blaming their shitty additudes and creepy stares on bad customer experiences is SoOoOo typical, I go into Starbucks ALL THE TIME and GenZ workers just STARE at me and don‚Äôt even say hi or welcome in‚Äù. I‚Äôll tell you right now as someone who works in customer service and has for many years now, every person coining this ‚Äúphenomenon‚Äù are the same ones treating service workers like dirt, screaming, complaining, staring daggers at workers assisting them or making their food looking for anything their doing wrong, calling workers idiots for not making their damn iced coffee absolutely perfect to their liking. While a lot of people from ALL generations have been defending GenZ on this one I‚Äôm kind of shocked how many millennials are hopping on this trend, even Melissa Kristen, a millennial nostalgia creator who typically defends GenZ against these weird tear down trends, made a video agreeing with it. 

Its really tiring do have older people CONSTANTLY play armchair psychologist and create new phenomenons directed at my generation for doing things like being tired at work or aging, I really miss when it was just ‚Äúhow dare your age group have your own trends that don‚Äôt align with my age groups‚Äù and ‚Äúthe nerve of kids these days to part their hair down the middle and not the side‚Äù. Now its ‚ÄúGenZ are ugly old looking unstable freaks who can‚Äôt even say hi‚Äù and at this point I‚Äôm wondering if we can do anything right, because basically at this point just our human nature can and will be turned into a huge talking point can only ever be associated with GenZ and TikTokers and journalists will waste their time pumping out articles and videos about the ‚Äúissue‚Äù. With our millennial talking points it‚Äôs ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt you noticed that all millennials have an awkward pause at the start of their videos‚Äù and ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt you noticed millennial owned restaurants always have this layout and designs and serving styles?‚Äù And Millennials talking points about GenZ are ‚Äúaren‚Äôt all GenZ ageing fucking horrible? Like we ALL look better than them right?‚Äù And ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt you noticed that all GenZ are fucking depressed miserable freaks who just stare at you while you‚Äôre ordering starbies??‚Äù

I can‚Äôt eat at restaurants. I can have black coffee and water when I go out but that is it. Obviously dating involves a ton of food as do most social events. When I go out and about I either eat ahead of time or pack foods I can have. And I‚Äôve found many men find it very off putting and a deal breaker. Or they want to cook for me and while I find that endearing my diet is such I only trust myself to prepare my meals because if something were to go wrong I am at risk of death or serious illness. 

I have hobbies that don‚Äôt involve food to cope but dating is a whole thing and I understand why someone may find it weird. How do I approach it? I try to not hide it and disclose right away but that has obviously not prevented people from being weirded out and not continuing to see me due to it. I am always clear I am not offended if someone eats in front of me as well but I guess people feel awkward about it. I get a lot of pity which I don‚Äôt want or people try to accommodate me but they cannot. I simply want to be treated as normal. Unfortunately people see my medical condition as me.

(USA),"I swear, the second the snackwraps dropped, people decided to empty their children's college funds and take out new credit cards so they can drop $60 a day. I'm not kidding. We are getting $50-$90 orders daily. So of course, people are getting parked. But then they will call up the store, claiming that they have been waiting for 20 minutes (3 minutes) and they were getting sick of waiting. Because surely we can make 4 double QPC, 40 nuggets, 3 kids meals and 4 snackwraps on the fly. 


But TODAY, today, I was so glad maintenance took their food. It was after 12 and someone curbsided 2 large coffees. Oh and did I mention it was storming? Anyway, since it was the afternoon, all the coffee had been dumped so I had to brew a fresh pot. They waited 2 minutes and immediately called to the store, demanding their coffee and wondering why it was taking so long. Because for some reason, they think we have fresh coffee 24/7? Anyway, we sent the maintenance guy to deliver them and apparently, they were extremely rude to him. Like if you are that desperate for hot coffee instantly, go to a coffee shop or MAKE IT AT HOME!

*I‚Äôm back. Between work and reading through Simon‚Äôs coffee stains, it took me a while to transcribe this one. I‚Äôve been trying to wrap my head around what Simon had been writing about. Right now, none of this is making any real sense to me.*¬†



*I initially started writing these posts because I love my brother, or to be honest: I love the idea of a brother. Simon was out of the picture for most of my life, when people ask me if I have siblings, it‚Äôs just easier to say, ‚Äúnope, only child.‚Äù I felt like I was missing out, that I didn‚Äôt have something that so many others I knew growing up did. While I never really knew him, I mourned that we never had a connection.*¬†



*With that being said, I‚Äôm starting to get really frustrated with his decisions. If everything he‚Äôs saying is true, then he should have left by then. From what I remember of what I heard about Simon, he was a little of a loner. I have the faintest memory of him bringing some girl over to the house, but that‚Äôs it. Why was he doing this all alone? Why did he think it was his sole responsibility?*



September 5th, 1995

I was walking down a set of rickety stairs, the kind that would slip jagged splinters into the soft flesh of your feet should you walk down them barefoot. The walls were damp stone, moss and other lichens were slowly propagating in the cool air. As I descended, I heard murmuring. It was the soft spoken voices of women, harmonizing in an interwoven melody. I could swear one of the voices is Maia‚Äôs, she had a very lovely, if seldom used, singing voice. Regardless, I didn‚Äôt understand what language the women were speaking, but it didn‚Äôt matter. It was beautiful, I knew then why the woods were so silent: It was so the trees and the wind could hear the song too.¬†



My feet were ragged from the biting wooden steps, it was a relief when stepping down from the last one, my feet sank in brown muck. I looked around in the dark cellar I found myself in. The cellar was entirely unremarkable, except for the singing, and for the well in the center of it.¬†



The well was made of gray stones, it had a hand crank and a bucket. A wooden roof was constructed over it, as if the well was meant to be outside. An ethereal green glow emanated from within it, from the water harbored down below. I moved forward, but each step became harder and harder. There was a disconnect between my heart and my body, each nerve in my muscles setting like concrete to keep me from the well, from the glow within it. I persisted, pushing against the soupy air and my leadening body. I reached laboriously, fingers twitching from the effort, and with a gasp placed my hands on the rim of the well. I took a moment to bathe myself in the music. It was like mom singing when I was sick as a child. I heard bubbling, air rising to the surface of the water in chokes and sobs. From beneath the surface of the water, a bloated and peeling face, mouth full of broken and jagged teeth, eyes watery and deflated in cracked sockets, surged out of the water screeching.¬†¬†¬†



I sat up in a cold sweat, looking around the living room frantically from my spot on the couch. For a moment my brain was disconnected with reality, was the drip I felt down my spine just sweat? Or was it water from the well? My senses eventually came to me, and I found myself once again alone in George‚Äôs house.¬†



After my dream last night, I took it slow. I lazily drank the instant coffee I heated up on my camping stove and rocked in the chair on the sagging front porch. The air was cool and clear, I took several deep breaths through my nose and basked in the crispness. All of this however could not take my attention away from the eerie silence of the woods, a monkey paw‚Äôs wish I had to get a break from the noise I originally sought to flee.¬†



While nice, the peaceful morning did little to soothe the residue of the night off of me. Did nothing to help me forget the face in the well: the way the mouth curled into a hungry snarl, the fact that the face bore resemblance to my mothers, how the face that meant to take a bite out of me was Uncle George‚Äôs.¬†



Collecting myself, I returned back into the living room and got dressed. Pulling out a fresh pair of gloves and an unused garbage bag, I sought to finish out the kitchen today. The work was foul, the stages of rot and decay ran the whole spectrum, and multiple times I had to stop and gag. But I was refreshed by sleep and oatmeal, so I made quick work of the remaining mess. I made a point to sweep up the rest of the cobwebs, which mercifully looked only like cobwebs. As I swept up the rest of the clutter on the dining room table, I uncovered another message.¬†



*Lie, and it‚Äôll take your teeth*¬†



I felt a chill roll over my spine like an electric current, but this time I did not panic. In a strange way I was becoming used to the eerie details of George‚Äôs mind, the way he imprinted his thoughts into the environment that he was in. I didn‚Äôt know what the *it* was in reference to, and I didn‚Äôt know if I should even bother wondering. In a place like this, anyone could go insane, so I was starting to consider if I should even pay any of the stranger details any attention. He was sick in the last moments of his life, that was all.



Dumping the last of the kitchen‚Äôs mess into the backyard burn pile, I spritzed it with a healthy dose of Kerosene and lit the whole thing up. I took a few steps back as wet, burning garbage fumes polluted the air around the flames. The air became rancid, and as the coffee worked its way through me I decided that it was a good time to relieve myself out in the tree line, where I could keep an eye on the flames.¬†



The forest floor was uneven, veiny like the back of an old man‚Äôs hand. My boots swished through dead leaves, leaves that were on the last leg of their journey to becoming mulch, and it was because of this I didn‚Äôt see the lip of a root. The toe of my sneaker caught on it, causing me to stumble a few steps, doing that awkward forward dance to keep myself falling on my face. The idea of injury, the possibility of twisting my ankle or worse, flashed through my mind. It was just me out here, if I hurt myself there was no one else to come and lick my wounds. Sure it would be nice to not be chided on my carelessness, but that did not overshadow the desire to be taken care of, for someone to cradle my injury and ice it for me. I felt my heart pang, for my mom, or for Maia. Like the birds, I did not sing out for companionship.¬†



I found a tree to lean on, and did my business as I watched the fire crackle on. It was when I was starting to fasten my belt that I noticed something fuzzy against rough bark and browning leaves. I saw it out of the corner of my eye, turning to see a gray rabbit staring at me. It was standing perpendicular from me but with its eye trained directly on me. As it was several dozen yards away from me, its unblinking eye looked jet black. Neither nose nor ear twitched on the beast, it stood as if it was transfixed in time.



It stared at me, through me, into me. It was the first animal I had seen out in the woods, and a horrible thought pushed into my brain, telling me the rabbit would be the last animal I saw as well. I threaded my belt back into place, and when I looked up, the rabbit was bolting towards me. I took a step back in shock and caught my heel on a root, falling back and slamming my head against the ground. My head filled with a thick, clear soup as I looked up at the sprinting rabbit, its open jaw revealing jagged orange teeth, and a silent scream. Rolling onto my stomach I stumbled to my feet and ran sluggishly to George‚Äôs house, my thoughts dazed but still desperate to keep those fangs out of my flesh. I sprinted back into the yard, barreling past the rotten garbage inferno towards the house. I heard the thuds of the rabbit‚Äôs feet against the ground behind me, so close to me. But they sounded heavier, louder. It was as if it wasn‚Äôt a rabbit chasing me back towards the house, but rather a man.¬†



I barreled into the house, frantically spinning and slamming the door shut. Fingers trembling with adrenaline, I fumbled with the lock, sliding the long metal bar into the slot in the wall. My head was pounding, I felt rippling pain all through my skull and down into my neck. I peeked through the window, looking for the rabbit. I scanned the yard, looked by the fire and by the tree line. Yet no matter how hard I looked or where, the rabbit was nowhere to be seen.¬†¬†



I stood at the door, the cool glass of the window easing my headache, and I laughed to myself, smearing fog into the window with my breath. At myself would be closer to the truth, I was wound tight. A rabbit running in the woods was enough to scare me, to terrify me. Even though I hadn‚Äôt seen any other animals, it of course did mean there weren‚Äôt any. Maybe George was just a very adept hunter, and didn‚Äôt discriminate in what he shot.¬†



I heard a knock at the front door.¬†



It was swift and clear, ringing through the house with a clear note. I turned back and looked into the living room, unsure who could be at the door. A part of me was excited to talk to another person, another part didn‚Äôt know who could realistically be here. I walked slowly into the living room, past the table with all the scarred warnings. I caught sight of bright colors through the windows, neon pinks and greens shifting behind the sheer curtains. Pulling back the curtain slightly, I took a look at who was on my porch. She was around her 50s, her skin weathered and tanned like an athlete. She had black biker shorts on, and a green top. She had pink sweatbands on her wrists and forehead, as she was currently stretching on the front porch. Slowly I opened the door.¬†



Robin: Hi! Is George home?¬†



Me: Um, no. No I‚Äôm sorry, he‚Äôs not at home. To whom am I speaking?¬†



Robin: No? Bastard, I told him I‚Äôd be here. I‚Äôm Robin, I visit George during my runs. I‚Äôm training for a marathon, have you ever run a marathon?¬†



Me: Um, no.¬†



Robin: You should! It hurts so good, it‚Äôs true what they say about a runner‚Äôs high. When will George be home?¬†



Me: I-I‚Äôm sorry, George passed away recently.¬†



Robin: Oh! Oh I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that, gracious that‚Äôs horrible. He was such a sweet old man, so gentle. Is this your home now, dearie?¬†



Me: My mom‚Äôs actually, she was George‚Äôs sister. I‚Äôm his nephew, I‚Äôm cleaning it out. My name is Simon.¬†



As the words left my lips, I felt my body shudder. It was the sensation of being drained, like an IV had been plugged into me, and I started to seep out of myself. I felt as if I had said something I shouldn‚Äôt have, and Robin knew it. She brushed her blonde curls out of her face, and seemed to really look at me then.¬†



Robin: Simon, what a lovely name. You and your mother must be very heartbroken by your loss, how are you two holding up?  
  


Me: We‚Äôre doing good, sad of course but we‚Äôre keeping busy.¬†



Robin: That‚Äôs good, that‚Äôs smart. Is your mother with you here?¬†



Me: She is, she‚Äôs upstairs resting.¬†



In the moment, it felt right to lie. I didn‚Äôt know her, and I didn‚Äôt relish the idea of her knowing I was alone. Despite this, another shudder, and Robin‚Äôs smile widened.¬†



Robin: I can only imagine, the loss of a sibling is so taxing. I‚Äôll tell you, running as far as I have has been taxing itself, haha! Might I pop in and have a glass of water? George‚Äôs water always tastes so sweet when I‚Äôm out and about.¬†



Courtesy almost got the best of me. As odd as she was, it was nice to speak to someone, to hear someone else‚Äôs words. My lips began to move, to offer some kindness to Robin, when an image of the table flashed through my mind.¬†



*Don‚Äôt let it in*¬†



Me: I- The house is fairly messy, I‚Äôm in the process of cleaning it up. How about I bring a glass out to you?¬†



Robin: That sounds lovely, dearie.¬†



Did I detect a sneer in her face as I closed the door? I felt my head throbbing still from the fall. She said that she knew George, so surely she would know the house was filled to the brim with garbage. I found a glass that looked relatively clean and wiped the dust from it. I walked over to the sink, still full with plates and plastic Tupperware, and turned on the faucet. The piping rattled and clinked, and after a few spurts of bubbly white water, clear cold water ran smoothly out of it.



I filled the glass and returned to the door, where Robin was continuing her dynamic stretching.¬†



Me: You said you knew George?¬†



Robin: Oh yes! Very sweet, very laid back. Ask him almost anything about the forest, and he‚Äôd tell such a lovely tale about it.¬†



Me: Yeah, mom told me he was in the woods a lot as a kid, found them exciting I think.¬†



Robin: Oh I do too, there‚Äôs so many little doors all around here, if you know where to look for them.¬†



A chill rose up my spine as she brought the glass to her lips, what did she mean by that? Robin rose and drank the water greedily, each gulp causing her throat to pulsate as she chugged it down. Something about the sight made me feel queasy. When she was done, she handed me back the glass and smiled.¬†



Robin: Thank you, do you know what makes that water so special?¬†



Me: It‚Äôs water you have after a run?



Robin: Hahaha, a joker! I like jokers. No dearie, it‚Äôs well water.¬†



She smiled again, and something about it seemed too wide this time.¬†



Robin: Such lovely water in this part of the world, it would be a mistake to not use it, right Simon?



Me: I- yeah.¬†



Robin: Oh yes. Oh! Did you know that George was a photographer? Loved film and all the science behind it.¬†



Me: Uh, yes. Yeah I was cleaning his darkroom just the other day, it seemed like he was serious about it.¬†



Robin: Oh he was. He took some photos of me recently, I was really looking forward to showing my grandkids when they got into town. Do you know where they are?¬†



Me: I would have to look-¬†¬†



Robin: I think that would be lovely if you could. I best get a move on, still have thirteen more miles to go! I‚Äôll stop by again to see about those photos, I‚Äôll be seeing you, Simon.¬†



Robin turned and began jogging down the driveway, and I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how loud her footfall was. As I closed the door, trying to go over that interaction in my head, my breath caught as I remembered the second warning on the table:¬†



*Lie, and it‚Äôll take your teeth*
