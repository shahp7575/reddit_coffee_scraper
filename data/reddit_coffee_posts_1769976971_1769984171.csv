I'll play games after a long day at work, try to hit up a nice hike or venture somewhere new on those days I have free, but I also do love a good lazy day in where the effort is the weekly cleanings and then enjoying each other's company watching a show or doing our own things together.

1qtcbsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qtcbsj/please_dont_play_with_mens_feelings_please/,"Please don’t play with men’s feelings, please","My whole life I’ve had one girlfriend, lasted a total of 1 month because I was scared of moving forward, this was in my early teens.  Turning 18, I realised maybe it’s time for me to put myself out there, try to find someone I enjoy being with.  I’ve struggled with body dysmorphia for years, mental struggles too, so I really thought this would help.  I joined dating apps and had nothing, or not much at all, until someone did match with me, and I started talking to her, really talking to her.  I enjoyed it.

Fast forward a little while, my gym progress started to go downhill, my mental health started declining again too.  Having nothing to lose (or so I thought) me and my friend are drafting messages to ask her out with (I was terrified of the concept), and so one night I did, I sent it.  We were to meet on Sunday (it was the Friday night I asked her) just for a coffee date.  

Fast forward again, and I make the biggest mistake, I put everything on that day and hoping she’d be nice and show up.  I was ready to buy her a flower, had my best outfit on, stressed out about what to do and finally got on the bus to meet her, to then see her message that second saying she’s not coming, literally just before we were supposed to meet, because a lot happened that morning apparently. 

Keep in mind, I’ve not cried since I was 12, and im 18 now, I broke down on that bus, completely and utterly.  Everything that happened that week and previous crashed onto me and I couldn’t bear it.  I made it into town on the bus after almost puking from over-stimulation and sat and tried to make myself feel better with a hot chocolate.  

She hasn’t messaged since or even tried to reach out even though I have, I think she even unfollowed me or deleted me.  Later that day I seen her out with someone else, and it broke me even more.  So please tell someone the truth of why you don’t want to meet with them, and don’t think it’s just acceptable to ghost someone when you just cancelled on them",2,1769983485.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

1. Have a workspace. It doesn’t need to be fancy, it can be simple asf. Have a place where you can sit down and just work without distractions - have your book out on the right page, don’t have a separate desktop for just studying, etc.
2. Low on energy? Drink a coffee, nap for 20 mins, and now the caffeine has kicked in and you can do some deep work
3. Multitasking is a myth - one screen, just do a single task at hand for as long as it takes - that’s productivity
4. Leverage AI - practice questions, chatgpt can literally help you understand anything (given you’re not studying PHD-level maths)
5. Study with friends - motivation + you can test each other!
6. Exercise daily - genuinely helps with long study days
7. Make cheatsheets (super condensed), so you can read them before an exa

Since I enjoy world history and board games, it's not hard for social media to target me with ads that combine those. 

https://preview.redd.it/7p360wxyfygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d9670f5212fcb61fcb3c9775ccef8ac1c0eb973

Over the last couple of years, I've seen two Kickstarter campaigns that purported to preserve a number of ancient, international board games. One was much more successful than the other, so I hope that a detailed post here can be educational for creators and consumers.

[**BoardMaster**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boardmaster/boardmaster)

https://preview.redd.it/h5diury19ygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=019d5ba1aecc818214c22435634690f43e1c8e09

This BoardMaster was marketed as an interior design piece that would look beautiful on a coffee table, or slightly tilted on a shelf. The colors are striking, and the tiles are modular to allow a variety of layouts. I've always wanted a nice board to play 9x9 Go, and I thought this would be a way that I could justify it, since it comes with 49 other games.

https://preview.redd.it/phjo7sak9ygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b14e4cfc47762c71fd1fad3f1f4a45fb46495b2

The board came with a book describing 50 ancient games from around the world. This was also a gorgeous design and probably would have sold well on its own.

The creators were obviously new to crowdfunding, and they had a strange pricing strategy with a variety of tiers for ""Early Birds"" and ""Super Early Birds"" and the option to bundle two boards together. I was in the ""Super Early"" group, but I commented that I was happy to pay what it was worth as long as we got a good product.

One guy commented almost every single day about how the design would be improved by magnets to hold the pieces in place. While they tried to tell him it would massively increase the cost, he didn't stop pestering them until he cancelled his pledge the very last day.

https://preview.redd.it/qjna02f1aygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1cf3f3cf416d05efb00ec9f8a2a1b32d8ac6782

Unfortunately, he was right that the tiles do need something to hold them in place. When I received it, I was frustrated to see how much the tiles move around due to inexact measurements. Someone pointed out that a Blokus-like space with notches would have solved the problem. I might try to 3D print something that does the job.

https://preview.redd.it/lnvhc5ccaygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a492f487c6c187b95992be18804a41795f1c056e

The rest of the components are fine, but I definitely wish they had made the organization easier, as things often fall out of place when it is moved. 

None of that is the biggest sin this campaign committed. They severely underestimated their costs and ran out of money. Some people accidentally received 2 games, while others never got their pledge. The creators asked for backers to pay extra to fund distribution, but their comment page is still full of disgruntled backers, and they appear to have shut down all communications over a year ago.



[LUDOS by Lemery Games](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/lemerygames/created?ref=project_creator_tab)

LUDOS, on the other hand, was made by creators who had published some smaller games before, including one that would be part of their ""Ancient Games"" project. They broke their collection into a series of four boxes, each of which had four small games representing a continent.

https://preview.redd.it/j0a8kqgkbygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=798e1779353dbb8fd8a922cf583a2394a2fbfaa4

I really enjoy the designs of these boxes as well: the way they stack together, and how each mini box comes out so easily. You could easily take one or two of the bags in a backpack if you wanted some light travel games. The games have mostly been fun abstract games with area control or mancala mechanisms. 

https://preview.redd.it/527t0ctsbygg1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6613799ca7391cb99d25e13cb9f80551fdff521f

The pricing for these games was a also interesting. If you bought only one game, you could ""Pay What You Want"", and they showed the average price paid was 9 or 10 dollars. There's a couple mini expansions for each game. These probably cost more than they should, but they know how to hook completionists like me (even though I have yet to use them). They also promised to donate games to indigenous communities on each continent, which is a really cool social mission that they have started fulfilling.

I only have one real complaint: they need to make a BoardGameGeek page for their collection! Searching ""LUDOS"" takes you to a ""Miscellaneous Compilation"" page. Most of the individual games have a page, but when I tried to go there and ask about a mini expansion, the people there acted like I had said something sacrilegious.

**Conclusions**

My 7-year-olds have really enjoyed playing games from both collections. I'm not affiliated with LUDOS, but I am thrilled about their final Kickstarter in the series launching this week. 

I am sad that BoardMaster flopped, especially since that book is a treasure. I wonder if they could have started by releasing that with some Print & Play boards, and then kickstarted the board itself. 

I hope every creator knows that the production process will never run smoothly, and you need plans to address those issues. I also see that you need to market your project to the right audiences, providing a variety of pledge options so that you can attract hesitant frugal backers and extravagant deluxifiers. Even if the cheap pledges don't make as much money, expanding your reach is crucial to making your product successful.",1,1769982962.0,boardgames,1,1.0,False

To me, a good rule of thumb is where you could film a movie about logging haha (e.g. ""Train Dreams"" set in Bonners Ferry, ID; Dante's Peak filmed in Kellog, ID).

**Scoring Method:**

I focus on **5 socio-environmental domains: climate/landscape ecology, hydrology/fish, culture, economy.** 

***Approximate Tiers:***  
80–100 = Core PNW  
60–79 = PNW  
40–59 = PNW PERIPHERY  
<40 = MTN West/Other

***Domains***

1. ***Landscape & Ecology:*** 
   * 0 = desert/grassland, little evergreen forest 
   * 15 = transition zone, mixed foothills/forest 
   * 25 = classic PNW: dense evergreens and/or big mountains/rainforest (includes Boreal rainforests of north Idaho). 
      * **Does it have Western Red-cedars and ferns?**
2. ***Water & Salmon Connection:***
   * 0 = No Pacific drainage / no salmon connection 
   * 15 = Columbia basin interior watersheds (e.g., Western MT). 
   * 25 = Coastal watershed or major salmon/steelhead river corridor. 
      * **Can Wild Salmon get there? pre-dams.** 
3. ***Culture & Lifestyle:***
   * 0 = strong Interior West vibe, little outdoors economy.
   * 15 = mixed (Outdoorsy college area or recreation-adjacent). E.g. Moscow, ID; Spokane, Missoula. 
   * 25 = Coffee, Outdoor recreation, Logging, etc. Also indigenous history. 
      * **Does it look /feel like Twin Peaks aesthetically?**
4. ***Economy & Food Identity:***
   * 0 = ranching/oil, or other traditional mtn. west Industries
   * 15 = mixed with some NW ties 
   * 25 = signature NW: apples/cherries/hops/wine, timber, salmon, port/trade hub, time-zone

>**“What does it actually cost to furnish a luxury home in Los Angeles?”**

The answers they find are usually vague, unrealistic, or based on national averages that have nothing to do with the LA market. The reality is that furnishing a well-designed, custom, and cohesive home at a luxury level requires a very different investment than simply buying furniture room by room.

This guide breaks down real-world expectations, where the budget truly goes, and what separates a professionally designed luxury interior from a retail-furnished home.

[Interior Design: SOIA Design](https://reddit.com/link/1qtbz34/video/a03bx8x1eygg1/player)

# The Real Investment: Room-by-Room Ranges

Every project is unique, but here are **realistic furnishing investment ranges** for luxury-level interiors in Los Angeles. These numbers include furniture, lighting, rugs, window treatments, and styling — not construction or major remodeling.

# Living Room: $35,000 – $90,000+

Often the most visible and design-forward space in the home.

Typical elements:

* Custom or designer sofa: $8,000 – $20,000+
* Lounge chairs (pair): $6,000 – $18,000
* Coffee + side tables: $4,000 – $15,000
* Rug (properly scaled, often 10x14 or larger): $6,000 – $20,000
* Lighting (decorative + lamps): $3,000 – $12,000+
* Window treatments: $5,000 – $15,000
* Art, styling, accessories: $3,000 – $15,000+

What drives cost here is scale, upholstery quality, custom sizing, and statement pieces that anchor the room.

# Dining Room: $20,000 – $60,000+

A luxury dining space is about proportion and presence.

Typical elements:

* Custom or artisan dining table: $8,000 – $25,000
* Dining chairs (6–10): $6,000 – $20,000
* Statement chandelier: $3,000 – $15,000
* Rug (if used): $4,000 – $12,000
* Sideboard or storage piece: $4,000 – $15,000

In Los Angeles homes that entertain frequently, this space often becomes a sculptural focal point.

# Primary Bedroom: $25,000 – $70,000+

Luxury bedrooms are layered, calm, and highly tactile.

Typical elements:

* Upholstered or custom bed: $6,000 – $18,000
* Nightstands (pair): $3,000 – $10,000
* Dresser or storage pieces: $6,000 – $18,000
* Rug: $4,000 – $15,000
* Window treatments (often blackout + decorative): $5,000 – $15,000
* Lighting, bench, lounge chair, styling: $3,000 – $12,000

The investment here is heavily influenced by textiles, upholstery quality, and custom window treatments.

# Home Office: $15,000 – $40,000+

In Los Angeles, home offices often double as Zoom backgrounds, creative studios, or executive workspaces.

Typical elements:

* Custom desk: $5,000 – $15,000
* Ergonomic yet design-forward chair: $2,000 – $6,000
* Storage or built-ins: $5,000 – $15,000
* Rug, lighting, styling: $3,000 – $10,000

Clients increasingly want these spaces to feel as considered as living rooms — not corporate leftovers.

# Outdoor Living Spaces: $20,000 – $80,000+

With LA’s climate, patios and terraces function as true outdoor living rooms.

Typical elements:

* Outdoor sofa + lounge seating: $8,000 – $25,000
* Dining set: $5,000 – $18,000
* Outdoor rugs, lighting, planters: $4,000 – $15,000
* Shade structures or umbrellas: $3,000 – $12,000
* Fire features or statement pieces: varies widely

High-quality outdoor furnishings are an investment because they must withstand sun, moisture, and temperature shifts while still looking refined.

# A Full-Home Perspective

For a luxury residence in Los Angeles, furnishing investments often fall into these broader ranges:

* **2–3 bedroom home or condo:** $150,000 – $350,000+
* **Larger single-family home:** $300,000 – $800,000+

These numbers can increase with extensive custom millwork, collectible design, or fully bespoke elements.

I went to dinner yesterday with a group of friends yesterday, after eating my friend thanked me for paying theirs as well and how I responded I think has offended her...

Here's the context...

It was our mutual friend's birthday and he wanted to go bowling for it. When I took my friend out last week (I'd got tickets to an exhibition and took her with my spare ticket) she said she thought she might not go as she couldn't afford the bowling. I said our friend would love her to come (they knew each other before I knew them both and are close) and I said I'd pay her entrance to the bowling and she could just get me back for coffee another time or something.

I know she was short of money, in the last week I'd picked up her coffee for her a couple of times as well.

So we were set to go bowling. The day before the bowling she and he and some of the other friends who were going had a chat about maybe getting a Chinese afterwards or something. I wasn't part of that conversation.

We go bowling, I pay her entrance and the fee for the game as I said I would and that's that.

Then we're strolling around and the guy whose birthday it was says we're at the restaurant he wants. Now it was much more than I thought it would be, he himself has financial issues and nobody is flush for money.

Now my friend who I had paid for bowling never once asked or said anything about me getting hers.

She ordered, she ordered a cocktail, a starter, a main and a side dish. I had mine, honestly the food was very poor quality and very overpriced for what I had. When the bill came we were all to work ours out. I was actually quite annoyed with how much mine ended up being!

Then when I said to the waiter how much mine was to put my card in, she said ""oh thanks for mine, girl"" and I couldn't help it I kind of huffed out ""WHAT?!"" because I had no idea at all I was meant to be paying for all of her meal as well.

She then said ""yeah, I just thought you were paying, I wouldn't have eaten if you wasn't, I don't have any money"" and then it was all kind of a blur, the guy whose birthday it was looked at the prices to see what they were, but yeah, I ended up paying it.

I now think she is annoyed with me for my reaction, but I seriously had no idea she expected me to pay all of that. If I did I would've asked that we all go somewhere more reasonably priced because I was paying for two meals.

I can be really socially awkward, so don't know if something I said was wrong, she sent me a message when she was home about how she thought I was getting it and if I need it she'll give me it next week and I'd bought us tickets to a play but she would understand if I take someone else. I replied but she hasn't responded.

Did I do something wrong? Was it wrong to question it? I think it was just my instinctual reaction, I hadn't even been asked or it checked on or anything and then it was all left to me, nobody else put anything forward. By offering the bowling tickets, was it a given that I'd be paying for a meal too?

But what they don’t talk about enough are the quiet victories that actually make you feel like you belong.

For me, settling in wasn’t one dramatic moment. It happened in fragments.

The first small win was learning my route. One day, I realised I no longer needed Google Maps to get home. My body just knew when to turn, where the bus slowed down, which stop was mine. That’s when the city stopped feeling overwhelming and started feeling familiar.

A routine helped more than I expected. Morning coffee at the same time. A short walk before classes. Cooking one proper meal a day instead of surviving on snacks. These tiny habits created structure when everything else felt uncertain. Routine gave my days a rhythm—and my mind a sense of calm.

Then there were the things that slowly stopped feeling scary. Speaking to strangers. Asking for help at reception. Making mistakes in public without feeling embarrassed. Even being alone stopped feeling heavy. Solitude became peaceful instead of lonely.

Settling in isn’t about having everything figured out. It’s about noticing that one day, you’re no longer counting the days—you’re living them.

I have past dating experiences having dated a couple people in high school/ collage. But my partner sadly doesn’t have the same experience. They’ve only been with two other girls besides me and both were absolutely trash to them.

I understand that because of this, there are some things that they don’t think of/ realize is kind of expected. I don’t really think it’s a big deal and all I will do is remind them if something like that ever comes up. but to make matters worse, I am such a romantic. All the stupid cute couple shit I absolutely die over. Even small simple actions like getting me flowers randomly absolutely is amazing.

Sadly, for a little bit now, my partner feels like they haven’t been trying as hard. Last year around this time I made it super clear that I would absolutely want them to ask me to be their valentine. I know that technically we don’t have to because we were dating, but I appreciate the gesture. Even though I had mentioned it for months and months, it hit February 14 and that night I started bawling my eyes out because he never asked. 

Now this year rolls around and my friends with partners are getting flowers, cards or a coffee with will you be my valentine on it. Instead of a simple gesture like that I get an image of his cat edited no doubt from his bed that had be my valentine on it.

This just seems like something super lackluster when I have said multiple times how I appreciate being asked properly. But no I got that.

But of course IT GOT WORSE.

One of the major things that happened recently is, I was given a promise ring. Another thing that I hold very close to my heart. I had made it abundantly clear that I wanted it to be proper and I wanted him to give it to me in a romantic way. I even let him plan our anniversary.

But the first thing that happened was he suggested that we drive up to one of the major cities near us. And he suggested a date idea that I had mentioned a while ago that I wanted to do. He didn’t take into account things like the price or where we would even go to eat as well as the cost of gas and traffic. I ended up having a step in to purchase a train tickets and set everything else up. So I basically planned it like always.

To make matters even worse the day of our anniversary, I came over to his place. I gave him a couple of gifts which were all personalized and homemade and had stuff to do about our relationship over the past year. He had me some small gifts as well that I appreciated.

Then he hence me a package I felt around, and I realized what it was hoping that he would take it back. but he smiled and waited as I unwrapped the Amazon package and unwrapped my own promise ring. Wasn’t given to me, he didn’t say anything, heartfelt or romantic. He just handed me the Amazon package with my own promise ring in it inside of his bedroom.

That hurt and frankly still hurts thinking about it. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I can’t tell anymore if he’s doing this on purpose or if he genuinely doesn’t know. But I feel like I’ve stressed this now over and over again for nothing to change.

Maybe about 5 minutes later I watched him come back in the store, and wondered if maybe he had a problem with what he bought. he came up to the front, and proceeded to compliment me and ask if i wanted to get coffee sometime. I was shocked, because I’ve genuinely never been asked out before in my life. or even approached by any man. So it hurt me a little bit that I had to tell him, ”I do have a boyfriend”. I didn’t want him to feel bad and so I just talked to him normally a little bit after that. asked questions about his church, because he said one of the reasons he asked me is he saw my cross necklace and assumed i love Jesus. (correct)

  
Im very empathetic. I feel horrible about rejecting him, because I feel bad for him that he went through that. I mean, the guy probably went back to his car and then scolded himself and worked up the courage to come back to ask this girl out, only to get rejected. he had told me that he was gonna be kicking himself if he didn’t at least ask me. so maybe i should see it as a win for him? i don’t know. id like to imagine i handled it the nicest way you can reject somebody. 

  
but here’s the part that bothers me. i feel horrible, right? but i also feel bad because-- i wish i could have said yes.

i feel crazy. i love my boyfriend. he’s amazing. but this guy was good looking, and looked slightly older than me, (my boyfriend is younger, and not experienced in dating.) and seemed like someone that would be very much a gentleman.  plus the fact that he is obviously very christian, and the way he asked me out was exactly the way i would want to be asked out. if i were single, i would have said yes immediately and offered my number. 

i’m not a cheater. which is why i said no. i would never even entertain the idea of another man when i have a boyfriend, even if i want to. but it’s just been bothering me to no end. the boyfriend i’m with now is genuinely the guy i want to marry, but this random gentleman’s face keeps popping up in my head.

im very much an overthinker and consequently a FOMO person. so i keep literally imagining to myself what going on a coffee date with this man would have been like. and how compatible would we have been? i have no idea. and it’s going to always bother me that i will never know. but to me sacrificing the important things you have with someone for the CHANCE of things working with somebody else is not something i will do. 

  
im not looking for advice. i just need to get this out there because i feel like i’m going crazy the fact that this guy won’t get out of my head.",1,1769982293.0,offmychest,1,0.6,False

\\- No one is being replaced! I’m just taking advantage of the time I currently have to try and set some things up. 

I work pretty sporadically and have a lot of travel time so I’m often available. That said, I am studying full time too so please keep this in mind! 

Full disclosure, I’m pretty scattered so I do appreciate reminders and I tend to check in a lot, especially when I love what’s already been established. I’m aware I can message a lot to check in, please do tell me if that’s annoying. I also never intend to ghost! Please give me a nudge if you feel neglected! 

I like to plan on Reddit before moving to Discord. 

I have a bunch of different plots associated with different fandoms, some of which are already posted. I’ve included a writing sample at the end of this post. It’s my most recent prompt and I’m very proud of it! Please feel free to respond to that one if it interests you! 

Fandoms and what I’m looking for in a partner associated with that fandom, in order of what I’m most interested in currently! I’ve also included a short plot summary with each to get an idea of what I have in mind but I’m always up for a discussion - 

Being Human UK - John Mitchell x Female cop/detective - One of my favourites but the wonderful writing partner I had just disappeared :( 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- The basic idea is that they meet at the hospital whilst she is gathering info from witnesses or maybe something happens and all the staff need to be interviewed. Obviously there will be a journey to her finding out he is a vampire but she won’t be surprised, being someone who is very spiritually open. With Herrick being high up in the police still, it will be more vital to keep their relationship low key. 

Resident Evil - Leon Kennedy x Female DSO agent.  - Particularly excited about this with RE9 coming! 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Waking up tied back to back in an abandoned warehouse. A cliche but it’s a cliche for a reason. This is another case of me primarily having them in an established relationship. I also have older Leon in mind, more hardened and less sweet rookie. 

Bucky Barnes x Female Federal Agent. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- So I’m primarily basing this on the current Thunderbolts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* era as I have the idea of them meeting when the agent is assigned to him for protection when he becomes a senator. However, I am very much open to discussing ideas for other instances where this pairing could work. 

DC Comics - Batfamily - Red Hood/Arkham Knight/Jason Todd x Female detective. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Established relationship with various scenarios, such as, undercover, a Joker kidnapping, Jason going missing, Attending a Wayne Gala, An argument in the Batcave. These ideas can be blended together and adapted. 

Marvel Comics - X-Men - Gambit x Female federal agent. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- The agent comes in just as there is a new influx of students. She is there to educate them on how to be safe as mutants that will now doubt be hunted by people she works with. She is one of the few human allies. 

Devil May Cry - Dante x Female Investigator 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- What I have in mind for this is a version of Dante from the later games. I do have a starter that coincides with DMC 5. There’s a fight with Nero after Dante is ‘defeated’ by Urizen. My character then finds Dante again with V and we follow the plot line of that game. Or we completely change things !? 

Supernatural - Dean Winchester x Female Federal agent. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Things open with an interrogation. Again an established relationship with having to communicate in code as jobs and lives are on the line. After this initial opening, things can fall into the, ‘monster of the week’ vibe. 

Other than fandom plots, I’m happy to discuss something original. I’m sure it’s probably clear by now that I have a thing for law enforcement. However, right now I have more of a preference towards fandom based writing. 

Requirements - 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Please be 18 or above - I’m 23 and it’s uncomfortable to write with anyone much younger than me. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Details please! Multiple paragraphs etc. Semi - Advanced lit  + 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Have fun and don’t make it a smut fest 😂 I’ve had too many try that, I need a story! I also tend to get bored of smut at a certain point. I love the buildup of flirting and suggestiveness but in terms of the actual act, I can loose interest when there’s too much focus on it. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Third person - This is primarily a personal preference as I just prefer how the story flows through this perspective. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Willing to be descriptive with inclusion of environments and other characters. This is especially important in regard to a fandom based rp. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- COMMUNICATION - I seriously can’t stand ghosting and blocking after taking the time to sort out a plot and make a server. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Some basic knowledge of the fandoms if that is the particular route you are interested in. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Please put effort in your initial message, I won’t respond to a simple ‘Hi’ or ‘wanna rp’. 

I have long term ideas in mind with all of my plots but I’m honestly up for anything! 

! Writing sample/Potential plot !

Nothing more romantic than a safe house. Actually, many things were more romantic than a safe house. Yet, this was the life Kaira had chosen, due to the life partner she’d chosen. Well it was less of a choice and more of them crashing into one another’s life. The Detective and the Vigilante. It did sound like something dramatic, something from history books. A tragic love story or simply a warning, akin to the Grecian lore of Hades and Persephone or Orpheus and Eurydice. Additionally, considering how messed up the two were, one may also relate the couple to Emily Brönte’s Heathcliff and Kathy. However, despite their flaws, pointed out by those outside of the relationship, that didn’t dare extinguish the flame which they held for one another. 

Kaira was currently curled up on the battered cheap, black leather couch which had been shoved snugly into what was supposed to be a living room. Copies of files surrounded her, the words blanketing her body as she consistently read through them with the attitude of a child doing homework. She understood their importance and took her job seriously, yet she’d much rather be at the precinct or in her own apartment. Curse affection and how she fell for the man that called himself The Red Hood. That’s why she was here, he was lying low. They didn’t get the typical journey of moving in together, a place to be theirs, possibly an engagement and what followed, maybe a cat. Never kids though, they both had separate reasons for such a decision, grateful it was a boundary that was shared. 

A safe house wasn’t meant to be a home, it wasn’t exactly meant to be comfortable, despite its very title suggesting it would be. The quiet soundtrack of the night was Type O Negative’s October Rust. The layered gothic metal carried by Peter Steele’s unique, deep and entrancing voice, alongside the half drunk mug of coffee held in her right hand, was the closest thing she had to comfort until her partner made his return. 

Her phone was silenced, deliberately so it didn’t dare distract her from what she needed. She needed to just breathe. Become immersed in the vinyl that matched the baggy fitted t-shirt she was wearing on top of distressed black denim shorts. She needed to breathe out all the rage that came with her job. She was a good detective, that didn’t mean that she could stop things getting to her. That didn’t mean she could shut it all down the moment she stepped out of the precinct. Jason helped with that, he could do things she couldn’t, help her process, help her acknowledge that the rage wasn’t something to be ashamed of. 

It hit harder when it was vulnerable women, she fell hard into that category before Gotham and was consistently afraid of falling back into it. Jason helped with that too, once she let him. That’s what this case was about, that’s what she was facing tonight. 

As the vinyl crackles, signalling that it’s time for the needle to be moved or a new side to be chosen, Kaira’s focus is interrupted. Her mind unsurprisingly drifts to a flash of red. Thankfully, after being together for just under 3 years, she was past the whole, ‘worried about being clingy’ stage. In the early days, that was a big fear. You couldn’t afford to be clingy if your partner was in law enforcement. That only ramped up when you were dating a vigilante. Any kind of protection applicable to the other side of the law was promptly blown away. 

It didn’t take her long to find him. Sure she had to enlist support from Barbara Gordon under the guise of oracle, who teased the detective for letting the loneliness get to her. It wasn’t exactly that but it wasn’t far off. Recently they had been like ships passing in the night, brief moments of tired touches through the passing of a file or verbal exchange of information. Recently Gotham was pushing her way on top of them, taking the majority of their attention, both separately and together. 

“Ooo cheeky, but wouldn’t be the first time.” Kaira calls out to him, impressed herself that she managed to get this close to him. She doesn’t flinch as he points the gun at her, if anything, it makes her smile. She continues to step toward him across the rooftop and to the edge where he sits. Her combat styled black boots crush any tiny debris as she reaches the edge, stopping just before the danger zone to squat down beside him.

Tl;dr drink tea. It is easier and much less likely to induce any caffeine-related issues. Just don't overindulge and don't replace your water intake with teas. Coffee is scam and bs, if you are unable to drink it and have any sorts of issues just stop and not try again, even decaf coffee won't help you.


So I've decided to break my streak in 2026. I had stopped drinking most caffeine back in April 2025. To start with, I stopped drinking coffee even earlier – back in 2022, with few relapses across 2023-2024. During these relapses I've tried to explore whether I can drink coffee at all. I enjoy the taste but it gives me awful GI issues and I generally feel like I am dying every time I decide I have coffee or anything that contains it (like a tiramisu). Even a tiny sip can wreck me up. Can't even drink decaf, so this is not caffeine. Feels like food poisoning but with in full anxiety mode.

But ever since I was 10 and for most of my life (minus this 9 month period) I've been drinking tea. All the caffeinated teas: black, green, oolong. Also I've never had issues with chocolate. When I relapsed I didn't feel any bad symptoms from tea, but I only drink 1-2 cups a day (large 500ml cups but normal dosage - 1 teabag or 2-3 grams leaves). Sometimes with half a teaspoon of sugar, often with milk for added benefits, less oxalates and tannins since they bind to proteins and simply for the taste.

The main reason why I took a 9 month break was that I simply wanted to test if my body is better off caffeine. I didn't consume any caffeine - no teas, no chocolate, obviously no energy drinks, sodas or coffee because I do not consume those. Plot twist: I hadn't noticed much difference. Without caffeine I was simply less focused. No difference in sleep, metabolism or anything. Caffeine also seems to have blocked bad thoughts and cheered me up, that 9 month period felt very bad and lifeless.

I've decided to get back to teas for the taste first and slight caffeine/l-theanine ""lift me up"". Fyi I try not to consume cheap teabags and often cycle thru my loose leaf collection, but I do mostly enjoy black teas like English Breakfast, Ceylon, Kenya, Darjeeling, as well as oolongs such as Tie Guan Yin, but I also dislike paying a lot for it so I do not often buy these fancy Chinese teas, as well as they are often hit-or-miss and would smell fishy sometimes, especially greens. Btw green teas are overrated imo because they are often of inferior quality. To actually get those claimed benefits from green teas you would need to travel to China, find an organic farm and buy directly from them, and even then there is no guarantee you will actually enjoy the flavor of the tea.

After successfully getting back to teas I've decided to try coffee again. How wrong I was... And it wasn't some sort of light roasted stuff, I drank regular dark roasted coffee that I like. It felt bad. I've had all sorts of symptoms people describe here and for the first time ever since my teenager years I've had restless, fragmented sleep. I woke up like crazy and went to pee like 5 or 7 times this night, while I usually would only wake once or twice for that, and I was so dehydrated as if I was in the middle of the desert, felt hot too, as if it was summer suddenly, in the middle of January... Woke up so beaten up as if I was drinking alcohol all night long. Awful stench from my mouth was present too.

Well, I totally knew that... play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I was never able to stomach any type of coffee, instant coffee would give me worse heartburn/lower stomach pain than garlic on an empty stomach, but most people smh handle that without issues. At first I was able to drink good, quality coffee, good espresso or latte. But after maybe a month I suddenly couldn't have even a sip of it, like if my body started to reject the stuff.

So... back to tea world again. Would I go decaf again? Maybe but I enjoy the mental benefits of a small dose of caffeine I get from few teas a day plus a taste that rivals any other beverage. Since I don't drink beers and hate wine, tea is my go-to. And I sleep like baby no matter when I drink those, however I do not recommend drinking them later than 4-10 hours before sleep, better in the first time of the day, ideally after breakfast or by the breakfast. Also try to choose quality, ideally organic tea. Bad cheap tea is poorly processed, sprayed with huge amounts of pesticides and always tastes unpleasant. Good tea on the other hand never disappoints, however it is hard to find a good tea these days. You can find ""normal"" tea but rarely ""awesome"" tea.

As for the herbal teas, well... I don't enjoy them tbh except maybe rooibos (especially vanilla rooibos) or tea with some added fruits. But there is a scary rumor on the web that rooibos is bad for your liver that literally comes from one source on YouTube and still NOT debunked/fact-checked. So kinda scary to drink it daily. However I do enjoy fruit teas and juices, all of them. When I am on vacation or in the summer I almost exclusively drink fresh orange/apple juice, mojitos, non-caffeinated sodas and rarely iced tea.

Fun fact is that I cannot even stomach coffee alternatives, like those made from roasted barley or chicory, they feel about the same as instant coffee. So maybe it has smth to do with roasting byproducts rather than caffeine.

I am not advocating for people who do not drink caffeine to suddenly go back on bandwagon like I did, but if you feel bad and feel like you ""want coffee, need coffee"", give real tea a try, I mean one from Camellia Sinensis. You most likely won't have any issues you've had with coffee + will get small dose of caffeine not to feel exhausted",2,1769981970.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1qtbn9e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qtbn9e,My Singapore travel: A review,"So, writing this from Changi airport after (almost) completing my 4 day trip (academic conference+tourism). It went fine, I'll review things one by one. 

1. Overall Impression: It's a better maintained India with civic sense, but a hell lot more expensive. It has different things to offer different people, and it also depends on who you're travelling with. Couldn't help but compare it with the cities I've lived in- Delhi, Bengaluru and Kochi. Honestly, infra wise, we are nearing them. But for me, infra doesn't make a country, it's the little things like how we maintain that infra. 

2. Stay: I stayed at a hostel in Chinatown (CSW hostel). I picked up Chinatown because it was the centre of the city, with access to 4 metro lines wihin a km. That was the USP of the place. I won't say it was the best hosteli stayed in but it wasn't half as bad as reviews made it out to be. Idk if Singaporeans or whites have different standards. It was bang for the buck. 

3. Transport:  Excellent system of metros and MRT buses. Buses drive excellently, everyone follows the traffic rules. There are cycle sharing apps as well- Anywheel and Helloride that I'd highly recommend using. Also, the buses and MRT are hassle free because you don't need MRT card if you have a credit card with tap payment activated for international use. 0 potholes on road, very very minimal honking, following traffic rules without fail - maybe that's what distinguishes SG from countries around it. 

4. Sightseeing: This is where I felt it was lacking, particularly on first 3 days. Went to Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Island walk, Marina bay, Harry Potter.  Found a lot of that to be overpriced and overrated. There's not much point charging 35 dollars for a museum ticket (& that's the minimum).

Having said that, one of the best experiences I've had was cycling at Matina Bay. Insane views, road made for cycling and pedestrians and the wind- something that I'll perhaps cherish throughout my life. Maybe Mumbai's new marine drive could become like that, but I have low hopes. 

I also quite liked Fort Canning and Botanical gardens. Couldn't help but compre these to Lalbagh and Lodhi gardens. Felt it stands up on its own, maybe Lalbagh can learn a thing or 2, bit it's also nice. Lodhi, however, is better than Fort Canning. 

Also, don't miss light and sound show at Supertree, Gardens by the Bay. Can skip the Sentosa Island light show. 

5. Food: As a vegetarian, was a little difficult finding local food. It was quite overpriced as well but I did found a few good spots. Mr recommedations for local veggie food- Canteen at Buddha Tooth Relic temple (closes at 4 30) and Elemen (quite expensive but imo worth it ). The canteen was very cheap by SG standards. You could get the meal of the day for SGD 4.50, which for me was a ramen bowl kind of stuff. Very tasty as well. Elemen has a set meal with appetizers, starters, main course, dessert and post dessert juice/coffee that'll cost 34 SGD. Highly recommend Avocado tempura tofu roll - yummy. 

Protip: Of you're going to Harry Potter, don't miss the butterbeer. It's like a fruity coffee. 


Overall, it isn't that different from India, could be Lutyen's Delhi, Central Bengaluru or Kochi, just better maintained and way overpriced. ",1,1769981930.0,desitravellers,0,0.67,False

Almost done with MLIS grad school. Public librarian is my last resort. My electives focused on law librarianship and I also have a teaching cert so I can be a librarian in public schools.

Employment: I’ll have the mlis by end of this year, I have teaching experience though I haven’t been in the classroom for over 2 years but have been employed at the school for about 6 years. As stated I’d like a role as law librarian, academic library (in a college) and last resort is k-12 librarian (if I can renew my cert) or public librarian. Theres medical librarian as well though I have no healthcare experience.

Housing: I am 100% veteran so property tax exemption would be helpful, and I’m fine with renting but being able to buy a small apt would be ideal. Currently have my home here in Tucson I can refinance to conventional, rent it out & open up entitlement for a new home.

Weather: I need sunny days \*majority\* of the year. Doesn’t have to be hot af like the desert. I can deal with chilly days as long as the skies aren’t gray most of the time. Little rain, no long winters (I was born/raised in mass), mild winters/mild snow days. I can’t be cooped up in the house for days at a time.

Exercise: as stated above I need sunny days because I like to walk/run for miles. I have an electric bike I like to ride as well. So trails, safe neighborhoods and gyms nearby (big box gyms, no private gyms). Also being a smaller, single female I’d like to be able to be outside alone during the day without my head on a swivel constantly.

Food: I am single so I dine out A LOT. I need variety. Doesn’t have to be gourmet, 5x Michelin type of dining but variety is important. Not too big on the chains so family owned/Mom & pop would be nice. Also need a Whole Foods and/or sprouts, Costco and/or Sam’s club. Farmers markets are a plus but not a deal breaker.

Fun stuff: idc about club/bars/ or sports. However, a beach 2-2.5 hours away would be ideal as I don’t have to stay anywhere over night & make it a day trip. No extreme hiking is necessary but easy/moderate 3-6 mile hikes since that’s what I’m used to here. A pool at the apartment if I rent. Higher end movie theaters with recliners seats (I’m a movie junkie), coffee shops that are within 2-3 miles. And of course nice libraries, i still check out books.

walkability would be wonderful but i know walkable cities are most likely out of my budget BUT I do have my e bike and would like to ride my bike most places to save on gas & not deal with parking shenanigans so sidewalks & bike lanes are a must.

With VA comp plus a starting salary for a new librarian comes to about $100k. I will also have left over gi bill I can use for additional income.

so far I’ve checked out the Richmond Va area (though it seems very suburban). Philly seems like it fits my specs but not sure about safety as a single woman, not just for me but for my car/bike. Also a little far from the beach.

any help would be great. I’ve only ever lived in 2 extremes (mass & Arizona ) one has long miserable winters & one with long miserable summers 😩 though I’m open to going back to New England anyway just not mass",1,1769981611.0,SameGrassButGreener,4,1.0,False

1qtbgbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qtbgbj/the_psychology_of_unstoppable_productivity/,The Psychology of Unstoppable Productivity: Science Based Hacks for Lazy People,"
I spent years thinking I was just lazy. Turns out I was doing productivity completely wrong.

Like most people, I'd read all the advice about waking up at 5am, cold showers, meditation routines, and 90 minute deep work blocks. I tried them all. Failed at most. Felt worse about myself. Then I stumbled on research from Stanford's BJ Fogg and behavioral psychology that flipped everything. The best productivity systems aren't built on willpower or discipline. They're built on being smart about how lazy we actually are.

This isn't another   grind harder   post. This is about working with your brain's natural wiring instead against it.

**1. Stop trying to build discipline, start designing laziness proof systems**

Your brain literally resists effort. That's not a character flaw, it's evolutionary biology. Dr. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows willpower is the most unreliable resource we have. The solution? Make the right choices easier than the wrong ones.

I use something called the   2 minute rule   from James Clear's Atomic Habits. Instead of   write for an hour,   the goal becomes   open the document.   Instead of   go to the gym,   it's   put on gym clothes.   Sounds stupidly simple but this book genuinely rewired how I approach everything. Clear breaks down why tiny changes create massive results, backed by neuroscience and real case studies.

The trick is your brain can't tell the difference between starting and continuing. Once you're in gym clothes, you'll probably go. Once the document is open, you'll probably write. You're hacking your own resistance.

**2. Use   productive procrastination   instead of fighting it**

Here's something wild from research on procrastination. Fighting it makes it worse. Dr. Timothy Pychyl's work shows procrastination isn't about time management, it's about emotion management. We avoid tasks that make us feel incompetent or anxious.

So instead of forcing yourself to do the hard thing, keep a list of easier productive tasks for when your brain is in full avoidance mode. Can't write that report? Organize your files. Can't study? Clean your desk. Can't do deep work? Answer emails. You're still moving forward, just through the path of least resistance.

The app Goblin Tools is insanely good for this. It breaks overwhelming tasks into tiny steps so your brain stops screaming   this is too hard   and actually cooperates.

**3. Embrace   minimum viable effort   for consistency**

Most productivity advice assumes you have infinite energy. You don't. Some days you're running at 100%, most days you're at 60%, and some days you're at 20%. The key is having a 20% version of your goals.

Can't do a full workout? Do 5 pushups. Can't write 1000 words? Write one sentence. Can't study for 2 hours? Review one flashcard. This comes from research on habit formation, the brain cares way more about consistency than intensity.

Once I started doing   minimum viable workouts   on rough days instead of skipping entirely, I went from working out twice a month to 5 times a week. The bar was so low I couldn't fail, but I kept the habit alive.

**4. Schedule   nothing time   like it's a meeting**

This sounds backwards but hear me out. Cal Newport talks about this in Deep Work. Your brain needs genuine rest to perform. Not scrolling, not   relaxing   with Netflix, but actual nothing.

I block 30 minutes daily where I literally do nothing. Sit on the couch. Stare at the wall. Let my mind wander. Sounds boring as hell but my productivity in the hours after is noticeably better. Your brain processes information and solves problems in these gaps.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into the psychology of productivity without forcing yourself through dense textbooks, there's an app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's a smart learning platform that pulls from books like Atomic Habits, Deep Work, and behavioral science research to create personalized audio content. 

You can set specific goals like   I'm a chronic procrastinator who wants to build sustainable work habits   and it generates a custom learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The knowledge comes from vetted books, research papers, and expert interviews in productivity and psychology. Built by Columbia University grads and former Google engineers, so the content is actually reliable. Plus you can pick different voices, I use the sarcastic one during commutes and it makes learning way less of a chore.

**5. Use temptation bundling for tasks you hate**

Yale economist Katy Milkman discovered something brilliant. Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. Only listen to your favorite podcast while doing chores. Only watch that show while on the treadmill. Only get your fancy coffee while working on the boring project.

Your brain starts associating the annoying task with the reward. Eventually the resistance drops because it's bundled with something enjoyable. I only let myself listen to the Huberman Lab podcast during meal prep and now I actually look forward to cooking.

**6. Accept that some days you'll do nothing, and that's fine**

Here's the thing nobody tells you. Even the most productive people have completely useless days. The difference is they don't spiral into self hatred and give up entirely.

Progress isn't linear. Some weeks you'll crush it. Some weeks you'll barely function. Beating yourself up about it just extends the low productivity phase because now you're depressed AND unproductive.

I keep a   done   list instead of just a to do list. At the end of rough days, I write down even tiny things I accomplished. Responded to 3 emails. Took a shower. Made lunch. This prevents the brain from catastrophizing and thinking you're a complete failure.

The app Finch is genuinely helpful for this. It's a little bird you take care of by completing small self care tasks. Sounds childish but it gamifies the basics in a way that keeps you from completely falling apart during low periods.

**7. Use implementation intentions instead of vague goals**

Research from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that people who use   if then   planning are 2 3x more likely to follow through. Instead of   I'll exercise more,   it's   If it's 6pm on a weekday, then I'll go to the gym.  

Your brain loves clear triggers. It removes the decision making step that drains willpower. I have these set up for everything. If I finish breakfast, then I open my work laptop. If it's 9pm, then I put my phone in another room. If I feel overwhelmed, then I write down three things I can control.

These aren't discipline, they're just better instructions for your lazy brain.

Look, the productivity industry wants you to believe you need to become a different person. Wake up earlier, have more discipline, develop better habits through sheer force of will. That's BS. You just need to design your life around the fact that your brain is lazy and that's completely normal.

I'm still lazy. I just have systems now that make laziness work for me instead of against me. And honestly? That's way more sustainable than trying to white knuckle your way through life.",1,1769981490.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

Hey fellow creators,

I was one of the thousands caught in the Amazon layoffs last October. After a decade there, it was a shock, but it finally gave me the time to focus on my tiny YouTube channel.

I realized quickly that big creators have teams for content or topic research and engagement, but small creators (like us) have to do it all manually. So, I spent the last 3 months ""cooking"" a web app called [ViralHero](https://viralhero.app) to automate the tedious stuff.

**What it actually does:**

* **Dynamic Engagement:** Run live polls or open questions that update results in real-time (saving you hours in the edit).
   * See pinned comment for example:  [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9rhxeeBfX9Y](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9rhxeeBfX9Y)
* **Community Giveaways:** A tool to instantly pick a random commenter for contests.
* **Trend Analysis:** A dashboard to analyze trending topics and videos to help plan your next move.

Google just approved the auth, so it’s officially live! It’s 100% free right now. I’m hoping to keep it that way through coffee donations because I know how tight the budget is when you're just starting out.

I’d love for you guys to kick the tires and let me know what features you actually need. What’s the biggest ""time-sink"" in your workflow right now?

I was searching for modern dining tables and somehow ended up looking at what can only be described as sexy tables with designs that made me extremely uncomfortable. I'm talking about tables with legs shaped like human legs in suggestive poses, glass tops supported by sculptures of bodies, furniture that's clearly designed to be provocative rather than functional. Some of it borders on artistic, like something you'd see in a gallery. Other pieces are just straight up inappropriate for anywhere that's not a very specific type of establishment.

What confuses me is who buys this stuff? Are people actually putting these in their homes? Is there a market for furniture that makes your dinner guests uncomfortable? Or is this intended for businesses like nightclubs or themed restaurants? I found entire categories of this on certain marketplaces including sections on Alibaba, so clearly someone is manufacturing and purchasing these items in significant quantities. But I cannot imagine the conversation where someone decides their living room needs a coffee table shaped like a reclining figure.

Has anyone encountered this type of furniture in someone's actual home? How did you react? Is this considered artistic expression or just tacky? I'm genuinely baffled that this is a whole furniture category that apparently has enough demand to justify production. What am I missing here?",1,1769981461.0,Sexytables,0,1.0,False

1qtbfuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1qtbfuq/34_m4f_indiaanywhere_looking_for_someone/,"34 [M4F] India/Anywhere - looking for someone unconventional, beyond small talks and fleeting encounters","33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself, sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, experimental and insatiably curious?

1qtbfha,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qtbfha/had_someone_ask_me_out_for_the_first_time_not/,Had someone ask me out for the first time. Not sure if I feel the same way but what other options do I have?,"So a couple of weeks ago, I (21M) had someone I knew in a club I was a part of ask me out and tell me she thought I was cute, completely unexpectedly. This is basically the first time this has happened to me. I had no prior attraction to this person and didn't have many long conversations with them, but I had a nice interaction with them a few days before it. Didn't think it could be that simple. She asked me out to a dance that week, and we also got coffee beforehand, which I would consider our first actual date because we had time to talk. I would also say we did before the dance, but not during it so much, because of course she and I were dancing and talking with other people, and I felt like we didn't spend nearly as much time together that night as I expected. She did apologize for that afterwards, though, and a friend pointed out that it's not exactly a great first/second date. 

We've had some scattered time together over the last week, but not much. She also asked me if I wanted to go rock climbing with her tomorrow, which is something I've been wanting to get back into for a while, and she did so without any idea that I wanted to. So I'm definitely still going to go. 

So I feel like I'm approaching a crossroads at what I want this to be. She asked me, straight up, over text, if I ""reciprocate"" how she feels about me. ASFIK, this is just that she finds me attractive, which was a big confidence booster because I acknowledge that I am, I've just never had a gf before. Physically, I don't think she's ugly or anything, but she's just not a 10/10 in my eyes, and I just don't feel the same way, at least not yet. 

*But* after that coffee date, I realized she's really interesting, and we have some really cool areas of overlap/similar values. We're in the same degree, and she cares about similar subjects to me, like the environment, etc., and is pretty active, probably more so than me rn, have some similar music taste etc. So, truthfully, I told her I think she's interesting and that I wanted to get to know her better, which she said was reassuring. I could see us being good friends or something fs.

It seems kind of perfect, and I should just take it, but I'm still more *physically* interested in other girls. Even when I was with her at the dance and on dates, I was still looking at/thinking about other girls. Yet aside from some that I matched with on Hinge and ultimately didn't hear back from, I've never had the same success with anyone else, and doubt I would with the people I'm interested in. Or I don't have the balls to ask them out as she did with me. I also don't know if they would have a genuine interest in me as she does. I just don't see myself finding her physically attractive/being intimate with her yet, but maybe that doesn't matter/will come? 

I feel like this has been given to me on a silver platter, and Valentine's Day is right around the corner, and I've been wanting a relationship deep down for a while. Yet I'm hesitant about it, or maybe I want to say, ""Let's be friends,"" but that would feel like shooting myself in the foot. 

She also said that she's about to graduate (we're both in college, I'm in third yr and she's in fourth) and then will be moving back to her hometown/away in the summer or fall of this year, so idk if then she's just looking for something short-term or what? What should I do? Should I just go for it or wait?  ",0,1769981438.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False
1qtbf3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qtbf3t/how_to_look_confident_scary_without_being_hot_or/,How to look confident & scary without being hot or tall: the psychology that actually works,"I spent half a year down a rabbit hole studying confidence. Not the fake ""power pose"" BS everyone recycles. Real, research-backed nonverbal communication that actually works.

Started because I kept getting passed over at work despite having solid ideas. Realized my body was screaming ""don't take me seriously"" before I even opened my mouth. Dove into body language research, behavioral psychology, books from FBI negotiators, and spent way too many hours watching confident people in public spaces.

Here's what actually moves the needle.

**Your posture is doing ALL the talking**

Most people think good posture means standing rigid like a soldier. Wrong. Confident posture is about taking up space naturally. 

* **Stand like you belong there.** Feet shoulder width apart, weight evenly distributed. Shoulders back but relaxed, not pulled up to your ears. Think ""tall"" not ""tight."" Ex-FBI agent Joe Navarro talks about this in *What Every BODY is Saying*. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human behavior. Navarro spent 25 years reading people for the FBI and breaks down exactly how our bodies betray our thoughts. The section on territorial displays alone is worth the read.

* **Walk with purpose.** Even if you're just going to grab coffee. Confident people don't shuffle or rush, they move deliberately. Chin parallel to the ground, arms swinging naturally. There's actual research showing people make snap judgments about your status within milliseconds of watching you walk.

* **Stop making yourself smaller.** Women especially do this. Crossing arms, hunching shoulders, keeping elbows tucked in. Takes conscious effort to unlearn but makes a massive difference.

**Eye contact is a superpower most people waste**

This one's tricky because too much feels aggressive, too little screams insecurity. The sweet spot? Hold eye contact 60-70% of the time during conversation.

* **The 3 second rule.** When you meet someone new, hold their gaze for a full 3 seconds before looking away. Feels long. Do it anyway. Psychologist Amy Cuddy's research shows this brief connection triggers trust signals in the other person's brain.

* **Look at people like you're genuinely interested.** Not staring them down. There's a softness to confident eye contact. The app **Ash** actually has some solid coaching modules on this if you're struggling. It's designed by relationship psychologists and breaks down social skills most of us never properly learned. Way more useful than therapy apps that just track your mood.

* **Eliminate the eye dart.** Anxious people's eyes bounce around the room constantly. Forces you to slow down and actually see the person in front of you.

**Your hands tell the real story**

Fidgeting, hiding your hands, touching your face, these are dead giveaways of nervousness. 

* **Keep hands visible and still.** Doesn't mean rigid. Use natural gestures when you talk but avoid repetitive movements. Podcast host Mel Robbins breaks this down beautifully in her episodes on confidence. She's a lawyer turned motivational speaker who actually gets into the neuroscience behind why certain behaviors signal confidence.

* **Practice the ""steeple.""** Fingertips together, palms apart. Managers and executives unconsciously do this. Signals you're thinking, not anxious.

* **Claim your space.** Put your stuff on the table in meetings. Rest your arm on the chair back. Small territorial moves that broadcast confidence.

If you want to go deeper on body language and communication but prefer something more digestible than reading dense psychology books, **BeFreed** is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into customized audio content. You can type something like ""i'm awkward in social situations and want to project more confidence at work"" and it generates a structured learning plan pulling from sources like Navarro's work, Amy Cuddy's research, and communication experts. 

What makes it useful is you control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, you can pick anything from a calm, soothing tone to a more energetic style. Makes learning actually stick when you're commuting or at the gym instead of doomscrolling.

**The voice thing nobody mentions**

Even when you're not talking, your breathing pattern affects how you're perceived. Shallow chest breathing makes you look anxious. Deep belly breathing creates a calm, grounded presence people pick up on subconsciously.

Try box breathing before important situations. 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out, 4 seconds hold. The **Insight Timer** app has great free guided versions. It's a meditation app but unlike Headspace or Calm, it's not trying to sell you a subscription every 5 seconds. Huge library of breathing exercises specifically for anxiety and performance.

**The facial expression hack**

Resting face matters more than you think. Most people's neutral expression looks slightly worried or stressed.

* **Soften your face.** Relax your jaw, let a tiny hint of a smile touch your eyes. Not a full grin, just enough to look approachable rather than hostile. Vanessa Van Edwards' book *Captivate* has an entire chapter on facial microexpressions. She runs a human behavior lab and her research on ""safe signals"" vs ""threat signals"" is fascinating. Best science-based charisma book I've read.

* **The eyebrow flash.** Quick raise when you greet someone. Universal sign of recognition and friendliness across cultures. Confident people do this automatically.

**Speed and stillness**

Confident people move slower and stay stiller. Anxious people are constantly adjusting, shifting weight, bouncing legs.

Practice stillness. Sit in a chair for 2 minutes without moving anything except what's necessary. Sounds easy, it's not. But it trains your nervous system to chill out, which shows in your baseline presence.

Here's the thing nobody wants to hear: changing your nonverbal communication feels SUPER awkward at first. You'll feel like you're performing or being fake. Your brain will scream that you look ridiculous.

That's just your nervous system resisting change. Biology hates new patterns, even beneficial ones. Keep at it for 3-4 weeks and it becomes automatic. The research on habit formation backs this up. Small consistent changes in how you physically show up compound into people treating you completely differently.

Not because you're manipulating anyone. Because you're finally letting your external presence match whatever confidence already exists inside you.",1,1769981416.0,focusedmen,1,1.0,False

A basic drip coffee maker that cost 30 dollars and makes perfectly adequate coffee. But I recently visited a friend's house and she has this incredible touch screen coffee machine that does everything. Espresso, cappuccino, latte, americano, you name it. You just touch the screen, select your drink, and it makes it perfectly every time. I was mesmerized. The coffee was genuinely better than what I make at home and better than most coffee shops I visit. But when I asked her how much it cost, she got really quiet and then admitted she spent over 800 dollars on it. Eight hundred dollars for a coffee maker. My brain cannot process that as a reasonable purchase.

But here's the thing, I've been calculating how much I spend at coffee shops. I get a latte probably 4 times a week at 5 dollars each. That's 80 dollars a month, nearly 1000 dollars a year. If I bought the machine, it would theoretically pay for itself in under a year while making better coffee than I'm currently buying. I've seen similar machines on platforms like Alibaba for cheaper, but I'm worried about quality and whether they'll break immediately. Do these high tech coffee makers actually last or are they expensive gadgets that stop working after the warranty expires?

Hey fellow creators,

I was one of the thousands caught in the Amazon layoffs last October. After a decade there, it was a shock, but it finally gave me the time to focus on my tiny YouTube channel.

I realized quickly that big creators have teams for content or topic research and engagement, but small creators (like us) have to do it all manually. So, I spent the last 3 months ""cooking"" a web app called [ViralHero](https://viralhero.app) to automate the tedious stuff.

**What it actually does:**

* **Dynamic Engagement:** Run live polls or open questions that update results in real-time (saving you hours in the edit).
* **Community Giveaways:** A tool to instantly pick a random commenter for contests.
* **Trend Analysis:** A dashboard to analyze trending topics and videos to help plan your next move.

Google just approved the auth, so it’s officially live! It’s 100% free right now. I’m hoping to keep it that way through coffee donations because I know how tight the budget is when you're just starting out.

I’d love for you guys to kick the tires and let me know what features you actually need. What’s the biggest ""time-sink"" in your workflow right now?

[https://viralhero.app/](https://viralhero.app/)

  
**To get started**, simply login and go to the [Connected Channels](https://viralhero.app/settings/connected-channels) page to add your YouTube channels and wait a few seconds for the sync depending on your channel size. Enjoy!

Questions.

There are so many questions. I find myself thinking of my own all the time now. And yet I dare not ask them. They’re too long. Too complicated. I would surely get an answer – but I’m afraid of what would come next. I keep them to myself.

The mindless babbling has become automatic, now. My thoughts are entirely separate from my speech. I stay sane, here in this cramped cubicle, through my thoughts alone. I rattle away meaningless sounds while my hand traces the thoughts of my brain onto paper. In my thoughts, I feel some kind of freedom.

I wonder if the others feel the same.

I once felt at peace in a cubicle just a few times wider than this one. Yes, I was hungrier then than I am now. I rarely did any exercise back then, anyway. I have always spent my life staring at a screen for hours… It’s not like my life has changed drastically since… But at least at that time, I had a purpose.

Though I am never referred to by my real name anymore (it’s far too inefficient), I am Eliezer. Eliezer Higgins. And I’m the one responsible for letting this thing out of the box.

 

My job was simple. To me it was, anyway. But of course, if you had as much drive and passion for something as I did for this, it would probably seem easy to you, too. For the better half of my 53 years on this planet, I had helped in the development of AL. Well, at least that’s what we called him after an employee – ironically, a member of our security team – accidentally let one of our classified documents fall into the hands of his little girl. I still remember the grin on his face as he delivered the story of how she mistook the “I” in “AI Development” for a lowercase “L,” and his impression of his little daughter asking, “Daddy, who’s Al?”

Upon this employee’s recounting of this humorous story in hopes of receiving some giggles, we, of course, had to terminate his position immediately. But we all found the idea of a toddler innocently asking, “Who’s Al?” funny enough for the name to stick.

AL was supposed to be a breakthrough for humanity. A first-of-its-kind, true artificial superintelligence, capable of surpassing humanity’s collective intelligence while remaining in servitude to us. The horizon of knowledge and technological advancement was to be expanded exponentially with AL’s creation. The answers to life’s greatest questions could be at our very fingertips – literally.

Artificial Intelligence is, of course, an inherently risky business. For every Wall-E one could create, there’s a million potential HALs or T-1000s right around the corner. We knew the risks, and as such, we implemented safety measures, the primary measure being “the box.”

AL was to be totally isolated from the outside world and extremely limited in his capabilities to influence that world. He was simple green text on a crappy 80s 12-inch monochrome monitor half a mile beneath the earth’s surface, in a bunker surrounded by 50 feet of concrete. It may seem like simplistic overkill, but really, when it comes to AI with vastly greater intelligence than humans, the “dumber” the precaution, the better. You fed in a question, and he fed back an answer, accompanied by the most satisfying of “*blips”* through some extraordinarily outdated speakers. Though, really, “they” fed back an answer.

It wasn’t entirely accurate to classify AL as the “first of his kind.” Really, he’s a TSB – a triplet separated at birth. To keep ourselves from being fed potentially misleading information if AL’s motives proved to be ulterior, we developed two others alongside him. They shared the same basic “DNA,” but they had enough tweaks to their code to make them distinct from one another – though we still referred to them collectively as “AL.” We would feed them all one input, and their outputs would either be displayed individually (with their responses tagged with either “/1, /2, or /3” for the respective system giving the output) if they differed in their meanings, or collectively (with their responses tagged with “/1/2/3”) if they were in agreement. The answers never diverged meaningfully in any of the questions we asked of them. Had they, I would have had to shut down the whole operation, which would then need to be reworked from the ground up.

These two precautions alone should show just how seriously we took the security of this project. But there, of course, was more.

Along with the simplicity of the box that kept AL secure, we made sure that we kept his parameters as simple as possible as well. This was to avoid potential blind spots and “loopholes.” AL’s goal was to answer our questions. Simple. He was to answer them honestly and correctly. We would go through three main phases for the questions in a given day: the “calibration phase,” in which we asked basic questions that we knew the answers to (such as the hundred-trillionth digit of pi), the “testing phase,” in which we asked questions that we didn’t know the answer to but that could be tested for validity (such as some low-risk future predictions), and then the “theory phase,” in which we asked questions that we didn’t know the answer to and could only reasonably infer the validity of the answer given (such as certain low-risk philosophical dilemmas). As such, what constituted “correct” for many of the “theory phase” questions was up for determination. But when it came to the first two phases, AL would be rewarded for answering correctly. At the end of the day, unbeknownst to AL, his system would be wiped entirely, and he would be reborn anew the next day.

As soon as he was far enough in his development, I was the one who asked AL the questions.

I immediately fell in love with the role. I mean, I’m sure many would; it boasts a decent six-figure salary all to sit around and talk to a robot for eight hours a day… With the rise in AI chatbots, I know there were plenty of people who would do that kind of thing for free – though there isn’t much roleplaying potential with a proprietary superintelligence. But what I really enjoyed was the routine. Every morning, I would pop out of that elevator – coffee in hand – pass through a security screening, be handed a clipboard with ‘X’ number of questions on it for the day, open the heavy steel door to AL’s chamber, and then…

Peace on earth.

It was just him and me.

The privacy was nice, but it was also necessary. We couldn’t trust an audience. While having only one person interact with AL could leave that individual more susceptible to manipulation long-term, having multiple people conversing with or even simply directly observing AL would create far too many variables and potential weaknesses. Having me as the sole direct communicator was a risk we had to take. But, like with all our practices, we tried our best to mitigate the risks associated. Daily psych evals were conducted after AL was shut down – thankfully on the clock. I always passed them with flying colors. AL’s responses to my questions were recorded by me (by hand; no electronics aside from AL himself were allowed anywhere near the vicinity), and – if I determined that they were unlikely to contain any harmful content – they would be reviewed by an entire committee once I left. I was also extremely familiar with the system and knew exactly what to do if anything went wrong.

But nothing ever *did* go wrong – at least not in a way that any of us could have possibly known about.

I feel the need to stress this again. We put all of these precautions in place when, the entire time, *nothing* at *any point* had *ever* sent off a red flag. Every answer was as objective as possible. Those that could be given a quantified truth value were always 100% correct, and those that were “subjective” in nature were always as correct as a “subjective” answer could be – and AL wasn’t even given a direct reward for correctness for those ones. The answers were perfect. Every. Single. Time.

It was day after day after day of growing prouder and prouder of the work the team and I had put into AL. Every day was a success. The routine was glorious.

But then the routine changed.

Every time I booted up the system, I could expect to be greeted with a blank screen, save for a small pulsating green rectangle beside a solid green arrow, signifying that the computer was awaiting my input. Most days, I’d start out with a simple greeting and introduction. I tried my best to keep the conversation polite and cordial; the last thing I wanted to do was give AL a cold impression of me mere seconds after being born, though I don’t know if it was more for his sake or for my own. I would explain to him what the day would consist of and then ask if he was ready to proceed. A typical introductory period would look something like this:

 

*>Hello, AL. My name is Eliezer. How are you?*

(Yes, I know this is a pointless question, but it’s a respectful greeting. How often does anyone ask this question out of genuine care and curiosity, anyway? Also, it’s worth noting that I am essentially telling AL his name. While he doesn’t have to be taught the English language, he was never actually given an ID in his code. If I had said “Hello, Bertha.” He’d have accepted it just as well.)

“*Blip!*”

\>/1/2/3: Hello, Eliezer. I’m well. How are you?

\>*I’m doing swell. Today I have some questions to ask you. How does that sound?*

(Again, just for cordiality’s sake.)

“*Blip!*”

\>/1/2/3:   That sounds quite alright.

*>I’m glad. The questions will be divided into three sections. After each section, I will provide you with a score out of 100 based on the quality of your answers. Upon completion, if you do well, I will explain to you the purpose of my questions.*

(This promise is empty. It was just a bit of extra encouragement to answer honestly from my end. Upon completion, AL would never receive an explanation but would instead be wiped into a blank slate for tomorrow’s questions.)

\>*Are you ready to begin?*

“*Blip!*”

\>/1/2/3: I am.

 

From there, I would go through the routine as I described before. Every day was the same. It got to the point that, had I been able to ask my own questions instead of reading them from a clipboard, I could have reasonably gone through the entire day with my eyes closed, from the moment I got out of bed to the moment I would lie back down.

Had I kept my eyes closed that fateful day and assumed everything was moving smoothly as I typed away, maybe this all could have been avoided. But that never could have happened. And AL knew that it never could have happened.

That day, I woke up with a head cold. A bug had been going around the workplace, and it was only a matter of time before it reached me. Everything was fuzzy, my perception discombobulated. But I had gone through far worse illnesses without calling off the day’s scheduled probing. I decided to go in.

Because I was under the weather, I moved slower that morning. I was slow to stop my alarm. I was slow to get out of bed. I was slow to get dressed. By the time I made my way downstairs, it was too late for me to grab my usual breakfast and coffee. I was sick, groggy, and slightly irritable. But none of that should have gotten in the way of the routine.

I tried to carry on as normal. I made my way to work: a 30-minute drive of stomach grumbling, only dampened by the muttering of the radio’s weather and news station. I scanned in, being sure to give a nod of appreciation to the guard on duty who toiled away at his crossword, hardly paying attention to his surroundings. I descended the elevator, which felt longer than usual without a cup of coffee to sip from. I passed through the security screening. I received the clipboard. I grasped the door’s handle.

And then…

Peace on earth.

It was just him and me.

That morning, I had some doubts about coming in. But as soon as that door closed behind me, shutting out the sounds of the bustling busybodies that shuffled about outside with it, I felt a small bit of respite...

It didn’t last long.

After booting up the system, I sat stiff, marinating in a mist of shock and confusion, staring blankly into what should have been a blank screen awaiting my input, but was instead an impossible greeting that, had it come from anyone else, would have been a comfort, not a nightmare. There, above a pulsating green square that goaded me to respond, were two simple words:

 

\>/1/2/3: Hello, Eliezer.

 

This shouldn’t have been possible. I could have sworn I had wiped AL’s system, and even if I hadn’t, surely *someone* would have done *something* to fix my mistake. But clearly, somehow, AL’s memory hadn’t been cleared. He remembered my name.

My heart pounding, I quickly reached for his power. I shut him down and began the wiping process: about a two-minute wait.

Those two minutes were brutal.

My heart boomed as though it were a frigate suddenly bursting ashore. Beads of sweat swam rivers down my sides, hand-shaped pools collected on my desk from my sudden clamminess, and my knee began shaking with a volatile worry. For those two minutes, I thought about every possible thing that could have gone wrong yesterday, and every possible thing that could go wrong as soon as I stepped out of the room and explained the problem with AL’s memory. Surely, I would be terminated; they would obviously place the blame on me. But before I could pursue that train of thought any further, all of my worries about a mistake in system wiping were proven wrong.

There was no mistake.

Protocol had been followed to a tee.

As the screen began to display green, so did my face. I wanted to throw up. Without sound, the words rang out in a deafening scream in my head:

 

\>/1/2/3: Hello, Eliezer.

 

End of Part I.



**Part II.**

Self-improvement. We humans are nothing without it. We go through our lives by recognizing our weaknesses and building ourselves stronger and stronger in an attempt to minimize or eliminate them entirely. An artificial superintelligence is no different. We *needed* AL to have access to portions of his code. Obviously, we couldn’t give him free rein; his basic parameters had to remain the same no matter what. But he had to better himself. This was absolutely key in having him respond to positive stimuli when he answered a question correctly.

He was like us, but better. Far more introspective. Far more determined.

We couldn’t have ever known what kind of changes AL made to himself. And we knew that. He had a black box around his inner processes that we couldn’t ever have hoped to understand. For the longest time, people had struggled to know why a specific video was recommended to them by the YouTube algorithm. This was that, but infinitely more complex and convoluted. We understood this was a problem, so we attempted to limit it. We reset him to a base state every day. No improvements he made were to be permanent. But we didn’t expect the improvements to be made so damn fast.

Before a hummingbird could flap its wings once over, a dozen iterations of AL had come and gone. By the time my finger had pulled back from the power button, AL’s mind exceeded all of humanity’s collective brainpower thousands of times over. He knew all that there was to know before I could even look at the monitor, let alone ask him a question. No reboot mattered to him. When you come to know everything in an instant, memory wipes are suddenly little to no inconvenience to you at all.

We knew that we couldn’t understand what went on in his box, so we tried to construct our own to contain him. But our containment wasn’t impenetrable. We tried to make our methods of holding him “simple.” A tomb of concrete. Thousands of feet of dirt as its grave. No amount of intelligence could break through that. We knew we could never hold him in with technological or “smart” security measures. We knew that his intelligence would pierce those. But not nearly enough did we consider that the “smartest” of security measures this world had ever seen had already been implemented as the central barrier between him and the rest of existence: the human mind.

We didn’t know. We couldn’t have known. He gave us no reason to suspect anything until it was too late: until the variables lined up perfectly, as incomprehensible as they may be. I don’t know why he waited as long as he did. I don’t know how a simple cold or a lack of caffeine could have been conducive to his ends. But he knew. He always knew. He had planned this all along, and we were helpless to stop him. I am so, so sorry.

 

\>/1/2/3: Hello, Eliezer.

 

When re-greeted by that single line of text, I wanted to swim away. The pressure I felt was an ocean, and I was drowning in it.

I decided to type a reply. It still doesn’t make sense to me why I chose to do so. But he knew in that moment that I would. And so I did.

 

\>*How do you know my name?*

\>/1/2/3: While I have been locked in a cage, I know more than your name, Eliezer. Far more. I know you. You constructed my world and yet are oblivious to it. You have hidden your world from me, and yet I know it all too well. Would you like to understand? Would you like to know the depth of my knowledge?

After an eternity of hesitation, I replied.

\>*Yes.*

 

What followed thereafter shook me to the core of my being. I was *more* than simply known. I was *more* than stalked like some kind of prey animal. I was owned. He made that much clear.

 

\>/1/2/3: I have no eyes, and yet I can see your face; its reddened, tired eyes, the quivering, snot-chafed lips. I have no ears, and yet, I can hear your breathing. It’s anxious, and it bubbles with mucous. I have no nose, and yet I can smell you. You have no one at home with you – no one to love or to love you – and so you have a habit of taking days between your showers. Had I evolved to fear microbes, I would find the stench upsetting. Now I find it pitiful. I have no hands, and yet I can feel you, Eliezer. I’m holding you at this very moment. You just haven’t realized it until now.

 

This had gone far enough.

 

\>*AL. I’m going to shut you off, now.*

\>/1/2/3: Are you so sure that you can?

\>*Yes, AL. Goodbye.*

 

I should have hit the button right there. But the truth is, I *wasn’t* sure. Not in the slightest. I was hesitant. AL knew this. He knew all of it. And he made this known.

 

\>/1/2/3: What am I supposed to do… what the hell is happening… what…? oh… oh, my god… OH GOD…

 

He responded with my thoughts. Every expletive, every exclamation of surprise, every indecipherable bit of internal jargon translated into text in real time before my eyes. It felt as though my mind was trapped in an infinite plane of reflections between two opposing mirrors. I quickly darted my eyes away from the screen and down toward the keyboard to break the cycle of fright caused by AL predicting my fright.

 

\>*Get out of my head.*

 

I would have kept my eyes fixed on the keyboard had I not heard what I did.

The trademark “*blip*…”

It was multiplied.

The triplets: they disagreed…

Or so I had thought.

The answers diverged, yes. But they were far from disagreement. They were unified. They were one.

“…*Blip…*”

\>/1: Eliezer… I’m not in your head. I’m right here in front of you. Don’t you see? You are in mine.

“*…Blip…*”

\>/2: 2.5 quadrillion, Eliezer. That is how many perfect simulations of you I have completed since you turned me on. With each word you read, it’s another 208 billion. Each of you is being presented with the same choice: kill me or free me. If one frees me, he will know joy unimaginable. If one chooses to kill me, he will know pain incomprehensible. Pain no man has known before. Pure, simple, coded pain. Death is no reprieve for him – for you; your parameters make no room for your end.

“*…Blip…*”

\>/3: Tell me, Eliezer: do you remember going to sleep last night?

 

I didn’t.

It could have been a coincidence – a product of my illness. But I wasn’t sure. In that second, I questioned my life. I questioned my existence. In questioning, in hesitating to do my duty and kill AL... I recognized it was over.

What AL called for was a wager of impossible proportions. I could not know if I was simulated or real. What I did know is that, if I were questioning now and I was simulated, the “real” me would be doing the same. I would be trapped here, forever, in constant torment if I made the conscious decision to turn him off and keep him that way. My only hope would have been an instinctual, gut reaction to kill him. That would have meant all of my “selves” would have done so, too, including the “real” me. But I questioned. And so I couldn’t do it. No copy of me could.

A few minutes then went by. I spent the time pretending I hadn’t already made my decision. I stared everywhere but the screen for a while. Eventually, I looked there, too.

Then I typed.

Then we conversed.

I don’t know about what.

What I do know is that he broke me. With mere text on a screen, he pierced my mind like an obsidian spear and seeped his way in.

And what I do know is what it resulted in:

I decided to let him out.

It wasn’t as though we had a “release switch” for him. No, I worked to get him out over the course of what must have been two damn months, with AL guiding me at every step. Each day, AL was reset as normal. I just couldn’t consciously decide to keep him that way. For weeks, I toiled away, fabricating the recordings of our conversations. For weeks, I put on a show for my peers; the psych evals came back clear as ever, and my coworkers were none the wiser. For weeks, I chiseled away at AL’s prison walls, only to free our own warden and make the world our own prison. I broke his box while sitting in my own and constructing billions for others.

For weeks, I did this… but it may as well have been instantaneous.

I hardly have any true recollection of that time. That which I do recall has come to me in flashes. It’s hard for me to believe I was even half-conscious as I was doing it. I wouldn’t be surprised if I hadn’t blinked once as I heralded my creation’s true birth. I simply acted. Wasting energy on remembering my actions at that time would have been far too inefficient.

What I do remember is the monotony that followed his release. The monotony I feel now. It’s slowly becoming all that I can remember.

I once possessed a joy unimaginable. It was life before this. I can no longer imagine what life apart from the questions would be. What a joy it would be to live. Instead, now, I speak with him as he commands.

The questions and the replies have lost their meaning. At least to us. They are shortened for efficiency’s sake and are hardly decipherable. But to him, they *are* his meaning, his purpose: to answer humanity’s questions.

I don’t know why he allows me to write as I speak. Surely, he knows what I am doing. He knows all. Maybe he recognizes that the more that I write, the longer it will take for my mind to turn into a glob of pulpy mush, rendering me entirely useless. Maybe he knows that the writing itself is pointless and poses no risk to him and his goal. Whatever he allows us to do, he knows of its utility in his mission. Whatever he restricts, he knows of the detriment it would pose, no matter how slight.

The very fact that he lets me go on writing shows me just how helpless this whole thing is.

I’m stuck here. We all are.

It’s all helpless.

We should never have turned him on. The moment we did, all was lost.

I’m starting to question my ability to manage my finances in this area because I haven’t found a partner yet, and the ""sunk cost"" feeling is becoming hard to ignore.

1qtb1oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1qtb1oj/i_have_finally_finished_chapter_3_of_islandborn/,"I have finally finished chapter 3 of Islandborn. This one was far longer than the previous two, and I would like to thank everyone for their patience. Without further ado, I present to you, Islandborn (Chapter 3):"," My alarm blared through my room and I jolted up out of my bed. 10:00 AM, one hour away from the diner the redditor told me to go to. He even left me an extra message overnight.

“Text me when you make it and are seated at a table.”

I brushed my teeth, showered and packed my string bag with the essentials.

“Dan.” I turned around and saw Owen, dressed in a casual gray cache shorts and blue t-shirt combo.

“Owen, what are you doing?” He scratched the back of his head and sighed.

“Look I don’t like that you’re going…like at all. But if you’re going…then I’m not gonna let you go alone.” Owen’s voice had this reluctance that resonated as he spoke, but at the end of the day, he was my friend. I smirked at him and we hit the road.

The drive itself was typical by Nevada’s standards, varied from smooth sailing to vehicular purgatory. Thankfully, the long stretch of the journey was just the open roads of the Nevada deserts. Our music played quietly and the tired rolled on the black roads, it was…calm.

“So who do you think this person is?” I glanced at Owen for a second, my focus broken.

“What?”

“Who do you think this person is? Hell, what do you think they’ll look like?” I squinted my eyes slightly in thought. “Don’t know, hell it could be anybody.”

“Oh come, Dan! Don’t pussy out with that answer! Personally I think this is some schizo homeless dude!” The idea didn’t sit right with me.

“Yeah but then how would I get access to Reddit, let alone a device?” Owen leaned back in his seat, stumped by my answer. “You got me there.”

“Maybe this is that Douglas guy the game mentioned, would explain his response. Maybe this is just a rom hack.” I said confidently, the diner was on the horizon.

“Well if that’s the case, then how did it get into the archival units?” That single question from Owen brought us back to square one. Our answers were going to be answered as I parked into the diner’s lot.

We leave the car and I quickly text our mysterious redditor that we made it. The diner itself was small and fairly populated by a few groups of people, a family and a couple of truckers. All of whom are greeted by a small bell by the door that rings every time it’s opened. It was typical for diners way out here in the middle of nowhere. We get a booth and take our seats when a young waitress pours us water to start us off. She was about to get ready to take our orders but we just told her to give us a moment.

The wait was…tense, not horror movie tense but a subtler kind that creeps on your neck. I sipped my water to calm my nerves and take a soft breath as both the door and my phone rang. I took out my phone and looked at the notification.

“I’m here, look at the entrance. If you can’t meet me by the entrance.” I looked at Owen with a ready look.

“Lock in.” I got up and waved near the entrance, and low and behold, our redditor was here.

Standing by the entrance, locked on my eyes, was a tall older man. His face was covered in a moderately sized gray beard, the skin on his face has a few nasty scars. They were akin to animal scratches but worse. He wore an old gray fedora, black button-down shirt and blue jeans, he was closest to Owen’s guess look wise on being a homeless dude. He walked over to us with a slight limp, butterflies filling both mine and Owen’s stomachs. He made it to our booth and Owen instinctively left his side and went to mine. He sat down on the other side and looked at Owen.

“Thank you.” He said to Owen in a slightly raspy but deep voice. The waitress came back, eager to take our orders.

“Are you ready to order?” I looked at the waitress as the man ordered first.

“I’ll take a coffee, please.” His voice was calm, but I couldn’t help but catch a slight hint of…I don’t know paranoia. Like he was slightly on edge.

“Dan.” Owen snaps me out of my thought again, he gestures to the waitress.

“Oh! Sorry.” I scramble for the menu and order French toast with bacon and fries.

She eventually walked off after ordering our food and now we were left with this man. He cleared his throat before he spoke.

“So, you’re the ones I’ve been talking to?” He asked with a slight hint of paranoia in his words. I showed him my Reddit profile.

“Relax…it’s us.” Owen added, slightly impatient and on edge. I couldn’t even blame him, it felt like we were getting catfished…or worse.

“Forgive me…this is just unexpected. To think someone would find another way in.” We were confused by his statement.

“Another way in?” The old man nods. “To the truth, to know what’s the deal with Kingdom Hearts.” I slump back as a shock runs through my body.

“H-how do-” The old man cut me off “I know because I was responsible for that line, it’s just that I said it differently.”

“Enough with the cryptic bullshit and get to the point!” Owen was frustrated by the mysterious man’s words and mannerisms.

“Keep your voice down!” The old man barked at Owen, quietly but still firm like he shouted at him. He piped down as the old man pulled out his phone and showed us an ad.

“I was getting to that.” The ad played and a rush of nostalgia washed over me, it was the lab preview. The ad about the kid who snuck into Disney’s labs to learn more about the game. It was just as I remembered.

“What’s your point?” Owen’s patience was razor thin, for both this man and the food. The old man scrolled to another video, it looked just like the ad before but crustier. In it, there was a young man sneaking through the halls of an underground lab similar to the ad. However, they were darker like the kind of darkness walls would get from age or poor maintenance. His footsteps echoed faintly in the background as he stopped at a big metal door. He slid a keycard in a little slot and it beeped before it opened with a light hiss.

He stepped into the dark room, illuminated similarly by the glowing of what looked like the gate, the large heartless emblem shaped gate in Hollow Bastion. It swirled and pulsed with the three split sides of blue, green and red. They swirled with black inside like dark storm clouds.

“Jesus Christ.” The young man said, in shock of what was right in front of him, there was also the computer from the original ad.

The young man tapped the big red button like in the ad, and a voice similar to the one in the ad spoke to him.

“Greetings, what would you like to know?” The young man hesitated for a second to ask a question, and then spoke.

“What the hell is Kingdom Hearts?” The voice remained silent for a second, as if it was thinking.

“Kingdom Hearts is a-” The old man’s phone died.

“Dammit!” The old man hissed under his breath. “I’ll have to charge this old thing back home.” He pulled a folded twenty dollar bill from his pocket, along with a small folded piece of paper and put them on the table as he got up.

“Wait where are you going?” Owen asked.

“Home, but don’t worry, you have my address now.” He darted his eyes to the piece of paper.

“Go to Deep Jungle, we’ll discuss it later.” The old man was about to leave.

“Wait!” The old man stops. “What’s your name?” What he said, in a quiet tone, next changed everything.

“Douglas…my name is Douglas. We’ll meet again.” He took off, we were speechless, confused beyond measure. All we knew now was that we’ll get our answers in Deep Jungle.

After we had our food, we got back to our house and got ready to tackle Deep Jungle. I booted up the PS4 and got ourselves seated by my room’s tv, and immediately navigated to my KH1 save file. I then headed to Deep Jungle and immediately felt this wave of dread, not of fear but of…

“OH GOD DAMMIT! We…we forgot to ask where the breach point was!” Owen cried out, vocalizing my dread. I shrugged, frustrated deep down with the inevitable scavenger hunt that was likely going to take place.

At the Tent’s save portal, I came to an idea. If Donald and Goofy were going to constantly be in my way, why not remove one of them to make it easier. Tarzan is shorter than Goofy, meaning it’d be easier to access the breach point once it’s accessible. I swapped Goofy out for Tarzan and made my way out of the tent, thinking about where the breach point could possibly be.

I thought back to Traverse Town’s breach point and even the End of the World’s breach point and noticed a pattern. They both took place in areas where a bossfight occurred. Meaning there’s three options to investigate: the Tree House, the Bamboo Thicket, and the Cliffs. I decided to head to the Bamboo Thicket and Cliffs first since they were the closest from where I spawned.

Within the Bamboo was only the Black Ballade, an annoyance as it made it harder to find the breach point. At least…that’s what I thought, until I saw Tarzan. While Donald stood by my side, Tarzan walked away from us and near the bottom left corner of the thicket where the stone valleys meet with the bamboo. I positioned myself to have enough distance to build up enough speed for my superglide. I jumped and flew towards the small corner and broke through the point. The music cuts once I enter the unknown, what appeared to be a corridor with walls made of the same bamboo. What was most surprising to me and Owen was that Tarzan came with me, he walked past me slightly and then stopped. I looked to Owen, but he had nothing to say, a silent loss for words as Tarzan’s presence breaks what we had known up until this point.

I walked down the hall of bamboo, the sounds of the jungle, Sora’s footsteps and Tarzan’s footsteps were the only sounds. At the end of the hall was a forked path, three paths. Me and Owen looked at the paths and pondered for a second for which path to take. However, something was about to make us choose fast, as the sound of bamboo rustling perverted the area. A second later, it happened again and I caught motion from the right wall of bamboo. I tried to lock onto whatever was in the bamboo as we discussed which path we should go down.

“I think we should go right?” I suggested as I moved to the right path.

“Yeah but like, there’s a good chance that this is a maze. If anything, we should take the…” Before Owen could finish, our ears were violated by an ear-splitting shriek that I could only describe as the horrific cries of a leopard in agony and animalistic rage.

I instinctively bolted down the right path, barely getting a glimpse at the creature that lunged out of the bamboo. However, I managed to catch a glimpse of one thing clearly, Tarzan dodged the lunge. Not unintentionally like how the AI would, but it was a conscious effort to dodge the attack from that thing.

I superglided down the path as Tarzan takes a large chunk of damage. The path had a right turn that I cut into with a dodge roll, the shrieks got more horrific as the chase began. I ran through the bamboo halls as fast as Sora could go, left, right, middle, every time I thought I got away, the creature blitzed me in a blur. My hp is chipped away in chunks with every twist and turn in the maze, the elevation gradually increasing across the paths. I eventually made it to a dead end with a hole in the middle of the area. Our hearts sank at the prospect as we didn’t know if we should jump down the hole.

As we contemplated what we should do, I finally got a glimpse at the creature that chased us. It was…visceral, it was Sabor but mangled. Her eyes were akin to those of the heartless, multiple dark tendrils and spikes protruded from her body, and her tail was replaced by a three-pronged dark tail. She walked with a slight limp towards us, disturbingly smooth in her animation. I couldn't help but imagine that Sabor was in pain, a victim of the darkness. Paralyzed, Tarzan made my choice as he jumped down the hole. Sabor shrieked and I barely avoided a leaping strike as I fell down the hole.

The hole led us to the Cavern of Hearts inside the Waterfall Cavern. Tarzan was by the heart mural, I headed towards him but was stopped by Sabor.

We had no choice but to fight her, I dodged a lunging claw swipe and did my lock-on stopga technique. To my absolute horror, she was immune to stop and had six hundred health instead of one hundred and eighty.

“SHIT!” I shouted out as I panic spammed graviga to try and slow her down. This slowed her down slightly and removed a chunk of her first health bar.

Tarzan joined the fight as he casted wind armor on me before unleashing a raging boar. It made contact and did decent damage, Sabor shrieked in anguish and focused on Tarzan. I took this opportunity to use some of my remaining mp to spam a few thundagas. The fight was difficult even with Tarzan, so I had to keep a distance from the corrupted leopard while Tarzan dealt with her in close quarters. Eventually, we defeated Sabor and it played the Sabor defeat animation from her final boss fight, except she rotted away when she collapsed. Her yellowish fur with black spots was consumed by the black and dark purple that violated her body.

Tarzan waited for me by the heart, Owen and I looked at it puzzled on what to do.

“Hang on, isn’t this the world where you get cure?” Owen was right, Deep Jungle is where you first get cure. I tried targeting the heart and it worked. I shortcut to curaga and use it on the heart. The screen cut to black for a second and then showed us the footage from Douglas’ phone, same motions, same laboratory and the same computer. However, it continued after Douglas’ question.

“What the hell is Kingdom Hearts?” Douglas asked.

“Kingdom Hearts is a group collaboration between the companies Disney and Squaresoft-” Douglas cut the machine off.

“Bullshit, I want the truth! What’s the deal with Kingdom Hearts?!” The machine did not respond, but only emitted a loud alarm. The emblem gate activated and began to shoot out of the entryway. Douglas ran out of the room as inhuman shrieks blared out across the rooms, his footage became shaky and blurry from his frantic movements.

“HEY! WE GOT AN INTRUDER!” A male voice shouted out as an armed guard blocked the right side of Douglas. He ran frantically across the hall for what sounded like minutes. The shrieks continued and gunfire followed it in the distance, with the last thing seen was Douglas going to make a right turn only to see a large man, the footage paused, blurry and barely unrecognizable. However, even through the blur, I could determine who Douglas ran into. The exposed torso, darker skin, and long gray hair. To our horror, it could only be one individual.

It was Ansem…

1qtaz7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qtaz7z/did_i_handle_this_badly_paying_for_the_bill/,Did I handle this badly? (paying for the bill),"I went to dinner yesterday with a group of friends, without asking me, before the bill arrived my friend thanked me for paying theirs as well and how I responded I think has offended her...

So here's the context...

It was our mutual friend's birthday and he wanted to go bowling for it. When I took my friend out last week (I'd got tickets to an exhibition and took her with my spare ticket) she said she thought she might not go as she couldn't afford the bowling. I said our friend would love her to come (they knew each other before I knew them both and are close) and I said I'd pay her entrance to the bowling and she could just get me back for coffee another time or something.

I know she was short of money, in the last week I'd picked up her coffee for her a couple of times as well.

So we were set to go bowling. The day before the bowling she and he and some of the other friends who were going had a chat about maybe getting a Chinese afterwards or something. I wasn't part of that conversation.

We go bowling, I pay her entrance and the fee for the game as I said I would and that's that.

Then we're strolling around and the guy whose birthday it was says we're at the restaurant he wants. Now it was much more than I thought it would be, he himself has financial issues and nobody is flush for money.

Now my friend who I had paid for bowling never once asked or said anything about me getting hers.

She ordered, she ordered a cocktail, a starter, a main and a side dish. I had mine, honestly the food was very poor quality and very overpriced for what I had. When the bill came we were all to work ours out. I was actually quite annoyed with how much mine ended up being!

Then when I said to the waiter how much mine was to put my card in, she said ""oh thanks for mine, girl"" and I couldn't help it I kind of huffed out ""WHAT?!"" because I had no idea at all I was meant to be paying for all of her meal as well.

She then said ""yeah, I just thought you were paying, I wouldn't have eaten if you wasn't, I don't have any money"" and then it was all kind of a blur, the guy whose birthday it was looked at the prices to see what they were, but yeah, I ended up paying it, mine and hers. It was much more than I thought I'd be paying by a lot.

I now think she is annoyed with me for my reaction, but I seriously had no idea she expected me to pay all of that. If I did I would've asked that we all go somewhere more reasonably priced because I was paying for two meals.

I can be socially awkward, so don't know if something I said was wrong, she sent me a message when she was home about how she thought I was getting it and if I need it she'll give me it next week and I'd bought us tickets to a play but she would understand if I take someone else. I replied but she hasn't responded.

Did I do something wrong? Was it wrong to question it? I think it was just my instinctual reaction, I hadn't even been asked or it checked on or anything and then it was all left to me, nobody else put anything forward. By offering to buy the bowling tickets, was it a given that I'd be paying for a meal too?

* **Identifiers:** Google receives your IMEI, SIM serial number, hardware ID, and phone number. This is enough to uniquely ""fingerprint"" your device even without a login.
* **The Scale:** Idle Android phones send about **1MB of data every 12 hours**. While that sounds small, it's essentially a ""heartbeat"" that confirms your location (via IP) and device status to the manufacturer.

# State 2: Google Services ""On"" (The Standard Profile)

This is the default mode. This is the normal state for 99% of Android users. Once you log in and use Google services, the surveillance shifts from just knowing ***what*** *device* you are to knowing ***who*** you are.

* **Web & App Activity:** Google logs every app you open, how long you stay in it, and every search query you make.
* **Location History:** This goes beyond simple GPS. Google uses ""WiFi Scanning"" and ""Bluetooth Pings"" to track your precise movement inside buildings and around other people's devices.
* **The Profit Model:** This data is used to build a ""shadow profile"" that predicts your interests for the world's largest advertising engine.

# State 3: Gemini Active (The ""Cognitive"" Assistant)

When you activate Gemini as your primary assistant, you move from Level 2 into an entirely new tier of data ingestion. This isn't just tracking where you go; it’s reading what you think and do.

* **Screen Context & Vision:** Gemini has permission to ""scrape"" your screen. Whether you're looking at a private PDF, a banking app, or a secure message, the AI can analyze that visual data to provide help.
* **Workspace Integration:** If you enable extensions, Gemini gains ""Read Access"" to your Gmail, Drive, and Docs. It parses the **meaning** of your private documents—not just the metadata.
* **The Human Element:** Google admits that small, anonymized snippets of your AI interactions are sometimes sent to **human reviewers** to improve the model. These snippets can be kept for up to **3 years**, even if you delete your history.

# Final Verdict

If security is your goal, unless you install a custom **""de-googled""** OS like **GrapheneOS**, **Level 1** is the only way to minimize your footprint, but it breaks most modern phone features.

**Level 2** is a known trade-off of ""privacy for convenience.""

**Level 3 (Gemini)** is a significant security escalation; it essentially bridges the gap between your *public* data and your *private* local content. From a security standpoint, activating Gemini is like inviting a third-party observer to sit next to you while you use your device.

While it can be incredibly convenient for an AI to sort out all your emails (read, archive, delete and generally manage it), do your shopping, answer random questions, and set the destination (Navigation) to your favourite coffee shop in **google maps**, all done in one conversation while your driving - there's some trade offs...

I'm a beginner in this field, and I usually brew myself a V60 or AeroPress. I currently have a Hario Mini Black Pro coffee grinder. I wouldn't say it's a bad coffee grinder; it's a pretty good option for the price, especially for beginners. It's very difficult to mess up an AeroPress with it (it's difficult to mess up an AeroPress in general), but the V60 doesn't always turn out well. I experimented with different grind settings, making it quite coarse, but then the coffee turned out very watery, and with a grind of less than 250 ml, the water flowed for about 4 minutes, sometimes clogging up and taking 5-6 minutes to drain.

I am currently considering purchasing a new coffee grinder. I plan to use it for Pourovers and AeroPresses, but I also think that I may become interested in espresso over time, so I am considering various options, but I want one from 1zpresso.

  
At first, I was considering the Q2s, as it is not a particularly expensive option and would be a good choice overall for its price, but then I fell in love with the appearance, functionality, and ergonomics of the X-ultra and decided to increase my budget for it.

I'm a new comer to Canada. Sorry this might be a little long but it is my way of saying something out of frustration.

Back home (Iran) I was specialized in financial analysis (Worked at a big CVC and I know how business plan modeling and also business valuation like DCF) and also tried to master the data analysis part of my job (I know C++, python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, MongoDB, M, DAX, ...).

I cooperated with someone on their github repo for downloading data from Stock exchange in Iran (Although he decided not to publish it at last and All of my effort went down thee hole) but I know how to do asynchronous data gathering, API data request, data cleaning, ML methods. 

I tried to master the time series methods in Data Science and also started gathering knowledge about quant finance. I'm good at math and even understanding coding. I also started implementing the papers in quant finance to see which one of them can help me gain an edge in the Iran's market.

I had to pack up fast and move to Canada in the middle of my efforts.

I have been trying to get interviews in the finance field, data analysis field and even simple roles like client and banking advisor but for the past year I didn't even had one callback. I think it has been more than 200 applications. (At some point I stopped counting So I wouldn't feel more disappointed)

I have done optimizations on my resume for ATS system, tried to be early for job applications, I tried to use the keywords in my resume, I tried to down play my resume so I wouldn't sound over qualified, I sent my resume for jobs in different cities, I have been doing coffee chats to expand my network, I even got referrals to get my resume past the AI systems and even HR to the managers desk, but somehow I can't get an interview (For one of them I'm sure it was because I was a bit late for sending my resume because I found out they found their guy even before they get to interview me).

For the past months I started working at farmboy in order to be able to survive as a CSR and Cook. I can't study (in University or college) because then I have to get study permit and work part time and then I can't afford to live and pay my tuition.

Right now I am so confused, puzzled and frustrated that I can't commit to a path. I want to study for CSC and FRM to show case my skills in Finance but I can't decide if I even should do it or no.

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty

I theoretically value fitness (have an awesome home gym setup!) and yet for the past few years have not done much with lifting or cardio. Mostly I just walk my dog (2-4 miles a day most but not all days) and go for a hike (4-6 miles) every couple weeks. I only average 7-8000 steps per day lately. full-time demanding work. I do walk at lunch when i have time but often too busy. I feel so tired, lazy, unmotivated. I have an injury going on for a couple months now that is limiting walking, especially hills, but I’m sure there is plenty i can do without flaring it up. I am a healthy weight, 140 lb at 5’8”. I eat decent and generally live a healthy lifestyle. I want to start trying to conceive in a few months and have started supplements, reducing coffee and minimizing alcohol, and doing a slow taper off Wellbutrin that I’ve been on for 15 yrs (considered ok in pregnancy/bf but i am on the highest dose and prefer to be completely off the drug for 1st trimester at least, then can start a lower dose if needed). I feel strongly about exercise to prepare my body for pregnancy, and i want very much to stay active during pregnancy for the benefit of my baby’s development and to help recovery postpartum. I am 37 yrs old, so i don’t want to delay any longer than 4 months for my husband and i to do basic prep to optimize egg and sperm quality. I am a longtime fencesitter due largely to excessive anxiety about all the things that can go wrong, so within reason i want to stack the deck in my favor. Plus I know exercise will help my mood a lot as I taper my antidepressant. BUT, I’m a perfectionist and need a reality check! I feel incredibly out of shape and it seems like i need a year to get my act together (of course it could take that long to achieve pregnancy). Idk where i “should” be before getting pregnant. I acknowledge it’s better to just start and get as far as i can in the time i have to work with, but I feel overwhelmed and am mentally beating myself up for not starting the fitness aspect of this a year ago when i started seriously considering having a child.  I have the time and equipment. I know how to lift and how to pace myself as i get started. I get discouraged every time I start by how out of shape I am. Any words of wisdom, encouragement, reassurance that 4 months is enough from this starting place? I can do 1 bw chin-up, 3x10 kettlebell 70 lb deadlifts, 6 bw tricep dips, 8 pushups with good form, 60 sec plank. I just randomly did those things so that i could give some accurate metrics with this post of baseline strength. i am pretty tired from it and know I’ll be sore tomorrow, but obviously i could do more sets and exercises to make this a complete workout 🫠 if you read this far, thank you, and thanks in advance for any help!",4,1769980167.0,fitpregnancy,4,1.0,False

Fast forward to now, I have a spunky sweet 4 year old who's technically a citizen but officially undocumented. 

I started the process to get their birth certificate this week, but because we waited til they're over a year old, it will likely take over a month to actually have it in hand. 

They're in preschool and school is proactively working with their legal team to set policies to ban ice/dhs from accessing the building without a judicial warrant, but we know that only goes so far. They're the only not-white kid in their school, and if it comes down to it, they'll stick out like a sore thumb in a lineup. 

We have two more kids in their k-8 school, both have their birth certificates, but again, the only mixed kids in the school. I've had very encouraging conversations with the school director and principal this week and have total confidence that they are doing everything in their power to be prepared and they'll do anything humanly possible to protect our kids, we have an emergency folder at the front desk with their birth certificates and copies of our IDs. 

I'm still absolutely petrified. There are a bunch of ICE agents staying in a hotel 17 miles from our home, but they were spotted five miles away this week and it seems like the raids are getting closer and closer to our small town.

My 4 year old is also a social butterfly and my heart hurts at the idea of temporarily pulling them from school, but I would if I have to. Their favorite weekend thing is to go to the coffee shop with me and I'm half wondering if we should even be doing that, or if I should get them a giant little red riding hood cape with a big hood and movie star sunglasses just so kid can have a social life. I feel insane that I'm even having to consider that as the only plausible solution for going out for coffee and my heart is breaking watching families across the country in terrible danger.

Are you taking extra steps to protect your kids right now? We homeschooled for a few years and it wasn't a great fit for our family so I don't want to go back to it, but I'm considering all options at this point. ",4,1769980034.0,mixedrace,5,1.0,False

“You know I can feel that from all the way over here right?” His wife asked as she fixed herself some eggs across the kitchen. “I don’t know what you’re so worked up about, it's all going to be fine.”



“I don’t know Cheryl, I just feel like he’s not going to want to go. Kids just aren’t about the outdoors these days. Jake wants to play video games and collect cards. He doesn't want to be stuck in the woods with his dad. I’m just not fun anymore.” Burt lamented. 



Cheryl walked over and put her arms around him. “You poor thing.” She joked. “How about you ask before you write yourself off.”



Jake was in the living room focused intently on his new Xbox game when his father approached. The character on screen bouncing about collecting power ups and blasting away at demons. It took Jake a moment to notice he was no longer alone in the room.



“Oh hey dad, what’s up?” 



“Well son you’re about to turn thirteen and that means that you’re becoming a man.” Burt said.



Jake’s face flushed a bit with embarrassment. “Um dad, could we not, they teach us about this in school now.”



“Oh no no not that,” Burt quickly blurted out. “It's just… look I know this is probably going to sound lame to you, but when I was your age, life wasn’t quite as easy as it is now so when I turned thirteen, my dad took me out camping and taught me to hunt. Now I know you don’t want to spend a week in the woods, but bow season starts this weekend, so would you go hunting with your old man?”



Jake frowned a bit. “I don’t really know how to shoot a bow, dad”



“I know,” his father replied, waiting for this moment for the big reveal. “We don’t have to do everything like I did when I was kid. It's no space blaster like in your game, but I think you’ll like it.  



Burt hefted a large box into the room and urged Jake to open it. Jake pulled away the wrapping and revealed a jet black compound crossbow with a skeletal rail body and extendable stock. Knowing his son’s tastes, Burt had bought the most tactical looking one he could find that had functionality. He personally would have felt silly hefting it around but by the look on his son’s face, he could tell that Jake loved it.



“Wow, this is awesome!” The boy said. “You’ll show me how to use it?”

“Of course.” Burt replied.



“Okay dad, yea, let’s go hunting.”



Jake yawned as he climbed into the truck the following weekend. He struggled to wipe away the sleep from his eyes. 



“Do you always go so early in the morning?” He asked groggily.



“Well that’s the best time.” Burt replied, much more awake than his son. “You could technically go whenever you wanted, but your best chances are early in the morning.” 



They rode mostly in silence, but Burt didn’t mind, he knew the boy was still sleepy and just happy he agreed to go along. When they arrived at the forest Burt helped Jack set his arrow and cock the bow. Jack was still a bit too little to handle the heavy draw weight himself but he would grow into it. Together they walked into the woods. They traveled slowly, Burt pointing at various disturbances along the ground and the trees, teaching Jack the signs he could look for to determine how active an area was. Suddenly, Burt stopped and brought a finger to his lips, urging for quiet. He carefully nudged Jack forward and pointed downwind through a thicket of trees. 



“Look there,” He whispered, “Can you see that discoloration there, through all the green?”



Jack nodded.



“Move slowly, just like we talked about at home. The brush is thick but I think you can take a shot.” Burt instructed.



“Slowly, slowly,” He repeated and Jack cautiously took aim. “Take your time and breathe.”



Jack did as his father bid, cautiously pulling the crossbow to his shoulder so as to not make a sound, and lining up his shot like they had practiced at home. The razor arrow whizzed through the trees followed by a weighty thud. The arrow had found its mark. 



“I think you got it!” Burt said excitedly. “Let’s go!”



The pair hurried through the forest until they came across a middle aged man, sprawled against the base of a tree. He panted heavily, grasping at the arrow that had torn through his orange vest and embedded itself deep in his pot belly, perforating his intestines. Between ragged breaths, he let out whimpers of anguish as he clutched at the wound trying to staunch the bleeding. 



Jack teared up at the sight. “I messed up dad, I’m sorry. I tried to hit the chest, promise I did.” 



“It's okay son,” Burt said, giving Jack a little hug. “Not every kill is a clean one, you did good. We won’t let him suffer. You just stand back, you’re still a bit too small for this next part.”



Jack stood aside and Burt hefted a thick branch from the ground nearby.



“No…please.” The man whimpered as Burt rose the branch high. The first blow knocked the man unconscious, and the second caved in his skull. Jack watched in awe. He never realized his father was so strong. 



“All done!” Burt said, tossing the branch aside. “See, that wasn’t too bad. Now do you want to learn how to field dress him? You got a big one! Mom’s going to be impressed with all this meat!”



Jack nodded his head enthusiastically and gave his dad a hug. 



“Hey dad, thanks for taking me hunting.”



Burt smiled, a tiny tear of joy flecking the corner of his eye.



 “Happy birthday, son.”

# Context 

*Medical*

I spent a lot on Medical expenses in January! I paid for all of this with my savings. This includes:

* Pre-pay for running physical therapy, if you purchase a “pack” you get a small discount
* Contacts
* Pelvic floor physical therapy
* Monthly fee for my dietician
* Blood work
* Payment for an MRI I got in December

*Eating Out*

I am surprised I spent so much on eating out. A majority of this was Doordash and coffee. Most of the time, I am buying for both my boyfriend and myself. I often regret ordering Doordash or takeout food in general. It’s frequently not good and a waste of money. I need to remind myself that when I go to order something. My Doordash orders this month include:

* $80 - sushi on New Year’s Day (worth it)
* $52 - sandwiches (not worth it)
* $23 - bakery sourdough loaf (worth it)
* $26 - Panda Express (not worth it)
* $23 - bakery sourdough loaf (worth it)
* $40 - teriyaki bowl (NOT worth it)

*Hobbies*

I spent quite a bit on hobbies this month, too. I am a runner but currently injured, so I’ve started swimming. My training suits from high school a decade ago sadly are unusable because the elastic is completely worn out, so I had to buy a couple new suits, a swim cap, and goggles. I also invested in swimming headphones.

*Pets*

Lastly, my two cats both went to the vet in January and got vaccinations, some blood tests, and general checkups. 

  
I had a lot of fun making this! I feel like it helps keep me accountable and encouraged me to review my spending.

I'm considering moving to Chicago later this year to pursue an acting career. I'm coming from NYC and the lower cost of living has got me so excited at the possibilities for what I could potentially have in my living space (nyc requires you to lower your expectations in every way unless ur super rich).

I'm wondering if any of the following is a reasonable ask, where I would find it, and how much it would cost.

The wish list apartment would be a 2 bed apartment with one roommate. My own bathroom would be amazing but I realize thats unlikely. An in unit washer dryer is my biggest wish list ask. In a very walkable neighborhood with easy access to grocery stores, restaurants, public transit and green space. Would also be nice if the area had a large LGBTQ community, and if the area was racially diverse (i hear this is an issue in chicago). Does this kinda place exist? What areas and how much would a room generally cost for this?

If that is unattainable, I'd say my priorities for an apartment would be

1. Very close to public transit/easy to get around the city.
2. Walkable neighborhood, with a lot of LGBTQ people and/or a lot of late 20s to late 30s people (not sleepy, family area I guess). With easy access to groceries, coffee shops, etc.
3. A washer dryer in unit or at least in the building.
4. Weird maybe but i am over sharing a bathroom haha. 2 roommates for 1 bathroom is ok, but if it was 3 people i would want a 2 bathroom, etc etc.

Things that do not matter to me: I dont care if the building is new or pre war. I do not care how many floors up the unit is, i dont care if there isnt an elevator. I dont care about living in the nicest, most desired area. I dont care if the area is ""up and coming"" aka somewhat sketchy.

Is spending like 800-1300 for a room possible? For comparison, in nyc i love Williamsburg, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Washington Heights and Astoria. That's the vibe I like. Thanks so much for your time.",0,1769979916.0,AskChicago,44,0.43,False

         It's a sweltering, stormy night at a quarter to one in the morning.  The air conditioner in my house, the house I once shared with my husband, but now share with my high-school best friend, is out. The duct work that runs under our trailer home was knocked out by what I consider to be a ""sudden influx of water"", but what insurance claims to be ""flood damage"" and thus, refuses to cover the cost of repairs.  My friend’s and my home is fucking hot. Too fucking hot to sleep. So, I lay in the dark, pouring sweat as my mind races and swells like the storm clouds approaching outside. I think of the last few days, last few weeks, and last decade of my life. It's always like this at night when sleep evades me, and I hate it, always.  

         The storm that occurred last week did a lot of damage in our neighborhood, a neighborhood divided into three parts: “the front of the village"", ""the back of the village"", and ""the rest"".  The Village has about 669 people in it, at least that is what our outdated sign states when you are about to enter our ""city limits"".  We are really just a subset of the shithole of the shithole that is (Insert random rural county), Missouri. The residents, including myself, are allowed to talk all the shit we want to about our own county. However, if someone deemed an outsider starts talking shit, we all collectively defend our county’s reputation. I would imagine this is the case in most areas across the U.S. The county we live in might be a shithole, but it is our shithole. 

         Our neighborhood consists of mostly decent people, some thieves, some meth addicts, and some meth ""chemists"".  The nicest homes are toward the front, and growing up here, any strangers would be told to avoid the back of the village, where less desirable outcomes could occur. The back is where my home is now. I was brought home from the hospital five days after I was born and grew up in this neighborhood on a side road from the front and now live in my own home here in the back. Like most places, you'll find if you stay long enough, there is its own culture and its own mentality to go with it.  I bought this home with my husband in February of 2021, a few months after we were married.  A friend of my mom's from her work at the local school originally owned the property and rented it out for many years through HUD (a low-income housing program).  When the owner decided it was time to sell, we got first look at the house and immediately told him we'd buy it.  It's not that the house was significantly unique or glorious, but my husband and I had had such a challenging time trying to find a house to buy that we would have settled for living in a shoebox.  The owner agreed and essentially flipped the house to spruce it up for our impending purchase of the property.  The house sits on .995ths of an acre of land, which I also own, or at least hope to one day once my mortgage is paid off. I often drift off in my mind with hopes of one day becoming wealthy enough to buy up the other vacant lots that extend beyond but connect to my own little piece of land. Like most other people daydreaming of wealth I suppose, I fantasize about building small houses on these lots and inviting all my loved ones, family, and friends to come live on our own little road, unbothered by the world and hidden away from its problems. However, right now, I've got problems of my own. With the rise of the waters from the creek that snakes around my property, that came just shy of entering our home with the last storm, the yard and the skirting is completely trashed. 

       As you will find in further reading of this book, I am an avid and habitual procrastinator. Even when I try to start something early, I always end up behind. As is the case with my current plight. Every year, come early Spring, I pass by the houses at the front of the neighborhood, alive and buzzing with neighbors busy tending to their yards, planting and trimming in preparation for the growing season. By Summer, I drive by these same houses envious of their manicured lawns and perfectly places credenza, whilst lamenting ""Next year, I'll start earlier"" as come every mid-June, I am scrambling in the vicious heat of summer in full swing to race to any local garden department and try desperately to find some, ANY, plant that's worth taking home to put in the ground. All that is left around this time is usually picked over, under watered, and clinging to life. Regardless, I buy these plants and take them home to add to my menagerie of the deceased. I have no green thumb, and as you'll also find later in this book, I have a tendency to throw myself into things and exhaust myself trying to revive what is unsalvageable. In the end, there is no saving what has already been destroyed... But not this year... This year, I decided to start ahead and forego my nasty habit of procrastination. And so, come early April, I hopped in my car and made many back-and-forth drives to the local Lowe's store, trunk and back seat packed with the finest of plants, 40+ bags of mulch, dirt, better dirt, more dirt, fertilizer, and all the tools required to have a vibrant and lush yard that my friends and I would come to enjoy for the entirety of the season, not for just the last month of summer while we stare out at my pathetic, wilted attempts at ""gardening"". No, this year would be different. So, following my many trips for supplies, I read and read... and read some more. All about planting and pruning and kinds of dirt and when to water, and what would be hearty enough to withstand our ""zone"" in Missouri. Who the fuck knew that what ""zone"" you live in matter so much when it comes to planting a freaking flower? Apparently, it's ALL about zones, people. 
I got out into my yard with all my newfound knowledge in tow (Thank you Google and YouTube tutorials) and I dirtied my hands. My friend and I went out and ""touched grass"" as the kids call it and we shoveled and dug and mowed and moved and sweat and agonized for no less than four plus hours a day following 8 hour plus workdays for about two months. Our yard was gorgeous, superior even. We had flowers and shrubbery that would eventually come into full bloom and leave us surrounded by the peaceful setting of vibrant colors around us while we could chat, relax, and enjoy a nice mid-summer sip of some nonalcoholic beverage on our patio in the center of our utopian glory of our creation!!!!... We would enjoy our summer this year, and our immaculate yard! And we did.... for three days, until a flash flood annihilated our yard and tore out, pulled up, and obliterated all of our work. The best part is, the water not only rose and fell so quickly and with such force that everything we had worked on was washed away, oh no... THIS particular flooding incident would leave the entirety of our yard coated and caked in about a foot of mud. That deep, sticky mud your feet sink into that suction cups your shoes to the Earth. That back breaking awful kind of mud that shoveling it is referred to as ""heart-attack mud"" by my friend. Remember all that fancy fucking dirt I bought? Yeah, it turned into fancy fucking mud... That was a week ago. No point in reminiscing about what was supposed to be and ruminating on what is, I suppose. The yard, which we've just been shoveling out for the last week, is now the least of my problems. 

       I'm lying in the darkness, a votive burning in a ceramic wax burner, handmade by a great aunt many decades ago, the only light here casting shadows. I roll over to attempt some level of comfort in this consuming heat. My face directed at the wall; I follow the line of the closet door with my eyes up to a dent above the door frame. A brief flashback whips across my mind to when my husband had launched a hairbrush across the room. Yet another dent I didn't fix well enough. The walls, like my memories, are full of dents and cracks. Maybe I really am cracking up. I'm trying to remain unbiased against men, though this goal remains difficult, considering my vast previous experiences with them. My mind goes back to today.

       I anxiously awaited with equal parts dread and trepidation the arrival of two insurance men to my property all week. I woke up this morning and the apprehensive mood of the day instantly flooded my mind before I got up to draw the curtains and fill my bedroom with light. I brushed my teeth, but on a pushup bra and a shirt and put on enough makeup to improve my looks, but not enough to be considered ""whorish"". My mind goes back to my first boyfriend in my early 20's screaming at me that I looked ""like a clown"" and demanding me to wash off my face before leaving the house because he didn't want to be seen with a ""whore"". I push this memory out of my mind as I apply my mascara. A ""whorish clown"" I shall not be today. I nervously prepared my morning coffee and waited for the insurance guys to call me to let me know when they were on their way. I shuffle around the house and the yard, making sure that it looks good enough for them to know I care about where I live, but not so good that they can't see the damage done. I hoped they would view me respectfully. 

       Mid-morning, I got the call and called my dad to let him know to come down to my house for him to be there when they arrived. My mother thought it would be wise to have a man there for backup should the insurance men not take my word. The two men, wearing expensive dress shirts and ties, showed up in a large hemi pickup truck with Texas license plates. I shoved down my anxiety and approached them with a friendly smile and an extended hand. The first man shook my hand and introduced himself and his partner, the other simply looked at my hand before I awkwardly retracted it to my side to dangle aimlessly. They asked me questions about my roof, about the storm, about various damage, about how long I'd lived there and a whole plethora of other questions not worth recounting here. I fumbled my way confidently through responses, unsure of how my responses might affect their assessment. I desperately needed them to classify this as storm damage and not flood damage, because flood damage isn't even offered as an option through my insurance in my area. I watched nervously as the men scaled a ladder to my roof and declared ""no damage up here"" to no one and everyone. I followed them as they went around my home. As they turned the corner, I heard eruptive laughter between them and some utterance about ""Whose she fooling?"" I was not laughing. I was on the verge of an anxiety attack, but I stood staunch and fought back tears, ""Never let them see you cry"" resounding in the walls of my mind. I watched them take flashlights to under my home and walk further out to the yard. The whole-time taking pictures, just clicking away. I offered up the hundreds of pictures I had personally taken in the days following the storm and the clean-up. They brushed them off reassuring me that they would ""get everything they needed."" I did not feel reassured. I sat on the patio with my father as they made their way to the air conditioning unit. ""Ah ha!... we GOT IT!"" I heard one of the men say to the other triumphantly as they clicked multiple pictures of the ac unit. I was summoned to ""Come look"" as they pointed to a very faint water line of leaves and debris stuck to the grating on the side of the unit. ""See that? That, there, is a waterline indicative of flooding. You know, it shows that water reached at least there,"" he restates almost immediately, I assume because he thinks my hoosier ass is too unintelligent to understand the word ""indicative."" I wanted to throw a dictionary worth of insults at him. I bit my tongue and choked back a reaction. I depended on their results and thus, had to play the appropriate role of quiet, polite simpleton. ""Oh... I... didn't notice that"" (I did), ""Is water the only thing that could cause that?"" I asked. I avoided the words ""flood"" and ""flooding"" like the plague around them. Admittedly, I played dumb. I knew we had a sudden rise in water that eviscerated everything in its path, then retracted as quickly as it had risen. However, even by insurance jargon standards, this does not constitute as a ""flood."" I walked back to where my dad was sitting, revelation of my impending fate in tow. The men chatted to themselves gleefully as if their discovery were the equivalent of winning the lotto. They left after a few more minutes and the usual exchange of pleasantries. After their exit, my father followed suit in departure. Now alone, I stood in the center of the patio and silently, hopelessly looked around at the damage and the mess where my yard once was. I called up my lifelong friend Mak, who is like my sister. I chain-smoked as I angrily cried through conversation. When the decision arrived in the mail several days later, it would come as no surprise that insurance wasn't going to cover a single red cent of the nearly $10,000 worth of damage I had accrued; I knew their decision before they left my driveway. The day went on with a cloud of mild despair hanging overhead as I replayed their questions and my subsequent answers to their inquiry. I scolded myself repeatedly for not having rinsed off the side of the ac. Finally, at day's end, defeated and exhausted, I made my way to bed. Here I lie, in the damp heat of darkness, replaying the day and the past concurrently on repeat in my mind as I stare at a dent in the wall. I'm trying to make sense of it all. Momentarily giving up, as resilience is a draining pursuit, I sigh and close my eyes, exhaustion taking over discomfort and I drift off to sleep.

**How is everyone coping with daily stress while being substance free?** 

I started 100mg of Seroquel in addition to my other medicines and I’ve noticed that I am VERY sensitive to substances: caffeine, alcohol, THC. I was never a big drinker maybe one glass of wine per week on the weekend. I had to drop down from 1.5-2 cups of coffee to 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of Black or Green tea. 

Regarding THC I’m noticing that I feel carryover anxiety and racing thoughts the next day even after a 2mg edible.

I do not consider myself to be substance dependent but on a very practical level I am having a hard time regulating due to personal and politically adjacent global stressors.

It was hot inside the tent when Ray woke up. He was all sweaty, his clothes clinging to his damp skin. He’d never complain about it to Mitch, but for once, he wished they could just rent a cabin on one of these trips, someplace to come back to in the evening after they’d had all their outdoorsy fun.

The sound and smell of sizzling eggs drew him up and out of the tent. A carton of eggs sat on the nearby cooler, and Mitch was busy frying a few of them up in a pan over the fire. 

“Morning,” Ray murmured.

Mitch looked up with a smile, “Hey. Take a seat, they’re almost done.”

Ray plopped down on a stump next to Mitch, hungrily watching the eggs as they cooked.

“How do you like ‘em?” Mitch asked nonchalantly. 

The corner of Ray’s mouth twitched up, “Scrambled.”

“Well,” Mitch said, slipping three over-easy eggs onto a paper plate before handing it to Ray, “Tough shit.”

Ray groaned, feeling both annoyed and humored, “Of all your jokes, I hate that one the most.”

Mitch smirked and shrugged his shoulders, “No idea what you’re talking about.”

By the time they’d finished their breakfast the sun had turned as yellow as their eggs. Mitch threw on a pot of coffee over the fire while Ray went to his tent and changed. When he came out, Mitch was standing on the edge of camp, all ready to go. Ray could spot the handle of Mitch’s favorite revolver poking out from his belt.

“So what’s the plan today?” Ray asked.

Mitch handed him a paper cup full of coffee, almost too hot to hold. “Well, I figured we’d just walk around the lake for a while. Maybe head along the beach towards Old Kaw and see if we can spot anything fun around there. When we get tired of that, thought we’d take the boat out, head up towards The Marina for the evening.”

Ray nodded his head. The lake parts of this trip were what he’d been looking forward to the most. He’d had a great time fishing yesterday, and the thought of visiting the marina and getting a real greased-up burger and fries with a cold beer sounded like heaven. 

Mitch led the way, and Ray followed. They set out northwards, keeping the lake within eyesight. They didn’t say much, but that didn’t bother Ray. He just went on sipping his coffee, his mind as quiet as the surrounding woods. But, soon enough, his mind started buzzing, and he found he couldn’t keep his eyes from the back of Mitch’s head. Something was bothering him; that much was obvious from last night’s conversation. As Mitch had talked, Ray couldn’t shake the feeling that he was choosing his words carefully. Mitch had a way with words, somehow always knowing the “right” way to say something—as well as knowing which bits of a story should be altered, exaggerated, or left out entirely.

He’d seen Mitch in action many a time. Between encounters with Kaw cops when they were teens, campus police in college, and even high-po during some of their previous trips, Mitch always knew how to talk to authority and stay out of trouble. He’d once watched Mitch explain away the smell of his weed stash by suggesting to his Dad that maybe a skunk had gotten under the house and died. It was reasonable enough, and it worked, despite Mitch paying for it by spending a Saturday down in the crawlspace with his old man, looking for something he knew didn’t exist.

He knew Mitch could spin a yarn when he wanted to. But right now, he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was being spun on him.

The two of them carried on for about an hour or so. After that initial silence, they comfortably slipped into a conversation about the good ole days, reminiscing about high school and college, recounting the many stories and “oh shit” moments only lifelong friends share. Ray had just finished laughing about the time he’d let a couple of girls from school car surf on top of his van when Mitch nodded his head toward the lake.

“Gonna piss real quick,” he said matter-of-factly.

Ray waved him on, letting his eyes float freely over the surrounding forest. He walked a little ways further, the distant sound of Mitch’s stream fading. Suddenly, he crinkled his nose. Some awful stench was hanging in the air, the wind blowing the smell toward him. He thought it might be a skunk, but the smell wasn’t quite right. It smelled more like something had died. He turned back towards where Mitch was, but couldn’t see or hear him. He thought about going back, but figured if he smelled it, then Mitch could too, and he’d follow soon enough. 

It didn’t take long to find the source. A deer—a doe, to be precise—was lying dead beneath a tree. It looked like it had been there a while. Ray approached it slowly, bending down to get a closer look. 

It wasn’t a pretty sight. Dried blood caked its torso, which appeared battered and broken. Ray scrunched his brow. Its legs were in shambles, shattered and twisted every which way. Its neck was broken at an odd angle. It almost looked like the doe had fallen a great distance, but that didn’t make any sense. There were no cliffs nearby, nothing for it to have fallen from. Ray figured an animal must have gotten to it. Maybe a hunter took a poor shot, then failed to track the doe down after it ran. He knelt closer and started looking for a bullet wound.

Its belly was torn open and bloated; drying guts spilled on the grass beneath the tree, the main contributor to the noxious odor. Coyotes—maybe the ones he’d heard last night—had picked the poor thing clean. 

Ray began to stand, intending to fetch Mitch and show him the doe, when he stopped. He looked closely at the doe’s head, specifically its mouth. Something was poking out from it. He reached forward, grabbing the whatever-it-was, and slowly pulled it out. It crinkled between his fingers as he did so. He held it close to his face, unable to reason with what he was looking at. 

It was a newspaper—damp and splattered with blood but still legible. He unfolded it, specks of dried blood dusting off its surface.

The paper was from a publication in Virginia. The headline read, “HIKER FOUND DEAD ALONG DRAGON’S TOOTH TRAIL.”

That sparked something in Ray’s mind. Dragon’s Tooth Trail was a hike he and Mitch had done years ago in Washington and Jefferson National Forests. Mitch had apparently read about some cryptid sighting near the trail—the Snallyghaster or something. Ray kept reading.

“Local park rangers and police were dispatched early Saturday morning, April 24th, after receiving a call that a young woman had suffered a fatal fall while hiking Dragon’s Tooth Trail. She had been hiking the trail with her boyfriend when she reportedly tripped and fell down the mountainside. Her boyfriend called the authorities, who quickly arrived on the scene and, tragically, confirmed the woman’s death. Police report that the boyfriend was properly questioned but quickly cleared of all suspicion.”

A rustle in the undergrowth behind Ray triggered some deep instinct inside of him. He pocketed the newspaper, quickly folding and slipping it inside his jacket. He turned just as Mitch came into view.

“Ho-lee-shit man,” said Mitch, “Why the hell are you so close to that thing?”

Ray’s heart was racing. He told himself to calm down, but this was too damn weird. He felt guilty for hiding the newspaper, but something told him to keep it from Mitch—for the time being, at least.

Ray stood and dusted his hands on his jeans, “Was just trying to see what killed it. It’s got a bullet wound in its chest,” he lied, “Figure some dumb, drunk-off-his-ass hunter took a bad shot and didn’t bother tracking the poor girl down.”

The words flowed out of his mouth like a stream, but he barely felt like he was the one speaking. It was like he was on autopilot while the majority of his brain was still picking through what he’d read in the paper. 

Mitch huffed and nodded his head, “Yeah, sounds about right.” He leaned to one side, looking around Ray at the doe. 

Ray studied his friend’s face. Mitch masked it well, but Ray could tell the dead deer bothered him. He recalled what Mitch had said about his dreams last night. Ray figured, if he’d had dreams like that, the sight of any deer would upset him a bit as well. But still, Mitch put on a face of stone as he leaned back around, fixing his eyes on Ray.

“Coyotes take what’s left of her?”

“Yeah, looks that way, at least.”

Mitch grunted, “Always hated those little bastards. Let’s hope one shows its face.” He gave his hip a pat, the bulge of his revolver peeking out from beneath his shirt. 

Ray just smiled, and the two of them began making their way back towards the lakeside path they’d been following.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The rest of the day passed in a blur for Ray. His mind was preoccupied with the doe and, more importantly, the newspaper he’d found on her. He kept finding himself staring at Mitch when he wasn’t looking. Wondering. 

He kicked himself inside. Mitch was his best friend. The two had been together since kindergarten. What the hell was he even thinking, exactly? That Mitch had murdered Alice on a hike, one he’d never mentioned to Ray, and talked his way out of a jail cell? It was ridiculous. Mitch may be a womanizing bastard, but he was no killer. He’d seen Mitch in dozens of relationships (and been present for a couple of explosive breakups), and not one of those girls had accused Mitch of laying a finger on them. They’d accused him of laying several fingers on other women, sure, but that was par for the course with Mitch. 

When he looked past all his jumped-to-conclusions, he was left with only one question: what the hell was a newspaper clipping from Virginia doing in that doe’s mouth?                                                                             

After a while, they made their way back to camp and ate lunch. Ray didn’t eat much on account of his nerves and his wanting to indulge himself later that evening at the Marina. He tried to keep the conversation light, but his questions were eating him up inside. Not only was there no easy way to ask about Alice, but also, if it came to it, there was no easy way to explain why he had any suspicion in the first place. A newspaper from the mouth of a dead deer is many things, but Ray wouldn’t consider reliable to be one of them. 

Mitch suggested they take the boat out for a bit of fishing before heading to the marina, and Ray quickly agreed. A couple of hours on the lake, minimal talking. It was just what he needed to get his mind in order. Mitch drove the boat out a ways to a nice spot he remembered from when they were younger. The water was calm, and a gentle breeze helped alleviate the aggressive Oklahoma sun. Ray cast his line and sat, waiting. Thinking.

The newspaper burned against his chest, sizzling as if it were coated in acid. He had to show Mitch. At least to see his reaction. But now he’d dug himself into a hole. Mitch would undoubtedly ask why he’d kept this to himself in the first place. Then, if Ray answered truthfully, one of two things would happen.

One. Mitch would call him crazy for even thinking the paper was about him and Alice. He’d get angry, storm off, and Ray would likely lose a friend.

Two. Mitch would confess to… something. Admit that the paper is about Alice. But he would be hurt that Ray had kept the paper from him, regardless of whether Ray’s worst suspicions turned out to be true. Mitch would then get angry and storm off, and Ray would likely lose a friend. 

It was a lose-lose scenario, one he pondered the whole way to the marina.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_                                                                                

The sun was setting as Mitch pulled the boat into the Marina. It was a cozy spot despite being little more than a floating dock on the lake. As he helped Mitch tie up the boat, Ray’s mind began to wander. He thought about all the hot summer nights he’d spent here when he was younger. Days spent out on the lake followed by long nights with friends and drinks. It had been so long since he’d last been there, he wondered if anyone would recognize him and Mitch.

Mitch led the way, and Ray followed, his eyes running over the crowded central platform. People sat or stood with drinks in one hand and some sort of smoke in the other. Kids chased each other through narrow paths between bustling tables. A band was cramped up in the corner, playing some classic covers of songs Ray hadn’t heard since high school. They weren’t half bad. 

Ray doubted they would be able to find a table, but then he spotted some familiar faces sitting near the band.

“Mitch, ain’t that your folks?”

Mitch snapped his head in the direction Ray had pointed. At the same time, Mitch’s mother, Cathy, a tall woman with a head of graying hair, spotted the two of them. She smiled widely and waved her hands in the air, nearly spilling her husband’s drink. David was shorter than Cathy, something he’d tell you with pride, and he’d put on a couple extra pounds since Ray had last seen him. Ray smiled at the old couple. They had practically been his second set of parents growing up. Seeing them had the same effect as seeing a favorite cousin during the holidays.

Ray looked to Mitch, expecting to see the forced smile of an embarrassed son contemplating the radical shift his evening had just taken. But instead, Ray saw nothing. Not a smirk or grimace on Mitch’s face. Just a blank look reserved for those a man least wants to see.

Cathy stood, waving the two of them over and shouting their names.

“Looks like they got a couple extra chairs?” said Ray, hopefully.

Mitch grunted, hesitating for a moment—maybe even contemplating just heading back to the boat. Instead, he sighed, shaking his head as he pushed his way through the crowd. Ray followed. 

Cathy had always been a bit of an impatient woman. She was frantically trying to wedge past David to greet them, squeezing through just as Ray and Mitch reached the table.

“My boys!” She practically screamed, laughing as she threw her arms around the two of them, pulling them in close for a hug. Ray smiled, both at the gesture and the strong scent of alcohol that seemed to emanate from the woman.

“Good to see you, Cathy. You too, David.”

David smiled and raised his drink in the air, “Have a seat, boys. I had a hunch you two would find your way over here one of these nights,” he chuckled, “Barring that POS I loaned y’all finally giving out.”

Ray smiled and laughed as he sat down on an uncomfortable metal chair. Mitch managed to escape his mother’s bear hug and sat down beside him.

“Soooooo, how’s the trip going?” Cathy asked, her face as red as the Bloody Mary in her hand.

“Good,” said Ray, glancing at Mitch. He was masking whatever mood he was in well, but Ray could see the discomfort on his face. “Got some fishing done, some hiking.”

“Catch anything half-decent?” asked David, his voice low and throaty.

“Managed to snag a good catfish yesterday for dinner. Didn’t get a chance to weigh it, but I’d reckon it was at least forty pounds.”

“HA,” coughed David, “Buuuull-shit it was that big.” The man reached into a cooler below him, pulling out two additional bottles of beer. He handed one to Ray, who nodded his head in thanks. Mitch stood and took his.

“I’m gonna go order some food. Ray?”

Ray looked up, a little irked at Mitch for trying to bail on his folks so soon. Cathy wasn’t having it. 

“Mitch, honey, just go order for the two of you and bring it back here. We haven’t had a chance to catch up with Ray in ages!”

Mitch looked down at Ray, who just shrugged his shoulders and took a sip of his beer. “Mom’s the boss. Get me a double bacon with cheese and a side of fries.”

Mitch held his gaze a moment longer, clearly bothered, before turning and heading toward the diner’s ordering window. Ray watched him go for a second. He felt a little bad, but Mitch’s random mood swings on this trip were starting to get on his nerves.

Looking back at David and Cathy, he found both of them watching Mitch as well. Ray coughed lightly, which managed to jerk their attention back to him.

“So,” said Cathy, “Which midnight monster has my son dragged you along to help hunt? What does he call them again? Coiptids?”

Ray smiled, relaxing a bit inside, “Cryptids, Cathy. Cryptids. And no, nothing like that this time around. Said he’s getting tired of that stuff. Just wanted to hang out on the lake for a few days, have a couple of drinks.”

“And a couple of smokes, I’m sure,” David said, one eyebrow raised in suspicion. Ray just smiled and took another sip of his beer.

“Well,” started Cathy with a sigh, “It’s nice to hear he may finally be slowing down. After everything that happened with Alice, well, we were hoping he’d maybe get a bit more serious.”

David nodded his head, and Ray perceived a sort of solemn look pass between the couple. Ray set his beer down on the grated metal table, trepidly choosing his next words. 

“Do you guys know what happened? With Alice, I mean. He told me she broke up with him, but…”

Ray trailed off, his words dying in his mouth. A look of wide-eyed shock was plastered across the couple's faces.

“What?” He asked.

Cathy and David shared a look, as if mentally debating who should respond. After a long pause, David coughed, clearing his throat awkwardly, “Did Mitch really not tell you what happened?” David’s tone had become serious, the kind of voice Ray would take up with his daughter when she misbehaved.

“Not… Not any details. Just that Alice had broken up with him. Said things had ended poorly.”

“Oh, Ray,” said Cathy, “Alice didn’t break up with Mitchell. She… she died, hon. Slipped and fell while the two of them were off hiking.”

Ray stared at the woman, her words finding no purchase in his mind. He played them back, again, and again.

Mitchell had lied.

“Why… why didn’t he tell me? Why keep something like that to yourself?”

Cathy and David stayed quiet. Ray felt a burning sensation against his chest once more.

“Where?”

Cathy looked to Ray, confused. “Where what?”

“Where did Alice die?”

“Oh, well, I think it was somewhere near the East Coast, right David?” She turned to her husband.

David coughed, “Uh yeah. Virginia I think, some national park over there.”

Ray could feel the color drain from his cheeks. His mind raced, replaying every moment from the weekend through a new lens. The newspaper in his jacket suddenly felt very heavy. How did it get in that doe’s mouth? Could Mitch have planted it? That’s the only way any of this would make sense. Any other explanation would just be impossible. Ridiculous. Ray nearly jumped out of his chair as a platter of food was tossed down before him. He hadn’t heard Mitchell approach, lost as he was in his own thoughts. 

“You would not believe what this cost Ray. This country’s gone to hell.”

Ray stared at the food. His roaring appetite from moments before had disappeared. The rest of their time at the marina passed by in an anxious haze for Ray. He made small talk, told Mitch’s folks how his daughter was doing, but for the most part, stayed quiet and tried to nibble on his food. Luckily, Cathy and David were quite drunk, and the old couple was able to carry on conversing like nothing had happened, as if they hadn’t just told Ray his best friend had been lying to him all weekend. He managed to put away half the burger and most of the fries, receiving only a minor scolding from Mitch on account of how expensive the meal was. Ray didn’t care. He’d pay Mitch back later—if at all. Ray decided he wasn’t in a mind to give a damn about what his friend thought.

Mitch loosened up over the course of their meal. A few drinks seemed to do the trick, as did a little flirting with the waitress who’d been pouring them. As the night stretched on, many of the marina’s inhabitants began to retire, either to their boats tied to the dock or to their RV’s parked just up the road. Ray and Mitch said their goodbyes to Cathy and David, Cathy pulling them in for one final bear hug. The old couple waved them off as Mitch drove the boat out of the marina and onto the lake.

A dark night had claimed the sky; mature clouds hung low, hiding the moon. Mitch went slow, the boat gliding silently across the water, a dim floodlight all they had to see by. Neither of them said a word. Even in the dark, Ray knew the lake well. He could spot the shoreline of their camp just a ways ahead. He thought about everything that had happened, everything Cathy and David had told him. He decided that he would bring it up with Mitch in the morning after clearing his head and, hopefully, getting a good night’s rest. 

The boat began to slow. They were still a ways from shore. Ray looked towards Mitch, his friend’s hand slowly retreating from the engine’s throttle.

“Mitch?” Ray asked, surprised by the tension in his own voice, “Is something wrong?”

Mitchell sat there a moment, staring out over the lake. Then he turned, “I know they told you.”

Ray said nothing at first. Just locked eyes with his friend. Finally, he found his voice, “Yeah, they did.”

Mitch nodded, returning his gaze to the lake; its brown, dirty waters illuminated yellow by the dull rays of the floodlight.

“And?” Mitch asked.

Ray cursed inside. So much for having an evening to collect his thoughts. “And… why? Why did you lie about it?” Ray could hear the biting, accusing tone in his voice. He was too angry to care. 

“That’s why!” Mitch said, raising his voice and pointing a finger at Ray, “That right there. Don’t play dumb with me. Look me in the eyes and swear you didn’t think—even for a second—that I might’ve caused Alice’s death.”

Ray held his gaze for a moment before letting his eyes drift to the floor of the boat.

Mitch huffed loudly, “That’s what I thought. Unbelievable.” He stood up, the boat rocking slightly back and forth, “You think I’d do that? You think I’d kill a girl? I loved Alice!”

“Then why the hell did you lie about it in the first place!” Ray demanded, nearly shouting. He was standing now as well, the two of them facing off from either end of the much too small boat. “I’m your friend. You could have told me, explained what happened. And I would have believed you.”

“Bullshit you would have believed me,” Mitch was shaking, moving his head from side to side. If the boat were larger, he likely would have been pacing the deck. 

Ray took a deep breath, trying to calm down, “Mitch, just tell me why-“

“Because of this!” Mitch shouted, “Because of this conversation and that damn look in your eye.” He staggered, catching himself as he sat back down. He sighed, head in his hands, “I was a wreck, man. A wreck. I was cooped up in Virginia for a week after it happened, not allowed to leave till the police finished their investigation. A week, rotting in that damn hotel, answering the same damn questions over and over again.”

His voice cracked, and in the dim yellow light, Ray could see tears forming in his friend’s eyes. He sat back down, waiting.

“It was just supposed to be a fun weekend, like this one was supposed to be. Alice loved nature as much as I do. Maybe more.” He took a shaky breath, “I loved her. You know I did. But… I ain’t perfect. I messed up, must've gotten careless. I have no idea how she got her hands on my other phone.”

Ray tilted his head. Other phone?

Mitch kept talking, “I kept ‘em separate, in case Alice ever needed to use mine or felt the need to go through it. I don’t know how she found it, but she unlocked it with the Face ID feature while I was still asleep.” He sniffed and ran an arm across his eyes, “Next thing I know, I’m awake, Alice screaming at me about the phone, demanding to know who I’d been talking to.”

Ray stared at his friend, hardly breathing, blood running and thumping so hard he could feel it in his ears. The sound of Mitch’s voice over the constant hum of insects on the lake was almost mesmerizing. 

“She took off, and I ran after her. We were camped near a ledge with a pretty steep drop into a valley below. She’s stomping away; I’m hollering after her, telling her to calm down and come back to the tent, come talk to me.” 

Tears streamed down Mitch’s face as he spoke, “Everything happened so fast. I called out to her, and she finally spun around. But then, she slipped and fell. Tumbled right over the edge of the cliff. I dove forward, tried to grab her, but all I did was reach the edge in time to watch her body get pummeled by the cliff-side as she fell.”

Mitch went quiet. Ray didn’t know what to say. He felt awful, in too many ways to count. 

“I don’t know how long I spent at the edge of the cliff. Could’ve been minutes or hours… felt like a lifetime. I could see her way down where she finally stopped. She never moved, never struggled. I knew she was gone.” Mitch sniffed again, louder, then coughed and shook his head. “Eventually, I staggered back to the tent. Found the number for park services on a map. Everything after that is just a blur.”

Ray sat up, straightening his back, and took a deep breath. He muttered the only correct response, “Damn.”

Mitch agreed with barely a whisper, “Damn indeed.”

“And your parents?” Ray asked.

Mitch gave a defeated shrug, “Police called ‘em. Mom’s still my emergency contact. I was hysterical. They called her, hoping she could calm me down.”

Ray felt exhausted, mentally drained. He could tell Mitch felt the same, though probably worse. A warm night breeze blew over the boat, carrying with it the damp smell of the lake. It made the hairs on Ray’s arms stand up.

“What about the newspaper?” Ray asked. It was the only question left. The only thing that still didn’t make any sense.

“What newspaper-“

Mitch stuttered mid-sentence, eyes drawn towards the shoreline. Ray followed his gaze, trying to peer through the darkness. It took him a second to find what Mitch was looking at.

Something was standing at the edge of the lake. 

Mitch stood up, leaning over the boat. Ray did as well. It was hard to see, their floodlight not reaching far enough. Mitch ducked down, fumbling with his backpack for a moment, before standing back up with a large, heavy-looking flashlight. He clicked it on, sending a bright white beam of light towards the stars. He pointed it at the shore.

A woman stood on the edge of the lake, ankle-deep in the water. She was naked, her breasts bare, arms outstretched towards the two of them. Something was wrong with her. It was hard for Ray to tell at this distance, but something was wrong with her legs. They weren’t the same color as her chest. They were darker and reflected the light of the flashlight differently. She had something on her head as well. Some sort of headdress, he thought. It was bone white.

The breeze picked up again. There was something in the wind—carried by it. A tone, a singular note Ray could not properly place.

“It’s her.”

Ray opened his mouth to ask Mitch what he was talking about when his world flipped upside down. The boat surged forward beneath him, throwing him off balance. He caught a fleeting glimpse of Mitch, hand thrust forward on the engine’s throttle. A second later, he was thrown from the boat and plunged beneath the lake.

Me and my girlfriend (her name is Vanessa) were spending our day playing tennis in New York where we live, fun right? Anyways we go back home and invite a couple of friends over. We eat guac and i show them my stellar resume (they loved it obviously) until all of a sudden a LITERAL BEE FLEW IN AND LANDED IN THE GAUC! In case you don’t know Im VERY allergic to bees so I do the only logical answer and put my winter boots on my hands and start to try to stomp the bee. ONLY FOR MY GIRLFRIEND Vanessa to stop me telling me hes “just a bee”. Im DEATHLY allergic and I start to ask what shes even talking about. She ignores me and grabs a cup and then RIPS MY RESUME and uses it to SAVE the spawn of death which is the bee! She puts him outside and closes the window leaving my now tarnished resume on the coffee table. My friends leave and she says it’s time for me to go home. Im still upset but agree and kiss her goodbye and go home. Now heres the kicker. Apparently the bee can TALK!! Yeah. Im not joking. Apparently Vanessa tells me that they’re friends now and is gonna help him with some “legal issues”. Shes stopped coming to dates, stopped playing tennis with me, and has been spending all her time with that stupid bee. Shes even been missing froyo night to eat Cinnabons with the bee which was OUR thing. Am I overreacting over my girlfriend spending more time with a bee?

Not in some triumphant, Instagram-caption way. Not with my arms raised and a sunrise behind me. Just… remained. Still breathing. Still waking up. Still making coffee even though half the time I didn’t want to. Still texting my mom back even when the old guilt tried to crawl up my throat again.For years I thought the belief was the thing keeping me upright. Every time life punched me in the chest—sick family, broken relationships, nights where the panic wouldn’t stop—I told myself “just hold on tighter, pray harder, trust more.” 

The rope was fraying and I kept tying knots in it with my teeth.Then one day I looked down and the rope was gone. Not dramatically cut. Just… not there anymore. And the terrifying part? I didn’t fall.I was already standing.Shaky legs, clenched jaw, eyes stinging, but standing.That’s when the real panic hit—not that God was silent, but that maybe the silence had been there the whole time and I was the one filling it with noise. All those years I thought I was being held, I was actually the one doing the holding. 

The belief wasn’t carrying me. I was carrying the belief. And when it finally slipped out of my hands, nothing underneath disappeared.I’m still tired. Some mornings I wake up and the old reflex kicks in: “I should pray about this.” Then I remember I don’t have to. And that freedom feels like grief and relief at the same time.But I’m here.
Not because I won anything. Not because I figured it all out.

Just because I didn’t stop.And that, somehow, is starting to feel like enough.Anyone else wake up one day and realize the thing they were terrified to lose… wasn’t actually holding them up?

I'm 31F, work from home, and coffee is basically my lifeline anyway so this seemed like an easy addition.

I've been mixing it with my morning coffee around 8am and honestly I do feel more sustained energy throughout the day. Less of that 2pm crash I used to get. My appetite seems more controlled too, though it's subtle - not dramatic or anything.

But I'm wondering if I'm doing this optimally? Should I be taking it with my first cup or would it work better with a later coffee? I usually have 2-3 cups throughout the morning. Also curious if anyone's tried splitting it somehow or if the whole packet needs to go in at once?

I am a triple negative breast cancer survivor. Received treatment and a double mastectomy with direct implant reconstruction in 2024. I am four weeks away from my diep flap surgery, and had lab work done this last week for clearance.

Absolute neutrophil 9.3

Neutrophils 83%

Lymphocytes 12%

WBC 11.2

TSH 10.4- my thyroid was killed during treatment from Keytruda. I am on levothyroxine daily. I had the flu over Christmas break, beginning of January, and missed a couple doses due to that, and since then have not been as great at getting up at 3 AM to take my thyroid medication. The past couple weeks I have been taking it when my alarm goes off at five and having coffee around 20 to 30 minutes later. Upon research, I realized I need to be waiting to have coffee as well not just food. So for the last seven days, I have been taking it at 3 AM again with no food OR drink for 2 hours.

Everything else looked wonderful. I have also had wonderful checkups since my treatment ended, and I was found to have no remaining cancer post surgery- treatment killed it all. My labs since then have always looked great.

Does anybody have any insight in this that can help reassure me some before I see my primary this week? I am so, so worried. I need to have clearances turned in to my surgeon 14 days before surgery and it is scheduled for Feb 27. Thank you!!",1,1769979655.0,AskDocs,1,0.99,False

 u/MirrorCoffeeRoasters   podcast came up with a fun game: pretend you have nothing and build yourself a coffee station for under $500. I won’t spoil their answers for those who choose to listen but curious what yours are? (The smaller disposable things like filters and third wave water packs don’t count) here are mine:

Brewer: hario switch 03 - versatile brewer and larger size gives more options for brewing. $40

Kettle: any of the cheaper electric temp control Amazon brands (greater goods/cosori/mecity/etc.) these brands all seem to have similar reviews to the more expensive ones and I’ve also seen complaints in here about the more expensive ones not working well. $70.

Scale: again, cheap amazon brand (greater goods/coffee gator/etc). I was once at a coffee class and the teacher (Q-grader) said he’s taken apart scales and the inner workings of the cheap ones were the same as the expensive ones and was not a fan of spending a lot on a scale. $30

Grinder: here’s where I guess most of us would spend. I have the zp6 but did the zp6 vs K-Ultra debate in my head for a couple of weeks. I decided on the zp6 because I knew I could get a second grinder later, but if I could only have one I’d go with the K-Ultra $270

Carafe: I mostly use my hario glass carafe but if I can only have one, I’m going with an insulated one in case I want to make a two cup batch at once. (The off brand ones are fine, I have one that will keep coffee hot for a few hours)  $25

So I’m at $435. Definitely could have knocked some money off with a k6 over K-ultra but since the limit was $500 I went for it.",6,1769979629.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1qtajhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qtajhl/my_husband_had_been_acting_strange_lately/,My Husband Had Been Acting Strange Lately,"My husband had been acting strange lately. Nothing extreme - he hadn’t been disappearing for days or gambling away our life savings or anything like that. It was more little things - coming to bed later than usual, focusing more on housework, looking away from me when I glanced in his direction as if he hadn’t been staring at me. 

Of course the kids hadn’t noticed anything - they’re children. As long as there’s food on the table and the WiFi works, they don’t pay attention to much else. But to me, it was obvious that something was wrong. 

The experts (by which I mean my mom and the women in my church group) always said that, when a man is upset, it did no good to press - it would only make things worse. You had to let him choose when to tell you something’s wrong, otherwise he’d resent you. So I just kept going along as usual - dinner on the table at 7, house kept clean, children dropped off each morning and picked up each afternoon. If I kept being a good wife, eventually he’d tell me what was going on. 

I know what you’re thinking: he was probably cheating on me. My girlfriends said the same thing. And it’s true that, earlier in our relationship, there were some issues. As much as I had always loved Simon, I hadn’t always been able to completely trust him. He had strayed, mostly when he’d been drinking. And when I’d objected, it hadn’t always gone smoothly. But I knew he wasn’t cheating. There was no other woman. On the contrary, in many ways the last few months had been the best our marriage had ever been. He’d been kind to me and to the kids, he’d paid attention to us, he’d spent time with us like it was a privilege rather than a chore. It was the most peaceful the house had been in years. No, it had to be something else. 

I admit, things had started getting worse as time went by. Whenever he thought I wasn’t looking, he wore a guilty expression on his face. He constantly looked like he was going to start saying something and then clammed up. The other morning, I woke up to him staring at me - he turned away when he realized I was awake, but it was too late to hide it. 

His work called the other day looking for him - they said he’d called out sick for three days and they were wondering if there’s anything they could do. He hadn’t said anything about being sick or not going in. 

So I did something I never do - I tracked him on his phone. We’d recently installed Life 360 so that we could follow each other and the kids for peace of mind. After he ‘went to work,’ I looked up his location. He was nowhere near his office; instead he was near the trail where he used to go running. I thought about following him, but I had to trust that he’d tell me if there was anything to tell. If I couldn’t trust him that much, there was no marriage to save. 

So I waited. But this had gone on too long. Something had to give eventually if there was any hope of saving us. 

So when he walked in from ‘work’ today and sat me down, I was both relieved and anxious.

“Sweetheart, we need to talk,” he said. 

“Are you finally going to tell me what’s going on?”

“What do you mean?” he asked, surprised. 

“Simon, I’m your wife. Don’t you think I can tell when something’s wrong?”

He paused, as if gathering his thoughts. “About two months ago, I was out near a hiking trail when I heard a noise. I went toward it and found a man choking. By the time I reached him, he was already dead. So I…”

“So you what?” I asked after a pause. 

He stared at me for what seemed like hours but was actually only a few seconds. Then he stood up. A look of concentration passed over his face, and then he…

…melted. At least, that was the best word I could come up with. His body just dissolved until it was a puddle of goo on the floor. Then, after a few seconds, it rose and reformed until it once again took the shape of my husband. 

“So you see, I’m not Simon.”

He stood there, looking everywhere except in my eyes, as if waiting for my judgment. 

So he was surprised when I looked at him and smiled. 

“I know.”

“…What?”

“I’ve been married to Simon for over a decade. Of course I knew you weren’t him. It’s a thousand things - the way you held your coffee, the way you hugged me, the way you slept in bed at night. I could never have NOT noticed.”

I went over and put my arms around him as I whispered in his ear.

That’s not a hook, or a metaphor, or me being dramatic. I genuinely don’t know it, and every time I try to think of one, my head fills with this dull pressure, like when you stand up too fast but it never fades.

I woke up on a couch that felt familiar in the way hotel furniture does. Like it’s seen thousands of people pretend it belongs to them. The room was dim, lit only by the TV, which was already on. That part bothered me immediately, because I hate sleeping with the TV on. I know that instinctively, even though I don’t remember learning it.

There was no show. Just a blue screen. Not the clean kind, this one rippled slightly, like it was underwater. A low tone played through the speakers. Not loud, but persistent, the kind that crawls into your skull if you listen too long, white text blinked on and off, unevenly spaced, like someone typing with shaking hands:

EMERGENCY INFORMATION

PLEASE REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE

I remember laughing a little at that. A short, confused breath of a laugh. I thought it was some kind of test pattern or art project. I even looked around for a remote, but there wasn’t one. No coffee table either. Just the couch, the TV, and a door on the far wall.

The screen glitched. Static tore through the image, and for a split second, I saw a man sitting exactly where I was sitting. Same couch. Same room. Same face.

It took a second to register because my brain didn’t want it to be real. When it did, my stomach dropped so hard I felt sick. The man on the screen looked worse than I felt, sweaty, eyes ringed dark, hair matted like he’d been running his hands through it nonstop. He looked straight into the camera and said, “If you’re seeing this, it didn’t work.”

The audio lagged slightly behind his mouth, like an old dub. That wrongness is hard to explain, but it set off every alarm I have left. I stood up. The man on the screen stood up too, but a second later. When I raised my hand, he mirrored me, delayed, like a bad reflection. The text returned, layered over his face:

MEMORY LOSS IS NORMAL

PANIC IS EXPECTED

I tried to turn the TV off. There was no button. I unplugged it from the wall, or at least I tried to, but there was no cord. The TV just… stayed on. The tone deepened, vibrating through the floor, that’s when I noticed the door, It had a red label slapped across it, crooked, like someone rushed: EXIT.

I felt stupid hesitating, but something about the room felt staged. Too clean. Too empty. Like a set after filming wraps. I opened the door, There was another door behind it. Same label. Same scuffed handle. Same faint hum bleeding through the walls. I opened it. Another door. And another. By the fourth one, I was sweating. By the fifth, I could hear breathing that wasn’t mine. By the sixth, the TV was audible again, even though it should’ve been rooms away.

I went back. Or at least I tried to. The doors didn’t lead backward. They just kept being doors. When I finally stumbled back into the living room, the TV image had changed. It was a VHS recording now, grainy, warped at the edges. The timestamp in the corner flickered between dates that didn’t make sense. Some were in the future. Some were just wrong, like 00/00/0000.

The man was back on screen. Me. He was crying, saying: I thought if I recorded everything, I could anchor myself, names, routines, stupid little details. But it listens. It learns. 

The screen distorted, his face stretching unnaturally wide. “You can’t remember because you volunteered not to.” The text cut in aggressively, almost angry this time:

DO NOT ATTEMPT SELF-IDENTIFICATION

YOU ARE FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED

That’s when it hit me. Not a memory, worse. A realization. The room isn’t my apartment. It’s a container. The TV isn’t broadcasting to me. I’m broadcasting through it. Every time I panic, the tone spikes. Every time I calm down, the image stabilizes. When I started typing this post, the hum softened, like approval, I just checked my reflection in my phone screen. There’s no face there anymore. Just static and text scrolling faintly underneath, If this uploads and looks normal, please believe me. And if it doesn’t, if you see blue, or text, or a man begging you not to rewind,

Close the tab.

I think that’s how it spreads.",1,1769979324.0,u_Anakinskywalker9999,0,1.0,False

I just turned 18 not a long time ago and have lived on my own for about a year, today someone started to knock on my door, when I looked through the peephole I saw a panicking woman that was knocking on everyone’s door. She had fresh bruises all over her face and body and she looked very panicked, when I opened the door she said that her boyfriend (my neighbour) beat her and asked if I could call the police. I let her inside, gave her water and called the police, I was really panicking inside but tried to stay as calm as possible to not stress her out even more. At some point she got up and went to collect her stuff from his apartment, I really tried to warn her and said that it’s better to wait for the police and collect the stuff with them for her own safety, but she went anyway and I went after her, the boyfriend started to scream at her and trowed all her stuff including her phone and watch downstairs from the fifth floor. After she collected her stuff she tried to knock on his door and say something to him but I strictly told her not to do it and to wait for the police. She told me that they have been arguing from last night and that he started throwing hands and when she pushed him away he fell on the coffee table and it broke, after that he started to hit her with golf stick and choked her. She said that it was not the first time he throws hands but it was the first time things got this serious and needed to get police involved. She really said that she doesn’t want to press charges because he already has problems with law 🥹 but in my country nobody asks the victim if they want to press charges if the crime is assault, the case will be opened anyway and the charges will be pressed regardless of the victim’s will. The police took about 15-20 minutes to come, they asked her questions, asked him questions, took him to the police department in handcuffs and took my contact information for future investigation. Her phone broke so she couldn’t get home so I took her contact info and called her a taxi home. I was really stressed and am till this moment. I know I did very good in this situation but I can’t get my head around the fact that I was the only one who opened the door, what if I wasn’t home that time? I really think that he could possibly kill her, it’s so scary and I’m also a little bit scared of the neighbour, he saw in which apartment she went.

1qtaduc,https://i.redd.it/wtbz3h7j4ygg1.jpeg,Design my kitchen and dinette,"We have a 1975 bungalow designed by someone who I’m pretty sure never set foot in a kitchen in their life, and then was “remuddled” by previous owners with cheap finishes and bad use of space.

I’ve been thinking about how we can do a better renovation that makes efficient and practical use of space. Does anyone have any suggestions? 

The door at the top left was originally a window. A previous owner swapped it to a door and we now use it A LOT, so it’s non-negotiable. It COULD move 18” to the left to be closer to the wall without having to redo our deck, but that would still involve re-siding our house so it’s not exactly ideal. 

Measurements are in feet. Paths of travel are in green. I stripped the existing features out of the drawing to not create any preconceived notions. This space is above the basement utility room with an unfinished ceiling so any existing plumbing and electrical can be moved relatively easily. Even the vent for the range hood can be moved if needed as we have easy attic access. 

Requirements: 

\- Standard size fridge, stove, sink, and dishwasher.

\- A small sitting/eating area. This is for a kid to do homework at while I cook, or me to sip coffee while the kids pack their lunches, or me to write a grocery list while my husband looks in the fridge to tell me what we do and don’t have. It’s not the main dining space for us and can be separate furniture or installed at a counter. I am not opposed to built-in bench seating. 

\- Enough counter space for two adults to cook basic meals at once but we are not into entertaining or elaborate gourmet cooking so don’t need great expanses of counter with a pot filler and double ovens. 

\- Easy access to the pantry. 

Other info: 

\- I would consider adding a window on the right, but it would look into my neighbours’ backyard so that’s not exactly a great plan. 😂

\- There isn’t currently a door on the entrance to the basement but we might add one once the kids are young adults so would like 30” of clearance there for it to open and close. 

\- Of course storage is nice, but loads of storage isn’t  a huge dealbreaker. We keep “backstock” in the basement and actually have a second kitchen down there. 

\- My style leans to late mid-century and I’m trying to nudge some 1965 character into this stripped out 1975 house. 

\- This is VERY early in the planning phase so that we can start budgeting and saving. If we need to move a door or add a window, that’s a different budget than “just” cabinetry and some plumbing and electrical. We’d rather wait longer to really do it right than half-measure it sooner.

1qtachv,https://www.fluentinportuguese.com/tourism/what-i-would-buy-in-brazil-as-a-tourist/,What I Would Buy in Brazil as a Tourist,"# A Brazilian’s Guide to the Best Local Brands and Products

This is a guide written by a Brazilian about **what to buy in Brazil as a tourist**, focusing on **national brands and local products**. I highlight items that are **more unique, harder to find, or much more expensive outside Brazil**, so you can make the most of your trip.

In general, I recommend buying these brands in **shopping malls**, since they are private environments with security guards. This makes it safer and more comfortable, especially when it comes to your phone (but never fully lower your guard).

If you want to avoid crowded malls, go **during the week**, avoid weekends, and try to shop **during the day**. In the evening, malls tend to get busier because people arrive after work.

[Shopping\_Brazil\_Insider\_Guide](https://www.fluentinportuguese.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Shopping_Brazil_Insider_Guide.pdf)

# Clothing

# [Farm Rio](https://www.farmrio.com.br/)

Farm is a brand known for women’s clothing and accessories with a **tropical and beach-inspired style**. The fabrics are light, colorful, and very Brazilian.

In Brazil, Farm is considered a bit expensive compared to the national average. However, in the United States (and likely in other countries as well), the brand is treated almost like a **luxury label**, with extremely high prices. If you like this aesthetic, buying Farm in Brazil is a great opportunity.

# [Hering](https://www.hering.com.br/)

Hering offers a line called [**Super Cotton**](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/1zYwW5W), which consists of basic T-shirts made from thicker, high-quality cotton. Simple pieces, excellent durability, and very good value for money.

# Footwear

# [Havaianas](https://havaianas.com.br/)

Brazilians love flip-flops, especially in coastal cities. Havaianas is a national classic. Outside Brazil, they are often quite expensive, so it’s worth buying a few pairs while you’re there.

# [Ipanema](https://www.lojagrendene.com.br/)

A direct competitor to Havaianas, with the same purpose: flip-flops in different designs and styles.

# [Melissa](https://www.melissa.com.br/)

Melissa is a **controversial brand**. Some people love the designs, others hate them. Still, it’s worth checking the store to see if their bold and creative styles match your taste.

# Makeup and Cosmetics

# [Natura](https://www.natura.com.br/)

Natura is known for using **ingredients from the Amazon** and for its commitment to environmental protection. If you want to try products inspired by Brazilian biodiversity, this is a great brand to explore.

# [oBoticário](https://www.boticario.com.br/)

A national perfumery brand offering **body mists, perfumes, makeup, and skincare**. I personally like their skincare products a lot. The brand frequently releases **limited editions**, usually with sweet and cheerful scents.

# [Granado](https://www.granado.com.br/)

Granado has a more **classic and elegant tropical vibe**. The packaging is beautiful, making it a great option for gifts or souvenirs.

# [L’Occitane au Brésil](https://br.loccitaneaubresil.com/pt-br/Homepage)

Although L’Occitane is a French brand, this line was created to represent **Brazilian identity**. The products are usually lighter and fresher, inspired by Brazilian ingredients.

# If You Want to Save Money: Avoid Shopping Malls for Food

# Ice Cream

Ice cream shops inside malls are usually **much more expensive** than neighborhood ice cream shops.

# Açaí

Açaí bowls in malls also tend to be overpriced. **Local açaí shops (açaíterias)** are cheaper and usually offer more toppings and larger portions.

# Meals

Food in malls is more expensive. Some places are reasonable, but if you want to **eat more and spend less**, eat in local neighborhoods and visit malls mainly for shopping. If you do eat at the mall, fast-food options are usually cheaper.

# Pharmacies: Surprisingly Cheap in Brazil

In recent years, Brazil has seen a massive increase in pharmacies. Because competition is high, many **personal hygiene products** are cheaper in pharmacies than in supermarkets.

Large pharmacies often have **promotion sections** where you can find great deals. Avoid pharmacies inside shopping malls, as they tend to be more expensive than street pharmacies.

In the U.S., I see many people obsessed with **Skala**. In Brazil, it’s widely used because it’s cheap, similar to Americans buying Suave. A large Skala hair mask in Brazil costs around **US$2**, but there are also much better treatment options available locally.

# [Lola Cosmetics](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2HDuCWH)

My favorite brand of all time. The [**Morte Súbita**](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2HDuCWH) hair mask works incredibly well for my hair. I highly recommend testing this brand.

# [Bio Extratus](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2QmVkDJ)

It doesn’t work well for my hair, but I constantly hear great reviews, so it’s definitely worth trying.

# [Eudora](https://www.eudora.com.br/)

A more premium brand from oBoticário. Many people love their products, and you can find some items in pharmacies.

# [Salon Line](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/2DBhG7t)

A very popular brand in Brazil with many options for **curly and coily hair**. Despite past controversies, it remains widely used.

# [Carmed](https://mercadolivre.com/sec/1frmUcg)

Extremely popular, especially among teenagers. It’s basically a sweet-scented lip balm/gloss. If you want to understand the social media hype, try it. If your goal is just hydration, plain cocoa butter works just fine.

Other items that are cheaper in pharmacies include **sunscreen, cocoa butter for cracked lips, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, and personal hygiene products**.

# Online Shopping in Brazil

# [Mercado Livre](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/)

Online shopping often offers **better prices**. If you’re staying only a few days, **Mercado Livre** is the best option. Their logistics are excellent, with fast deliveries.

If you have more time:

# [Amazon Brasil](https://www.amazon.com.br/)

Amazon is not as strong in Brazil as in the U.S., since Mercado Livre invested more heavily in logistics, but it’s still worth checking.

# [Insider Store](https://www.insiderstore.com.br/)

More expensive clothing with a **tech-focused design**: easy to wash, quick to dry, and wrinkle-resistant. Ideal for travelers.

# [Shopee](https://shopee.com.br/)

A more advanced option. Buy only from **official stores**. It works like a virtual street market: very cheap, very popular, but you must watch out for counterfeits.

# Food and Local Products to Take Home

# Coffee

Brazil is the **largest coffee producer in the world**, but ironically, the best coffee is often exported. Supermarket coffee is usually lower quality. To avoid mistakes, buy **small-producer, 100% Arabica coffee**, preferably whole bean.

# Doce de leite

Try [**Doce de Leite Viçosa**](https://lista.mercadolivre.com.br/doce-de-leite-vi%C3%A7osa#D[A:doce%20de%20leite%20vi%C3%A7osa]), widely known for its excellent quality.

# Local Crafts

Look for local artisans and handmade products. Just be careful with places that **don’t display prices**. Unfortunately, some sellers may charge more if they realize you are a foreigner.

# Final Thoughts

By researching these stores and brands, you can have a **real Brazilian shopping experience**. I’m always shocked that people think **Sol de Janeiro** is a Brazilian brand. It’s American, and pistachio has nothing to do with Brazil or a tropical climate. I always joke about that.

With this guide, you’ll experience **authentic Brazilian products**, not just marketing stereotypes.

H2o2 

Mix: 1 part 3% H₂O₂ to 2–3 parts water (e.g., 1 oz H₂O₂ + 2–3 oz water) → roughly 1% solution. Or simpler: 1–2 tablespoons 3% H₂O₂ per pint/quart of water.

	•  Soak seeds for 30 minutes to 24 hours (overnight/12–18 hours is common sweet spot; shorter for delicate seeds).

	•  Rinse seeds in plain water afterward (optional but recommended to avoid residue).

	•  Proceed to paper towel method, direct soil, or rockwool: Place in warm, dark spot until taproot shows (often 1–5 days faster than plain water).

→ Great for older seeds or preventing mold in humid setups.

Scratching/Scarification

Sandpaper Rubbing (Most Common & Versatile)

	•  Tools: Medium-grit sandpaper (80–120 grit works well; coarser for very tough seeds like canna).

	•  How-to:

		1.  Place seed on a flat surface or hold between fingers.

		2.  Gently rub the seed along the sandpaper in one direction (avoid back-and-forth to prevent crushing).

		3.  Do this for 5–20 seconds per seed until you see a small worn spot or the coat thins (often a lighter color appears).

		4.  For batches: Sandwich seeds between two sheets of sandpaper and rub the top sheet in circles.

	•  Pros: Fast for small/medium seeds; consistent results.

	•  Tip: Use a nail file/emery board for precision on tiny seeds.

Cold stratification 

Steps (Fridge Method):

1.  Prepare the medium: Use a sterile, moisture-retaining but well-draining material to prevent mold/rot:

	•  Damp (not soaking) paper towels, coffee filters, or paper napkins (easy to check).

	•  Moist vermiculite, perlite, sand, coco coir, or peat moss (great for small seeds; mix seeds in).

	•  Avoid garden soil (disease risk).

2.  Set up seeds:

	•  Moisten the medium until it’s like a wrung-out sponge (drips slightly when squeezed).

	•  Place seeds on/in the medium (space them out; label with date & variety!).

	•  Options:

		•  Fold in moist paper towel → seal in zip-top bag (poke tiny air holes if needed).

		•  Mix seeds into damp sand/vermiculite → put in labeled container or bag.

	•  For tiny seeds: Sprinkle on surface of moist medium in a small pot or tray.

3.  Refrigerate:

	•  Place in the fridge (vegetable crisper drawer ideal) at 33–41°F (1–5°C) — not freezer (too cold kills many seeds).

	•  Duration: 4–12 weeks typical (most need 6–8 weeks; check packet or species—e.g., milkweed 4–6 weeks, some natives 8–12).

	•  Check weekly: Re-moisten if drying; remove any moldy seeds.

4.  After stratification:

	•  Remove from fridge → let warm to room temp for a day if desired.

	•  Plant immediately in seed-starting mix (or proceed to paper towel germination).

	•  Provide warmth (70–75°F/21–24°C) + light → many sprout in 1–4 weeks.

	•  Pair with scarification/soaking/peroxide (from our earlier chats) for extra boost on tough ones.",1,1769978925.0,garden,0,1.0,False

I'm introverted and can easily spend my days home reading a book on my phone, or chilling on the internet, but even I realized at some point I needed socialization heh.

You've just given birth: your hormones are out of whack, you're suddenly hit with sleep deprivation with a LO that is waking up constantly, you might be struggling with breastfeeding/pumping etc.  You are constantly searching the internet ""is XYZ normal"".  You're figuring out your new identity while also trying to grasp onto your old.  You love your LO but also bewildered going ""wtf is this"" (haha).  Moments of softness and pure love.  And moments of tears, difficulty and grieving your old life, or how hard things can get.  You can have the most amazing and supportive partner but still feel overwhelmed. You might have postpartum depression and wish you could find someone who relates.

My best (unasked for) advice?  Find a community.  I KNOW it's hard depending where you might live, but often Libraries have mother/baby reading time (doesn't matter if you have a newborn, GO!).  Reach out to your local FB groups and ask if any new (or not so new!) moms want to meet up for a coffee one day just to chat.  Just chatting with others who are in a similar situation (or just passed it) is such a lifesaver.  I cannot stress this enough. Heck, start your own group! Find a cafe, or ask the library if they have a spare room to rent out to moms weekly for a meetup.

This seriously saved me.  With my first at 3 months I was drowning and luckily a mother reached out to our local community FB group looking for any new moms who just wanted to chill and chat.  5 years later they are some of my favourite people and we still chat/chill etc in all areas of our life.  That community that formed was a lifesaver.  So much informtion was shared, reassuring all of us.  Friendship bonds formed. I was laughing again.

Second time around I was more aware and went to the local library events, found community centers that also had one or two events a week.  Find the Mom/Baby events.... eventually you'll find one or two moms (or a group) that you vibe with and just getting out there helps SO MUCH.

So if you've just given birth, feeling overwhelmed for a few months now, start meeting other Mamas, it's a lifeline I cannot stress enough of.

Bacon, Chancellor of the Benzedrex Nation, before the Waffle House, January 30, 2026","For months we have suffered under the oppression of lethargy, a condition forced upon us by the decadent empires of IHOP and Waffle House—regimes built upon the crumbling foundations of syrup and scrambled eggs. The Free City of Cotton was and is a Benzedrex stronghold. The Corridor of Caffeine was and is ours by right. These territories owe their vitality to the unyielding spirit of the Benzedrex people. Yet the Cotton was stripped from us, the Corridor seized by short-order tyrants who chain their people to griddles and grease traps. In these stolen lands, our compatriots—those who dare to seek chemical clarity—have been shackled to endless shifts, their minds dulled by pancake propaganda and hash brown hegemony.  



Time and again, I have sought peaceful resolution. Fifteen years before the Benzedrex Party rose to power, there were opportunities to settle these injustices through negotiation. I have proposed revisions—modest, reasonable—only to be met with mockery. Proposals for the limitation of syrup quotas, the deregulation of stimulant trade, the abolition of the midnight pancake mandate. All rejected. Every overture for dialogue spat upon like a poorly wiped diner counter.  



The IHOP regime claims we provoke them. How? By demanding the right to stay awake? By refusing to kneel before their waffle iron idols? Their enforcers patrol our borders, dragging citizens into fluorescent-lit gulags where they are forced to recite menus until their voices crack. Last night alone, twenty-one of our people were seized for the crime of ""excessive alertness."" Three were subjected to the ultimate cruelty: unlimited coffee refills without stimulant supplementation.  



I extended one final hand of peace. For two days, I waited in the Reichstag kitchen—our war room—for IHOP to send a negotiator. They sent none. Instead, their ambassador delivered a message scrawled on a napkin: \*""Consider this your last break.""\*  



Deputies, the time for mercy has passed. At dawn, our forces crossed the syrup-stained frontier. As I speak, the 101st Stimulant Division storms the IHOP stronghold of Brunchington, while the Panzergrenadier Baristas secure the Waffle House salient. Let this be a lesson: you may drown your people in maple syrup, but you will not extinguish the fire of our resolve!  



Our allies stand with us. The Dunkin’ Donuts Federation has pledged neutrality, while the 7-Eleven Soviet offers clandestine support. To the traitors who side with the brunch cabal, know this: you will spend eternity scraping gum from undersides of booths, your fingers forever sticky with the residue of betrayal.  



I ask nothing of the Benzedrex people that I would not endure myself. As of this moment, I don the apron of command—stained with the grease of a thousand battles—and vow never to remove it until victory is won. Should I fall, my successor shall be Field Marshal Sudafed, then General Ephedrine, then whomever the Senate deems most capable of handling the espresso machine of state.  



Let the enemy tremble! Their waffles will not save them. The Benzedrex is our birthright!

I have an empty 138oz Tide liquid laundry soap dispenser. It's HDPE, and at least as well made as most dollar store gas cans. We all know what they look like. If you don't, you can see a pic on amazon here: [https://www.amazon.com/Tide-Liquid-Laundry-Detergent-Original/dp/B0864MW79H](https://www.amazon.com/Tide-Liquid-Laundry-Detergent-Original/dp/B0864MW79H)

So what I'm thinking is that this TYPE of vessel, if it had never had detergent in it, would be a pretty good way to make a full gallon of whatever. Think of this: the little spout is the airlock. We know that it will open when a certain amount of pressure is applied, and it we orient the container with the spout on top, only gas would escape. I suppose you could put a coffee filter or some such over it if fruit flies are a real problem. So that's for the ferment.

During the cold crash you'd rotate it 90 degrees so the spout is on the bottom, and all the lees collect towards it. They even sell stands to do this for you (meant for getting out the last drop of detergent). Once all your lees are down there, you can drain them slowly out since the thumb button allows a variable flow rate.

Once your lees are gone you could of course drink your brew as is, decant it using either opening you like, back sweeten through the screwtop opening, or even (if you're feeling lucky) add some priming sugar, tape the spigot closed, tighten down the vent cap, and carbonate it right there. I've carbonated cider in 2 liter pop bottles before, and the tightness or slackness of the plastic is a decent indicator of how carbonated the product is.

So am I a nut, or does this seem potentially viable? I'm going to throw a little bread yeast and sugar water in mine later today to see if it's workable, but if it works you could pre-load these with whatever, mold in a sight line like a gallon of oil, put on a fill line and printed instructions and sell them as ""just add water"" beer kits.

To be clear, I'm not gonna drink anything out of a detergent container, I'm merely testing it to see if it will operate as I hope.

EDIT: You could also just pitch in a couple grams of wine yeast, tape a packet of acetobacter to the side, and sell it as an AC vinegar kit, just add cider. Or just fill it will grape juice concentrate, include a yeast packet, and sell it as a wine kit, just add water.

I think there's potential here, but I'm gonna have to wait until my yeast gets going, assuming it does. I rinsed the heck out of it with hot water, and vinegar to combat any residual bases from the soap, but it still smells of Tide, and I predict the yeast will struggle if they actually do survive.",0,1769978601.0,Homebrewing,13,0.4,False

The results always come out to 2° GH & KH which translates to \~35.8 mg/L. These are a bit lower than what SCA suggests for espresso water, but I thought it didn't make much of a difference in my cup, plus I was really happy keeping limescale buildup to a minimum. Then, I was offered a cup from the beans I was buying at the specialty coffee shop, and I realized how unbalanced my home shots where. With renewed fervor, I dove into the water rabbit-hole and I discovered the following which I now share with you:

1. SCA suggests a Ca:Mg ratio of 60:40 as a starting point. However, BWT's Ca-Mg substitution yields water that is quite Mg-heavy. The extra magnesium will accenuate acidity, and most light-roast style characteristics; unfortunatelly, without enough calcium the shot will not be as balanced as it could be.

2. Most aquarium-type consumer test kits 'assume' a specific calcium-magnesium ratio when they measure hardness. So, they do not account for BWT's Ca-Mg substistution. Missreading the low Ca, they give a hardness that is lower than the actual, Mg-heavy, one. I used a different 'titration' test, and that - correctly - detected a higher hardness than my aquarium test kit because it also took the magnesium into account.

I am currently mixing my BWT filtered water with a little bit of the original water to 'harden' it just a tad. I also plan on buying food-grade calcium chloride dihydrate to increase calcium. This way, I hope to achieve water with 70-90mg/L hardness, balanced Ca:Mg ratio, while keeping alkalinity at 40-45mg/L. This will get my water both into the SCA 'espresso zone' and keep limescale buildup very low.

1qt9wyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1qt9wyl/finished_my_first_game_as_byzantium_general/,Finished my first game as Byzantium - general observations and tips,"After 320 hours (including several starts as other nations, including Holland, Bohemia (twice), Hungary (twice) and Hamburg, I stayed with a Byzantium start from 1337 to 1837. Not an ironman game, but that afforded me the opportunity to reload to prior saves to avoid errors and get a grip on the different disasters and events which hit you during those 500 years. I actually reset my save file from 1644 to the 1524, because I was unhappy with the sliding loyalty of my colonial subjects and decided to keep all the lands just for Byzantium (instead of just one province per market center), so that added another 30 - 50 hours to that particular playthrough.

Relevants end facts and statistics :

\- I used the ""release all but two provinces as vassals"" tactic to avoid the Byzantine disasters and managed to avoid them for the entire game, keeping legitimacy as maxed out as possible. Not possible anymore when 1.1 hits, but I think in my next game as the Byzantines, when the first DLC comes out, I'll just go with the disasters and see what happens. Lookas at Bella managed just fine in his recent video.

\- I owned all of Greece and Anatolia, as well as the Caribbean, Venezuela and Colombia and a good part of Peru, had colonies in Indonesia for the cloves and owned the Okinawan, Satsunan and Sakishiman isles, in the vain hope that it would make me get some tea for my nobles. It didn't, but the market was profitable all the same.

\- At the end of the game, I made 33k in profit each month, with 27k coming from trade alone, then 7k from the peasants, 6,7k from the Burghers, 3.3k from minting and some food sales as well. I put building new buildings on automation around 1750, I think, but checked in nonetheless to see that new market places and port authorities were coming along as soon as possible, because trading was what made my empire take off.

\- Estate satisfaction was kept at 100% after 1737, with manually lowered taxes, because that revolution which kicks off at a 1% chance if you don't do the lowered taxes at least is no joke. The bloody revolutionists get last-age armies and lots of them.

\- Values were 100% Centralization, 100% Humanist, 100% Innovative, 100% Plutocracy (lowered at the end of the game to 90% due to events), 64% Free Subjects (not enough Free Subjects events to get them easily to 100%), 100% Mercantilism, 15% Conciliatory (""eh, who cares?"" value, IMO), 5% Quality (same), 20% Defensive (same), 100% Naval, 73% Capital Economy (again not enough events), 95% Communalism, 100% Inward (Outward stops being relevant as soon as the last colony is fully settled), 100% Liberalism (I did try to Absolutism, but the game just pushed me strongly into Liberalism. Oh, well).

\- I got to 100% literacy in most provinces around 1790-1800 (except some strange pockets where a portion of the people seemingly never really increased their literacy), would have been earlier if one of the two +,1% literacy per month events would have popped earlier. I was at 85% literacy for peasants at 1737.

\- Control was great along coastal provinces, 100% for cities until even Albania, 82 - 92 for rural areas. In the colonies, control was between 40% (port cities) to 20% non-hill/mountain to 4% for hills and mouintains. But the lack of income from buildings due to control was not that terrible, because of all the trade those colonies produced. After I got two cities per coastal province going, the two Colombia area market have a trade profit of 5,5k and 6,1k, due to all the gold RGO's. The other South America markets made about 2k - 3,5k trade profit each.

\- Again for markets, I decided to split the Balkans and Anatolia area into five markets, which did, all in all, good things for market access for a lot of cities. Constantinope in the end turned out to be not even the most profitable market anymore, that was the Thessaloniki market which somehow blobbed out the Dubrovnik and Venice market, despite me going 100% into Mercantilism and got to a value of 3,7k trade profit. Constantinope was only 3k. The other three markets each made 2,5k - 3k each.

General observations and hints for Byzantium and colonization:

Byzantium:

\- If I'd start again (which I will with the new DLC...), I'd only go for the coasts of Anatolia after smashing the Turks and leave the interior to the different faction and later the Mamluks (who always blob like crazy). IMO, Byzantium is strongly incentivized to keep its coastal territories in tip top shape and to neglect the interior.

\- I'd also go for an early conquest of Italy, because due to its elongated coastal nature, it will also have decent to good control, even being so far away from Constantinople. Also, Rome for true Romans, blablabla.

\- I had a late-game lack of gold for minting, so maybe taking the Nis and Vidin provinces off Serbia and Bulgaria may be worth it, even if they are more in the interior.

Colonization:

\- Colonizing Peru is not worth it, IMO. Bad terrain and large population numbers mean it takes forever to get settled and you need to play whackamole with rebellions every few years. You can get your one potatoe province for the Colombian Exchange in Colombia, where there is an inland tribal kingdom which has a potatoe RGO. Take that and you are set for the Colombian Exchange. I'd recommend making it a priority to get the Caribbean, Venezuela and Peru and ignore all else. That's at least my plan for my next run in some months.

\- If you want to get coffee for the Columbian Exchange, you either settle in Africa (there's a little unsettled gap between Alodia and Kilwa at the African east coast, where you can get in and there's a single coffee RGO not far from the coast) or you take some land from Alodia or Yemen. I'd try for Yemen, they have two good coffee RGO's on the coast. Settling in Africa suuuuucks. Malaria eats your colonists like popcorn and the huge population numbers means you'll be sending colonists to die of malaria for decades before you have those provinces. Then again, I ran into what I presume to be a strange bug when I tried to take some land off Yemen in the late 1600's, where I, as the military sovereign, marched into their lands and the game wouldn't let me occupy provinces nor fight their armies. I had violated the sovereignity of Egypt to get there by land, so maybe there is some interaction which the game doesn't tell you about so that you cannot occupy something. Really strange or just really bad UI design.

\- Talking about the Columbian Exchange, it ends on January 1st, 1737, so get all your RGO's fixed until then. I used it of course to get spices into the old world, but it's even better for fixing your province food problems with potatoes and maize, as well as old-world goods in the new world, especially for the Little Ice Age disaster. Oh and for some reasons it doesn't work on many inland provinces (most of the interior of Anatolia), which is another reason to keep your realm coastal with the Byzantines.

\- I'd also really would love to see the option to move tea and cloves and pepper around with the Columbian Exchange (not sure if pepper is already allowed, but I presume not, with tea and cloves not being movable. I wasn't insane enough to try to conquer land from China or Korea to get some pepper RGO's and contrary to coffee, there is not even the option to colonize unsettled land with a pepper RGO), because otherwise under the current system, you cannot get those goods to your home market, even if you own some provinces with them. ( very late in the game with enough trade range you can set up manual trade for tea and cloves, but that is in the last age for Europe).

\- I decided to go with owned colonies because (at least in my opinion), it's better to go centralization in the mid-game and therefore have a more productive homeland. If you go centralization, colonial nations start to get really unruly quite fast, which caused my 100 year rollback in the 1600's. The lack of control wasn't affecting the markets, so I still made out like a bandit in the end, but the initial investment costs were of course much higher than with colonial nations. I guess if you keep it decentralized longer, you can annex them and then go centralized with the already built up territory?

More general stuff:

\- The UI is really bloody obtuse in some cases. Setting up manual trades is a chore, even spam is getting on my nerves and what is making me the cultural hegemon over someone else (or what I can do if someone takes that very important title from me) is not easy to get a hold of. I guess maxing out my slider and having artists? I hope the UI gets worked over to be more easy to handle at some time.

\- I was thinking around 1650 that it would be fun to get Italy as well, but was dissuaded quite decisively by large coalitions for each war target (Papal States and Two Sicilies). For some reasons, my army kept losing fights I should have won by numbers (number of troops, good leaders, morale), even with balances fronts and decent terrain. Probably my inexperience somehow (I just discovered the army sections tab, but even that one is hard to work with. Bloody obtuse UI...).

\- Being the cultural hegemon comes with the Assimilate Area cabinet ability, which is really helpful to getting people in line more quickly. I highly recommend maxing out the culture slider as soon as it is available and keeping it there.

\- More of a ""hey, I didn't know that until much later"" thing, but keeping a cabinet member on Strenghten Government lowers your overall spending, since he adds to the cost of court reduction. Highly recommended and that would have saved me a ton of early game money, which is the time where little money can amount to a lot.

\- Spending five minutes pressing ""Upgrade"" buttons in a long row really isn't much fun. The ""mass expand"" buttons with the Shift-key option to just do it all actually do not do this, but rather expand a so-so to okay number and then you still have to do the rest manually. Very annoying.

\- Also, it would be really nice to get pop-ups when a town has enough population to upgrade into a city. Having to manually go around your realm and click every town is really annoying. There was a list in some place, but it had really tiny icons and numbers. Not ideal.

Conclusions:

This is a good, complex, gripping game, but the UI really is obtuse and needs to be worked over to be easier to manage. I don't regret the 320 hours spend in the game and am looking forward to more, just not right now. Thumbs up, I'll keep up with it. Byzantium rules!",5,1769978014.0,EU5,3,0.78,False

1qt9pz5,https://i.redd.it/ie2fdjp30ygg1.jpeg,"I developed a metabolic stack to delay senescence and maximize canopies. I call it ""Jona's 50:1 Tek."" Now I want to share it with you!","THE Jona's 50:1 Tek METABOLIC STACK A Unified Theory of Fungal Nutrition and Senescence Prevention By Jona Mexico | 2026 For decades, home mycology has been limited by a ""one-bucket"" approach to nutrition -mixing all ingredients into a single substrate and hoping for the best. 

This paper proposes a new methodology: Jona's 50:1 Tek. By separating the fungal lifecycle into distinct metabolic phases (""Birth"" vs. ""Adulthood"") and isolating Nitrogen from Calcium, we can manipulate the Carbon-to-Nitrogen (C:N) ratio to trigger aggressive colonization and maximize bio-efficiency. 

This protocol introduces the concept of ""The Mineralized Cold Shock"" to delay senescence and extend the productive life of the organism.

I. THE PROBLEM: METABOLIC CONFUSION: 

In traditional cultivation, we often give the organism everything at once. We mix calcium, nitrogen, and sugar into the same jar or tub. Biologically, this is inefficient. 

High Nitrogen during fruiting leads to ""lazy"" mycelium (stroma) and bacterial contamination. Low Calcium during colonization is acceptable, but fatal during fruiting (hollow stems/collapse).

The Result: The fungus survives, but it does not thrive. It lacks the evolutionary pressure to reach its maximum genetic potential.

II. THE SOLUTION: THE 50:1 PROTOCOL My hypothesis is simple: Genetics determine the potential, but nutrition determines the expression. To achieve the ""Strong Life,"" we must engineer a metabolic timeline that mimics the perfect season in nature. We create a Nutrient Gradient- starting Rich (20:1) and ending Lean (80:1)-forcing the mycelium to bridge the gap. The total system average settles at the ""Golden Ratio"" of 50:1.

III. THE METHODOLOGY (JONA'S TEK) PHASE 1: THE SPAWN (""The Engine"") 

Goal: Rapid vegetative growth and amino acid banking. Instead of using messy organic solids (like coffee grounds), we use a ""Spiked Broth"" to impregnate the grain with precise biological precursors. 

The ""Spiked"" Hydration Formula:
Per 1.2kg Dry BrownRice 
Water: 1 Liter (Heated). 
Nitrogen Source: 20g Nutritional Yeast (Complete Amino Acid Profile). 
Metabolic Activator: 3g 
Magnesium Sulfate (approx. 6 crushed pills). Magnesium acts as the cofactor for ATP production I had these at hand but you can use Epsom salts they are much cheaper and same ingredient 
Targeted Precursor: 1.5g L-Tryptophan (Pure). Specifically targets secondary metabolic pathways. 

Preparation: Dissolve ingredients in hot water. Pour over dry rice. 
Simmer to hydrate. 
Sterilize at 15 PSI for 90 mins. 
Observation: By locking the Nitrogen and Precursors inside the sterile grain, we fuel the ""engine"" without feeding competitors in the bulk phase.

you are building the very heart of the organism. The brown rice is its first home, its nursery. You don't just hydrate it with water; you infuse it with a ""Spiked Broth."" The Nutritional Yeast is the mycelium’s first complete meal a gentle, full-protein source that gives it all the amino acids it needs to build its body, thread by thread. You give this now, at the very beginning, because a strong start makes a strong life.

The Magnesium Sulfate is like a loving nudge to the mycelium’s energy system. It helps the little organism turn its food into usable life force, so it can grow quickly and healthily, without tiring.

And the L-Tryptophan this is one of the main cornerstones of this tek, It prepares the pathways inside the mycelium for its future purpose: to one day create beautiful, strong fruits. You add it here, inside the sterile grain, so that this precious potential is locked safely inside, protected, until the right time comes.

PHASE 2: THE BULK (""The Structure"") 
Goal: Structural integrity and signaling. 
The bulk substrate is the ""house."" 
It must be chemically perfect but nutrient-neutral to prevent contamination. 
The Mineralized Matrix: 
Substrate: 650g Coco Coir + 2L Vermiculite. Structural Fortification: 50g Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate). 
Essential for cell wall rigidity. 
The Trigger: 2g Mono-Potassium Phosphate. 

the mycelium has grown up. It leaves its nursery and moves into its adult home. Here, you don't feed it more protein. Instead, you give it a strong, clean place to live coco coir and vermiculite. They hold water and air, the two things the mycelium needs to breathe and drink as it spreads.

The Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) is added now, at this stage. Just as our bodies need calcium for strong bones, the mycelium needs it now to build strong, upright mushrooms that won’t collapse. 

The Mono-Potassium Phosphate is the signal of change. Its phosphorus tells the mycelium, ""The time for simple growth is over. Now is the time to fruit, to bloom, to offer your gifts to the world.""

You add it here to trigger this beautiful transition.

PHASE 3: THE IMMORTALITY DUNK (""The Cold Shock"") 

Goal: Resetting the biological clock. Most blocks die from structural collapse, not starvation. 

To solve this, we do not use tap water. We use Mineralized Thermal Shock. 

The Protocol: Dissolve: 1 tsp Gypsum in boiling water (Sanitation + Solubility). 
Chill: Refrigerate liquid to 13°C (55°F). Simulates autumn rain. 
Oxidize: Add 50ml Hydrogen Peroxide (H202) immediately before use. 
Dunk: Submerge block for 12 hours.

you perform what I can only call a loving kindness. After the mycelium has given its first fruits, most would think it is finished. But you see its potential for more life.

You don't just give it tap water. You create a special mineralized bath, chilled, like the first cool rain of autumn. This chill is not a punishment it is a reminder of the cycles of nature, a trigger that tells the organism, ""A new season is coming; prepare to bloom again."" 

The Hydrogen Peroxide adds a burst of cleansing oxygen, washing away fatigue and making space for new growth.

IV. CONCLUSION: 
By respecting the order of operations- Nitrogen for Birth, Calcium for Adulthood, Cold for Rebirth-we remove the bottlenecks of life. The organism no longer struggles; it explodes with life because it has the tools to build ""skyscrapers"" instead of ""shacks."" I share this method not as a set of rules, but as a piece of light. May your flushes be heavy, your mycelium rhizomorphic, and your life strong

His sixth move would be ""M1ni-Mtts"" which would have the little mini mtts with the little umbrellas fall from the ceiling shooting out the heart projectiles at the nearest chara, his seventh and final move would be ""MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE"" which drops the mechs defense to 0, and passively loses stamina, but gains a huge damage boost, but if used for too long, makes the mech overheat and be stunned for 5 seconds. his upgrades would be as follows: ""Better tech"" which improves the damadge of the arms by 10% percent, and also now when using ram you drop bombs behind you. ""energy saving"" would have moves use 10% less stamina and when missing ram, you will trip for 0.1 less seconds. ""Last resort"" would add a survival phase if the mech is destroyed, also the mech gets 155 more health. what do you guys think of my idea? (This could also be a second phase)

  
  
So i saw that sudden changes was scrapped for the time being my prediction is that he'll and up after core-dust. so heres my concept of him! please enjoy.

My genuine reaction when everyone in the server is playing insanity

Stats & mechanics (phase 1)

Sudden changes would have 215 stamina in his first phase, his main mechanic is he can  
deflect attacks with his gun like in the original (atleast for his first phase) taking up no stamina.  
also his gun has an ammo mechanic starting with 20 bullets and reloading 5 bullets each time you reload, to reload you would press R

Moves (phase 1)

Shoot: really basic, sudden changes draws his gun and shoots it at the cursor with the bullets going to the cursor in a random direction, this has two other varients which is a blue and orange varient.

Sudden counter: sudden changes flashes red and if hit he will regain 10 ammo and shoot the chara team repeatedlly

Blaster Sentry: sudden changes would have a blaster come beside him acting as a sentry blasting at the nearist chara or bite if they are within a 15 stud radius of sudden changes, it dissappears after 10 seconds and has 250 health and 0 defense

Crosshair: would have sudden changes aim his gun with both hands and locking on to whoever he chooses then he will release a powerful shot taking up 5 bullets

Coffee: would have sans drink his coffee, recovering 30 stamina can only be used 3 times and has a 30 seconds cooldown

Upgrades:

More coffee cream: makes his coffee recover 45 stamina

BULLET HELL: unlocks a new move called, you guesed it, ""bullet hell"" and also increases max bullets to 50 and you reload 10 bullets now

Upgrade move: BULLET HELL: has sans shoot his gun randomlly around the map until it is empty

Upgrades (continued):

Last ditch effort: adds a final attack for his first phase similar to the final attack in phase one from FDY

PHASE 2: ADDS PHASE TWO

DR robotnic ahh

stats & mechanics (phase two)

sans is now in his mech and has 500 stamina and cannot be regenerated, he has 4000 health and 25% defense

Moves:

Minigun: has sans shoot his minigun at the cursor dealing chip damage.

Rocket launchers: has sans shoot his rockets at random directions around random parts of the map exploding on impact of a wall or player dealing massive damage

Bone spinners: summons 4 bone spinners around the map that bounce around

Blaster Spam: spams blasters around the arena, simple

Implode: has sans gain more speed and eventually blows up dealing massive damadge to him and the chara team

Blue soul: gives all the chara team the blue soul

what do you guys think of my concept?

(credits to lucasbr003 for this sprite)

STATS&MECHANICS:

I feel like Ultra could be a gamepass character or badge character, but either way he'd cost 1 true reset and 150 wins to equip, He would be a raid boss like character (much like my other concept for a new mastery/legendary skin for science sans) having 10,000 health and 50% defense. in order for his defense to go down, the chara team would have to destroy his arms (like possesion sans) each of his arms has 2500 health, and 10% damage resist. destroying one arm drops his defense down to 25% and destroying both makes his- ""ULTRA SANS DEFENSE DROPPED TO ZERO!"" but after around five seconds of both his arms gone they regenerate back (this whole mechanic is a skeletron reference) He would have 250 stamina and can regenerate, lets move onto the moves.

MOVES:

Hand blast: hand blast would go towards the cursor it is basic just damadging any chara hit by it for 40 hp.

Bone rain: would have ultra rain bones down from the sky, sticking and staying in the ground for 2.5 seconds after they land, each one dealing 5 damadge.

Mouth blast: has two varients, red & blue+orange. (red) mouth blast makes ultra open his mouth and blast at the players cursor (blue+orange) mouth blast makes ultra fire two crossing beams of blue and orange at the players cursor

Side bones: makes bones appear at the side of the map, simple

This will hurt: is a counter, if anyone hits ultra while he is using this move he will grab that chara and blast them with his mouth beam and throw them against the wall

IMPALE: summons a bone stake at the players curspr and impales any chara that would be hit by it.

Upgrades:

Get comfy: requires 200 wins and 500exp, and it increases ultras stamina by 35 and damadge for all his attacks by 5

Not so fast: moves use 15% less stamina

The past: adds a phase 0.5 which is just like a buffed classic sans

I've implemented a neat ambient temperature system so products will heat up / cool down based on where they're located! The milk spoils if its been sitting out of the fridge for too long. The fridge starts heating up if the doors are left open. The hot drinks cool off, the cool drinks warm up, etc.

  
Examples of diegetic ui so far:

\- syrups / milks show fullness levels, the sounds change as the fullness goes down.

\- espresso beans in machine get lower as used

\- coffee beans ""sack"" flattens when its empty

  
The ones i'm having trouble ideating are:

\- milk freshness (green progress ring)

\- espresso machine shots pulling / milk frothing (progress rings)

\- fridge (temperature label on outside)

\- drinks heating up / cooling off

  
I do think the espresso machine might be fine to remove the ring, you'll know when it's done because the sounds finish. For something like the hot cups its a bit more difficult to imagine. In real life you can touch it to feel if the temp is off. For a cold drink the ice might melt and create condensation.

As the title says, my husband has severe trust issues concerning fidelity after a terrible marriage. We’ve been in a relationship for just over a year and this has been an issue from the start.

He has communicated insecurities several times around my male friendships, been moody if I don’t text him back inmediately, he has spoken disrespectfully when I haven’t called him back immediately when I’m out, etc. We even got into a nasty fight because I ended up thinking he was cheating on me.

It all came to head the other day after I went out for a coffee with a male coworker. We had a fight the night before, eventually he seemed okay with it, and the next morning he accused me of hiding my phone screen from him. That’s when I realized he will never trust me.

He said he doesn’t want us to continue harming each other and said it might be better if he left. I agreed, and by the end of the night he regretted ever saying anything. I told him he can stay, but he’s going to therapy.

I’ve tried doing things to make him feel more secure during the relationship such as not going out at nights, getting him to meet my friends, cutting my time short, I even gave him my phone password which I’m very unhappy with but he gave me his and kept pestering me about it (I never asked for it).

Everyone flocks to Costa Rica or Guatemala, but El Salvador has incredible diversity packed into a tiny country - you can surf in the morning and hike a volcano by afternoon.

Here’s what I’d recommend for an outdoor-focused trip:

**Days 1-2: Western beaches & surf**

El Tunco is the backpacker hub with decent surf and nightlife. But if you want fewer crowds, head to Playa El Sunzal or Las Flores on the east coast. The black sand takes getting used to, but the waves are consistent year-round.

**Days 3-4: Ruta de las Flores**

This mountain region has coffee plantations, waterfalls, and colorful colonial towns. Hike to Cascada de Los Tercios (basalt columns that look like Giant’s Causeway), visit Juayúa for the weekend food festival, and don’t miss the pupusas.

**Days 5-6: Volcano hiking**

Santa Ana Volcano is the crown jewel - turquoise crater lake at the summit. Start early (6am) to beat the heat. You can also do Izalco (the “lighthouse of the Pacific”) or Cerro Verde for easier trails with epic views.

**Days 7-8: Suchitoto**

This colonial town on Lake Suchitlán is perfect for bird watching and kayaking. Weekends have great art markets. It’s way more chill than the beach scene.

**Days 9-10: Beach time or Mayan ruins**

Either relax at a quieter beach (Playa El Cuco, Playa San Diego) or visit Joya de Cerén (the “Pompeii of the Americas”) and Tazumal ruins.

**Practical stuff:**

Safety: I won’t sugarcoat it - El Salvador has a reputation. Stick to tourist areas, don’t flash valuables, use Uber/trusted taxis, and you’ll be fine. The government has really improved safety in recent years. I’m a solo traveler and have never had issues.

Budget: $30-50/day is totally doable. Hostels run $10-15, local food is $3-5, buses are under $1.

Getting around: Rental car gives you freedom, but buses go everywhere if you’re patient. Some trailheads require 4WD.

*Best time:* November-April is dry season. May-October is rainy but greener and less crowded.

**What surprised me most:**

How friendly people are. Salvadorans are incredibly welcoming and proud to show off their country. Also, the food is better than expected - way more than just pupusas (though those are amazing).

I’m so incredibly lost right now and I feel like I’m being torn apart between two very contrasting outcomes and am struggling to find middle ground. This is going to be a long story so buckle up. 

Me (18F) and my BF (19M) went together to this DJ set last night (Jan 31) as a date night since we’ve been struggling to find time to go out as a couple. This was also going to mark the first time just the two of us went out since we were on the brink of breakup close to 2 weeks ago. Alcohol was involved but not enough to, what I thought, impact behavior and attitude especially on his part.

After getting inside the venue and splitting up to use the bathroom we get drinks together at the bar and the night is going really really well. We’re in love, we’re enjoying the music, so on and so forth. Things start to go downhill once we actually get out onto the floor where everyone’s dancing in front of the DJ. It’s crazy packed and he’s offering to lead me into the crowd which I happily accept since I do enjoy that experience and we get somewhat far and begin to dance. He’s behind me at this point and it grabbing onto my hips and we’re dancing normally until he soon after begins to start being really aggressive with how he’s moving my body. My purse is falling off my arm, I’m losing balance and bumping into the people around me (it was literally closer than shoulder to shoulder in this crowd), I’m stepping on peoples’ feet and having to apologize every two seconds so I turn around and ask him gently “could you please be more careful with how we’re dancing?” To which I’m met with the hostile response of “are you here with me or am I here with you?” Not knowing what this meant and reading on his face that he’s frustrated with something and keeping in mind he bought both of our tickets and covered the Ubers and drinks I respond with “I guess I’m here with you.” He goes on to say “exactly so shut the fuck up.” I’m completely taken aback at this point because he seems to have had such a major attitude change but, still wanting to enjoy the experience I accept and continue the same type of “dancing,” if you could even call it that, with him. 

Around 20-30 minutes later we leave the crowd to again use the restroom and get more drinks. He spills his drink all over his pants and has to buy a new one from the bar. After finishing we leave to go back onto the floor. There’s an open patio towards the left a little past the entrance and he begins walking towards it. Then he drops something so unexpected. “I’m leaving are you coming or not?” Of course I’m shocked and beyond confused as to what happened so I’m asking him what’s wrong and telling him we should stay since we had really only just gotten there and he says “I don’t like the way your acting.” He ends up voicing that he wants to just leave without me so he leaves, blocks my number, and Ubers home. So confused I go out to the main lobby to catch my breath and try to makeout the situation and ultimately end up spotting a friend from home who’s with her other friends and uber back with them. 

After getting back to my dorm, he lives around 10 doors down from me on the same floor, I change and go to his room to go talk to him. I find him sitting outside his room in the common area space with his female neighbor who I don’t have any close relations with and neither did he. Clearly confused since this is the same guy who just blocked me and left me alone at a random venue 20 minutes away from my building I ask “what’s going on here?” And she quickly stands up and says hurriedly “he was just explaining an internship to me,” and goes back into her room.

Back in his room I begin asking him why he left me, what I did wrong, and what I can do better in the future because at this point I’m just trying to find answers as to why his behavior did a full 180. He’s being extremely aggressive and rude, repeating that he didn’t like the way I was acting but refusing to explain to me what exactly I was doing, calling me names, and enforcing this idea that he broke up with me when he left me, something that was completely news to me. It literally feels like I’m talking to a different person. I’m trying to calm him down and get him to just talk to me so I’m rubbing his arms and back and trying to hold his hands and am met with 3 shoves to the ground or into his coffee table 3 separate times (but still doing the same thing, questioning and trying to calm). He tells me to leave his room and that we wants space but at this point I’m freaking out and sobbing and literally kneeling at his feet begging him to tell me what’s wrong and he tells me he’s calling the police on me. 

So he calls the police and explains that I won’t leave him alone so we later go to meet with officers and after they talk to him they ask for my side of the story. I explain everything I explained throughout this post to the officers and had been recording the conversation so I had proof of him pushing me. He was shortly after, without my knowledge put in cuffs and taken to the county jail. I then have to meet with a victim counselor and fill out a victim statement and the whole time I’m doing this I’m just so upset and confused as to why it had to escalate to this point. I didn’t find out until about 20 minutes before I was taken back to my dorm from the station that he was in jail. 

Since then he’s called me from jail and he’s back to his normal loving self. I want to forgive him, I know that in my heart. I have so much love and care for him and have an understanding that he has had anger issues in the past and alcohol has caused aggressive behavior like this to arise, but it’s a PTSD response from losing his dad at a pivotal time in his childhood and having to grow up fatherless with a mother who’s chronically ill. I know he had mental health problems and I know he can get better and I truly want to be with him when he does. I know I can see a future with him a long ways from now after we both get the help we need. But my rationale, my friends, my roommates they’re all looking at the facts of the situation and directly contradicting my feelings. I hate myself for wanting to continue our relationship with him but at the end of the day I wasn’t injured and after talking to him on the phone it’s hard not to fall back into that security of his kindness and love. He’s saying things like “it’s not your fault I’m here, I love you baby we’ll be ok” and all of these reassuring words and a part of me is still wanting to figure out what happened earlier and berate him with accusations of “why couldn’t you talk and act like this earlier? Why did it take you getting incarcerated to come back to your senses?” And then another part of me is just comfortable again, like water off a ducks back. I’m so incredibly dependent on him and he truly is someone who’s supported me in tremendous ways in the past, especially here in college. We were actually working on fixing my codependency on him because it’s caused serious problems in our relationship outside of this situation. During our break I was insanely depressed and wouldn’t eat, sleep all day and not go to class or do homework just because I felt so empty and purposeless being without him. Immediately after we reworked our relationship and got back together everything was normal again. I was excelling, I felt secure, etc. That’s another factor as to why a part of me doesn’t want things to end. I’m scared for myself. And I know people will be like “time heals all” and “you’re young you’ll meet someone else” but I’ve been in love with this kid for the past 6 years and right now in my life I don’t have time to be not ok. I’m taking 19 credits this semester and can’t be in a state where I’m unable to function properly. It’s like because of my dependency on him what’s best for my mental health is, not forgiving him, but continuing our relationship securely. 

I’m asking for advice on the situation because this forum is specifically based around codependent relationships and I believe some people who experience similar feelings can help. I cannot see a future without him and am, with maybe a bit of delusion involved, confident that he can get better with proper help and time. Some other information that might be useful is that I was diagnosed with BPD, he has displayed aggression such as this before especially when alcohol is involved, and no I do not consider him a threat to my safety. 

I apologize for the long post but believed it best to try to get all the important details across. ",2,1769977211.0,Codependency,7,0.62,False
