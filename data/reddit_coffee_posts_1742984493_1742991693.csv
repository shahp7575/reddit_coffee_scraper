1jkaeih,https://i.redd.it/y3e7h7ffd0re1.jpeg,"Competed in the Norwegian Cup Tasting Championship, placed 4th! Some takeaways + thoughts on the experience. ‚òï","Hi all, Lene from Team KaffeBox here. I just competed alongside my teammates from KaffeBox, B√∏rge and Tyler, in the official Norwegian Cup Tasters Championship, and while we‚Äôd run through the format a couple of times to get familiar with the **8 triangle setup**, we definitely weren‚Äôt in full-on training mode this time around.   
  
Still, we learned *a lot, and s*omehow I made it all the way to the final and ended up placing **4th,** which I‚Äôm honestly still a little shocked about. I thought I‚Äôd share a few takeaways for anyone curious or planning to compete in the future:

**Takeaways:**

* **You need to train with harder sets.** We realized pretty quickly that the practice we had been doing was more or less equivalent to the introducing rounds, so next time, we‚Äôll push ourselves more, using different ratios, mixing two coffees etc.
* **Practice in messy environments.** We have been cupping at the KaffeBox HQ, so in a calm, quiet space, but the competition was ofc full of movement, noise, and general chaos. The second I lost focus in the final, I got my cups wrong. Practicing in more ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù conditions is underrated and something I‚Äôll definitely work on.
* **Stay calm and focused.** Easier said than done, but the rounds where I stayed centered and didn‚Äôt overthink were the rounds I performed best in. 

It was a super fun experience, and a huge thanks to **SCA Norway and the sponsors** for making it all happen!   
  
Would love to hear how others approach training too üëá",1,1742991565.0,KaffeBox,0,1.0,False

Let's Talk!,"Ever felt like allergy season is turning into a never-ending saga? ü§ß Just when you think you‚Äôve dodged the pollen bullet, bam! It hits you like a freight train! This year, I've been battling sneezes and sniffles like they're my arch-nemesis. 

I recently came across some data suggesting that allergy seasons are, in fact, getting worse! Here‚Äôs what I learned:

- **Rising Temperatures:** Warm winters and longer summers mean more time for those pesky pollens to invade.
- **More Rain:** It sounds counterintuitive, but more rain leads to more plants growing‚Äîand more pollen to irritate our noses!
- **Climate Change:** It‚Äôs not just a buzzword; it‚Äôs affecting our air quality and extending pollen seasons.

So what do we do, right? Here are some tips that have helped me:

1. **Check Pollen Reports:** I always keep my eye on local pollen forecasts. Knowledge is power!
2. **Invest in Air Purifiers:** They can really help keep indoor air clean.
3. **Get Rid of Dust Bunnies:** Regular cleaning is essential to avoid those sneaky triggers hiding in your home.

And let‚Äôs not forget humor! Sometimes you just have to laugh at how ridiculous it can be‚Äîlike when you think your morning coffee is your saving grace and then your nose starts running at the first whiff of grass! ‚òïü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

So, my fellow allergy warriors, **how are you handling this allergy season? Any tips or tricks to share?** Let‚Äôs band together and conquer our sniffly foes!

His lips curled into a smile, elongated spikes protruding from gums stained crimson. ‚ÄúYou wanted to tell me something that night,‚Äù He giggled, the full wrath of the Trickster coming out. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want to tell me? Come on Sammy, spit it out.‚Äù

Sam was struggling. 

He coughed up writhing scarlet, and I realized, my heart in my throat, that Kaz was *forcing* the words from his mouth. 

""You were‚Ä¶ *with* him."" Sam whispered, spluttering up slimy red lumps. 

Kaz chuckled. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶.? Speak! I command you!‚Äù he mocked. ‚ÄúCome on, why so quiet, hmm? You were quite the vocal one when you split my skin apart.‚Äù

Sam screamed, his cry hollowing me out, an animal-like wail. 

""Every‚Ä¶ fucking‚Ä¶ day. He was all you talked about.‚Äù Sam dropped onto his stomach, and I could see the words *physically* bleeding from his lips.

‚ÄúWe had dinner, talked, and hung out, and *he* was what came out of your mouth. You thought you were invincible,"" he choked. ""That you could have me *and* him, and you were so fucking‚Ä¶ sly about it. You were greedy, Charlie! You were fucking cruel!‚Äù 

When Sam lurched forward, coughing, beads of red dripping down his chin, I felt my body stiffen.

Kaz didn't move, dark eyes glued to Sam.

Sam didn't stop. I don't think he could anymore. 

His body was limp and wrong, his arms by his sides, rivulets of red running down his chin. 

The words running from his mouth were intimate and personal, and *forced* from his lips. ""And that night, I came to break things off with you,‚Äù he whispered, violently retching up each word. 

‚ÄúI wanted to tell you I was done. With your games. That you were screwing with my head and making me fucking crazy!"" 

He broke into a sob, which turned into a laugh. ""But you didn't even answer the door. *He* did.‚Äù

His grin widened, scarlet slew beading down his neck. ""It would always be *him*.""

His eyes found Kaz, narrowing. ""And I fucking hated you for it.""

Kaz grinned. ‚ÄúOoh, toxic. I *love* it.‚Äù

""I had an‚Ä¶ excuse."" 

This time, his words were unnatural, violently torn from his mouth, ripping open his lips. Sam swayed back and forth, a childish giggle escaping him. 

""When I lost you, I finally had an excuse to torture the devil wearing your face, and I actually‚Ä¶ I *actually* enjoyed it.‚Äù

Risking a glance at him, I knew Sam wasn't lying. 

He *meant* each cut he'd sliced into Kaz. Every puncture through his flesh. 

It was his fucked up way of justifying his torture‚Äì when in reality, he had hurt him.

And even now, after actively fighting to save Kaz, Sam was still convinced he was a *Devil*. 

Kaz let out a breathy laugh, and it was so human‚Äîhis head tipping to the side, his eyes rolling, like he was laughing at a bad joke. But then I saw the inhuman twitch in his lips.

""Wait,"" he murmured. ""You think I‚Ä¶ loved him?""

He grabbed Sam by the cheek, forcing him to look at him, his grin widening.

""I did,"" The Trickster whispered, dragging his teeth across Sam's neckline.

""That's what you wanted to hear, right? That I was always in love with him? That you were just a‚Äî"" 

He broke into a manic giggle, ""a fucking distraction, Sammy? That I reveled in the touch of his skin? That I fucked him to mark him as *mine*?‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Sam whispered. 

I had never witnessed the true unraveling of a human mind before.

Until now.

I watched the light fizzle from Sam‚Äôs eyes, his jaw going slack.

His body went limp, swaying to the left before crumpling to the ground. He curled into the fetal position, eyes vacant, choking up slithering scarlet. 

Before I could speak, Kaz stepped forward, crouched over Sam‚Äôs trembling body, and ripped his spine from his back‚Äîstarting gently before yanking it free with a violent tug. Sam‚Äôs body flopped with a wet smack, his entrails pooling onto the concrete.

""It‚Äôs true, Sammy,"" Kaz sighed, waving the bloody vertebrae. ""I liked you. But you weren‚Äôt him. And I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sorry for that.""

Kaz's gaze flashed to me, curious, and something in my chest... jerked.

I could feel them‚Äîwords, tangled thoughts.

Intimate thoughts I kept down, kept suppressed, creeping into my mouth in a bloody mouthful of sour saliva. 

My throat contorted, my mouth prying open, like my roommate was physically forcing it open.

I don't regret what I did to you.

I don't regret what I did to you.

I don‚Äôt rEGRET what I DID to YOU.

Kaz smirked, but he let go, letting the words trickle back down.

""Anything you want to tell me, Nin?"" he asked.

Yes.

The words were there, choking me, hemorrhaging my throat.

They were wrong, selfish, and yet so human. They were mine.

Still, I knew his answer.

Kaz was playing with me‚Äîof course he was.

He let the words slide back down.

""Thalvi,"" he said, the moon dripping from his tongue. ""Looks like I won the game!""

He yanked me up, pulling me close, his mouth dancing across the bridge of my ear.

""After everything you've done to us,"" he murmured, chuckling, ""do you really think you're even in his line of sight?‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt‚Äîreply, and he squeezed my fingers in his.

‚ÄúWalk with me.‚Äù

In the corner of my eye, Sam‚Äôs body was already rewriting itself into existence.

The irony of Sam Fuller also being a ‚Äòdevil‚Äô was almost comedic. 

‚ÄúI need your help,‚Äù Kaz said, pulling me up stone steps leading to the town hall entrance.

‚ÄúWe have a‚Ä¶ situation with the King,‚Äù he announced, twisting around to face me. 

‚ÄúNow, it's usually easy to re-educate a human mind and fill them with her light.‚Äù Kaz said. I had to guess the cult was no doubt using his intelligence. ‚ÄúHowever, sometimes‚Äîrarely‚Äîthe human mind will‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say‚Ä¶‚Äù he clucked his tongue. 

‚ÄúFight back.‚Äù

Loud, thudding footsteps caught me off guard.

Large wooden doors were violently thrown open, and a shadow stepped, or rather stumbled, from pristine white light, crashing straight into me.

The first thing I saw was the grotesque crown glued to his skull, its jagged prongs slicing into his forehead. 

Thick brown curls hung in soaking strands, clinging to half-lidded eyes that blinked rapidly as if I were a hallucination. 

He was both human and not, his skin ice cold, almost slimy against mine, clammy arms immediately wrapping around me. 

His back was mutilated, his spine protruding through ugly flaps of flesh, festering with infection.

The remnants of a light blue hospital gown clung to straining muscles. 

It was only when I really stared at him, really took him in, that I realized, my heart diving into my throat. Poppy was right. The Bolivia House kids couldn't be saved. 

I could see where his crown had been forced directly into the meat of his brain, reddish sludge-stained moonlight seeping down his temples. The reluctant King, I thought, my chest aching. He was still fighting.

Rowan Beck stared at me, moonlit eyes blinking rapidly, struggling to take me in.

‚ÄúNin?‚Äù he whispered in a sob, his lips parting in a silent cry.

I saw that curl in his lip, that ignition of hatred in his eyes. 

With his memories restored, he knew what I did to him. 

He staggered back, unsure where to go. Trapped. 

In his eyes, I was still the monster. 

I opened my mouth to reply when his body jolted violently, contorting, sending him to his knees, screaming. 

Guards, members of the cult, were already grabbing Rowan, pulling him to his feet, and dragging him back inside.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù His voice shuddered, a soft moan sharpening into a cry. 

He kicked and screamed, his body betraying him, weak and wrong, while his head thrashed, eyes wild. 

‚ÄúGet your fucking hands off me!‚Äù he shrieked, something snapping in his expression, a feral contortion overtaking him. 

His lips curled back, moonlight drowning his eyes, and in a blur, his body jerked violently, elongated teeth snapping like an animal, tearing off a guard‚Äôs head.

He was free for maybe a second, crawling back on his hands and knees, territorial. 

Like a cornered animal, he backed away, eyes frantic, a low whine escaping his throat when the cult members swarmed him. 

Rowan lunged toward me, but they caught him, forcing him onto a surgical bed, his struggling wrists and ankles strapped down.

‚ÄúThe King is very sick, Nin,‚Äù Kaz spoke over Rowan‚Äôs howl once an IV drip was forced into his writhing wrist.

He snarled, his contorting body immediately shoved onto stained pillows.

‚ÄúLet me go.‚Äù he whimpered, his voice breaking, seeping into a whine when he tried to sit up, snapping at his attackers.

Kaz stepped over the threshold, pulling me with him.

‚ÄúHe currently has perforations inside his brain, which means, yes, in a way, our goddess is leaking out of him, temporarily awakening the assimilated vessel.‚Äù

‚ÄúKaz.‚Äù Rowan snarled. He was forced onto his back, his face lodged against soiled bed sheets. His body arched violently before slamming back onto the bed.

‚ÄúYou're a fucking asshole and a traitor,‚Äù he gritted out, needles and tubes being forced into him. He fought against them, razor-sharp teeth grazing the pillows. ‚ÄúGet a hold of yourself! You‚Äôre being controlled‚Äîmmmph mph hhhhhmm!‚Äù

Kaz nodded to me with a smile. For now, I guessed, he was King. ‚ÄúKeep him company, and comfortable, of course,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs vessel must be in a subdued state before we reassimilate.‚Äù

Reassimilate?

Kaz‚Äôs words tangled in my mind, confusion clouding my thoughts.

I had never heard of reassimilating vessels before.

However, this was luck I wasn‚Äôt expecting, and I was going to take full advantage of it.

Once the doors were shutting on a group of guards led by Kaz, I was at Rowan‚Äôs bedside in three strides.

I knew the Rowan in front of me was a different person from the boy I had last seen.

This Rowan knew the truth about his first death and my cruel sacrifice, what I had done to him. He knew about his murder.

I could still see that distrust sparkling in half-glazed-over eyes.

He was trembling, his body still jerking left to right.

His mouth had been cruelly taped shut, dazed eyes glaring at me.

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself, reaching out and entangling his clammy fingers with mine.

‚ÄúMmmhmm mhm Mhmmm mhmmm mpphmm?‚Äù

Instead of responding, I slid the knife I‚Äôd hidden out of my pocket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get her out of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmmhmm?!‚Äù

Reaching forward, I ripped the tape off his mouth.

‚ÄúOw!‚Äù Rowan hissed. He tried to straighten up, his restraints yanking his squirming body back. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was in the cult that sacrificed you,‚Äù I whispered.

He nodded slowly, unfocused eyes flickering. 

‚ÄúI was right.‚Äù he averted his gaze. ‚ÄúApologize.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt resist a dry laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for sacrificing you to my mother‚Äôs evil cult.‚Äù

Rowan stuck out his bottom lip, a true man-child. ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

He still didn‚Äôt look at me when I brushed sticky strands of hair from his eyes. 

But when his gaze finally caught mine, maybe by accident, his expression seemed to soften. 

He leaned closer, almost toppling off the bed. ‚ÄúYou killed me, and now you‚Äôre trying to fix it,‚Äù he sighed, his breath dancing across my cheek. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that makes you worse, or just fucking pathetic.‚Äù

I found myself paralyzed, with him so close, his eyes searching mine. His breath was warm and steady against my lips. 

Slowly, he leaned in, his fingers skimming my cheek, turning me toward him.

The kiss felt both right and wrong, especially since his heart belonged to someone else.

But it was warm, fleeting, sending my thoughts into a tailspin.

I pulled away when he didn‚Äôt, my breath catching.

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

His snort took me off guard, and I remembered he was an insufferable asshole. ‚ÄúNah. You're sorry you liked it.‚Äù

I was seriously considering taping his mouth shut.

But then he kissed me again, this time softer, gentler, his fingers cradling my cheek, tip-toeing down my arm and grasping my wrist, pulling me closer. 

I almost dropped my knife, giving in, falling into him. 

I almost gave in to that selfish part of me secretly enjoying the light drowning his eyes. 

When he pulled away, his eyes were warm. 

Human. 

‚ÄúNin?‚Äù

His voice was soft, his lips inches from mine. 

‚ÄúI forgive you, you know.‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou were protecting your brother.‚Äù

I couldn't look at him.

Instead of losing myself, I focused on the ritual. 

In the past, perhaps there was something between us. 

But it was clear, from my memories, and even presently, I wasn't‚Ä¶ *good* for him. 

I wanted to believe in reincarnation. 

Maybe *next* time we would find each other, fate entwining us, bringing us together.

Yanking up what was left of his sleeve, a shiver slipped down my spine. I could just about make out the phantom word I'd sliced under his elbow, etched into his skin. I didn't realize how cruel I was, how painful the marking scarring his flesh was.

Maybe‚Ä¶ *not*. 

Maybe in *all* realities, and all versions of us, I would always be a stain on his soul.

Gently taking his left palm, I glimpsed Nathur.

Rowan flinched when I pulled up the material of his hospital gown, revealing his heart.

‚ÄúWoah! Easy! Your hands are cold!‚Äù He folded his arms stubbornly. ‚ÄúYou're going to do something stupid. I can tell.‚Äù

Ignoring him, I focused on Thalix.

I started with his hand, slicing the blade through the word.

Moonlight was supposed to seep out, bleeding from the entrance point. But all that did pool out was buzzing static, slick on the knife and running down his palm.

Something slimy wound its way up my throat. 

I had known about Rowan‚Äôs ability to replicate ever since I discovered my roommate‚Äôs secret. 

I had watched him die in the car wreck, his body twisted like a pretzel.

Realization hit me, cruel and unforgiving, as I retracted the blade.

The severing ritual only worked when performed on the original body.

That‚Äôs what Jonas said.

And through this whole ordeal, the Rowan beside me had been nothing more than his static replica.

His shadow.

‚ÄúYou are funny, Nin.‚Äù

I shuffled back as he sat up on the bed, pulling his arms free from the restraints, plucking out the tubes feeding into him.

I jumped to my feet, my heart in my throat, as he dove off the bed, stretching.

The King regarded me with a curious smile, one brow raised. ‚ÄúHoles perforating my brain.‚Äù He mimicked Rowan‚Äôs voice.

His cruel gaze held me in place.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ naive. Even for you.‚Äù His lips split into a grin. 

‚ÄúYou are fascinating! Honestly, you have me well and truly captivated. I thought for sure you would realize that the man you so hopelessly fawn over would never, and I mean ever, and trust me, I'm inside his head. I‚Äôm entangled in his thoughts, his memories, his shameless fantasies he keeps to himself‚Ä¶‚Äù He chuckled. 

‚ÄúNina, surely by now, you know this man is like a leech. He attaches himself to the people closest to him because he doesn‚Äôt want to be left alone. Rowan is a parasite.‚Äù

The King mocked a pout. 

‚ÄúYou thought differently, hmm? Oh, but what if I told you the truth? Would you rethink your choice to fall for an empty shell?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a feeling she would *fall* for it.‚Äù

Imogen stood in the doorway, an amused smile curled on her lips. 

She embraced her Queen status, draped in a cloak of adorned human flesh and blood sculpting her frame. 

Blonde streaks of hair hung in moonlit eyes, cherry lips curved into a triumphant smile. ‚ÄúNin is quite brainless.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrainless, thoughtless, everything-less.‚Äù The King studied me with amusement. He leaned forward, his breath tickling my face. 

‚ÄúI want to‚Ä¶ show you something, Nina.‚Äù

He grabbed my shoulders, escorting me from the room, through a wooden door, and down cold, concrete steps.

The King‚Äôs grip was unrelenting. ‚ÄúI'm‚Ä¶ curious,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúIs being so oblivious a human thing, or a you thing?‚Äù

I didn't respond, my body stiff, my eyes glued in front of me.

There was a flickering orange light getting brighter and brighter.

‚ÄúCorrect me if I'm wrong, but you've known about my ability and your ability to be copied, rendered, and molded into her perfect soldiers, with endless bodies made of static that can never be hurt, never truly die.‚Äù He hummed. 

‚ÄúBut you chose to turn a blind eye. When really, Nin,‚Äù his fingernails were cruel, slicing into the bare flesh of my shoulder, ‚Äúyou should have been asking yourself why. Like, why are we replicating?‚Äù 

He mocked my voice. ‚ÄúWhy do we keep coming back? When you had the answer all along!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, you did see me. I trickled from your friend‚Äôs flesh, your blade slicing me from him. You freed me. You allowed her to pull me from the flesh and mold me.‚Äù

He smirked. ‚ÄúWell, that was a secondary version of me. I was the very first. The first shadow peeled from Rowan Beck‚Äôs heart.‚Äù

I caught his smile flickering in the candlelight. 

We descended the stairs, leading into a stone tunnel filled with candles. 

I noticed moonlight spilling across the floor, scalding my feet as I was forced into its path. But I couldn't stop myself. 

My body was hers. My thoughts, hers to twist.

Cult members stood, making way for us. Mom was among them, her eyes wide, smile proud.

I passed her, and her lips broke out into a grin. I'm so proud of you she mouthed, her eyes filled, twisted with lunacy.

The King clung to me like I was his bride, linking our arms. 

‚ÄúI want to introduce you to some‚Ä¶ friends of mine,‚Äù he murmured. 

‚ÄúThey've been excited to see you again.‚Äù

Moonlight led me, and I was transfixed, almost dancing towards it.

Towards her.

The room I found myself in was filled, drowned in her.

So bright, my vision burned. But I couldn't move my arms.

She was singing in my head, gleeful, her melody echoing in my skull. When her light started to let up, figures bled from the blur.

I thought they were cult members at first, but they weren't standing.

Instead, three bodies were tied back to back, drifting in her light, as if preserved in her lumine.

They were human, so painfully human, blood still staining their clothes, eternally frozen in stardust that glittered on their cheeks like diamonds beneath heavenly light. 

Something squirmed, coiling around my spine when the King strode over to one of them and, with the toe of his boot, rolled the body onto its back. 

I had known who they were the moment I stepped inside. 

But my mind didn‚Äôt fully register it until I saw the gaping cavern in his chest, where I had cruelly torn out his heart.

His head lolled forward, tousled curls falling into his face. Rowan.

Kaz‚Äôs gunshot wound stuck out, ugly and cavernous, his head resting on Rowan‚Äôs shoulder. Imogen was still dressed in blood-soaked, fluffy pajamas, tangled blonde curls glued to her face.

It was a mockery, a combinement, of their first and second deaths. 

When I carved out their hearts, and when their outlines were carved. 

But if they were here, if the original bodies of the Bolivia House residents were here.

I took a step back, gooseflesh prickling across the back of my neck.

Where was I?

‚ÄúNythea has always been able to control and mold our second skins,‚Äù the King said. ‚ÄúShe has bled inside our silhouettes, our outlines, twisting us into her playthings.‚Äù

His voice echoed in my head as I found myself stumbling toward my roommates.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù The King continued, when I fell to my knees. I barely felt the impact.

She was already singing inside my head. Louder.

I crawled forward, and she let me, let me lay him on my lap and grasp his cheeks, cradling them. He was so cold. His skin was almost hardened, slick with moonlight.

‚ÄúWhat if she reached further?‚Äù Behind me, the King fell to his knees next to me, almost in prayer. ‚ÄúWhat if Nythea walked on this earth once more? Not as a shadow, a puppeteer, but reborn skin and bones?‚Äù

I barely felt him.

There was only her.

Singing to me from the skylight, trickling into my blood, my veins, entwining around my bones. I felt stone-cold hands press something into mine. I felt the blade prick my palm, and I knew exactly what I had to do. She was so soft, so gentle, coaxing my hand when it sliced through the first word.

Luhar.

This time, I saw it, reveled in it, in the trickling moonlight flowing from the wound.

‚ÄúSever her light from us,‚Äù The King‚Äôs lips found my ear as I dragged my blade through Nathur. ‚ÄúAnd let her reach them.‚Äù

Yes.

Her voice choked my mouth, her melody suffocating my throat.

‚ÄúIn flesh and blood and bone,‚Äù he whispered.

Part of me was resisting. Jonas never told me about the end of the severing ritual, so I looked for it myself. The one performing the ritual must be the exact same person who performed the binding, and as punishment for failing an offering, the one enacting the severing must be sacrificed.

So, in a way, I guess I was finally getting my karma.

Still, the moon held me in a soft, and yet unbreakable grip. She had my mind, my body, my blood and bones, and, like I was dancing, unable to stop, unable to steady myself, I stabbed the blade into Thalix.

I watched his skin splinter apart, rupturing, moonlight pouring out.

And she was so beautiful.

I held out my own hands to touch her, to cup her into my palms.

‚ÄúYou intrigue me, Nin,‚Äù the King murmured. ‚ÄúYou came in here as a player, and have inevitably become a pawn.‚Äù 

He tipped his head, curious. 

‚ÄúBut you don't look like you regret it. Which is‚Ä¶ well, it's interesting.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúNow, I'm inside your head. Your oh-so-naive thoughts. You're hoping everything will go back to normal‚Äîeven in a world without you in it.‚Äù

He leaned closer, his face glitching in and out of view, unraveling as moonlight expanded around us, seeping from my roommates. 

‚ÄúYou're selfish, but you always have been. You want to believe that despite allowing her light to reach human flesh and bone, they will be alive‚Äîand maybe you're correct.‚Äù

His lips found my ear once again.

‚ÄúBut what exactly will they be, hmm? You can't preserve a heartless human being inside moonlight for a concerning amount of time and not expect them to be a little‚Ä¶ wrong.‚Äù His voice turned into a sing-song.

‚ÄúBut. You. Don't. Care.‚Äù He chuckled. 

‚ÄúAll you care about is burying your guilt‚Äî *her* guilt that lives inside you. You've always known, at the back of your mind, that you belong with us‚Äì inside the dark, where she twists us into outlines‚Äì her mockeries of human beings in the light.‚Äù

He was right.

I didn't care what state they were in‚Äì as long as they were alive.

And above me, the sky grew lighter, a painful glare taking over the moon‚Äôs glow.

The sun.

Sunlight exploded through the room, basking every corner, drowning me.

But she was already inside my head. She had already won. 

With a knowing smile, the King flickered from my line of sight, static creeping back into the shadows as sunlight consumed him. 

I had so many questions to ask, but already, my fingers were crumbling away, bleeding into static nothingness that pooled on the ground. I waited for the moon to stitch me back up, like she always did. I was hers, after all. 

I was made up of her stars. I had never been Nina Lockhart. 

I was her outline‚Äî living a grieving woman‚Äôs fantasy. 

This time, the moon laughed lightly inside my head.

There was no reason to bring me back. I had served my purpose.

I had died so many times and taken advantage of each one.

Because what was going to happen when the darkness didn't spit me out? Where would I go? Would I continue, living in a stranger's shadow, or find my own peace?

Rest, child.

The moon laid me down beside my dead housemates, and I was grateful for her phantom fingers stroking through my hair.

Instead of watching myself bleed away into nothing, into stars that would twinkle out and disappear, I lay my head on Rowan‚Äôs ice-cold chest, wrapping myself around his moonlit corpse. 

I watched the sunrise across the horizon bleeding into daylight, rays of gold spilling across his grey skin, spider webbing across the cavern in his chest. 

And let her take me *home*.

‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶ 

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

The rhythm was steady, slightly off-kilter, slamming into my skull.

I could sense every falter‚Äîthe bulging, fleshy thing caught between her ribcage, pumping blood through veins‚Äîevery breath that labored and heaved, slipping through slightly parted lips. 

And from them, I could smell‚Ä¶ chocolate soaked in cigarette smoke, the scent of sex seeping from pores, and the unmistakable stink of‚Ä¶

Glimpsing tiny white hairs clinging to the woman‚Äôs coat, I felt myself retract slowly.

Cat.

‚ÄúUm, hello?‚Äù 

The voice splintered through my thoughts, dragging me back to reality. 

Clinking coffee cups and quiet chatter, my colleague not-so-subtly bumping me with her hip. ‚ÄúDude, you're daydreaming again.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey! are you staring at my fucking breasts?‚Äù

Blinking rapidly, I focused on my latest customer, fashioning a smile.

‚ÄúWelcome to Coffee Grounds,‚Äù I drawled. ‚ÄúThe best grounds in town! What can I get for you?‚Äù

The woman‚Äîa junior, maybe‚Äîcurled her lip, her gaze raking me up and down. 

Patrons had been doing that a lot lately. 

Every customer stared at me like I was a freakin‚Äô zoo attraction.

I figured I had something on my face, but no, apparently, it was just my fucking face.

‚ÄúIced coffee.‚Äù 

She leaned forward against the counter, exposing as much cleavage as possible. 

I was too busy staring at the cat hairs clinging to her coat. 

‚ÄúName?‚Äù I asked, grabbing an empty cup.

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Her lips curved into a smile. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name? You‚Äôre a senior, right? Do you have a girlfriend?‚Äù

I ignored her, making her drink. ‚ÄúDo you, by any chance, own a cat?‚Äù

She leaned back, brows furrowing. ‚ÄúHuh? Yeah.‚Äù She grinned. ‚ÄúWait, how did you know?‚Äù

Slapping a lid on her iced coffee, I handed it over, careful not to touch her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt own a cat,‚Äù I muttered, swiping my hands on my apron. ‚ÄúCats, like, seriously fucking suck. I mean, have you seen them? They're like‚Ä¶ overgrown rats.‚Äù

The woman backed away, scowling. ‚ÄúGross.‚Äù

I had to agree with her. I‚Äôd forgotten to shave, my hair was sticky and falling over my eyes, and I couldn‚Äôt smile to save my life.

I was peak sewer rat‚Äîyet somehow, every customer gave me a second glance, their eyes widening like they saw something in me that I didn‚Äôt. 

It was embarrassing having to snap them out of their weird trance; they just stood there, swaying. 

I couldn't resist a grin when the girl tutted. ‚ÄúYou're a freak.‚Äù

I offered her a sarcastic wave. 

‚ÄúThanks for coming, ma‚Äôam! Have a *great* day.‚Äù 

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù

My next customer had a familiar face‚Äîovergrown sandy blonde curls tied into a ponytail and his usual scowl.

Sam Fuller stood at the front of the queue, arms folded, eyes narrowed, like a disappointed father.

Jeez. The guy looked like a divorced dad of two, with some seriously bad eye circles.

‚ÄúI see you're scaring customers again.‚Äù I saw the slightest uptick in his lip that was maybe a smile. ‚ÄúJust an Americano, please.‚Äù

Propping my body against the counter, I settled him with a polite smile.

‚ÄúDo you *ever*  sleep, Sammy?‚Äù

Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúI had two hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat's almost a nap! Congratulations.‚Äù

Grabbing an empty cup, I scribbled his name. ‚ÄúSoo, you're stalking me at work too? That's low. Charlie's not here, bro.‚Äù

Sam didn‚Äôt even blink, his face softening. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôre you doing, Rowan?‚Äù

""Fine."" I fixed his drink painfully slowly, screwing on the lid with deliberate care. ""Just like the last *thousand* times you asked.‚Äù

Sliding over his coffee, I casually leaned my fist on my chin, elbow on counter. 

‚ÄúIs this about me and Kaz? Because I've told you, it's just like‚Ä¶‚Äù  I blew a raspberry. ‚ÄúI don't know, like a roommates thing‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not,‚Äù he said, too quickly. 

I arched my brow. ‚ÄúSounds like it *is*.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs lip curled. ‚ÄúRowan, can you just listen to me for, like, five seconds?‚Äù

I folded my arms. ‚ÄúIf I *must*.‚Äù

Sam twisted around quickly, scanning the store before leaning over the counter, his eyes darkening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a full moon tonight.‚Äù

I took his cash, stuffing it in the register. ‚ÄúIs that seriously what you wanted to tell me?‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan, there are people who remember what happened,‚Äù he whispered. 

‚ÄúTown Council members. They're coming after you guys.‚Äù Sam lowered his voice. ‚ÄúRowan, you three need to get *out* of town.‚Äù

I slammed the register shut. ‚ÄúWell, shit,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúThat's like, seeeeeriously fucking bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight?!‚Äù Sam whispered, his face lighting up. ‚ÄúLook, I know we‚Äôve never seen eye to eye‚Äì because of the whole devil thing, but I still give a fuck about you, y‚Äôknow? And I still don't know what happened! I just woke up and everything was just normal? The sun was back, and‚Ä¶ and I couldn't find‚Äì‚Äù

I leaned forward, cutting him off. ‚ÄúSam.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúI say this with love,‚Äù I said, cradling his cheeks. ‚ÄúPlease get psychiatric help.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs face crumpled. He pulled away. ‚ÄúYou think I'm fucking crazy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause you sound like a nut job,‚Äù I managed through a gritted smile. I flashed a grin at a woman standing behind him. 

‚ÄúHe's an escaped asylum patient, ma‚Äôam! I've never seen this person before in my life.‚Äù

Sam looked desperate, suddenly lunging across the counter. I got a whiff of him, visceral and wrong, sending my body arching back, my limbs working against me, nails digging into my fists. He was‚Ä¶ too close. Sam smelled like‚Ä¶ like rot. Like he‚Äôd been sitting in a fucking grave.

""Rowan, you need to listen to me,‚Äù  he hissed, his tone growing cold. 

‚ÄúHaven't you noticed? *Everyone* is looking at you.‚Äù he jerked his head behind him. ‚ÄúThe woman in the red coat?‚Äù 

I followed his gaze, glimpsing a smartly dressed woman in a suit and red jacket standing at the back of the queue. Sam leaned closer. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs one of the new town council members, and the wife of the guy you three fucking ripped *apart*.‚Äù

His eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of people willing to get their hands dirty to rid this town of devils, and you, Kaz and Imogen are at the top of their list. You need to run, Rowan.‚Äù

Something ice cold trickled down my spine, but I shook it off. I couldn't resist a snort. In the corner of my eye, I noticed the woman in the red coat make a swift exit. 

‚ÄúThe literary genius strikes again.‚Äù I leaned over the counter, settling him with a patient smile. ‚ÄúLook. I get it. You're pissed Kaz dumped your ass. But the weird story shit has to stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice dropped into a growl. 

‚ÄúI've got *customers*, Sammy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThanks for reminding me that moon cycles exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúLock your doors and windows,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúClose your curtains. Do not let her in.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're losing it, Sam.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeck, I'm being serious!‚Äù

This time, I kept my distance.

‚ÄúSo am I.‚Äù I jerked my head towards the door. ‚ÄúNow shoo.‚Äù

Sam curled his lip. ‚ÄúOkay, answer me this,‚Äù he came close, way too close for comfort, his breath tickling my cheeks. ‚ÄúHow many roommates do you have, Rowan?‚Äù

‚Äî

That question hung heavy in my mind. 

At the end of my shift, I was cleaning tables when a looming figure startled me.

""One iced coffee, please.""

Kaz hung over me with a warm smile. He looked good‚Äîwinter coat over a band tee and jeans, bedhead hair nestled under a baseball cap. As usual, Imogen Prairie was attached to him, scowling, her blonde curls peeking from beneath a woolly hat.

Kaz was effortlessly cool, easily sliding next to me. His breath in my ear stunk of weed. ‚ÄúDid Sam, by any chance, pay you a visit today?‚Äù

I snorted, enjoying his amused eyes. ‚ÄúWhat do *you* think?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep away from him,‚Äù Kaz murmured. ‚ÄúI know he's my ex, but he's giving serious stalker vibes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah,‚Äù I muttered, scrubbing at a milkshake stain. ‚ÄúThe guy has clearly lost it.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs expression twisted. ‚ÄúThe moon thing?‚Äù

I twisted and grabbed his shoulders, settling him with a smile. ‚ÄúThe *moon* thing.‚Äù

Kaz groaned, running his hand through his hair. ‚ÄúIgnore him. I can talk to my uncle, if, you know, he refuses to leave us alone.‚Äù

I couldn't resist a laugh. ‚ÄúI didn't mean put a *hit* on him!‚Äù

Kaz scrunched up his nose. Adorable. ‚ÄúRowan, you know that's not what I meant.‚Äù 

That was *definitely* what he meant. 

""You take way too many shifts,"" Immie announced when I leapt over the counter to fix their drinks. 

She followed me, sliding onto a stool. ""I thought we were hanging out? There's a new Korean restaurant that opened. You get to cook your own meat!""

‚ÄúI also haven't eaten,‚Äù Kaz's lips curled into a smirk, casually leaning over the counter. 

‚ÄúOne of *everything*, please, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm closing in ten minutes, asshole.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a coffee.‚Äù His gaze found the menu behind me. ‚ÄúCould I get a sandwich too?‚Äù

I managed a grin through my teeth. ‚ÄúYou're testing me, Del-a-croix. What *kind* of sandwich?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurprise me.‚Äù

After ten minutes of constructing a Scooby-Doo style sandwich fit for a stoner, I plonked it down, alongside an iced coffee.

‚ÄúHappy?‚Äù 

He bit into it with a grin, getting mayo all over his mouth. 

‚ÄúNeeds more lettuce.‚Äù

I fought to stay nonchalant, pressing my lips against a laugh. ‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù

Imogen was making eyes at the boba machine behind me.

I folded my arms. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Imogen stuck out her bottom lip like a toddler, but I wasn't falling for her games. 

""I'm not making boba.‚Äù I bonked her on the head with a plastic cup. ‚ÄúIt's almost 6.‚Äù

She gestured wildly to the monstrosity sticking out of Kaz‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúYou made Kaz a turkey sandwich!‚Äù 

I folded my arms. ‚ÄúYes. Because I *like* him.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù Kaz mumbled through a mouthful. ‚ÄúMake her the damn boba.‚Äù

I shook my head, ignoring Immie‚Äôs puppy dog eyes. Her little head tilt, bottom lip jutting out. ‚ÄúYou can't bribe me by looking cute.‚Äù

I did make her boba in the end. That girl was a nuisance wrapped in thrifted Prada.

After I locked up the store, we set off home. The sun was setting. 

I didn't mean to say it, it just came out, my head nestled on Kaz‚Äôs shoulder. 

‚ÄúDo we have another roommate?‚Äù

‚Äî

I wasn't sure how I ended up at a rooftop party later that night‚Äì and still, that question wouldn't leave me alone. 

Did we have another roommate? 

I was perched on the edge of an illuminated pool, dangling my feet in warm water lapping at my toes. The pool was shaped like a dick. Because of course it was.

""Sooo, I saw you at the bar.""

The fluorescent blue was so‚Ä¶ beautiful, like the water itself was trying to coax me in. I imagined diving in, sinking deep, deep down, into the blue, dragged down into its depths. A girl's reflection grazed the surface.

‚ÄúCongratulations.‚Äù I said, scooting back a little. ‚ÄúYou have functioning eyes.‚Äù

She laughed. ‚ÄúAre you here alone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

""That's too bad.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou're the first person I've met who willingly wears a trench coat to a pool party.‚Äù

I couldn't resist a snort. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only one here with a brain,‚Äù I said, kicking my legs in the water.

""Where's your other half?""

I nodded toward the pool at Kaz and Imogen, getting seriously intimate on a beach towel, wrapped around each other.

""Ooh, halves! I like them!‚Äù 

She was in the corner of my eye, her reflection glittering in the ripples. 

Strawberry blonde curls, a smile pricking on her lips. ""Why aren't you joining them?""

I shrugged. The reality was, I hated my body. I hated wearing swimming trunks. I still had feelings that were far more than ‚Äòit's just a roommate thing‚Äù. 

However, the two of them were actually pretty fucking cool with playing hard to get. 

Imogen was a free spirit, and Kaz vowed to never date again. 

Leaning back on my hands, I tilted my head, admiring the sky.

""I'd‚Ä¶ rather fuck them privately.‚Äù

She surprised me with a snort. ""I mean, same.‚Äù

After a while of staring at the surface of the pool, I realized I was following a white light dancing across the ripples in the water. 

I watched it bounce onto a guy's glasses, and then someone's glass, igniting in a woman's eyes. It reminded me of a spider's tendril, expanding across the surface of the pool. I noticed my head was slowly tipping back, my gaze tracking the sky. 

‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù the girl asked. 

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù Leaning further back, I yawned. ‚ÄúI'm Rowan, by the way.‚Äù

When I didn't get a response, I turned to the empty spot next to me. 

Oh. 

There was nobody there. 

I looked twice, even twisted around and pulled my legs from the pool. 

The girl was nowhere to be seen, and from the concerned look on a guy sprawled on a pool floaty, I had been talking to the fucking pool. I didn‚Äôt have time to fully register where the girl had gone‚Äîbefore a chorus of laughing and cheering broke out. 

I jumped up. Kaz and Imogen had definitely crossed the line.

‚ÄúYooo, Beck!‚Äù one of my old frat brothers passed me, clapping me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúControl your horny roommates!‚Äù

Ignoring him, I started towards my roommates. 

Maya Carlisle, however, stepped in front of me. 

She got close. So close, I could *smell* her. Raspberry flavored liquorice, and stale coffee. When she gripped my chin, her expensive manicure cutting into my flesh, something inside me violently lurched back. ‚ÄúYou *reek*, Beck,‚Äù she murmured, her lips finding my ear. 

‚ÄúWait until the trial.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúSorry, what?‚Äù

Maya didn't reply, stalking away with a one-fingered salute. 

Maya‚Äôs words barely grazed my mind. I reached my roommates. ‚ÄúGet dressed.‚Äù I hissed, throwing their clothes at them. 

""This is why people think we're weird. You can't *do that* at a party!‚Äù I pulled them from the rooftop, down spiraling stairs, my bare feet slapping down each  cement stair. ‚ÄúYou two are un-fucking-believable.‚Äù

Charlie Delacroix clung onto me, stumbling over his feet. ""Relax!"" Kaz‚Äôs laugh was way too spluttered to be sober. ‚ÄúWe were just having fun!‚Äù he got close‚Äì too close‚Äì murmuring in my ear. ‚ÄúYou should maybe join.""

‚ÄúYou're drunk, Kaz.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not!‚Äù

Pushing through the doors leading outside, I didn't realize I was staggering. 

Imogen did a twirl, tipping her head back, her hair flying behind her. ‚ÄúLook! It's a full moon!‚Äù 

""I'll call an‚Ä¶ Uber,"" Kaz said, his voice slurring. ""Stay here, all right?""

""Wait."" I kept hold of his wrists, and it was the first time I felt it: this gnawing intensity for him to stay with me. 

Warm and real, and somehow, primal. I had liked him since we met. 

Since he threw that fucking sweater over my shoulder and saved me from my own ego. But now, it felt right. 

Instead of explaining *why* I didn't want to let my roommate go, why my fingernails clung to the collar of his shirt, *why* I was overly aware of Imogen staying close,  I kissed him, quickly, starving, breathless. 

Kaz pulled away, blinking rapidly. ‚ÄúWhat was *that*?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, this‚Ä¶this sounds crazy,‚Äù I hissed, grabbing his hands. ‚ÄúCan you promise not to laugh?‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs mouth split into a grin. ‚ÄúHave you been talking to the weird flat earther guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúKaz.‚Äù I hissed. 

‚ÄúRowan, he's got like, half a brain-cell!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that's not what I wanted to‚Ä¶ to talk about.‚Äù I whispered, my voice splitting into giggles. 

‚ÄúKaz.‚Äù I pulled him close, and he burst out laughing, tipping his head back, full-on hyena laughing. ‚ÄúListen to me, all right?‚Äù I didn't realize I was laughing too. 

But I didn't remember drinking anything. 

‚ÄúDid we‚Ä¶ have a fourth roommate?‚Äù

Kaz blinked, straightening up. ‚ÄúHuhhhhh?‚Äù

Before he could speak, I swallowed my words, forcing a smile. 

‚ÄúIgnore me.‚Äù I clapped him on the back with a laugh. ‚ÄúI think I'm just, I dunno, drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah,‚Äù Kaz smirked. ‚ÄúYou kissed me.‚Äù

I let out a very nervous laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ did.‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúOkay, so maybe you're like, seeing glimpses from another universe where we *do* have a fourth roommate?‚Äù

I knew it. 

I wasn't the only one. 

I think he knew that too, his laughing coming to a sputtering halt. 

‚ÄúThat's exactly what I mean!‚Äù I hissed, thankful to move away from *that* conversation. 

In the corner of my eye, Imogen was bent over, politely puking in a puddle. 

I turned back to Kaz. ‚ÄúIt's right here,‚Äù I stabbed at my right temple. ‚ÄúLike, *right* here! I can see and sense and remember a fourth roommate‚Äì but it's like, I can't *see* them? Does that make sense?‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù His laugh was a little shaky.  ‚ÄúI was joking.‚Äù",1,1742991065.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

I go on Monday to peri. Pretty sure they will tell me I need a graft. I was told I have gingivitis by my doctor. My biggest concern is that my mouth is always inflamed and dry. Even my cheek skin falls off!?? Like the side of my cheek the skin peels off sometimes. My gums are all red and inflamed everywhere. I don't understand. I'm 36. 

I'm concerned because I'm worried s graft won't even help this. Everything is inflamed so much all the time. Like wtf??? But now it's becoming harder to floss because of recession on multiple teeth. Didn't anyone else have bad inflammation? ",1,1742990971.0,PeriodontalDisease,0,1.0,False

In my country they have Concerta, which I‚Äôm taking at the lowest available dose of 18mg. I do not foresee myself ever needing to increase this.

While I‚Äôve never exactly been forgetful, I did almost always find a way to NOT do things that needed to get done. I would often doomscroll instead of even playing my videogames! It‚Äôs only been a few days, but my screen usage has gone way down, being saved for bedtime like a good book. It has become so easy to jump up and just do the things that I want to get done. Like I‚Äôm on my 5th load of laundry, which would‚Äôve been more if my dryer wasn‚Äôt a butthead.

Now, since I‚Äôm still the same person, I am still playing my videogame called Vintage Story. It‚Äôs like Minecraft, but based on early world survival. In simple terms, I have achieved many small goals and chores without constantly asking myself what‚Äôs next or what I should be doing. I‚Äôve also noticed a reduction in the guilt/anxiety cycle that I face in game and daily life.

Physically, this medicine gives me the energy that 3 cups of coffee used to without the horrible side effects. I did read an older post on the subreddit before I started to see what symptoms I should expect. I‚Äôm happy to say that there aren‚Äôt any headaches and I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in my blood pressure. I am also incredibly happy that this curbs my appetite, as this country (that I recently moved to) has the best food in the world.

There is also a cosmic goodness that I started this medicine right when my grandma got sick and had to go to the hospital. Now that she‚Äôs home, I am constantly attending to her needs and organizing her medication times. I might be 33, but I am a complete child when it comes to caring for others. Being able to manage my grandma‚Äôs health (with my father‚Äôs assistance instead of the other way around) is something I am very grateful for.

All in all, I am very happy with Concerta. I have never in my life had this energy or mental clarity. Thank you so much for reading my personal tale! Please feel free to share your related stories below or ask any personal questions!

1jka3a6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1jka3a6/leaked_documents_reveal_the_collegeboard_uses/,Leaked Documents Reveal The CollegeBoard Uses Controversial Methodology to Determine SAT Scores,"Deep below the College Board headquarters in New York City, hidden behind keycard-locked doors and retina scanners, lies an underground facility specializing in one thing and one thing only: SAT scoring. Hence, it has been referred to by CollegeBoard officials as the START (yet another acronym that is a random vaguely-uplifting word), shorthand for the Standardized Testing Analytics and Review Terminal. It is in this room that SAT answer sheets from around the globe are shipped, processed, and scored - well, that's what we are meant to believe, at least.

According to College Board‚Äôs public statements, START is an advanced AI-driven analytics center that ‚Äòensures fairness and accuracy in the grading of standardized testing.‚Äô But according to one whistleblower who worked at START for six years, the reality is far more unsettling.

""It's a shuffling spree,"" the whistleblower wrote in his letter to the New York Times. ""There‚Äôs no AI. There‚Äôs no ‚Äòadvanced analytics.‚Äô It's just interns and broke college students trying shamelessly to get their foot in the door at CollegeBoard throwing test sheets into a giant machine that shuffles them together.""

The way it works is simple: every test sheet is thrown into a large industrial blender of sorts, often called *The Spinner.* The sheets are mixed up pseudo-randomly for several hours, producing a batch of scores that match the desired Poisson distribution.  Once the sheets come out of the shuffler, they are spread out on a large table where a group of **u**ntrained interns lie in wait. These interns are known as the *Score Settlers.*

Once shuffled, the piles are stacked into groups of 20. The interns then assign scores randomly to each group, ensuring that the first few sheets in a pile get scores in the upper range (like 1400s and 1500s), while the last few sheets are assigned scores like 900s and 1000s. The rest of the pile gets the average scores, but the exact numbers are up to the mood of the intern.  
  
""I just go with my gut,"" says one anonymous intern. ""If I feel a student has a nice name, they get a 1500. If their name is too long and I get confused, they might get a 1300.""

As of writing this, the Department of Homeland Security has reported that they have seen a dramatic increase in certain ""name-changing applications"" as parents have realized that having a shorter name for their child will boost their chances of ultimately being ivy-bound. But experts have raised valid concerns that even those named ""ts pmo"" will have to brave the random nature of *The Spinner.* 

A recent mathematical paper published by The CollegeBoard's research department (which, NYT insiders uncovered, poached their researchers directly from Columbia University after government funding cuts forced these recent graduates to look for other options) proved that this seemingly obscure method is ""stochastically sound"" and was proven to produce a normal distribution in 99.993% of cases. 

In the end, the SAT scoring process remains shrouded in secrecy. CollegeBoard‚Äôs public stance is that the system is ‚Äúprecise, data-driven, and fair,‚Äù but insiders know the truth: the real secret to scoring well is less to do with the study guides or prep classes and more to do with the student's family name as well as how many coffees the grossly overworked and underpaid interns were able to snag from the CollegeBoard's stingy break room.

We have been together for almost 10 years and have two kids (4 and 2). I took a year off work when my daughter was born, then returned to work remotely. Since I was home I did all the child care and taking care of the house. My husband works a pretty labor intensive job so I didn‚Äôt nag much about the duties, but would always have to remind him to do his (two) house ‚Äúchores‚Äù or it wouldn‚Äôt get done. Being that it was trash and our cat litter it needed to be done for the basic sanitation of our home. He still would contribute to the home semi but it would mostly be prompted. Anyway, my husband got a job last spring that took him from the home from around 7 to 7 M-F. We decided I would be a stay at home mom completely until both our kids are a little older since my job was moving back into office and was about an hour away. 

For the last year I have adjusted fairly well. Being a SAHM to small children is definitely not easy, but I enjoy it. I made a cleaning schedule so the house is always tidy, I make a weekly menu and rotate meals to make sure we are eating a variety, I do the budgeting, I handling paying the bills, and still make time to take care of myself quite well. I wake up everyday at 5 am to work out and self care, then prep everyone‚Äôs lunches/breakfast and his smoothie. 

My husband on the other hand in my opinion is not handling work/life balance well. He comes home and goes straight to the bathroom (which I understand because of his job) but spends anywhere from 45 to an hour almost everyday (my daily shower(s) is about 15- 20 min). He hasn‚Äôt been taking care of himself mentally or physically that well. Then I feel like I always have to prompt him to do something/interact with our kids. Talk, draw, read a book, or even just sit outback on the chairs and watch them play in the yard. He just wants to sit on the couch and scroll IG/whatever else and put them to watch a show. Then after bed time he usually goes on his phone more and then to play video games. Which sometimes is ok but EVERY DAY? Anyway- my husband doesn‚Äôt clean. He doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself at all and leaves his dirty clothes in the bathroom floor. He only cleans the cat litter box (I refuse because I told him I couldn‚Äôt handle a cat when our daughter was little because of the litter) and I have to tell him every.single.time. I don‚Äôt expect him to do necessarily half but at least tidy after himself. 

So this morning, I work out. I go to shower and take a little longer than usual since my hair is dirty and I sweated a lot this time. (Usually I don‚Äôt sweat too much and wear a little head band and my hair is fine.) my husband comes in to tell me he is leaving early and can I do breakfast now. I say ok and get out. I come downstairs and see that there are dirty plates in the sink. I get upset because this happens all the time. My husband goes to play video games and eat, which is fine. I hate cleaning first thing in the morning so I make sure the kitchen is clean before I go to sleep. He doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself. I have an attitude and when he comes downstairs says thank you and I said welcome and went to walk to upstairs. I wasn‚Äôt super happy. He asks what‚Äôs wrong and I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm upset that you never clean up after yourself‚Äù trying to stay calm. He says nothing and walks out not taking his food or coffee. It wasn‚Äôt a fight or anything but he obviously is trying to make a statement but not taking his stuff. Am I being unreasonable with expecting him to clean up after himself?

I would appreciate any advice given to improve my statement! I have unfortunately not acquired an internship during my undergraduate - currently in my 3rd and final year, and still yet to find a graduate scheme that will take me in. Hoping this plan B with a masters will work out!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Finance is the driving force behind global economies, influencing decision-making at every level. Considering the recent turmoil in the global economic trade and financial markets, there is an even greater necessity in understanding how governments, households and firms react to an ever-changing landscape. My academic background, combined with my passion for financial markets and problem-solving, has inspired me to pursue an MSc in Finance. This program will equip me with the advanced knowledge and technical skills required to excel in the dynamic industry. 

During my undergraduate studies in Economics and Finance at the University of (Non-target), I developed a solid foundation in financial modelling, derivatives, econometrics and financial economics. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I enhanced my analytical and critical-thinking abilities. Notably, I undertook a project in portfolio allocation, constructing and optimizing a diversified portfolio of 10-20 assets utilising excel solver and arbitrage pricing theory to find the efficient portfolio based on the needs of the client. Employing econometric analysis, I have also assessed relationships between an S&P 500 asset and various macroeconomic factors, applying regression models and various other econometric techniques ensuring the validity of my results.

My commitment to continuous learning has also led me to explore financial risk management and trading strategies. For example, via university coursework, I analysed how FX forward outright can mitigate currency risk in international transactions, gaining insights into practical risk management applications. I am also undergoing options training with an ex-Equity Derivatives head from a major bank in which I‚Äôm learning different strategies used by institutions in the active trading of equities in all market conditions.

Furthering my technical pursuits, I have explored Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applications in fixed-income markets, analyzing yield curve dynamics and extracting latent factors that drive market fluctuations. This exploration has not only enhanced my understanding of fixed-income securities but also demonstrated the practical applications of quantitative methods in real-world financial analysis.

Beyond academics, I have developed strong leadership and interpersonal skills that are directly applicable financial roles. Serving as the head of my secondary school badminton team honed my decision-making and teamwork abilities. During my undergraduate studies, I have started and effectively managed the University of (non target) coffee society with a role of treasurer. Furthermore, achieving a distinction in the final stage of LAMDA Public Speaking reflects my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively, a necessity in client facing and presenting roles.

This MSc Finance program offers the ideal platform to refine my quantitative skills and gain exposure to advanced financial concepts. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to engage with experienced faculty, collaborate with a diverse ambitious cohort, and participate in real-world case studies. With my academic background, practical experience, and dedication to the field, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the program. My long-term aspiration is to pursue a career in financial markets, specializing in quantitative finance and fixed income analysis. By undertaking this programme, I aim to build a strong foundation that will enable me to make impactful contributions to the financial industry.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further my academic and professional journey through this programme.",1,1742990326.0,UniUK,0,1.0,False

1jk9uou,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1jk9uou/fertile_myrtle_and_birth_control/,Fertile Myrtle and Birth Control,"I need help or advice or even just one positive story. Birth control and I are not sitting well together but I don't really have a choice. 

Some background: 

The pill\~ This was my first birth control. I was 15 and I was on the pill where you did not have a period for 3 months. I really liked having less periods and at this point in my life I was super consistent taking them. My only complaint was that when I drank more than a cup of coffee, I would start spotting or just start my period early. I've never heard anyone else experience this. In 2020 in combination with the pandemic, I experienced depression for the first time and got off the pill. 

IUD\~ \*buckle up\* I got my first IUD at 18. I lovedddddd it. I got the Liletta which was approved for 7-8 years. I loved the ""out of sight, out of mind"" aspect. My period basically was non-existant. I raved about the IUD to all my friends. Yes the placement was painful, but I would have done it happily every 7 years for child free, condom free life (I am in a long term exclusive relationship).

Fast forward to 2024, I get pregnant!! I am 21 btw at this time. I found out because I was bleeding for 2 weeks, it was consistently a light flow of bright red and this was abnormal so I went to my provider. I miscarried naturally over the course of a few months. They think that I had an ectopic pregnancy. #traumatic 

I was livid because when I got my IUD originally, at every check up, I asked for a confirmation ultrasound to ensure it was in the right place. .  because your girl is ANXIOUS and BROKE. My provider at the time told me it was not normal protocol and that she could see my strings. I was denied every time I asked, it took me getting pregnant for that wish to come true. ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AT THE DOCTOR, they are not loosing anything my ordering an ultrasound that they most likely won't even preform!!!!

I tried again for a second IUD, the Mirena. I went in for a 6 week ultrasound and it was again, in the lower segment of my cervix making it ineffective. I had it removed. I did not have the closure I needed because I never had the confirmation that any of my previous IUD's were placed correctly, like my first one worked for 4 years so what if it just migrated over time? 

I got a MRI with contrast and a few lengthy ultrasounds telling me that my uterus is healthy and within normal limits. My uterus is positioned on the far left side of my body (which is funny because I only cramp on my left side), and tilted forward. 

For my 3rd and last attempt at getting an IUD my provider gave me Valium, misoprostol that I placed vaginally the night before, a lidocane block, and placed under ultrasound. It was still placed in the lower cervix. The only other option my provider gave me was to place it under anesthesia but it was clear to me at this point that the IUD was not for me. I was and honestly still am heart broken. 

  
No sex, no birth control\~ This was me for like 4 months after my last IUD failed. I was long distance and even when we were together I didn't crave sex. I was heart broken, mad, and scared. I really liked tracking my cycle. . . I could feel when I ovulated and predict my period down to the hour. I really enjoyed being in-tune with my body. My partner and I had a broken condom scare so that kicked my brain back into gear. 

  
Haloette (generic nuvaring)- I have been on this for a week because I prefer the ""out of sight, out of mind"" method. I am constantly spotting with dark clotty discharge. I kinda hate the idea of keeping this in during sex but I haven't tried it yet. I don't know if I trust any birth control without a condom anymore tbh. . . heartbreaking for me. I like that I will still have a cycle every month. I don't like that idea that if I forget to put this back in, if the ring is out for a total of 3 hours in the month cycle, that it is not effective at its fullest. Idk about you but I typically engage longer than 3 hours in a week let alone a month. Its only been a week so obviously hard to say. 

Thoughts\~ I'm feeling defeated with all my options. I have completely ruled out the Depo shot, there are too many negative stories. I would prefer not to have the nexplanon arm implant because my sister tried to go down the sewerslide with hers, when she typically is not like that. I am not opposed to the patch. I really don't want the pill again, I work at a facility that is open 24/7 and my schedule changes frequently, and honestly I don't want to be reminded every day with a pill. 

  
Can someone share their experience or comment on mine, I wish that I could just turn my uterus on and off at will because I really loved being natural and off meds. Unfortunately that is not responsibl for me at this time. I do want a family in the future. . . just now is definitely not the time.

Abstract

Communication is the foundation of social interaction, yet it is often structured around implicit neurotypical norms that can create barriers for neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with high logical processing. This paper explores how conventional expectations of ambiguity tolerance, procedural rigidity, and social performativity lead to cognitive dissonance, inefficiency, and exclusion for neurodivergent thinkers. Drawing on research from cognitive psychology, sociolinguistics, and neurodiversity studies, this analysis highlights the systemic disadvantages neurodivergent individuals face in education, workplaces, and bureaucratic structures. The paper concludes by proposing an alternative communication framework that prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and cognitive accessibility over neurotypical social conventions.

1. Introduction



Society operates on unspoken communication rules that prioritize social nuance, implicit meaning, and emotional signaling over direct, logical discourse. While these norms function effectively for neurotypical individuals, they often create barriers for neurodivergent thinkers‚Äîespecially those with high logical processing, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or gifted intellectual profiles.

These individuals frequently experience difficulty navigating vague instructions, unwritten social rules, and performative aspects of communication that do not align with their cognitive processing styles. The resulting disconnect can lead to misunderstandings, exclusion, and systemic inefficiencies in education, workplaces, and institutional settings. This paper examines how rigid social expectations create communication barriers and offers a framework for a more cognitively accessible approach to interaction.

2. Core Systemic Barriers to Communication



2.1 Procedural Rigidity in Social Interaction

Neurotypical communication often follows unspoken rules that are not explicitly taught, requiring individuals to infer meaning from context. For neurodivergent individuals, this can create cognitive overload, as they may prioritize logical consistency and directness over inferred social meaning.

Example:

A workplace email requesting feedback may include the phrase, ""If you have any thoughts, feel free to share!"" A neurodivergent individual may interpret this literally and not respond unless they have a significant contribution, while a neurotypical colleague understands that a response is implicitly expected.

Studies show that neurodivergent individuals often require explicit expectations in social and professional interactions (Milton, 2012). When these expectations are ambiguous, it creates unnecessary cognitive effort, leading to stress and miscommunication.

2.2 Ambiguity Tolerance and Logical Processing Conflicts

Neurotypical communication relies heavily on implicit meaning, vague phrasing, and indirect requests. However, neurodivergent individuals‚Äîespecially those with high logical reasoning‚Äîtend to process information literally and expect statements to be precise.

Example:

A professor telling a student, ""Try to finish this by the end of the week,"" may mean it as a polite suggestion. A neurodivergent student might assume it is optional and prioritize other deadlines, leading to academic penalties.

Research suggests that autistic individuals, for example, have a lower tolerance for ambiguous language and benefit from explicit communication (Bodner et al., 2015). The disconnect between implicit expectations and literal interpretation results in inefficiency and exclusion.

2.3 Social Performativity and Communication Fatigue

Many neurodivergent individuals struggle with the expectation of social performativity‚Äîthe use of nonverbal cues, small talk, and implied social norms to build relationships. This can be exhausting and cognitively draining, especially in environments that prioritize social cohesion over direct information exchange.

Example:

A job interview may prioritize a candidate‚Äôs ability to make eye contact and engage in casual conversation rather than their technical skills. Neurodivergent applicants may be penalized despite being highly qualified for the role.

Studies in neurodiversity and employment show that hiring processes often disadvantage autistic and ADHD individuals due to their difficulty engaging in neurotypical social rituals (Waisman et al., 2020).

3. Institutional Biases in Communication Norms



3.1 Education: Penalizing Direct Thinking

Educational systems reward students who can intuit implicit rules, engage in socialized learning, and tolerate ambiguity. Neurodivergent students often struggle in these environments due to rigid grading rubrics, vague expectations, and inconsistent communication from educators.

Example:

A student who asks, ""Can you clarify exactly what you want in this essay?"" may be dismissed as being difficult, rather than recognized as someone seeking clarity.

Research suggests that direct, structured communication improves academic outcomes for neurodivergent learners (Pfeiffer et al., 2019). However, schools often fail to provide such clarity.

3.2 Workplace Dynamics: Exclusion from Leadership Roles

Neurodivergent professionals face barriers to career advancement due to unwritten workplace norms prioritizing social networking, diplomatic phrasing, and office politics over direct problem-solving.

Example:

A neurodivergent employee who efficiently identifies flaws in a project may be perceived as too blunt, while a neurotypical colleague who diplomatically frames criticism is seen as a better leader.

Studies indicate that autistic professionals are underrepresented in leadership roles due to workplace bias against direct communication styles (Hedley et al., 2018).

3.3 Bureaucracy: Cognitive Burden of Indirect Communication

Government and institutional systems rely on overly complex, indirect communication that disproportionately disadvantages neurodivergent individuals.

Example:

Filling out tax forms or applying for disability benefits often requires navigating vague language, implied steps, and inconsistent formatting‚Äîbarriers that increase cognitive overload.

Research confirms that accessibility in bureaucratic processes remains an unresolved issue for neurodivergent populations (Botha & Frost, 2020).


---

4. Toward a More Accessible Communication Framework



To reduce systemic barriers, an alternative communication model should prioritize:

1. Explicit Expectations: Providing clear, direct instructions rather than relying on social intuition.


2. Precision in Language: Avoiding ambiguous or indirect phrasing that can be misinterpreted.


3. Reduction of Social Performativity: Valuing information-sharing over unnecessary social rituals.


4. Flexible Assessment of Communication Competence: Recognizing that clarity and efficiency can be more valuable than adherence to neurotypical norms.




---

5. Conclusion



Neurodivergent individuals with high logical processing often face exclusion due to rigid social communication norms that prioritize ambiguity, implicit meaning, and social performance. These systemic barriers are evident in education, workplace dynamics, and bureaucratic systems, where inefficiency and cognitive dissonance arise from misaligned communication styles. By adopting a more explicit, precise, and accessible communication framework, society can create a more equitable environment that values cognitive diversity over rigid neurotypical conventions.

Why Communication Feels Broken for Logical Thinkers in a Neurotypical World

Imagine you're in a meeting, and your boss says, ""It would be great if we could get this report done soon."" If you're a logical thinker, you might wonder: What does ‚Äòsoon‚Äô mean? Tomorrow? Next week? Meanwhile, your coworkers immediately understand that the boss actually means, ""Have this done by Friday.""

This kind of vague, indirect communication is everywhere in daily life. Most people‚Äîespecially those who are neurotypical‚Äîhave learned to navigate it effortlessly. But for neurodivergent individuals with high logical processing (such as those with autism, ADHD, or analytical thinking styles), it can create frustration, confusion, and even exclusion.

This article explores why communication is often difficult for logical thinkers, how society‚Äôs unwritten rules create barriers, and what we can do to build a world where communication works better for everyone.

1. Why Do Some People Struggle with Everyday Communication?

The way people communicate isn‚Äôt just about words. It‚Äôs about how things are said, what‚Äôs left unsaid, and the subtle social cues hidden between the lines. Neurotypical people generally pick up on these cues automatically. Neurodivergent individuals, on the other hand, often process communication more logically and literally.

Let‚Äôs break this down into three major challenges logical thinkers face when navigating everyday conversations.

2. Three Ways Traditional Communication Creates Barriers

1. Unspoken Social Rules (That No One Explains)

Many conversations rely on unwritten rules that people are just expected to know. For logical thinkers, this can be frustrating‚Äîespecially when breaking these unspoken rules leads to negative reactions.

Example:

You‚Äôre in a job interview, and the interviewer asks, ‚ÄúTell me a little about yourself.‚Äù You give a straightforward answer: ‚ÄúI have a degree in computer science, and I‚Äôm skilled in data analysis.‚Äù

The interviewer expects small talk‚Äîhobbies, interests, or a bit of personality. They interpret your directness as cold or unfriendly, even though you were simply answering efficiently.

This is a common experience for neurodivergent individuals, who often prefer clear expectations over vague social norms. When communication rules aren‚Äôt made explicit, misunderstandings happen, and logical thinkers can be unfairly judged.

2. Vague and Indirect Language (That Creates Confusion)

Neurotypical communication often relies on hints rather than direct statements. For logical thinkers, this can make it difficult to know what‚Äôs actually expected.

Example:

Your friend says, ""I'm really thirsty.""

A neurotypical listener might hear this as a polite request for a drink.

A logical thinker might just acknowledge the statement: ""Oh, that‚Äôs unfortunate.""

Many logical thinkers prefer clear, precise language‚Äîlike ""Could you get me some water?"" Without directness, messages can get lost, leading to awkward moments and frustration.

This happens in bigger situations too:

A professor says, ""Try to submit your paper by the end of the week,"" meaning it's a soft deadline.

A logical student might take this as an optional suggestion, only to be penalized for a late submission.

These disconnects create unnecessary stress and misunderstandings.

3. Social Performance Over Clear Information

Many social and professional situations reward how something is said rather than what is said. This puts logical thinkers at a disadvantage, as they may struggle with small talk, eye contact, or ‚Äúsugar-coating‚Äù their words.

Example:

A worker points out a major flaw in a project: ‚ÄúThis plan won‚Äôt work because the numbers are incorrect.‚Äù

Their neurotypical colleague says the same thing more diplomatically: ‚ÄúThis is a great starting point, but maybe we should double-check the numbers.‚Äù

The second person is seen as a better communicator, even though both messages contain the same information.

In job interviews, promotions, and social interactions, people who naturally use indirect, ‚Äúpolite‚Äù phrasing are often favored‚Äîleaving logical thinkers overlooked, even when they have valuable insights.

3. How These Communication Barriers Play Out in Daily Life

These communication differences don‚Äôt just cause occasional awkwardness‚Äîthey shape how neurodivergent people experience education, work, and society as a whole.

1. School: Confusing Expectations and Unclear Instructions

Classrooms often assume students just know how to navigate vague rules. Neurodivergent students who need direct, explicit instructions can struggle with:

Assignments with unclear guidelines (""Write an essay about a historical event""‚Äîwhich one? How long? What details matter?).

Teachers who expect students to ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù instead of asking questions directly.

This can lead to unfair grading, frustration, and the perception that logical students are difficult when they‚Äôre simply looking for clarity.

2. Work: The Social Side of Success

In many jobs, promotions and leadership roles go to those with strong social skills‚Äînot just technical expertise. If a workplace values office politics and diplomacy over direct problem-solving, neurodivergent employees may find themselves stuck in lower-level positions despite their abilities.

Example:

A talented engineer is overlooked for management because they struggle with small talk and networking, even though they‚Äôre highly skilled in problem-solving.

3. Bureaucracy: Forms, Rules, and Red Tape

Government agencies, banks, and healthcare systems often use confusing, indirect language that can be overwhelming for logical thinkers.

Example:

A form asks: ‚ÄúList any relevant information that may impact your eligibility.‚Äù

A neurodivergent applicant wonders: What counts as relevant? What happens if I include too much or too little?

When essential services rely on unclear language, it makes life harder for people who process information literally and logically.

4. How We Can Make Communication More Accessible

If we want a world where everyone can communicate effectively, we need to change the way we think about conversations. Here are a few ways to make communication more inclusive:

1. Say What You Mean‚ÄîClearly and Directly

Instead of ""Let‚Äôs catch up soon,"" try ""Let‚Äôs meet for coffee next Tuesday at 3 PM.""

Instead of ""It would be great if you could send that report soon,"" try ""Please send the report by Friday at noon.""

2. Provide Explicit Expectations

In schools, teachers should clearly define grading criteria and deadlines instead of assuming students can guess.

In workplaces, managers should set clear expectations for promotions instead of relying on networking and social skills.

3. Stop Penalizing Direct Communicators

Instead of labeling someone ""too blunt"" or ""too literal,"" recognize that different communication styles exist‚Äîand that being direct is not the same as being rude.

4. Design Systems for Clarity

Government forms, workplace policies, and school guidelines should be written in straightforward, unambiguous language.

5. Conclusion

Many neurodivergent individuals with high logical processing struggle with the way society communicates‚Äînot because they lack social skills, but because traditional communication favors ambiguity, unwritten rules, and indirect speech.

By shifting toward clear, direct, and explicit communication, we can create a world where logical thinkers are heard, valued, and included. And ultimately, that benefits everyone‚Äîbecause good communication is about making sure people truly understand each other.

Naturally, I proposed to my favourite girlfriend Anneta at that time and we got married two days later.

After the wedding we went on a lovely honeymoon in Chestnut Ridge. Anneta had wanted to go somewhere more exotic like Sulani but since I had already spent most of the inheritance on a new house for us, Chestnut Ridge was really all we could afford and since all girls love horses I thought this would be PERFECT! She also got upset that I spent most of the honeymoon at the computer trying to get an online diploma so I could still attend university after getting kicked out of highschool one day before graduation. I thought she wouldn't mind because my former roommate Toni had also tagged along and could just keep her company (he was feeling very lonely after I moved out and the big neighboor hoods in Chestnut Ridge gave him a chance to let out his inner werewolf). After all, education should be more important than exploring the world together, right?

Anyway, shortly after we got home from our honeymoon Anneta got fired from her job as a teacher for trying some new methods and I tried to cheer her up in bed. We had a little accident but I didn't really mind because I had since been accepted into university and was about to make big money with my degree and be able to support our family on one income soon enough. I was also still working as a barista part-time between classes to get us by so all seemed fine.

Then I got a call from the producers of the show ""7 Wild Dates"" who basically said that I could just go on 7 perfect dates and make an easy 25k¬ß. The producers mentioned that I could just go on 7 dates with the same person but it would be more interesting to spice it up so I might've left out that little detail when I told my wife about this. Naturally she agreed that we couldn't pass up this chance for some free money. I chose her for my first date and then traveled around some community lots and hit it off with 6 different women between classes. I also ended each date with a harmless kiss because I was still trying to advance on my serial romantic aspiration after being faithful to my wife for so long (I still had to kiss 9 more Sims since my earlier adventures had not been counted for this milestone!). Of course all of the dates went perfect and we got the money easy peasy.

Meanwhile my wife had spent most of her time at home wiht her new friend group - mostly consisting of some snobish older women like Nancy Landgraab, Clara Bjergsen, Lily Feng - and some girls that we knew back from highschool. The girls spent all their time drinking coffee, listening to music and probably complaining about their husbands so each time I got home after a long day of work, university and dating I had to clean up all of their dirty coffee mugs and vaccuum around since my wife couldn't be bothered because ""she was too busy with the baby"". She even screamed at me one evening saying how I wasn't contributing enough which seemed really unfair since I was the only one earning money and paying our bills at that time. I even made sure to put our son in his crib some evenings so I could bond with him while telling bedtime stories.

Nonetheless, we got through that phase and after getting the 25k¬ß all seemed fined and things calmed down - that is until the first episodes aired and my wife saw me kissing other women on tv. I had also become a 3 star celebrity and was now constantly followed by paparazzi who spread lies about me being unfaithful and flirting with other Sims while I was just trying to advance my romance skill for a university class...!

So Anneta finally saw red and divorced me, kicking me out of our house (which had been paid with MY inheritance) and also kept most of the money to provide for our son Jake (which was fine by me because I do love him, even if he was an accident).



I'm currently sitting on a blow-up mattress in my new apartment which is part of a converted factory in Windenburg while typing this and can't really decide whether my wife was wrong for kicking me out or if I truly was the llama for giving too much of my attention to other women. It doesn't help that my two moms and their ghost dog have also come to stay for four days to ""help with the baby"" which doesn't even make any sense since Jake lives with his mom in Brindleton Bay and it stresses me out to share my tiny room with them.

I currently take IR 15mg 2x daily. At my last montly med check, I expressed that I wanted to keep trying the two doses of IR another month to keep wiggling/adjusting the times I take it to see what works with my sleep and on varying days. My days really don't vary much, other than I hold off a bit longer for my first does on weekends as I supposedly could sleep in (if my body plays nice). 

My days essentially start 5-5:30am and I am ready to turn in around 9-9:30. I sleep hard, now, after countless years struggling with insomnia. I slept from 10:30- lasst night until 5:30am this morning with a few short awakenings. I am struggling in the mornings, even with coffee that is advised against, until I can take my firs dose. It kicks in about an hour or hour and a half later. I try to take it at 6, then I basically will feel more tired by noon, but I try not to take my second dose until about 2 so I can still function until closer to bedtime and not ""crash"" by 5pm or 6 if I'd taken dose #2 at noon.  That's all okay, except between 1-2;30pm is naptime for my kiddos at work, and a prime time where I am in my classroom trying to plan/prep/etc during time. If my dose is worn off, I'm tired and can't focus during this time. I do not have downtime during my day, basically.

I have my next med check on April 1st. I'd mentioned something previously to her about breaking up the two IR pills into 4 smalls ones taking the pills over the course of the 12-16hrs, but she said something about how that only makes your dose feel lower, it doesn't extend it any longer or even it out. Like, I need the higher dose initially anyway, and it stays as long as it can at a peak then putters out, then you take next dose? Plus, I'd likely forget 4 pills spaced out. So, before I talk to her about going for XR at a certain dose, and possibly an afternoon booster, can anyone who has been on Adderall close to 30mg a day, and tried XR and IR, what have been your dosage managing experience?  I like the idea of still having IR because of the flexibility, but these two just areb't getting me covered all the hours I need to fucntion.

So we used one last night, went to sleep around 10pm, nothing weird or different from any other night besides the mosquito burning plaque 

There was no mosquitos anywhere but around 5am I started noticing that I was feeling very hot, so I take away my blanket, after 10min or so I started feeling really cold, so I got my blanket on again. When I did that I just started sweating like If I just had a fever, so I sat on the bed and tried to catch my real temperature and symptoms. 

I wasn't feeling ""bad"" and I didn't have a ""heat"" feeling like when you are having a fever, not even headache or sore throat, I didn't feel like a dry mouth or difficult breathing, so I just was sitting there, confused, somehow freezing but this time it was for the amount of sweat I had. 

The night before we didn't use the plaques so the only inconvenience was getting mosquito bites randomly at night, I wasn't feeling bad or ill, just tired from the day. 

So yeah, I think we will use those plaques this night too just to be sure because I couldn't find anything on allergy to that specific thing, if you know something please let me know, I just want to sleep without mosquitoes and not having weird symptoms.

Technically I did ""break"" my fasting right, but my objectif is to lose weight ""quickly"" (i want to lose 7 to 10 kgs). Besides fasting I do **10,000 steps on fasting day**, and I exercice (cardio, **running 30 minutes to 1 hour**) on **eating day.** I drink also **2.5 to 3L water a day**

I already know you guys are going to said ""Dude, you still have a high deficit in calories so you""ll lose weight"", but it's more about how ""slower"" will I lose weight. I know you have to be 24h+ in fasting to get into the ""autophagy"" mode. But technically on 36h I do 16h and 20h.

Just inherited a Gaggia Classic from a friend who suspected that the brew thermostat had gone. Ive replaced the brew thermostat and reapplied thermal grease (used some cpu thermal paste). 

Reassembled the machine (had to replace the power switch and brew switch since they basically disassembled themselves when i removed the front panel for access) 

Tried to pull some shots and they are really bad in terms of crema and smell a bit burnt. Ive measured the temperature via probe in a glass under a filter without coffee grounds. Got around 77 degrees celsius. 

Also when i turn the steam knob i immidiately get steam even when the steam button is not pressed. It can however dispense hot water when pressing both steam and brew button at the same time.

Does anyone know of any further troubleshooting steps?

one of the biggest realizations i've had is that no one cares what time i get into the office; especially bc everyone knows i'm an early bird and have already been working before i even get into the office.

that i use to stress over something no one else cares about or even knows...

*side note: toiling away in the shadows protecting people from themselves while they hate me for it describes most of my life but i digress...*

...is a perfect example suffering from artificial constraints. 

now, for example i have eleven minutes before ~~i have to~~ i've ***decided*** to get ready for work (see i just did it again bc i don't HAVE to get ready for work so i also need to work on the language i use), and am choosing to write this up.

do i have to get ready exactly at 7:30? nope. do i even have an alarm set on my phone? nope. 

but i'll be fine to navigate away from this write-up *around* 7:30 or else i'll just be dily dallying around and would rather go ahead and get moving for the day bc i'm looking forward to that double bacon burrito i'm going to reward myself with in the cafeteria.

it's now 7:23am.

so anyway, yeah, artificial constraints are everywhere and i continue to refine my approach to life, incl shrinking/simplifying/tuning my life such that all that remains is getting close to simply food/hygiene/exercise; because that's all i really need and everything else is fleeting anyway so why 'rat race' all the other 'noise'.

7:25am.

having said that, i do need to work and drive to get food from the grocery bc there are no animals/vegetables to eat around me. thus, my job is to get food using money which is made up but that's where we are these days which is ok.

7:27am. i need to take a drink of coffee...

ah i'm now done with my coffee so am free, haha. it's the little things, haha. anway, i'm going to start motivating now and i'm going do the deal at work and in each moment i'm just going to do what i can and what i can't i'll ask for help with and if i'm wrong about any estimates i give then i'll update the estimates and my organization is forgiving if nothing else bc it's chaotically disorganized so i'm just going to go with the flow.

I'm ending it all.,"So I'm a 17-year-old teen from the Philippines, and I really wanna fucking end it, not because of what I've done but also this fucked up mind can't change itself no matter what I do. So basically there was this person  who is my ""uncle"" (let's call him alan) since he knew my dad when I was only 8-years-old. I already gained realization at 11-years-old that this mfer had bad intentions with my family, the way he looks and talks to my dad with an aggressive voice, how he looks at my sister (I once heard him say ""She is probably hot once she hits 18, but I'll wait for her 18th birthday to come""), and even how he looks at me (he always stares at me like I'm some slave of his), I knew that I must prepare in any day he shows his satanic behaviour. Day by day I observe his move, but stopped observing him when I was at high school since I really need to focus on academics. now a bit into the present (this incident happened on December 2025), my sister (now 18-years-old) invited her friends since they're celebrating after a hard project. They wanted to talk to me because one of her friends has a crush on me, but I was at my room at that time scrolling on some random stuff on the internet and being lazy. Then I heard a loud scream, The scream sounded like my sister's voice, and my prediction was right. ""Alan"" and my sister kept throwing words until Alan slapped her two times, she was in tears and her friends got her inside the house. Now I thought that my father would handle the situation since he told me to never interfere with his business, but when I was going downstairs to see whats going on, my father was laying on the couch, eyes and skin boiling red as he was suffering from high blood pressure. My mom was working in Thailand in that time so we didn't have a mother to take care of my father in these situations. I didn't know what I can do,until I saw my homemade zombie weapon in the corner (which I don't know why I made it), my mind was telling me to grab that weapon and kill my Alan, the voices get louder and I tried to hold back, but I looked at the scenario one more time, only to realize that this shitbag has done so much, so I'll pay him back 10x worse. So without hesitation, I immediately started to hit him forcefully. The weapon was covered in blood and a small part of his skin is torn, I wanted to stop but my brain is telling me to continue. He was telling me to stop but I continued to dislocate his shoulder, tear a part of his skin off, blind one of his eyes, burn his skin with hot coffee. Suddenly my other uncle told me to stop (he was the head of the community) and told me to get inside and they would deal with this situation. the conversation between me, my dad, my uncle, my sister was really long, but my uncle told me that he'll take care of this situation and make sure I'm safe and not arrested for attempted murder, my father told me to drop out of school since what I've done was violent, my sisters friends became distant to me since they've all saw what I've done. After that event, I don't know what to do with my life, the academics, respect, and charisma I had, gone after that one act. The memory of that incident is still in my head and day by day the urge to murder him gets stronger. I have no one to vent my problems at, I don't even trust the healthline crisis hotline, I can't forget the incident no matter what I do. I've already plan when to kill myself by drinking rat poison and paint thiner for a clean death for a dirty soul like mine.

I have seen her go in and out of her apartment like two times, but we have never talked. Now, I do not have a crush or anything, but curiosity got the better of me and I now know that she lives alone, her age and also that she studies at the same university as me. All of this information is open for anyone and nothing is really surprising. I will admit that it is a bit creepy of me to look it up, but I am not asking for a moral advice so please see this simply is a fun opportunity to help a fellow redditor out.

Summertime is approaching and I was thinking that I could ask if she would like to get a coffee or something like that. To be clear my intention is not to ask her out on an actual date (even though it is similar) since we do not know each other at all. As I said I do not have a crush, therefore I would be perfectly fine with simply getting a new friend if it would turn out that way. My real honest intention is that I hope she is nice and that we could date but it is perhaps a bit of a long shot to think about considering we have never even talked. Also I am aware that she might just say no which I cannot do anything about. It would of course be little awkward at first, but I know I would get over it even though we live next to each other.

So, lets say I take a shower, put on some nice but casual clothes and go knock on her door this weekend. What can I say that does not make me a creep and that might catch her interest? What are some fitting activities we could do?

However, I only have a limited number of motivation points to spend on some days and sometimes I need quick and easy things to shovel in my mouth without immediately adding two inches to the waist. 

For me, these are some of those things in no particular order.

**Banana** - My most frequent snack is fruit, and bananas are my favourite fruit. Potassium!

**Apple** - Sometimes I get bored of bananas.

**Baked Beans** - I'm a Brit so automatically love canned baked beans. Always have some Heinz No Added Sugar in the cupboard to fall back on when desperate. 100g is just 66 calories with 4.6g protein, 3.6g fibre and basically no saturated fat. Throw a big dollop over some toast or a potato!

**Protein Powder** - A bunch of protein inside a bag of powder. You guys know the drill.

**Skyr** - Great for breakfast, great for a snack, great for dessert. There is a Skyr for every occasion and all other yog(h)urts are now obsolete for me.

**Muffin** - Muffins, or at least the ones I eat, are not at all 'healthy'. However, I'm happy to plan for almost 300 calories of muffin every couple days or so to keep my mind healthy. I'm fortunate to have a high TDEE so can get away with that without too much sacrifice elsewhere, but think everyone should have some occasional treats that can be worked into their calorie allowance.

**Fibre One Chocolate Fudge Brownie** - same idea as the muffin except it's a 90 calorie brownie. Not as big, satisfying or filling but not as much effort to fit into a day either.

**Instant Porridge Pots** - Oatmeal for the majority of you here. Add hot water and it's done. Not as good as 'proper' oats but I can grab a pot on my way out and make it at the office when I'm short on time.

**Quorn** - I'm not vegan or vegetarian but I'll always have time for Quorn. Many of their products are lower in calories, saturated fats and of course cholestrol than equivalent animal products, whilst often still having similar protein, fibre etc. Some of it does taste meh, but a lot tastes pretty good. I often use their 'chicken' fillets to fill out a meal, and currently have a pack of cocktail sausages in the fridge I slowly graze from.

**Water** - I didn't used to be a believer, but it is true liquids do indeed take up volume in your body for a while and you do indeed feel less hungry when you are drinking enough. It also turns out not being dehydrated feels pretty good.

**Diet Soda** - Water with taste (and some other stuff I guess). Not a frequent thing for me personally just because I've never been a huge soda drinker anyway. However, it is certainly a useful tool to trick my brain that I've had some sugar and curb some cravings. Also I like caffeine.

**Tea** - I'm British.

**Coffee** - It's not tea, but it has it's place. 

**Olive Oil** - Maybe a weird one and it's going to be far, far away from some people's list. For me though sometimes I overdo it with all the sensible food and have too few calories through the day and just don't have the appetite to avoid underfueling. Some more liberal use at dinner, without going too crazy, can be the 'free' bunch of healthy fats I need.",6,1742988279.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

First off, I just want to say that the VS3 really introduced me to the world of coffee. It was a gift from my girlfriend back in December 2022, meant to be a solid grinder to kickstart my coffee journey.

I‚Äôve seen posts about motor issues here and there, but I always thought I got lucky with my Gen 1. Unfortunately, after a little over two years and roughly 40‚Äì45 kg of medium-roasted coffee, my motor has now failed as well‚Äîwhich is pretty disappointing.

My plan was to keep using the grinder for another year or two before upgrading to something more high-end, but having it break down after just two years doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. I really hope they‚Äôll provide a replacement motor.

Has anyone had any luck recently with getting support for this issue without having to buy a new motor? Would love to hear your experiences‚Äîthanks in advance!

Having very recently arrived in Riyadh, I'm now starting to look for accommodation, probably an apartment on a compound for my wife (Filipino) and I (UK).  

  

I understand I am paying a significant premium for a compound but, I'm expecting this to include a gym, pool, cafe/coffee shop all on-site and, as it's a compound, my wife will not be so restricted with clothing.  

  

I'm looking for a 2 bed apartment (probably, given budget!) , furnished and where I'm able to purchase additional fast (fibre) internet.  The accommodation needs to be very near central Riyadh, with a leaning towards being *slightly* north or east (think Grenada Mall, within a couple of KM of this).

  
I've reached out to a bunch of compounds but so far, only 2 have responded - Almalga and Alfardan, both of which have responded are within budget and we are visiting next week.  I have seen Flow Narjis on maps but, this appears to far north.

  

Beyond these two, can you recommend any compounds within the rough area outlined and budget?  Ideally, if you have a contact that actually responds at those compounds that would also be awesome!  

  

Thank you

1jk99g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowBeforeBuy/comments/1jk99g0/a_beginners_guide_to_tea/,A Beginner's Guide to Tea,"If you had told me two years ago that I would be writing a Beginner's Guide to tea, I would have laughed. To me, tea wasn't a ""thing."" Sure, I drank it when I went to Chinese or Japanese restaurants, or I'd brew up a fruity, herbal tea when I wasn't feeling well during the long, cold winter months. And, of course, during summer, there was always a pitcher of iced tea in the fridge. But that was about the extent of tea in my life. Then one day, I wandered into a tea shop in the mall. There, on the back wall, were tin after tin of loose-leaf teas with names such as Monkey Picked Oolong, Silver Yin Zhen Pearls, Dragonwell, and Jasmine Dragon Phoenix Pearls. How could I not be intrigued? Seventy dollars and a bag full of teas later, I started on my journey of exploration into tea.

I don't claim to be an expert, or even all that knowledgeable on the subject of tea. That would be impossible in just 1 ¬Ω years. But I have learned a thing or two over the last 18 months, the greatest of which is that there is a lot of information out there‚Äîmuch of it contradictory and confusing. The second is that the tea world, just like the wine world, is full of snobs who will tell you that they know best and that if you listen to anyone else, you will never brew a great cup of tea. But while it's easy to encounter these snobs, as they tend to be the most vocal and visible, they are easily outnumbered by lots of others willing to share their meager knowledge to help a newbie navigate the world of tea. And that is what I hope to accomplish here. I want to demystify the world of tea for the beginner. This series of articles will help get you started on your own journey. In it, I will talk about the various types of tea, the best way to steep tea, how to store it, and other things that are important for beginners to know. I will not get into all the regional variations of tea types, except in the most general of ways. Once you have read all I have to say, hopefully, you will have enough knowledge to, at the very least, help you better enjoy tea. From there, it will be up to you to decide how far you want to go with it. Like with wine, you can spend a lifetime learning all you can about the various plantations, the products they produce, and how they differ from those around them.

# What Is Tea?

All tea, with the exception of herbal ""teas,"" comes from the same plant: *Camellia sinensis*. It is estimated that the plant has been used for making tea for over 5000 years and has been cultivated for at least the last 3000. The plant itself is an evergreen shrub or tree that is trimmed to keep it approximately 2-3 meters (6-9 feet) high. The leaves or leaf buds are picked at different stages and processed in different ways to produce the different varieties of tea. Much like wine, tea can exhibit ""terroir""‚Äîthose characteristics of the soil, geography, climate, etc., which shape and influence the flavor of tea. That is why a green tea from Japan can taste significantly different from a green tea from China, even if processed the same way. And just like with wines, the geographical leap does not need to be that huge. Plantations that are right next to each other can produce teas with differing flavor profiles depending on the soil composition and the microclimates.

Much of what makes one tea different from another is in how it is processed after it is picked. All teas go through a drying process at some point, but some, such as black and oolong teas, will go through a process to partially or completely oxidize the leaf. Some leaves will be steamed, some roasted, some rolled into tiny balls (called pearls) or into twists. And some will even go through a partial fermentation process and be aged for years before it is ready to drink.

To further add complexity to an already complex issue, tea can also be scented or flavored with a wide range of things. Many classic Asian-style teas are not flavored at all, while others are lightly scented‚Äîmost often with various flowers, jasmine being one of the most popular. In contrast, tea can merely be the vessel used to carry a myriad of flavors, such as Indian chai, redolent with spices such as cinnamon, clove, cardamom, and ginger, or modern Western tea blends full of sweet fruity flavors.

# Purchasing, Storing, and Brewing Tea

# Buying Tea: Where to Start?

When it comes to buying tea, you have two main options: loose-leaf or bagged. If you're just getting into tea, bagged tea might seem like the easiest option, but if you want the best flavor, loose-leaf is the way to go. Loose-leaf tea allows for better quality leaves, fuller flavor, and a more enjoyable experience overall. Many grocery stores carry a decent selection, but for the best experience, consider visiting a specialty tea shop or ordering from a reputable online retailer.

When selecting tea, consider starting with a sampler set. Many tea shops offer small tins or pouches of different types so you can explore without committing to a large quantity. If you're overwhelmed by choices, begin with a basic green, black, and oolong tea to understand the differences in flavor profiles.

# Storing Tea: Keeping It Fresh

Tea, like many consumables, has an optimal storage method to preserve its flavor. The key factors that can ruin tea are light, air, moisture, and strong odors. Store tea in an airtight container, preferably one that is opaque or kept in a dark cupboard. Avoid storing tea near coffee, spices, or other strong-smelling foods, as tea leaves can absorb surrounding odors. If stored properly, most teas can last for a year or more, though fresher is always better.

Green and white teas are more delicate and should ideally be consumed within six months to a year. Oolong and black teas have a longer shelf life and can remain flavorful for up to two years. Aged pu-erh teas, on the other hand, can actually improve with time, much like fine wine.

# Brewing Tea: The Basics

Brewing the perfect cup of tea isn‚Äôt as simple as dunking a bag in hot water. Different teas require different temperatures and steeping times. Here‚Äôs a general guide:

* **White tea:** 160‚Äì185¬∞F (70‚Äì85¬∞C), 3‚Äì5 minutes
* **Green tea:** 175‚Äì185¬∞F (80‚Äì85¬∞C), 2‚Äì3 minutes
* **Oolong tea:** 185‚Äì205¬∞F (85‚Äì96¬∞C), 3‚Äì5 minutes
* **Black tea:** 200‚Äì212¬∞F (93‚Äì100¬∞C), 3‚Äì5 minutes
* **Pu-erh tea:** 200‚Äì212¬∞F (93‚Äì100¬∞C), multiple short steeps

Using a thermometer or an electric kettle with temperature settings can help ensure the best results. If your tea turns out too bitter, try lowering the water temperature or reducing the steeping time.

For loose-leaf tea, using an infuser or a teapot with a built-in strainer will allow the leaves to expand fully, releasing their full flavor. A good rule of thumb is about 1 teaspoon of tea leaves per cup of water.",1,1742987512.0,KnowBeforeBuy,0,1.0,False

1jk9946,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1jk9946/singapore_showdown_gh_vs_andaz/,Singapore showdown: GH vs Andaz,"I've stayed at the Andaz Singapore twice, and now twice at the GH Singapore (both times since the renovation, so I don't know what it was like prior). Not a full review, but a few highlights:

The Andaz is a much smaller, quirkier hotel‚Äîthough still luxurious (or at least luxury-adjacent) and friendly. The GH is a vastly larger hotel (soon to be larger still) and with more luxurious touches than the Andaz. The bottom line up-front is that I like the Andaz, and would be happy to stay there if need be, but I've switched to the GH and have no intention of going back.

**Location**: The Andaz shares a skyscraper in the Bugis area. It's convenient for MRT access (you take the elevator all the way down below ground level and you're in a passageway that connects to the MRT). There are shops and restaurants at the main level of the complex, including a very nice casual French restaurant with a small French *√©picerie*. Walkability, though, is pretty poor. There's not much of interest nearby and the skyscraper complex is isolated from the street. The GH is next to the intersection of Scotts and Orchard Roads, and couldn't be any more perfectly located (from my standpoint). Multiple MRT lines pass by, and then you've got one of the better shopping districts at your doorstep, with the ION Orchard and Takashimaya shopping centers just across the street. Honestly, if you can't find something to buy here, just give up. ;-)

**Public spaces**: The Andaz doesn't really have much of a public space to speak of. There's a small elevator lobby at the driveway level, and you take it up to a high floor where check-in is located. That space just flows into the restaurant and caf√©, but it's all quite small. The GH has a massive and impressive lobby, with Straits Kitchen (all-day buffet dining, and where Globalists can have a full breakfast) and 10 Scotts (someday to be its own thing, temporarily serving as the club lounge until the full lounge is complete) just beyond. There's also a cute little coffee/sweets/booze shop just off to the side. My only complaint about the GH lobby is the lack of comfortable seating. If you're waiting for someone to show up, and looking for a place to sit that isn't a high-top... you won't find it here.

**Rooms**: The Andaz standard rooms are nice but a bit small for me. It feels like there's a narrow passageway around the bed and that's about it as far as space goes. On the other hand, they have a full complement of suites, and I was able to use a confirmed suite upgrade on one of my stays to book into a large room with plenty of space and expansive city views. The GH standard rooms are larger and more upscale (possibly simply as a result of being newer). However, the views from the currently open wing are just... they're not anything you want to look at. They're so bad that instead of windows looking out, there's a daybed that juts out from the room with sheers surrounding it. You can pull back the sheers but you're really not meant to. In other words, there will be no view from your room. Honestly, none. If you can live with that, though, you'll be extremely comfortable. Note that until the new wing opens sometime this year, there are no suites available for upgrades (at least as far as I know).

**Gym/pools**: I can't comment on this at the Andaz as I never used any of these while there. At the GH, though, I use the gym every day, and it's excellent‚Äîone of the best hotel gyms I've ever seen. An excellent array of cardio and weight training equipment. My favorite part is that after my workout, I walk out from the gym in the direction of the pools. They've created an urban forest there, and I can always find a place to sit in peace and do my mindfulness work while enjoying nature. It absolutely doesn't feel like you're in the middle of a bustling city. I haven't used the pools, but a friend who did, who is big on swimming while traveling, told me they were excellent (as they certainly looked to be).

**Service**: This is highly subjective, but I'd say that the service at the Andaz is good but not incredible. It's understated and casual in the Andaz manner. The service at the GH feels more like a traditional hotel and I mean that in the best possible way.

**Not covered here**: Restaurants (though GH would handily win), spa (I haven't used either so can't comment), room service (both are about what you'd expect).

1jk97xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1jk97xi/kendu_a_billion_dollar_project/,Kendu - A Billion Dollar Project,"**Kendu Overview**

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  
Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.  
Kendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu's IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.  
It is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.  
Kendu reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...

Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:üáÆüá≥¬†India,üá™üá∏¬†Spanish,üá¶üá™¬†Arabic, üá´üá∑¬†French, üá©üá™¬†German, üáµüáπ¬†Portuguese, üá∑üá∫¬†Russian, üá®üá≥¬†Chinese, üáØüáµ¬†Japanese, üáÆüá©¬†Indonesian, üá∞üá∑¬†Korean, üáπüá≠¬†Thai, üáπüá∑¬†Turkish, üáøüá¶¬†Zulu.

**IRL Products and Event**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

**Miami Music Week**

In 2 days Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  
Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!  
NoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.

**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**

A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???  
Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  
Skip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  
All the signs were there...

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

1jk97nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jk97nz/my_sil_married_a_man_who_leaves_a_mess_everywhere/,My SIL married a man who leaves a mess everywhere & it really hurts the dynamic and mental health of my family-in-law,"My SIL (25F) recently had a baby with her husband (30M). I think he is a pretty good person, but he is an acting like a child when it comes to household chores. He doesn‚Äôt do anything, even though both have worked full-time. I know that they broke up for a few weeks in the past over this, but they got back together and my fianc√© and I just assumed that he had bettered himself. My fianc√© (27M) and I (26F) live in a different country, so we did not have that much insight. We recently visited my fianc√©‚Äôs family and were horrified about what we learned:

My SIL and her husband usually stay with my parents in law over the weekend. 
My parents in law were very tired and a little hostile/annoyed towards her husband. In a calm minute, I asked my MIL what‚Äôs wrong and she poured out her heart: she is just fed up with my SIL‚Äôs husband. My MiL working 50+ hours a week, helping my SIL with the baby, does all household chores (my fianc√© and I helped a lot of course during visiting). She is just asking him to keep his things clean, but he can‚Äôt even do that. He is leaving the guest room with 10+ empty bottles, he is using 3 towels a day (no exaggeration) - so they always run out of towels when they are there, uses up the warm water when he showers, throws the pillows off the couch everytime he wants to lie down on it, he leaves his things everywhere across the house, leaves dirty dishes on the sink without ever cleaning or loading/emptying the dishwasher, (sometimes even just takes my fianc√©‚Äôs clothes and claims they are his),‚Ä¶ he just sits in the bed or on the sofa all weekend - now but also before the baby came. And it got worse and worse. All conversations with him didn‚Äôt help at all, my SIL is regularly fighting with him about it but nothing changes. 

The week the baby came, my SIL lived with her parents, her husband was alone at home for that week and left the flag in absolute chaos - I am talking dishes with unfinished food in every room, days-old coffee etc.

I really want to help my SIL and MIL, the whole family is stressed about this and suffering. I just find his behaviour very disrespectful, it also affects  my fianc√© and me because we have to do more house chores as a consequence of his mess and because we don‚Äôt have towels or hot water after he showered.

Do you have any advice on this situation?

My MIL says she can‚Äôt really tell him not to come because she wants to see her daughter and grandchild. I said she can‚Äôt only invite the two and say the husband is not allowed to come unless he learns to clean up after himself. My MiL says she can‚Äôt do that. I suggested that my SIL talks to him, but apparently this always ends up in a fight without any changes afterwards. 
Also, the two are renting a flat that‚Äôs owned by my fianc√© and me. I thought about telling them that if the flat is not kept clean, we would have to   end the lease, so for once in his life, he would feel the consequences to his behaviour. But I would never follow through and throw my SIL and the baby out. Also, I think he wouldn‚Äôt change and my SIL would probably be the one cleaning everything again. 
So do you have any advice? 

Also, we my fianc√© and I get married this year and this problem seems to suck lots of the energy and good mood out of my family-in-law.

TLdR: my SIL‚Äôs husband (30M) leaves a mess everywhere, also in my parents‚Äôs in law house and it‚Äôs driving the whole family mad. Conversations and fights don‚Äôt help. Advice?

1jk96ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jk96ob/amita_for_my_behaviour_in_my_relationship/,AMITA for my behaviour in my relationship?,"In October last year I (35M) started a relationship with my current gf (26F). We have been knowing each other for 2 years and allways had a very good connection. Sharing jokes, moments, constantly apping each other. It was nice. We were both in a relationship and I'm a temporary contractor, so things thit not start out naturally.

Last year at some moment she started asking future-related questions. For somehow that gave me the courage to grab her hand during a movie date. She grabbed by arm and we started this journey.

She has ADHD, PTSD and probably also other behavioral problems as her father commited suicide when she was a kid. Her brother is autistic and has also tried suicide 2 times which makes her very anxious and her mother is terminally ill and she is now caregiver also. For her her father is important. Her profile pic is an old photo of her as a kid and her father. When I showed her the list of important days in our love story she said that I forgot the most important one and typed the death date of her father. So that's her background. Furthermore we both work at the same place and have a very busy job between January and April which is kinda ending now. Plus she has studies. Chronologically some important events:

\- One month everything was like a dream. We made future plans, bucket lists, couldn't wait to see each other, texted literally all day. Completely in love. We told our families the first week about each other. We told it at our workplace. Nobody surprised given our bond and they were allready making jokes about us for a long time. We were making a bucket list with future plans, and She told me she didn't see me as a boyfriend, but she started thinking about her life and she realized she maybe found the special one without realizing. We shared moments from the past where there were hints abour our love for each other, it felt special. And then began the problems....

\- When at office during our first weeks I got a friend proposal on facebook. I didn't notice who it was and then I realized it was a mutual friend of my girlfriend, one of her exes she talked about. I saw a picture of them together which was for public, I misunderstood the date and thought it was 2023 instead of 2021 and she was lying to me. I messaged her I saw something and I went cold. She called, I didn't take the call. Then I saw I misunderstood. I called her, I apologised, she said she stopped crying and it was fine.

\- Our first 'event/'date'' as an unofficiel couple was at a casino. At a roulette table she mentioned  that her ex allways puts at zero. I was overwhelmed cause in a first date with your bf it is weird to mention your ex at all. I felt silent and my facial expression changed. She noticed and asked what happened, I told her it was unnecessary to mention her ex. She said sorry and we went further. I forgot, but apparently she didn't.

\- In November she got her master degree diploma. I took her out for dinner, bought her a gift and congratulated her. I officially asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. She seemed happy.

\- We went on a weekend trip to Berlin. Our first trip together. It was all fine and good. Except for the morning where we woke up. She just turned her back and was scrolling on her phone. For 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins.... At some point I got bothered and asked her if it wouldn't be better to cuddle given we have limited time together? She said ok. I thought it wasn't a strange question to ask. Months later she brought it up as a conflict. I realized later that needing alone time for a person with ADHD was relevant and that I should have left her. But she never mentioned this. She didn't do that with so many things. In the road back I asked her about her Christmas plans and dinner together to meet her family. She mentioned that her brother would be probably working and 

\- Then came December. We planned a long weekend trip. I wrote a nice Christmas gift card. She sent me a voice message the day before her mother broke her hand and she had to cancel. I said shit happens, told her she needs to focus on her mom and studies and I'm there for her. The next day I visited her to console her and that it would be nice to go one day away for a Christmas market. That was when she opened to me the first time. The evening before I asked her how late I should come given she visits her mom every morning. She didn't mentioned a specific time. I asked again given I wanted to swim before and want to know the time slot, she again didn't mention and said I can come whenever ready. I told her around 11-1130 and I would send her a message when I would leave. I came back home later than thought, it was around 1130 allready and I was preparing myself, my phone was on whatsapp. Meanwhile she apped twice if I was on my way. I didn't see it as I was busy and I sent her a voice message when I got on the road, around 11.45 I saw. When I got there she had put on meditation music. The day was fine, but when driving back she asked if I did see she put off her whatsapp status. I didn't see it, she asked if we could talk. Back home she started crying, saying that she stressed because I didn't answer. That she stresses when I'm online and don't answer her messages which triggers doom thinking. Or that she stresses when I message her that she didn't respond on time etc. (never accused her of such a thing). That putting last seen and online off would help her. I was surprised, but I didn't make a point of it, said she should do that if it helps her and consoled her. She received my Christmas card and was happy with it, her heart was warm.

\- Then came January, our busy season. I sat down with her and told her that it is gonna be tough. Both working hard, having a lot overtime, being stressed. We agreed upon 1 day a week at least to keep the relationship going. She said she abuses her friends during busy season and doesn't care. She also quitted sports. I wanted to tell her she works a lot and it isn't healthy, but I did not want to interfere. I let it going. The Fridays became our day where she would come after studies and sleep over.

\- Early January we had an extra date on Monday. I bought her two gifts she liked during out Christmas trip. She was very happy with it, we very happy. A couple of weeks later she returned the gift and made me happy. But from this point on it became more difficult.

\- I have not been a person who expresses emotions a lot, like most men. The Christmas card was one of them. I was preparing a book with our story, all from the beginning and our future activities, what I like about her etc. I wanted to give it to her as a Valentine's day present. I asked her if she could reserve her agenda for Valentine's Day and her birthday. She told that Valentine's Day wasn't special for her. I just wanted to give her some extra love and attention and prepared something in my head and I got such a reaction, it felt wrong. I questioned and she felt attacked, some verbal conflict and then we agreed we could do something together but not commercial. I changed my mind and bought her something else, I changed the book to be a birthday present instead.

\- The dynamics started changing. I did not send many loving emoji's, she neither. We started texting less, most stuff coming from my side. At some point I was fed and I decided not to text her at all. She did not text me for 4 days. Not a single word, not on whatsapp and not on our work chat. That day I got out of office and saw her outside, she came to office for overtime. She has been carefull around colleagues and I was cold, so I just said hi and walked past her, she pulled me towards her and kissed me. I was surprised, didn't expect that. I messaged her on teams if we could go home together, that's fine. Outside she hugged me and said she was very tired. Tired of work, her mom, studies. She was happy she didn't feel the urge to be social around me. And that her social battery is empty, she doesn't app anyone at all. It felt better for her to not app at all, not get stressed and see me on Friday when things are better when we see each other. Ok, I accept that. She also told that the one appointment she had on Friday this week but she cancelled to see me.

\- That Friday we went out for dinner (this is around 3 weeks ago). I was vasting and we were late. Her food came, mines didn't yet. She just started eating. I expect her to give me just one piece from her plate, she didn't. I felt really really bad, I didn't make a comment. We walked home and spent a normal evening. I asked her if everything is ok. She said everything is fine but sex is a huge thing. Our sexual life wasn't good. At our first dates she was horny. Literally let me finger herself in the movie theater, car, she was horny. We purposedly waited to have sex and when we had I couldn't come as there was time pressure. We were sexting till that point but in the bedroom she didn't show me that performance. I told her I like foreplay and oral, we hadn't really foreplay. She provided oral the first time and months later when I asked for it. But she acted really disstant in bed. Just asking from me to get hard without any stimulation, fuck and leave her. That behaviour combined with relationship problems, her disstant behaviour, only having sex on friday after a full workweek and stress on work, and performance anxiety didn't make it easier. Sometimes I went soft after penetration, sometimes I couldn't get hard. I never thought she saw it as a problem untill she mentioned. I saw it as a problem, but was hoping that after busy season and relieving stress it would be better. 

\- The day after I texted her how she is and she fixed everything she was planning. With a love emoji and a sticker of us together. She acted with 'heeeeey good and yourself'.  And that moment I did break. She never called me like this, as if I was a buddy. A couple of weeks ago I mentioned her by her name accidentally, she asked me to now do that as it is weird, I said ok and never did. This was the same category. I didn't want to react angry. I only said 'heeeeey'? She reacted with that was an 'e' too much. It felt as a very weird reaction to me. I said oops my bad and called her name. She read it and didn't react. The next morning I sent her a big text how unhappy I was, how cold I felt, how emitionally disstant she was and that I didn't even now she cared. She said we should discuss this not by whatsapp and why I thought she wouldn't care given she is my girlfriend. We discussed with no result. She again said she was stressed as she felt she she couldn't app me, didn't explain further, I explained my thoughts, no results. Day after I texted, said her I want to see her. Visited her Thursday evening. She said that she was unhappy, this isn't how a relationship should be, she was continuously stressed about everything. She has doubt about the future and her feeling is allmost gone. She just doesn't feel as in October. We didn't come to a conclusion. She kissed me goodbye. I sent her a message that night I was home. She reacted in the middle of the night. She has exams on Tuesday so she was studying also. I told her I felt bad and we could discuss after her exam. She apped me it's better she doesn't come on Friday as she didn't feel chill and has to study, I said it's ok. I would not bother her untill Tuesday and I didn't. That Sunday evening she sent a message if I was ok and how work went. I was mentally really broken those 3 days, totally broken. I called her, she answered, told her I was totally down and need to speak to her. I went to her place, also including the book I made for her burthday. I threw out everything. How much I love her, how anxious I was during the start of our relationship, how big my feelings for her were, all the stuff that was in the book and I never said. She reacted quite cold, just told me why I didn't do that during the last 3 months and didn't act vulnerable. How different I actuallyy was of the guy she knew for 2 years who was really chill-down and didn't give a fuck. She has to process this. I left the book with her and told her my feelings have allways been there, I'm just having difficulties expressing it. And the book tells everything. She told me she would read after her exams.

\- The days after we texted on work, just normal chit-chat. She was busy, I was busy. I was wondering what she would do. I asked her if she wanted anything special for Friday. She said she didn't need anything and she would call me after studies. I expected her to break-up, she didn't. She told me that she doesn't feel well and good enough to come at me and sleep, that she can't act as if nothing happened. I understood. I told her there are 3 options, break-up, give a break or come together and talk. She said that a break-up at this point was too harsh, she needed time to recover and think. It was a good conversation, we joked here and there and it was ok. We understood each other. We also talked about the circumstances which are not ideal. We agreed. I told her I would not bother her. I asked her if we can chat and she said just random chit-chat here and there is fine. I didn't chat her and wanted to leave her.

\- On Monday she was also at office. This is actually this Monday. She acted weird. She saw me twice and went back. She didn't say even hi. I was devastated. We can have problems but acting like this is very very bad. In the morning I was getting coffee, she came out of her room, I saw her through the mirror. She saw me and head back immediately. I felt really bad. Later on I was in a meeting with others, she walked by and waved at me, I smiled back. Later on I was in a meeting room on my own. She came to the pantry to grab some fruits. I saw she saw me, hesitated to come to me and went back. I felt strange. I chatted her for the first time that day and told her I thought she hesitated, I was in a meeting and she could come in. She said she didn't see me and just grabbed fruit. Weird, there is a distance of 2 meters. Later on she walked by our room with her team and didn't even look at me. We also have mutual friends in my team, she didn't even come into our room to say hi. Even my colleagues did think it was really weird. I felt really bad. I was pissed and decided to ask for an explanation. Went to her room and asked if we could talk. We talked, I told her the situation was awkward. She agreed but didn't give an explanation. I asked her what she meant with needing time cause I didn't want to wait for months in such a situation. She just wanted my deadline to finish (which is this week) and her deadline (she finishes Thursday) and then she wanted to think during the weekend which is also her birthday. I said that's fine. Told her I care about her and her well being and even if we break up I think about her health. She said it's just all too much and started crying, I consoled her. I said sorry for this as this was not my intention, she said she was doing fine untill she saw me and her day is bad again. We then split up. I discussed with my colleagues, one of them saw me also hugging her. They also said she didn't need to act like that childish in amy circumstance and she should just come and say at least hi. I agreed.  We can have conflicts and she can feel bad, but I never yelled at her, never insulted her, never threatened her. This is how you behave towards someone you hate. I sent her first a message, then deleted and a voice message in the night saying how bad her behaviour is, all the frustrations I spoke out. She didn't see as she was sleeping. I regretted and deleted the messages. She asked in the morning what I deleted. I explained I felt bad yesterday and reacted, but then I regret as it is not necessary to act now out of emotions and that we should calm down and talk. She didn't read. I didn't send her a message on our work chat, she also didn't. Maybe she is angry, maybe she if focussing on her assignment. She is weird with social media anyway. During busy days she only reads her whatsapp in the morning and when going to bad, during workdays even puts herself sometimes out of office even to concentrate. Maybe an ADHD thing, don't know. We didn't have any contact since Monday.

I' m mentally down. Just sick of her behaviour. Monday felt like a border was crossed. Having a rational conversation on Friday like adults and seeing this childish behaviour on Monday is weird. I just don't know it anymore. I don't know what to feel, what to think, how to fix if she doesn't fucking communicate. I don't know anymore. One part of me says break-up and get out of it. Another part of me says, it all comes down to communication, lack of time and external pressures and stress which made both of us act like this. Our communication during our 2 days friendship was perfect and our feelings in October were pure. I really don't know what to think, what she will do, how I should react, I don't know.

AITAH in this process?

How should I talk with her when she calls out on Friday or if she doesn't at all?

We have been knowing each other for 2 years and allways had a very good connection. Sharing jokes, moments, constantly apping each other. It was nice. We were both in a relationship and I'm a temporary contractor, so things thit not start out naturally.

Last year at some moment she started asking future-related questions. For somehow that gave me the courage to grab her hand during a movie date. She grabbed by arm and we started this journey.

She has ADHD, PTSD and probably also other behavioral problems as her father commited suicide when she was a kid. Her brother is autistic and has also tried suicide 2 times which makes her very anxious and her mother is terminally ill and she is now caregiver also. For her her father is important. Her profile pic is an old photo of her as a kid and her father. When I showed her the list of important days in our love story she said that I forgot the most important one and typed the death date of her father. So that's her background. Furthermore we both work at the same place and have a very busy job between January and April which is kinda ending now. Plus she has studies. Chronologically some important events:

\- One month everything was like a dream. We made future plans, bucket lists, couldn't wait to see each other, texted literally all day. Completely in love. We told our families the first week about each other. We told it at our workplace. Nobody surprised given our bond and they were allready making jokes about us for a long time. We were making a bucket list with future plans, and She told me she didn't see me as a boyfriend, but she started thinking about her life and she realized she maybe found the special one without realizing. We shared moments from the past where there were hints abour our love for each other, it felt special. And then began the problems....

\- When at office during our first weeks I got a friend proposal on facebook. I didn't notice who it was and then I realized it was a mutual friend of my girlfriend, one of her exes she talked about. I saw a picture of them together which was for public, I misunderstood the date and thought it was 2023 instead of 2021 and she was lying to me. I messaged her I saw something and I went cold. She called, I didn't take the call. Then I saw I misunderstood. I called her, I apologised, she said she stopped crying and it was fine.

\- Our first 'event/'date'' as an unofficiel couple was at a casino. At a roulette table she mentioned  that her ex allways puts at zero. I was overwhelmed cause in a first date with your bf it is weird to mention your ex at all. I felt silent and my facial expression changed. She noticed and asked what happened, I told her it was unnecessary to mention her ex. She said sorry and we went further. I forgot, but apparently she didn't.

\- In November she got her master degree diploma. I took her out for dinner, bought her a gift and congratulated her. I officially asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. She seemed happy.

\- We went on a weekend trip to Berlin. Our first trip together. It was all fine and good. Except for the morning where we woke up. She just turned her back and was scrolling on her phone. For 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins.... At some point I got bothered and asked her if it wouldn't be better to cuddle given we have limited time together? She said ok. I thought it wasn't a strange question to ask. Months later she brought it up as a conflict. I realized later that needing alone time for a person with ADHD was relevant and that I should have left her. But she never mentioned this. She didn't do that with so many things. In the road back I asked her about her Christmas plans and dinner together to meet her family. She mentioned that her brother would be probably working and 

\- Then came December. We planned a long weekend trip. I wrote a nice Christmas gift card. She sent me a voice message the day before her mother broke her hand and she had to cancel. I said shit happens, told her she needs to focus on her mom and studies and I'm there for her. The next day I visited her to console her and that it would be nice to go one day away for a Christmas market. That was when she opened to me the first time. The evening before I asked her how late I should come given she visits her mom every morning. She didn't mentioned a specific time. I asked again given I wanted to swim before and want to know the time slot, she again didn't mention and said I can come whenever ready. I told her around 11-1130 and I would send her a message when I would leave. I came back home later than thought, it was around 1130 allready and I was preparing myself, my phone was on whatsapp. Meanwhile she apped twice if I was on my way. I didn't see it as I was busy and I sent her a voice message when I got on the road, around 11.45 I saw. When I got there she had put on meditation music. The day was fine, but when driving back she asked if I did see she put off her whatsapp status. I didn't see it, she asked if we could talk. Back home she started crying, saying that she stressed because I didn't answer. That she stresses when I'm online and don't answer her messages which triggers doom thinking. Or that she stresses when I message her that she didn't respond on time etc. (never accused her of such a thing). That putting last seen and online off would help her. I was surprised, but I didn't make a point of it, said she should do that if it helps her and consoled her. She received my Christmas card and was happy with it, her heart was warm.

\- Then came January, our busy season. I sat down with her and told her that it is gonna be tough. Both working hard, having a lot overtime, being stressed. We agreed upon 1 day a week at least to keep the relationship going. She said she abuses her friends during busy season and doesn't care. She also quitted sports. I wanted to tell her she works a lot and it isn't healthy, but I did not want to interfere. I let it going. The Fridays became our day where she would come after studies and sleep over.

\- Early January we had an extra date on Monday. I bought her two gifts she liked during out Christmas trip. She was very happy with it, we very happy. A couple of weeks later she returned the gift and made me happy. But from this point on it became more difficult.

\- I have not been a person who expresses emotions a lot, like most men. The Christmas card was one of them. I was preparing a book with our story, all from the beginning and our future activities, what I like about her etc. I wanted to give it to her as a Valentine's day present. I asked her if she could reserve her agenda for Valentine's Day and her birthday. She told that Valentine's Day wasn't special for her. I just wanted to give her some extra love and attention and prepared something in my head and I got such a reaction, it felt wrong. I questioned and she felt attacked, some verbal conflict and then we agreed we could do something together but not commercial. I changed my mind and bought her something else, I changed the book to be a birthday present instead.

\- The dynamics started changing. I did not send many loving emoji's, she neither. We started texting less, most stuff coming from my side. At some point I was fed and I decided not to text her at all. She did not text me for 4 days. Not a single word, not on whatsapp and not on our work chat. That day I got out of office and saw her outside, she came to office for overtime. She has been carefull around colleagues and I was cold, so I just said hi and walked past her, she pulled me towards her and kissed me. I was surprised, didn't expect that. I messaged her on teams if we could go home together, that's fine. Outside she hugged me and said she was very tired. Tired of work, her mom, studies. She was happy she didn't feel the urge to be social around me. And that her social battery is empty, she doesn't app anyone at all. It felt better for her to not app at all, not get stressed and see me on Friday when things are better when we see each other. Ok, I accept that. She also told that the one appointment she had on Friday this week but she cancelled to see me.

\- That Friday we went out for dinner (this is around 3 weeks ago). I was vasting and we were late. Her food came, mines didn't yet. She just started eating. I expect her to give me just one piece from her plate, she didn't. I felt really really bad, I didn't make a comment. We walked home and spent a normal evening. I asked her if everything is ok. She said everything is fine but sex is a huge thing. Our sexual life wasn't good. At our first dates she was horny. Literally let me finger herself in the movie theater, car, she was horny. We purposedly waited to have sex and when we had I couldn't come as there was time pressure. We were sexting till that point but in the bedroom she didn't show me that performance. I told her I like foreplay and oral, we hadn't really foreplay. She provided oral the first time and months later when I asked for it. But she acted really disstant in bed. Just asking from me to get hard without any stimulation, fuck and leave her. That behaviour combined with relationship problems, her disstant behaviour, only having sex on friday after a full workweek and stress on work, and performance anxiety didn't make it easier. Sometimes I went soft after penetration, sometimes I couldn't get hard. I never thought she saw it as a problem untill she mentioned. I saw it as a problem, but was hoping that after busy season and relieving stress it would be better. 

\- The day after I texted her how she is and she fixed everything she was planning. With a love emoji and a sticker of us together. She acted with 'heeeeey good and yourself'.  And that moment I did break. She never called me like this, as if I was a buddy. A couple of weeks ago I mentioned her by her name accidentally, she asked me to now do that as it is weird, I said ok and never did. This was the same category. I didn't want to react angry. I only said 'heeeeey'? She reacted with that was an 'e' too much. It felt as a very weird reaction to me. I said oops my bad and called her name. She read it and didn't react. The next morning I sent her a big text how unhappy I was, how cold I felt, how emitionally disstant she was and that I didn't even now she cared. She said we should discuss this not by whatsapp and why I thought she wouldn't care given she is my girlfriend. We discussed with no result. She again said she was stressed as she felt she she couldn't app me, didn't explain further, I explained my thoughts, no results. Day after I texted, said her I want to see her. Visited her Thursday evening. She said that she was unhappy, this isn't how a relationship should be, she was continuously stressed about everything. She has doubt about the future and her feeling is allmost gone. She just doesn't feel as in October. We didn't come to a conclusion. She kissed me goodbye. I sent her a message that night I was home. She reacted in the middle of the night. She has exams on Tuesday so she was studying also. I told her I felt bad and we could discuss after her exam. She apped me it's better she doesn't come on Friday as she didn't feel chill and has to study, I said it's ok. I would not bother her untill Tuesday and I didn't. That Sunday evening she sent a message if I was ok and how work went. I was mentally really broken those 3 days, totally broken. I called her, she answered, told her I was totally down and need to speak to her. I went to her place, also including the book I made for her burthday. I threw out everything. How much I love her, how anxious I was during the start of our relationship, how big my feelings for her were, all the stuff that was in the book and I never said. She reacted quite cold, just told me why I didn't do that during the last 3 months and didn't act vulnerable. How different I actuallyy was of the guy she knew for 2 years who was really chill-down and didn't give a fuck. She has to process this. I left the book with her and told her my feelings have allways been there, I'm just having difficulties expressing it. And the book tells everything. She told me she would read after her exams.

\- The days after we texted on work, just normal chit-chat. She was busy, I was busy. I was wondering what she would do. I asked her if she wanted anything special for Friday. She said she didn't need anything and she would call me after studies. I expected her to break-up, she didn't. She told me that she doesn't feel well and good enough to come at me and sleep, that she can't act as if nothing happened. I understood. I told her there are 3 options, break-up, give a break or come together and talk. She said that a break-up at this point was too harsh, she needed time to recover and think. It was a good conversation, we joked here and there and it was ok. We understood each other. We also talked about the circumstances which are not ideal. We agreed. I told her I would not bother her. I asked her if we can chat and she said just random chit-chat here and there is fine. I didn't chat her and wanted to leave her.

\- On Monday she was also at office. This is actually this Monday. She acted weird. She saw me twice and went back. She didn't say even hi. I was devastated. We can have problems but acting like this is very very bad. In the morning I was getting coffee, she came out of her room, I saw her through the mirror. She saw me and head back immediately. I felt really bad. Later on I was in a meeting with others, she walked by and waved at me, I smiled back. Later on I was in a meeting room on my own. She came to the pantry to grab some fruits. I saw she saw me, hesitated to come to me and went back. I felt strange. I chatted her for the first time that day and told her I thought she hesitated, I was in a meeting and she could come in. She said she didn't see me and just grabbed fruit. Weird, there is a distance of 2 meters. Later on she walked by our room with her team and didn't even look at me. We also have mutual friends in my team, she didn't even come into our room to say hi. Even my colleagues did think it was really weird. I felt really bad. I was pissed and decided to ask for an explanation. Went to her room and asked if we could talk. We talked, I told her the situation was awkward. She agreed but didn't give an explanation. I asked her what she meant with needing time cause I didn't want to wait for months in such a situation. She just wanted my deadline to finish (which is this week) and her deadline (she finishes Thursday) and then she wanted to think during the weekend which is also her birthday. I said that's fine. Told her I care about her and her well being and even if we break up I think about her health. She said it's just all too much and started crying, I consoled her. I said sorry for this as this was not my intention, she said she was doing fine untill she saw me and her day is bad again. We then split up. I discussed with my colleagues, one of them saw me also hugging her. They also said she didn't need to act like that childish in amy circumstance and she should just come and say at least hi. I agreed.  We can have conflicts and she can feel bad, but I never yelled at her, never insulted her, never threatened her. This is how you behave towards someone you hate. I sent her first a message, then deleted and a voice message in the night saying how bad her behaviour is, all the frustrations I spoke out. She didn't see as she was sleeping. I regretted and deleted the messages. She asked in the morning what I deleted. I explained I felt bad yesterday and reacted, but then I regret as it is not necessary to act now out of emotions and that we should calm down and talk. She didn't read. I didn't send her a message on our work chat, she also didn't. Maybe she is angry, maybe she if focussing on her assignment. She is weird with social media anyway. During busy days she only reads her whatsapp in the morning and when going to bad, during workdays even puts herself sometimes out of office even to concentrate. Maybe an ADHD thing, don't know. We didn't have any contact since Monday.

I' m mentally down. Just sick of her behaviour. Monday felt like a border was crossed. Having a rational conversation on Friday like adults and seeing this childish behaviour on Monday is weird. I just don't know it anymore. I don't know what to feel, what to think, how to fix if she doesn't fucking communicate. I don't know anymore. One part of me says break-up and get out of it.

Our communication during our 2 days friendship was perfect and our feelings in October were pure. I really don't know what to think, what she will do, how I should react, I don't know.

Just need some general advice relating to her behaviour/reasons and what to do?

I think he is a pretty good person, but he is an absolute man-child when it comes to household chores. He doesn‚Äôt do anything, even though both have worked full-time. I know that they broke up for a few weeks in the past over this, but they got back together and my fianc√© and I just assumed that he had bettered himself. My fianc√© (27M) and I (26F) live in a different country, so we did not have that much insight. We recently visited my fianc√©‚Äôs family and were horrified about what we learned:

My SIL and her husband usually stay with my parents in law over the weekend. 
My parents in law were very tired and a little hostile/annoyed towards her husband. In a calm minute, I asked my MIL what‚Äôs wrong and she poured out her heart: she is just fed up with my SIL‚Äôs husband. My MiL working 50+ hours a week, helping my SIL with the baby, does all household chores (my fianc√© and I helped a lot of course during visiting). She is just asking him to keep his things clean, but he can‚Äôt even do that. He is leaving the guest room with 10+ empty bottles, he is using 3 towels a day (no exaggeration) - so they always run out of towels when they are there, uses up the warm water when he showers, throws the pillows off the couch everytime he wants to lie down on it, he leaves his things everywhere across the house, leaves dirty dishes on the sink without ever cleaning or loading/emptying the dishwasher, (sometimes even just takes my fianc√©‚Äôs clothes and claims they are his),‚Ä¶ he just sits in the bed or on the sofa all weekend - now but also before the baby came. And it got worse and worse. All conversations with him didn‚Äôt help at all, my SIL is regularly fighting with him about it but nothing changes. 

The week the baby came, my SIL lived with her parents, her husband was alone at home for that week and left the flag in absolute chaos - I am talking dishes with unfinished food in every room, days-old coffee etc.

I really want to help my SIL and MIL, the whole family is stressed about this and suffering. I just find his behaviour very disrespectful, it also affects  my fianc√© and me because we have to do more house chores as a consequence of his mess and because we don‚Äôt have towels or hot water after he showered.

Do you have any advice on this situation?

My MIL says she can‚Äôt really tell him not to come because she wants to see her daughter and grandchild. I said she can‚Äôt only invite the two and say the husband is not allowed to come unless he learns to clean up after himself. My MiL says she can‚Äôt do that. I suggested that my SIL talks to him, but apparently this always ends up in a fight without any changes afterwards. 
Also, the two are renting a flat that‚Äôs owned by my fianc√© and me. I thought about telling them that if the flat is not kept clean, we would have to   end the lease, so for once in his life, he would feel the consequences to his behaviour. But I would never follow through and throw my SIL and the baby out. Also, I think he wouldn‚Äôt change and my SIL would probably be the one cleaning everything again. 
So do you have any advice? 

TLdR: my SIL‚Äôs husband (30M) leaves a mess everywhere, also in my parents‚Äôs in law house and it‚Äôs driving the whole family mad. Conversations and fights don‚Äôt help. Advice?

At some point I was fed and I decided not to text her at all. She did not text me for 4 days. Not a single word, not on whatsapp and not on our work chat. That day I got out of office and saw her outside, she came to office for overtime. She has been carefull around colleagues and I was cold, so I just said hi and walked past her, she pulled me towards her and kissed me. I was surprised, didn't expect that. I messaged her on teams if we could go home together, that's fine. Outside she hugged me and said she was very tired. Tired of work, her mom, studies. She was happy she didn't feel the urge to be social around me. And that her social battery is empty, she doesn't app anyone at all. It felt better for her to not app at all, not get stressed and see me on Friday when things are better when we see each other. Ok, I accept that. She also told that the one appointment she had on Friday this week but she cancelled to see me.

\- That Friday we went out for dinner (this is around 3 weeks ago). I was vasting and we were late. Her food came, mines didn't yet. She just started eating. I expect her to give me just one piece from her plate, she didn't. I felt really really bad, I didn't make a comment. We walked home and spent a normal evening. I asked her if everything is ok. She said everything is fine but sex is a huge thing. Our sexual life wasn't good. At our first dates she was horny. Literally let me finger herself in the movie theater, car, she was horny. We purposedly waited to have sex and when we had I couldn't come as there was time pressure. We were sexting till that point but in the bedroom she didn't show me that performance. I told her I like foreplay and oral, we hadn't really foreplay. She provided oral the first time and months later when I asked for it. But she acted really disstant in bed. Just asking from me to get hard without any stimulation, fuck and leave her. That behaviour combined with relationship problems, her disstant behaviour, only having sex on friday after a full workweek and stress on work, and performance anxiety didn't make it easier. Sometimes I went soft after penetration, sometimes I couldn't get hard. I never thought she saw it as a problem untill she mentioned. I saw it as a problem, but was hoping that after busy season and relieving stress it would be better. 

\- The day after I texted her how she is and she fixed everything she was planning. With a love emoji and a sticker of us together. She acted with 'heeeeey good and yourself'.  And that moment I did break. She never called me like this, as if I was a buddy. A couple of weeks ago I mentioned her by her name accidentally, she asked me to now do that as it is weird, I said ok and never did. This was the same category. I didn't want to react angry. I only said 'heeeeey'? She reacted with that was an 'e' too much. It felt as a very weird reaction to me. I said oops my bad and called her name. She read it and didn't react. The next morning I sent her a big text how unhappy I was, how cold I felt, how emitionally disstant she was and that I didn't even now she cared. She said we should discuss this not by whatsapp and why I thought she wouldn't care given she is my girlfriend. We discussed with no result. She again said she was stressed as she felt she she couldn't app me, didn't explain further, I explained my thoughts, no results. Day after I texted, said her I want to see her. Visited her Thursday evening. She said that she was unhappy, this isn't how a relationship should be, she was continuously stressed about everything. She has doubt about the future and her feeling is allmost gone. She just doesn't feel as in October. We didn't come to a conclusion. She kissed me goodbye. I sent her a message that night I was home. She reacted in the middle of the night. She has exams on Tuesday so she was studying also. I told her I felt bad and we could discuss after her exam. She apped me it's better she doesn't come on Friday as she didn't feel chill and has to study, I said it's ok. I would not bother her untill Tuesday and I didn't. That Sunday evening she sent a message if I was ok and how work went. I was mentally really broken those 3 days, totally broken. I called her, she answered, told her I was totally down and need to speak to her. I went to her place, also including the book I made for her burthday. I threw out everything. How much I love her, how anxious I was during the start of our relationship, how big my feelings for her were, all the stuff that was in the book and I never said. She reacted quite cold, just told me why I didn't do that during the last 3 months and didn't act vulnerable. How different I actuallyy was of the guy she knew for 2 years who was really chill-down and didn't give a fuck. She has to process this. I left the book with her and told her my feelings have allways been there, I'm just having difficulties expressing it. And the book tells everything. She told me she would read after her exams.

\- The days after we texted on work, just normal chit-chat. She was busy, I was busy. I was wondering what she would do. I asked her if she wanted anything special for Friday. She said she didn't need anything and she would call me after studies. I expected her to break-up, she didn't. She told me that she doesn't feel well and good enough to come at me and sleep, that she can't act as if nothing happened. I understood. I told her there are 3 options, break-up, give a break or come together and talk. She said that a break-up at this point was too harsh, she needed time to recover and think. It was a good conversation, we joked here and there and it was ok. We understood each other. We also talked about the circumstances which are not ideal. We agreed. I told her I would not bother her. I asked her if we can chat and she said just random chit-chat here and there is fine. I didn't chat her and wanted to leave her.

\- On Monday she was also at office. This is actually this Monday. She acted weird. She saw me twice and went back. She didn't say even hi. I was devastated. We can have problems but acting like this is very very bad. In the morning I was getting coffee, she came out of her room, I saw her through the mirror. She saw me and head back immediately. I felt really bad. Later on I was in a meeting with others, she walked by and waved at me, I smiled back. Later on I was in a meeting room on my own. She came to the pantry to grab some fruits. I saw she saw me, hesitated to come to me and went back. I felt strange. I chatted her for the first time that day and told her I thought she hesitated, I was in a meeting and she could come in. She said she didn't see me and just grabbed fruit. Weird, there is a distance of 2 meters. Later on she walked by our room with her team and didn't even look at me. We also have mutual friends in my team, she didn't even come into our room to say hi. Even my colleagues did think it was really weird. I felt really bad. I was pissed and decided to ask for an explanation. Went to her room and asked if we could talk. We talked, I told her the situation was awkward. She agreed but didn't give an explanation. I asked her what she meant with needing time cause I didn't want to wait for months in such a situation. She just wanted my deadline to finish (which is this week) and her deadline (she finishes Thursday) and then she wanted to think during the weekend which is also her birthday. I said that's fine. Told her I care about her and her well being and even if we break up I think about her health. She said it's just all too much and started crying, I consoled her. I said sorry for this as this was not my intention, she said she was doing fine untill she saw me and her day is bad again. We then split up. I discussed with my colleagues, one of them saw me also hugging her. They also said she didn't need to act like that childish in amy circumstance and she should just come and say at least hi. I agreed.  We can have conflicts and she can feel bad, but I never yelled at her, never insulted her, never threatened her. This is how you behave towards someone you hate. I sent her first a message, then deleted and a voice message in the night saying how bad her behaviour is, all the frustrations I spoke out. She didn't see as she was sleeping. I regretted and deleted the messages. She asked in the morning what I deleted. I explained I felt bad yesterday and reacted, but then I regret as it is not necessary to act now out of emotions and that we should calm down and talk. She didn't read. I didn't send her a message on our work chat, she also didn't. Maybe she is angry, maybe she if focussing on her assignment. She is weird with social media anyway. During busy days she only reads her whatsapp in the morning and when going to bad, during workdays even puts herself sometimes out of office even to concentrate. Maybe an ADHD thing, don't know. We didn't have any contact since Monday.

I' m mentally down. Just sick of her behaviour. Monday felt like a border was crossed. Having a rational conversation on Friday like adults and seeing this childish behaviour on Monday is weird. I just don't know it anymore. I don't know what to feel, what to think, how to fix if she doesn't fucking communicate. I don't know anymore. One part of me says break-up and get out of it. Another part of me says, it all comes down to communication, lack of time and external pressures and stress which made both of us act like this. Our communication during our 2 days friendship was perfect and our feelings in October were pure. I really don't know what to think, what she will do, how I should react, I don't know.

Have I been overracting and what is the best to do?

I think he is a pretty good person, but he is an absolute man-child when it comes to household chores. He doesn‚Äôt do anything, even though both have worked full-time. I know that they broke up for a few weeks in the past over this, but they got back together and my fianc√© and I just assumed that he had bettered himself. My fianc√© (27M) and I (26F) live in a different country, so we did not have that much insight. We recently visited my fianc√©‚Äôs family and were horrified about what we learned:

My SIL and her husband usually stay with my parents in law over the weekend. 
My parents in law were very tired and a little hostile/annoyed towards her husband. In a calm minute, I asked my MIL what‚Äôs wrong and she poured out her heart: she is just fed up with my SIL‚Äôs husband. My MiL working 50+ hours a week, helping my SIL with the baby, does all household chores (my fianc√© and I helped a lot of course during visiting). She is just asking him to keep his things clean, but he can‚Äôt even do that. He is leaving the guest room with 10+ empty bottles, he is using 3 towels a day (no exaggeration) - so they always run out of towels when they are there, uses up the warm water when he showers, throws the pillows off the couch everytime he wants to lie down on it, he leaves his things everywhere across the house, leaves dirty dishes on the sink without ever cleaning or loading/emptying the dishwasher, (sometimes even just takes my fianc√©‚Äôs clothes and claims they are his),‚Ä¶ he just sits in the bed or on the sofa all weekend - now but also before the baby came. And it got worse and worse. All conversations with him didn‚Äôt help at all, my SIL is regularly fighting with him about it but nothing changes. 

The week the baby came, my SIL lived with her parents, her husband was alone at home for that week and left the flag in absolute chaos - I am talking dishes with unfinished food in every room, days-old coffee etc.

I really want to help my SIL and MIL, the whole family is stressed about this and suffering. I just find his behaviour very disrespectful, it also affects  my fianc√© and me because we have to do more house chores as a consequence of his mess and because we don‚Äôt have towels or hot water after he showered.

Do you have any advice on this situation?

My MIL says she can‚Äôt really tell him not to come because she wants to see her daughter and grandchild. I said she can‚Äôt only invite the two and say the husband is not allowed to come unless he learns to clean up after himself. My MiL says she can‚Äôt do that. I suggested that my SIL talks to him, but apparently this always ends up in a fight without any changes afterwards. 
Also, the two are renting a flat that‚Äôs owned by my fianc√© and me. I thought about telling them that if the flat is not kept clean, we would have to   end the lease, so for once in his life, he would feel the consequences to his behaviour. But I would never follow through and throw my SIL and the baby out. Also, I think he wouldn‚Äôt change and my SIL would probably be the one cleaning everything again. 
So do you have any advice?

Its been a quiet couple of nights, but as FDAs we all know that doesnt last long. The night went by without incident, even took a nap so I could be fully awake by morning. I was filling up the breakfast area, which is the one of the side tasks I do by 4am. I put the ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be right back‚Äù sign up, because I‚Äôm in the kitchen away from the desk. Then I hear it. The dreaded ‚ÄúHELLLOOOOO?!‚Äù coming from the front desk. I walk back to greet the person (with a smile on my face mind you. Its 4am. I‚Äôm usually not a happy person by then, but like I said, I got a nap in.) 

This bitch: Are you working front desk?

Me: Yes, goodmorning! Sorry, how can I help you?

Guest: Why are you in the kitchen if youre front desk? Ive been standing here for 10 minutes.

Like damn, I said fucking good morning. And no you havent bitch, the coffee takes 5 mins to brew which just finished as I walked back into the kitchen. You werent there when I walked in, you were here when I heard you yell like a banshee. So 2-3 mins tops. Still, my apologies for not being glued to the front desk.

So she goes on after I just decided not to respond to her cause if I did, it wouldnt have been nice. More like ‚Äúdidnt know you were my manager, or my man asking me why I‚Äôm doing this and that.‚Äù

Guest wanted to know why she was ‚Äúcharged‚Äù $600. So I tap into her folio and see that she has 8 nights on a long stay rate. Cool. Its just simply explaining that it was an authorization hold. Right?

Wrong.

Guest: No you dont get it, that was all of my money!

Me: I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that ma‚Äôam, the only thing I can do is let my manager know and she will be better prepared to assist you with that and answer further questions. From my end, I‚Äôm seeing it as an authorization for 8 nights.

Guest: No, I was told there was only going to be a hold of $20 a night! Not $600! What am I supposed to do because this feels like fraud and I‚Äôm about to call the cops!

Like I said in previous posts, how you come to me matters. I‚Äôm not a manager, so I‚Äôm not going to kiss ass and give money out or points. I personally dont do anything with refunds, only because I dont want to hear it in the morning. So I gave her my managers‚Äô names and told her to speak with them.

I know I can release auth holds but I am not a manager. And I dont want to deal with the whys and why nots.

I‚Äôm 44F who loves reading, cooking, music, movies, gaming, knitting, and photography. On my weekends I usually spend time getting lost in a good book, trying new recipes, or snapping photos of whatever catches my eye when I‚Äôm out enjoying a coffee with friends.  

Music is a big part of my life, and I love seeking out a new playlist or relaxing with a chill movie night. I‚Äôm also a bit of a gamer, so if you‚Äôre into that too, we could have a fun gaming night.  

I‚Äôm looking for someone who is single, emotionally available, takes care of themselves, and enjoys staying fit and healthy. I‚Äôm not into smoking or drinking, and I‚Äôd love to find someone who feels the same. I‚Äôm also looking for someone who is Caucasian, professional, and has their own interests.  

I know that everybody has a past, but Im not looking to connect with anyone who is separated or going throw a divorce. I‚Äôm seeking someone who is truly single and ready for a genuine connection.
In terms of age range, I‚Äôd best be suited to someone between the ages of 35 to 45.  

If you think we‚Äôd get along, send me a message and tell me a little about yourself! I‚Äôd love to know what book you‚Äôre currently reading and what you're passionate about.",1,1742986097.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1jk8voy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/1jk8voy/asrock_deskmini_or_inwin_chopin/,ASRock Deskmini or InWin Chopin?,"I'm thinking of a pc that has it's consumption at a minimum that I can just leave on for days and I could use for basic tasks like browsing the net or maybe play some quick run of Balatro or FTL with occasionally.

My current pc that features a regular cpu and a dedicated gpu seems overkill for this usecase, but I rarely do more on weekdays. Having a system on for longer periods makes less sense if it also operates a dedicated gpu more suited for actual 3D-accelerated gaming. Yet since I already have a spare 12400T cpu with it's integrated UHD 730 gpu and with it's total 35w TDP, it seems perfect for something of a terminal-like workstation that I can even leave on at night in the living room, then return to sit down to it in the morning while I drink my coffee to do some mundane tasks that does not require the performance of a dedicated gpu. For this, I narrowed it down to these cases.

The Deskmini would be a bit cheaper as while it's more expensive than the Chopin, it has it's own motherboard. Yet the memory would likely be a CL20 unit due to SODIMM. I'm not a fan of the psu being outside, however it's fanless. Which sounds nice - especially for a system that might be on for extended periods of time, the less moving parts the better right? I don't know if the case is made from metal or plastic though. If someone could answer that, I would appreciate it.

As for the Chopin, while it's about 50% bigger, it seems more durable and is brickless - making it more suitable for travel overall, especially since it's built like a tank with it's thick metal cover. It also have it's own psu, yet it is with a moving part that could be audible. If anyone could tell me their first hand experience of the sound of the psu of the 200w Gold unit featured with the Chopin Max, I would be grateful as that could be a major deciding factor. Since the build only features a 35w cpu, I'm sure it won't be stressed too much.

1jk8rcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jk8rcl/jords_troubled_life_chapter_eight/,Jord's troubled life | Chapter Eight,"The day erupted with mechanical protests, Elia‚Äôs voice cutting through the morning peace like a hacksaw. *The fucking boiler,* Jord thought darkly, his knuckles whitening around the banister. *I‚Äôll reduce it to scrap before sprint‚Äôs end.*

‚ÄòI‚Äôm coming!‚Äô He descended into the cellar‚Äôs damp throat, hands moving with the cursed familiarity of a man tending an abusive lover. The panel groaned open; a twist, a thump, and the beast fell silent. Elia‚Äôs ‚ÄòThanks!‚Äô ricocheted off cobwebbed walls, sharp with relief.

Grumpiness clung to Jord like a second skin as he shuffled kitchen-ward. Light bloomed at his touch, revealing Irena‚Äôs abandoned dough rising like a phantom under cloth. The coffee ritual began ‚Äì a daily libation to Toyan the Splendid, that mythic butcher-explorer whose colonial appetites had gifted Meridia this bitter sacrament. Jord raised his chipped mug in mock salute. *To conquest and caffeine*, he thought, swallowing tar-thick brew that tasted of ash and wakefulness. Addiction was too pretty a word ‚Äì this was survival, plain as the tremor in his arm.

Once dressed, he considered stopping by the old man‚Äôs mini-market, but the realisation hit ‚Äì he *still* hadn‚Äôt asked when he‚Äôd be paid. That killed that plan quickly. He sighed, shoved his hands into his pockets, and carried on.

On his way, a couple of urchins lingered near the curb, eyes flitting between passers-by.

‚ÄòSir‚Ä¶ sir, got some spare?‚Äô One of them, a little boy, held out a cap that held few marks.

Jord hesitated ‚Äì his own pockets weren‚Äôt exactly deep. But he always kept a little set aside for moments like this. He remembered what it was like growing up, seeing friends fall through the cracks, some never climbing back out. Being in the red was one thing. Having *nothing* was another.

‚ÄòHere.‚Äô He dropped a couple of marks into the boy‚Äôs cap and ruffled his hair before moving on.

Above, the stars lingered ‚Äì Stars winking through daylight‚Äôs veil. Jord blinked, but the anomaly slipped his mind like water through a rusted sieve.

At the gate, the usual procedures ‚Äì checkpoint, clearance, nods exchanged ‚Äì and then onto Track Three. Lapo was already there. Jord checked the time. Breaking even. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre timely,‚Äô he remarked, as though punctuality were a mild vice.

Then he started pacing along the track.

‚ÄòSir ‚Äì why just the two of us?‚Äô Jord matched his stride.

‚ÄòI personally requested special training dispensation from the Ministry. We‚Äôve got the month to ourselves. Need to polish you up before the delegation forms opinions about our department capability.‚Äô

‚ÄòAm I to be presented as a guard unit?‚Äô Jord pressed, seeking clarity.

‚ÄòTo them, you‚Äôll be presented as one example of a mobilisation force. In the role of a pacificator, or know as military police. And if you wondered such activities will be compensated.‚Äô Lapo‚Äôs pace quickened as he spoke.

‚ÄòAbout the pay...‚Äô Jord ventured, ‚Äòwhen might I expect it? Nothing urgent, just planning ahead.‚Äô

Lapo‚Äôs raised eyebrow carried a tone. ‚ÄòI can arrange something, Monday‚Äôs the earliest. Bureaucracy moves at its own pace, powered by prayers and paperwork.‚Äô

The day dissolved into sweat-slicked sacrament. Sabre drills became hims; target practice, a litany. By dusk, Jord‚Äôs body screamed its heresies ‚Äì muscles apostate, lungs burning like censers.

‚ÄòAdequate,‚Äô Lapo pronounced, departing without ceremony.

Homeward, Jord reeled ‚Äì a drunkard journey. Above, the false stars multiplied, their light now a viscous glow that pooled in the cobblestone cracks. The brightest one swelled, a tumour on the sky‚Äôs pale cheek. He paused, nausea rising ‚Äì not from exhaustion, but the *wrongness* of their arrangement, angles too acute, rhythms discordant. *Like teeth*, he thought wildly. *Teeth in a jaw too wide to ‚Äì*

The epiphany shattered as metal screamed against brick. Jord wheeled toward the sound ‚Äì a car kissed the a building‚Äôs wall. The stars dimmed.

He approached in careful increments, gravel crunching like ancient vertebrae beneath his boots. The driver ‚Äì an elderly woman ‚Äì slumped against her seatbelt, unharmed save for the look of wildness in her eyes. No blood. No broken glass. Only the reek of scorched rubber and something sharper, metallic, that clung to the back of Jord‚Äôs throat.

‚ÄòMadam?‚Äô He eased the door open, hands raised in placation. Her gaze fixed not on him, but on the sky, pupils dilated to swallow the iris whole.

‚Äò‚Ä¶the angles,‚Äô she rasped, spittle glistening on chapped lips. ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt you *see*? The angles are all wrong ‚Äì‚Äô Her fingers clawed at the wind-shield, nails scraping against glass. ‚Äò‚Äì teeth in the dark, teeth in the *dark* ‚Äì‚Äô

Jord stepped back, the woman‚Äôs hysteria lapping at his resolve. He fumbled for his phone, the emergency operator‚Äôs voice tinny through the receiver. ‚ÄòLow-speed collision. Elderly driver. Delirious‚Ä¶ No, no visible injuries.‚Äô

He waited, spine pressed to damp brickwork, as sirens wailed closer. The stars throbbed anew ‚Äì *wrong*, so wrong ‚Äì their light leaching colour from the wreck. The woman‚Äôs ravings crescendoed: ‚Äò*They‚Äôre coming through the cracks ‚Äì !*‚Äô

Paramedics shouldered past, their uniforms blinding white against the gloom. Jord melted into the crowd, the woman‚Äôs cries chasing him down the alley. ‚Äò*You‚Äôll see! You‚Äôll all see when the sky splits ‚Äì !*‚Äô

He walked faster. Above, stars pulsed.

The woman‚Äôs screams followed Jord home. They coiled in his ears long after the paramedics‚Äô vans had vanished, slithering through his thoughts as he navigated Thamburg‚Äôs labyrinthine alleys. Above, the false stars swelled ‚Äì a cluster of festering lights that *twisted* if stared at too long, their edges warping like smoke over flame.

He walked faster. Almost bolting, exhausting be damned.

The Boltworks loomed, it‚Äôs balconies elongated like fangs. Jord‚Äôs second shower scalded him raw, but the water couldn‚Äôt sluice away the old woman‚Äôs words. *Teeth in the dark*. He scrubbed until his skin blushed angry pink, her rasp echoing in the steam. *You‚Äôll see when the sky splits*.

Downstairs, Feliko‚Äôs newspaper rustled like dry insect wings. Irena hummed a folk tune out of key. Elia glanced up from his tinkering ‚Äì gears and springs spread like entrails across the table ‚Äì and froze.

‚ÄòYou look like you‚Äôve seen a wraith,‚Äô Elia said.

Jord forced a laugh, brittle. ‚ÄòJust a‚Ä¶ senile driver.‚Äô

Elia‚Äôs gaze lingered, sharp. ‚ÄòSenile drivers don‚Äôt leave you grey.‚Äô

Supper passed in leaden silence. Jord pushed boiled meat around his plate, the woman‚Äôs face superimposing itself over his mother‚Äôs. *The angles are wrong*, she‚Äôd hissed. Now the kitchen‚Äôs geometry felt suspect ‚Äì walls leaning at impossible gradients, the ceiling‚Äôs cracks mapping constellations he dared not name.

Sleep, when it came, was a fevered thing.

**‚Äì the car‚Äôs yellow paint bleeds upward, becoming the ‚Äì‚Äì the woman‚Äôs fingers elongate, claws scraping glass that ‚Äì‚Äì sky rips** ***like fabric*****, revealing infinite ‚Äì**

Jord woke gagging, sweat pooling in the hollows of his collarbone. Dawn‚Äôs first light seeped through the window, tinged greenish at the edges.

**The walls** *breathed***. Jord reeled down the hallway, shoulder slamming in the walls in a staccato rhythm. His fingertips burned with freezer-ache cold, yet his arms left smears of phantom fire in the air ‚Äì contradictions that liquefied reason. A framed landscape crashed to the floor, glass shards blooming like frozen lightning.** *Why does the floor tilt? Why does the air taste of ‚Äì*

Irena appeared, fury first ‚Äì lips parted for reproach ‚Äì then horror. Her palm met his forehead, her expression grave. ‚ÄòGods *burn*, you‚Äôre a furnace!‚Äô Her voice frayed at the edges. ‚ÄòSit. *Now*.‚Äô

He stumbled after her, knees buckling in time with the floor‚Äôs unnatural undulations. The kitchen tiles leached what little warmth remained in his bones. Then, with help, he was made to sit on a chair.

‚ÄòDrink.‚Äô She thrust a glass into his trembling hands. Water slopped over the rim, droplets seemed to hiss as they hit his scorching skin. Pills followed ‚Äì chalky bitterness that stung his throat like an angry bee. The world stabilized, briefly, into something resembling coherence.

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre in no state to ‚Äì ‚Äô

‚ÄòI *have* to.‚Äô Jord‚Äôs voice emerged raw.

Irena‚Äôs face contorted ‚Äì a mother‚Äôs fear warring with decades of Meridian stoicism. ‚ÄòWhatever devil‚Äôs got its hooks in you, boy, it‚Äôll chew through your marrow before noon.‚Äô

Jord stood, the chair screeching backward. His reflection in the window warped ‚Äì a fun-house mockery, limbs elongated, eyes smudged pits. *Just the fever*, he told himself. *Just the ‚Äì*

A sound cut through the lie. Not a sound ‚Äì a *vibration*, felt in the molars. The same frequency as the woman‚Äôs ravings. The same pitch as the stars‚Äô silent scream.

**The world dissolved in a cascade of static ‚Äì not darkness, but a sickly prismatic smear, as if the air itself had turned to oil. Jord‚Äôs knees buckled. The floor rushed up, cold and unyielding as a mortuary slab. His temple struck tile with a wet** *crack***, pain blooming fractal-bright behind his eyes.**

Irena‚Äôs scream pierced the haze, warped and distant ‚Äì a voice wadding through mud. *Mum*, he tried to say, but his tongue lay leaden, metallic blood pooling beneath his cheek. Shadows writhed at the edges of his vision, not shadows but *teeth*, endless rows of them, gnashing in a rhythm that matched the throbbing in his skull.

He felt false stars pressed down, their light syrupy and invasive. Jord‚Äôs breath hitched, lungs fluttering like trapped moths. He tasted copper and something older, fouler ‚Äì a primordial rot that seeped from the cracks between time.

Irena‚Äôs hands gripped his shoulders, her voice splintering into fragments: *‚Äò‚Äì ambulance ‚Äì‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äì Gods, stay with me ‚Äì‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äì Elia! the phone, now ‚Äì‚Äô*

Jord‚Äôs fingers twitched, carving feeble arcs in the spilled water. The vibrations returned ‚Äì deeper now, resonating in the marrow of his teeth. *They‚Äôre here*, he thought, or perhaps the stars whispered it through him. The ceiling peeled back, revealing a maw of pulsating light, its edges serrated and *hungry*.

Consciousness frayed, a thread snipped by cosmic shears. The last thing he heard was not his mother‚Äôs cries, but the sound of the universe ***laughing*** ‚Äì a wet, *gurgling* chorus that defied all geometry.

Time performed a peculiar sleight of hand ‚Äì one moment Jord lay crumpled on the kitchen floor, the next he found himself in a hospital room that had seen better days. Cracked windows told tales of deferred maintenance, missing panels spoke of limited resources, and a lone wooden chair stood sentinel for visitors.

His eyes traced the room's boundaries, finding himself alone behind a closed door with its glass panel. No call button presented itself, leaving him to wait anxiously, watching shadows beyond glass moving, until finally, a white-clad figure appeared.

‚ÄòAh, you‚Äôre finally awake, just a moment‚Äô. The man ‚Äì sporting a neat brown crop of hair ‚Äì consulted his notes until he found what he sought. ‚ÄòCan you tell me your name, sir?‚Äô

‚ÄòJord... Jord Whittaker.‚Äô

‚ÄòGood, very good. And the date?‚Äô

‚ÄòFriday?‚Äô

‚ÄòA bit more precise, month and year, if you can.‚Äô

‚ÄòMay of the one-hundred-thirty-seventh?‚Äô ‚ÄòGood. Now, if you wish, I can call your family.‚Äô ‚ÄòYes, please.‚Äô

The doctor returned with Elia, who practically flew to Jord‚Äôs bedside. ‚ÄòOh, thank Gods!‚Äô

‚ÄòSomewhat, it‚Äôs just... strange?‚Äô Jord ventured, frowned. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fine, truly. I think more than fine? But... what happened?‚Äô

‚ÄòYou were strange, delirious, then you collapsed. You were rambling, something about yellow, stars, and teeth.‚Äô

The words sent ice through Jord‚Äôs veins, as if he‚Äôd been plunged into frozen waters. ‚ÄòPlease, please. Don't say those things any-more.‚Äô His eyes went wild, arms wrapping around himself protectively.

The doctor drew Elia aside, exchanging words beyond Jord's hearing. After a brief conference, Elia returned to his bedside.

Jord steadied himself with a deep breath. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fine, truly. When can I go, good sir?‚Äô

‚ÄòA day at most, don‚Äôt worry, just routine to confirm you won‚Äôt slip back.‚Äô

The night passed peacefully ‚Äì no nightmares, no convulsions ‚Äì leading to his discharge with a curious warning about avoiding intermittent lights, and that if he felt anything amiss he should call for help. Jord thanked the staff and left.

Back home, Elia prepared tea and biscuits in the kitchen, the siblings settling into chairs side by side.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry, Jord. I‚Ä¶ know it was hard for you to join the guards‚Ä¶ and after all what happened. But‚Ä¶ I-I didn‚Äôt think it would be so hard!‚Äô Tears traced paths down Elia‚Äôs freckled face.

Jord squeezed his younger brother‚Äôs shoulder gently. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs just the‚Ä¶ exhaustion,‚Äô he offered softly, carefully avoiding memories of recent events. ‚ÄòI‚Ä¶ thought I could shoulder past it all, and... well, I couldn‚Äôt. Seems I'm but a man.‚Äô

They shared tea and biscuits in comfortable silence until Jord ventured softer talking points, ‚ÄòSo, what goes‚Ä¶ did you try to hit on that girl, Irena was it?‚Äô Elia's cheeks flushed immediately.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs complicated,‚Äô Elia mumbled, studying the table intently.

‚ÄòOh?‚Äô Jord's tone lifted teasingly. ‚ÄòNot yet? How come? Seemed your type: Passionate, outspoken, *intelligent*... And that thing with the pamphlets? The‚Ä¶ ‚Äô he scrunched his face in theatrical remembrance, ‚ÄòShe asked to give *you* something about‚Ä¶ *erosion?,*' he finished with conspiratorial emphasis.

Jord then took a slow sip of tea, the picture of exaggerated innocence. He let the moment stretch before casually remarking, ‚ÄòSo‚Ä¶ did she finally let you catalogue her rock collection? Or are you still lingering at the *sedimentary small talk* stage?‚Äô

Across from him, Elia flushed to the tips of his ears. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not ‚Äì we‚Äôre *collaborating*. Professionally.‚Äô

Jord grinned, setting his cup down with a deliberate clink. ‚ÄòAh yes, the ol‚Äô ‚Äúprofessional collaboration‚Äù ruse. Worked wonders for Mum and Dad, didn‚Äôt it? *Feliko, could you please pass the tectonic wren ‚Äì* ‚Äô

A biscuit flew across the table, bouncing harmlessly off Jord‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄòShut up!‚Äô Elia groaned. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs running a geology outreach stall. Needed help with‚Ä¶ diagrams.‚Äô

Jord dodged another biscuit, laughing. ‚ÄòDiagrams! Of course! Nothing says romance like cross-sectional stratigraphy. *Darling, let me show you my bedrock ‚Äì*‚Äô

Elia buried his face in his hands. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre vile. I regret every childhood secret I ever entrusted to you.‚Äô

Jord softened, nudging him. ‚ÄòCome on. She‚Äôs clever. She‚Äôs got that‚Ä¶ intensity. Like when you used to take apart radios to ‚Äúsee where the voices lived.‚Äù You‚Äôre both mad in the same way.‚Äô

Elia peeked at him through his fingers, reluctant but unable to hide the small, satisfied smile creeping onto his face. ‚Äò‚Ä¶She did lend me her annotated copy of *Subterranean Meridia*. Margin notes in three colours.‚Äô

Jord mock-gasped. ‚Äò*Three* colours?! Proposal‚Äôs overdue, then. Do you need a wingman? I‚Äôll wear my dress uniform, say you‚Äôre a *heroic civic engineer*.‚Äô

Elia snorted. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôd combust within minutes. Last time you ‚Äúhelped,‚Äù you told Valkan‚Äôs sister I bred exotic snails.‚Äô

Jord grinned, wholly unrepentant. ‚ÄòAnd she bought it! You‚Äôve got that‚Ä¶ molluscan charm.‚Äô

Elia shoved him, laughing. ‚ÄòPiss off.‚Äô

Jord chuckled but then fell quiet, his gaze drifting toward the window. Beyond the glass, the city lights flickered, stars pulsing faintly in the distance. When he spoke again, his voice was softer. ‚Äò‚Ä¶She‚Äôs good for you. Better than‚Ä¶ all this.‚Äô He gestured vaguely, as if trying to encompass the weight of everything left unsaid.

Elia followed his gaze, uneasy. ‚ÄòJord ‚Äì ‚Äô

‚ÄòPass the biscuits,‚Äô Jord interrupted briskly. ‚ÄòIf I‚Äôm stuck here convalescing, I‚Äôm eating all the sweets.‚Äô

Through the aftershocks of his collapse, Jord‚Äôs thoughts turned to something far more mundane ‚Äì the promised payslip. A glance at his phone revealed it was already Tuesday, a day past the scheduled payday. Missed calls from both Lapo and Mara cluttered his log, though their measured persistence suggested his hospitalisation had been duly noted.

The matter of payment logistics nagged at him. In his previous role, Altrasto ‚Äì that cheerfully tippling paymaster ‚Äì had managed things with clockwork precision. *What was it he always said? ‚ÄúDay of pay, day of happiness‚Äù?* The memory of Altrasto‚Äôs fondness for drink brought a slight smile to Jord‚Äôs lips; who was he to judge another‚Äôs love affair?

Shaking off the reminiscence, Jord dialled Mara‚Äôs office number.

‚ÄòHello, is this Whittaker? Are you alright?‚Äô

‚ÄòYes. I‚Äôm fine and well... more or less. I called to inquire about the provisional pay Lapo arranged ‚Äì and the bonus for the operation.‚Äô

‚ÄòDidn't I tell you?‚Äô Mara‚Äôs words sent his heart leaping into his throat.

‚ÄòNo? Is there a problem regarding my absence?‚Äô His voice wavered ever so slightly.

‚ÄòNo, no ‚Äì we checked with your doctor and that‚Äôs already resolved. Your pay-slip is loaded onto your smart-card. You can withdraw it at any bank connected with the Ministry ‚Äì practically all of them. Anything else?‚Äô

‚ÄòYes, is it alright if I come back tomorrow?‚Äô Jord ventured, earning a sharp look from Elia.

‚ÄòSo soon? Isn‚Äôt that a bit... excessive?‚Äô Surprise tinged Mara‚Äôs tone.

*I need the money,* Jord thought. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just how I am ‚Äì I prefer to be doing something. I can‚Äôt, in good conscience, be seen as missing too much work.‚Äô

‚ÄòWell, if you say so. My personal recommendation would be for you to rest. But you know better; your doctor cleared you. So, be my guest. If you wish, I‚Äôll inform Polazit.‚Äô

‚ÄòYes, thanks. Have a good day.‚Äô

‚ÄòGood day. And do try to rest, though.‚Äô

As the call ended, Elia‚Äôs concern bubbled over immediately. ‚ÄòYou sure? Isn‚Äôt that a bit... too soon?‚Äô

‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äô Jord replied, though inwardly he mused, *and I need to ask Lapo what the hell is happening to me.*

The remainder of the day unfolded in gentler rhythms ‚Äì quiet reading, light-hearted banter with Elia, who‚Äôd taken the day off, and a joint, albeit futile, attempt to coax the temperamental boiler back to life. Their combined technical knowledge proved insufficient, and a coin flip between self-education and professional help determined their course. Fate chose education, sending Elia out with Jord‚Äôs smart-card to procure technical manuals that soon had both brothers squinting at diagrams and debating interpretations.

I‚Äôve had a lot of years doing this!  My record is against me yet I still keep holding out for the time when I can be a reasonable caffeine user.

1jk8noa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jk8noa,The rollercoaster ride that brought me my soul dog,"When I was 18, I lost my dad. The very next day, as I was walking down the street, I saw a homeless man selling puppies from a cardboard box. My heart broke. I knew those puppies could end up anywhere. I was lost, heartbroken, and when my eyes met this puppy‚Äôs eyes instantly took the most impulsive and crazy decision of my life. 

I didn‚Äôt know what I was getting into. I had never had a dog like him‚Äîbig and full of energy, like someone had injected him with three cups of coffee every morning. I was living in a tiny apartment with four roommates, struggling with money, and yet, I spent it all on him. I didn‚Äôt care. He destroyed my furniture, he got into trouble (many emergency vet visits), and at one point, I thought he was trying to get me evicted. But no matter what, he was always by my side.

In the five years since then, he‚Äôs been the constant in my life through every change and challenge. He‚Äôs my son, my best friend, the reason I wake up every day, and the reason I work so hard‚Äîto give him a better life and one day, a house with a yard. (Or at least, a place where he won‚Äôt need to eat the couch for fun.)

It hasn‚Äôt been easy, but looking back, I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I just would like to say: if you‚Äôre thinking about adopting or buying a dog like him, just make sure you‚Äôre ready for the ride. It shouldn‚Äôt be an impulsive decision like mine, it‚Äôs a lot of responsibility so think and plan ahead. And be ready to change your furniture üòâ",18,1742985139.0,AmStaffPitts,4,1.0,False

1jk8mvq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jk8mvq,"Did you miss the $kendu godcandle? It‚Äôs still going, now, so ape while you can","Kendu Inu is not just holding its ground in the market. It is taking over. In one week, it has jumped from a $7 million to an $18 million market cap, even after a major whale unloaded heavy sell pressure. Most tokens would have collapsed under that weight. Kendu kept moving forward. That kind of momentum comes from more than just speculation. It comes from a brand that is making its mark in the real world and attracting new audiences who are stepping into crypto without even realizing it.

This is not just about price action. It is about building something bigger. Kendu is expanding into board games, energy drinks, coffee, and video games. These are not side projects. They are real products that put the brand in front of people on a daily basis. Every time someone plays a game, grabs an energy drink, or picks up a bag of Kendu coffee, they are interacting with the brand whether they own the token or not. That is how real adoption happens.

The nightclub events in India and Miami are another major step. These are not just parties. They are immersive experiences designed to pull people into the Kendu ecosystem. When people are surrounded by the brand, drinking Kendu cocktails, and sharing the experience online, it creates an organic marketing wave that money cannot buy. It is about making Kendu something people want to be part of in every aspect of their lives.

The biggest driving force behind all of this is the online community. Kendu‚Äôs following is not just engaged. It is relentless. This is a group that floods social media, pushes back against negativity before it can take hold, and makes sure Kendu stays in the conversation. A brand with that level of loyalty does not fade away. It only gets stronger.

Kendu is not waiting for mainstream crypto adoption. It is creating it. That is why it powered through the sell pressure, why its market cap keeps rising, and why this is still just the beginning. The numbers today are only a small glimpse of what is coming next.
