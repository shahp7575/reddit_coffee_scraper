1qneqoa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qneqoa,How Would You Design a Floating Coffee Station Here?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve completely run out of space in my kitchen for appliances, so I’m thinking of creating a floating coffee station on this wall (it needs to be floating because of the heater underneath).

The idea is to use it for my coffee machine, toaster, and kettle, with floating shelves or cupboards. The problem is… I have zero interior design skills 😅

I’d really appreciate any ideas on:
	•	How best to utilise this wall space
	•	Layout suggestions for the floating counter + shelves/cabinets
	•	How to make it look cohesive with the rest of the kitchen

In terms of dimensions: 

Depth: 34cm
Full width: 106cm
Height: 230cm

I’ve uploaded a full photo of the kitchen for context. Any advice, inspiration, or examples would be amazing - thank you!

1qnepcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qnepcz/how_to_handle_money_like_happy_couples_do_the/,How to Handle MONEY Like Happy Couples Do: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Money fights are the number one reason couples break up. Not cheating, not different life goals, MONEY. I've spent months deep-diving into research from financial therapists, relationship experts, and couples who've actually figured this shit out (books like ""The Psychology of Money"" by Morgan Housel, podcasts like ""Afford Anything"" with Paula Pant, and studies from the Gottman Institute). The pattern is crystal clear: happy couples don't avoid money talks, they just handle them completely differently than everyone else.

Here's what actually works when two people try to merge their financial lives without losing their minds.

**Step 1: Have the Ugly Money Talk Early (like, really early)**

You need to know each other's money baggage before you're knee-deep in shared bills. What's their credit score? How much debt are they carrying? What does their family think about money? Are they a saver or a spender?

This isn't romantic, but you know what else isn't romantic? Finding out your partner has $50k in credit card debt after you've already moved in together.

Most couples wait until there's a crisis to talk about money. That's like waiting until your car is on fire to check if you have insurance. Bad move.

Financial therapist Amanda Clayman says money conversations reveal your core values faster than almost anything else. If someone thinks spending $200 on concert tickets is essential and you think it's insane, that's not about money. That's about what you value in life.

**Step 2: Pick Your Money System (and stop judging each other's choices)**

There's no ""right"" way to handle money as a couple, but you need to pick ONE system and stick with it. Here are the main ones that actually work:

**Joint everything**: All money goes into one pot. You're a team, everything is ""ours."" This works for couples who have similar spending habits and trust each other completely.

**Separate everything**: Keep your own accounts, split bills 50/50 or proportionally. This works for people who value independence or came into the relationship with very different financial situations.

**The hybrid (most popular)**: Joint account for shared expenses (rent, groceries, utilities), separate accounts for personal spending. You each contribute a set amount to the joint account every month. This is what most happy couples actually do because it gives you both autonomy AND teamwork.

The couples who fight the most about money are the ones who never actually agreed on a system. They're just winging it and getting mad when their partner doesn't read their mind.

**Step 3: Decide What ""Fair"" Actually Means**

Here's where shit gets real. If one person makes $100k and the other makes $40k, is splitting expenses 50/50 actually fair? Probably not.

Happy couples figure out their own definition of fair, and it's usually proportional to income. If you make 70% of the household income, you contribute 70% to shared expenses. The other person contributes 30%. This way, you both have roughly the same amount of ""fun money"" left over.

The book ""Cents and Sensibility"" by Gary Belsky breaks this down beautifully. Fair doesn't mean equal. Fair means you both feel like you're contributing appropriately and neither person is stressed about money while the other is living large.

**Step 4: Create a ""No Questions Asked"" Fund for Each Person**

This is the game changer. Each person gets a monthly amount of money they can spend on WHATEVER THEY WANT without explaining or justifying it to their partner.

Want to buy another pair of sneakers? Go for it. Want to spend $80 on a fancy dinner with friends? None of my business. This eliminates like 80% of money fights because you're not micromanaging each other's spending.

The amount depends on your income, but even if it's just $100 a month, that freedom matters. You're adults. You shouldn't have to ask permission to buy a coffee.

Paula Pant from the ""Afford Anything"" podcast calls this ""building autonomy into your financial plan."" Couples who don't do this end up resenting each other because everything feels like a negotiation.

**Step 5: Set Shared Goals (or you'll pull in opposite directions)**

If one person is saving for a house and the other is planning a $5k vacation to Europe, you're going to have problems. Happy couples sit down and figure out what they're working toward TOGETHER.

Make a list:
* Short term goals (next 1-2 years): Pay off credit cards, build an emergency fund, take a trip
* Medium term goals (3-5 years): Save for a wedding, buy a house, start a business  
* Long term goals (10+ years): Retirement, kids' college funds, financial independence

Once you know what you're working toward together, spending decisions get easier. Is buying that new TV moving you closer to your shared goals or further away? That's your filter.

Morgan Housel's ""The Psychology of Money"" has an entire chapter on this. People don't struggle with money because they're bad at math. They struggle because they don't have a clear vision of what they're trying to build.

**Step 6: Schedule Money Meetings (yes, seriously)**

This sounds corporate and annoying, but it works. Once a month, sit down for 30 minutes and review your finances together. What came in, what went out, are you on track for your goals, do you need to adjust anything?

This prevents the ""surprise"" fights. No more ""Wait, you spent HOW MUCH on what?"" Instead, you're both staying informed and making decisions together.

Use an app like Rocket Money or YNAB to track everything so you're not manually adding up receipts like it's 1987. The app Honeydue is literally designed for couples and shows you both your spending in real time.

For deeper understanding of relationship dynamics and money psychology, there's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content from books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like financial compatibility and relationship communication. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific, like ""navigate money conversations as a couple"" or ""understand my partner's spending psychology,"" and it pulls from quality sources to create tailored podcasts. The length and depth are customizable, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It's built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content is vetted and science-backed. Worth checking out if you want structured learning that fits into your commute or gym time.

The Gottman Institute found that couples who have regular ""state of the union"" talks about money, sex, and household responsibilities have way lower divorce rates. Shocking, right? Talking about stuff actually helps.

**Step 7: Don't Hide Your Spending (financial infidelity is real)**

About 40% of people in relationships admit to hiding purchases from their partner. This is called financial infidelity and it destroys trust faster than almost anything else.

If you feel like you need to hide spending, that's a red flag. Either you're overspending and know it, or your partner is too controlling about money. Both problems need to be addressed directly.

Financial therapist Brad Klontz says hidden spending usually isn't about the money itself. It's about shame, control issues, or fear of conflict. If you're hiding things, you need to figure out WHY and have that conversation.

**Step 8: Plan for the ""What Ifs"" (because life happens)**

What happens if one person loses their job? What if someone gets sick? What if you break up (yeah, uncomfortable, but necessary)?

Happy couples talk about the scary stuff BEFORE it happens. They have emergency funds. They have a plan for who keeps the apartment if they split up. They know how they'll handle medical bills.

This isn't pessimistic. It's responsible. You have car insurance even though you don't plan to crash. Same logic.

**Step 9: Remember You're on the Same Team**

The biggest mindset shift that separates happy couples from miserable ones: stop seeing money as a competition. It's not ""my money"" vs ""your money."" It's ""our life"" and money is just the tool you use to build it.

When your partner spends money on something you think is dumb, take a breath before freaking out. Ask yourself: Is this actually a problem or am I just being judgmental? Are they staying within their ""no questions asked"" budget? Is this derailing our shared goals?

Most money fights aren't really about money. They're about feeling respected, valued, and heard. When you approach money conversations as teammates instead of opponents, everything changes.

Look, handling money as a couple is messy. You're combining two different histories, values, and habits. But the couples who make it work don't have some magical compatibility. They just communicate, compromise, and choose to prioritize the relationship over being ""right"" about money.

Figure out your system. Have the hard talks. Build something together. And for the love of everything, stop judging your partner for buying overpriced coffee if it makes them happy.",1,1769430482.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which app is truly the fastest?**  
A: Shopify Bundles (native) and Libautech (native architecture) have minimal speed impact. JavaScript-based apps add 0.6-1.2s.

**Q: Do I need AI features?**  
A: AI helps suggest smart product pairings automatically. Useful for stores with 50+ products. Not essential for smaller catalogs.

**Q: Can I switch apps later?**  
A: Yes, but you'll need to recreate bundles. Start with your best guess based on needs.

**Q: How much revenue increase can I expect?**  
A: Industry data shows bundle apps typically increase AOV by 20-40% when properly implemented. Results vary by product type and store.

**Q: Should I use multiple bundle apps?**  
A: No - causes conflicts, slows site, and complicates management. Choose one comprehensive solution.

**Q: Is free Shopify Bundles enough?**  
A: For basic testing, yes. For revenue growth, you'll need analytics, AI, and multiple bundle types from paid apps.

1qneml5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongHaulersRecovery/comments/1qneml5/90_recovered/,90%+ recovered,"I got COVID in January 2022. I was almost hospitalised and it was the worst sickness I'd ever experienced. 

I had lingering effects and was prescribed antibiotics which probably made it worse. 

I thought I'd gotten better a few weeks later but three months later things went sideways. 

I struggled to sleep, was tired all day, had diarrea and stomach issues and just felt like a corpse. 

After a month, I started taking antihistamines (Allegra/Telfast) which helped a lot but it was still rough. 

I started taking supplements and getting vitamin and mineral infusions (intravenously) and slowly winding down my activity levels as I realised how little I could handle. 

After six months, I was about 70% better but would often crash after periods of exertion or stress and sometimes just feel exhausted. Mornings were always hard and there were times I could barely function. 

Crashes felt like I had a cold and would last several days. 

I slowly improved over the following years but the crashes always came and went and mornings were still tough. 

The worst was when I went on a 30km hike in the Andes and had a crash so bad i was projectile vomiting several days later. It felt like my body just stopped ingesting food. 

I went to a Long COVID Clinic in 2025. I had just become a father, which had meant a lot of stress and no time for looking after myself. 

Before COVID, I was ripped and in incredible physical health. The last few years and the first months of pregnancy saw my weight climb to 93kg. 

I was 78kg before the whole nightmare started. 

They diagnosed me with sleep apnea and told me that losing weight would help with that and long COVID. They also told me to eat a better diet (Mediterranean). 

They also added an H2 antihistamine. 

I took their words to heart and stopped sugar then and there. After a couple of months, I upped my game and counted calories. I spent four months being hungry but did notice improvements. 

No alcohol, no junk food, no added sugars. 

I also kept taking all the supplements and medications I'd been taking. 

LDN, H1 and H2 antihistamines, amitriptyline, NAC, vitamin C and D, fish oil, Curcumin, melatonin, statins etc. 

They all helped. 

And then, the icing on the cake was this month. 

I watched the Zoe podcast on evidence based nutrition and changed my diet to focus on fibre and wholefoods over protein. Rather than clean food with lots of protein from meat, I cut down meat in favour of as many nuts, legumes, vegetables, fruits and whole grains I could find. 

This gave me that extra 5% boost where I now feel 90% to 95% recovered. Maybe even more. 

My diet is quite intense. 

My morning breakfast is black coffee and a bowl of overnight soaked rolled oats with chia seeds and silken tofu mixed with nuts and berries. 

My lunch is generally a two egg omelette with a salad with lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes and rye sourdough. 

My dinner usually includes a small piece of fish or chicken (or occasionally red meat), legumes, vegetables, nuts, spices, and black rice.

I have fruit salad when I want a snack. 

I finally feel like myself most of the time.

I can tolerate weight training and walks. I am slowly pushing my energy envelope too. 

I don't wake up tired. I can function normally most of the time. 

My hypothesis is that my gut microbiome was screwed over by COVID and opportunistic pathogens came in and wreaked havoc on my system. 

Years of pacing and medication and the last six months of diet have restored the good bacteria that support healthy immune functioning. 

This last part is still an open question in medicine and I am not a doctor. 

But whatever it was that caused this: I'm just grateful. ",3,1769430252.0,LongHaulersRecovery,1,1.0,False

1qnem1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/spoonfulofreason/comments/1qnem1u/whats_new_on_the_topic_of_food_addiction/,What’s new on the topic of food addiction?,"At the intersection of neurobiology and nutritional science, among other areas, we are also addressing food addiction. In everyday language, we often say we are addicted to coffee or cake. And although we will not find a diagnosis of food addiction in medical encyclopedias, this issue is actively discussed, researched, and reformulated to include new details.



The phenomenon we are discussing is not just about liking certain foods very much. The problem is that we lose control of our behaviour. For example, the Yale Food Addiction Scale measures compulsive eating (when we eat more than we planned, even when we are not hungry), tolerance (the need to eat very strong-tasting foods to feel the same satisfaction), withdrawal (irritability or headaches if we stop consuming sugar or heavily processed fats), and continued consumption despite harm (weight gain, diabetes, or emotional difficulties). Studies show that natural foods (such as apples or steak) do not usually cause such reactions.



Over the course of evolution, our brains have learned to choose foods that provide the most energy. Modern food additives act as a ""super stimulus,"" triggering a powerful response from the dopamine system. A fresh peach may cause a moderate release of dopamine, but a glazed doughnut can cause a huge dopamine spike. Natural foods rarely contain equal amounts of fat and carbohydrates, whereas processed foods are often high in both. It is common in foods associated with strong hedonistic desires (e.g., chocolate, doughnuts, ice cream). The more dopamine a food causes to be released, the more we want it next time. As with other addictions, the more often we eat such foods, the weaker the brain's response becomes due to desensitization, but the stronger our desire for it (because we mobilize additional motivation to achieve the same pleasure we felt before), because constant stimulation of dopamine receptors reduces their sensitivity, In addition, the effect of the frontal lobe of the brain weakens, making us less inclined to control our behavior. Under such conditions, sensitivity to stress increases, which often leads to emotional eating.



There is another problem with industrially produced food—it is often very soft, so it takes less time to chew; it contains significantly less fibre, and the substantially more intense sweeteners and umami-flavour-imitating additives do not affect leptin, the satiety hormone, in the same way as regular food. As a result, we feel full later and have more opportunities to eat more high-calorie food. Over time, we no longer seek such food for pleasure, but only to feel ""normal."" All this means that a lack of willpower does not cause the phenomenon; rather, it is the effect of modern, artificially created food on the brain, which lacks the mechanism to respond to it appropriately.



Research shows that about 14 per cent of adults and 12 per cent of children may have an addiction-like reaction to processed foods. This phenomenon can have a powerful impact in communities with a high proportion of low-income people, where so-called ""food deserts"" can actually be ""addiction zones."" However, an individual's reaction to highly processed foods depends heavily on their genes, environment, and choices, so it cannot usually be compared across people.



Here are some tips for dealing with unhealthy food cravings:



* Focus on the healthy foods you want to add to your diet, not the ones you should avoid. After all, you can't eat everything, and if you eat healthy foods first, there won't be any room left for unhealthy ones. Choose foods that are high in fibre first.
* Take care of your environment—don't create conditions for ""eating with your eyes,"" don't leave food you don't want to eat in visible places, and limit your presence in areas where such food is offered or sold.
* If you don't want to give up a particular product right away, replace half of it with a healthier alternative, gradually increasing the proportion of healthy food.
* Plan your withdrawal reaction – the most challenging part is the first 2-5 days of not eating the chosen product. It will be easier later, so plan engaging activities for those days.
* The reward response to healthier food will develop faster and be stronger if you eat mindfully, slowly, and, of course, make sure it tastes good.
* Before eating, make sure you are NOT angry, lonely (or otherwise emotionally uncomfortable) or tired, so that you do not create a harmful cause-and-effect relationship.

1qnek80,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1qnek80/reading_article_todays_topic_is_geopolitics/,Reading Article : Today;s topic is GeoPolitics,"# Welcome to the American Winter

The six-car ICE convoy came to a stop and instantly dozens of people swarmed it, cellphones in hand, while others ran out of nearby houses—I saw a woman in gym shorts in the 20-degree weather—and began surrounding the masked and heavily armed agents who had spilled out of their black SUVs. The fury in the crowd felt almost like a physical force, as real as the cacophony of whistles and honking cars and angry chants: “ICE out! Fuck you! Go home!”

The officers threw a protester to the slushy asphalt and piled on top of him, then cuffed him and dragged him away. The screaming only got louder. With their escape route blocked by protesters and their cars, the agents tossed out tear-gas canisters, the white clouds billowing up into the winter air. An injured man stumbled past me and vomited repeatedly into the snow.

From where I stood, a few yards back from the scrum last Wednesday afternoon, it looked, at best, to be a savage caricature of our national divide: on one side, militarized men demanded respect at the butt of a gun; on the other, angry protesters screamed for justice.

But behind the violence in Minneapolis—captured in so many chilling photographs in recent weeks—is a different reality: a meticulous urban choreography of civic protest. You could see traces of it in the identical whistles the protesters used, in their chants, in their tactics, in the way they followed ICE agents but never actually blocked them from detaining people. Thousands of Minnesotans have been trained over the past year as legal observers and have taken part in lengthy role-playing exercises where they rehearse scenes exactly like the one I witnessed. They patrol neighborhoods day and night on foot and stay connected on encrypted apps such as Signal, in networks that were first formed after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.

Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution. Vice President Vance has decried the protests as “engineered chaos” produced by far-left activists working in tandem with local authorities. But the reality on the ground is both stranger and more interesting. The movement has grown much larger than the core of activists shown on TV newscasts, especially since the killing of Renee Good on January 7. And it lacks the sort of central direction that Vance and other administration officials seem to imagine.

At times, Minneapolis reminded me of what I saw during the Arab Spring in 2011, a series of street clashes between protesters and police that quickly swelled into a much larger struggle against autocracy. As in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, Minneapolis has seen a layered civic uprising where a vanguard of protesters has gained strength as many others who don’t share progressive convictions joined in feeling, if not always in person. I heard the same tones of outrage from parents, ministers, school teachers, and elderly residents of an affluent suburb. Some of the quarrels that divided Minneapolis city leaders only a few weeks ago, over policing or Gaza or the budget, have faded as people have come together to oppose ICE.

“Overall, this community has exercised enormous restraint,” Allison Sharkey, the executive director of the Lake Street Council, which represents many minority-owned businesses that have been hit hard by the ICE raids, told me. “But we have been pushed, probably intentionally, towards civil unrest.”

And as with the Arab uprisings, there is profound unease about where it is all leading—especially now that two people have been shot dead in scenes like the one I witnessed—alongside an undertow of hope that Minnesota can provide the rest of the country with a model of democratic resistance.

O

ver the past year, a three-story brick building in south Minneapolis has become a magnet for people who feel they—and their neighbors—need protection from their own government. The nonprofit that runs training sessions there asked me not to identify its location. When I visited, an ebullient labor organizer named Emilia Gonzalez Avalos was standing onstage in front of a packed auditorium, talking about the facial-recognition technology used by ICE agents, who routinely photograph protesters. “Everyone is at risk now,” she said. Behind her, a screen offered bullet points on how to legally observe ICE raids.

Avalos told me that 65,000 people have received the training, most of them since December. “We started in a very different tone; it was preventive,” she said. Now, after Good’s death, “people are understanding the stakes in a different way.”

I went upstairs to see breakout sessions where people were being trained for direct confrontations with ICE. Inside a classroom, several dozen people ranging in age from 14 to about 70 faced off against three trainers playing ICE agents, in a loud fracas that lasted several minutes. Afterward, the trainers offered the volunteers a critique. One gray-haired lady said she had found the exercise difficult, “not being a ‘Fuck you’ person.” Others got tips on how to brace themselves more effectively so that the agents could not easily knock them down.

Before I left, I watched the trainers put the group through two more simulations: an unexpected ICE raid on a neighbor’s home and a planned demonstration at an airport that ICE is using to deport people. The second scenario appeared to come to life a few days later, when about 100 clergy members were arrested for protesting at the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport.

The participants I spoke with did not seem like typical protest types. One of them, a driver’s ed teacher who asked me to identify him only as Dave, told me, “I do not like confrontation at all, and that’s another reason that it’s weird I went to the training.” But in light of what is happening around him, he felt he needed what the trainers had to offer. His 14-year-old daughter, who attended the training with him, told me, “It was kind of overwhelming. But I don’t think it could be too much, because they’re just being realistic.”

The nonprofit groups that run these training sessions are not organizing or directing the anti-ICE protests taking place in the Twin Cities. No one is. This is a leaderless movement—like the Arab Spring protests—that has emerged in a spontaneous and hyperlocal way. The people who follow ICE convoys (they call themselves “commuters,” a verbal gesture that is part joke and part effort to elude government surveillance) have organized on a neighborhood basis, using Signal groups. The man who drove me to the ICE raids I witnessed—a lawyer, activist, and social-media figure named Will Stancil—had a cellphone fixed above the windshield of his car, and I could hear people tracking the location of the ICE convoy as it passed through their neighborhoods on a Signal audio chat. It was like being inside a police car that is getting updates by radio from a dispatcher.

You do not have to get tear-gassed to observe all of this self-organization; it is visible to anyone walking through Minneapolis. One bitterly cold morning, I approached a man standing across the street from an elementary school, a blue whistle around his neck. He told me his name was Daniel (he asked not to be identified further, because his wife is an immigrant) and that he stood watch every morning for an hour to make sure the kids got into school safely. Other local volunteers come by regularly to bring him coffee and baked goods, or to exchange news. These community watches take place outside schools throughout the Twin Cities, outside restaurants and day-care centers, outside any place where there are immigrants or people who might be mistaken for them.

“It’s kind of unorganized-organized,” Daniel said, when I asked how the school monitoring worked. “George Floyd connected everybody.”

The local networks that formed after Floyd’s killing were not just about fighting racism. During those febrile weeks in May and June of 2020, there were looters and provocateurs of all kinds on the streets, and so much anger had been directed at the police that they pulled back from parts of the city. Many neighborhoods began organizing local watches simply to defend themselves.

I recently got into the tiny RC world and picked up one of those 1:64 FPV RC cars. Super fun, but I honestly couldn’t get along with the app it came with.

I’m a developer, so I ended up spending a lot of time building my own controller app just to make the experience better. I uploaded it recently and figured it might be useful for others who own the same car.

It’s completely free, no ads, no in-app purchases. I built it purely for fun and to improve the experience.

* Gyro driving
* PS5 controller support
* Video upscaling to make the 720p feed look better

This is definitely something I would call and friendly date. I do really just want good company because I have not been doing enough.work.and staying home is making me sleep all day. I want a good cup of coffee and work so I'll be at UDA Cafe in BF Homes, Paranaque starting at 9pm. They close at 1am and maybe we can eat tapsilog somewhere after.

First off, I am very very sad today. I'm leaving my lattes to one or two max because their coffee is strong as fuck. I just need enough so I'm forced to fixate on work. I'm bringing my gaming laptop since I use it for work so I might play games in between. I just don't wanna be holed up in my room. It sucks 🤣

I will pay for one cup of coffee for you in exchange so I just ask that you are:

\- a decent kind person, knows that I'm sad, and not a total ass about it. Just understand the value of mental health.

\- older than me. I'm sorry but I prefer to be around the company of someone older than me tonight. It's just a preference.....I get along better with people older.

\- we can BOTH co-work that will be beneficial.

\- would be nice if you're pretty but it doesn't matter in the end....it's a nice bonus but most importantly I just ask that you're a nice person, compassionate, and overall decent.

About me:

\- sad, tired and needs to get back on track. 

\- I do finance related stuff for a living. I make good money but I'm in a shittier spot than usual.

\- since I'm asking for a pretty date—I will confidently say I'm good looking. I'm almost 6'2, medium built, dresses well, well kempt, and I look more Chinese than I am Filipino.

\- speaks primarily English. Get ready for your nosebleed 🩸 but I am technically NOT a foreigner. Just a Filipino raised abroad in a land of caucasian idiots.

Anyways, hope to find somebody soon. I prefer if we swap Instagrams (no dumps please) so I can verify you and you can verify me as well.

Ganheinde brinde os filtros sibarista. Tenho mais 2 b3 sobrando, depois só timemore e cafec abaca.

Tem alguma dica?

A primeira receita com o filtro rapido ficou melhor mesmo com a agua mais quente entregou menos sabor da torra. A primeira receita realçou um sabor mais suave que talvez remeta a mimosa e tambem dava para sentir um pouquinho do cravo.

A segunda receita ficou mais amarga e realçou sabor de pêssego.

Mesmo não tendo acertado a receita esse café ta gritando potencial. Preciso de uma ajudinha antes que minhas 125g acabem.

Estou pensando em fazer uma receita, provavelmente com o b3 ou com o filtro cafec abaca, mantendo a agua a 91c° e usando 1 bloom de 30s e 1 pour. Segunda opção seria 90c° e 2 bloom de 30s em vez de 45s + 1 pour.",1,1769429174.0,CafeEspecialBR,1,1.0,False

He told me he was extremely tired because he had partied with his friends the night before. I suggested he take a nap for an hour since we had other plans later. But before going to sleep, he insisted that we have sex.

When we got to his place I saw him go straight to bed without showering. I told him I wasn’t comfortable having sex like that, knowing he didn’t shower since the day before and after a big night out. He seemed surprised and a bit annoyed, but for me it just didn’t feel hygienic.

I'm pretty annoyed myself cause this happened also with a few of my ex bfs and it was part of the reason they're ""ex""...

I feel like they are not conscious that hugging and having a dirty d*ck inside my vagina is disgusting and can be dangerous. Or maybe they know it but don't care.

Is it unreasonable to expect someone to shower before sex, especially after partying?

1qne5n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1qne5n9/24f_always_love_a_good_conversation/,24f - always love a good conversation,"hey!

even though the title might suggest something short-term, i’m actually very open to finding long-term friendships. but they can’t be forced and should grow naturally

i’m genuinely serious about meeting new people, so no worries about getting ghosted. the only boundary i want to be upfront about is that if a conversation starts off nsfw, i won’t reply.

a little about me:

• i’m from europe

• a serious coffee addict who works at a coffee shop (clearly fate)

• introverted and a bit shy at first, but once we vibe i always come out of my shell

which can be easier with some people!

proceed with caution .. slight sob story ahead

i just went through a breakup and by that i mean it happened about five months ago, and while i usually process things on my own, moving on has been harder than expected. i’d really appreciate having someone i can vent to occasionally.

that said, i totally understand if that’s not something you’re interested in. just let me know early on so i’m mindful of it later.

when i’m not working (or bawling my eyes out), i’m usually gaming. i play minecraft and world of warcraft (not very well), and about once a year i fall back into a league of legends or valorant phase. i’m always open to trying new games, especially if they’re aesthetically pleasing.

i love horror games! the thrill of being scared.. but i rarely play them alone (this is your sign to play phasmophobia with me).

i also enjoy reading, mostly romance, and i love discussing books or getting recommendations.

right now i’m on a self-discovery / self-improvement journey. most of my free time is in the evenings because during the day i’m either cooking the blandest meals known to mankind, spending time in nature trying to hit 10k steps, or very recently started going to the gym.

if you have hobbies you’d love to share, i’d be genuinely excited. i’d love to discover things i might enjoy that don’t involve my laptop.

of course, this is just the basics. i’d love to talk and slowly show you more of who i am, and i’m equally excited to get to know you. having common ground would be great, but if we don’t, don’t let that stop you. preferably you’d be around my age or older :)

anything from casual conversation to a committed friendship is welcome. replies don’t need to be instant! a few hours between messages is completely fine. this is meant to be a low-pressure environment where no one owes constant explanations unless you’d want to.

sometimes i do love communicating more in the form of voice messages than plain texts so you’re more than welcome to send me those!

lastly (and a bit randomly), if you’re religious, i’d love to hear about your personal experiences. i’m agnostic and very curious about different perspectives.

It seems lili has instructed the night watch that  I do this often  I can only remember couple other times . The older man I forget his name said it looked like rain so I better go inside  . I’m glad he  was talking to not wake me up  as I still have nightmares but not as often 

I need to thank lili and who the man was 

Well back to yesterday / today  weird writing this late , Liz was already at my door at dawn with that big grin, thermos of coffee in hand. We walked down the path together, sand still cool under our feet. water was nice  Liz splashed me once, called me “dreamy accountant.” She is as I was a few years ago in another life 

After, we dried off and drank coffee at the restaurant real beans “people from across space keeping gifting us packages “ and eggs with herbs from Liz garden. Sat outside watching  boats bob. She talked about the new landscaping project by the brewery . Jeff is a nice guy keeps talking about cigars  and he and the SM hang out  , I guess that’s normal as about the same age ,”  like Liz and I  “  rambling again 

how she’s planting salt-tolerant blooms to hold the dunes. I just listened, mostly. Her voice makes everything feel lighter. We’re good together like that—no need to fill every silence.

  by mid-morning. I went straight to The Ledger. Numbers waiting, as always. Balanced the weekly ledger for the town—irrigation parts came in under budget thanks to that bulk order I negotiated last week with th uh Liz dad logistics guy 

Ordered more nutrient packs for the greenhouses . Everything adds up, but it’s tight , soon the credit transfer and we will be good Even give people some credits  . Wyatt’s barony growing fast, people keep coming but that is Aino job  

Sent financial summary to Wyatt this afternoon. He’s still out on the Nori Navio—Black Ship business, whatever that means exactly. I wrote a little extra in the message, not just numbers. “Weather holding fair here. Beach swim was nice. Hope the void isn’t too lonely.” Then deleted half of it before sending. Felt silly. He probably reads these reports on a datapad while eating sweets with Clara , Cynthia  not thinking about some accountant back on the ground who wonders if he’s okay. But I send them anyway. Every week. Maybe he notices the care I put in the details. Maybe he doesn’t.

Afternoon I walked alone for a bit. Took the long path past the flower fields Elizabeth started . I love flowers, mom I miss you if I ever have a daughter I’ll keep flowers on the table like  mom did 

Liz checks the old barons gardens there weekly And wants me to go in a couple days . Place is quiet, overgrown in spots, but beautiful. I almost told her how much I miss having someone to share quiet moments with. Almost told her about Wyatt. But the words stuck. She knows me too well already, probably guesses anyway. Sure most of the women think the same as I do about Wyatt  

when they were painting Some of us women got the young men to talk about the battle  . Wyatt is why we are here . He is so kind yet so ruthless . I wonder what is family is like 

Thinking about tomorrow. Another swim if no rain, more numbers, another report to send. I better get back to sleep as Liz will be here in another 5?hours

1qndwuf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qndwuf,I was thinking something about AMP suits and other human equipment,"They are much bigger than an average Na'vi and i was wondering if it's supposed to be a symbolic representation of humans perceived superiority over Na'vi since in comparison to them, humans and small and weak so they need to use technology to ""artifically"" make themselves appear bigger and stronger than they actually are.

Maybe i'm looking too deeply into this but what if it's supposed to represent the main theme of the movie that humans ""superiority"" over the ""savage"" Na'vi is just fake because without their gear they stand no chance against them in a fight.
Na'vi don't feel the need to compensate for anything because they are just the way they are and they are proud of it.

I feel similar in the hometree destruction scene, we see dragon and helis flying over Na'vi, towering them and making them looks small in comparison to the RDA's might, we see them shooting arrows at disinterested Quaritch and him sipping coffee showing how much he just doesn't care about them and their desperate attempt to stop him.

It's fitting with his character, he wants to be on the top on Pandora, he wants Na'vi to fear him even if despite how much of a experienced soldier he is any Na'vi could easy kill him in a dorect hand to hand fight.

In reality, we told them multiple times we were cold and we want to get some coffee... and they just stood there (like, legit stopped walking). Told us they didn’t want to go. So, we ignored the fact that they’re not walking anymore and went to get our coffee and get warm. But now, apparently that’s makes us terrible people for putting our health above them.

I don’t know if it’s worth mentioning, but it’s not the first time. A similar situation happened a while back, they stopped in the middle of the walk just so we wouldn’t walk away. And I got pretty pissy about it because I clearly communicated I needed to get warm. And I got frostnip after that.

So, I’m morally torn. Because I feel bad that they’re upset. But on the other hand… Throwing a temper tantrum over the fact that we left because we didn’t want to get frostnip (again)? And we told them multiple times it’s cold (and invited them to come as well, to which they refused)? I explicitly stated where we were going, why and told them to come with us when they stalled (because they noticed us drifting off).

 And honestly, I don’t think they even understood what this was about. Because the last thing they texted us before blocking us was something about ""it’s not fair to leave just because the vibe is off"" (which was not the case lmao). They unblocked us and we sort of talk now, but they’re pretty much giving me the cold shoulder.

1qndulv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HauntedRouter/comments/1qndulv/dollimination/,Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa.

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",1,1769427887.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1qndoui,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qndoui,Chamonix in mid-Jan (Ski Trip Report),"My partner and I (31M) recently returned from a week-long trip in Chamonix. I’d like to share some thoughts and tips that might be helpful for anyone considering a trip there. This is not sponsored but I had such a fantastic time that I wanted to write everything down - this will be a long read!

I was hesitant about skiing in Chamonix due to many people saying it’s not the best for beginners. However, as someone who had only skied a bunny slope once as a teenager, I was pleasantly surprised to find plenty of pistes suitable for all levels. The greens are fine for beginners and there’s a particularly long one in Flegère that is good training before blues. 

We booked a great deal through WeSki for £1.1k per person, travelling from London. This included flights, transfers, hotel accommodation, a ski pass (Mont Blanc Unlimited) and ski rental for a seven-day trip in mid-January (11-18). We were quite lucky in terms how quiet it was in low season and the heavy snowfall just the week before ours.

# Stay:

Hotel l’Oustalet was the perfect home away from home that had alpine charm in spades. The staff are incredibly friendly and every interaction was met with a warm smile. Our room was spacious, tastefully decorated with wood accents and boasted a balcony that overlooks the mountain range. The private sauna and steam room is free to reserve for every guest  - no doubt we made the most out of this after a hard day.

# Ski:

We went to 4 different ski areas - Les Planards, Brévent, Flegère & Les Houches. The bus system means that it’s best to focus on one area per day.

**Les Planards:**

Small ski area with 2 green bunny slopes, a blue and red piste. We came here on our first half-day as we were feeling a bit tired and ill. Great for absolute beginners to get their ski legs. 

**Brévent-Flegère:**

Large ski areas connected by multiple chairlifts and cable cars. Incredible views from the top.

For absolute beginners, I recommend starting at Brévent. It offers two bunny slopes and a slightly longer green piste that loops back to the Plan Praz cable car. Flegère has two longer green runs (Trappe and Libelulles) that are slightly more challenging and requires more endurance. This is where I practiced most and improved my technique for parallel skiing.

Brévent is great if you’re a beginner-intermediate because of all the different levels of blue runs. Some are harder than others and I had to learn the hard way - do NOT attempt Blanchots if you’ve never done blues before, there’s a long steep bit that caught me by surprise. Equally, the Chavanne piste in Flegère is not for the faint of heart.

The blue run I did the most was the Parsa/Vioz piste that starts at the Plan Praz cable car - lots of wide bits and a gentle introduction to steeper gradients. 

If you’re up for the challenge, the circular route across Brévent-Flegère is great fun. Here’s the route: Parsa - Sources chairlift - Access Flegère - Liaison cable car - Evettes (tiny bit down) - Evettes chairlift - Evettes (from the top; a meandering run that’s narrower in width) - Liaison chairlift - Retour Brévent - Charlanon chairlift - Sources - Parsa chairlift - Retour Brévent.

The only challenging bits were the steep slope in Access Flegère and the tricky funnel (steep and busy) that occurs before the restaurant at Flegère. For the return trip back to Brévent, I would suggest taking the gentler Evettes route that snakes behind/on the left side of the Flegère restaurant if you’re not confident about the steep section on the right side of the restaurant (I almost gave up because of this). Apologies for the confusing word choice, it makes more sense when you’re there.

**Les Houches:** 

My favourite ski area with lots of long runs, but a pain to get to from Chamonix Sud. I suggest coming here after it’s snowed a bit due to its lower elevation. The buses will be full and it’s a 30 minute ride with lots of stops. There’s supposed to be a direct bus but we never saw one.

I suggest going across the valley from Bellevue as there’s a run called Piste à Leon that’s practically flat with scenic views. 

From Prarion peak, there’s plenty of long blue runs that were more substantial than the ones in Brévent and Flegère. Mélèzes and Chamois had a wide field with bunny hills that are at their best early in the day before they get a bit choppy. La Cha has stunning vistas with several steep (but short) sections that are great for practicing. Abbaye is the longest one that snakes across the slope with varied sections - there’s one section that is steep and slightly longer but perfectly doable as a beginner-intermediate. All of the above finish at a narrow and choppy bottleneck before the chairlift, which could be a bit of a challenge if you’re not able to control your speed. The green area is very wide and has similar bumps to those on the blue pistes.

# Food: 

Chamonix surprised us with its diverse and exceptional food quality. We particularly enjoyed two restaurants: Breizh Café for its elevated take on Breton galettes made with buckwheat flour, and Smile Taco’s for its impressive selection of beers on tap, high-quality tacos and overall vibe. As a meat eater, I particularly loved the cod fish taco. For classic Savoie fare (no pun intended), we visited La Calèche, also known for its charming alpine interior that blends cosy and kitsch. I wanted to order fondue but my pescatarian partner meant we couldn’t share. However, both the porcini tartiflette and the guanciale version were standout dishes. All places mentioned had warm service and I highly recommend visiting at least once.

# Shops:

Le Refuge Payot (specifically the one on Rue Joseph Payot) - Specialty food shop focused on local produce and ingredients 

Shouka - Quality “bean-to-bar” chocolate, coffee and cacao-related products from around the world

Arpin - Luxury homeware store with alpine aesthetic specialising in their in-house textiles

Fresh Air - Design-led gift shop with dedicated jewellery section

# Tips:

	1. Allow plenty of time between your arrival and transfer if arriving in Geneva Airport. We arrived in the early afternoon and the line at immigration took us 2 hours to get through. We missed our transfer and we were booked on the next available bus that was 3 hours later.

	2. Bus times and capacity depends on timing (peak hours - frequent but busy). Best to check status on Chamonix app. On that note, it’s also worth checking ski lift openings/piste & weather conditions through the app before visiting.

	3. Visit Aiguille du Midi on a sunny day. You will need to book in advance even if it’s free from your ski pass. This is a once in a lifetime experience. Dress warm and bring snacks in case of dizziness.

	4. Consider piste orientation, altitude and weather conditions. Brévent-Flegère is south facing so the sun hits the slope in the afternoon. Les Houches is lower in altitude so it’s best to visit after snowfall.

	5. Watch piste run videos on YouTube to familiarise yourself if you’re not feeling confident. This was particularly helpful after I realised not all blues were equal.

	6. Bring blister plasters. Get the ones from Compeed or hydrocolloid tape for cushioning and waterproofing. Even better if you can get leg protectors like socks with foam/padding.

	7. We wanted to make the most of our skiing so we didn’t do the après at Folie Douce SG. I believe you can take the train from Chamonix to Saint Gervais les Bains and take the various cable cars all the way to the top.

	8. Lots of clearance sales in Dec-Jan so there’s no need to buy all your gear in advance. Ski gloves and accessories are marked down massively. On that note, a pair of good ski gloves are worth it. Choose skis and poles with a rubbery inner surface for improved grip. Ones with extra fabric at the end lets you tug on them so you can take them on/off easily.

	9. Improve your fitness before skiing. Focus on working out your lower body (specifically your quads, calves) and core and you’ll be happier on the slopes. Exercises that focus on strength, endurance and stability will help you last longer on the slopes.",5,1769427396.0,chamonix,2,1.0,False
1qndog8,https://i.redd.it/xxth4d00kofg1.jpeg,This stupid scene makes so much sense today.,"I had to let go of Robin. My Robin. 

When I was one, I moved to a new apartment. I became friends with him - let's call him H. 

I have memories since I was around 5-6 yo, which means H has been a part of literally every big moment of my life. 

I was nothing less than a menace (probably why my parents only had one kid haha), the kid who punched boys and got sand in her hair everyday. He was the prim and proper kid that my parents told me to be like. And that means instant friendship!!!!

When we were 10, he kissed me when we were playing hide and seek. When we were 11, he made me promise him I'll marry him when we grow up. We made a pinky promise...you know how sacred those are! When we were 13, he moved to a boarding school for rich people. And you know how kids are, how fast we were at moving on - so fast that I forgot him maybe in a month? 

He smuggled in a phone to message me on facebook (remember facebook and farmville? Good ol' days) and that was the only form of communication between us. One day, his teacher caught him and suspended him for a week. I remember him coming home and his father beating him the whole evening with a belt as he screamed with pain. I remember crying in my room listening to his screams. I cried myself to sleep that night. 

And then we lost each other completely. We grew up, I got a boyfriend, he got a girlfriend, we hung out when we were in the same town. He'll always be the boy who wrote poems for me, did my homework, the first one to run his fingers through my hair, looked at me with awe and wonder, hated every guy I ever dated (""Him? Really? He's not good enough!!!""), taught me how to tie a reef knot just before an exam (right over left and pull and left over right and pull - I'll never forget), the one who gifted me a prism and called me a rainbow, the one who congratulated me for my engagement and disappeared. 

I know he needs his space. I know I'll never have a conversation with him again - nothing except happy birthdays and ""let's meet for coffee"" and never meet for coffee. 

My dad mercilessly teases me with every crush's name, including H. My mum is extremely perceptive - there are only two guys she has ever liked for me. One was H. The other is the one I'm about to marry.

My love for my guy is visceral - he's my person, the one I loved in my last life and the one I'll love in my next and every life. Which is why I have to let H go and find his own destiny. I guess this is goodbye. Bye bye, Robin.  ",44,1769427363.0,HIMYM,2,0.98,False

Hi everybody! I have released a new version of my app **Habits** and I would love to hear your feedback.

Unlike standard launchers that just show your ""most used"" apps, Habits tries to predict what you are going to use right now based on your past behavior at this specific time and day.

**Link:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nick.applab.habits](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nick.applab.habits) 

**What you get in Habits:**

**- Contextual Predictions:** The widget adapts to your routine. It serves up news apps with your morning coffee and switches to streaming or music for your Friday nights :)

**- Smart Learning:** It doesn't just count clicks; it builds a local statistical model to understand your daily routines and habits.

**- 100% Privacy Focused:** No servers, no tracking. All data processing and storage happen exclusively on your device.

**- Long-Term Memory:** The app creates a historical database to improve accuracy over months (unlike the standard Android history which only lasts a few days).

**- Data Ownership:** You can export/import your usage history database, so you don't lose your personalized model when switching devices.

**- Minimalist Widget:** Designed to blend into your home screen while saving you time searching for apps.

💰 For any position, (agent, higher level, etc) make sure na alam mo na agad ang salary range in the interview. Waiting until the job offer is a waste of time or a sign na shady ang practices nila even if you eventually get a good offer.

🎯 Marami magsasabi na walang career progression sa BPO. That's true to an extent, but only if you stay as an agent. Kahit lumipat ka pa ng company or even tumaas sahod mo, try your best to eventually move past the agent role unless you're content with just being that. 

🚀 Be willing to be go out of your comfort zone for a better position or title kasi madadala mo yun if/when you decide na lumipat sa ibang company. Ang ultimate goal mo is pag nag update ka ng resume, yung position na customer service/technical support is nasa pinaka dulo na or completely wala na.

🙋🏻‍♂️ Ask around sa mga tenured folks kung ano ano ang mga positions for growth. Dun mo malalaman or at least mabibigyan ka ng idea kung willing ka ba mag stay or hindi.

🤝 Kung mahirap/toxic man ang account, the people around you will help you stay so make good friends. Customer service is never easy; hindi ka cashier.

💔 Dont be a people pleaser. Gusto nila mag eat out after shift or gusto mag team building pero ayaw mo or hindi ka makakasama kasi may sarili kang rason? Dont join; you dont owe anyone your time. Wag ka magpa pressure sa mga banat na ""sige na di ka na nga nakakasama...""

🚩 Wag ka ma pressure sa mga banat na ""libre naman na regular ka na!"" or kung ano mang mga ganyang similar na banat. Ilibre mo sila kung gusto mo mismo.

📊 Dont blindly chase metrics. Aim to learn the processes and fundamentals and get better at call/chat handling thru experience . When you get better, you will meet the metrics by default. Will it be hard? Sure, maybe.. Walang madali; hindi ka cashier.

🧠 Tenured agent =/= magaling. Maraming tenured agents na basura. They can perform the troubleshooting since may mga articles, SMEs, and guides, pero makikita mo ang tunay na galing ng agent sa call handling instead of their troubleshooting.

⚠️ Walang mabait/masamang QA; ang meron lang is magaling at hindi magaling na QA in terms of pano ka nila bibigyan ng coaching or how they can make you improve. Wag sisihin ang QA sa maling nagawa mo sa call; ikaw yung nakagawa ng mali sa call, trabaho nila to point it out to para hopefully maiwasan. Mas okay nang QA mag point out ng mali mo kesa mismong client.

🎓 The nesting period is the best time to make mistakes and/or ask questions coz that's the literal point of that period where you learn about the processes and other stuff. Basta wag lang mga zero tolerance policy and ma commit mo. Wag ka ma pressure na dapat pagkatapos ng nesting eh alam mo na lahat.

I have severe emet, and have had for years but have been doing much better the last couple years thanks to therapy and medication. But. The last year, I’ve become obsessed with avoiding diarrhoea and soft stools. It started as a fear obviously linking to “what does this mean, does this mean I’m sick etc” but slowly it’s taken over an entire part of my life. I’m completely terrified of softer stools or diarrhoea. I think my chronic constipation doesn’t help. I’m never ever in the position of having softer stools or experiencing urgency etc due to my constipation. Guys, this fear of pooping has literally become on par with my fear of vomiting and it’s really starting to annoy me. I have compulsions including taking Imodium when I probably don’t need to (chronic constipation!) and I’m worried about damage I could be doing to my gut systems. Even today, I had a very anxious day yesterday having coffee out, which is a fear for me incase it causes pooping. I took an Imodium yesterday, and spent the whole day anxious. This morning my poop was softer than usual (type 4! Considered perfect btw!) and of course, I’m an hour deep in a huge panic attack about if this means sickness or if it will happen again. I ended up taking *another*  Imodium. I’m annoyed with myself and annoyed with this fear as I felt I was in a good place with my emetophobia a year ago, and my OCD decided it needed something else to keep me living in fear.

Does anyone have any tips or tricks for this type of emet/ocd? I have a therapist but just a talking therapist, and I take propranolol MR for everyday anxiety symptoms. I’m also on the list for TMS therapy for OCD. Sending love to you all - recovery isn’t linear and I know there will be ups and downs. But this down is really starting to piss me off.",1,1769426103.0,emetophobiarecovery,1,1.0,False

1qnd4l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1qnd4l9/i_operated_without_meaning_for_4_years_and_almost/,I operated without meaning for 4 years and almost nearly went bankrupt. What I learned about finding meaning and motivation again:,"I'm a therapist and product leader (18 years in tech, currently IBM). In my practice I spend a lot of time talking to people who've ""made it"" but feel empty.  
This loss of meaning usually hits mid-career... and it's rarely what people expect it is.

Typically you've done the same job for so long that  there's no challenge left. Or you've reached your definition of success and realised... wait... this is it?

For high achievers especially, impostor syndrome is normally the source of fuel.  
You work extremely hard because you feel ""not enough."" Then the day comes when  you hit your goals, look around and ask yourself: ""Is this all there is?""

Sometimes it's in your environment: I've watched people in SaaS burn out like chickens because the industry is so competitive that everyone's playing on super hard mode all of the time.  
You're exhausted, things barely work, successes are rare and at some point you think: ""What's the point of killing myself to make this business more money?""

The thing is, when people ask ""what's the meaning of this?"" they're really asking ""am I good enough?"" It's an intellectualised version of the same question.  
If you were wildly successful at this game, would you still question if it makes sense? I don't think so.

**! Understand this before you quit your job or start that business:!**

The loss of meaning is multi-factor. Some reasons are real and rational, others are circumstantial. I've seen people do a slight industry pivot and find meaning because their work suddenly helps people in a more tangible way. A few others found it by taking a break, starting a hobby, or monetising something on the side for the challenge.

I've also seen people leave corporate jobs thinking entrepreneurship will save them, only to realise they just traded one type of shit for another type of shit they hate more.  
Then they fall into a deeper crisis because, well -  they didn't like the first thing, don't like the second thing - now what???

What worked for my case:

I went on without meaning for 3-4 years, lost clients and nearly went bankrupt. Really bankrupt. Ironically, the process of making back that money gave me meaning and drive again. So did the therapy work, helping people one-on-one.

But a year before this, if you'd asked me, I would've said that I'm not cut out to be a therapist.

I had to go through very structured exercises to deeply understand: What makes me feel whole?

This question is insanely difficult because when you're happy and whole you don't notice it.  
Those moments pass directly to the subconscious, skipping your active awareness.

Anytime you're thinking ""does this make me happy?"" you're not there yet.

I had to ask: Who am I? What do I love doing when no one's watching? What's my default activity?

For me, the answer was in front of my eyes the whole time: using my skills and knowledge for helping people but I just couldn't see it.

It took isolation, reflection, me-time, and crucially… I had to stop worrying about finding meaning in order to find it.  
Three or four years of intensive effort, and then one day over coffee something just clicked.

My advice if you're “in the fog” right now:

Don't make big decisions while you're still in crisis.  
If you think running a business will make you happy, run it on the side first. If you think changing companies will help, send some resumes. If you think golf will help, play golf.  
Try minimum viable versions of these things while you still have stability.

You might not be supposed to find meaning in your corporate job either, that might just not be its purpose. I've seen people treat their 9-to-5 as the source of every problem until they lost it and realised the grass wasn't greener.

The meaning might be in front of your eyes, you just can't see it yet because you're too deep in the crisis and the pressure clouds you.

Get some distance. Find a mirror - someone who can help you see yourself clearly.  
It's hard to be the driver and the observer at the same time.",10,1769425531.0,ProductManagement,2,0.81,False

This started when I joined a new company. I was new and quick to make friends, and that’s when I met John (34M). He was sweet, quiet, and a little unconventional. His appearance didn’t quite match his job, which somehow made him even more intriguing. From the beginning, we clicked easily and became fast friends.

By my second year at the company, we had grown much closer. We’d hang out after work, grab coffee, and text fairly often. He was consistently kind, caring, and thoughtful qualities I deeply valued in him as a friend.

A big part of what I love about him is how genuinely decent he is as a person. He helps others without hesitation, treats everyone with kindness, never looks down on anyone, and is very good at his job. He’s the type of person who is quietly reliable and good-hearted, which is rare.

Eventually, people around us started to notice how close we were. Our bosses even assumed we were dating because we were always together. Others commented that we looked at each other differently. At first, I brushed it off as a joke until I realized I had developed real feelings.

I finally decided to confess via text. I told him nothing had to change, but if he wanted to try something more, I’d be open to it.

His response was gentle but hesitant. He said he’d like to get to know each other more, but he doesn’t really want to be in a relationship right now. He wants to see where things go naturally. To me, it felt like he wasn’t fully closing the door but he also wasn’t opening it.

Through a mutual friend, I learned he’s reluctant to start relationships because of his current circumstances. He’s extremely busy with work and deeply committed to his family. Because of certain personal situations, he doesn’t want to drag anyone else into that. I also get the sense he might be jaded from things he’s been through. Our friend mentioned that other girls have liked him before, but nothing ever came from it. One thing she did say, though, is that I’m the person he’s most often alone with.

I respect him immensely for his honesty and boundaries. Truly. But at this point, I can honestly say I love him. He’s one of the best people I’ve ever met kind, genuine, and truly good.

That said, while I understand and respect where he’s coming from, I’m still holding onto hope.

I've found over the months and years of engaging with lucid dreaming that the odds of having one are always greater whenever my physiological state is somehow different from my baseline. For example, when I had coffee every day routinely and then stopped it: boom, lucid dream! 

Most recently, I've been in the hospital for two weeks now and noticed that I had an unprecedented number of lucid dreams here. Maybe it's the medication.

I've thought about possible explanations. Maybe an altered physical state means that you are in a state of higher attention, more removed from routine?

What are your experienced with this? Drugs? Medication? Coffee? Even exercise? What about days where you experienced unusually much?

  
Look forward to gather perspectives from my fellow lucid-dreamers!

*I fell for time immeasurable. I fell through an ever-expanding expanse. I fell until I could remember no longer. When my descent began memories danced in front of my eyes, filled with such colour and vibrancy, filled with all who had entered my life. As I raced towards a bottom that never seemed to come all the colours began to drain away, words falling from the pages of my life, leaving behind only pristine white pages unmarked by the years of information they once possessed. I continued falling until nothing of myself was left, only self-awareness remaining, all else expunged with the passage of time. I fell with darkness all around me, I fell until I did not. In one moment, I was falling, the next I was not. The near infinite descent over. Now I stood in the same darkness that had shrouded me throughout the fall. No memories remained, no part of who I was, only a faint recollection of my own existence. I stood staring out into that darkness. Slowly, images began to form in the distance. I could see trees deep within the darkness. Leaving the place where I landed behind me, I took a step towards the trees.*



 

 

 

 

**Around**

 

He adjusted the fork, making sure it was parallel with the knife. He glanced at the clock on the wall, 4:30, still half an hour before they were due to arrive, enough time to do one last check.

He stood back from the table admiring his work. Eight places set, the silver polished to a mirror shine and all resting upon the white tablecloth.

'Perfect, if I do say so myself,' he said.

Who was coming again? Why am I laying the table?

Everything had to be perfect, just like last time. It had been a while since he had entertained the family. He was beginning to miss the noise that came with having a house full of children and the joy that they filled the rooms with. They gave the house life and changed it from cold unfeeling bricks and mortar, into a home. Now it was only him and the wife. The children had long since flown the nest and now had children of their own.

They are not coming. They cannot come here. No one else can.

He walked to the mirror mounted in the hallway and admired his reflection as he traced his hands along the deep-set creases of his face. Each line was testament to his longevity and well lived life.

'Hell, I may be old, but I still got it,' he said, winking at his mirror image.

 He smiled widely, revealing a full set of teeth. They looked even better than he remembered. He had always had good teeth, but he was sure the bottom row was usually more crooked than this. Perhaps his teeth had caught his good spirits. He could not help staring at himself, even his face looked ten years younger. His white hair was more vibrant, and the signs of thinning had disappeared.

That is not my face anymore. I am no longer him. I need to leave.

He adjusted his tie making sure it was central before running his hand through his thick hair.

He continued down the hallway to the foot of the stairs, wondering what was taking her so long.

'Are you ready yet, dear?' he called. 'The children will be here any minute.' He heard the hair dryer spring to life sounding like an aeroplane taking off. 

She was always like this, the same at eighty as she was at eighteen, taking forever to get ready and leaving it to the last minute. He had lost count of the number of times they had nearly lost dinner reservations because she needed 'five more minutes'. He had told her time and time again that he liked her even better without all that mess on, but she never listened. The thought brought a smile to his face as the hair dryer continued to rumble in the background.

 She doesn't need it anymore. The door is right there. Go, now!

He turned towards the front door. He reached for the doorknob, and his hand began shaking uncontrollably. It looked older than before, more weathered, and lifeless. His skin was pulled tightly across his bones, covering the fingers like a fine dusting of snow. It appeared as if the slightest movement could blow the skin away. He recoiled. Eventually he opened his eyes but struggled to make out his surroundings. He began blinking rapidly, trying to focus. He stared at his hand and noticed it had returned to its usual state.

'You're going crazy, old man. First thing Monday morning we are going to the Doctor's.’

He turned away from the door and looked up the stairs. The staircase seemed longer than he remembered. The hum of the hair dryer still droned on as she continued to preen herself.

Perhaps I should go check on her, he thought, as he placed one foot on the bottom step.

Don't go any further. The door is right there.

He stepped back onto the hallway floor. What was he worrying about? She always took this long. It would be more shocking if she were ready by now.

'I'm going to keep an eye out for the family, love. Don't be too long now, you wouldn't want to miss them,' he shouted up the stairs.

He went into the living room and headed towards the window. Outside the street was silent and still. A usual Saturday afternoon in this cul-de-sac, inhabited by pensioners like himself, people who had bought their houses when regular people could afford reasonable sized housing without fear of bankruptcy or repossession. As he observed the street, he remembered his time here as a young man. It seemed so different back then. It was alive with children playing in the street and kicking balls around. His own house practically had a revolving door as his children and their friends were constantly in and out. There was a joyfulness in the street that no longer existed. It had become a sterile place, full of the elderly like him and his wife. Nice kept gardens and picket fences, everything orderly. It was now a place where you got your affairs in order while waiting for your time to end.

I finished waiting a long time ago.

If not for the occasional visit from relatives, this street would not raise a sound other than the hum of a lawnmower.

He scanned the street looking for any movement.

'They had better arrive soon, or the food will get cold,' he said. 'It's got to be almost time that they were here?'

He glanced at his wrist but was greeted by the pale band of skin that usually had a watch on it.

I must have left it in the bedside cabinet, he thought.

He stepped away from the window and could feel a dull ache in his legs, another sign of the numerous years he had endured.

'I need to sit down. These old bones aren't what they used to be.'

He sank into his armchair, his pride and joy. She hated it, said it was ugly and that it didn't go with anything else in the room. He didn't care, it was comfortable, and he had fallen asleep many times in it on those lonely nights when she was at the...

That's right, she spent a long time there. She was scared and alone.

What was he on about? They had never spent a night apart in over sixty years of marriage. He must have got too comfortable in the chair. Nearly dozed off, his mind playing tricks on him.

'Crap, they will be here any second,' he said, as he jumped up from the chair with an agility that defied his age.

He looked to the carriage clock on the fireplace. It was gone. Usually, it was nestled among the other ornaments his wife liked to display. It was a wedding gift. He thought it was ugly and dated back then, by today's standards it was hideous, but his wife loved it and refused to get rid of it. She had probably taken it to be repaired again. That thing was always breaking.

It never breaks. Why else would she have kept it for so long?

He noticed the big vase of flowers sitting on the coffee table. He was fairly sure that they were not there yesterday. She must have bought them today. They were beautiful and the smell coming from them was intoxicating. The scent filled the room. How had he not noticed the smell before? It was everywhere. The room could have been filled with flowers the scent was so overwhelming. They possessed colours richer than anything he had seen before. They were drawing him towards them.

I know what they are. I have seen them before.

He placed his nose amongst the flowers and inhaled. The scent dissipated in an instant and was replaced by a choking sterility. It was so clear that he could almost picture himself in a hospital ward. The nurses and doctors all around him busy taking care of patients. The brilliant white that delivers so much darkness was everywhere. He could taste the disinfectant in the air and hear the electronic pulsing of the machines. He was there clutching something in his hands. The sweet smell cut though the clinical environment. His hands were outstretched offering the item up. He saw the smile he received in return.

Keep going.

He opened his eyes and was back in his living room. The smell was gone. He wiped a tear from his eye as he stepped away from the wilting flowers.

What was keeping her, he wondered. If she kept this up, she would still be up there when they arrived.

Once more he headed to the foot of the stairs. As he neared, the sound of the hair dryer increased.

'How much longer are you going to be?' he said. 'This is taking a long time, even for you.'

He went to look at his watch but remembered he had left it upstairs.

I might as well go and get it, he thought. I can check on her at the same time.

He looked up the near endless staircase, stretching further than he could see.

Time is running out. I need to turnaround. I can still leave.

He began his ascent of the staircase, and the hair dryer stopped.

Must be just about done, he thought. I still want my watch though.

He continued to climb the stairs, each step taking more and more out of him. His breathing gradually became more laboured. Fresh tears began to form in his eyes, stinging and blurring his vision, but still he continued to climb. Eventually he could see a white light in the distance. He pressed on. With each step the light was a little closer. The air grew colder, and he began to shiver, his suit offering little protection from the plunging temperature.

'It's freezing up here. Did you turn the heating off?'

It is always cold here and it always will be. I need to escape this.

He continued upward; the light was near now. He was almost there. He could smell her perfume lingering in the air. That smell he loved so much. The same one she wore on their wedding night and on every special occasion since. He had never tired of it in all those years of marriage. It still enraptured him now.

It was guiding him up the stairs, getting stronger the nearer he got, beckoning him closer. The light was so close now that it dazzled him, but the cold was increasing. He could feel it getting under his skin and beginning to permeate his bones. His teeth started to chatter, but the perfume pulled him onward. He could almost touch the light. His arm reached for it, only inches away, then it disappeared as if it was never there. He stood on top of the landing. The icy chill had lifted, and he looked down the stairs. He could see the hallway below, only thirteen steps down as usual.

He made his way to the bedroom door and

I know what is waiting for me in there. No more, please. Not again.

He slowly pushed it open. The room was empty, but her smell hung in the air and the clutter on the dressing table made it clear that she was here a moment ago.

'Must be in the bathroom,' he said.

He moved towards her dressing table and began to examine the items. Various beauty products were scattered about. Then he saw something that was out of place. A matted, brown mess, he picked it up, a mass of hair. A brown wig like his wife's hair, but nowhere near comparable to it. The clinical smell rose again. He was there once more with his arms giving up their offering, that smile, her smile. He could see the flowers he had brought her and how she smiled when he gave them to her. It made his heart race. She looked so different back then, barely anything left of her and the way that that wig was resting on her head looked bizarre. She was still beautiful to him, with or without hair. That smile and to hold her in his arms was all her ever needed from her. He held her close and as tightly as he dared without risking causing her pain. She felt like a bag of bones entrapped by a casing of skin. He could see every movement her joints made under her skin but still she was all he wanted.

I need to get it together. Stop searching and escape. I am almost out of time.

He let go of the wig, the tears flowed constantly.

Where have they got to? They should be here by now, he thought.

'Come on then, love, let’s get downstairs,' he called out. 'They will be here any second.'

As he was about to leave the room, he remembered his watch and headed towards the bedside cabinet. He bent over to open the drawer but stopped when he noticed a stain on his pillow, blemishing the white with a yellow mark that looked like an overripe bruise. His hand moved towards it. As his hand came into contact

I should have listened. It's too late now. It will happen again.

He saw it all. The body struggling underneath it, the strong arms forcing the pillow down, covering the frail frame, waiting for its movements to cease. The end of its existence and its pain. He could see himself at the end of those arms, tears cascading down his cheeks. His mouth sounding, I love you, over and over in some perverse mantra.

I was her salvation, but who will be mine?

His arms relaxed, and he lifted the pillow away. The body wore a smile on her pursed lips, the final smile she would ever give him. His leaned over and kissed those cold lips.

No more, I can't do it again. I need this to end.

He raised his hand and wiped the tears from his eyes. The stain had gone.

Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me, he thought. Looks like I'm making a trip to the Optician's as well on Monday.

'I'll meet you downstairs, I'm just grabbing my watch,' he said.

He pulled open the bedside cabinet. His mouth filled with a metallic taste, the back of his head began to throb, and a dizziness overcame him. He fell back onto the bed and touched the back of his head. A stickiness coated his fingers; he looked at them and noticed the red liquid.  With one hand he pulled his wife closer. With the other he placed the barrel in his mouth.

'I love you, beautiful,' he said as he held her close.

Not again. Please God, I can't take it again.

He got up from the bed and pulled the white sheets taut, eliminating any creases. He made his way downstairs.

They would be here soon, he thought as he strolled into the dining room to check on everything.

He adjusted the fork, making sure it was parallel with the knife. He glanced at the clock on the wall, 4:30, still half an hour before they were due to arrive, enough time to do one last check.",3,1769424550.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

If we were to trade favorite poems or songs tonight, which one would tell me the most about who you really are?",1,1769423829.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1. their reservation system is quite confusing.

2. food was too expensive for the taste. We felt like the quality, quantity and taste is better priced at 400-500 only. too overpriced. their plates were sadly ceramic looking plastic.

tldr: he was defusing a bomb and only trusted himself with the wires.

hey y'all. thank you for waiting and caring. recap for those who haven't seen my other posts last year, my fiancé got a new assistant (Rachel) and I kept seeing signs he was cheating but he always had a very reasonable explanation. the loudest comments were a wake up call to gtfo, but there was just something off about the whole thing. yes he was putting my trust through the ringer, but only for moments had i thought i put too much trust in him. i had to detach emotionally to protect myself without crumbling my future

so… yeah this is my story, tldr at bottom. 

remember where we left off? off putting document full of Rachel screenshots promising to ""go to hr with"". him swearing she was just ""getting a little intense"" like their repressed desires weren't repressed enough. Everything about his relationship-and-career-gambling actions in the document just seemed off.

So I let him show me what he wanted me to see, and asked him if he really thought his lack of professionalism would slide with hr. he said he'd set firm boundaries in personal documented chats, but i got the sense that the whole evidence gathering was an empty cover. anyways, Rachel seemed the type to enjoy seeing how far she could get over the line and stay in the clear. So with the fish out to dry, I started to look less for confirmation he was cheating, and more for ANY other possible explanation for why he and Rachel were so close. so, the ever deepening feeling of doom made me sick enough for the truth that i hired a PI. yeah, I decided life was an open world game and tried on the detective hat.

im going to tell this like it unfolded to me to try to be the least confusing. probably none of this will make sense if you haven't read from the start. i got a little creative with the writing so you get the full experience like i did. 

**exposition**

the PI was technically just my cousoin, but he was committed to specializing in ""domestic investigations"" which sounds classier than ""finding out if your man is cheating."" 

what he found was really confusing.

turns out Rachel wasn't just some random new hire. the PI and I went through our place while he was at work, and we found an pair of old seminar name tags in my fiancé's grad school box. last name ""Monroe"", (and it should have clicked with me day one) that his late mentor was Rachel's mother. She was THE mentor who wrote his references, opened doors, and launched his whole career 6 years ago. turns out sweet sweet Rachel used to be an awkward 18-year-old who had tagged along to a university event when my fiancé was in grad school. she got a massive crush on him, but she looked completely different back then. different hair, different style, different everything. i still didn't have the full picture, because she couldn’t have just been hailey biebering my fiancé. 

The thing that kept me up at night though was apparently my fiancé's career was being subtly sabotaged by one oh his superiors that we’ll call “Executive X”. It seemed to go on right up until he started ""messing with"" Rachel at the time of my first post, at which point he was suddenly, miraculously placed in charge of the LA expansion. 

meanwhile, at home, i stopped trying to dig deeper with him, anyways he'd shut me down with ""just trust me, it's complicated, but it's almost over."" and because i loved him (still), and knew something deeper was going on, i played his game. unfortunately his game was becoming increasingly less present. he'd make me avocado toast while i was getting ready for work, ask me to pick a wedding font that feels ""tight"" … but then he'd stop mid-sentence like he was censoring himself. 

**the weekend**

he told me he was taking me to this company party in LA. ""just for fun,"" he said, ""so you can meet the whole crew before we transition to the next phase."" He told me this is a huge night for us (the corporate tense of ""us""), and quickly pivoted to the actual ""us"" by saying its a chance to finally move past the ""Rachel drama."" he made it sound like a fresh start. He bought me a pale blue dress and I had my hair curled. i practiced smiling in the hotel elevator because i wanted to make a good impression.

nervewracking, but everything down to the smiles looked expensive so i assumed people were just focusing on themselves.  executives everywhere. and Rachel?

oh my dears, Rachel was glowing.

even when i drink i remember the soft pink dress that hugged her stomach, and even though it was barely noticeable, i was already looking for signs. my chest and gut folded together like a bad memory and a future anxiety.

my fiancé introduces me around, and i gave my best while meeting names i’d seen on letterheads. He kept his hand on my lower back the whole night, and it felt a bit performative. Rachel, the reason i barely see him anymore, comes over and says, ""You look lovely. He talks about you all the time."" i wasn't going to say anything about the potential affair in front of all the eyes on me. i ask her how she enjoys my fiance's professional direction. she admires that he's a man who does what he needs to do. I peel off to use the restroom and be alone for a bit. 

around 9pm, this woman from Exec x's team corners me by the bar. ""you're a saint,"" she says, drunk and loud. ""i couldn't handle my man spending that much time with his gorgeous mentee. especially now that she's glowing."" she gestured toward rachel's stomach and winked.

I don't remember dropping my glass or walking out but I remember the nausea, the ringing in my ears, and my fiancé yelling my name.  

the whole room saw the betrayal blooming across my face and the bruise it left. he grabbed my hand as i was pushing the elevator buttons. 

""she's pregnant,"" i said. statement, not question.

he was quiet for a long time. behind us, through the glass, i could see rachel watching us. she had tears streaming down her face.

""yes,"" he finally said.

""is it yours?""

""no.""

i actually laughed. ""then whose? because the PI i hired seems to think you've been meeting her in hotel rooms"" he couldn't explain, so i left that night without him. i didn't know what i wanted to do at this point. was I so wrong to put my faith on the line to believe that his intentions always have been good? i flew back home the next morning. he gave me space, texted once a day to check in but didn't push. 

**lore drop**

he said he was finally ready so we met up at 2am sitting in our living room with documents spread across the coffee table, he looked like he'd aged years. he said he ""i hated every second of it,"". his excuse was he tried to protect me from the danger of knowing but he knew he had to be the villain. 

he told me Rachel had been sexually assaulted by Executive X powerful, connected, protected by NDAs and hushed settlements. She got pregnant. But  her family's company was merging with Executive X's corporation. Her late father's legacy, hundreds of pensions, everything depended on it.

Rachel was trapped. if she went to the authorities, if she named him, the merger would collapse. her family would be ruined. her father's legacy destroyed. conservative family background meant the shame would be unbearable. and Executive X had the power and resources to discredit her completely - make her look like a liar, a blackmailer, someone trying to sabotage a major business deal.

office rumors about her pregnancy had already started circulating. people were looking at Executive X. whispering.

so after hours one day, he found Rachel in a vulnerable moment in his office and she confided in him under his ask. 

 seeing an opportunity, he made a deal. not with Rachel. but with Executive X's superior, someone who apparently had been looking for a way to contain Executive X without blowing up the entire company.

The stupid master plan: Create a convincing fake affair. If everyone believed my fiancé was the father, suspicion shifted from Executive X. The merger proceeds. Rachel gets relocated to LA with a key promotion for safety and distance. In return, my fiancé bargained for the LA expansion project he'd been sabotaged from getting.

That meant manufacturing evidence. Screenshots. Receipts. Intimate playlists. Scripted happy hour lines. Dinners. The café breakdown. The white heart texts.the relentless onslaught of phantom infidelity. 

the HR notes he showed me WAS a cover, to explain his true preoccupation. his REAL notes were a secret dossier on Executive X's actions, on the pressure Rachel was under, documentation for potential future use if the deal collapsed or if Exec X retaliated.

and my pain... a genuine stab through the heart in public, that was clearing conditions for the business to move forward. 

yeah. what the fuck. 

When HR was eventually involved, they were only told about ""concerning workplace closeness"" and approved the LA relocations as a standard solution to an ""optics problem"", never knowing about Executive X, the assault, or the real conspiracy

he had to keep me in the dark. my real reactions - the jealousy, the distress, the mounting evidence i kept finding - to sell to Executive X and everyone watching. my devastated face walking away from them in that hallway at the part was the ""proof"" Executive X needed to see that the ""affair"" was real and messy enough that the best solution was to sign off on the LA relocation for both of them, to extricate the ""problem.""

if i had known, if i had been in on it, i couldn't have sold it. my performance had to be genuine because it wasn't a performance at all.

he weaponized my love by turning my trust into a tool all to save someone else.

and I looked at him, at this brilliant, flawed, arrogant man who took on an impossible burden for the sake of a promise to his mentor. a man who was willing to let the world, and even me, think the worst of him to protect a victim. a man who played a dangerous game and won, but almost lost everything that mattered.

**presently**

the engagement is on hold. he took back the ring, said ""when you give this back to me, i want it to mean something real, not something you're clinging to out of habit.""

he's in LA now. so am I, actually. we moved out here two months ago. separate apartments, but in the same building. the monthly LA visits that used to tear me apart? those were legitimately for the expansion project and for providing ongoing support to Rachel in her isolated new situation.

we video call most nights, even though we're literally three floors apart. sometimes we just sit in silence on the call while we both work. we're more honest now than we've ever been, but there's this invisible chasm between us that im waiting to be bridged. 

Rachel called me two weeks after everything came out. we talked for an hour. she told me about her father, about the assault, about the impossible choice of staying silent or losing everything her dad built. about how my fiancé had been the only person who was on her side, who could actually DO something. ""i wouldn't wish this on anyone,"" she said. she didn't ask him to do it, she wanted to leave but my fiance wanted to leverage the LA expansion and ideally let everyone win at my expense. 

the baby is due in spring. she didn't drink the seltzer at trivia that night, if you remember.

i believe her (and i hate that i do). she needed a way out. he gave her one. but he never gave me a choice in what i lost to make it happen.

**epilogue**

so here we are. the merger is signed. everyone's pensions are secure. Executive X was ""retired"" with his golden parachute muzzle, but at least he's gone. Rachel's safe in LA with a good job and a support system. the baby will be born in spring and never know any of this story.

Rachel wants to be part of our lives. like, actively. she's asked if she can raise her baby with us as a support system. she's developed this... i don't even know what to call it. this attachment to my fiancé that goes beyond gratitude. she looks at him like he hung the moon. and i get it, but there's just too much i need to untangle. 

my fiancé is mature enough to maintain boundaries. he knows she's not ""new and exciting"" anymore, that the thrill of the game is over. but i also see him light up sometimes when he's talking to her about the project, about her ideas, about the baby. not in a romantic way. in a ""i saved you and that makes me feel powerful"" way that i'm not sure is healthier, honestly.

we're figuring it out. the three of us have dinner once a month. once a month i want to flip a table, but she's alone here. her family basically disowned her when she refused to come home. and despite everything, she's just a kid who got destroyed by a powerful man and is trying to build a life from the rubble.

i'm not a saint. i don't love this arrangement. but i'm trying.

i'm still waking up every day feeling like my insides are bruises turned inside out. battered, but crown intact.

he says he planned our whole wedding during this mess. that he picked our first dance song. that this was all for us in the end, that protecting the merger meant protecting our future too. but all i can think is: he saved her & everyone by breaking me.

the thing that keeps me up at night isn't whether he cheated. he didn't. not in the way that matters. but he chose to protect someone else by sacrificing me, and he made that choice unilaterally. he played god with my pain because he didn't trust me with the truth. would there have been a world where he could have let me in on all of it and still played it out the same? he says no. 

the beauty of it all though on reddit is that everyone in the comments warning me, calling out the red flags, y'all were sharing your own wisdom and pain you've grown from. i was surprised that multiple people dm'd me had gone through nearly the exact same situation. hopefully this story stands to show that maybe there is a bigger story at hand, that being insane like me and looking to keep our faith through it all. sometimes the truth is hiding behind the red flags, and sometimes your gut knows something your brain can't prove yet

do i trust that he did something noble? yes, actually. i do.

do i forgive how he went about it? i'm working on it.

do i still love him? yes. and it burns.

he sacrificed his queen to win the game. maybe he promoted another one. but the board is empty now, and we're left staring at each other across it, trying to figure out if we even want to play anymore. if we come back from this, it'll be because we both chose it with clear eyes, knowing exactly what we're capable of doing to each other, and deciding that's a risk worth taking.

what would you do?



***TLDR****: Rachel is my Fiancé’s late mentor's daughter. Rachel was a victim of SA by an executive at my fiancé’s company, and got pregnant. Rachel's family’s company was going through a merger with my fiancés company… so Rachel kept quiet from the police and her uber conservative family, breaking silence only to my fiance who saw a little too much. so he brokered a deal with the execs to make it look like HE was the one who had an affair with his young perky assistant to manage the Rachel situation, in exchange for the lead role on the new LA development. He had to keep everything from me in order for my authentic reaction to sell the affair to the company and especially the exec at a party, so everything went smoothly. that shit blew up directly in my heart, and he told me everything. in the end he saved her, he saved the company, he got what he wanted, all at the expense of my considerate constant stress, gambling that my faith wouldn’t break.* 

*He put the engagement on hold out of respect and moved Rachel and I out of the situation to the new development in LA. Rachel had the baby, the paternity test said it’s not my fiancé’s, and we are not part of it even though she has mentioned we’re something of a support system. I live in the same building as him, and*

1qnclze,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qnclze/how_to_actually_thrive_on_a_plant_based_diet_the/,how to actually thrive on a plant based diet: the science that works,"I’ve spent months deep in plant based nutrition. Podcasts, research papers, nutritionists, long form interviews, real world trial and error. And honestly, most information out there falls into two extremes. Hardcore vegan propaganda or aggressive meat eater fear tactics. Neither is useful.

What actually works is much simpler. Eating plant based is not about removing meat. It is about understanding what your body needs and learning how to meet those needs intelligently without relying on the standard Western diet.

Here is what I wish someone had told me at the start.

stop thinking “what am I giving up”

Your brain is wired to focus on loss. So when people consider plant based eating, they immediately think about burgers, chicken, cheese, comfort food. That mindset is why most people quit fast.Flip it. Think about what you are gaining. Research discussed on the Rich Roll podcast with Dr Michael Greger shows whole food plant based diets are linked to lower rates of heart disease, type two diabetes, and certain cancers.

Start by adding plant based meals instead of cutting everything out. Build momentum without triggering mental resistance.protein is not the problem people think it isEveryone panics about protein. But protein deficiency is extremely rare in developed countries unless someone is severely under eating.

Legumes, lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, quinoa, nuts, seeds. These are legitimate protein sources. A cup of lentils has around eighteen grams of protein. Tempeh has over thirty grams per cup.

Dr Garth Davis explains that the real problem is not lack of protein. It is people replacing meat with bread and pasta and wondering why they feel terrible.Track your food for a week just to understand your intake. Most people realize they are already hitting their protein needs.

B12 is non negotiable

If you eat plant based and do not supplement B12, you are risking neurological damage, anemia, and long term fatigue.B12 does not come from plants in meaningful amounts. Even animals are often supplemented due to modern farming practices.

Take B12. Weekly high dose or daily low dose. Simple.

Dr Michael Greger’s book How Not to Die breaks down the science behind nutrition and disease prevention in a way that is surprisingly readable. It will challenge a lot of assumptions about food and health.

iron needs strategy, not fear

Plant iron is absorbed less efficiently than animal iron. That does not mean you are doomed to anemia.Pair iron rich foods like beans and spinach with vitamin C. Lemon juice, tomatoes, peppers all boost absorption. Avoid tea and coffee around meals because they block iron uptake.Check blood levels once a year. Supplement only if needed. Many people do fine just by eating smart.

eat variety or get bored and deficient

Plant based diets unlock huge diversity in nutrients, but only if you actually eat diverse foods.Different colors mean different compounds. Tomatoes, carrots, leafy greens, berries, cruciferous vegetables, beans, grains.Most people fail because they eat the same five foods repeatedly. Make it a habit to try one new plant food every week.

fat is necessary, just choose wisely

You need fat for hormones, brain function, and vitamin absorption.Prioritize whole food fats like nuts, seeds, olives, avocado. Minimize heavily processed oils when possible.Get omega three from flaxseed, chia, hemp, walnuts. If needed, supplement with algae based omega three.

fake meats should not be your foundation

Impossible burgers, vegan cheese, mock meats can help transition, but they are ultra processed.Treat them like occasional foods, not staples. The core of your diet should be whole foods. Beans, grains, vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds.

meal prep makes or breaks consistency

If you rely on hunger based decisions, you will default to junk.Batch cook beans, grains, vegetables, sauces. Make meals easy to assemble.A simple formula works well. Grain plus bean plus vegetable plus sauce. Mix and match.get blood work and track reality, not vibes

Check B12, iron, vitamin D, omega three index, metabolic markers. Fix problems early instead of guessing.

Most deficiencies are easy to correct if you monitor them. community matters more than people admitGoing plant based alone while surrounded by skeptics is draining.

Follow people who actually live this lifestyle. Listen to long form discussions. Normalize your environment.

Also, do not become preachy. Let your energy, health, and results speak.real talk

Plant based eating is not magic. You can eat garbage on plants too. But done properly with whole foods, smart supplementation, and planning, it can be one of the most powerful upgrades to health, energy, and longevity.The science is there. The athletes proving it works are there. The food is good once you learn how to cook it.

The hardest part is ignoring people who have never tried it telling you why it will fail.",2,1769423748.0,MenWithDiscipline,1,1.0,False
1qncjgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1qncjgp/thoughts_on_ayitl_s01e04_fall/,Thoughts on  AYITL S01E04 Fall,"I've been revisiting this episode because there's one or two scenes I want to look back on before I can expand on something with confidence. I think that indulgences aside, like almost the whole Life and Death Brigade sequence including the Beatles number, this is the best paced of the four episodes because it had to reach a conclusion and wasn't spinning wheels to mark time. The only good things about it were the conversation between Rory and Logan where he gives her the key, her returning it the following morning as a symbolic parting gesture and the farewell between her and Colin and Finn (what's wrong with being from New Zealand?).

Lorelai Gilmore meets Dipper Pines (when you're familiar with Gravity Falls you can't not hear it). The Pacific Crest trail even goes through Oregon, maybe near a certain tourist trap and a diner with a waitress named for a piece of furniture for serving food? Kirk would be perfect for the town of Gravity Falls actually, Waddles and Petal?

Rory visiting the Hartford house is just perfect. Looking at the portrait and note left by Richard (I completely understand why Emily hasn't erased it). The inclusion of video footage and audio from previous episodes is a beautiful touch like it's a seeing out the house on screen in fond memory as Rory begins writing the story that began in that house, in the study of the late but great man who was such a part of that story. Moving ahead, the scene where Lorelai visits to find it's on the market has a lot to talk about. There's a touch of Lorelai and Emily's more antagonistic relationship when Emily assumes the wedding is off and is annoyed Lorelai doesn't see what she's changed around, but it moves to something friendlier when Emily talks about buying the Sandcastle and the name Emily Gilmore being on the deed as it's the first big thing she's bought under her own name. There's a fantastic bookending where Lorelai has an ulterior motive and Emily has conditions, but they're on far better terms with it. Lorelai even toasts ""to the circle of life"".

""Her last name's a first name. I hate that""

\- Michel Gerard (yeah, Gerard is a first name too)

How did a triple homicide go under the radar in Stars Hollow? This is a town where acts of pettiness marked the perpetrator as public enemy #1, and any death is something to make note of (Mr Twickham's very prolonged passing saw Kirk taking the opportunity to merchandise!). The nuns are fun.

Lorelai and Luke finally talking and being on the same page, ready to marry. It feels like a callback to season 6 where Lorelai was waiting for Rory to come home and reconcile before she could marry Luke, here they reconcile when she and Luke have their wedding in sight.

That final DAR meeting is a classic, Emily saying the quiet bit out LOUD on the performative civility. The way she walks between the group and the would-be initiate to look for a biscuit like they're background noise and not even bothering with a napkin, she's not the woman she was back when the show began. Her filter is gone and I love how candid she gets because it's so cathartic on the DAR and the expected role the wives have in their social class. ""So basically you're telling me I'm out."" ""Basically yes, but we don't say it. You're just out. That's how it works."" Emily's parting line is so telling, and putting a line under this part of her life. ""This whole thing is dead to me anyhow. It died with Richard."" Emily doing the presentation at the museum after being motherly to the sick Berta, it's the perfect ending for her. It'd be a bit better if she learned Berta's language though, to show her moving even more out of her old comfort zone. Good to know she's not lost her bite, planning to buy the house next door so Lorelai, Luke and Rory can stay there. I love her final scene, sitting outside in the night, looking out across the sea and the stars, content.

And now one of the scenes I watched this for. The Christopher scene. It's prefaced with Rory in her room making the appointment and looking like she's seriously pondering something, distractedly forgetting her purse. Then in the scene she's not shown drinking the coffee (was that cup at least containing water? Alexis handles it like it's empty) despite her known addiction to coffee and she's very nervous. The fact she's pressing for why Christopher didn't step in as an active parent isn't foreshadowing as much as it's a big sign she's facing the same kind of decision Lorelai had to make about Christopher.

The Dean scene is a nice bit of closure that the original run never gave us. He's living in Scranton, married to a woman called Jenny, three sons (one called Grady who started school and brought home the flu and head lice that the other two subsequently got) with a girl on the way. Clara's life took an unusual turn. Very sage of Rory to reflect on that as much as she wanted to be the older, more mature her when she dated Dean, that it was the experience of dating him that influenced her before that point. Closing the scene on a callback to the shoplifted cornstarch is another great touch on bookending. It's interesting Rory asks for Dean's permission to include him in the book (is she doing this for everyone, did she get Logan's permission at the Tango Club?). To be honest, anyone who was in Stars Hollow at the time will know it's him names changed or not.

Trust Sookie bake many wedding cakes. The memory cake is cute and Sookie level quirky, and Michel getting annoyed before embracing her return, or looking for fat free granola, it feels like the gang is back together again for that scene. Of course Sookie acts like the kitchen she's been out of for two years is hers to criticise the changes for. I know Melissa hit the Big Time, but her seeing Rory again would have been nice.

Of course Kirk has an emotional support pig, and I don't want to hear about how he's upchucked in both bathrooms enough to have a floor preference (which Lorelai is aware of). Jess's idea, I can see people wanting to see him like that (and I wonder if that was a reference to This is Us, where Milo's character very early on has a scene where he has only a small towel to cover his modesty). Jess not having closure over his attraction to Rory is one of the only things not given closure in the episode, but I can see how he's at peace with where things stand which is a sort of closure.

And of course the Final Scene. It's that weird feeling where you know it's the end and that you're not seeing these characters past this point. That sadness of finality. There's a huge blemish in how the Paul thing, which went entirely unmentioned the whole hour and forty minutes, is resolved where Rory finally feels something about how she treated him (""I can't believe how I treated him. I suck""). It's finally some reflection on Rory's part but it's too little too late, and Lorelai dismisses the idea by saying they didn't fit and he'll find someone he fits with some day. It's a shame Rory and Paul not fitting wasn't explored in any way then, I'd have taken a much shorter sequence with the Life and Death Brigade if it meant getting more screentime for Rory to feel more contrite. Notably, Rory doesn't have a wine glass where Lorelai has one, foreshadowing of the Four Words the episode, miniseries and, for the time being, show as a whole closes out on. ""Mom."" ""Yeah."" ""I'm pregnant.""",2,1769423508.0,GilmoreGirls,4,1.0,False
