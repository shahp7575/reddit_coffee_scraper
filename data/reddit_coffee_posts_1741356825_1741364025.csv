My boyfriend was just assigned to JBER, and we're starting to look for homes for him (and maybe me! I work in state gov, so I'm not sure how job-hunting will be now that the feds are, uh, doing less).

What neighborhoods would be good? We're mid-30s, no kids, but would like a townhouse or single fam house. I love outdoorsy stuff, he a little less so, so it'd be nice to have access to both downtown amenities and hiking / adventure-y things. We both like trying new restaurants and any artsy stuff. I'm checking out the theatre and catfe and they are both spectacular, lol. He's going to be working at the base hospital and possibly Providence. 

Are there cool but quiet-ish spots to live in Anchorage? I'd love to have a walkable bar or coffee shop, but also want to have a real garage. Are there suburbs worth checking out? Fwiw, he's from Boston so thinks Anchorage is tiny and hard to traverse, I'm from Dayton, Ohio and think looks large, walkable, and familiarly Air Force themed!",0,1741363551.0,anchorage,2,0.5,False

1j5rqh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1j5rqh5/advice_for_handling_inlaws/,Advice for handling in-laws,"Hi everyone. Looking for some tips on what you do to maintain sanity when staying with extended family. I have always really struggled with my husbands family whether it’s in our home or we travel to them. He is lucky to have his parents and both sets of grandparents alive and well, but I find it overwhelming to be with so many people for such a long time. They also have a very established family culture that I find odd but it’s not really my place to come in and shake things up. 
We’re here for a full week, and even more people arrive tomorrow to meet our son. Some things I struggle with are…
- frequent comments about what I’m wearing. “You do realize it’s winter” etc. I’m lactating and am always warm. I know older generations tend to say things like this, but it’s happening 20+ times a day. I wish I were exaggerating. 
- they all individually ask/comment “is he tired” “maybe he’s hungry” every single time my son makes a remotely fussy sound or face. This can even be 10 minutes after he’s woken up and eaten. They seem to forget that babies just fuss. 
- no/no thanks is just generally not a complete sentence to them. I have to repeat some iteration of no at least 3-4 times before they will let me move along, even with something as silly as offering me chapstick or thinking I need a spoon for my coffee. 

My husband is amazing at standing up for me but there comes a point where I can’t be setting boundaries around every single little thing, you know? They’ve been pretty good at any rules/boundaries we’ve set in place regarding our son, which I’m grateful for, so I’m mostly just looking for tips on how to keep my own peace. I think I just struggle at being with people for more than 2 days or so and with being out of my own space/routine more than anything else, so little things get to me more.

1j5rkpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j5rkpl/starbucks_ceo_a_hypocrite_at_best/,Starbucks CEO: A hypocrite at best,"Niccol [recently announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that hiring for future partners in the U.S. will require relocation to Seattle to work in the head office. Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle for his weekly commute via private jet. A greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): “At Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet. Across our company, we are testing and scaling innovative solutions to support partners, farmers and communities in the face of global climate change.”

 [“Starbucks touts ](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/starbucks-new-ceo-has-a-big-footprint-commutes-private-jet-nevermind-climate-goals-3df1aa5f)its “decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change”, and claims achieving this goal “takes all of us”, it nonetheless has allowed the new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to commute weekly from his California home via private jet”. [“Estimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), “indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That’s roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.” Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote **against**](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. But considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company; let alone the environment. ",0,1741362711.0,starbucks,0,0.5,False

Should be a great place to ask if anyone else has had this issue.  I've only had one stone, back in 2008 when I was in my mid 20's.  Thought I was dying until I finally had to go to the emergency room and found out the issue.  Eventually passed it and haven't had one since.  Here is my situation though.

Ever since then I've been like a 90 year old man when it comes to urination if I drink almost anything other than water. If I drink a diet coke, I'll have to pee 7 or 8 times in the next hour.  Couple of beers does the same thing.  This morning I drank coffee, then a bottle of water.  In the two hours since I've went probably six times. 

I talked to a girl I know who had stones and says the same thing happened to her after.  Is this common?  If it is, I'd like to know if there is a way to help with the situation. ",1,1741362174.0,KidneyStones,1,1.0,False

1j5r3us,https://i.redd.it/bpj1u3cfeane1.jpeg,An example of how my thinking has evolved with reps:,"When I first dipped my toes into these waters, I was concerned about a couple of things: 

1) the flaws. Flaws bugged me and that sent me down the super franken road (that I am still on! 😂). 

2) but the second thing was my thought that it was important for me to only buy reps of a watch that I could own as a gen, or at least would fit my lifestyle. 

When I bought this Clean 60th Anniversary Daytona Platinum, that was a bit of a violation of my Number 2 above. This is a 6-figure watch and as a normal guy with a family, and kids in college (or soon to be in college), you really wouldn’t see me wearing a genuine Daytona like this. 

But I love the watch and got it for date nights, or so I told myself. 

At some point, I just threw in the towel and decided to wear it whenever I wanted. 

I made a post in RepTime about having this watch on in a coffee shop, and how I was positive that nobody would: 1) even notice it, 2) know what it is, 3) think a thing about it and 4) say anything about it. 

This was when I completely changed my thinking about Rule 2 above and found myself firmly in the camp of “buy what you like, wear what you want.”

Over 500,000 saw that post and many had strong opinions. Most comments completely agreed:  wear whatever the hell you want. 

Now I am firmly in that camp.

Buy the watches you like. And wear what you want and enjoy. Anything less is robbing yourself of some of the fun that reps offer. ",10,1741361716.0,wristrepculture,8,1.0,False

I work as a nurse, and my shifts are usually 12 hours long. When I come home, I’m exhausted and just want to relax. The issue is that my husband has very strict cleanliness standards, and it’s starting to make me feel like I can’t live freely in my own home. I am very A type and do appreciate organization so this is by no means that I am messy or dirty. 

Every little thing I do is scrutinized. For example, when I make coffee, he’s right behind me with cleaning supplies, even though I reassure him I’ll clean up later after I enjoy my cup. He won’t let me leave my shoes anywhere except a specific spot, and if I do, he gets upset. It’s honestly exhausting, and I just want to unwind after a long day. The bigger issue is that he constantly moves my stuff around into places he thinks are “appropriate.” I’ll leave my laptop or keys on the counter, thinking I’ll grab them in the morning at 5 am, but they’re always moved, and I can never find my things when I need them. This morning, I couldn’t find my laptop or keys, and I ended up being late to work because of it. Same thing with my morning meds, or my purse. I’m just so tired of it and we have had numerous conversations regarding leaving my personal items alone. What is wrong with me laying items out the night before for me to easily grab in the morning to maximize my sleep?!

I’ve tried explaining that I need a little space to relax, but he just keeps following me around and making snide comments like, “Why are there coffee grounds by the coffee maker?” or “You didn’t put your shoes in the right place.” It feels like I’m constantly walking on eggshells and I’m not allowed to just exist in my own home. I feel like I’m living with a parent rather than a partner. His standards of the kitchen being absolutely immaculate is exhausting. I don’t even cook at home anymore and get takeout everyday not to “ruin” the kitchen. I don’t feel like I’m living in my home but rather my parents. 

Additional context : I am forced to use the guest bathroom as opposed to the master bathroom because he would be upset if I left out hot tools to cool down. I don’t have enough room in there. ",12,1741361671.0,AITAH,46,0.83,False

Day 1 - I landed in Reykjavík, checked into my Air B&B and went to the grocery store. I shopped at Bonus for the week(I highly recommend the rye bread, Skyr, Icelandic malt drink and the licorice candy. I bought lots of pasta and tomato sauce as well). I rested for a bit and went to the Lava show at night followed by dinner at ""BrewDog""(loved the burger and the Icelandic beer options they had here, expensive but I ate in a fancy bar only for one night so it was worth it)

Day 2 - I made and packed my breakfast and lunch. I had booked a day tour with a small tour group, we went to Snæfellsnes peninsula. I came back to the city at night. 

Day 3 - Packed breakfast and lunch and went for another day tour to the Golden Circle and secret lagoon. Came back by 4:30 p.m. I explored the city a little bit, went inside the church, visited the harbour, the concert house and had a traditional Icelandic hotdog. 

Day 4 - Packed breakfast and lunch and went for another day tour to the South Coast. Did the glacier hike and waterfalls and came back to the city by 8 p.m. I had some traditional Icelandic soup for dinner from this place called ""Icelandic Street Food"", they offer free refills. 

Day 5 - I went out for breakfast to ""Braud and Co"" to try their cinnamon rolls and coffee. Packed my lunch and went for a half day Volcano hike tour. Came back to the city by 4 p.m and went to shop for some souvenirs. I highly recommend the Red Cross thrift store at the city centre, I bought a pair of Icelandic wool socks and gloves for a great price here. At night, I went for the northern lights sighting by bus, this was part of the package of the day tour. I saw the lights in all its glory! Came back to the city by 1:30 a.m 

Day 6 - Packed breakfast and lunch and went on a half day tour to Hvammsvik hot springs. I cannot recommend this place enough! Came back to the city at 4 p.m and went to the Iceland history museum. This is a cool museum if you have some time to spare. Walked around the city after that and then made some dinner(cup-o-noodles from the supermarket). Ended my last night on a ship tour looking for the northern lights. Didn't see any lights from the ship but the music and vibe was great. 

Day 7 - Took an early morning flight back home! 

Iceland, you are magical!

The apartment isn’t finished yet as I just moved but the coffee table is the same colour wood as the tv stand. I’ll also add more colour with plants, pictures on the wall and throws on the couch.

Looking online, it says that an 8oz serving of decaf coffee has 3-15mg of caffeine, which is small enough that it shouldn’t be a problem. Does this hold for moka pot coffee? Because a 6 cup moka technically holds 6 servings of coffee, does this mean it contains 3x6=15mg to 15x6=90mgs of caffeine? Anybody know the actual amount?",2,1741360580.0,mokapot,6,1.0,False
1j5qk8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j5qk8v/advice_needed_on_buying_an_espresso_machine_2000/,Advice Needed on Buying an Espresso Machine [2000€],"Hello everyone!

I'm looking for advice on buying an espresso machine that fits my needs. Here are some details about my preferences and past experiences:

**Location:** Europe  
**Preferred drink types:** Cappuccino, Espresso, Americano  
**Drink frequency:** 1-2 drinks at a time, 1-2 times per day  

**Previous Coffee Machines:**

1. **DELONGHI EC685:** Liked the size but didn't have a grinder at the time, so the coffee quality was lacking. Preparing cappuccinos was labor-intensive, which made me decide to move on.
2. **KRUPS EA89 Bean to Cup (Black Friday clearance):** It died unexpectedly, but I was glad it did. I enjoyed the one-touch cappuccino feature, but the taste was more like instant coffee.

**What I'm Looking For:**  
Here are my priorities for a new machine:

1. **Convenience and Ease of Use:** I want something that provides a balance between manual and automatic functions. I want to avoid the hassle of coffee dosing, grinding, tamping, leveling, milk frothing, and cleaning all at once.
2. **Reliability:** As BIFL as it could be.
3. **Minimal Cleaning:** I hated those milk tubes and nozzles that you could never thorougly clean.

**Options I'm Considering:**

* **Oracle Touch:** It's expensive and I've heard it can be slow to heat up. Is it overkill for my frequency of 1-2 drinks?
* **Oracle Jet:** Pricing is more moderate, People are saying is better than Barista but is it really better than a bambino in 1/4 of the price tag?
* **Barista Touch Impress:** The price is reasonable and it seems to do similar things as the Oracle Jet, but a click worse?

I’ve also seen recommendations for the **B. Bambino** or **Lelit Mara X** paired with a **DF64 Grinder**.  I do agree this would actually be the best options for value/money but this goes back to \*(coffee dosing, grinding, tampering, levelling and milk frothing, cleaning)\*. 

**Budget:** Max 2000 euros.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these options or any other recommendations that fit !  

Thank you!",2,1741360568.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1j5qjxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1j5qjxz/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_friend/,AITA for Being Uncomfortable with My Friend Talking to My Casual Ex?,"I'm a 28-year-old female, and I recently discovered that one of my closest friends, Nikki, a 31-year-old female, has been in contact with a guy I was casually seeing, Kevin, a 35-year-old male.

Nikki and I have been friends for years and are family friends. After my divorce two years ago—due to my ex-husband’s gambling and infidelity, especially during a tough time when I gave birth to our child at 29 weeks—I wasn't interested in dating.

One day, while having coffee, I met Kevin. We hit it off, he found me on social media, and we started talking with the understanding that it was casual. He always insisted that I not mention him to anyone, which I found strange. I only discussed him with Nikki once and never revealed his name.

A few months later, I found out that Kevin had reached out to Nikki and they were talking. I hadn’t introduced them, nor had I ever mentioned either of them to the other. One day, he called me, angry and accusing me of badmouthing him, which wasn’t true since I had never revealed his name and had only mentioned him to Nikki once. After that confrontation, I blocked Kevin on all platforms.

After the confrontation with Kevin, I reached out to Nikki since she was the only person who came to mind—I had never mentioned him to anyone else, especially not his identity when I mentioned him once. When I spoke with Nikki, I explained what happened, and she confirmed that she was indeed talking to Kevin and agreed that he had overreacted. She asked if there was anything between us. I wanted to share more about him in person, but she said she was busy and tired. She then asked if I was okay her talking to him. I felt it would be better to discuss it face-to-face, but I didn’t directly answer her question.

After a few days of trying to reach out to Nikki, she responded with blunt messages and eventually removed me from all social media.

# 29 M4F #DC MD VA - You are the epitome of one man’s loving wife/gf being another man’s pathetic mindless set of holes

>That’s what makes it extremely hot to me. The dichotomy between the sweet loving wife/gf act that you put on for your man vs the depraved mindless cock hungry set of holes you are for other men.

>Having your man treat you like a queen all while crawling on all fours like the obedient good girl you are for other men. Letting other men treat you like a literal fuck object with no self respect. Being spit on, slapped, groped, and fucked wherever and whenever. If your man saw, he wouldn’t even recognize the pathetic begging fuck object that is supposed to be his woman. Just a mindless set of wet holes.

>Message me if this is you or if you strive to be what I just described

Starting off with a bang this week! Assuming this poster has a significant other, how pleased do you think they'd be to find this?

# 40 [M4F] #London - Some say I’m wanted by the CIA and that I sleep upside down like a Bat!

>Hey there! I'm a 40-year-old guy from Bore-hamwood, UK who believes life is too short for dull moments. With a dash of wit and a sprinkle of charm, I’m looking to add a bit of excitement to my routine. While I appreciate the comfort of my current marriage, I find myself craving some mutual fun and connection outside of the everyday grind. If you’re a lady (perhaps in a similar situation) who enjoys laughter, adventure, and a bit of spontaneity, let’s chat and see where our shared interests might take us!

I don't get it. What am I missing?

# 36 [M4F] #NYC - Have you not been eaten out in awhile?

>A bit about me: 36, Asian, 5'7, 180 lbs, married dad.

>I'm sure a lot of people say this, but I truly love eating pussy. While there are other parts of sex and kink that excite me more, I can go hang between your thighs for awhile and be very, very content. I've had some pretty great reviews including ""best orgasm I've ever had"", ""top 3 muff dives"", and ""damn, how'd you do that with your fingers?"".

>While this post is NSFW focused, I'm also looking for more outside of my marriage too so I'd love it if we connected beyond that. Maybe for lunches or coffee during the week together? Or a ""business trip"" we end up taking together? Let's talk it out and see what works best.

Now I'm curious what talents and skills the #1 and #2 (assuming they're separate people) muff divers have.

# 37 [M4F] #Boston - Get wrecked

>In a dead bedroom sitch and need someone discreet and local to rail. Open to a lot but mostly just want both of us to have a hell of a time. I'm tall, endowed, and have a dad bod and attracted to all kinds

Sigh.

# 36 [M4F] #Boston - Extended play

>Want someone nearby to just sit and play with for a while. My kink is mutual pleasure so just wanna make each other writhe

Hmm...what is actually *in* that dirty water? This one wasn't especially egregious, but go look for it because you'll love the user name :)

# 39 [M4A] #Sanford - Thick bbc full of cum

>Only looking to meet IN Sanford. Either you host or car play (I know quite a few spots we can play). I'm clean and ddf, so you must be as well. Only interested in meeting with females, couples, & ftm. Not looking to play games, looking to meet asap.

Which do we think is worse - ""not looking to play games"" or ""not looking to change my situation""?

# 45 [M4F] - #dc, #nova, #va, #md, #dmv - Things might be tight in the DMV but so are my hands.

>Hi there, hopefully I can articulate myself well enough for you to take a chance on me. Where do I start, I am married, two kids with a passion for my job. I know that sounds odd but I do actually like my job (maybe more on some days). I am here looking for someone to who is interested in something more than just physical. I want someone I can talk to regularly about anything and want them to feel that comfort. Obviously this takes time and no one can build that quickly.

>Outside of my job I love sports, working out and yoga. I listen to music quite often because I workout so much so if you are a music lover happy to chat about that. I also enjoy tv/movies. I would love to tell you I enjoy reading but I never can get myself into reading. I will dive deep into “why” when I look at certain series or movies. I am a sarcastic person who probably puts his foot in his mouth more times than I would like to count.

>I am looking for a lady who enjoys things. Meaning it doesn’t need to be things I enjoy but someone with passion for things. I love to learn about what others like. Being very cliche here but I am looking for someone who is funny and smart. Someone who loves to chat.

>Sexually I am more dominant. I enjoy the chase and teasing as much as the physical act. I am a big believer in turning a woman’s mind on first.

>So that me or as much as I can put here without it being crazy long. I hope to hear from you. Thanks for reading.

Is...is ""tight hands"" a thing?

# 34 [M4F] #Nassau #NY - Married Dad Seeks Throat Goat

>Alright, I’m just gonna say it—it’s been way too long since I’ve had a BJ, and I miss it. My wife? She’s officially retired from that department, and let’s just say, I’m feeling the drought. So, I’m on the hunt for a generous, discreet, and talented throat goat who loves to give and expects nothing more than a fun, stress-free time in return. No drama, no strings, just good vibes and great service.

>A few possible scenarios we can make happen:

>💻 Stopping by while I’m “working” (turns out Zoom calls are easy to mute)

>🚗 A quick rendezvous in the car, because let’s be real, that thrill never gets old

>🏨 Hotel meetup if you prefer something more comfortable

>🍔 Grabbing some fast food after, because let’s be honest, we’ll both be hungry

>What I bring to the table:

>A dad bod that’s been expertly maintained through years of avoiding cardio

>A deep and genuine appreciation for BJs—seriously, they’re my favorite thing in the world

>A laid-back attitude, full discretion, and zero pressure or expectations

>Feedback (if you're looking for that) and confirmation that you are good at your craft

>What I’m looking for:

>Someone who loves to give and takes pride in her work

>A fun, chill, and discreet partner who understands the no drama, no complications vibe

>I’d prefer something ongoing and open to specific scenarios like cock warming, ball worship, prostate milking, etc.

>I realize this is a specific thing, so some details about my member — he’s circumcised, thick, clean shaven, and average length.

# 25 [M4F]- #Texas Hung chubby dude looking for a long term sext partner, preferably someone older and chubby but wouldn't discriminate.

>Hung Brown daddy here, check my profile out and you'd realize why I say so. I like sexting and dirty talk throughout the day and wouldn't mind something like that with banter everyday.

>I like taking control and making my woman cum. So check my profile out, if you think I'm your cup of tea. I'd love to chat.

It's ironic, if you know your history, but the original title for ""Zoot Suit Riot"" *was ""*Hung Brown Daddy"" (Daddy!)

# 60 [M4F] #SantaClarita - Experienced Man Looking for F 18+

>If you crave attention and pleasure from an experienced man, and are looking for intense erotic excitement, you can enjoy the sensations you dream of .

>Many women find that the traditional good girl role restricts their freedom and then find incredible pleasure when they lose their inhibitions.

>We will set boundaries and a safe word, discuss your desires and fantasies, and then mutually explore your limits.

>Discreet or anonymous meetings ok.

 Not only is it good for gaining credibility, building a loyal audience, and promoting your offers free of charge... but ALSO, if you happen to run ads you can test the ad creative FIRST as free organic videos and then boost ONLY THE POSTS THAT GOT GREAT ENGAGEMENT FROM THE AUDIENCE. This is actually something that Gary Vee encourages—and he's one of the top people in marketing and advertising today. 

Sorry for the caps, I don't have the option to underscore here on reddit. 

I'll say it simply, the first game changer is feeling very comfortable on front of the camera. 
Right now, the best way to grow on social media is through short form video: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts... 
Because these are the types of posts that are promote to new people—outside of your current audience. 

Livestreaming on TikTok specifically is an absolutely plus, but I'll get to that another time since most people don't like to do it and you do need 1000 followers to be able to start. 

Now, on social, you shouldn't just show your products. You must also have a personal brand attached to what you sell. People love stories. 

Think about it like this: if Walmart has the same price and quality, and is at the same distance from you as a small business who's owner is called Bennie and you both share love for the same sports team, who would you rather buy from? 
What if you need some tomato sauce and Walmart has it, but you actually know that Bennie grows his own cherry tomatoes and has a whole curated process for letting the tomatoes dry and enrich their taste and he also has two lovely daughters who love him back and a son who's really good at making pasta on Sundays to go with the sauce... who do you buy from? Walmart? Or Bennie? 🍅🍅🍅

The more you show up as you are, the easier it is to choose you among all the other options. 

So here are some tips to grab that opportunity—which happens to be FREE and at your fingertips— and make the most out of it. 

First, HOOKS. 

Everyone talks about ""hooks, hooks, hooks"" but what even is that? It's basically ""hooking"" people in during the first 2-3 seconds of the video. 

There are multiple techniques such as: saying a shocking statement at the beginning, holding an object that's out-of-place in your hand while you talk, having something visually out-of-place (some women for example record with eye jelly masks on) or film yourself while doing an action that isn't completed until the end of the video (some people used to record storytimes while putting makeup on) 

But what it basically means is taking the viewer from one place to another. 

So you take them from a state of mind of being entertained, watching other content (place 1) to getting serious and finally cutting off someone who's toxic from their lives (place 2). But you need to make WHAT they're about to watch very clear in the beginning. 

Or you take them to another place visually, starting at one location in your house and quickly switching to another room before second 3. 

Or you create visuals that have nothing to do with what they just saw on another video, making your post really immersive, being so well spoken that each word leads to the next and they don't stop listening. 

Now, to do this correctly, you have to be very comfortable with being on camera. 

This may sound woo woo to some people but at this point you can't deny that people HAVE energy and they exude their intentions, emotions, and thoughts. 

If you're not paying attention to yourself, why would you expect the viewers who don't even know you to pay attention? 

On social media, there's no time for doubt or insecurity. These two will slow down your speaking pace (making you harder to watch), confuse your words or make you say too many filler statements, get you far from making a point, make you so worried not to offend anyone that you end up loosing touch with your essence. 

This is a work in progress though, it can take as long as it needs to. But it's important that you make sure it IS still a work in progress. 

Now, here are some of the techniques that I recommend to the people we make content for at my agency: 

• IMAGINING YOUR FAVORITE CLIENT/FRIEND
For a lot of people, it's super hard to speak to the camera. But if you imagine you're looking into the eyes of someone who already likes you, listens to you, and believes in you, it's much easier. 

• PLAYING A MENTAL GAME OF READING RIGHT BEFORE FILMING 
There are apps you can use on your phone, that will make you do mental games and tire your mind out. Normally you'd hear someone tell you to stay focused. But if you're a person who's self concious and you get nervous in front of the camera, this might not be the best time to be aware of these thoughts, which brings me to my next point 

• GET IN A GREAT MENTAL STATE 
There has to be an activity that you really enjoy, and that makes you feel badass. One if my clients mentioned that he felt powerful after playing tennis. So I told him to try scheduling filming time right after tennis. The next time I spoke to him he let me know that it worked amazing, he was super confident and he recorded twice as much as he usually does. 
So you need to find your thing. Maybe it's listening to music, maybe it's watching a scene from a movie, maybe it's calling someone you love, maybe it's getting a coffee and drinking it while you listen the soundtrack of James Bond... whatever it is, be IN IT. This is not the time to be humble. GET COCKY!!! LET IT BE FUN!!! 

• PLAN AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
The more you script, plan, rehearse, the less natural the words are going to come out. If people want to listen to a robot, they can ask chatgpt. Your work here is to try to be as authentic as possible. Which can get tricky once the camera is on. 

But the more YOU you are, the more people will feel like they can trust you. 
And that is important for your business. 

• THERE'S NO NEED TO ADD ANYTHING ON TOP
You are the best speaker when you're talking to someone you know and trust. Next time you have a conversation with a person like this, notice how much you're thinking about what you're about to say. Probably not at all. The words just come out naturally and you might even get a reaction from the other person, like a laugh, concern.... ATTENTION. 
That's because you're somewhat close to the state of flow. Replicate that while you film don't think, just be. 

• TRY RETAINING PAUSES UNTIL THE SENTENCE IS DONE. 
And once it's done, edit the pause out. Pauses are an opportunity for the viewer to scroll away. Silence can work great in public speaking, where you have the spotlight on you and the audience is sat in a closed room where it's socially unacceptable to leave. There's not much of a choice there. 
But in social media, there are literally millions of options.


Speaking of editing, you also have to keep it interesting. Ideally you'd create all visual stimuli in the filming phase, but if your footage is still and it's just you talking you can play with subtitle placement and size throughout the video, add zooms in/out, change the framing, maybe even remove the background and add an article behind you as you make yourself small so people can read something else (related to what you're saying) as they listen to you... there's so much more. 

And lastly: 

DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHOW EVEN THE BAD DAYS OR THE BAD SIDES OF YOU. 
I understand there might be family or friends or acquaintances you might not want to be oversharing to, but this is so much bigger than that. If you have a vision, if you truly want to change the world or at least your life, you have to make the choice to go all in. 
The more you you are, the more people will trust you. 
With the rise of technology and so many new ""robots"" getting you information, do you really think people will gravitate towards a picture-perfect, curated, almost corporate image that never seems to do wrong and knows absolutely everything about everything? 
No!!! Once you admit your faults you're reliable. Even the little ones like ""this is my day, I hate working out and I've been eating poorly but I'm working on it""

Once you say ""hey I struggle too"", people will trust your ""but I can solve THIS for you"" 

Please don't waste this opportunity. It's right here. Right where you're reading right now.

Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle for his weekly commute via private jet. A greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): “At Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet. Across our company, we are testing and scaling innovative solutions to support partners, farmers and communities in the face of global climate change.”

 [“Starbucks touts ](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/starbucks-new-ceo-has-a-big-footprint-commutes-private-jet-nevermind-climate-goals-3df1aa5f)its “decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change”, and claims achieving this goal “takes all of us”, it nonetheless has allowed the new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to commute weekly from his California home via private jet”. [“Estimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), “indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That’s roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.” Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote **against**](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. But considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company; let alone the environment. ",29,1741360172.0,economicCollapse,5,1.0,False

 Not only is it good for gaining credibility, building a loyal audience, and promoting your offers free of charge... but ALSO, if you happen to run ads you can test the ad creative FIRST as free organic videos and then boost ONLY THE POSTS THAT GOT GREAT ENGAGEMENT FROM THE AUDIENCE. This is actually something that Gary Vee encourages—and he's one of the top people in marketing and advertising today. 

Sorry for the caps, I don't have the option to underscore here on reddit. 

I'll say it simply, the first game changer is feeling very comfortable on front of the camera. 
Right now, the best way to grow on social media is through short form video: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts... 
Because these are the types of posts that are promote to new people—outside of your current audience. 

Livestreaming on TikTok specifically is an absolutely plus, but I'll get to that another time since most people don't like to do it and you do need 1000 followers to be able to start.

As a teen through my early 20s I used to drink coffee like water and it didn’t really effect me. I just liked it. The past maybe 5 years though, I have been super intolerant to it. Jittery, headaches. In my mind I just attributed it to aftermath of a car accident I was in, I thought maybe the concussion just scrambled my nerves around lol. But other than the car accident, these 5 years have had a wide array of stressful events happen ranging from covid, moving (I have moved 9 times in this time span lol), family members passing, losing and starting new jobs, losing and gaining friendships, getting in and out of an (abusive) engagement. So like a lot has been happening! 

During this time I guess I was just super sensitive, I was always living either with family, roommates, or my ex fiancé so I always felt really on edge. At the end of last year I finally got out of my relationship and was able to move out on my own. I tried drinking a cup of regular coffee and felt fine! Its so bizarre!

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\

For more context, I've had POTS symptoms, textbook, for a good while now. I was feeling really bad one night and hoping someone would check up on me, my heart wouldn't stop racing. She rushed into my room, I was actually relieved. She said she was watching a video (some holistic dr she likes) that was talking about vitamin d overdose and she was sure I had it. Symptoms are slightly similar. So we rushed to the ER. The dr cocks his head to the side and goes ""it's almost impossible to overdose on vitamin d, especially in that quantity. It could be POTS"". We go home, and she continues to treat me for vit D overdose because ""the dr was wrong"". My vitamin D ends up being perfectly fine. Then she starts believing it's POTS but scours for the root cause. Mold Exposure? Checked that, likely not. It's the caffeine in coffee that affects me, not the mycotoxins. We get an air purifier for my room just in case. We start treating my condition like it's POTS. Salt, water, Liquid IV, a balance of rest/activity. It's going swimmingly, (ofc w some good and some bad days, that's how it goes with chronic illness). We go to a dr's appt. The dr says it's POTS convincingly (she's very knowledgeable in that area). We go home, and my mom is watching holistic dr's again. 

All of a sudden, she once again comes inti my room looking for my last lab results. My B1 must be too low. I must have a thiamine deficiency. (which is beriberi??) Because of all the other times she had ""convincing"" leads, i take it, as i always have everything, with a grain of salt and look into it myself. Not likely. Very serious and very rare. Wet brain, anorexia, and a plethora of symptoms I dont have. I try to talk to her about it, and all of a sudden she starts yelling at me that it seems I don't wanna get better. ""I don't know if it's an excuse to stay locked up in your room, or if it's for attention, but it's not cute, it looks ugly, and your attitude stinks. You complain all day about 'oh, my heart this, oh i feel sick', and it's sickening."" I would tell her symptoms throughout the day so A) we can document it and B) she would make me do something when im feeling ill because she'd go ""well i didnt hear you complaining earlier, all of a sudden i send you to do something and you feel sick?"". And I would obly bring it up when, yes you guessed it, I felt at my worst like I was gonna pass out or throw up. Some days are better than others, so she gets annoyed at me on my bad days because I tell her I cant do much. I also told her I was expressing my concern because I don't want beriberi. It seems very scary. She goes ""oh, so get the less serious disease and still complain all day then. You don't think I'm worried for you? I'm researching left and right. I ask DOCTORS [we have a doctor friend] if it's a good lead to look into before I ask you, because you always go 'no, i dont think so, no i researched' and it makes me not even wanna talk to you. You never wanna look into the things I say, you just wanna stay sick. You're know-it-all behavior is ungrateful and rude"". And I'm just very upset and confused?? I look into the things she says, I try them, and they simply dont work other than salt, water, and Liquid IV. She says she's concerned, but then says I'm being dramatic, lacking faith, and doing extra for attention. And then she empathizes with me for the rest of the day, telling me I should go out with friends. 
I don't want her research, I just need her to understand I need to rest. I can't do the things I used to do. Even when I cleaned the whole house top to bottom every day, there was some sort of complaint. ""Well you should cook more"". I really can't exhert my energy anymore, it's killing me. Anyway, what does this mean?? Why did she say this, why is she acting like this? Sorry this is so long.",2,1741359540.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

After getting our children to their school/daycare for the day I went to our local coffee shop to pick us up each a cup, I figured it can either be seen as a show of care or a peace offering. Once I got home he was sitting at our island doom scrolling through TikTok (I think we’ve all been there), I decided standing across from him would be a bit of a better choice so I gave us our respective cups and asked if I could get his attention for a conversation. Well what I hoped would be productive turned unproductive quickly as he sighed with an eye roll and turned off his phone, I started by asking the big question of if he wanted anymore children, I even suggested he doesn’t think about what I said on the subject and just tell me his feelings about more children; with that he answered a firm no and told me as he said before a third child is and will always be off the table. I then asked him if he had any fears or concerns about surgeries/medical procedures, he said no to this question as well. So I asked if he understood the procedure and what it entailed and he said yes he does which is why he doesn’t want me to get it done, in his words I wouldn’t be a woman if I got any part of my reproductive organs (what makes me a woman) removed and he refuses to allow me down that path. I then followed up by asking about his getting a vasectomy and he said it’s pretty much the same thing for men and he won’t let anyone take away if manhood. The final question I managed to ask was did he just expect me to be on birth control forever and this man looked me in m face and said it’s worked so well for me already why change things up, guys as I stated in my previous post I am miserable and in debilitating pain with birth control. At the end of this I just grabbed my coffee and went sit on our porch just trying to wrap my head around the conversation while he sit in the house acting like nothing is wrong and we’re just having a normal day off together…..",421,1741359240.0,AITAH,363,0.96,False

Yesterday I had a doctor’s appointment to check my liver and surrounding organs for damage. We received great news and there is no scarring and just mild Fatty liver. (Level 0). Not that this next bit of fact is an excuse but the doc said 1 in 3 people have it in America! That’s a crazy statistic. And also found since an ultrasound back in October it has improved exponentially and I’m moving in the right direction. 

However, this good news prompted my lizard brain to want to get a drink. We decided to catch brunch at a local place I’d used to get pitchers of mimosas at. I asked my spouse. Should I get a drink. And with no judgement or strange tone they said. “Hmmm. I think not today. Maybe tomorrow.” And that was it. 

I got coffee instead and didn’t order a drink. And now I am so happy and glad I didn’t. I really appreciate their support and the way I don’t feel judged for my decisions.

During the day:

Go to Forest Park. Designed by Sir Frederick Olmsted, FP was his testing grounds before immediately afterwards designing Central Park in Manhattan. The backstory of the park’s creation is the inspiration for How The Grinch Stole Christmas.

Go to the Urban Food Brood. A wicked cool collective, this indoor food court has great food and drinks with a good vibe. Coffee is roasted onsite by Monsoon, make sure you pick up some beans to go. 

Go to the Springfield Museums. One ticket gets you into all museums on the campus, and this is actually walking distance from the venue. 

Pre-show:

Parking is a nightmare downtown, with one of the main parking garages closed and under construction. Get downtown early (meters are free on the weekend if you can find one) and hit up one of the spots listed below. Park in the MGM garage (free) or 91 garage (paid but closer).

Nosh downtown is opening special for a pre-show party. The owner and staff are all big jam band fans, and the restaurant is only a block from the venue. This is where I’ll be!

Smith’s/Theodore’s is always a good time, but is a bit further from the venue (still walking distance though). I would save this for post-show when they’ll have live music. 

Panjabi has great Indian food. Ignore Red Rose, it’s a tourist trap and you won’t be able to get a table. 

Post-show:

As mentioned above, Theo’s has live blues and Smith’s has pool and craft beer. 

Dewey’s is awesome and has live jazz. 

MGM has gambling if you’re into that sort of thing.

There have been any number of  “MAFS stars” and  other reality tv shows whose “stars’ have become household names.  

Many of them have backstories that  truth be told, Freud could have a dedicated a textbook to how it impacted them in later life.  

*So what makes Jamie so different from the rest that she is so blatantly stupid and has no problem putting her stupidity on display. Why does* she *seem* to *have no moral compass?*

Certainly there are other “stars” with difficult upbringing that have succeeded. I admittedly am not a follower of any of them, so perhaps it is simply ignorance on my part, and maybe she isn’t the ""Queen of reality tv stupidity”.  Is it that the others have spouses or partners that  ground them a bit, so to speak?  Is it that she is in over her head?  Is it as simple as the desperation for fame? 

Wondering what your thoughts are and if I am just missing another “star of stupidity”.  Other than Ruby of course, and I know nothing of her back story.

I give proper credit to the wrong guys teaching me all the right lessons.

I'm ***S L O W L Y*** learning to tell the difference between when a guy truly wants to build a connection with me versus just wanting to use me for attention and giving him an ego boost. These characteristics may be elementary, but they are useful in helping me learn to further avoid them in the future.

1. ***The focus is always on the future and not on the present***. The substance of our conversation is always focused on the future, building this great and wonderful life together. Future plans are made, and he paints this beautiful picture of how awesome our relationship will be. However, he is distant and unavailable in the present. The reason why he's wanting to focus so much on the future is to distract me from the fact that he's not there for me in the present.
2. ***He keeps telling me that he's a good/nice guy, I can trust him, and that he's not like any of the guys from my past.*** It's interesting how he says these things with his words, while his actions tell a different story. He's not a good/nice guy if he doesn't call when he said he would. I can't trust him because he avoids being real and upfront with me, while being vague when dodging my questions about him. He is like all the other guys from my past, coming in hot with all talk but no action. My intuition screams at me if I find myself constantly challenging anything he says.
3. ***His compliments of ""You're so great"" and ""You're so awesome"" are actually NOT about me but about him***. When he tells me such things, it's not because he truly knows me that well. It's because he is using those nice sounding words to keep me hooked on him, so I'll keep giving him my attention and boosting his fragile ego. As I keep giving him my attention, he goes on bragging about himself and promising a picture-perfect future while being unavailable and having no interest in building a mutual connection.
4. ***He is very specific about all the plans and goals he has for his future while making contradictory choices in the present***. He boasts about wanting to get fit like a MMA fighter while he chooses to munch on Doritos and slay his thirst with Mountain Dew. He talks about going back to school to become an architect yet is unconcerned that his FAFSA application isn't filled out and sent before the deadline as he plays his video games. He wants me to know that he will become a manager of McDonald's and perhaps his own franchise, yet will pull a no-call, no-show and laughing that he can get away with it because he has not been fired yet.
5. ***He was such a sweetheart with his ex(es) yet is content to be mediocre with me***. He would regale me with stories of how he would make breakfast on leisurely weekend mornings and bring them coffee in bed, making all this money to treat them with lovely vacations and gifts, always being there for them as a faithful and loyal partner, and how much he truly loved them. But with me, he expected me to be content with settling for much less from him.
6. ***Excessive and frustrating communication issues very early on.*** As I'm starting to understand that building a connection can be both fun as well as requiring effort, communication attempts with a guy who just wants to use me for attention will be excessive and frustrating. A big one is that he doesn't call when he said he would. Petty arguments originate from text messages. There is usually something that ""suddenly"" comes up when he's promised to set time aside for us to talk. I'm the one asking all the specific questions about him and open-ended questions while he gives me one-word or closed-ended answers. Arguments never get settled. He has no interest in solving the root of the issue. A trademark is his inevitable unavailability and/or ghosting. 

While being aware of such characteristics is necessary, the actual part of my healing comes in by asking some very hard questions about myself.

* *What made such men attractive to me? What was it about them that drew me to them?*
* *What was it that I was trying to accomplish by involving myself with any of them?*
* *What gave me the idea that involving myself with these kinds of men would result in a healthy and successful relationship?*
* *Why did I keep making the mistake of expecting something different to happen each time?*
* *Do I really understand what a healthy relationship looks like?*

I'll revisit these questions when I have more time, perhaps later on tonight, for serious introspection.

A whole conversation played out in my mind, what I would say to you, standing next to my partner now, should I run across you. In my usual self depreciating style, I laughed it off that you probably never thought you'd have to see my face again and wouldn't notice me in a half empty room. Or you'd hardly recognize me because I am fatter than the last time you commented on me having gained weight. I assured myself that I would probably just smile and give a pathetic half wave and let you ignore me. But I couldn't stop my thought from playing out past my initial dismissal ... what if you were right there, in a line in front of me waiting to be seated at a restaurant, or your groceries were half bagged when we pulled our cart up? Would I get to introduce you to my girlfriend now as someone I am a lot better off for having known and someone who was much worse off for having known me? I told her about you so I'd watch her make the connection in real time and she'd squeeze my hand for support. Yup babe, this is that guy. The guy who I treated so badly it made me question what type of person I even wanted to be to others. You would loathe my perspective surely scoff at me trying to say anything positive or at all. You would hate being a catalyst for me getting my act together. Why couldn't I have done that when you were right there in front of me willing to care? You found my self hatred and apologies pathetic when we did have our last walk. I would like to think it was because I had just started intensive therapy, was still trying to maintain relationships with people I have since cut from my life and generally directed my self loathing back at the world in daggers laced with my self esteem problems even if I had put down the double barrel of self sabotage. I could not accept your caring about me back then. And I accepted that you hated me and wanted you close even knowing that like somehow it meant you really saw me. You wouldn't offer it back up now. You'd look at your shoes if you heard my voice or suddenly get a phone call. So I know better than to try to reach out. Yet, I still gave your name a search to see where you've landed. And I had to smile, because you are still just so beyond out of my league. So a part of me will always leave the lantern on, that maybe you wouldn't curse under your breath at my face in your peripheral. Maybe you'd have to turn and confirm your suspicions. You'd laugh at me for dating a therapist but you'd walk away liking her for some reason as most people do and you'd be happy for me and maybe out of morbid curiosity you'd be the one to ask if we could grab a coffee so you could brag about your research and your life. I had to snap out of even thinking about you as I pulled into the parking lot, having reached my destination. Here's to hoping you did too.  ",2,1741358834.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I’ve just gone through a lot of changes recently. I had to deal with a move to a new house, and at the same time, I started a new job. Yesterday was my first day, and to top it all off, I was also sick with the flu for about a week during the move. So, there's been a lot happening all at once, and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed.

Despite the fact that my new job pays more, I have this strange sense of uncertainty and doubt. I don’t feel completely unhappy, but I also don’t feel truly happy or excited. When I first started, I was excited about the new job, but now I just feel off about it. It's not that I dislike the job; it’s more of a feeling of disconnection.

The truth is, I miss the feeling of being at home in my old job. It’s not that I miss the actual work, but I felt so comfortable and confident there because I knew exactly what I was doing. In this new job, I feel like a rookie, even though I have a lot of experience. I know I can do it, but I feel out of place in this new role. On top of that, I’m getting a vibe that the people around me aren’t that friendly. Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels like something isn’t quite right.

It reminds me of a time when I worked at a small coffee shop. I did everything there, and eventually, I got fed up. I left, and a month later, the shop shut down. That experience confirmed that I was right — the others weren’t doing their part. Even the owner reached out to me afterward, asking me to come back and saying he’d fix things, but by then, I was done. I’d already been dealing with it for months.

I don’t know why, but now I’m already applying for other jobs. Maybe it’s just a phase, but I’m not sure. I’ve been feeling this uncertainty and doubt a lot lately, and I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking it.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of feeling when transitioning to a new job? How did you cope with the adjustment? I'd love to hear some opinions.

Just completed a 96-hour fast and 3 eating days following. No unexpected issues. Felt I could have readily gone longer, but had an appointment in the city so went shopping and picked up perishables. Will save it for next time. Hunger was 24 hours a day before switching to OMAD. After OMAD, I would get a 2 to 4 hour window each day of not being hungry. In extended fast, hunger back to 24 hours a day, but didn't seem any worse than usual. Frequent thoughts of food. Watched a lot of youtube vids about fasting. Felt particularly bloated or something on evening of third no-food day. Took a gas-X; that fixed it, or it passed naturally right away. Two days of normal bowel movements, then two days of nearly nothing, then a small wet bowel movement inside the long first eating window. Broke the fast with 1 tbsp red wine vinegar (with mother), followed by a vegetable and beef soup with added vegetables, then more soup, then the rest of the soup, then fish. Post fast 3 days caloric intake average at maintenance. 64yo, Euro-genetic, male, 5'9"". Goal weight 150. Morning weigh-ins of 173.9, 171.5, 171.3, 169.8, 171.4, 171.7, 170.7. 

Fast preceded by 3 days of 1300 calories about 30carb/25/45fat macros. 4 to 5 quarts of water per day throughout plus 10 oz or 20 oz of coffee, which are my usuals.

Average daily electrolytes on no-food days were 1800 mg sodium, 1020 mg potassium and 130 mg magnesium. I'm on a low-sodium low-potassium medical diet normally for blood pressure. Exercise was high-intensity cardio on the first no-food day. Then my cardio performance was terrible and I reduced its volume and substituted more walking. Resistance training was every other day with lower volume. Blood pressure readings seemed to move a bit lower during the fast.

1j5pjnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/notsoshortstories/comments/1j5pjnz/i_met_my_online_boyfriend_for_the_first_time_in/,I met my online boyfriend for the first time in NYC.,"It was December 26, 2025. 

The day I met my boyfriend for the first time.

I, along with my family and my mom’s co-worker, went to NYC for the holidays, just for a few days. Everyone was excited to go, but I believe no one was more excited than me. On December 26, we had planned to visit Times Square, New York. The plan was to go to the square first, then Bryant park. There was a Christmas flea market that my mother wanted to visit there. Unbeknownst to my family, I had my own plans.
	
My own plans to see him.

I (17 F) met Daniel (16 M) through a game, and we have been online dating since then. I know that there is a lot of stigma around online dating, and I know what works for me may not work for you. (Long distance is NOT for the weak.) Despite the distance, he was everything I was looking for in a boyfriend, even a potential husband. He was sweet, handsome, funny, smart, understanding, and has a knack for creating knives (which is so damn cool). I love how he pursues me to such a degree which I have never seen in boys in this generation. Daniel has been my support and my rock, protecting me and helping me through the darkest moments of my life; for that, I will forever be grateful to him. Although our relationship is mostly online, our love for eachother is much more than digital.

Daniel and I decided weeks before winter break that we would meet in Times Square. He had a reasonable excuse to go; he was to spend Hanukkah with his sister in Crown Heights. This was his perfect escape from the suspicious prying from his mother. He was thankfully able to avoid the “where are you going?” and “why there?” questions with this excuse. The idea at first only seemed like a silly dream, something unlikely to occur. We had only been dating for about four months, but we really wanted to meet in person. When this opportunity arrived, we jumped on it as soon as we could, but we readied our hearts were ready for failure. The likelihood of this happening was unlikely, especially with so much travel involved, and both of us being minors limits what we can and can't do.

It was the morning of the 26th. My eyes flew open, and I could feel my heart palpitating hard in my chest. I had barely slept the night prior, but it didn't bother me. I was finally going to meet my boyfriend for the first time. I got up from my hotel bed, heart pounding. “Ok. I need to calm down.” I got up with such enthusiasm, one could believe I had been awake for hours, in contrast to my severe lack of sleep. I nearly tripped over myself as I hurriedly walked over to my clothes that I had laid out on a chair in front of a little coffee table the night before. I grabbed my clothing and stumbled towards the bathroom. I opened the door, careful not to make any noise, as my family and I were sharing a room. I sighed in relief as I realized I didn't wake anyone up. Looking at my bed-head disaster in the mirror, I decided to shower so that I could get my hair curly and presentable for today. As I showered, I prayed to God that my hair would dry right so that my hair could actually look good for today. It was such an important day. I really wanted to look my best for Daniel. A twinge of anxiety gnawed at me as I worried over what he would think of me.”No matter,” I thought to myself. After I finished showering, I did my makeup to the best of my ability- just like all the times I have practiced before. As I came out of the bathroom, dressed and clean, my family was up and ready to head down toward the lobby for breakfast. 

We left the hotel a few hours later for Zoe’s house. Zoe was one of my mom’s co-workers that happened to live in Rhode Island (where we were staying). She was visiting her folks. Zoe picked us up in her car to take us to her childhood home. As we loaded onto her car, I was a little bit restless because I told Daniel that I would be in Time Square by noon, and it was 10am. He had texted me that he was already on his way to Times Square. “Small detour. We will be late- Lunch at a friend’s.” He was understanding and told me that he would wait as long as it took, and also because he had to figure out the subway system. The drive to Zoe’s house was beautiful; she drove us around and gave us a tour of her small town. The houses were beautiful- mansions probably worth millions. The trees- although dead- looked beautiful in their leafless slumber as they loomed over us like sleeping giants. The whole ride I looked out the car window, trying to imagine what the moment would be like once I finally met my boyfriend in person. My heart was fluttering with nervousness at the thought of kissing him. How was I supposed to do that? I’ve never had my first kiss! I shook the thought away as we pulled into the parking lot to Zoe’s house. I was impressed that it used to be an old church- The inside was more impressive than the outside, as the open space was one I’ve never seen in a house before. We met her parents. Kind people. They ordered pizza for lunch, and served us several snacks. We sat at a long wooden dining table in the center of the large space. The whole place was very elegant. Even though the hospitality was great, I felt myself growing more and more restless. I found myself checking my phone over and over again as the minutes turned into hours. Time felt like an eternity passing by. I was just so impatient to see Daniel. The fact that I knew he was literally only a train ride away from me in contrast to the usual 18 hour drive made my excitement rise. A wave of impatient and restless emotions swelled in my chest. It was already noon, and I knew that the train ride was going to take about 40 minutes. I felt a prickling sensation of annoyance at the thought, and in response, I started to bounce my leg and fidget in my chair. My brother noticed my anxious state, and shot me a glare that said “calm down.” I rolled my eyes at him as I took the hint.

My brother, Julian (18M) found out about Daniel and I on December 1st. I tried to keep my relationship with Daniel a secret, because my family is strongly against communicating with strangers via online, especially having a relationship with one. My brother was pissed at first, but then he got used to it, as he was also online friends with Daniel before he found out we were dating. My brother promised me that he wouldn't say anything, and honestly having him know was probably the best thing to happen. He has helped me not blow my cover in front of my folks. I talk alot, and rather loud too; all thanks to my good ol’ ADHD. It’s hard to manage my natural tendencies alone, so having Julian to me in check has saved me many times. No matter how many times he said he wouldn't lie for me, he always did.

We left Zoe’s house at around 1pm. 

Finally.

I stood at the open-air station for our train to arrive. The icey winter wind whipped at my face, and cold gripped every limb on my body, but I didn't care. I was almost unaware that I was shivering, as the adrenaline was kicking in. This was it. 

We got on the train as it came to a full stop in front of us. As soon a s the doors opened, A rush of warm air surged from the small car. The atmosphere was warmer as I stepped in, and my body jerked awkwardly as I got used to the temperature. I then noticed how crowded the train was. There were people of all ages, and all stages of life. If I were a people watcher, this would be one hell of an interesting place to be. Conversations of all kinds, different languages, all belong to someone with a story. I had my own story. Everyone on this train was going somewhere, meeting someone, doing something. I was just another one of those people, caught up in the love story unfolding in front of me. It made me wonder how many people my stories would reach. I was just another human with a story. Just another person going somewhere, doing something, meeting someone. I took a seat next to my brother, feeling quite squished between the wall and him, because he was a literal giant- he takes up so much damn space. I stared at the graffiti covered wall as my mind began to wonder. I was growing nervous on the thought of actually being in the same room and breathing the same air as my long-distance boyfriend. I was actually going to be next to him. I was so scared of what he would think of me, my hair, face, eyes…

“Are you nervous?” My brother’s voice cut through my thoughts.
“Yeah, a little.”
“It's gonna be fine. Just don't blow your cover,” he said with a stupid smug grin on his face.

I couldn't blow my cover. If that were to happen…

“Hey,” he nudged my side. 

“We’re here.”

I looked up and out the window. I saw the giant buildings looming over the city overhead. The skyscrapers were touching the clouds that passed by, covering their barely-visible peaks. It was a breathtaking view. It looked like a view straight out of a movie. 

I felt a longing tug on my heart:

Where could Daniel be in all that chaos?

Would I actually be able to see him?

The train slowed to a stop, and the screeching of the brakes could be heard from inside the train car. The train finally stopped with a loud, exhausting breath, and the doors opened soon after. I stepped out the train doors and onto the dirty white tile floor as an automated voice warned of a countdown until the train doors shut again. The air was cold yet musky, serving a warning against the oncoming cold to be expected from the surface. The walls looked run-down with time. If those walls could speak, I'm sure they would have countless stories to tell. The whole place was illuminated by bulbs that did not match, some gray-blue while others an intense yellow. The colors clashed against each other, giving the whole place an almost uncanny feel. “Yeesh- I want out.” It was starting to creep me out, as the place seemed like something out of a horror story. We walked out of the train stop and into a small underground commerce. It was lined with fast food restaurants like Subway and Mcdonalds, and small gift shops for tourists on either side of the walls. We kept walking for a while until my mom pointed out the exit into the city. We started walking up the exit ramp, the cold air rushing in from outside blowing into me with such a force that it almost knocked me over. I blinked a few times to adjust to the bright light from the sun as we walked out and into the city from the underground station. I knew it was past mid-day, but the sun (being directly in front of the exit) was blinding. When my eyes adjusted to the blaring light of the sun, I saw the city. It lived up to the name “The Concrete Jungle,” as it was just buildings and sidewalks of similar shades as far as the eye could see. Almost every building was glittering with Christmas decorations; it was the 26th of December after all. Christmas was yesterday. It contrasted the city’s (assuming) usual grayness. I felt a surge of excitement pulsing through my veins, leaving a buzzing sensation on my fingertips. 

I got on a discord call with Daniel as soon as I had the internet to communicate with him. I told Daniel that I had made it, and that we were making our way to Times Square. I realized that we would need to see exactly where we both were in order to make sure we would ensure that we met. I let him know that we could see our locations on the snap map. “That's a good idea,” I thought to myself, praising my last minute thinking skills. I checked his location. “He’s only two blocks away.” My heart skipped a beat at the sight on my phone. He told me that had been waiting for me in a Starbucks near the exit of a subway for two or three hours. It was in that moment that I realized just how much I truly meant to him. I mean, the guy bought a friggin’ plane ticket to New York from Florida just to try (not even certain that he would) find me in a sea of people just to show how much he pursued me and loved me. I felt light blush dust over my face at the realization, the warm sensation on my cheeks serving like a welcoming relief from the biting cold. We started making our way to Time Square by foot. The cold air was whipping against my face as I told Daniel my every turn and location. My heart fluttered as I saw his bitmoji icon get closer to me on my map. 

“The snap map says you're on my street. I'm behind you but on the other side of the road. Wait. Where are you?” His voice on the call said that sent chills down my spine. He was so close by.

I started to look around frantically, my eyes scanning the streets for any sign of Daniel. My brother caught me searching like a mad woman, and told me to stop. “Keep moving straight,” Julian said through gritted teeth, jutting his eyes to beckon me forward. My dad, taking notice of my wild expression and actions, was asking if I dropped something or if I was ok. I told him that I was just admiring the city, and that there were just too many people. He seemed to buy my lie, and I breathed a sigh of relief. He was the least likely of my family members to sense my lies. He didn't seem to suspect me, which was reliving. I felt my head start to throb and my heart start hammering against my chest. Daniel’s voice sounded through my airpods, repeating his question from earlier, and I realized that I had not responded to him. “I just passed a drug store- the one with the green LED’s.” I heard that he hesitated for a moment- his voice hitched. “You mean the one that says ‘VAPE KING’ on it?” His words, slow and deliberate, as if trying to gain clarity, made me slow down my walking subconsciously. I looked up at the green sign, buzzing an incessant and monotone tune. My heart’s pace started to accelerate as I pulled my phone out of my pocket and opened the snapchat map. 

“Yeah. That one.” 

A rush of adrenalin overwhelmed every one of my senses as I realized that he was right across the street from me. I looked up slowly from my phone and at the sidewalk across the street to my right. In the sea of people, I couldn't miss his distinct smile. 

It was him.

I saw him.

For the first time, I laid eyes on my boyfriend.

For real.

Like an idiot, I started waving frantically to get his attention. The moment Daniel looked over, Julian had yanked me down so hard I almost fell on my butt. He scolded me in a hushed whisper, but his quiet effort to not draw attention to the situation did not hide the anger in his tone. “Do you want to blow your cover Amanda!?! You're lucky mom or dad didnt see you do that!” I was too excited, so he was right. If my parents found out…no. “I can't think that right now,” I thought to myself. I was too close. Panicking right now would serve me no good. The next store over from the drug store was a cute Hello Kitty store. I was extremely disoriented, my thoughts in a disarray of madness. “Do you want to go to this store Amanda?” My mom’s question pierced through my thoughts. Her question confused me, as the information overload was making it difficult for me to process what she said. “There are alot of people though,” she continued. I took a breath and reorganized my thoughts, the small action not going unnoticed by my mother. She gave me a concerned look, but I ignored it. I gathered the little mental organization I had left and I told my mom that I wanted to explore it. This was a good place to buy some time to come up with a plan to calm myself down. We went inside the Hello Kitty store. It was decorated in pastel colors of pink, blue, yellow and purple, and several rows of Sanrio merchandise stocked the shelves. I tried to compose myself in the store, but my mom asked me what was wrong. She noticed the bewildered and nervous look on my face. I could feel her suspicions growing. I could not under any circumstance let her know what was going on. If she knew I was going to meet a boy, my life would end. All my privileges would be striped away from me forever, and they would only give me what they were legally obliged to give me, like food, water, and clothing. I blamed my look on overstimulation, which wasn't a total lie; I have severe ADHD, and overstimulation isn't rare for me. In fact, who’s to say I wasn't actually overstimulated? The intense colors and blaring lights did make my head hurt, and there were way too many people, especially in that store. 

After I composed myself, I began to think about what store I could meet Daniel in. I was blankly staring at a hello kitty plush when Daniel’s voice reminded me that we were still on a call. “I'm crossing the street to you. I saw you.” My heart leaped. A smile crept onto my face. 

When my mom noticed I wasn't going to buy anything, we left the store, and we collectively continued to walk straight. I looked around for Daniel, but I felt a little defeated when I didn't spot him as I left the store. Almost as if he knew, I heard Daniel’s soothing voice through the airpod hidden in my hair. “I'm right behind you. I waited for you guys outside the store you entered.” My previous sadness was replaced with overwhelming excitement, but a realization hit me;

He was… where?
 
I turned around, slowly. There he was. He was following us, but he kept his distance to avoid being spotted by my parents. His blond hair peeked under his gray beanie, and he had on a black coat that covered his maroon Dr. Pepper crewneck, deep blue jeans, and a gray scarf. I felt that my heart would nearly explode then and there. He waved at me as he acknowledged my gaze, and I waved back. My brother spun me around to continue walking straight, as my slowed walking disturbed the flow of the sidewalk traffic. I didn't get a good look at his face, but I didn't miss his smile. His smile was definitely infectious, as I felt the corners of my own mouth curl into a smile too. God, I needed some kind of excuse to see and talk to him directly. “Ask your mom to let you go to that Old Navy over there,” he said, almost as if he was reading my thoughts. 

Good idea.

Somehow, I successfully got my mother to let my brother and I go alone to venture into the store. I wasn't expecting she would as she doesn't like crowds, but nevertheless I didn't question her strange decision. We walked up to the massive store. It was two or three stories tall, with a giant blue Old Navy LED sign near the top of the building. As we were about to enter, my mother announced that they would wait outside. 

Yes! This was perfect! Things were actually starting to clear a path to success.

I said a hurried goodbye to my parents and booked it inside toward the escalator. I didn't dare look back, because I knew I was still in my parents’ line of sight. I wouldn't want to lock eyes with my mother and make her believe I wanted for her to come in with me mistakenly. I went up to the second floor with Julian, and I expected for Daniel to be following suit. I got off the escalator, and we waited for Daniel to arrive. I felt adrenaline pulsing through every fiber of my being. My heart was hammering so hard against my chest I swear I was going to faint. My body felt light. I nearly fell over when I saw his head as the escalator continued its slow ascent. When he was fully on my floor, I just stood and stared at him, smiling. 

He’s so handsome. 
He’s so tall!
That’s my boyfriend?
I'm so lucky.

So many thoughts raced through my mind, causing my head to throb a little. I stood there, admiring everything about him. I knew what he looked like, as we had facetimed several times before, but it was so different seeing him in person. I immediately found myself thinking “how on earth did I bag him?” several times. I always knew Daniel was tall, being 6 ‘2, and for whatever reason I didn't think he would be much taller, as I am 5’8. But when I saw him, standing in front of me, I realized that our height difference was actually quite notable. It was very cute.

I moved closer to him. There was still about 10 feet of distance in between us. 
“Hi..”
“Hi..”
“Hey,”
“Hey.”

Ugh- his voice. It was low and calm, but I didn't miss the slight tone of anticipation in his tone. I noticed that his voice was deeper than what it sounded on a call. I have always found his voice attractive, but this was a new level of attractiveness. When he spoke, the audio in my airpods delayed his voice. It was crazy that that was finally happening. I muted the discord call. I could feel my cheeks heating up. There was a heavy atmosphere of awkwardness as we exchanged nervous glances and greetings. The awkward tension was too much to bear. This was my boyfriend for Christ’s sake! Then I felt something took over. I don't know if it was the awkwardness getting too hard to bear, the adrenaline I built up overtime and it just boiled over, or just my intense personality; whatever it was, It led me to do something neither of us expected.

I ran up and hugged him.

I was expecting him to pull away from the hug, or atleast take a few seconds to adjust to it, but I was surprised when he immediately hugged me back with no hesitation. I think he was longing for it just as I was. The first thing I noticed was how strong he was. I could feel the muscles from his arms wrapping around me as he hugged me tightly. He managed to hug me so tight it almost hurt, but I really didn't mind. I also noticed how warm he was. I have heard his family call him a “portable heater” a few times, and I definitely understood what they meant now. He was warm. Not feverishly warm, but more of a welcoming warm. I I dug my face into his chest as we hugged for a while. I felt a strange wave of overwhelming safety wash over my body. I felt so protected and safe, almost as if nothing could hurt me as long as I was in his arms. I dug my face even further into his chest, and that's when I realized how good he smelled. He smelled like a warm cozy night huddled up by a fire, or a sophisticated glass of bourbon- whatever it was, It was addicting. 

I looked up at him from our hug as my brother made fun of us. “Looks like you both got catfished.” My boyfriend laughed as I glared at my brother. I couldn't hold any anger though, as the sound of Daniel’s laugh melted me. Again, noticing that his voice was much deeper in person than on a call made my heart flutter. I felt like I was falling in love all over again. We let go of each other, and Daniel then awkwardly tossed me a little box. “I got you something.” Excitement gripped me as I realized it was time to exchange gifts. I had prepared a gift of my own to give him. I was so much more focused on seeing his expression that I forgot to open the gift he had given me. I had made him a little jar of little notes on why I loved him, a little plush that smelled of my perfume, and a little Bakugo keychain that I made (we both like my hero, it matched with my Deku keychain). His reaction made every effort to meet him in secret worth it. Seeing his genuine smile was priceless.

 All three of us talked for a bit. We talked about how crazy it was that all of this was actually happening.  I mean, this was all once just a conversation, and now it was actually happening. Daniel gave me endless compliments on my looks. I returned the compliments eagerly. Our height difference was actually so damn cute- I couldn't get over it. I could not take my eyes away from his smile and eyes. How on earth was I supposed to kiss this guy? I felt as if he was way out of my league. My stomach churned with nervousness at the idea of having my first kiss with him. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that my brother was cringing at our interactions. I don't really blame him, he’s third wheeling, but he had to; he was our lookout. My brother later suggested that we take a photo together, and I thought It was an amazing idea. Daniel hugged me again and smiled at my brother's camera. I did the same. I finally had solid proof of our relationship.

In fear that we were taking up too much time, Julian suggested we depart from the store. I told Daniel to follow us to Bryant park to the Christmas flea market. He excitedly agreed. I enveloped him in another tight hug. I exhaled deeply, knowing that I belonged in his arms just as he did in mine. Our bodies molded perfectly together; we were made for eachother. After a few moments, he hesitated to let me go. I could feel him slowly loosening his grip on me before he finally released me. I took a few paces backward, knowing that this would be a temporary goodbye. As I turned toward the escalator's direction, it felt like every step I took was going against gravity itself. I was bound to him. He and I both knew that Daniel needed to stay behind for a few moments before following me, as to not draw the attention of my overprotective parents as we left. It was then that I realized that eventually, I would at some point have to leave for real, and I know it would not be an easy departure.

My brother and I met up with my family and Zoe, and we made our way to the flea market. Daniel hopped back on the call to confirm with me that he was following us, and a part of me relaxed. “It isn't goodbye just yet,” I thought to myself, shaking away my prior ambiguous grieving for the event yet to come. The walk to the park wasn't too long; It was only a few blocks away from Time Square. The view of the city in front and above us was amazing. The sun was just beginning to set; the sweet golden light blended seamlessly with the light blue sky. As cars sped past, they stirred up a gust of cold wind mixed with the smell of car exhaust in their wake. People on the sidewalk rushed and pushed around us going in all different directions, focused on getting to their destinations. 

We arrived at the flea market, people crowding the streets. Zoe was insistent on getting us to try the hot chocolate sold there, but we had all agreed to look at some stalls first. I scanned the sea of people for my boyfriend, and to my surprise, I saw that Daniel had actually gotten to the market first. He was waiting for me. I texted him to stay where he was. I managed to convince my mother to let me and my brother explore alone, without raising any suspicions. As soon as we lost sight of my mom, dad, and Zoe, I started toward Daniel. We made electrifying eye contact, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as he waved me over. He instantly put a muscular arm around me and the feeling of security returned, bringing me a sensation of peace in the midst of the whole stressful adventure. I was exactly where I wanted to be. In his arms. We walked around, keeping a watchful eye to see if my parents would appear, as we had no idea where they could be. It was thrilling as it was nerve wracking, because if they found me in the arms of a boy, it would all end. I wasn’t about to ruin my first relationship. I wanted to do the most couple stuff that I could before this day ended, so I got touchy. I took Daniel’s arm off of me, and I took off one of his gloves as he talked to my brother. I felt like a child, in the safety of their parents' company. I clasped his bare hand in mine. So warm. so…Soft? I was a little caught off guard by the softness of his hands, considering that he worked as a blacksmith and goes to the gym regularly to lift heavy weights. He had previously told me that he had rough hands, so I silently teased him in my mind. We held hands for a while as I touched and poked him everywhere. I felt like a little kid as I complimented incessantly everything about him, and I could tell that he found my actions extremely adorable by the way he smiled at me warmly and called me cute. My intensity was taking over, but he didn't mind. After a bit, he put his glove back on and wrapped his arm around me as we continued to wander.

We were walking around when my parents appeared out of nowhere. 

Shit!

Daniel saw them too. He immediately let go of me and pushed forward to advance into the crowd. He hid his face from my family. As Daniel walked away, my mom gave him a weird look as he left, and fear overtook my body. What was she thinking? Is the jig up? What was she going to say? Despite the bitter cold of winter in New York, an intense heat of panic washed over my body. My brother deterred my mom’s attention by talking about something in a stall he wanted, and I mouthed a siglent “thank you” to him. Many thoughts pulsed through my mind as my mom’s face changed back to a smile. I was worried she would remember him. She didn't speak of him to me, so I assumed she just thought he was a creep. Julian didn't say anything about it to my mom, which I believe dismissed any possible negative thoughts about Daniel in her mind as Julian is usually always protecting me from creeps. She knew that Julain would never let a stranger touch me.

Best first impression ever.

I knew my mother would forget him, as Daniel wont be my official boyfriend until he moves closer to me, and that would take about a year. 

To lower any suspicions from my parents, we followed them around the market for a bit. After a while, we walked up to the hot coco stall, when we realized there was a huge line. It was absolutely massive; there had to be about 100 people or so in that line. “We are going to stay in line with Zoe to get the ‘famous hot coco’ she wants us to try.” My mother’s tone carried a tired heaviness- I could tell that she was not overjoyed to wait in that monster of a line. I swear, I’ve seen rollercoaster lines shorter than that one, and it was just for hot chocolate. Nevertheless, this was the perfect excuse to slip away again. We told our folks that we wanted to keep exploring, and that waiting in the line would be too tedious. My brother and I wandered off from them again, and this time we knew where my folks would be. 

We met up with Daniel again, and I noticed he was still a little shaken from the close-call. He was very jumpy. He kept looking around and was questioned if it was safe. I took his hand and reassured him. 

My intensity was at an all time high by this point. I stood on a stone block border, and I jumped on him. He laughed, not expecting my sudden action. He hugged me tight. I felt like every struggle we’ve endured was worth it for this moment. We didn't want to be so exposed and out in the open while hugging, so all three of us hid behind a stone-fenced ramp. Daniel and I sat on the fence ridge, close to the ground. We sat next to each other, our thighs touching. The sun was almost fully set, bathing everything in a beautiful golden light. Where we sat, there was a giant christmas tree, filled with ornaments and lights that were colors of gold and red. There was a beautiful gold star on the top of the majestic tree. In the background, people could be heard walking behind the ramp ridge we sat on. 

I looked at Daniel as he conversed with my brother. He was breathtaking. The gold light that filtered through the tall buildings hit his gorgeous blue eyes, making them sparkle like a jewel under light, and illuminating his hair to appear like pure gold strands from under his beanie. I took his hand once more, taking off his glove and feeling his hand. I traced my fingers over the crevices of his palm, once again feeling how soft his hand was. “You have soft hands.” I teased him as he awkwardly fumbled to explain that “It was just cold and that they aren't actually soft.” He then wrapped his muscular arm around my shoulder, pulling me in closer. I rested my head on his shoulder, my hand placed on his chest. I could feel his chest muscles moving through his maroon crew neck as he adjusted to me. That crew neck was the one I had picked out for him when we were online shopping together. It was thoughtful of him to wear it today. “I'm gonna miss you Daniel.” I said, knowing that at some point, this moment would end. Nuzzling my face more into his chest now, I breathed In deeply, inhaling his scent. He had me wrapped in his arms fully by this point, both arms cradling me gently. “I'm gonna miss you too, Amanda, he said in a soft tone. He rested his head on my head. He moved his head soon after into a position that would allow him to look at me directly. I lifted my eyes toward his. I stared into his deep blue sunlit eyes. “You have beautiful eyes.” The words I was about to say came out of his mouth, catching me by surprise. My eyes were just brown, but he saw something in them that drew him closer to me. He told me that eyes are the window to the soul, and my eyes showed him how beautiful my soul was. I smiled at him as he held me tightly. My heart started beating hard. I reached up and I kissed his cheek, having to put some pressure on my feet to reach his face. His skin felt cold, cheeks rosie due to the unforgiving cold. In return, leaned in to kiss me, but panic got the best of me and gave him my cheek. He teased me about it as I embarrassedly apologized for my awkwardness. His lips on my skin felt cold as well, but they carried a warmth that I could not explain. It was pleasant, nonetheless. When he pulled away, My eyes met his. I knew what was coming next.

My heart was pounding. 
It felt like every nerve on my body was on fire with anticipation. My mind became clouded with excitement, and I felt like I was about to explode with joy.
The world began to slow. The sound of people faded as it became just us two in the sunset.

We both leaned in

And we kissed.

It was strange. It didn't feel like “fireworks” or any other intense emotion typically exemplified in movies or shows.

Instead, all my built up adrenaline and worries just…

Melted away.

As his lips pressed against mine, it became just us under the partially-showing stars in the sky; the sun steadily setting in the distance. The sense of security swelled in my chest. When we pulled away, I saw his eyes sparkling with love and joy. His smile, God, his beautiful smile is forever engraved in my mind. He looked so happy to have finally kissed me, after being online for so long. My cheeks were flushed and warm, and I couldn't tell if the buzzing I felt on my face was due to the cold or the love I felt surging through every nerve of my body. I don't know what my face looked like, but it was his cue for him to kiss me again.

After the second kiss, I rested his head on my shoulder, slowly caressing his head with my hand. I whispered into his ear a simple phrase, but each word caring the weight of a thousand suns: 

“I love you, Daniel.”

A motherly sensation swelled in my chest as I held him close. I felt like I was now the one protecting him, shielding him from a dangerous world.

My brother interrupted.

“It's getting late Amanda, mom and dad are bound to get suspicious.” My brother urged.
With his words, I snapped back to reality. 

It was the end.

But I wasn't ready to let go.

Daniel and I stood up from our spot. That spot would forever carry the memories of my first kiss with the love of my life. Forever. 

I looked at Daniel, and I hugged him tightly, trying not to cry.
“I don't want you to go, but I need to get back too. It’s almost sunset,” he said, a heaviness in his tone that indicated his sadness at the truth. The light that shone from the sun was only a sliver.

He was right.

I hugged him tight, struggling to hold back tears. 
I cupped his face with both of my hands as he gave me a sweet smile, but his eyes betrayed the happiness he feigned. I felt a sensation eat away at my heart. Grief. I noticed I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Daniel’s facade was slipping, sadness overtaking the once happy smile on his face. I pulled his head closer to mine, stood on my tip-toes, and I leaned in and kissed him one last time.

The sun set.

With heavy hearts, we said our goodbyes.

As I walked, I turned around and noticed him watching me as I walked away from the spot. Our spot. I kept walking forward as my brother urged me on. I was torn between seeing him once more or avoiding any more painful feelings I knew would be evoked just by looking at him again. 

But I just needed one more glance.

 I didn't know when the next time I would see him would be. My longing and anxiety overtook me, forcing me to pause and turn in his direction again. When I turned that last time, just to see his sweet face once more, he had already disappeared into the sea of people. 

It was at that moment when I became aware of just how cold it really was. All this time, I paid no mind to the cold, as my source of warmth had been Daniel. Not just his physical body heat, but how he made me feel too; every one of his actions to get closer to me carried a warmth that made me feel immune to the cold. He was the sun that warmed up my world, but now that the sun had set, the cold was unbearable.

Julian and I met up with the rest of my family and Zoe at the coco stall. Sure enough, they had just received their orders and were about to call us. As my mom handed me my drink, my mind was fixed on Daniel. I sat on a stone fence, my legs dangling on the side. It was a busy night; people crowding the flea market, the smell of deep-fried goods lingering in the air, and city lights that surrounded every corner of the park. I sat there, hot coco in hand, staring off into the glittering city. The spectacular view of the city evoked a feeling I had previously felt on the train here, before seeing Daniel. 

Where could Daniel be in all that chaos?

I prayed a siglent prayer that we would be able to meet again soon. The cold of the night seemed to be getting worse, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was because Daniel was getting further and further away from me. I looked at my hot coco, the steam dancing as it rose from my cup and disappeared into the night air. Taking a sip, I burned my tongue with the hot liquid. 

While walking back to the train station, I had put my hands in my pockets when I felt a small box in my right pocket. 

“Oh right, the gift he gave me.”

I pulled out the small pink box. “I completely forgot about this.” I opened the small box gently, a melancholic sensation building up inside of me with each moment of my hands. I got the box open, and there was a pretty silver ring with my name on it.

“Amanda <3”

I stared at the ring. My heart mixed with emotions of bittersweet love: The gift was so thoughtful, yet the reminder that it would be a while until our next meeting left a bitter taste in my mouth. I kept my gaze fixed on the ring. I was happy about the gift, but at the same time I felt profound sadness that I was unable to thank him in person. I put the ring on as we continued walking. 

I’m gonna miss you Daniel.

Ever since I bought a grinder and started using fresh coffee beans, I’ve become the designated barista at home.

So, I brewed two cups of black coffee (Aranya Gold) using SIF—one for myself and one for my dad. Then, I was about to make South Indian filter coffee (Continental Malgudi, 80% coffee 20% chicory) for my sister. Just as I was about to discard the spent grounds (Aranya Gold), I had an idea—what if I layer the Malgudi one on top of the used Aranya Gold grounds and brew again?

The result? A surprisingly good decoction with an enhanced flavour!

I was making a coffee, (decaf of course) and Hascal was outside with a few other dogs after breakfast. 

I was only gone a few minutes, but when I returned, hot cup of coffee in hand, HASCAL had “made friends” with a little bird. 

The delicate little bird could not be Hascal’s friend in return and I came out the door to see a triumphant Hooskie Tot and a bird that just took its last breath. 

I make sure to have my bird feeders outside the fence and I try to make everything safe for everyone, but this I couldn’t control or prevent. Nature overruled me. 

HOW he got the bird, I don’t know. I wasn’t there. 

I took the bird to the grave and I was sad but I was also mad as a hornet, kids. 

Did the birdie suffer? That little birdie was just out for the morning having some seeds and BAM Hascal decided to “make a play friend”. 

He doesn’t really understand why his friend stopped moving. He wasn’t what you’d call “aggressive” or “violent” — he didn’t know his own strength or size compared to the bird. He didn’t know the consequences of his actions, and he didn’t have one iota of remorse either.

But I did.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve noticed something strange with my Krups Essenza Mini. When I turn it on, as it starts blinking to warm up, a small amount of water leaks from the tube where the coffee pod is supposed to go—this happens before I insert any capsule, with the lever still open. Is this normal?

Another issue is that some coffee shots aren’t coming out as 40ml (for espresso) but closer to 30ml. But not always, most of the times 40 ml espresso comes out. After brewing, when I open the lever, water drips from behind the capsule into the capsule tray. I’ve especially noticed this with Arpeggio capsules.

I descaled the machine about two days ago. Could something be wrong with it?

Alright, folks, buckle up because the market's having one of those weeks where it stares into the abyss and wonders where it all went wrong. Overall sentiment is more bearish than a grizzly bear woken up from hibernation.

Palantir (PLTR) got a sweet $178 million Army contract, but the market shrugged and sent it tumbling. Apparently, being overvalued is a bigger crime than serving lukewarm coffee in the Pentagon.

AppLovin (APP) got smacked with an -18.36% price decline. S&P 500 inclusion? Cool. Securities fraud lawsuit and ""forced shadow downloads""? Not so cool.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI), bless its AI-loving heart, is NASDAQ compliant. But even AI can't save it from a slight price decrease.

Rubrik (RBRK) is getting the insider sell-off treatment despite a ""Strong Buy"" rating. When the CTO bails, should you be buying? I'll let you ponder that.

Even Ford (F) is just kinda... there. Low valuation, ""Hold"" rating. Exciting.

Now, for the good news (sort of): AI is still the golden child. Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) are strutting their stuff, fueled by AI chip demand. But even NVDA is getting side-eye for potential Chinese competition and, you guessed it, valuations.

The Money Fear and Greed Index is flashing ""Extreme Fear."" So, you know, business as usual.

So nearly after two months we started to see each other a little bit. Coffee dates, chatting, even some beers. But from the first moment I was clear I really don’t want a relationship with her. The breakup was painful for both of us and I just don’t see us coming back together at this time. We both need to grow. 

I was clear about the fact that I’m still attracted to her sexually. When we first met we became friends with benefits and with the time we became bf and gf. So I thought that I had to be honest and tell her that. She was concerned about the fact to become fwb because for her that would re ignite old feelings and at the end we will be just repeating our story. 

But we kept seeing each other. We really like to spend time together, we are by times behaving like a couple and we even spend nights together watching movies or so… one of those nights we kind of fool around a little bit. Nothing serious. I guess we both have the urge to have sex. After fooling around a little bit nothing happened and we said goodbye and that was it. I didn’t give that much of a thought about it. But the next day when we went out for coffee she told me that she thinks that we should keep our distance. That even if she still have feelings for me we need to be friends and only friends. 

This is something I completely understand from her behalf but the reality is that we were never friends or at least not in the common way. Our relationship from the beginning has been full of touching, caring for each other even more than ordinary friends. And that’s what it makes it so difficult. Cuz I feel that at some point (and she agrees with me) we are behaving strange between us. Just not to cross any limits. 

So now we are in this point of trying to have a distance between us but I feel that at the end it won’t last. Even she said that at some point we probably will end crossing the line and become intimate. 

I told her that for me that wouldn’t create a problem. Cuz neither her or I have the intention to become a couple again. We are just enjoying each other company. And that if that happens it’s because both of us wants that to happen. 

I’m not trying to get back with her but I really miss us being just us. Without any labels and just enjoy each other company and doing what we feel. I guess 3 years together as fwb and as bf and gf. Gave us this bad habits. But to be honest I don’t mind. Cuz even if I don’t see her as a girlfriend right now I know that once we both grow up and change some stuff we have to work on we would be the perfect match. 

I know that some of you will say that I’m behaving like an asshole or that I should not hurt her or blah blah. But at least I’m being 100% honest with her. If we are honest to each other that’s all that matters.

First, I'd like to thanks Pubtips. I received so many amazing advice from people that help me improve a lot as a writer. Although, I can't help but wonder if at this point I shouldn't just start write another novel before entering the query trenches (again.) But now, i don't know if I should. I feel like my idea is not commercially enticing for literary agents. I know how the world works. I'm not here to complain about literary agents doing their job, AKA acquiring manuscripts that would sell. Because that's what both parties want. But like, I don't know if mine would. I'm writing a cozy with a mostly male cast and positive character arc even though I know this is a female dominated genre with flat character arc. I made sure to include a comp with a male lead in a cozy mystery in my query letter, but now I wonder if I shouldn't I just shelve this one and write a cozy with a female cast?

Dear agent, 

I saw on your MSWL that you’re looking for \_\_\_, I hope you’ll consider my cozy mystery novel THE SECRET LIFE OF A PET DETECTIVE complete at 70,000 words. It combines the whip-smart amateur detective from J.C. Kenney *Elmo Simpsons’ Mystery series* and the pet-shelter setting of T.C. LoTempio *Cat Rescue Mystery* series. It features #ownvoice Asian American experience with a multicultural cast. 

With a pet-pageant around the corner, the picture-purr-fect East Valley is aquiver with excitement. For twenty-three-year-old Clark Zhang, it’s another miserable day in his miserable life. After failing Cornell vet school, he’s back in his hometown working at the family pet shelter, dreaming of pouncing back to vet school. That is until he finds out their landlord, Mr. Baxter, is about to seize the place because of financial troubles –mostly because of his (failed) ivy education.

Stewing in guilt, Clark sets to negotiate with the landlord’s wife, head of the local Humane Society, to throw the ulti-mutt fundraise; introducing rescue pets in the dog show. Instead, he finds himself and his old high school crush performing CPR on Mrs. Baxter. To top it all off, the Baxters’ average-sized poodle Jeremiah, heir to his mistress’s fortune, is missing and his high school buddy turned cop is hounding him. 

Luckily, John Baxter, the victim’s son, knows too much. Clark has until the pageant to make him collaborate if he wants to save the family business, get the girl, and clear his name. Otherwise, Mr. Baxter might put his strip mall plan into action. That is if the killer doesn’t catch him for sniffing too close to the truth.

From the front window of the East Valley's Pet Shelter, the world was a pale shade of indigo. The hints of red in the east behind the sprawling mansions announced the beginning of another scorching day. For Clark Zhang, this was the start of another mediocre day in his mediocre hometown, in his mediocre life as a pet shelter attendant.

The young man took a long sip of coffee from his Cornell University mug, barely tasting the bitter aroma, and hunched his shoulders over his horseshoe desk. The glow of his computer highlighted the dark circles under his almond-shaped eyes. Missing pet emails from anxious pet owners flooded the shelter’s inbox. Dog theft wasn’t usually a problem in East Valley, where purebreds and the occasional F1 pup were the norm. But with the dog show coming up, the young man knew this was only the beginning.

Clark replied with the shelter’s form, reminding people to make an appointment if the pet hadn’t been found in the next twenty-four hours following the disappearance. This usually reduced the number of cases by half.

The bell above the door jingled, and Lindsay Taylor, Sweet Whisker Bakery’s manager, walked in. Her crystal-clear voice instantly broke the monotony of his day. “Good morning, everyone!” She dropped five boxes–one small stacked on top of four larger boxes- in front of Clark and wiped beads of sweat on her forehead.

His heart skipped a beat, and heat crept up his cheeks. “H—hi,” he managed. For a moment, the young man forgot everything about his job and the pet theft situation. He smiled at his old high school crush. As usual, she was wearing her usual work uniform–a pair of jeans, a green T-shirt, and a black apron. ",0,1741357024.0,PubTips,0,0.5,False

I love drinking my morning coffee or evening tea from a ceramic mug so I wanted to make a custom one that expressed my new love for AG. This was made for my own personal enjoyment and not for any other reason. If they had an official mug being sold I would definitely purchase it.,16,1741356882.0,AtarashiiGakko,0,1.0,False

Should the finishes match?,"Slowly revamping entryway/living room/kids play room... the current curtains are too heavy and the rod is ripping the wall. I'm looking to get other curtains maybe a greige color? I’m confused on the finishes of the light fixtures and curtain rod. The blue couch was originally in the play room but swapped it for the bean bag... it's a love sac, eventually I want to change the couch blue fabric to sky grey fabric. 

I need help with deciding which new light fixture for entry way, new light fixture or fan in the play room (thinking about a fandelier), new credenza for entry way (for shoe storage), curtains and curtain rod, mirror for entry way, maybe new wall art. The giant fish tank is leaving eventually so pretend that's already gone lol. Once the fish tank is gone eventually I’ll need a coffee table… also not sure which one.

Striving for a modern transitional, clean look. Obviously I need all the help I can get. Thank you!!",2,1741356859.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

It’s been a wild two years for the Pontoon crew, but I’m happy to say that we’re still here and kicking for our 7th Anniversary this weekend!

Between Bevana owing us .5 million dollars (Pelican in LA owing us 150k and Pequod in Wisc owing us 30k), going through bankruptcy, having Georgia Crown randomly drop us in the middle of getting our bankruptcy plan approved via email, scrambling to get another distributor and navigating the current state of the industry, it’s been tough to say the least. Fortunately for us, we’ve had a very strong community to keep our taproom full, investors that believed in the vision, the tightest and most productive team to date, signing with Savannah and some new endeavors like co-packing THC beverages in house and getting a stout brothers coffee shop/Ghost Pizza permanently in our taproom, that are transforming our future at Pontoon.

We’ve got some new releases, some classics and a whole lot of fun things planned for this weekend! 

Over the last 7 years, a lot has changed, but I’d love to recapture some nostalgia and see you all out at the brewery this weekend! I’m going to do hosting a pre-opening bottleshare at some tables outside of Pontoon with some donuts and coffee for anyone looking to reconnect! Bring out some dusty bottles and join me at 11-12am. 

Thank you for all the support over the years and I really hope to see someone of you at the bottleshare! 

Cheers,
Sean O’Keefe",32,1741356839.0,atlbeer,10,0.93,False
