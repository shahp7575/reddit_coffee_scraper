Word of the Day: Mindfulness

Mindfulness isn‚Äôt about sitting still with your eyes closed; it‚Äôs about being fully alive in the moment you‚Äôre in. It‚Äôs noticing the way your breath steadies when you pause, the way your shoulders drop when you stop carrying yesterday‚Äôs weight, the way the world feels sharper when you actually pay attention. Mindfulness is choosing presence over autopilot, awareness over distraction. It‚Äôs what allows you to catch yourself before snapping in frustration, or to savor the sip of coffee instead of gulping it down unnoticed. In practice, it‚Äôs the art of being here, completely here, where your life is actually unfolding.

Today, I want you to pick one moment and refuse to let it pass without presence. Whether it‚Äôs a conversation, a meal, or a simple walk, meet it with full awareness. Let your focus be so strong that everything else fades, even if only for a few breaths.

Harness the challenge of Mindfulness to center your thoughts, strengthen your steps, and kindle your hope.",1,1760249753.0,Word_of_The_Day_Affir,0,1.0,False

It's a little awkward because from the front door, you have to pass behind the couch or through the room to get to the kitchen (point of view from the camera). I would like the new decoration to be vintage/antique but cozy and cute.

Here are some of my ideas in the mockup:

\- Darker, more oriental rug

\- Change TV stand to be an antique hutch of somekind

\- Pillows with vintage print

\- Change art to be more vintage

\- Vintage side table (I do not want a coffee table because the center of the room is the only place my puppy can really play)

\- Add a few plants

\- Add more texture with chunky blanket, pillows, etc

\- Raise curtains a foot

Please help with suggestions! We are renting. I provided a before pic, mock up pic, and a few inspo pics.

Now, for some context, because it will be necessary to accurately describe what I'm trying to illustrate - I know I'm attractive by conventional standards, especially to the male gaze. I'm aware that I have a face and body features that are, and have been sexualized ever since I was a child. What exaggerates the problem is that I'm often mistaken for someone 10 years younger because of my looks and voice. Just a few weeks ago, someone doubted I'm an adult.

I'm really fortunate to be working for an employer who respects me for my aptitude, and has always allowed me to step away from situations where I feel uneasy because someone crossed a line, including appropriate consequences. This is especially crucial because every person I work with is 10-25 years older than me, and often male. I'm still the youngest permanent employee despite leading a team of ten engineers & designers.

In the most important gatherings, I'm the only woman in a room of men who are much older. While they rarely show any overtly inappropriate gestures, there are subtle tensions during these events. I'm expected to talk and ""show myself"" more. I'm the person who's made to handle the angry clients most of the times by using my ""soft voice"" to calm the situation. At times I have to go alone for coffee/lunch for 1-on-1 discussions. I know I have the power to walk away from all this, but it's very subtly implied as a core responsibility of mine. Its not rare for presentations to get weird because I'm in the middle of explaining something important, but I KNOW their eyes are on my chest.

All this is still better than what used to be the case at one of my previous employers. On one occassion, I was asked to ""wear tighter clothes"" and ""keep my hair untied"" (it's knee length, so it's not easy) because a senior executive was visiting. And ever since my ex-collegues made a whatsapp group for sharing explicit, inappropriate remarks about me, I have had low tolerance for any harassment, it's straight to the HR.

In certain situations, I have learnt to sometimes let some men have a false idea that they \_might\_ have a chance with me, just to make the moment easier. In my experience, things almost always get worse when they realise they won't.

After nearly 10 years being an adult, and unfortunately many more of handling demons who prey on vulnerability, I'm used to living a life like this. It just feels exhausting, like it's the case right now.",0,1760249475.0,TwoXIndia,0,0.5,False

Dear Washoe County District Attorney‚Äôs Office, Public Defenders, and Honorable(?) Judge Barry Breslow,

Let's talk. I've spent the last two and a half years unwillingly enrolled in your innovative seminar titled ‚ÄúHow to Completely Ignore Constitutional Rights in 5 Easy Steps (and Still Get Away With It!)‚Äù ‚Äî a masterclass offered exclusively by Washoe County. Unfortunately, I never signed up for this class, and you forgot to include the refund policy.

The syllabus includes:

1. Selective Prosecution (Professor Aziz Merchant):
Aziz, buddy, what law school taught you that violent stabbings deserve a dismissive ‚Äúhey, just go home,‚Äù while civil property disputes require no less than a SWAT‚Äëstyle takedown? Is your policy manual the back of a cereal box? I'd ask for discovery, but we both know that would just trigger your office‚Äôs patented disappearing‚Äëvideo magic act‚ÄîDavid Copperfield would be impressed. You'd probably add another charge of ""requesting discovery with intent to cause accountability.""


2. Competency as Punishment (Special Guest Lecturer Amos Stege):
Amos, when I sent an email about my medical condition, you labeled it a ‚Äúthreat.‚Äù Seriously? I understand reading comprehension might be optional in your position, but do you need someone to show you what an actual threat looks like? Hint: it usually involves violence, not a health update. Then again, your courtroom record suggests you‚Äôre allergic to facts, logic, and human decency. Don‚Äôt worry; I‚Äôm sure there's an ointment for that. Check with your public information officer‚Äîmaybe that's her job.


3. Right to Counsel‚ÄîSort of, Maybe, Not Really (Professors Sydney Hutt, Kate Hickman & Gianna Verness):
Sydney, you successfully transformed ""effective assistance"" into ""effective disappearance,"" ghosting me harder than a bad Tinder date. Kate and Gianna, your idea of supervision is apparently letting your attorneys run wild with conflicts, filing unauthorized competency petitions, and blocking clients from court filings. I‚Äôve seen better oversight from asleep DMV clerks. But hey, at least the whole ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt file because you‚Äôre represented‚Äù scheme was creative‚Äîif ‚Äúcreative‚Äù meant ‚Äúunconstitutional and breathtakingly stupid.‚Äù You didn‚Äôt just cross ethical lines; you pole‚Äëvaulted them blindfolded.


4. Access to Courts (Judge Barry Breslow presiding, Kangaroo Court in Session):
Barry, your courtroom feels less like justice and more like a hostage negotiation. You've set a new standard for ""due process""‚Äîa sealed competency hearing without bona fide doubt followed by a no‚Äëbail warrant because I had the nerve to point out constitutional violations. Remember the Eighth Amendment? It‚Äôs the one that comes right after seven and just before nine. Excessive bail and cruel punishments are frowned upon. But maybe you‚Äôre reading from the ‚ÄúWashoe County Special Edition,‚Äù where constitutional amendments are optional and due process is more of a decorative garnish.


5. Public Information Office (Kendall Holcomb, Supreme Overlord of Twitter and Press Releases):
Kendall, as the only Public Information Officer whose official position apparently excludes ‚Äúgiving out public information,‚Äù you've really outdone yourself. Your primary role seems to be maintaining Christopher Hicks‚Äôs Twitter and filtering out inconvenient truths. I get it‚Äîactual information might confuse people. Better to stick with propaganda memes and cat videos, right? You might want to update your business cards: ""Public Information Officer‚ÄîInformation Not Included.""




---

Some Constitutional Facts Washoe County seems unaware of:

Brady/Giglio: It‚Äôs not a boutique coffee blend. You must disclose exculpatory evidence and impeachment material. But hey, hiding evidence is your preferred seasoning, right, Aziz?

Speedy Trial: Your version‚Äî‚Äúwhenever we feel like it‚Äù‚Äîis slightly off from the Sixth Amendment version, which says trials happen sooner than the next Ice Age.

Faretta v. California: You can‚Äôt force someone into a lawyer they didn‚Äôt ask for, gag them from filing pro se, and then claim ""due process"" with a straight face. That‚Äôs not due process; that's process-on-demand.

Competency Hearings: Competency isn‚Äôt your emergency lever to pull when defendants ask too many inconvenient questions. You actually need evidence. I know: shocking, right?



---

Immunity? Let‚Äôs talk about that:

Prosecutorial Immunity (Aziz, Amos): Absolute immunity covers advocacy in court, not cover-ups, hiding evidence, altering probable-cause sheets, or retaliating against protected filings. I checked‚Äîturns out it's not a blanket free pass to be terrible. Shocker, I know.

Judicial Immunity (Barry): This protects judicial acts‚Äînot administrative retaliation, secret competency ambushes, or warrant shenanigans to punish free speech. You don't get immunity when you weaponize your gavel.

Public Defender as State Actor (Sydney, Kate, Gianna, Patricia): Generally, public defenders aren't state actors. But when you file secret competency petitions without consent, coordinate with the DA against your client, and block pro se filings, you become joint actors. That means no immunity‚Äîjust accountability.



---

My Homework vs. Your Gaslighting:

Every time you said, ""That's just how it works,"" I cracked open another law book. I studied Stack v. Boyle (bail), Strickland v. Washington (counsel), Bounds v. Smith (court access), Brady/Giglio (discovery), and your very own Nevada statutes and court rules. Each thing you told me contradicted exactly what those laws said. You call my filings ""frivolous,"" but the law defines frivolous as ""no arguable basis in law or fact"" (Neitzke v. Williams). My filings are grounded directly in your own filings, emails, minutes, and rules you‚Äôve ignored.

So, here we are. You gaslight, I study. You retaliate, I file. You violate constitutional rights, I seek accountability. You smear me as unstable, yet the record proves otherwise. You‚Äôve created the best First Amendment auditor Nevada never asked for, simply by violating rights and refusing accountability.


---

Why I do this:

I had a career as an electrician. I didn‚Äôt wake up one day and choose to audit courts and prosecutors. But if you insist on trampling rights and running your courtroom as a carnival sideshow‚Äîcomplete with competency clowns, discovery magicians, and speedy-trial trapeze artists‚Äîyou leave no choice.

All of you have frosting smeared across your faces, but insist you never touched the cake. You mock the public by calling transparency unnecessary, evidence optional, and the Constitution a speed bump. Your entire office, from Kendall‚Äôs misinformation management to Amos‚Äôs imaginary threats, Aziz‚Äôs discovery disappearing act, Gianna‚Äôs competency stunts, Sydney‚Äôs ghosting, Kate‚Äôs absentee supervision, and Barry‚Äôs kangaroo justice, has become an unconstitutional clown car‚Äîcrowded, chaotic, and headed for a constitutional cliff.


---

This is not a cry for help. It‚Äôs a Public Service Announcement.

Citizens have rights. You have duties. And Nevada law has remedies for official misconduct‚ÄîNRS 197.200 explicitly forbids oppression under color of office. The Constitution is not decorative wall art for your offices; it‚Äôs the law you swore to uphold.

If you refuse to apply the law fairly, at least have the courage to put it plainly in writing‚Äîso I can escalate to appellate courts, mandamus, and federal remedies.

Washoe County citizens: demand accountability, demand transparency, demand competence. Or prepare to have your rights ‚Äúaudited‚Äù by the same constitutional chop-shop mechanics who‚Äôve handled mine.

As for the named officials: Congratulations on becoming a live case study on why judicial and prosecutorial immunity need reform. You're truly pioneers in teaching citizens why constitutional literacy matters‚Äîone violation at a time.

Sincerely (and constitutionally protected),

20% of days he can be cranky late afto like he really does still need his nap, and if we drive anywhere he will 100% nap. He now won‚Äôt go to bed until 9.30pm though. Even with the late bed, he will still wake 6am ish.

Turns out she lives in the same area as I do. So we plan a meetup and she invites me to her place. The boy was so excited ungedhania ni birthday yake üòÇüòÇ

So a back and forth ensued between me and the IRS. I admitted to making a clerical error, but assured them I paid. They said I didn't.

Smell: 2/10
This is where things get weird. There‚Äôs a strange chemical / off smell, can‚Äôt really describe it but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve noticed with any other brand. Definitely kills the mood when you open the tub.

Scoop: Slightly heaping above the baseline.

Like many of you, I have a digital hoarding problem. My phone and laptop are filled with thousands of screenshots, memes, and photos I can't bring myself to delete. The ""Storage Almost Full"" notification was my constant companion.

Instead of just downloading an existing tool, I did what any of us would do: I decided to build my own.

**The 6-Hour Rabbit Hole**

What started as a ""quick Python script"" turned into a full-blown side project saga. I fell deep into the PIL/Pillow library, wrestled with batch processing, and became weirdly obsessed with finding the perfect balance between file size and image quality.

After one long evening and several cups of coffee,¬†**PixTrim**¬†was born.

It‚Äôs a dead-simple web tool that compresses your images without massacring the quality. I built it for myself, but I figured if I had this problem, others might too.

**You can try it out here: \[Your Website Link\]**

**What it does:**

* **Compresses JPG & PNG**¬†images in bulk.
* **Preserves visual quality**¬†while significantly reducing file size.
* **It's all client-side**‚Äîyour images never touch my server. Privacy first!

This was one of those projects that was incredibly satisfying to build, even if the initial ""problem"" was somewhat self-created. It‚Äôs a classic case of a developer spending 6 hours to automate a 3-minute task, but now I have a tool I actually use.

I'd be thrilled if you gave it a try and let me know what you think. All feedback is welcome!

**TL;DR:**¬†Got tired of full storage, built a web-based image compressor in 6 hours. It's free, private, and you can use it here:¬†**\[https://image-compressor-five-azure.vercel.app/\]**

We‚Äôre a married couple‚Äî38M and 35F‚Äîlooking to explore a closed polyfidelity relationship (F+F+M). We're fairly new to polyamory and taking things slow, starting with friendship and seeing where the connection leads. Ideally, we‚Äôre hoping to find a woman in the 25‚Äì40 age range who is emotionally available, not already in a relationship, doesn‚Äôt want kids of her own but is comfortable being around children, as we have a toddler and plan to have one more. Must be self sufficient as we dont plan on having you move in right away until we get to that bridge. We both love playing games when time permits and do love playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends if given the opportunity. We also play video games such as minecraft!

üë© About Her (35F):

Cottagecore lover and total foodie


Into anime, sewing, tufting, reading, cats, and anything cozy


Loves gardening, and would do more hobbies if time allowed


Morning person through and through; Loves Coffee!


Loves cuddling


Identifies as a bratty sub, open to discovering her dynamic with the right person


Emotionally open, caring, and very nurturing


üë® About Me (38M):

Night owl but flexible; I can match morning energy when needed üòâ


High sex drive, into kink, and would love a partner who is sexually adventurous


Big fan of anime, camping, hiking, gardening, going to the gym, and DIY home upgrades


Handy, protective, and love building things that last.


Emotionally grounded and genuinely invested in creating a warm, balanced lifestyle.



üíï What We're Looking For:

A woman who is kind, emotionally mature, adventurous, kinky, and genuinely interested in building a closed throuple dynamic (just the three of us‚Äîno outside partners)


You should be STD-free, ideally childfree (but okay with kids being part of the picture)


Open to eventually living together (we're open to long-distance for now, as long as the goal is to close that gap)


Someone who is either already into homesteading or finds the idea of building a hobby homestead as a safe haven / retirement dream exciting


Comfortable starting out as friends and growing the connection naturally


We want a relationship that‚Äôs emotionally intimate, and full of laughter, late-night anime marathons, early morning garden harvests, and shared dreams.

* Due to fall break, the schedule for this week is weird -I have Monday off entirely, and the classes that would be on Monday on Tuesday instead, and the rest of the week is normal. So I get comic class at noon two days in a row.

* The deadline for a BIG ASSIGNMENT (two comic pages rough drafts) is due Wednesday by the start of class. This is sooner than I was expecting, so I have not started it -but I thankfully know exactly what I will draw.

* The deadline for two smaller, but much more tedious, assignments, is Tuesday, one by the start of class and the other at midnight. Thankfully it's the former that's easier.

* I have D&D from 7-10 PM Sunday night, and cannot skip it because I have already skipped a previous session in that campaign for homework reasons.

* I have a sleep disorder that, while absolute hell to manage, conveniently allows me to stay up and functional for lengths of time no normal person could manage. Unfortunately, it physically feels miserable to be awake for that long, so I only do this in emergencies -and this is an emergency, I think.

* I am normally better at managing my schoolwork and my ADHD, but recently my ADHD suddenly got a whole lot worse for no reason and so my usual methods of managing it stopped being enough. That's why I'm in this situation in the first place, and why I'm resorting to such drastic measures.

The Difficulty (ADHD)

* Time blindness. If I'm focused, I can lose track of time very easily. I also tend to forget to eat regularly, which will hamper my productivity.

* Understimulation/Boredom. If an assignment is tedious, I will struggle to work on it or make progress. I will also struggle if I get too bored, understimulated or frustrated, or go for too long without a break. I am also very easily distracted for that same reason.

* Hyperfixation. The last few hyperfixations I had were at a normal enough level that I could function as a person. With my current hyperfixation, I got unlucky, and the fixation got so intense it completely consumed my every waking thought. At any point, I am in constant danger of being distracted by either Silksong, my Hollow Knight fanfiction doc, or Ao3. If I choose to entertain myself these ways, I *must* be careful to track time.

My plan so far:

* I plan to fix a sleep schedule screwup and buy myself more time to work by pulling an all-nighter on Sunday night.

* I will also pull an all-nighter on Tuesday night, to buy myself time for the deadline, and because I can't afford to spin the sleep disorder roulette wheel when Wednesday's class is *really important*.

* I will sleep normally on Monday night -I have never been awake for longer than two days, consecutively, and even with my general disregard for my own health, I know that pushing that limit is a *bad idea*.

* I have two fidget toys, music *without ads*, and a sketchbook I can draw in, so understimulation can easily be managed.

* My daytime weekday workspace (the library) has access to comfy chairs next to plugs, and as much coffee or sweet drinks as I need. There's a massage chair, and the atmosphere is calm enough that I can easily nap in the comfy chairs. If I nap to stave off exhaustion, it *has* to be here; if I sleep in my bed I will sleep for far longer than intended.

* My nighttime and weekend workspace (my dorm's rec space) has a piano (for taking breaks and fulfilling ADHD needs), and both access to a very large desk (next to a plug) and access to a comfy chair (also next to a plug). The two-hour access card sign out limit gives me an excuse to go eat something between work sessions.

Does anyone have any other advice for getting through the crunch time and keeping both my ADHD and exhaustion at bay?",3,1760247833.0,college,0,1.0,False

1o4h4s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1o4h4s3/catching_myself_in_real_time_what_growth_actually/,Catching myself in real time: What growth actually looks like for me,"
I‚Äôve been doing therapy for a while now (IFS, Adlerian psychology, CPTSD work), and I thought I‚Äôd share what growth actually looks like in practice. Because it‚Äôs not some zen moment where you‚Äôre suddenly healed and never have problematic impulses again. It‚Äôs catching yourself mid-motion and going ‚Äúoh wait, I know what this is‚Äù and then choosing differently.

Here are three things I almost did this week, and how I caught myself:

1. The approval seeking email I almost sent:

I just finished a big professional qualification and had this whole thank you email drafted to my head of department. It was heartfelt, detailed, and‚Ä¶ completely unnecessary. Nobody asked for it.

Then I caught myself: Why am I sending this? Do I genuinely want to express gratitude, or am I seeking a pat on the head from someone who reminds me of my mother?

Answer: Pat on the head. Definitely pat on the head.

I deleted the draft. If she asks about it (she won‚Äôt), I can thank her then. But I don‚Äôt need to chase approval anymore. Oh, and I also realized part of me wanted to rub it in a little. Which, let‚Äôs be honest, we‚Äôre all capable of that petty satisfaction. The growth isn‚Äôt pretending you‚Äôd never think such things. It‚Äôs acknowledging ‚Äúyep, there‚Äôs that impulse‚Äù and then not acting on it because you don‚Äôt actually need to anymore.

2. The questionnaire results nobody asked for: 

I did a research project for my qualification and some staff at my school participated in a questionnaire. Project‚Äôs done, qualification‚Äôs complete, nobody followed up or asked questions.

My brain: ‚ÄúShould I send them the results? They helped, so maybe I owe them‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then I caught it: Nobody asked. The boss doesn‚Äôt care. This is just me trying to prove the project was worthwhile or performing professionalism for people who aren‚Äôt even paying attention.

3. The great black top crisis of my life: 

I have coffee with someone this weekend (just coffee, very casual, there‚Äôs a picnic after with other people). I caught myself spiraling: ‚ÄúDo I need new clothes? My black sleeveless top is slightly faded. Should I buy new shoes?‚Äù

And then I stopped and laughed at myself because I was literally preparing for a ‚Äúlow key date‚Äù when I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ meeting someone for coffee to see if there‚Äôs anything there.

I started imagining it as a standup bit:

‚ÄúLook, I was really feeling the connection. Your intelligence, your humor, everything. But then I noticed your black sleeveless top was slightly faded and I just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt. The chemistry died right there. If only the fabric had retained its original depth of color, we could have had something special.‚Äù

It‚Äôs ABSURD. And that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm wearing my usual outfit and showing up as myself, comfortable. If chemistry exists, it exists regardless of fabric pigmentation. And if a top changes the outcome, it was never real to begin with.

What I‚Äôve learned:

Growth isn‚Äôt about never having these impulses. It‚Äôs about:

- Catching them faster (used to take me days or weeks, now it‚Äôs minutes)
- Laughing at myself when I notice them
- Choosing differently without guilt or drama
- Trusting that I don‚Äôt need external validation because I‚Äôm already whole

I‚Äôve done more than a year of therapeutic work to get here. And I STILL have moments where my brain tries to pull me back into approval seeking, performance anxiety, or petty revenge fantasies.

The difference is that I see it now. I catch it. And I choose not to engage. That‚Äôs the work. Not perfection. Just faster recognition and better choices.

And honestly? It feels pretty good to catch yourself before you send that unnecessary email or buy clothes you don‚Äôt need for approval you don‚Äôt actually want. :) ",1,1760247807.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

Here is how I am trying again.,"I used to work as an electrical test technician, which was a dream job for me. Losing it because of health issues was hard enough, but I wanted to use the setback to build something new. My idea was a gaming headset that would be less likely to cause hearing loss. I built a prototype, had a manufacturer ready, and was preparing to launch on Kickstarter.

Then the tariffs hit. Overnight my costs made no sense. I had to shut it down before I could even show it to the world. Years of work and hope were gone in an instant.

That was one of the hardest things I have ever gone through. I was depressed and anxious, but I still could not bring myself to quit. I decided that if I could not launch the headset, I would still find a way to create something valuable.

Now I publish eBooks on the history of coffee, tea, and chocolate, on philosophy, and on the real costs of tariffs and policies. I pair them with coffee and tea orders, giving the eBooks away for free so that people get something extra to think about along with something they already enjoy. It is not the dream I started with, but it is a path I can walk right now.

Some days it feels like I am climbing uphill without end, but I know I am not the only one who has been knocked down by events beyond control. I wanted to share this because I think a lot of people in small business have been there too.

I totally understand the pressure on the housing and healthcare markets that has led to this.  I get it; I completely do and wholeheartedly support measures to tighten the system, and in fact, more crackdown is badly needed. 

But it's so heart-wrenching and downright disappointing to see this once-meritocratic system that now has no pathway even for PhD graduates who've contributed to teaching and high quality research for several years and who have graduated with highly skilled jobs who are now being kicked out, all while simultaneously providing unfettered 3 WHOLE YEARS of open work permit access to diplomas and certificates from shopping mall colleges that have no entry requirements for admission whatsoever.  

The policy still continues to treat rigorous graduate level education that have stringent and competitive admissions criteria and which are funded by the system with graduate degree holders contributing so much - which is treated the same as no-barrier-to-entry diplomas and certificates that abuse the system and produce frankly unskilled and unqualified low wage labour, who crowd out the entry level job market in grocery stores and coffee shops across the country.

I am a 26F who is married and I have one child. I love the gospel and I want to be worthy for the temple but I‚Äôve been struggling with so many things. 

In my past I struggled with Porn, Nicotine, weed and alcohol. My only addictions have really been nicotine and caffeine, though. I live 2 hours from the temple and it‚Äôs a whole thing to try and go. I had been preparing to go for a month and 2 weeks ago I saw porn and I caved. I will admit I was kind of looking for it and I know it‚Äôs because Satan has been working so dog gone hard on me let me tell you. I told my husband and he wasn‚Äôt upset or disappointed. He‚Äôs such a gem. I felt so bad and I wad pleading to HF to forgive me so I could be clean again. 

My problem is I don‚Äôt feel clean. I was supposed to go to the temple today and I felt so much anxiety and the words ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not worthy‚Äù kept coming into my head. I took that as the spirit telling me I‚Äôm not supposed to go. In the past ive gone to the bishop for sins like this but it‚Äôs never sat right with me. I honestly don‚Äôt think I can bring myself to go to the bishop because I hate that concept. Why should I need to tell a MAN that‚Äôs not my husband that I watched porn and masturbated? 

I told my husband, I prayed, I haven‚Äôt taken the sacrament for a while so why don‚Äôt i feel clean? That leads me to another reason I may not feel/be worthy. I drink coffee every day. It‚Äôs so comforting to me in the morning and it‚Äôs definitely a crutch as well. I probably have around 300-400 mg of caffeine a day. I know I need to cut down and I‚Äôm working on it but does that mean I‚Äôm not worthy to go to the temple? 

There are some people that only drink energy drinks or soda and they still go. What do I need to do? Where do I find straight up answers? Where do I get a step by step instruction on what‚Äôs okay and what‚Äôs not? How do I actually move forward? Does anyone else struggle in the same ways I do? When i look at it in the big scheme of things, I am a good person, a good mom, a loving wife and I love Jesus and I pray everyday and I try my best. Why don‚Äôt I feel worthy?

Currently sat trying to fend off 'pre-match' nerves.

Have had my morning coffee, peanut butter on toast.

After starting to run in May for fitness, deciding to run a half in June it's now here. I have use the NRC all the way through my journey - some great motivational runs on there throughout my journey which kept it structured and fun starting and then progressing into a training block 

Have had great support from friends and family and raised over ¬£400 for my chosen charity.

Now to complete the half. 

First goal is to complete it without walking, second goal is to come in under 2 hours.

Will update this post to say if those goals were completed and if they're not then I'm just glad to be out running along the beautiful Dorset coastline in October.

That alone was devastating. But instead of giving up, I poured myself into something I had wanted to do for years, designing a gaming headset that would actually protect hearing.

I built the prototype, lined up a manufacturer, and prepared for Kickstarter. Then the tariffs hit. Overnight, the numbers made no sense. I had to pull the plug before even launching. Years of hope and work vanished with a signature on paper.

It broke me for a while. Depression, anxiety, all of it. But as much as I wanted to quit, I could not. I had to rebuild.

So I changed direction. If I could not sell the headset, I would still fight the policies that wrecked it. I began writing and publishing eBooks about coffee, tea, chocolate, history, philosophy, and the dangers of tariffs. I wanted people to see how policies that sound protective actually destroy small businesses and crush dreamers like me.

Now I give those eBooks away with every bag of coffee and tea I sell. Because that is what I can do right now. Keep going. Keep creating. Keep telling the truth, even if the odds are stacked against me.

It is not the dream I started with, but it is a dream worth building. Every day I try to turn anger into action, setbacks into fuel, and loss into something that helps others.

If you have ever had your plans wrecked by politics, policy, or even just bad luck, you know how much it hurts. I am not here to complain. I am here to prove that you can get knocked down and still stand up again.

I would love to hear how others fought through their own storms. And if you are curious about what I am building now, reach out. I am always glad to share more.

1o4gtth,https://i.redd.it/iho4s5y59muf1.jpeg,Il caff√® falsi viti viaggi realt√†,"Perfetto. Il Capitolo 1 si √® concentrato su miti relativi al gusto e alla preparazione (espresso, ristretto, pulizia moka). Il Capitolo 2 pu√≤ trattare i miti sulla conservazione e quelli legati alla percezione della qualit√† e alla salute.
Il Caff√®: Falsi Miti, Viaggi e Realt√†
Capitolo 2: La Freschezza Rubata e le Illusioni di Qualit√†
Dopo aver smantellato le credenze pi√π comuni sul gusto e l'estrazione, √® tempo di affrontare i miti che riguardano la conservazione del caff√® e le scorciatoie che usiamo per giudicarne la qualit√†. Il caff√®, in grani o macinato, √® un alimento che respira, invecchia e assorbe l'ambiente circostante: sapere come trattarlo √® essenziale per preservare i suoi preziosi aromi, il frutto di un lungo viaggio.
2.1 Falso Mito: ""Il Caff√® va Conservato in Frigorifero""
La Realt√†: Questo √® probabilmente l'errore domestico pi√π diffuso in buona fede. La logica √® semplice: gli alimenti freschi si conservano in frigorifero. Per il caff√®, purtroppo, questa pratica √® controproducente e dannosa.
Perch√© √® Sbagliato: Il caff√® √® igroscopico, una parola che significa che ha la tendenza ad assorbire l'umidit√† e gli odori circostanti. Il frigorifero √® un luogo notoriamente:
 * Umidit√†: L'umidit√† interna provoca la formazione di condensa sul caff√® (sia esso macinato o in grani) ogni volta che lo si tira fuori e lo si rimette dentro. L'acqua altera la struttura chimica del caff√® e ne accelera il deterioramento.
 * Odori: La miscela assorbe gli odori forti dei cibi conservati in frigo (formaggi, salumi, verdure), rovinandone il profilo aromatico in modo irrimediabile.
La Verit√†: Il caff√® teme quattro nemici: aria, luce, calore e umidit√†. La corretta conservazione avviene in un contenitore ermetico, riposto in un luogo fresco e asciutto (come una dispensa chiusa), lontano da fonti di calore (forno, fornelli) e dalla luce diretta. Per gli amanti del caff√®, la regola d'oro √®: comprare chicchi interi (che si ossidano pi√π lentamente del macinato) e macinarli poco prima dell'uso.
2.2 Falso Mito: ""Se lo Zucchero Galleggia, il Caff√® √® Buono""
La Realt√†: Questa convinzione √® strettamente legata all'espresso da bar. Si crede che una crema cos√¨ spessa e resistente da sostenere il peso dello zucchero per qualche secondo sia un segno inequivocabile di alta qualit√†.
Perch√© √® Sbagliato: La ""crema"" sulla superficie dell'espresso √® una fondamentale emulsione di oli, zuccheri e gas (anidride carbonica) che viene prodotta dalla pressione della macchina. Una crema troppo scura, eccessivamente densa o che non si rompe √® spesso l'indicatore di difetti piuttosto che di pregio:
 * Crema troppo scura: Indica chicchi bruciati o una sovra-estrazione, che porta in tazza l'amaro.
 * Crema eccessiva o ""spessa come il miele"": Pu√≤ essere sintomo di un'alta percentuale di Robusta nella miscela (una variet√† che produce pi√π crema ma √® meno aromatica dell'Arabica) o, nel peggiore dei casi, di l'aggiunta di additivi.
La Verit√†: La crema di un buon espresso deve avere un colore nocciola tigrato e una consistenza elastica, che si ricomponga leggermente quando mescolata. Non deve essere troppo schiumosa. La sua tenuta non √® un indicatore di qualit√† quanto piuttosto della freschezza del caff√® e della correttezza dell'estrazione. Lasciare cadere lo zucchero √® un gioco innocuo, ma non un test di qualit√†.
2.3 Falso Mito: ""Il Caff√® fa Male allo Stomaco""
La Realt√†: Molte persone evitano o limitano il caff√®, convinte che la bevanda sia intrinsecamente dannosa per il sistema digestivo, causando acidit√† o bruciore.
Perch√© √® Sbagliato: Il caff√® di per s√©, se di buona qualit√†, non √® un veleno per lo stomaco. La sensazione di ""pesantezza"" o acidit√† fastidiosa √® quasi sempre dovuta a difetti di produzione:
 * Caff√® di bassa qualit√†: Contiene sostanze indesiderate che non vengono rimosse durante la lavorazione.
 * Tostatura scurissima/bruciata: I chicchi carbonizzati sono pi√π irritanti.
 * Variet√† Robusta: Le miscele ad alta percentuale di Robusta sono generalmente pi√π astringenti e dure.
La Verit√†: Un caff√® Arabica di alta qualit√†, con una tostatura media o chiara, correttamente estratto, ha una componente acida che √® piacevole (come quella della frutta) e non irritante. Per coloro che hanno sensibilit√† gastrica, la chiave √® scegliere un caff√® con un'ottima materia prima e una tostatura ottimizzata. Inoltre, √® sempre meglio consumare il caff√® a stomaco pieno per mitigare l'effetto stimolante della caffeina sulla secrezione di acidi gastrici.

Il Caff√®: Falsi Miti, Viaggi e Realt√†
Capitolo 3: Il Grande Viaggio ‚Äì Origini, Variet√† e la Geopolitica del Chicco
Dopo aver smascherato i miti che circondano la tazzina, √® tempo di espandere i nostri orizzonti e intraprendere il vero e proprio viaggio del caff√®. Ogni chicco che finisce nella vostra moka o nel filtro di un espresso ha percorso migliaia di chilometri e superato una complessa serie di trasformazioni. Comprendere l'origine e la variet√† del caff√® non √® un esercizio accademico, ma la chiave per capire cosa stiamo bevendo e perch√© alcuni sapori sono diversi da quelli a cui siamo abituati.
3.1 La Culla: Dall'Etiopia ai Tropici
La storia del caff√® inizia, secondo la leggenda, in Etiopia, dove un pastore di nome Kaldi not√≤ le sue capre particolarmente energiche dopo aver mangiato le bacche rosse di una certa pianta. Da l√¨, il caff√® si diffuse nello Yemen (nella Penisola Arabica), dove i chicchi furono tostati e macinati per la prima volta per creare la bevanda che conosciamo oggi.
Oggi, il caff√® cresce in quella che viene chiamata la ""Cintura del Caff√®"" (Coffee Belt), una fascia che circonda l'equatore, tra il Tropico del Cancro e il Tropico del Capricorno. Questa geografia definisce il clima ideale: alta umidit√†, temperature stabili e, spesso, altitudini elevate. Ogni regione ‚Äì dall'America Latina all'Africa all'Asia ‚Äì conferisce al chicco caratteristiche organolettiche uniche, proprio come il terroir per il vino.
3.2 Le Due Regine: Arabica e Robusta
Se parliamo di caff√®, √® impossibile non affrontare la distinzione fondamentale tra le due specie pi√π coltivate a livello commerciale: la Coffea Arabica e la Coffea Canephora (pi√π nota come Robusta).
3.2.1 Coffea Arabica: L'Eleganza Aromatizzata
 * Produzione Globale: Circa il 60-70% del mercato mondiale.
 * Coltivazione: Predilige le alte quote (600-2000 metri) e climi miti. √à una pianta delicata, suscettibile alle malattie, e la sua coltivazione √® pi√π costosa.
 * Caratteristiche del Chicco: Allungato, con un solco ondulato.
 * Gusto e Aroma: √à la variet√† pi√π pregiata. Offre un profilo aromatico complesso e delicato, con note che spaziano dal fruttato al floreale, dal cioccolato al caramello. Presenta una piacevole acidit√† e una minore amarezza naturale.
 * Caffeina: Bassa, circa l'1.0% - 1.7%.
3.2.2 Coffea Robusta: Forza e Corpo
 * Produzione Globale: Circa il 30-40% del mercato mondiale.
 * Coltivazione: Cresce a quote pi√π basse, in climi pi√π caldi e umidi. √à una pianta ""robusta"" e resistente, meno costosa da coltivare.
 * Caratteristiche del Chicco: Pi√π rotondo e piccolo, con un solco dritto.
 * Gusto e Aroma: Pi√π forte, amaro e meno aromatico. Spesso presenta note terrose o di legno. √à apprezzata per il suo corpo (la sensazione tattile in bocca) e per la crema densa che produce nell'espresso.
 * Caffeina: Alta, circa il 2.5% - 4.5%.
La maggior parte delle miscele di caff√® italiano utilizza una combinazione di entrambe le variet√† per bilanciare l'aroma dell'Arabica con la forza, il corpo e la cremosit√† della Robusta. La realt√†, spesso, √® che il gusto ""amaro"" che molti associano all'espresso √® in gran parte dovuto proprio all'alta percentuale di Robusta, combinata con una tostatura troppo scura.
3.3 Dalla Bacca al Chicco Verde: La Lavorazione
Il chicco di caff√® √® in realt√† il seme di una bacca (chiamata ciliegia) che cresce sull'albero. Per liberare il chicco, la polpa esterna deve essere rimossa, un processo che avviene attraverso due metodi principali che influenzano drammaticamente il gusto finale:
 * Metodo Naturale (a secco): Le ciliegie intere vengono essiccate al sole su grandi letti. La polpa essiccata rilascia i suoi zuccheri e sapori al chicco interno. Produce caff√® con un corpo pieno e un sapore pi√π dolce e fruttato. Comune in Brasile ed Etiopia.
 * Metodo Lavato (a umido): La polpa viene rimossa quasi subito con l'acqua, prima che il chicco venga essiccato. Questo produce un caff√® pi√π pulito, con una maggiore acidit√† e una definizione aromatica pi√π chiara. Comune in America Centrale e in alcune parti dell'Africa.
Solo dopo questo lungo viaggio agricolo e di lavorazione, il chicco di caff√®, ora di colore verde, √® pronto per l'ultima, cruciale trasformazione: la tostatura.Il Caff√®: Falsi Miti, Viaggi e Realt√†
Capitolo 4: L'Alchimia Finale ‚Äì La Tostatura e la Rivelazione del Gusto
Il chicco di caff√® verde, dopo aver viaggiato dalle piantagioni ed essere stato lavorato (sezione 3.3), √® ancora inodore e insapore. Il passaggio pi√π cruciale e magico dell'intera filiera √® la tostatura (o torrefazione), il processo alchemico che trasforma i semi duri e verdi nel chicco marrone e fragrante che tutti conosciamo.
La tostatura √® l'arte che determina se il vostro caff√® sar√† dolce, amaro, acido, corposo, o una combinazione equilibrata di tutti questi elementi.
4.1 La Trasformazione: Arte, Scienza e Maillard
La tostatura √® un processo termico in cui i chicchi di caff√® vengono riscaldati in grandi tamburi rotanti (tostatrici) a temperature che possono superare i 200^\circ\text{C}. Durante questo processo avvengono migliaia di reazioni chimiche complesse, tra cui due fondamentali:
 * Reazione di Maillard: La reazione chimica tra gli zuccheri e gli aminoacidi presenti nel chicco. √à la stessa che d√† al pane la sua crosta dorata e alla carne il suo sapore umami. Nella tostatura, √® responsabile della creazione della maggior parte dei composti aromatici che percepiamo (note di cioccolato, caramello, nocciola).
 * Caramellizzazione: La decomposizione degli zuccheri sotto l'effetto del calore, che contribuisce al colore marrone scuro e al gusto agrodolce del caff√®.
Durante la tostatura, i chicchi perdono umidit√†, aumentano di volume (fino al 60%) e, soprattutto, subiscono il ""crack"": un crepitio udibile, simile a quello dei popcorn, che indica il rilascio di gas e la fine della fase di asciugatura.
4.2 I Gradi di Tostatura: La Scala del Sapore
L'abilit√† del tostatore risiede nel trovare il ""profilo"" perfetto, gestendo tempo e temperatura per massimizzare gli aromi desiderati di una specifica variet√†. Le tostature si classificano generalmente in tre categorie principali:
| Grado di Tostatura | Colore Chicco | Profilo Aromatico Dominante | Uso Ideale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chiara (Light Roast) | Marrone chiaro, opaco | Acidit√† vivace, note floreali e fruttate. Massimo mantenimento degli aromi di origine. | Caff√® filtro, Chemex, V60. |
| Media (Medium Roast) | Marrone medio, senza olio | Equilibrio tra dolcezza, acidit√† e amarezza. Note di nocciola e cioccolato. Tostatura prediletta per Specialty Coffee. | Espresso moderno, Moka. |
| Scura (Dark Roast) | Marrone scuro, spesso oleoso | Amarezza predominante, basso livello di acidit√†. Gusto ""robusto"" e forte, con note tostate/affumicate. | Espresso tradizionale italiano. |
Un Falso Mito Smascherato (di nuovo): Molti credono che la tostatura scura sia sinonimo di forza e qualit√†. In realt√†, una tostatura molto scura viene spesso usata per caff√® di bassa qualit√† per mascherare i difetti intrinseci della materia prima, bruciando via qualsiasi nota aromatica complessa in favore di una semplice amarezza.
4.3 Il Riposo e la Macinatura: La Freschezza √® Tutto
Una volta tostati, i chicchi devono essere raffreddati rapidamente (di solito con aria) per bloccare la cottura. A questo punto, inizia un altro processo cruciale: il rilascio di anidride carbonica (CO2).
 * Il Riposo (Degassing): Il caff√® appena tostato √® pieno di \text{CO}_2. Se usato subito per l'espresso, il gas in eccesso interferisce con l'estrazione. I chicchi vengono lasciati ""riposare"" per un periodo che va dalle 48 ore a circa 10 giorni, a seconda della tostatura e del metodo di preparazione.
 * La Macinatura (Granulometria): Questo √® l'ultimo anello della catena prima dell'estrazione, e uno dei pi√π importanti per il consumatore finale. La dimensione delle particelle macinate deve essere perfettamente adattata al metodo di estrazione scelto:
| Metodo di Estrazione | Macinatura Ideale |
|---|---|
| Espresso | Finissima (come farina) |
| Moka | Media (pi√π fine del sale grosso) |
| Caff√® Filtro (V60) | Media/Grossolana (come sale grosso) |
| French Press | Grossolana (come pangrattato) |
Una macinatura errata (troppo grossa o troppo fine) porta a un'estrazione non ottimale: il caff√® risulta acido e debole (sotto-estratto) o, al contrario, amaro e astringente (sovra-estratto). L'acquisto del caff√® in grani e la macinatura al momento sono il segreto per sconfiggere i falsi miti e bere finalmente un caff√® nel pieno della sua freschezza.
(Il Capitolo 5 potr√† affrontare i metodi di estrazione moderni e la degustazione consapevole, concludendo il percorso pratico per il consumatore.)
Il Caff√®: Falsi Miti, Viaggi e Realt√†
Capitolo 5: L'Ultimo Passo ‚Äì Metodi di Estrazione e Degustazione Consapevole
Siamo giunti alla fase finale del viaggio: l'estrazione. Qui si compie la magia, trasformando la polvere tostata in bevanda. Sebbene l'espresso e la Moka dominino la cultura italiana, il mondo offre una variet√† di metodi che esaltano profili aromatici diversi. Comprendere questi metodi √® il passo finale per diventare un consumatore di caff√® consapevole.
5.1 Espresso vs. Moka: Le Due Anime Italiane
La stragrande maggioranza del consumo italiano √® divisa tra due metodi, che producono bevande fondamentalmente diverse:
5.1.1 L'Espresso (Alta Pressione)
 * Principio: L'acqua calda (circa 90-96^\circ\text{C}) viene spinta ad alta pressione (circa 9 bar) attraverso un ""panetto"" di caff√® macinato finissimo e compattato.
 * Risultato: Una bevanda concentrata, voluminosa e densa, caratterizzata dalla crema (l'emulsione di oli e gas). L'alta pressione estrae rapidamente sia i sapori dolci che quelli amari, dando il massimo corpo e intensit√†.
 * Sfida: Richiede macinatura precisissima e attrezzatura professionale per un risultato ottimale.
5.1.2 La Moka (Bassa Pressione)
 * Principio: L'acqua nel bollitore viene riscaldata, creando vapore. Questo vapore genera una pressione molto bassa (circa 1-2 bar) che spinge l'acqua attraverso il caff√® macinato.
 * Risultato: Un caff√® percolatore (non un espresso) con meno corpo e senza la crema tipica. L'acqua, risalendo a temperature molto elevate (spesso sopra il punto di ebollizione), pu√≤ facilmente sovra-estrarre il caff√®, enfatizzando l'amaro e i sapori bruciati.
 * Miglioramento Pratico: Usare acqua calda nel bollitore, spegnere la fiamma appena il caff√® inizia a gorgogliare e mescolare prima di servire aiuta a mitigare la sovra-estrazione e il sapore di bruciato.
5.2 L'Arte della Lentezza: I Metodi Filtro (Brewing)
I metodi filtro, sebbene meno diffusi in Italia, sono fondamentali per assaporare la complessit√† aromatica dei caff√® Specialty (specialmente le Arabica a tostatura chiara). Si basano sulla percolazione lenta, che richiede macinature pi√π grossolane:
| Metodo | Principio di Estrazione | Profilo della Tazza |
|---|---|---|
| French Press | Infusione totale: il caff√® macinato resta in acqua calda (non bollente) per circa 4 minuti, poi viene separato da un filtro a maglia metallica. | Corpo pieno e oleoso, gusto intenso e rotondo. |
| V60 / Chemex | Pour-Over (percolazione manuale): l'acqua calda viene versata lentamente sul caff√® macinato in un filtro di carta. | Corpo leggero, pulizia in tazza eccezionale. Esalta acidit√† e note fruttate/floreali. |
| Cold Brew | Macerazione a freddo: il caff√® macinato resta in infusione in acqua fredda per 12-24 ore. | Bassa acidit√† e bassa amarezza. Gusto naturalmente dolce, concentrato, ideale per bevande estive. |
La Chiave del Filtro: Questi metodi richiedono un'attenzione meticolosa a tutti i parametri:
 * Acqua: Deve essere pura e alla giusta temperatura (92-96^\circ\text{C}).
 * Rapporto: Mantenere la proporzione corretta tra acqua e caff√® (spesso 60 \text{g} di caff√® per litro d'acqua).
 * Tempo: Ogni metodo ha un tempo di contatto ideale per evitare la sotto o sovra-estrazione.
5.3 La Degustazione Consapevole: Oltre il Gulp
Per concludere il percorso, dobbiamo imparare ad apprezzare il caff√® per quello che √®: una bevanda complessa e sensoriale. Il vero intenditore va oltre il semplice ""buono o cattivo"" e si concentra su quattro pilastri della degustazione:
 * Aroma (Olfatto): Il primo e pi√π importante senso. Subito dopo la preparazione, annusate il profumo. Potete distinguere note di cioccolato, caramello, spezie, agrumi o fiori? La ricchezza dell'aroma √® un indice diretto della qualit√† del chicco e della tostatura.
 * Corpo (Tatto): La sensazione tattile del caff√® in bocca. √à leggero (come il t√®), medio o pieno (come il latte intero)? Il corpo √® determinato da oli e solidi sospesi.
 * Acidit√† (Gusto): L'acidit√† non √® un difetto (come l'amaro); √® una caratteristica che d√† vivacit√† e freschezza. Nei caff√® di alta qualit√†, l'acidit√† √® percepita come gradevole, simile a quella del limone o del pompelmo. Un caff√® senza acidit√† √® spesso piatto e noioso.
 * Amarezza (Gusto e Retrogusto): L'amaro √® una parte naturale del caff√®, ma deve essere gradevole. Un'amarezza eccessiva (come quella della cenere o del medicinale) √® quasi sempre il risultato di una tostatura troppo scura o di una sovra-estrazione.
La Conclusione:
Dopo aver sviscerato falsi miti e svelato le complessit√† del caff√®, l'obiettivo non √® demonizzare l'espresso o la Moka, ma elevare il livello di consapevolezza. Ogni tazza, dal bar alla cucina, nasconde il lavoro di agricoltori, torrefattori e la scienza dell'estrazione.
Il passo finale √® dunque: scegliete il vostro caff√® in modo consapevole. Concentratevi sulla freschezza, chiedete l'origine e la tostatura, regolate la macinatura. In questo modo, trasformerete il vostro rito quotidiano da un semplice sorso di caffeina in un'autentica e ricca esperienza sensoriale.

She jumps onto the counter when I make my coffee, asking for chin and belly rubs like it‚Äôs her little morning ritual. And then, after all that attention, she just walks off and spends the rest of her day doing her own thing. The next morning, she‚Äôs back again same routine, same quiet, purring companionship.

Only found out about this sub on day 4 also lol, when I did, I started to read a lot of posts).

Disclaimer: I did what my dentist told me. This report is not meant as an example of what to do - it's simply meant to show how my process was so that you can see an example of how it goes.

If you have any important questions, ask your dentist. They'll know much more about it than anybody in this sub.

  
**Removal day** \- I removed my lower right wisdom tooth. I felt no pain, but it was impacted, and the dentist said it'd be better to remove it before it started infecting.

Dentist recommended I have lunch before and not to go on an empty stomach.

The surgery was painless due to local anesthesia. It only started hurting around 2h after the surgery when the anesthesia started to wear off.

My cheek got big and painful, nothing unexpected.

The dentist recommended antibiotics for 3 days, anti-inflammatory med for 4 days initially or until the swelling was greatly reduced, and pain meds every 6h as long as I needed them.

The swelling hurt more than the affected gum. 

After some time, I couldn't open my mouth that much due to the swelling.

Spent the day with ice on my cheek; it helped with the pain. Just be careful not to press your cheek too much.

Only had ice cream and soup as meals.

Dentist said no swishing at all, no chewing on that side, no brushing the gum. After I brushed my teeth, I'd gently tilt my head to the left and right to get the toothpaste off. It hurt.

He also told me on that day to lie down only to sleep at night.

No exercising for the week.

  
**Day 1** \- Lots of swelling, no blood in my mouth or pain through the day, weirdly enough. Had mashed potatoes for lunch. Eating was extremely slow because I couldn't open my mouth too much, because I tried to chew with my tongue, and because it hurt.

Ice cream in the afternoon. Put ice on my cheek as much as I could (it's tiring sometimes because you can't do much with only a single hand available)

I was so hungry that I decided I'd make some really soft scrambled eggs for dinner (I hate soup). I tried to chew with my tongue more than with my mouth.

My mouth started to hurt considerably after that effort, which made me think I should have waited another day.

  
**Day 2** \- Even more swelling, my cheek was really big. I realized that the swelling was more intense when I woke up because of lying down. 

A really bad thing happened - due to the swelling, when I slept, I slept biting my inner cheek and took a piece out (I only found out about this on my 7th day appointment). My cheek started to hurt a lot, much more than the gum. I usually don't complain much about pain, so even though it hurt a lot, I just moved on (maybe I should have told the dentist). Bad thing is I had to keep my mouth open (closed lips tho) so my cheek wouldn't hurt. 

I started to feel blood in my mouth. Not lots of it, it wasn't dripping for sure, but I would feel a salty, warm taste in my saliva.

Had fish for lunch. Yogurt in the afternoon. Noodles for dinner (with butter only, no seasoning, as I was afraid it'd irritate my gums). I was still really hungry overall.

At night, the bleeding increased a bit. Dentist had advised me to bite a wet gauze without too much pressure to stop the bleeding. It helped, but didn't stop it.

Also, the meds made me feel like peeing a lot more. Sometimes I'd wake up desperate to pee lol.

**Day 3** \- Peak swelling when I woke up. Dentist assured me it was normal, that the swelling is usually at its peak on the 3rd day.

In the afternoon, the swelling finally started to reduce. The blood in my saliva started to turn brown, which made me more comfortable as I could see it was ""old"" blood.

Had rice and eggs for lunch, yogurt in the afternoon, and bread (really soft), ham, and cheese for dinner. It was still hard to open my mouth, so I would take a small chunk at a time.

Still applying ice to the cheek.

**Day 4 -** From this moment onwards, every day I woke up, there would be less swelling than the previous day. Pain was also reducing, although the pain on my cheek was still considerable.

Had cake in the morning because I was very hungry, really soft cake.

Rice and mince for lunch, cake in the afternoon, scrambled eggs for dinner.

I would still feel the brown fluid in my saliva. No fresh blood, thankfully.

Still hard to open my mouth, but slowly improving.

Found this sub. Got very scared of dry socket LOL. Dentist told me about it, that a blood clot needed to form, but I wasn't too worried about a dry socket until I opened this sub. So be careful - I see a lot of people here asking about dry socket and panicking, yet I see that 99% of the people in the sub didn't have it. So don't panic, just follow your dentist's advice and you'll be fine.

**Day 5** \- Swelling kept reducing. Brown fluid still in my saliva, at which I started to get a bit concerned, because it was the 5th day already, although it was reducing. Also started to notice my breath was bad LOL, because I couldn't brush the wound, and I was afraid to go too deep and hurt it. 

First coffee cup! Of course, I had to wait until it was warm, not hot, and I was very careful not to let it into the wound.

Reduced icing frequency on the cheek because at this point the pain was better and the swelling was going down, and I was tired of applying ice to it lol.

Rice, beans, and fish for lunch. Coffee and cake in the afternoon. Dinner was the same as lunch.

Cheek pain was better, but it still spiked when water touched it after brushing my teeth.

A yellow trail formed from my cheek down to my neck (still present). My skin is very pale, and the dentist told me that this could happen due to the blood draining in my body.

**Day 6** \- Swelling reduced greatly. Brown fluid still in my saliva, although less than before.

At this point, I was not eating any hard foods, but I stopped avoiding things. I had scrambled eggs, rice and beans for dinner, coffee and cake in the afternoon, and pizza at night (lol). I made sure to pick only cheese as a topping.

**Day 7** \- Stitches removal day! I was so happy and excited to get rid of the stitches and to be able to eat normal food again, and also anxious to see if anything went wrong.

Dentist checked it, said the healing was going well - blood clot formed and there was already scar tissue, which meant there was pretty much no more danger of a dry socket, and that I could eat anything - as long as it wasn't on the wound. She saw the cheek bite and was terrified - she said ""you must have felt a lot of pain, you pretty much took a chunk from your cheek"" lol. Indeed, the strongest pain was in my cheek for those days.

She said there was quite a bit of plaque in my back tooth, the one next to the hole, and that was probably causing pain, too. I was afraid to hurt the gum while it was healing, so I didn't go deep enough.

She told me to brush it and that the brown fluid and the pain would go away pretty fast.

She removed the stitches and gave me some new procedures for the next 1 - 2 weeks. From that point on, she said I could swish without any restrictions, and she told me to splash the hole with a syringe after I brushed my teeth to remove any food remains. Also recommended a mouthwash twice a day to help with keeping the hole clean.

She told me to see her again in 1 - 2 weeks to see if everything was going well, but that the healing was going well and that I shouldn't have any issues.

It felt SO GOOD to have a proper brushing and swishing and flossing (couldn't do it before because my mouth wouldn't open too much). My mouth finally felt clean, and the bad breath was greatly reduced.

Just as she said, the brown fluid, bad breath, and pain reduced after taking these steps.

I had a burger with fries for lunch and soda LOL. Also had coffee and cake in the afternoon. Had nuggets and fries for dinner. Life is good.

**Day 8 (today) -** The only thing that remains is a little swelling, I am sure it will go away with time.

My mouth still doesn't open fully, although it does almost. I will look for some exercise to get it back to normal.

I'm still following the oral hygiene routine, and I don't feel the brown fluid at all, and my breath is fully back to normal, with no pain at all. 

I even had popcorn today, and although I'm chewing on the unaffected side, the other side feels a bit of strain because I haven't chewed anything hard in a week, but it's all good.

So, in summary: 

\- Follow your dentist's advice, and you should be fine.

\- Keep a strong oral hygiene;

\- Don't panic about a dry socket. From what I read, you'll know easily if you have it. And if you are afraid of it, ask your dentist.

\- If you have any questions, ask your dentist first of all, and schedule an appointment if you feel you need to.

\- It's a bad and frustrating period, but do everything right and have faith, and in no time you'll be free from it. When you are free to eat anything again, you'll feel a lot of joy as I did lol.

If you have any further questions about my journey, ask in the comments, and I'll try to answer. I probably forgot some stuff, but I tried to be as detailed as I could remember.

1o4gi2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o4gi2g/kids_cove/,Kids Cove,"The air off Lake Michigan tasted the same. Cold, metallic, like rainwater and rust.

Eli hadn‚Äôt been home in ten years, not since the night that split his life in two ‚Äî before prison and after. The houses on Harbor Street still leaned into the wind the same way, like tired old men. A few porch lights glowed dimly through the fog, the kind of yellow that didn‚Äôt light anything, just made the dark deeper.

He walked with his hands in his coat pockets, collar up, the sound of his boots wet against the pavement. He told himself he just wanted air, but truthfully he couldn‚Äôt sleep. The walls of his mother‚Äôs house felt too close, too quiet.

When he reached the corner, he saw the old sign.

KIDS COVE PARK.
A grinning cartoon pirate with one eye missing, the paint cracked and peeling.

The playground had been the heartbeat of the neighborhood when Eli was a kid. A sprawling wooden fortress shaped like a ship ‚Äî rope bridges, towers, a lookout post facing the lake. He used to play there until the streetlights came on, until his mother‚Äôs voice called him home.

Now it stood like a carcass under the sodium lights, the wood dark and slick with dew.

He almost walked past it. Almost.

But then he saw it.

Someone ‚Äî or something ‚Äî was standing in the middle of the playground.


At first, he thought it was a trick of the light. The fog shifted, the lampposts hummed, and the shadows bent strange in the mist. But this wasn‚Äôt bending. It was watching.

The figure stood near the ship‚Äôs bow ‚Äî tall, motionless, darker than the night around it. Eli stopped dead, every instinct from prison screaming don‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù he called out. His voice carried across the park, small against the wind. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

No answer.

He squinted. The figure wasn‚Äôt moving, but its head ‚Äî its head was tilted, just slightly. Like it was curious. Like it recognized him.

Eli felt a cold pulse behind his ribs.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he said, trying to sound steady. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be out here, okay? Park‚Äôs closed.‚Äù

Still nothing.

He stepped off the curb, boots crunching on frost. The closer he got, the stranger it looked ‚Äî like the shadow wasn‚Äôt cast by anything. It just was. A patch of darker dark.

And then Jasper ‚Äî his mother‚Äôs old neighbor‚Äôs mutt ‚Äî barked somewhere down the street.

The shadow turned its head.

That tiny motion broke him. He stumbled back, his heel catching the curb. When he looked again ‚Äî it was gone.

Just fog. Just the creak of wood shifting in the cold.


He told himself it was his imagination. Years in concrete, bad lighting, worse memories ‚Äî that kind of thing plays tricks on you.

But when he got home and turned on the porch light, he saw it again. Not in the yard, not in the street ‚Äî in the reflection of the storm door behind him.

A tall, crooked shape standing where he‚Äôd just been. Watching.

He spun around, heart slamming against his ribs ‚Äî nothing. Just the night, the wind through dead leaves.

He locked the door, double-bolted it.

In the morning, he tried to laugh it off. His mother made coffee, said how good it was to have him home, how he should go see the lake in the daylight.

He didn‚Äôt mention the playground.

That night, though, he couldn‚Äôt help himself. From his window, he could see the faint outline of Kids Cove at the end of the street. The fog had rolled in thick again, swallowing everything but the playground‚Äôs silhouette.

And there, right by the pirate ship‚Äôs bow ‚Äî he saw movement.

A shape. Standing. Tilting its head.

This time, it was waving.

They found his footprints the next morning ‚Äî they led straight from his mother‚Äôs porch to the playground.

They ended at the edge of the ship‚Äôs shadow, where the frost was disturbed.

But no one ever found Eli.

When kids play at Kids Cove now, some say they see a tall shape standing near the ship, watching over them from the fog.

The younger ones wave at it.

Sometimes, it waves back.

 I went to a food truck to get lunch for my grandpa whose in rehab, and the window person recognized me from the store I used to work at. We chatted for a bit, mentioned that I gave him a trans bracelet for free, and he said he forgot that he was working which blew my mind. A 10/10 was getting distracted by me and looking at me like ryan reynolds looks at hugh jackman. I remembered I found some of the bracelets in my console the other day, so I fished it out and gave it to them when my food was ready. I was so nervous afterwards, I couldn't finish the salad I ordered. 


The next day, she was like,""oh, you're back. Must have been good."" To which I said I had to support businesses with rainbow stickers and gestured at my wrist because of the bracelet she was still wearing. Asked for my pronouns, and mentioned she was cool with anything for hers. I asked if she wanted my number when I came back for my food (and to dump my purse change into the tip jar) and she said yes. 


This morning she called me before heading to work. Said that their phone wasn't texting for some reason and didnt want me to feel like I was being ghosted. Unfortunately I didn't think to ask when he was getting off or when it would be okay to call, so I'm having to wait till tomorrow morning to be polite. Gonna ask him for coffee or breakfast sometime.

I‚Äôm a 23F who recently moved to Bangalore, and honestly, I‚Äôm super excited (and slightly overwhelmed üòÖ) about everything this city has to offer. I‚Äôve heard so much about Bangalore‚Äôs energy ‚Äî the cafes, the music scene, the weather (except when it suddenly decides to pour!), and the blend of people from all over the country.

Right now, I‚Äôm in that phase where every corner feels new ‚Äî from getting used to the traffic and auto guys quoting their own exchange rates üòÑ to discovering how beautiful the city can be when it rains. I don‚Äôt know many people here yet, so I‚Äôm hoping to explore more ‚Äî and maybe even find a few like-minded folks to tag along sometimes.

A bit about me:
üå∏ I love exploring ‚Äî especially offbeat cafes, bookstores, flea markets, parks, and art spaces.
üé∂ I‚Äôm into music gigs, open mics, and chill live performances (if you know good places for that, please share!).
‚òï A big fan of slow mornings with coffee and long conversations.
üåø Also enjoy nature walks, small treks, and discovering quiet corners in the middle of city chaos.
üìö Recently getting back into reading and journaling ‚Äî so I‚Äôd also love to know about any local book clubs or creative communities.

What I‚Äôm hoping for here:

Some local recommendations ‚Äî cafes, events, weekend getaways, or anything ‚Äúonly-in-Bangalore‚Äù that‚Äôs worth checking out.

Maybe finding people who enjoy spontaneous hangouts, trying new food spots, or attending cultural events together.

Or even just some friendly chats and city-life tips from fellow Bangaloreans.


I‚Äôve seen a few community meet-ups posted here and I‚Äôd love to join something like that ‚Äî or even help plan one if others are interested!

So yeah, that‚Äôs me ‚Äî new girl in the city trying to make Bangalore feel like home üå∏

I was happily surprised that I didn‚Äôt want to throat-punch him once during the 4 days and actually had an amazing time. What the hell.

Here are the some of the ways he met  my standards of treatment by a man:

* Organised everything while being open to feedback
* Picked me up (once I‚Äôd decided it was safe enough for him to know where I live), drove us around and took me home
* Listened closely to what I was saying, showed interest in getting to know me as a whole person, mutual conversation
* Made me laugh
* Paid for absolutely everything, wouldn't even accept a token gesture of me paying for coffees
* Also paid close attention to my preferences so he knew them eg how I like my coffee, where I like to sit, my favourite wine/foods, when I like wake up/go to sleep
* His focus was always on me, not other random people including attractive women
* Low-key, appropriate compliments and flirting, nothing sexual, but also specific to me
* Romantic touch/kisses, nothing gropey or full on
* Took me to a classical music concert even though it‚Äôs not his thing, enjoyed it and thanked me for introducing him to do something new
* Noticed if I expressed mild displeasure by withdrawing my attention and adjusted his behaviour
* I did not feel like I had to censor my opinions and he never reacted defensively or angrily to any of them
* Walked my dog with me and was kind to her
* Got up early before he checked out of this accommodation to drive half an hour to the hardware store to buy tools, then came around to my place before to install a dog door for me while I drank coffee on the couch AND cleaned up afterwards. I had to stop him from doing more projects (‚ÄúYou can do that next time‚Äù)
* Arranged the next visit when I said no to an invitation somewhere else (I‚Äôm not ready to go away with him)

I felt calm, safe and happy in his company. Let‚Äôs see if he keeps this up, is it even possible? If he does, this old hag might be at risk of feeling some feelings.",8,1760245211.0,WomenDatingOverForty,12,0.9,False

We all take turns hosting a monthly gathering at our houses (2 of the friends are brother and sister). It was my turn to host, and I was having a week from hell at work, and brother (we'll call him Russ) knew I was having a rough week and asked to meet me for coffee. We met up, and I told him I was probably going to have to cancel for this month. He offered to take over for me this month, and when I offered to help him out a little, he responded with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I got this shit on lock‚Äù, which should have been the first red flag.

I DD‚Äôd for all the other girls, and drove all of us up to Russ and his sister Monique‚Äôs house to find her already tipsy, and him taking a shot of something. I looked around, and all I saw were two half-eaten bags of chips, a medium pizza, and their dining table full of alcohol. I offered to run to the store to grab some more food, but everyone else said this was fine and went to fix themselves drinks. I had a glass of water, and a bowl of chips (I‚Äôm vegetarian, and he got meat lovers pizza).

A couple of hours later, I was holding my friend‚Äôs hair back and telling the girls to grab their coats so we could go. I heard yelling in the living room, and didn‚Äôt think anything of it until I heard a gunshot. I walked out, to see Russ standing on a stool with the gun pointed in the air, and a friend sitting on the floor laughing. Russ saw that I had walked into the room, lowered the gun then said something I didn't understand. I walked over to take the gun from him, and he raised the gun to fire it at our friend, but instead shot me in the thigh. I fell, and everyone else started cackling around me. I tied a scarf around my leg for pressure, limped to my car, and drove to the ER.

Over the next month, I got calls and text from a few friends checking up on me, and offering to come stay with me if I needed any help. Monique asked if Russ had texted me yet, and said ‚ÄúI think he feels really bad, so when he does, don‚Äôt be to hard on him‚Äù. I chose not to respond to that text.¬†

After two months, Russ texted me asking to meet up for coffee. I agreed, expecting him to apologize. Instead, he sat sipping on a hot chocolate that I had to pay for because he ‚Äúforgot his wallet‚Äù, and telling me that his feelings were really hurt that I left early and didn‚Äôt like his ‚Äúprank‚Äù. When I asked what prank, he said the plan was to prank me into thinking he shot our friend, but he would load the gun with blanks, and when I saw she wasn‚Äôt dead, I would be relieved. I pointed out that he could have killed our friend, and he responded with ""but that didn't happen, so I don't know why you're bringing that up"". I stood up, threw my (iced) coffee on him, said ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and walked away.

Basic hygiene, eating, even breathing took effort. 

Every thought was poisonous. 

Every movement was agony. 

The real world expects grief to be temporary. 

They expect it to fucking expire like coffee. 

‚ÄúBeatrice, I know you lost your mother, and I'm sorry for your loss. But you can't kill Kaian.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

My agent sighed. ‚ÄúYou know he's a fan favorite.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, *Bee*.‚Äù

He had been there a while, perched on my desk, dark singed wings fluttering and knocking books to the floor. 

Prince Kaian, the disgraced royal of the Evermore court and brother and rival to my main love interest. 

No matter how hard I tried to focus on Prince Ciaran, the lost and noble hero, it was the brooding bad-boy Kaian who captured the fans. He sat, arms folded, glaring. The dagger from his sacrifice scene was lodged in his skull, beads of red seeping down his face and soaking his crown of thorns. ‚Äú*I‚Äôm* supposed to be the fan favorite,‚Äù he mocked. 

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù I motioned for him to shoo. 

‚ÄúBeatrice, who are you talking to?‚Äù my agent asked.

‚ÄúUh, nobody!‚Äù I ended the call.

‚ÄúBee.‚Äù Kaian said. ‚ÄúYou'll lose your readers if you kill me.‚Äù

I ignored him, focusing on the document. ‚ÄúI don't care.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

Something cold slithered down my spine. 

‚ÄúRewrite it,‚Äù he said, nose to nose with me. ‚ÄúOr I'll tell everyone why I exist.‚Äù 

His lips twitched. ‚ÄúWhy you can't look me in the fucking eye.‚Äù

My hands froze on my keyboard. 

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù Kaian grinned. ‚ÄúWhere did you get the inspiration for me, Beatrice?‚Äù he cocked his head. ‚Äú*Well*?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's‚Ä¶‚Äù 

*‚ÄúThat's?‚Äù* He mocked my voice. ‚ÄúCome on, spit it out!‚Äù

I took a handful of meds, swallowing them with lukewarm coke. 

Kaian faded, but his voice remained. Screaming. 

My phone vibrated, and I grabbed it. 

‚ÄúSorry, Bee, we were cut off,‚Äù my agent said. ‚ÄúWhat were you saying?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe second book,‚Äù I said, pushing through the door to my bedroom. Cold. 

Quiet. 

The stink of disinfectant and blood hung in the air. I let out a breath of relief. 

They were still there. 

Three bodies retrained, tubes stuck down their throat. 

Characters were always hard. 

Especially after Mom died. 

Grief took away my thoughts, swamping me in mind fog. I  couldn't think straight. Everyone expected me to make amazing characters, and I couldn't. 

Throughout my writing career, I was always asked the exact same question: What gave you the inspiration for these beloved fairies? 

The human, Frieren, and the fae brothers fighting for her. 

My answers were my muses. 

Nameless. 

Hollow, like empty shells.

The man with Kaian‚Äôs face twitched, eyes flickering, straining against the restraints. 

Out of the corner of my eye, Kaian stood in the window, head tilted back, an icy breeze brushing the nape of my neck. 

His lips twisted into a scowl.

‚ÄúPsycho bitch,‚Äù he muttered.

As if in agreement, my muse convulsed.

I ignored them.

I'm 18 and he's 22 now.

It started when I was a little girl in elementary school, he would tell me to go into my closet, close us inside, and he'd show me p**n videos even though I told him I didn't want to.

Things got even more sinister when he would go into my room and talk about s*x and asked if he wanted me to... Have it with him. His voice and face were so eager about it.

And the worst part that mortified me the most is that whenever he borrowed the bathroom that was in my room he would straight up... FLASH ME. I was terrified of him using my bathroom because I know he would try that over and over again whenever the door opens back up. I was a little girl I didn't want to see any of that stuff.

He'd also come into my room and beat me sometimes if I annoyed him. He'd mostly just kick the back of my legs. Sometimes he would literally just come into my room and kick the hell out of me for no reason. What did I do??? He's a lot bigger than me so that hurt like hell. I could forgive him for this though because fights are normal for siblings and I of course got revenge.

There's a 4 year difference between us so I think he was in either 5th or 6th grade and I was in 1st or 2nd grade. I'm not entirely sure though.

We used to share a room growing up but once he was at the age of puberty I guess Mom decided to give me my own room. That sexual abuse took place in my OWN room.

I haven't told ANYONE about this because I feel so incredibly ashamed even now I still do. I don't even think my parents would believe me now if I did tell them. My brother would deny it. He's a quiet and antisocial guy so nobody would think he was being incestuous towards his own sister.

Me and my brothers relationship has gotten a lot more chill now over the years though. He let's me use all his game consoles and buys me coffee. Maybe he remembers it and feels bad so that's why he's so chill to me now to try and make up for it. Like I said I forgot about this for a few years so I guess that's how our relationship improved.

I should absolutely hate his guts for perving on me like that but for some reason I still find myself wanting to hang out with him and bug him all the time. Definitely using him for the free Dunkin though.

I‚Äôve always been a coffee lover. That rich aroma in the morning, the first sip that wakes you up, and the calm focus that follows ‚Äî it‚Äôs something I look forward to every day.

But what I didn‚Äôt realize at first was that coffee could do more than just keep me awake. Over time, I started noticing small but positive changes in my body. I felt more active, less bloated, and even managed to control my cravings. That‚Äôs when I began to explore **how coffee supports weight loss** ‚Äî and what I found amazed me.

When I started researching (and later sharing it on **gomehedi.com**), I discovered that coffee isn‚Äôt just an energy booster ‚Äî it‚Äôs also a **natural metabolism supporter**. Coffee contains **caffeine**, **antioxidants**, and other natural compounds that help the body burn fat more effectively.

Let‚Äôs break it down simply. When you drink coffee, caffeine sends a signal to your brain to stay alert. At the same time, it tells your body to **release fat from fat tissues** and use it as energy. This means your body starts burning stored fat faster ‚Äî which helps in weight control.

For me, coffee became a small daily habit that made a big difference. I didn‚Äôt make major changes to my diet at first, but I noticed that I felt lighter, more focused, and less hungry during the day. That‚Äôs when I realized ‚Äî coffee isn‚Äôt a magic drink, but it‚Äôs definitely a powerful **natural helper** in any weight loss journey.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered, ‚ÄúCan coffee really help me lose weight?‚Äù ‚Äî the answer is yes, when you drink it smartly. Let‚Äôs look at how this simple drink actually works inside your body.

¬†

# How Coffee Actually Supports Weight Loss (Explained in Simple Words)

I believe that understanding how something works helps you use it better. So, let‚Äôs talk about how coffee helps the body **burn fat, boost metabolism, and control hunger** ‚Äî all in simple, easy-to-grasp ways.

# 1. Coffee Boosts Metabolism Naturally

Your **metabolism** is like your body‚Äôs engine. It decides how fast you burn calories. The faster it runs, the more calories you burn ‚Äî even when you‚Äôre sitting.

Caffeine, which is found in coffee, naturally speeds up metabolism. Studies from health institutions (like Harvard Health and Mayo Clinic) show that caffeine can **increase your metabolic rate by 3% to 11%** depending on your body type and intake.

When I drink a cup of black coffee in the morning, I feel more awake and active. But inside my body, my metabolism is also running faster ‚Äî which means I‚Äôm burning calories even while working at my desk.

That‚Äôs one of the reasons why **black coffee** is often recommended in many weight management programs. It helps your body use energy more efficiently without adding calories.

¬†

# 2. Coffee Encourages Fat Burning (Fat Oxidation)

Here‚Äôs something most people don‚Äôt know: coffee actually **helps the body burn stored fat**.

Caffeine triggers the release of **adrenaline**, a hormone that tells your body to break down fat cells. Once those fats are released into the bloodstream, your body starts using them as energy.

This process is known as **fat oxidation** ‚Äî a natural way your body turns fat into fuel.

When I first learned this, I started drinking my coffee 30 minutes before exercise. It gave me a noticeable energy boost, and I could see better results over time.

That‚Äôs why many fitness experts and nutritionists recommend having coffee before workouts ‚Äî it increases endurance and helps you burn more fat.

¬†

# 3. Coffee Reduces Appetite Naturally

Another reason I love coffee is that it helps control my hunger. When I drink a cup of coffee between meals, I don‚Äôt feel the urge to snack unnecessarily.

Caffeine slightly **lowers appetite hormones**, like **ghrelin**, which means you feel full for a longer period.

This is especially useful when you‚Äôre cutting calories or following intermittent fasting. A simple cup of black coffee can help you manage cravings without adding extra calories.

¬†

# 4. Coffee Improves Workout Performance

I noticed that I perform better during walks, workouts, or any physical activity when I drink coffee beforehand.

Caffeine increases **adrenaline** and **focus**, giving you more energy and mental alertness. As a result, you can move more, lift more, and stay active for longer ‚Äî which means more calories burned.

For example, I often drink a cup of black coffee 30‚Äì40 minutes before my morning walk or light exercise. It‚Äôs like a natural pre-workout drink that boosts both body and mind.

¬†

# 5. Coffee Supports Intermittent Fasting

If you practice intermittent fasting, coffee can be your best friend. Black coffee has almost **zero calories** and **doesn‚Äôt break your fast**.

When I skip breakfast, I often drink coffee during fasting hours. It helps me stay full, alert, and energetic while my body continues to burn fat.

This combination ‚Äî fasting plus black coffee ‚Äî has been one of the easiest and most effective ways I‚Äôve managed my weight.

# The Right Way to Drink Coffee for Weight Loss (What I Learned Through Experience)

Drinking coffee the right way makes all the difference. When I first started, I made common mistakes ‚Äî too much sugar, too many lattes, and drinking too late at night. But once I learned how to drink it properly, I saw real results.

Here are the lessons I‚Äôve learned from my own journey and from research I‚Äôve shared on **gomehedi.com**.

¬†

# 1. Drink It Black (Or Almost Black)

The best coffee for weight loss is **black coffee** ‚Äî plain, pure, and calorie-free.

Every spoon of sugar or cream adds calories that cancel out the benefits. For example, one spoon of sugar adds about **16 calories**, and a few spoons daily can lead to weight gain over time.

If you prefer a milder taste, try:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Adding a few drops of **stevia** (a natural zero-calorie sweetener)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mixing with **unsweetened almond milk** or **oat milk**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Using **cinnamon** powder for flavor and extra fat-burning benefits

¬†

# 2. Best Time to Drink Coffee for Fat-Burning

Timing matters! Here‚Äôs what works best for me:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Morning coffee**: jump-starts metabolism and energy

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Pre-workout coffee (30 minutes before)**: boosts performance and calorie burn

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Avoid late-night coffee**: caffeine can disturb sleep, and poor sleep affects weight control

When I followed this timing pattern, I noticed I was more active during the day and slept better at night ‚Äî both important for healthy weight management.

¬†

# 3. Explore Healthier Coffee Types

Not everyone enjoys plain black coffee, and that‚Äôs okay. There are other healthy coffee options that support metabolism:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Green Coffee:** made from unroasted beans, contains chlorogenic acid that may reduce fat absorption.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Keto Coffee:** blended with butter or MCT oil; keeps you full and energized for hours.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Mushroom Coffee:** infused with adaptogenic mushrooms like Lion‚Äôs Mane and Reishi; supports focus and natural fat-burning.

I personally switch between black and mushroom coffee depending on my mood. It keeps things interesting and healthy.

You can read detailed comparisons of these types at [**gomehedi.com**](http://gomehedi.com), where I share reviews, recipes, and brewing tips for weight-friendly coffee options.

¬†

# 4. Watch Your Quantity

Too much caffeine can cause restlessness, anxiety, or stomach irritation. The safe amount is about **3‚Äì4 cups per day** (or roughly 400 mg of caffeine).

I keep it simple ‚Äî one cup in the morning, one before my workout. That‚Äôs enough to stay active without overdoing it.

¬†

# 5. Pair Coffee With Healthy Habits

Coffee alone won‚Äôt magically melt fat. But when combined with good habits, it becomes a powerful ally.  
Here‚Äôs what I follow daily:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Drink enough water to stay hydrated

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Eat whole, balanced meals

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sleep at least 7 hours

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Move daily ‚Äî even simple walking counts

Once I started combining these habits with coffee, I saw slow but steady progress. My weight dropped, my energy stayed high, and I felt more confident every day.

For anyone starting their journey, my best advice is: **don‚Äôt overthink it. Keep it simple, consistent, and enjoyable.**

¬†

# Beyond Weight Loss ‚Äî Other Amazing Health Benefits of Coffee

After making coffee a part of my healthy lifestyle, I realized it does much more than just support fat loss. Here are some of the other benefits I‚Äôve personally felt ‚Äî and science agrees with them.

¬†

# 1. Coffee Lifts Mood and Reduces Stress

Coffee doesn‚Äôt just wake me up ‚Äî it lifts my mood. Caffeine increases dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, which are the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù chemicals.

Whenever I feel tired or low, a warm cup of coffee helps me reset my focus and energy. Studies also show that regular coffee drinkers have a **lower risk of depression**.

¬†

# 2. Coffee Improves Focus and Memory

I find it easier to think clearly after drinking coffee. It helps me stay focused, especially when I‚Äôm working on creative or detailed tasks.

Caffeine increases brain activity and helps improve short-term memory. That‚Äôs why many people rely on coffee during work or study hours.

¬†

# 3. Coffee Supports Heart and Liver Health

Many people think coffee is bad for the heart, but research proves otherwise. Moderate coffee drinking (2‚Äì4 cups daily) can actually **reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes**.

It also protects the **liver** by reducing fat buildup and lowering the risk of liver disease.

This shows that coffee, when taken in moderation, supports both **weight and overall health.**

¬†

# 4. Coffee Is Rich in Antioxidants

Coffee is one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in most people‚Äôs diets. Antioxidants protect the body from free radicals ‚Äî harmful molecules that speed up aging and cause inflammation.

That means every cup of coffee helps your body stay healthier and younger from the inside out.

¬†

# 5. Coffee Gives Sustainable Energy (Without Sugar Crashes)

Unlike sugary energy drinks that give a quick rush and sudden drop, coffee provides steady, natural energy. It helps you stay active and focused throughout the day.

That‚Äôs one reason it‚Äôs perfect for weight management ‚Äî you stay alert, productive, and less likely to crave junk food.

# Final Thoughts: Coffee Can Be Your Simple Weight Loss Partner

Coffee changed how I see health. It‚Äôs not a magic drink, but it‚Äôs a natural and effective tool that supports weight management when used wisely.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Drink coffee **without sugar** or cream.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Have **1‚Äì2 cups a day** for steady fat-burning benefits.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pair it with **good food, movement, and enough sleep**.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Avoid late-night cups to protect your rest.

When I made these small adjustments, I didn‚Äôt just lose weight ‚Äî I gained energy, focus, and motivation.

If you‚Äôre starting your journey, take it one cup at a time. Your daily coffee can become your healthiest habit.

My ex-girlfriend and I broke up around 7 months ago. She told me when we broke up she would move on by seeing other people to distract herself. 

After we split I felt fairly green-lighted to go out and meet people immediately given what she told me. I met a girl about a month after we split up and we began hanging out nearly every day. 

Out of pure chance, about 1.5-2 months after my ex and I broke up, I stopped at a crosswalk while driving this new girl home from a coffee date. My ex happened to be the one crossing the street, and she saw the girl and I in the car. 

My ex is now going around telling many people that I cheated on her with this girl, and only broke up with her to pursue the new girl. 

She‚Äôs telling people I met this girl while I studied abroad last year, cheated on her while I studied abroad, and that‚Äôs why I broke up with her when I came back. 

This is literally just a blatant lie. Didn‚Äôt even know this new girl existed until a month after we split up. 

My ex has taken this rhetoric to social media and is posting about how I cheated. I never did? I don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation. 

Do I ask her to stop? Do I just let her cope? I‚Äôm not sure what to do. The new girl and I have been official for a couple of months now and I‚Äôve told her the situation.

He always been quiet and introverted. He just works, comes home, goes to gym, and plays one or two games if he isnt too tired. Most of his early 20s were spent helping out our family and working long hours. He didn‚Äôt go out, didn‚Äôt date, didn‚Äôt have much of a social life as far as i know.

He also never did much around the house, but not because he was lazy. He was always exhausted. My mom and I handled his laundry and meals because we knew how much he was doing for everyone else. It just became routine.

Last September, he finally moved out. Because our sister was able to get scholarship, he can now afford to get his place. He found a small apartment closer to his job because he hates driving and traffic.

Then he met her. She‚Äôs 38.
At first, she seemed good for him. She‚Äôs got a stable job, she‚Äôs responsible, and she really takes care of him. She cooks, makes sure he eats healthy, keeps his place tidy when she comes over and she‚Äôs affectionate. Honestly, he looks healthier since they got together.

What ""feels"" wrong is he moved in with him after just six months of dating. No big talk, no planning  she just started spending the night more and more until she never left. Now they live together full-time.

My mom‚Äôs clearly uncomfortable. She‚Äôs polite when the woman‚Äôs around, but I can tell it bothers her especially since the woman is only six years younger than her. Mom said she‚Äôs not going to intervene, though. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his first girlfriend,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an adult. Let him figure it out.‚Äù

She goes through his phone all the time not secretly, just openly. She even knows his password of EVERYTHING. The first time I saw it while i was staying over at his place, she said, ‚ÄúCan I check your calls and texts real quick?‚Äù

He just let her. Didn't ask why. Didn't even care. Just ""Sure"".

Things i thought was weird :

She shows up in his office randomly ""Just to see him""
Always goes to gym with him eventho she doesnt exercise herself.
Has access to all of his social media and blocks and unfollows people without asking.
Always location sharing.
Even checks his steam account for some reason.
Completely manages his wardrobe and finance.
Asks about every single woman in his office from his pictures
Once went looking for us while we were having coffee. Said ""Just wanted to make sure""


My brother doesn‚Äôt see any of this as a problem. He laughs about it. Says things like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how she is"". He told me once, ""Its's actually nice for him to not worry about anything‚Äù

My sister, though, is worried. She thinks the woman is too controlling and that my brother doesn‚Äôt realize how fast everything‚Äôs moving. She said it feels like he‚Äôs being swallowed by this relationship without even noticing.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think. He seems happy and maybe that‚Äôs all that matters. But recently he said she has been talking about marriage. It has barely been year since they met.

I just don't know if i should say something.

We called it Swemromas. I graduated, moved to the other side of the country, and haven't been back since. But I still follow W&M on instagram and I saw that now that coffee shop is something called Column? When did that happen? Why did that happen?

1o4fqgt,https://v.redd.it/v6i2lhzqxluf1,Junior developer jobs and internships; AI and eSafety,"TLDR: hosting an event where we‚Äôre working with Aus Gov eSafety Commissioner and creating a fake online social media platform seeded with spicy personas like manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, body dysmorphia groups, some LinkedIn Lunatics and others. Fun event where you‚Äôll build something that can identify these personas and make the internet a bit safer and less toxic for everyone. 2 of the main sponsors are offering internships early 2026 and are hiring for 18 junior dev roles.

Hey RMIT peeps. I‚Äôm putting on a hackathon with Aus Gov eSafety commissioner around cleaning up the internet. I‚Äôm posting because I know how INSANELY hard it‚Äôs becoming to find junior roles and internships these days. The hack will be fun plus there are 2 sponsors offering internships early next year and have 18 roles open for juniors in EdTech, AI and eSafety.

Here‚Äôs the full spiel for the event: Not sure if you‚Äôve noticed but the internet is becoming a crazy place. We‚Äôve got manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, misinfo and disinfo, social media bans for children and teens, that Netflix show ‚ÄòAdolescence‚Äô, and it‚Äôs getting harder to tell what‚Äôs AI slop. So I‚Äôm putting on an event with the Australian Governments eSafety Commissioner as part of the ‚Äú16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence‚Äù campaign in November.

It‚Äôs a fun event where we‚Äôll come together and we‚Äôll learn about these groups and build something that can help us identify these personas and hopefully work towards making the internet safer/better.

There‚Äôll be big prizes, catering, free coffee and it‚Äôs hosted in Melbourne CBD Nov 29-30.

I‚Äôve put a lot of work into making it fun, survivor friendly and enlightening so please give it a look! Even if you don‚Äôt end up coming please just give it a look :)

It‚Äôs called Needle In The Hashtag eSafety Hackathon and I‚Äôll post a link in comments",1,1760242863.0,rmit,1,1.0,False

And the flow was realllly good cause before it used to just flow as water. And it did not tasted bitter as usual ü§£

Just want to share that who ever is new to this hobby, it has a learning curve in its own, so instead of rushing and thinking its way too hard, keep learning and experimenting and you‚Äôll get better at it. 
The grinder I used was this basic aashinoe grinder from amazon. Cause dam it‚Äôs expensive to do this coffee thing. 
Will upgrade to that mhw grinder in future when I have extra money to spend on coffeeüòÖ",1,1760242739.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False
