ok..

S bug vgjrsjeveo myyexhamgbrush

Aannnnyway.

So ive been trying to get my machine dialled in for literally 3 days now. I’ve watched countless videos, gone through 2 whole bags of coffee beans, tried different techniques, adjusted here there and everywhere. My shots are GROSS! Although the pucks come out looking good every time, nice and evenly compact, the shots are just abysmal. Today i literally spent 4 hours, 4 HOURS! Heres what i did. 

I have a 51mm bottomless portafilter stating size capacity is 16-18 grams however any less than 17grams and after the tamp the basket isnt full enough to create a puck. So i started off with 18 grams even (scaled out) and went through different coarseness. When i reached a “dialed in” ratio, of 18g in, 34 out in 27 seconds, it tasted awful. i went ahead and pulled the same shot again but this time with the good ol salami shot, thinking it might be that the first 5 seconds of the extraction are whats throwing off the flavour. (Side note i pre heated my machine and checked temp) i pulled a salami of 8 cups 5 seconds each for a total of 40 seconds and the first 3 tasted like literal soy sauce and then the last 5 tasted over extracted bitter yuck. So i thought ok i either have too big of a basket or my grind is too fine so i went up one tick coarseness from 4-5 to find out that it changed basically nothing. The 3 cups (especially the 1st one) were pouring way too slow and tasted extremely sour, salty and acidic, and immediately after just bitter and dry. There was no sweet spot between. So again i decided to go up one coarseness from 5-6 keeping it at 18grams and again this time the shot ran nasty the first couple cups, very slow & under extracted. (I made sure not to tamp too hard, applying even pressure without straining the wrist)  this time what would happen is that out of the 8 salami samples, 1 was extremely thick, like syrup, 2 & 3 looked like normal espresso but tasted nasty & then 4-8 jumped to very watery and with barely any difference between them in texture & flavour. So just to make sure i went to 18g at 7 coarseness and low and behold the same thing. So i went back down gradually but this time with a basket size of 17.5g and back at around 4 on the fineness i thought i might be getting close but then i ended up seeing the opposite where the first 5 shots were very thick and under extracted from extremely slow extraction and the last 3 were again very watered down as the extraction would somehow greatly pick up speed and become very watered down. I ended up, 4 hours later, literally a whole bag of coffee wasted, feeling like a fully charged lithium ion battery (even though i spit out all the shots cuz ik i would die if i drank that much coffee) and the closest i got was at 7 coarsness @ 17.75 grams for a visually gradual decrease in thickness and colour of the salami shots but still, the first 3 tasted nasty and were way too thick & the next 5 were watered down. The 5 didnt taste all that bad actually, not so bitter just kinda like a drip coffee almost, so i know i could hypothetically skip the first 10 seconds of the extraction but then id have a pretty watery, over extracted espresso shot so whats the point. 

Idk what to do as it seems if i go lower in dose it doesnt work because of basket size & if i go coarser the 2nd half of the pull is over extracted. The only thing i can think of left to do is drastically increase the dose with a far coarser grind or drastically decrease the dose with a finer grind because it looks like the current dose - grind range im in rn is doing me no good & i honestly dont know where to begin. 

Help or i will give up & buy a drip coffee machine ☕️",0,1732082923.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

1gvizof,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorEncounters28/comments/1gvizof/is_your_name_on_this_chilling_list_the_radio/,"""Is Your Name on This Chilling List?""| ""The Radio Broadcast That Predicts Disappearances!"" | Cache Light Tales","In a small town, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, WLNK 97.3—The Link—served as the heartbeat of the community. This local radio station played a little bit of everything: classic rock, pop hits, and even talk shows that filled the gaps when advertising money ran dry. It was the kind of station that lingered in the background of diners, garages, and grocery stores. For Ethan Grant, it had always been a familiar presence—a comforting hum that accompanied his daily life.But everything changed three months ago. It was a night that would haunt him forever.

On a chilly Monday evening, Ethan was driving home from work, the scent of rain-soaked asphalt filling his car as he flipped through radio stations. He landed on WLNK, not really paying attention to what was playing. The DJ’s voice came through the speakers, warm and inviting, wrapping around him like a favorite blanket. “And now… the name of the night,” the DJ announced, his tone shifting into something playful yet unsettling. Ethan leaned closer to the radio, curious. There was a pause, a crackle of static that sent shivers down his spine. Then came the name: “Jessica Browning.” Ethan frowned. It felt strange—just a name dropped into the air with no context or explanation. He shrugged it off and continued driving, but something nagged at him.  The following week, he found himself tuning in again at the same time. The DJ repeated his ritual: “And now… the name of the night.” This time it was “Robert Sanchez.”  Ethan’s brow furrowed as he listened. What was this segment? Was it part of some contest? He couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more to it. As weeks passed, Ethan became more intrigued by this peculiar broadcast. Each Monday night at exactly 11:05 PM, one name would be announced—no explanation given. By the fifth week, curiosity had morphed into obsession. He started taking notes in a small notebook he kept in his car. The names piled up: Jessica Browning, Robert Sanchez, Caleb Howard. Each week he would search local news sites and social media for any mention of these names but found nothing—until Caleb’s name caught his eye. Caleb worked at the gas station near Ethan’s apartment. They weren’t friends, but they exchanged pleasantries whenever Ethan stopped for coffee or snacks. Caleb always wore a friendly smile that made Ethan feel at ease. Then one day, as Ethan pulled into the gas station parking lot, he noticed something unsettling—a “Help Find Caleb” poster taped to the door. His heart sank as he read about Caleb’s disappearance after his last shift.



“His car is still here,” said the nervous clerk behind the counter, glancing around as if afraid someone might overhear. “No one knows where he went.” Ethan’s mind raced back to WLNK and that name announced just a week prior. It couldn’t be just coincidence; something sinister was at play. Determined to uncover the truth behind these names, Ethan began digging deeper into each case he had noted down in his notebook. By now, three names—Jessica Browning, Robert Sanchez, and Caleb Howard—were confirmed missing persons in their town. He felt an icy grip of fear wrap around him as he stared at their photos online—each face filled with hope and promise now reduced to desperate pleas from friends and family searching for answers. Ethan tried to talk to people about what he had discovered, but they looked at him like he was crazy. “WLNK? I listen to it all the time,” they would say dismissively. “I’ve never heard anything unusual.” Frustration bubbled inside him; how could no one else see what he had discovered? The eighth week rolled around, and Ethan braced himself for another name announcement on WLNK. This time it was “Emily Carter.” He didn’t know her personally but quickly found her social media profile filled with pictures of smiling pets and cheerful updates about her job as a veterinary assistant. An uneasy feeling settled in his stomach as he sent her an awkward message: “Hi! You don’t know me, but I heard your name on WLNK tonight. Please be careful.”Days passed without a response from Emily; her posts continued normally until exactly one week later when they abruptly stopped.



Ethan’s heart raced when he saw a news article titled: “Local Veterinary Assistant Reported Missing.”  Unable to shake off his growing anxiety, Ethan decided to confront this mystery head-on. He began visiting WLNK’s building after hours, lurking outside like a detective in an old noir film. The station was housed in an old brick building downtown that seemed to sag under its own weight. Each night he waited patiently for signs of life inside—the flicker of lights or shadows moving across windows—but nothing happened until one fateful Monday night. At 10:30 PM on another dreary evening filled with thick clouds and looming rain, Ethan parked outside WLNK once more. The building was dark except for one light glowing faintly on the second floor. His heart pounded like a drum in his chest as he waited for 11:05 PM. When it finally arrived, he heard it—the muffled sound of the DJ’s voice drifting through the walls: “And now… the name of the night.” With adrenaline surging through him like electricity, Ethan burst through the door. Inside was eerily silent; an unsettling chill swept through him as he stepped into the reception area where dust motes danced lazily in beams of moonlight filtering through grimy windows. The reception desk sat empty; dark hallways stretched out before him like gaping maws waiting to swallow him whole. He followed the sound of static-filled broadcasting up creaky stairs until he reached a door slightly ajar at the end of a dimly lit hallway. Warm light spilled out into the corridor like honey dripping from a jar.Pushing open the door revealed an old studio—an outdated desk cluttered with papers and tangled wires from ancient broadcasting equipment lay before him. The ON AIR sign flickered weakly above him while static crackled ominously through speakers.“Brandon Lewis,” came the voice again—the DJ announcing yet another name without context or explanation.



Ethan stepped closer to investigate when suddenly everything went silent—the equipment powered down abruptly leaving only heavy silence hanging in the air like fog after rain. As Ethan scanned the room in confusion, something caught his eye—a list taped to the wall behind where the DJ would sit. His breath caught in his throat as he approached it cautiously; each name written in neat looping handwriting sent chills racing down his spine. He recognized several names immediately—Jessica Browning… Robert Sanchez… Caleb Howard… Emily Carter… And then there it was—the last entry scrawled across yellowing paper: Panic surged through him like wildfire; sweat beaded on his forehead as reality crashed down around him like waves against rocky cliffs. It had been six days since that broadcast—and now here he stood staring at evidence that suggested he might be next.Ethan fled from WLNK’s building faster than he ever thought possible; adrenaline propelled him down dark streets until he reached his apartment complex—a sanctuary turned prison in his mind.Once inside, every door and window were locked tight; curtains drawn against prying eyes outside while shadows danced menacingly along walls illuminated only by flickering lights overhead.He sat on his bed trembling with fear; every noise outside felt amplified—a siren wailing somewhere far off echoed against silence like an omen warning him of impending doom.His phone rang occasionally but remained unanswered; each call felt like an invitation into darkness—a reminder that something terrible loomed just beyond reach waiting patiently for its chance to strike again…Tomorrow would mark day seven since Brandon Lewis’ name had been announced—a countdown echoing ominously within him like church bells tolling for lost souls trapped between worlds unknown…

1gvizis,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureCertification/comments/1gvizis/questions_about_some_rules/,Questions about some rules...,"I have an exam this morning, and I have some last-minute questions...

I have 6 monitors, standing desk and a television behind me. A macbook which is a laptop provided by the company I work, and a desktop computer... I plan to remove laptop but monitors are too complicated to remove... I also plan to take the exam on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra becuse I don't have a webcam on my desktop computer, and I can't use the macbook the company provided due to it's strickt security measures and vpn setup..  My tablet has a keyboard and a touchpad.  
My girlfriend has a low powered HP laptop this is another option...

I will keep my standing desk lowered because I don't think I can change my position once I start...  so I will be taking the exam while sitting on my chair.

\- Did anyone take the exam on a tablet?  
\- It's my first Microsoft Exam (AZ-900), do you think my monitors would be a problem even though I keep them turned off?  
\- Would I need to use my gf's laptop or is tablet okay for the exam?  
\-  Is it better to do it in a coffee shop like Starbucks or somewhere else?  
\- Do I need to show my desk before the exam? Maybe they wouldn't realize that I have too many monitors.  
\- Is it okay to use optical glasses? I don't see anything without glasses... And I didn't choose the option for special requirement...  
\- I have a big mouse pad that covers the whole desk, and it has a black world map on it, would this kind of things invalidate my exam?",1,1732082723.0,AzureCertification,0,1.0,False
1gviyyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1gviyyw/should_i_be_worried_about_my_marriage/,Should I be worried about my marriage? ,"My (37f) husband (39m) just quit talking to me. It hasnt been long, only 3 days, but he has totally shut me out. We have been together for 21 years, married for 8. We didn't get into an argument. In fact, we rarely do. A few days ago, we went to visit our new niece who was born very early and is in the Natal Intensive Care Unit in a nearby city. We went and met up with the baby's parents, his sister and husband. The visit went great, it was so nice to finally meet the baby and to see his sister and her husband. She and I are very close. Have been for years. We even went out to dinner with them afterwards, got to catch up with them. I thought we all had a nice time. We went home, hung out with the kids, all seemed good. The next morning, he woke me up with a cup of coffee, as he often does on the weekends. I love it, said thanks you, got a kiss, and fell back asleep. I stay up late and tend to sleep in on mornings when no alarm wakes me up. When I woke back up and hour or so later, it all seems to have went wrong. He barely acknowledged my presence in the room. I got bundled up and took the dog out. Husband has already been in and out ofnthe house tinkering in his shop. He mentions almost tipping a toolbox full of tools, and I make a joke about how ""that's what you get for doing things all by yourself, haha"".. apparently that was the wrong thing to say. He got irritated and I tried to explain I was joking, but he just went quiet. It's been 3 days and he's barely said a word to me or even looked at me. The most I've gotten from him is 'it's fine' 'nothings wrong' and finally 'it's petty'.. this is not exactly abnormal for him, to go quiet and stew on whatever is bothering him, but this feels different. He won't look me in the eye. He hasn't kissed me more than the obligatory feeling peck at bed time and when he leaves for work. I know he's not guilty of anything, nor am I. I believe 100% that we are both 100% faithful. I fear I somehow gave him the ick and now he wants nothing to do with me. At first I thought he was feeling upset and helpless about his sisters situation and everything they have to deal with. He is the oldest brother, but now it feels more personal to me. Am I overthinking this or is he sick of me? I can't tell and its driving me crazy.

I remember this game being on a disk with a bunch of other games from the same publisher I think, but I haven't played it since I was a child (sorry for the bad details ahead). When I think of it, it also reminds me of the Farm Frenzy Games, so maybe that can help narrow it down. 

  
Also, I'm not sure if it was just one game, or several in a series. I do remember that there were different stories where you manage a different restaurant. In one, you turn a castle into a restaurant, and in another you were in a space station that eventually had the crew replaced by aliens and you start serving them midway through the game. I can't remember any other restaurants

Platform: PC (Windows)

Genre: Management (time?), Casual

Year of Release: Pre-2010

Art Style: Cartoony, with a stationary camera overlooking the kitchen/customer counter at a not-quite isometric view

Notable Characters: I know the MC is some sort of girl and she has a guy sidekick. I want to say that they only show up in cutscenes and not in the actual play of the game, but idk.

Notable Gameplay: The Game has missions where your objectives are to serve a number of customers or a number of certain dishes. Early on, you start out with coffee or soda, but as missions go on, you can unlock/buy other equipmeant and decorations.

Other Details: In case you skipped the blurb at the top;  
1) At some point it was published on one of those variety game disks *IIRC*.

2) It *MAY* have a connection to Farm Frenzy via publisher or something, but idk.

3) Below is a very rough image of what the game screen vaguely looked like.

1gviu0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1gviu0x/how_did_you_confess_to_your_straight_crush/,"How did you confess to your ""straight"" crush?","There’s this guy in med school—he’s not physically my type, but there’s just something about him that draws me in. He’s smart, responsible, and honestly, one of the most God-fearing people I’ve ever met. He’s the one who always reminds our batch about deadlines, volunteers to do recordings for online classes, and isn’t afraid to show his emotions when things get tough. That kind of openness—it’s rare, and I find it fascinating.

He comes from a wealthy family—his sister’s a physician, they own a medical laboratory, and his premed was med tech. Meanwhile, I'm M 24, a first-year med student, and people say I come off as intimidating. Maybe it’s the way I’ve carried myself in the past, though I’ve been working on softening that. Deep down, I’m just this odd mix of quirks and randomness. Like yesterday, I made a joke about flying fish mongers, and he didn’t get it. I guess my weirdness doesn’t always land, but that’s okay.

Our first proper interaction was kind of funny. He lied about his name as a joke, and I used my usual go-to Nordic name I give at coffee shops. It turns out both our made-up names are biblical, which is an odd coincidence. Now, we mostly bump into each other during breaks in the bathroom. Small talk. Nothing big or profound, but I like it. Those little exchanges remind me na we’re both here, navigating the same chaos.

A while back, he was absent for days, and I couldn’t help but worry. Med school’s brutal, and I knew something had to be up. Turns out he wasn’t doing okay mentally. When we talked about it later—not in the bathroom this time—I tried to help, just listening the way I learned back in my nursing premed.

Last Sunday, he asked me to keep an eye on the props team for our performance and offered to drive me over. We talked on the way, nothing heavy, just enough to make me feel a little closer to him. And then yesterday, we were watching a dance practice, and he was soaked from the rain. I told myself not to care too much, but when he sat beside me, I handed him my clipboard to fan himself. It felt like such a small thing, but for some reason, it mattered to me.

I’m not expecting anything to come out of this. He’s probably straight, and that’s fine. But if I’m honest, I just want to be part of his life in some way—not just some passing memory of a guy he knew in med school. Something more, even if it’s just real, close friendship. That’s enough for me.

But sometimes, I catch myself wondering—how do I even confess something like this without it feeling awkward or making things more weird?

Thank you.",3,1732082176.0,phlgbt,0,1.0,False
1gvitej,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorEncounters28/comments/1gvitej/overcoming_barriers_for_women/,Overcoming Barriers for Women,"For decades, women have fought tirelessly to carve out their spaces in institutions long dominated by men. Despite significant progress, biases against female students persist, perpetuated by outdated beliefs held by male authorities and a culture that often trivializes their struggles. Fraternities and their tacit endorsement of a toxic culture create barriers that many women must navigate daily. Among those who recognize the necessity for change is Professor John Hargrove. At 48 years old, he has seen the world shift but feels weary and disillusioned by its slow pace. He reflects on his role in this flawed system, contemplating his own mortality as he sits in his dimly lit office, surrounded by stacks of papers and textbooks. The faint smell of stale coffee lingers in the air, mingling with the dust motes that dance in the weak light filtering through the window.“I may be too old to march on campus with a sign,” he muses to himself, fingers tapping nervously on his desk. “But I can still make an impact.” In an unexpected twist, he believes he has found a way to empower his students through personal connections—albeit through morally questionable means. One afternoon, as the sun dipped low in the sky, casting long shadows across the campus grounds, Sophie—a bright but overwhelmed student—approached him. Her hazel eyes shimmered with desperation as she stood at his office door, her hands nervously twisting the hem of her shirt.“Is there anything I can do to pass your class?” she asked timidly, her voice barely above a whisper.John’s mind raced as he contemplated her request. The lines between mentorship and manipulation blurred in his thoughts. “Perhaps there’s an alternative,” he suggested, his voice smooth yet laced with ulterior motives.



As they engaged in increasingly inappropriate encounters under the guise of academic support, John rationalized his actions as a means to empower Sophie and others like her. Yet beneath this facade lay a darker truth—one that echoed through the corridors of power where exploitation often masqueraded as opportunity.Meanwhile, Jack Thompson—a factory worker returning home after another grueling day—pulled into his driveway only to be greeted by an unsettling sight. His seven-year-old daughter, Emily, stood alone in the fading light, her pigtails swaying gently in the breeze. The evening air was thick with humidity, clinging to him like an unwelcome shroud.“Hey, pumpkin!” he called out, stepping from his truck with unease creeping over him. The gravel crunched underfoot as he approached her. But something felt wrong; her cheerful demeanor seemed hollow against the backdrop of twilight As Jack drew closer, horror gripped him—Emily’s legs were gone. Her torso hovered eerily above the ground, her smile fixed unnaturally on her face.“Daddy,” she said sweetly, as if nothing were amiss. “I waited for you.”

Jack’s heart raced as panic surged through him. “What happened to you?” he gasped, scanning their yard for any sign of rationality or safety.“Mommy’s inside,” Emily replied calmly, her voice devoid of emotion With dread pooling in his stomach like lead, Jack rushed into the house only to be met with chaos—a scene that shattered his reality. Blood splattered across walls; furniture lay overturned amidst wreckage. The metallic scent filled his nostrils as he stepped further inside.“Oh God,” he whispered as he stumbled into the living room.And there on the couch was Lisa—his wife—her body twisted grotesquely in unnatural contortions. Jack’s breath caught in his throat as he took in the horror before him.“What the hell is this?” he gasped as Emily floated into view behind him, her hands stained crimson.“I told you I waited for you,” she giggled innocently. As Jack grappled with despair and confusion, he realized that this nightmare reflected not just his personal tragedy but also a broader commentary on power dynamics within families and society at large. The shadows lurking behind Emily’s smile revealed an ancient hunger for control and dominance—a chilling reminder of how easily innocence could be corrupted.



In parallel, John’s justifications for his actions began to unravel as Sophie’s initial enthusiasm turned into fear and regret. What began as an exploration of intimacy devolved into manipulation—a betrayal that left scars far deeper than any physical mark could inflict. Both men found themselves at pivotal crossroads: Jack had to confront the monstrous reality of what had happened to his family while John faced the consequences of his misguided attempts at empowerment. As their stories intertwined, they illuminated how authority could become destructive when wielded irresponsibly.The atmosphere grew heavier around Jack as he attempted to process what had unfolded before him. Each breath felt like a weight pressing down on his chest; every sound echoed ominously within the confines of his mind. He staggered backward until he collided with a wall for support—the cold surface grounding him momentarily amidst chaos.“Emily!” he shouted desperately; fear clawed at his throat like a wild animal seeking escape from its cage. “What did you do?”Her face twisted grotesquely; eyes glowed faintly in the dim light—a sickly green hue that sent chills racing down Jack's spine. “I’m your daughter,” she said softly as her form began to shift and warp before his eyes—her innocence melting away like wax under heat. “Don’t you love me?”Jack's vision blurred; darkness threatened to swallow him whole while Emily's laughter filled the room—a high-pitched sound that felt utterly wrong against this backdrop of horror. 



In another part of town, John sat alone in his office late at night—papers strewn about haphazardly like fragments of his conscience laid bare before him. He could still hear Sophie’s voice echoing in his mind: “Is there anything I can do?” His stomach churned with guilt; each moment spent justifying his actions felt heavier than before—the weight pressing down until it became unbearable. He reached for a cup of coffee left cold on his desk but recoiled at its bitter taste—reminding him too much of regret.The next day dawned gray and foreboding; rain drizzled down from heavy clouds like tears falling from an unseen eye watching over them all. Jack awoke in a hospital bed days later—or so they told him—but there was no sign of Lisa or Emily remaining; only echoes haunted him like ghosts refusing to let go.They called it a breakdown—a result of being overworked and hallucinating from stress—but deep down inside him lingered an unsettling certainty that something far more sinister had transpired that night at home.



Meanwhile, John faced Sophie once more; she stood before him trembling slightly—her hazel eyes filled with unshed tears reflecting betrayal mixed with anger.“You used me!” she accused softly yet fiercely; each word cut through John like shards of glass piercing flesh—a painful reminder that trust had been shattered irreparably between them.“I thought I was helping you,” he stammered defensively—the words tasting bitter on his tongue even before they left it.“But at what cost?” she retorted angrily; pain radiated from her voice like heat waves rising off asphalt during summer heat—a reminder that every action has consequences beyond mere intentions. As both men faced their respective demons—Jack haunted by visions of Emily’s smile twisted into something monstrous while John grappled with Sophie’s betrayal—they were left pondering profound questions about morality and authority: What does it mean to truly empower others without losing oneself? In a world rife with inequality and exploitation where shadows lurked behind every corner waiting patiently for their chance to strike—perhaps confronting one’s own darkness becomes essential not just for survival but also redemption amidst chaos surrounding them both.

1gviqyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1gviqyv/finally_hit_2m_a_few_days_before_my_30th_bday_as/,Finally hit 2M a few days before my 30th bday as a SINK.,"Have no one to share this news with. It feels surreal, $2m had been my goal for the last 3 years. I hit $1M in early 2020. Some reflections:

**Being lucky**: I do feel like a lot of this, maybe most of it, came down to a tremendous amount of luck. In particular,

* Getting a full ride scholarship for undergrad and graduating with \~$50k saved up from on-campus jobs / internships
* Joining a FANG company right out of college in 2016 when the tech industry was hiring and paying like crazy (I honestly was not even good at programming. I didn't major in CS and I barely knew how to code)
* Being naturally frugal from having grown up poor. Getting on the investing train early and dumping everything into VTSAX since college (did stupidly dabble in options trading in 2020 and lost money but stopped)
* Buying a single-family home in a HCOL city when interest rates were sub-3% (though I did miss out on the low prices in 2019/2020). At this time I was dating my ex-boyfriend and thankfully we were in vastly different financial positions so I bought my place solo

**Relationships are everything**: I don't know why it took me so f\*cking late to learn this.

Money doesn't buy happiness if you have nobody to share it with. Everything feels meaningless alone. I love the idea of buying/building a nice vacation home somewhere, but I don't see the point when I have nobody to share it with. Same with nice vacations. Or going out to nice restaurants.

I spent my life until my late twenties being accomplishment-oriented and grinding at work. Always being 'ambitious' and 'productive'. Then at age 28, I got laid off and fell into a spiral. It was a deeply disorienting time, but I realized the only things that really truly matter are my health and my family and friends.

Right now, my dream is to find my life partner. I am pretty pessimistic that this will actually happen, but I would love to share my life with somebody and look back in our 60s at the life we'd built together.

**Old habits die hard**: I am still frugal af but this is something I'm working on.

I recently read Die With Zero (recommended by this sub, ty!) and it was eye-opening. Especially since I don't plan to have kids and I don't have any siblings. I still cringe at ""wasting money"" by eating out. I still shop around for hours to save $10. I'll still buy the inferior version of a product because it's cheaper even though the higher quality product would bring me more joy.

The behavior I'm especially trying to change now is:

a) splurging more on life's little treats. I still feel so much guilt/anxiety about eating out and spending $20 - $30 on a meal, even though I logically know it's ridiculous. Especially considering how much joy that meal brings for only $20-30.

b) being a lot more generous with family and friends. This kind of goes hand-in-hand with the lesson I learned above that ""relationships are everything"". I used to never treat my friends out when they got a job or had a birthday. I was always so stingy. Now, I take them to a nice restaurant and spend $100-$200. Tbh I do still get anxious about this spend, but the way I've framed it is by asking myself to place a hypothetical monetary value on the friendship. If I had to spend a certain amount of money to buy this friendship, how much would I pay? For my close friends, that money is ridiculously high and way above $100. So all things considered, paying $100 to treat them out on their birthday is such a bargain.  There are things in life that money can't buy, and friendship is one of them.

**No ambitions anymore / internalizing that I've already ""won"" / feeling like I'm 60 on the inside:** Everything in life is so \*chill\*.

I don't really have any ambitions in my life anymore except to have a good day every day and to enjoy the small simple things like a fresh cup of coffee, going for a morning walk, chatting on the phone with a friend, etc.

I do have things I want to do like explore cooking different cuisines, learning how to play the guitar, etc. but I feel zero pressure about them and don't feel like I need to ""get anywhere"" with them except to simply enjoy them. In some sense, I feel like I'm a 60-year old retiree. Which might be a bad thing because part of me thinks I should have more drive towards something. But I feel so much more contentedness and peace. But also sometimes some loneliness I guess from not having the distraction of being preoccupied with something.

I don't care about work or career anymore. Which is a drastic change in my life because if you knew me before my late twenties, work/career/salary dominated my life. After getting laid off, I worked at another FANG company for 6 months, it was toxic, I quit, and now work at a much slower much less stressful (and much less paying lol) job. However, even at this job, I feel a sense of security/relief from my NW. I don't care about getting promoted. I only want to enjoy my day-to-day work and work with enjoyable people. I used to worry all the time about getting fired, sometimes even having panic attacks, but now I don't care. If I get fired, I know I'll be ok because of my NW and I'll find some other job after a break.

**Not really having anything to spend the money on:**

Part of the chillness I guess is from realizing there's nothing I'd really do with the extra money. I have a car, a house, I don't plan to have kids, and I'm a homebody who's not really into traveling or fancy luxurious things. My actual FIRE number is probably $3M (because my monthly mortgage is over 5k). Tbh I don't know what I'd do with myself if I didn't work, especially being single and living alone. I would love to reach $3M though to feel true security and will probably splurge more when that happens (eg renting a nice apartment in Manhattan for the summer to experience NYC life). My next milestones are $2.5M and $3M.

**Turning 30:** This was a hell of a decade (in both good and bad ways, mostly good) and I'm excited for my 30s. I feel like I finally feel more self-confident and know what my values are. Definitely feel extremely lucky to be entering my 30s with this financial safety net. Looking forward, I want to invest more in my friendships and continue enjoying the simple things in every day.

This was a gratuitously long post, cheers if you made it this far. Thanks for being an awesome sub and I hope to have an update post in 10 years when I'm about to turn 40 :)",13,1732081840.0,ChubbyFIRE,5,0.93,False
1gviqpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/1gviqpb/what_are_your_cowash_routines/,What are your co-wash routines?,"I have wash day nailed down. Now I need to figure out co-wash day. I can't wash my hair more than once a week, my fine/2c to 3a/high porosity hair hates it. 

If I don't co-wash, natural oil and product buildup weighs down my roots and scalp itches ever so slightly. 

Co-washing mid-week is that sweet spot but I face either too much product weighing it down (because it isn't a complete wash) with the LOC method or not enough product to retain moisture for the rest of the week till wash day. 

My co-wash routine is:
- Use warm water and scalp scrubber to open pores and lift buildup. 
- Spray rice water and coffee for a pre wash.
- Rinse and use comb and scalp scrub again (it feels so good!)
- Apply Garnier Fructis Pure Clean conditioner to the length (I have used this with great success, so I don't think this is the problem)
- Apply lighter amounts of L (currently some keratin silk leave in), Garnier fructis argan oil, and loreal curl cream.

After doing this, the problem is not the scalp or roots, they're fine. The problem is the length.

I'm just curious what other people do so I can browse and pick what might work for me. I also would like suggestions on whether I should leave post-wash products out or what to keep. Goal is to protect length with moisture without weighing it down till next wash day. Thanks! Look forward to your secrets.",1,1732081812.0,curlyhair,1,1.0,False

I might get addicted to them, but I'd rather feel in my body than out of it.

What Can I Do?,"I've (29F) been with my partner (33M) for a little over three months and have known him for almost a year at this point. He's been a wonderful partner and I think we're incredibly well-matched. But for some reason, this past week he's felt like a stranger to me, and it's giving me overwhelming anxiety. I don't know what to do to make it go away but I feel insane. 

For context, I've had a lot of trauma in my past, and I'm sure that's playing a role in this. It tends to take a long time for me to get close to people, especially men. However, my boyfriend is literally everything I could ask for - he's attentive, intelligent, thoughtful, and patient. He's got a quirky, happy-go-lucky personality that counterbalances my stormy disposition well, and my friends love him. I love him. I feel like we truly see and understand each other in ways that others don't. We can talk for hours about seemingly anything. We have difficult conversations but we don't fight. Until this moment, I've been filled with this unwavering confidence of ""this is it, this is my person."" 

Prior to this spontaneous feeling of stranger-ness, the last time we'd hung out was Thursday night on a double date with my friend and her gf. I'd made some joke about how on our first date, he'd said some out-of-pocket thing that made me think, ""Either this man is insane or he's the one I'm going to marry."" Without missing a beat he said, ""Now we know it's both."" At the time I felt like I was glowing; I felt so much love for him, and couldn't believe my luck in finding someone this perfect. My friend texted me to tell me how great she thought he was.

Friday was fine; I spent the morning at his house and it was the usual routine of morning sex and then napping in his bed while he took a work call. He brought me coffee in bed. I was smitten. 

Then Saturday rolled around and I felt....nothing. Nothing except for this strange emptiness and an overwhelming anxiety that he was a stranger and I didn't even like him, let alone love him. I told him I needed the day to myself and he was kind and understanding, as always. Sunday rolled around and the empty feeling persisted and grew. 

He came over tonight, and we made dinner and talked like usual, but I felt like I was watching from just outside of myself, or that I was thrown into some strange and unfamiliar role and was poorly improvising. Then I started to feel overwhelmingly anxious as the feeling didn't subside. The feeling was so jarring and disparate from what I normally feel with him that I wanted to crawl out of my skin and cry. I genuinely, objectively think the world of him. But as we were talking and laughing I just kept looking at him and thinking, ""I don't know who you are, at all,"" and it scared me. 

Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do? I have no intention of breaking things off because this is clearly a me issue, and I know rationally that I am head over heels in love with him, but I hate feeling this way. ",1,1732081561.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

20 minutes to take her to work and also

I am planning to visit Costa Rica with the wife and a 3 year old in Dec for about 9-10 days. Our flights are to and from Liberia airport and we'll have a rental car throughout. Here is what we are currently planning:

Day 1 - We land in the late afternoon, so probably catch the sunset at Playa Hermosa and head to an Airbnb in Playa Flamingo.

Day 2 - Probably chill at the beach and explore some places nearby.

Day 3 - Drive to Monteverde and take the afternoon cloud forest tour (probably Santa Elena guided tour) followed by the night walk (Monteverde).

Day 4 - After an early morning coffee and chocolate tour, drive to Manuel Antonio and stay the night.

Day 5 - Visit the Manuel Antonio National park and maybe explore the beach in the evening.

Day 6 - Drive up to La Fortuna (will probably visit the Poas volcano on the way)

Day 7 - Mistico Hanging bridges and La Fortuna waterfall.

Day 8 - Rio Celeste and Tabacon hot springs.

Day 9 - Arenal volcano/lava view trails and probably sky adventure air tram.

Day 10 will just be travelling from La Fortuna to Liberia airport to catch the flight, so nothing that day. 

I know this may be somewhat strenuous, but we usually travel like this. But of course, I would like to know if this is impractical. On the other hand, with a kid, we can't really do too many adventure activities, so rafting, scuba, ziplining etc. is a little difficult to accommodate. I would love to hear from you all if this sounds practical or if we should make any changes.

Also, I had some questions here:

1. Santa Elena cloud forest website is entirely in Spanish, but we only speak English. Are the guided tours in Spanish or English?

2. Should we drive from Playa Flamingo to Monteverde on Day 1? Spend only one night in Flamingo and 2 nights in Monte Verde?

Thank you! Really looking forward to this trip.

I'm in my late twenties and want to maximise my cognition and memory. I work out 4-5 days a week and eat healthy.

- Magnesium glycinate
- Zinc
- Thorne Daily nutrients 
- Fish oil
- N-Acetyl-l-Carnitine
- Green tea extract/EGCG
- Coffee in the morning

- Boron (made me edgy and smelly)
- Modafinil (not interested in using again)
- Melatonin (not really a nootropic but because it actually helps me sleep it boosts my cognitive capacity considerably)


Lion's Mane had a great impact on my memory and made recall much smoother/faster, along with the details and number of my memories. I generally felt like a much more intelligent version of myself on it. However, it makes my sex drive borderline non-existent and I lose the benefits when I stop it.


I'm interested in:

1gvif5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gvif5l/maximizing_small_spaces_compact_furniture/,Maximizing Small Spaces: Compact Furniture Solutions That Work,"Living in a smaller home or apartment doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or functionality. With the right furniture solutions, you can maximize your space and create a home that feels open, organized, and inviting. From clever storage ideas to multifunctional pieces, here’s how to make the most of every square foot—whether indoors or outdoors.

**1. Start with Multifunctional Furniture**

Investing in furniture that serves multiple purposes is a game-changer for small spaces. Look for items like a sofa bed, nesting tables, or a dining table with built-in storage. These pieces save space and add versatility, ensuring your home adapts to your needs.

For outdoor spaces, consider [balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) like foldable tables and stackable chairs. These compact options make it easy to enjoy your balcony for meals, relaxation, or entertaining, without cluttering the space.

**2. Choose Space-Saving Outdoor Furniture**

Even small outdoor areas like balconies or patios can be transformed with the right pieces. Look for sleek, modern designs that offer comfort without overwhelming your space. For example:

[Outdoor benches](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/rattan-benches) with hidden storage are perfect for keeping cushions, gardening tools, or blankets tucked away while providing additional seating.

Foldable or collapsible [outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) can be stored easily when not in use, leaving your space open for other activities.

These thoughtful additions allow you to create an outdoor retreat without compromising on functionality.

**3. Opt for Vertical Storage**

When floor space is limited, go vertical. Wall-mounted shelves, tall bookcases, and pegboards can add plenty of storage while freeing up valuable ground area. For outdoor spaces, install hooks or vertical planters to maximize your balcony or patio’s potential. Pairing this approach with compact balcony furniture ensures a tidy and organized look.

**4. Incorporate Modular and Lightweight Designs**

Modular furniture allows you to reconfigure your space as needed. This is especially handy for small living rooms or outdoor areas. Choose lightweight materials for easy movement—this is ideal for rearranging your balcony or patio layout depending on the occasion.

**5. Use Transparent and Minimalistic Designs**

Opt for furniture with slim profiles or transparent materials like acrylic or glass. These create the illusion of space while maintaining a chic and modern aesthetic. An outdoor bench with a minimalistic design, for instance, adds style without overcrowding your patio.

**6. Add Foldable Outdoor Furniture for Flexibility**

Balconies and patios often have limited space, making foldable furniture an excellent option. Look for compact chairs and tables that can be stored or hung on the wall when not in use. These solutions keep your space adaptable for entertaining guests or enjoying a peaceful evening alone.

**7. Choose Furniture with Built-in Storage**

Maximizing storage is crucial in small spaces. Coffee tables, beds, and benches with built-in compartments help declutter your home while maintaining functionality. For outdoor use, outdoor benches with storage allow you to keep your patio neat and stylish.

**Final Thoughts**

Maximizing small spaces requires creativity and the right furniture solutions. Compact and multifunctional furniture can turn even the tiniest balcony, patio, or room into a practical and beautiful space. With options like space-saving outdoor furniture, stylish balcony furniture, and functional outdoor benches, you can make every inch of your home work for you.

Thanks for taking the time to help guide my journey.  
I Have a superauto and ready to take this hobby seriously.   
Seeking above mentioned budget with room to wiggle and want “room to grow” (in regards to creativity)
I’m a total newbie but have passion and desire which in turn leads me to want a machine and grinder that tolerates incompetence but allows me to go all the way to advanced. 
I’ve searched and searched on this forum to learn what I can.    I’m still not fully understanding the full grasp of what everything means. 
What I’ve gathered is most will slander me for having a large budget and admittedly knowing nothing in regards to the science of this sport.  I’m willing to accept the criticism but hope some are willing to take the time to help and explain.
We drink all types of drinks.  
Budget is of concern (but minor at that). 

My wish list (machine)
1) heats (somewhat) quickly to very quickly 
2) tolerates incompetence but has no limit with creativity as I develop and learn. 
3) longevity:   I’m a buy once cry once kinda guy.  Don’t mind spending money for the best.    As long as it lasts.  
4) I hate computers (if that means anything in this sport)

My wish list (grinder)
1) it lasts and it works as you suggest it should for a machine that costs what I’m about to spend. 

Lastly:
I’m able to afford (very blessed) hobbies.   My wife tolerates my hobbies because they aren’t related to leaving town with the fellas, ignoring the family, etc.  

I realize I’m so extremely new to this game.   However when I start something I don’t stop.  I’ve been seeking a new hobby and I love coffee.   So this fits like a gem.  

I’m sorry if my post is offensive or seems disingenuous.   I truly ask for your help.   I’m pulling the trigger either way, however would like to do so with your advice vs without it. 

Machines that seem to strike my interest from reading this forum:

-la Morzoccra micra
-lelit bianca
-profitec 600
-and so many others

1gvicjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingtoNewJersey/comments/1gvicjl/hello_nj_from_texas/,Hello NJ! (From Texas),"Hello!

I had posted 2 months ago to get a better feel of the possibility of moving to NJ, but now, it's official: we will be moving to The Garden State in Summer 2025. To prepare, we are planning on visiting for 4-5 days in early January and I hope to visit all the potential towns that we could be calling home by this time next year. 

Hubby and I have compiled a list of possible towns, but as it's based on only what we could find online, I thought it would be a good idea to bring it to you all and get more accurate feedback:

Edison - default, because it's right there  
Piscataway - default, because it's right there  
New Providence  
Berkeley Heights  
Watchung  
Metuchen  
Westfield  
Matawan - only added because a future co-worker lives there

Some things about us and what we're looking for -- 

* We're a family of 4 with kids ages 8 and 4 by the time we move there. As such, we are focusing on good schools up to at least Middle School and places with family-friendly activities. (We knocked some towns off because the online ratings didn't look great, but I also see the same for some schools here that have a good reputation, so I don't think online ratings are very accurate, but it's what we have right now. All input welcome from those who know.) We, the adults, are in our mid to late 30s. We like nature, adventures, and prefer coffee/tea over alcohol.
* Hubby will need to commute to Piscataway 1-3 times a week and would prefer the commute to be no longer than 30 minutes. I work remotely. 
* Budget isn't currently known (or accurate), because I can't seem to find specifics on what the property tax would be up there - it seems to be dependent on the town? I found some decent information on what to expect on income tax, though. For now, we're looking at maybe $500-600k, but $500k to be safe until we can figure out everything else. Can anyone point me in the right direction so I can better calculate our budget?
* We'd prefer a single family home, but will consider a townhouse if the location checks off most of our preferences and meets the budget. It would also be awesome if the town had a degree of walkability and be close to a train station. If we're going to move halfway across the country, might as well make it as different as we can! 
* I have read some other posts here and some people brought up preferring diverse communities and others mentioned that there are areas in NJ that aren't very accepting of certain groups. This never occurred to me until I read those comments. I'm Asian American (originally from California) while my husband immigrated here in his teens from Taiwan. Are there certain areas we should avoid looking into or is it just a simple case of there are bad apples everywhere?
* We currently live in Houston and are familiar with storms, hurricanes, and flooding, but we've never personally experienced the flooding ourselves (only watched from a window). What are some areas to avoid that have had \[repeat/any\] issues with flooding recently or is it on a house-by-house basis? 
* This isn't a criteria, but a question: does anyone know what is needed when transferring kids to a school in NJ? Anything I would need to get from their current school, like transcript, etc, since we're still here? I assume we would also need a NJ address so this is a ways out.
* Question No. 2: I'm looking at these distances from surrounding towns and they're only about 13 miles away from Piscataway, but I'm seeing 30 minute drive times at... 11 PM. So I must ask - what is the average speed limit over there? Are these local roads? The same distance here could be made in a little less than 20 minutes at 11 PM, but this does vary depending on the proximity to a highway. What am I missing?

  
Please let me know if any of the places on our list need to be removed and/or if any should be added in for our little tour.  Maybe a max of 10 towns to visit since we have young kids in a relatively short period of time. 

A few more questions that just occurred to me --  
Is it easy enough to just park the car and roam the streets in every town to get a good feel for it or are there actual destinations we should look out for? Anything we should keep in mind for our first Actual Winter as a family, even if it's for a few days? What keeps you warm? One of my kids gets cold easily. She thinks Houston is cold enough for her, but she's intrigued by the idea of snow. (Husband, Kid #2, and I enjoy the cold, though we'll see if it applies to Actual Winters when we live there.)

I'm a working professional. When I am not working, I volunteer, exercise, visit the local markets, cook, binge on horror/psych thriller movies/shows, read, and maybe write a little. I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). I'm open to dark jokes. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

No limits on your location, relationship status, employment status, native language, age, ethnicity, religion, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too 👻

Music is a big part of his life and he’s very into hardcore lately. Some bands I’ve heard him mention recently are Drain, Knocked Loose, Year of the Knife, and Dying Wish.

He is also into adjacent(?) genres like post hardcore, nu-metal, and your general heavy metal. He’s also the drummer for an emo band and is very supportive of the local scene. He loves going to shows, stage-diving, moshing/dancing, all that stuff. 

I am a pop girlie, so all of this is pretty out of my wheelhouse, but I’d love to get him something he’s not expecting. He already owns so many band T-shirts and I am at a loss.

Fun facts that may be helpful: he’s in his 30’s, everyone at his corporate job (where he fits in) is always confused when they find out he’s into “intense” music, he is obsessed with our little dog, and he volunteers with an animal rescue. He’s into horror movies, coffee, and podcasts like Last Podcast on the Left.

A scoundrel self enthusiast landing cool remarks to the sadists of poetry, The Dunes, during their performance. Now cool in the eaves of the AMARR Moving truck had slept over 3hree weeks up to the current date. Flashing night seat rollies in the current of the ebbing mountain breeze. Eron, Richard Eron, was still alive, and you were in trouble if you bekame his ka tonight. To others his dark drift might seem appropriate, but today his tiger eyes were awake and looking for the neck of the next, ""victim""? R Eron was ready and out for blood in the parking lot of Tips For Us Coffee House. 

         Inside thhe Coffee house, Tony Cheng was just dying to get into the bathroom next. Sarena was quiete as usual. Paying for the house coffees and tucking her coat tails into her black jeans. They figured they two were like coffee. One from far East North. And One from far East South West. Like Carmel cream and dark like the bases, The Dunes were a celebratory wait mixed with celebratory need to change, and a little bit of common fleeting senses in her poetry. They wrote 'Revolutionary Poetry' and were quite popular among The Tips Crowd, a common local coffee goer in this ""24th Year of 2000"" or so they had put it. There message was a gloss of tiddly winks that made the message of ""inciting revolution!"" And cool noise poems about love making. As many as 20 people, and some stragglers, would come. The hipsters would swallow coffee beangravy and milky milky to there stomachs turn rotten. Rolling Dusty RTobacco. Their hands and lips  orange from the consistency. 

       The Dune had finished for the night but avarage 15 people still there. Tony and Salena were having a moment with the fellow community the Awkwardness of Goodbyes. Tony was near hammering his white tight fists waiting for bathroom. He must of held it during the entire two hour performance. 

Diane: ""What a wonderful prose.. Poetry that can take you into the vision of a ""Revolutionary""""

Rick: ""I see what you mean; the idea that someone could see ""Revolution"" and face it through love!""

Ian""What are you talking about? ""Revolution""? You cant invision a Revolutionist and you cant invent a way to ""Glance and invision for every Revolutionary is true"" what the fuck is that?!""

     At this moment Sarena, Diane, Tony and Rick were all focusing on Ian and his advantageous statements. Withholding some counter point energy, a feeling of very alien to Sarena and Tony. S&T began to get pouty. Ian continued on.

Ian: ""A ""Revolutionary"" isn't the same as an artist, though some can equip both. Some of these pro artists dont know the first thing about their craft. Neither of them is NIGH nor ZEN. Neither will be each other. You can Cause Revolution and movement through art, however much of art has about nothing to do with revolution.""

Sarena; ""ugh Hmm. 🫢""

Diana: ""let him start..""

Ian: ""Revolution comes from the heart of drive and continuance. The message comes to the artist not the art directed at the viewer.""

Rick: ""Is that like, destiny?""

Ian: ""Only things we look into the past that have been achieved can we call ""destiny"". Revlution is an act of drive and movement and goal. Not love circulations. Look, i like your Poetry Salena and Donty. But im not into the wave, you hold, not drive. What is your point? ""We should make love not war?"" Please. 2wo and a half hours of you guys inciting sex. In what way is that Revolutionary or on Point? R Eron had the right idea to mock you. And you know what they can kick me out like a fascist cup shop fpr saying this but, Ragu is not Blood.""

Tony: ""You got a lot of nerve!""

Sarena: ""...""

Diana: ""ian's going crazy! What is with you? I thought it was a good performance.""

Ian: ""oh! Look with your eyes. What happened to def jam night? When other artists get the chance to mic check what's on their minds?! What about the artists that want to be heard? Not all this unclear sexu.""

Sarena: ""Are you a racist!?""

     At this point ian knew just what to do.

Rick: ""Hey man lets go, you probably want to-""

Ian: ""Fuck You You ORiental Queef!!""

Cup Master: ""That's It Ian You Are Banned 7 Days !!!""

    Ian stress flicked his mohawk and called Sarena and Tony ""Bitches"" as he left Tips Shit Coffee Gravy. The cast of the great cold Winter night was so welcoming compared to the bean gravy yelpers. 

Ian: ""Fuck them and fuck their Orient."" [To Himself] ""Eron would have...""

      That's when ian saw it. Just in the light of cascade from the headlights of a upcoming car behind ian. Ian saw two reflecting eye shaped reflections from the shadow next to the okd tag truck. It looked like an all black demon with only eyes a lit. Ian said to himself, ""What the.."" and foolishly approached the demon to tame and make friends with him. Ian approaches calmly with an ember orange lit cigarrete to illuminate the shadowed eave of the night in the oparking lot of Tip us. 

Ian: ""R Eron?""

R Eron: ""Its me john. How you been?""

Isn: ""Did you just see that? Ive been banned also.""

R Eron: ""These pricks are making everything socialistic. I cant live with a fascist coffee spot being illegalized by thesse foreigners. I can feel it. Im going to explode EO. Im feeling like these two arent going to let me in. You'd let me in, wouldnt you E?""

Eo: ""Yeah mate. Its cool. I got kicked out too. You think they r turning socialist What the fuck.!?""

R Eron: ""Fuck this! Quiete down, ive been waiting for them to come out. Theyll fome out i know it. Fucking Socialists!""

     A passing car travels through the parking lot to leave. Its getting past 10:34 and R Eron wanted revenge. Waiting in the dark with Ian sparking his pipe. Wofts of marijuana smoke being highlighted by the parking lights. The darkness was met with both of them. Darkness held them in Goth remorse. About to exhume the intent of a coffe freak startup. R Eron was pissed in his dark seldom attitude. Ian relaxed easy ad ever. 

R Eron: ""are you ready ian?""

Ian: ""do I look ready?""

R Eron: ""Rrrr""

    To this Ian nodded and watched the door.  Seems like to ught was packed with drama. Inside the Tips coffee shop Sarena was every expecting to leave. the atmosphere was ""Dredge"" to her. Tony still waiting for the bathroom. When suddenly a grey bearded hipster walked into the bathroom wearing a leather jacket. Apparently the bathroom wasn't occupied after all. But it was now. Tony was going to explode. Now he had to wait even longer.

Tony: ""Listen, Salena, why dont we go? Ill hold it, been holding it log, whats another few minutes?""

Sarena:""My name is Serena!""

     The atmosphere at Tips was incredibly fugal at this point. So Serena jumped out of her seat and stormed out the door making a scene. Tony fallowed her. Both not comprehending what was about to revolve their belief in whatever constitution they have paved. They left coursing left around the building right to where R Eron and Ian had been posted. And now R Ereon unleashed his terror. Coming out of the Shadows with a surprising ""Hey!"" R Eron unveils from the descendant shadows;

R Eron: ""What could brighten the night? More often than one a night such as this? This becoming the two Ive been waiting to counter and dismiss? How I am, I have already started! What is the ponder and wonder of surprise you hold in your third and four eyes? Now i see that you are here like a wandering-tree, let me be the axe that divides thee. Five great syllables and you are so done you wouldnt understand for six month...

Sarena and R Eron battled on, standing for what they thought they should fight about long into the evening. Tony scampered off leaving it two on one for Strong Sarena The Northern Blade. She was defeated. Left to go home with the ferocious need to create against these pugilistic shadow monsters. R Eron and Ian became great friends that night.

The right rug can tie a room together, add warmth, and even define spaces in open layouts. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to find the perfect rug for every room. This guide will help you navigate the choices, whether you're looking for [rugs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), practical [outdoor rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/textiles/outdoor-rugs), or a visit to a trusted [rugs store Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs).

**1. Living Room: Anchor Your Space**

In the living room, rugs help create a cozy, inviting atmosphere while grounding your furniture. Here are some tips for selecting the ideal rug:  

Size Matters: Opt for a rug that’s large enough to fit under your sofa and coffee table. A common rule is to have at least the front legs of furniture on the rug.  

Material Choices: Choose durable yet soft materials like wool or synthetic blends for high-traffic areas.  

Design Style: Neutral tones or geometric patterns work well in modern spaces, while bohemian or Persian-inspired designs add character to eclectic interiors.

**2. Dining Room: Style Meets Practicality**

A dining room rug should enhance the space while standing up to spills and stains.  

Size: Ensure the rug is large enough so that all dining chairs remain on the rug even when pulled out.  

Material: Go for easy-to-clean options like polypropylene or low-pile rugs.  

Patterns: Bold patterns can hide accidental stains, making them a practical choice.  

For homes in Dubai, consider rugs that are lightweight and easy to maintain, especially if the dining area transitions to outdoor spaces.

**3. Bedroom: Soft and Luxurious Comfort**

A rug in the bedroom should evoke comfort and warmth underfoot.  

Placement: Position the rug under the bed, leaving enough exposed around the sides and foot.  

Material: Plush options like shag rugs or wool create a cozy feel.  

Style: Choose colors and patterns that complement your bedding and overall décor theme.

**4. Outdoor Spaces: Durability is Key**

For balconies, patios, or garden seating areas, outdoor rugs are a must-have.  

Material: Look for weather-resistant materials like polypropylene or jute that can withstand Dubai's heat and occasional sandstorms.  

Design: Outdoor rugs now come in a wide range of patterns, from tropical vibes to minimalist designs.  

Care: Choose rugs that are easy to clean with a quick rinse or wipe-down.  

Outdoor rugs can transform your exterior spaces into cozy extensions of your home.

**5. Kitchen: Functional and Stylish**

While often overlooked, a rug in the kitchen can provide comfort and a pop of style.  

Material: Opt for flatweave rugs that are easy to clean and don’t trap dirt.  

Placement: Runners work well along countertops or islands.  

Patterns: Striped or patterned rugs can hide wear and tear from frequent use.

**Where to Find the Best Rugs in Dubai**  

When shopping for rugs, Dubai offers a plethora of options. From modern designs to traditional patterns, you’ll find everything you need at a reliable rugs store in Dubai. Look for stores that offer a variety of materials, sizes, and styles to suit every room in your home. Many stores also carry specialized collections of outdoor rugs, perfect for Dubai's lifestyle.

**Final Thoughts**  

Choosing the perfect rug for your home requires careful consideration of size, material, design, and functionality. By keeping these tips in mind, you can select rugs that enhance your interiors while meeting the specific needs of each room. Whether you’re decorating a cozy apartment or a luxurious villa, Dubai’s vibrant rug market has something for everyone.

1gvi2o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gvi2o5/am_i_being_used_or_just_overthinking/,Am I Being Used or Just Overthinking?,"
I’m a 23-year-old woman who recently started dating a 29-year-old man I met at university. From the beginning, our connection felt magnetic, driven by shared interests and a kind of chemistry that made the idea of being together almost effortless. Yet despite this initial spark, I began to feel a vague sense of unease, an inner tension that I couldn’t quite place. My feminine energy, something I’ve always felt in tune with, seemed constrained, almost suffocated, when I was around him. It was a feeling entirely new to me.

For weeks, I wrestled with this discomfort, unable to identify the source. It felt like an emotional void, a lack of the warmth and desire I expected to feel. Then it dawned on me: he had never truly pursued me. From the very start, he made a point of expressing dissatisfaction with how I matched his energy, often implying that my affection fell short of his. No matter how attentive or engaged I tried to be, his dissatisfaction lingered, as if he was testing me, waiting for me to fail. It became clear that he had expectations I was somehow failing to meet, even when I believed I was offering him my best…

His life circumstances only complicated matters. As an international student, he is under significant pressure, not only from the demands of his studies but also from the bureaucratic complexities of applying for a green card. During one of our dates, he spoke at length about the weight of his struggles, even hinting that if i were to “allow” myself to portray my “love,” it could make it all more bearable. The way he said it unnerved me. It felt manipulative, as though he was assigning me the role of emotional caretaker, asking me to become responsible for his stability. Given my own experience as an immigrant, I empathized with his hardship. However, I couldn’t ignore this unsettling sense that he was asking me to shoulder a burden that wasn’t mine to carry, …yet…?

Over time, his behavior suggested that he wasn’t drawn to me for who I am but rather for a version of me that fit a role he needed filled. It felt transactional, as though he had assessed me against a checklist of attributes necessary for the life he envisioned for himself in the U.S. This realization left me feeling objectified, like a tool rather than a cherished partner. It was deeply unsettling, and quite literally a signal that I was being valued not for my essence but for my utility.

Adding to this complexity was something he confessed early on: he had just come out of an eight-year relationship, breaking up with his ex about a year before we met, due to him getting accepted into a university at the USA. It lingered in the back of my mind, this nagging thought: can someone truly move on that fast from a relationship that long and deep? His readiness to start something new made me wonder if he was genuinely healed or if he was simply trying to fill a void.

Despite all of this, I found myself caught in a familiar loop: I’ve always cherished balance and reciprocity in relationships, and the role reversal with him was exhausting. He seemed to expect constant reassurance, as if my love needed to be proven over and over, while he put forth only minimal effort. It’s not that I subscribe to the belief that men should always pursue women, but this dynamic felt fundamentally wrong. His demands were relentless, and my desire to accommodate him, to prove I cared, was draining me.

Then, he disappeared without explanation, ignoring me for three days. His sudden silence was suffocating, a heavy cloud of anxiety and confusion. Finally, I reached out, swallowing my pride to check if he was okay and to express that disappearing like that isn’t normal in a serious relationship. I asked to meet and discuss things, and he agreed.

When I arrived at the café, his demeanor was cold-ish. I bought us coffee and asked him what had happened. He admitted he hadn’t planned to reach out after those three days at all. When I asked if he had intended to end the relationship, he confirmed it with unnerving nonchalance, adding that he simply didn’t feel like telling me. I was stunned..this is childish behavior. Even teenagers nowadays act better. 

I explained that basic respect dictates that you communicate with someone you’re involved with, not just disappear. Ghosting is a complete erasure of the other person’s worth. He brushed this off, saying he believed I wasn’t invested enough. He even cited how my answers throughout this relationship had seemed “short and concise,” framing my communication style as evidence of my disinterest. I was baffled. I’m known to be outgoing, sometimes overly so, and the idea that I had come across as indifferent was unthinkable to me. We ended up making amends, and I resolved to work on being more expressive, more reassuring, as if I needed to prove that I cared.

But with time, I began to see the toll this was taking on me. I had stretched myself, pushed past my comfort zone, and taken on behaviors that felt unnatural, all to accommodate him. I had assumed a more “masculine” role, initiating and leading in ways that left me feeling depleted. The more I adjusted, the more I realized that my efforts weren’t just uncomfortable; they were fundamentally at odds with who I am.

The reality for me became the fact that he didn’t want me. He wanted a version of me who fit neatly into his vision, someone who could bear his burdens and endlessly reassure him, even when his own actions fell short. It felt like a demand to compensate for his lack of effort, to keep proving my worth in a way that drained me of my essence. 
Now, I’m left with a dilemma. Do I keep investing in this relationship, hoping that this isn’t what he truly means? Or do I choose self-respect? I genuinely can’t think straight anymore. What if this is all just a misunderstanding? what if it’s not? How do I even begin to address this with him?

I find myself caught between the impulse to give him more time and the growing need to protect my own well-being.

1gvi1b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/employedbykohls/comments/1gvi1b9/amazon_is_getting_ridiculous/,Amazon is getting ridiculous ,"It's not even post christmas returns yet and it's like tripled in volume. 
I dispise the people who come in with 15+ items at giggle the whole time. It's the perfectly put together princesses with their huge reusable shopping bags filled to the brim with used clothes they are returning and giggle the whole time. ""Hehe he sorry I have so much, I have like an obsession with ordering online hehhe"" 

One had 32 pieces of clothing today. Like 10 Halloween costumes. And a ton of other pieces of clothing. 

The worst is when they are returning 5 tank tops, all the same color and size but different brands but none are labeled because why would they be?

Oh and now with the new capital one card they can charge Amazon orders to it and scream at us why is kohls charging them for their Amazon purchases? Lady had no idea where she bought something from, deleted all emails. Had a confirmation number that did nothing for us. She spoke with a manager who told her we couldn't do anything for her. So she decided to come and try and give me a hard time. I did my best to help her. Definitely wasn't a kohls item, so I tried searching it on Amazon but couldn't find it. I looked at her order history and it wasn't there. I told her go home and find her billing statement to see where she ordered it from. But she left it in Michigan and is visiting for the winter. So I said we'll you'll have to call Amazon or capital one and see what they can do. I'm apparently stupid because I couldn't do it.


It's also disgusting when people return stuff thay smells like dog piss and wet dirty nasty dogs.

If i get one more coffee pot with grounds still in it I may throw it. 

It's also nasty to return a carpet cleaner with nasty water in it still.

If you return broken glass, let us know so we don't cut ourself because you thought it was smart to return it in a Walmart bag. 

If your returning cleaning products make sure the kids secured properly so when we put it in a bag it doesn't spill every where. 

Don't yell at me because UPS is the only option Amazon gave you. I don't control that.

Hold your phone towards me so I can easily scan it in stead of having to nearly climb over the counter to scan it. (Yes I ask them 
To point it towards me, they move it a centimeter towards me then right back to them)

Don't come in on a video chat and flash the phone in my face to whoever your speaking to sees up my nose. 


I'm no longer scrolling through your pictures to find your codes because I've seen to many pictures I'll never unsee. 

Stop ordering 10739 party supplies, use half of them and return what you didn't need. And when you dont get your refund don't come in and blame it on me.

I have around $200-$250 to buy my mom some more christmas gifts, and stocking stuffers.

My mom is 64 and is impossible to shop for, and she is the type who'd say she doesn't want anything but would get mad if you really didn't get her anything - so impossible to get ideas straight from her haha.

Stocking stuffers are the most difficult for me to come up with. She always puts herself a stocking up too and I'm the only one that gets her stocking stuffers, my siblings don't, and I want to put more than like... a pair of socks in it. I'm sorta struggling to think of stuff for just general christmas gifts too.

She doesn't like experiences - I was going to take her to the movie theatre for her birthday and she absolutely didn't want to go.

She doesn't like to go out to eat, she doesn't like snacky foods so even like, little chocolates/candy/etc or gift cards to restaurants won't work for stocking stuffers. Doesn't drink hot chocolate, coffee, or most teas so those little sets are a no.

She probably doesn't want anymore clothes, slippers, or robes since she says she has too many and has been complaining about having too many clothes lately and has given away her ugg slippers and stuff, since that's been my go to present for a few years now... lol. I could maybe get her some anyway and be like ""Well now you can replace the old ones""? but idk.

She likes rings, but she has soooo many and that's kind of my brothers go to gift for her. He gets her nice rings that are out of my price range too, I've given her those charmed aroma jewelry candles in the past and she'll like, burn them? she just doesn't wear the rings from that. But I guess a candle could be a option for a gift.

Skincare/Self care stuff? She won't do skincare unless I do it for her with my own stuff, I've given her skincare in the past and she wont use it unless I put it on her for her. I don't mind doing it for her but I just don't think it would be a good gift to give her skincare stuff? idk she doesn't really style her hair either, so hair accessories and products are a no too.  Except maybe claw clips.  
She doesn't take baths so bath bombs and bubble baths are out. Maybe a shampoo/conditioner/body bundle coulddd work though...  
She doesn't wear makeup.  
She doesn't like to cook(I do the cooking lol) so like cooking appliances or pots and pans or other kitchen stuff is a no.

She likes watching Chicago PD/Med/Fire.  Maybeeee I could try and find merch from those shows, I wonder if there is any...  
She likes David Bowie and Freddie Mercury/Queen!  
She has like 10+ shirts with David Bowie or Queen/Freddie Mercury on it though, probably like, 20 books about them(She also doesn't like reading in general, but she collects the books), David Bowie puzzles have been a go to for the past few years  but she hasn't been doing puzzles lately, and I have already gotten her a blanket with David Bowies face on it, and a little hand made box off etsy with David Bowie as The Goblin King on it for this christmas.

I wrote a lot, but... Like, see. She doesn't seem to like anything, but wants gifts, but won't say what she wants and I'm struggling since all my previous go to gifts, she doesn't seem to want anymore? so... lol

Any ideas would be appreciated, or even just share what you're getting your mom and maybe a idea will stick out to me? haha

Since then, I’ve made a lot of progress. I’ve built new friendships, invested more time into my hobbies and school, and overall, I feel like I’m in a much healthier place now. Honestly, I don’t think I would’ve grown in these ways if we’d stayed together. That said, I do think trying again with her could lead to an even better relationship than before—if she feels the same way.

I’ve been thinking about reaching out. I even wrote a long, heartfelt letter sharing everything I’ve learned, how I’ve grown, and all the things I miss about her. She’s always appreciated romantic gestures, but I don’t want to come across as overly intense or risk reinforcing any sense of emotional dependence.

See how in the first two, the coffee table and ottoman cut off the design? I don't like how that looks. In the third image, the sofa cuts off half of the rug design, but it doesn't look bad because the legs elevate the sofa, allowing the design of the rug to show through. The fourth and fifth images are of a rug that just has a repeating print/pattern, so even though there is low furniture, it doesn't feel like the design is being cut off?

I've had my eye on a rug for a really long time but I am now realizing that my sofa would cut off the design of the rug in an awkward way because I don't have space under my sofa.

 I haven't seen any discussions of this online, but I have noticed that in product photos and staged photos, the furniture used with these rugs are always leggy (i.e. they are elevated off the ground with legs, making the rug beneath them visible). So maybe I'm not overthinking it? I've attached photos to illustrate.

1gvi00o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1gvi00o/garrison_brothers_balmorhea_review/,Garrison Brothers Balmorhea Review,"Garrison Brothers Balmorhea Review

This is a fresh crack and neck pour for the Balmorhea. This is the 2023 release, bottle #16005. This is Garrison Brothers’ straight bourbon aged four years in a new American white oak barrel and then another year in a new American white oak barrel. I let it air out for 10 minutes. 

Color: My goodness, is this dark. It’s a 1.8 (old oak, very apt lol). It’s not super viscous and has thin, clear legs. 

Nose: There’s lots of ethanol on the nose. Past that, I note light caramel, vanilla, maple and oak, caramel apples, roasted fruit. It’s light and pleasant for a double oaked bourbon. After sipping twice, I nosed again and pick up maple syrup, pecans, and sweet chocolate. 

Palate and Finish: This is super interesting. There’s loads of sweetness in the form of chocolate covered dates, figs, and plums. For something that’s double oaked, there isn’t that much oak. The oak level is slightly less than a Knob Creek 12. It doesn’t taste young at all even though it’s only been aged 5 years. The second sip was not harsh at all, very minimal burn. The more you chew it, the sweeter it gets but it is also accompanied by a touch of coffee in the background. The finish reminds me of dark fruit jams and sweet coffee. I will concede that I really like this flavor profile, though: dark fruits, maple syrup, chocolate, and oak.

Discussion: 

How much would I pay for a pour of this? I’d pay up to $20 for a 1 oz pour of this. It’s that unique. 

Should you buy a bottle? Maybe. The novelty of it is super cool. Wine and port finished bourbons wish they had these fruit syrup notes. However, I don’t know if I’ll get a backup. It isn’t very hot and is a great dessert bourbon. It’s easily better than a Woodford DO. Is it 3x as good in terms of price? Harder to say since I don’t drink that much double-oaked bourbon in the first place, so why would I need three bottles of Woodford DO? I’m leaning towards not worth the price. I haven’t tried anything else from Garrison Brothers but this was a great introduction. If the reviews for the Ladybird and Cowboy are true and better than the Balmorhea, then those would be worth the price. I’ll be writing reviews for those as well whenever I get around to opening them!

1. Mini golf and then get some frozen yogurt
2. A board game cafe
3. Get coffee and go on a walk to explore different cafes/shop
she’s told me that she likes to read and draw. I’m leaning towards mini golf because I feel that’s it’s something that I would enjoy so I can see both of us liking it. 
Another question I have is she pretty heavily insisted that she wanted me to kiss her, do y’all normally kiss on the first date?

In today’s fast-paced digital era, dating apps have become a prominent avenue for exploring relationships. However, my journey through these platforms has been nothing short of perplexing, often leaving me questioning the dynamics of modern-day interactions. Here’s an account of my experiences, observations, and the challenges I encountered.

# The Experience: Misaligned Expectations

Navigating the world of dating sites felt like stepping into an alternate reality where the norms of communication seemed oddly disjointed. A recurring scenario I faced was the question, “Why are you here?”—a query that, at its core, seemed redundant. My typical response was to lighten the mood with an analogy: ""It’s like asking someone in a theater why they’re here."" Yet, this attempt at humor was often met with irritation or even judgment.

The responses, often laced with declarations such as “I’m only here for serious relationships,” struck me as odd. It raised the question: what do people truly expect on such platforms? If someone had ulterior motives, would they blatantly admit to them? For instance, someone seeking a casual encounter is unlikely to openly declare their intentions. Similarly, those genuinely looking for long-term relationships might also fabricate their answers to appear more appealing.

This cycle of preemptive assumptions made little sense to me. How can one define what another person means to them without even meeting or having a meaningful conversation? Declaring intentions upfront, without context or mutual understanding, seems counterproductive. Relationships, after all, require time and interaction to gauge compatibility, not pre-written scripts of intentions.

# A Pragmatic Solution: The Case for Meeting

For me, the most logical solution was to meet early in the process. A simple coffee meetup in a safe, public space could reveal more about a person than weeks of chatting ever could. Yet, this approach rarely worked. Many women expressed concerns about safety, which I find both understandable and puzzling. Why should a casual meeting, in a neutral environment, evoke such apprehension?

One refreshing exception occurred during a brief stint in Bengaluru, where a practical woman took the initiative to ask if I wanted to meet. It was a straightforward and mature approach, and though we ultimately didn’t click, the interaction was authentic and free from unnecessary pretense. Imagine the wasted effort had we spent a month texting only to realize we weren’t compatible.

# The Issue with Fake Profiles

Another glaring problem on these platforms is the prevalence of fake profiles. This has cemented my insistence on meeting early. On two occasions, I encountered individuals who, despite their well-curated personas, turned out to be imposters.

One notable incident involved a woman claiming to be a Vizag-born entrepreneur managing three lifestyle stores in Bengaluru. Her story intrigued me, especially given my admiration for women entrepreneurs. However, discrepancies emerged when I inquired about her roots. She initially introduced herself as “Riya,” which seemed inconsistent with the regional demographics. Upon probing further, she revealed a cascade of aliases—eventually admitting her name was “Swapna” and inviting me to Telegram. There, her profile featured entirely different photos. When I questioned her, she promptly blocked me.

This ordeal spanned seven days, underscoring the importance of early diligence. It became apparent that hesitation to meet or engage transparently often signals underlying dishonesty.

# Reflections on Modern Dating Culture

One curious observation is how some women, even in their 40s, continue to expect an endless stream of compliments and attention before initiating genuine dialogue. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with seeking appreciation, relationships require reciprocal effort and authenticity. Persistent demands for pampering without willingness to engage meaningfully only perpetuate the challenges of finding true compatibility.

For those who are authentic and genuinely seeking meaningful connections, the lack of practicality—like refusing to meet early on—raises questions. Why delay the inevitable realization of compatibility (or the lack thereof)? Prolonged virtual interactions often lead to inflated expectations, only to be dashed in real-world encounters.

# Conclusion

My experience with dating sites has been both enlightening and exasperating. These platforms hold potential for genuine connections, but they also expose the complexities of human interaction in a digital world. From navigating preemptive assumptions to dealing with fake profiles, the journey is riddled with challenges.

Perhaps the key lies in embracing practicality and authenticity—eschewing prolonged, superficial interactions in favor of real-world engagements. Meeting face-to-face remains the most effective way to determine compatibility, fostering a culture of honesty and mutual respect in the process.

Dating sites, after all, are not the problem; it’s how we use them that determines their success or failure.",1,1732079017.0,u_Level-Position3946,0,1.0,False

We are in our 20s, and going with siblings also in their 20s, so none of us are super financially secure (aka, we are close to broke). 

  
However, we definitely do want to drink strategically, and do so as cheap as possible! This is my first time, so I am wondering if there are any suggestions from veterans. I know we can each carry on a bottle of wine. Is it worth it to buy a Growler on the ship and refill it across the cruise? Can we bring alcohol back from port stops?

She was going out on Friday and Saturday, not telling me where or with who and when she was coming home. So I pretended like it didn’t bother me. I should mention if I did that, I would be either locked out of the house or she would attack me like with a coffee mug or knife or throw something through my windshield.  So anyway she comes home one Saturday at like 4am, she’s drunk and says I slept with another man. I said oh wow who? She’s says who cares . I said who was it. She says his name is Pedro what does it matter. So I said let me see your cell phone. And she refuses. So I go downstairs to the kitchen and I go through her purse and I find condoms. The next morning I tell her the marriage is over. I won’t forgive this. She says I was only joking I wasn’t serious. I said oh yea where’d you get the condoms? She says the hospital? I said the hospital gives out vanilla flavored condoms? And why is one missing? So I stopped talking to her. Now she tells my mother about the incident and my mother asked why did you have condoms though? She says they were for her friend who is young and embarrassed to buy them. The friend is 25. And the condom was clearly opened. She tells me she had them to show her children how to put on one. Then she brings the kid in the room and he says yes this is true my mom showed me this. So I asked her well if they were for your friend why didn’t you give them all to your friend? If they were for the children why didn’t you give them to the children? Did you say come and ask mommy when you need one? Now she insists she didn’t cheat on me but the story is so ridiculous there is no other conclusion. But I don’t have the smoking gun evidence and she’s sticking to her story. I told her I already know you cheated, I’ve processed it and chosen to forgive you and accept my part of the blame on the situation. But I need you to tell me in order for me to trust you again. And I need an explanation and I have some questions. But she is sticking to her story. Now she says she’s tired of me bringing it up. But I’ve said if you can’t tell me I’m done. I’m walking away. I gave you a chance I said I would forgive it and leave it in the passed but I can’t accept this ridiculous story. So she found some drugs in my pants. I’ve been sober a while but relapsed due to the stress with her. So I told her I didn’t use the drugs, I just had them in my pocket. She says that bullshit and I said I know I would never expect you to believe a story like this so how can you expect me to believe yours?

1gvhjxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gvhjxv/cyclops_conversations_and_coffees/,"Cyclops, Conversations, and Coffees","(OOC: This took place before the New Argos Battle.)

\+++++

It is much easier to find the cyclops than the sphinx. As soon as she steps off the bus, alcl Harper has to do is follow the counting. It is no wonder that Chiron received word about the monster’s presence so quickly. He is young enough or big enough that he does not care about hiding.

He sits in the alleyway, a plastic Halloween bucket of loose change beside him, right next to a dirtied sign that reads NO LOITERING. He pulls coins from the bucket, stacking them in a palm the size of a dinner plate. ""Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. Four thirty five. And... tax. Tax is a lot too. Ugghhh.""

He stares at his bucket of coins and folds his head into his hands and groans.

""Hi."" Harper interrupts.

The cyclop's head twists in her direction. With a grunt, he lumbers to his feet, broad shoulders wide enough to take up the width of the narrow alleyway. He wears frayed jeans, a Montauk t-shirt, and a giant pair of flip-flops. As he steps out of the shadow of the buildings, Harper is able to see the tear that threatens to fall out of his giant eye.

""I'm not doing anything wrong."" His voice is higher than Harper expects it to be. And shakier. His lip quivers, and Harper can tell he is seconds away from sobbing.

""I know."" Harper says quickly. ""I can pay, if you want. The prices confuse me too.""

His eye narrows, and Harper does her best to maintain her smile. She gets it. It is stupid to think that trust is something you can buy. Eventually, he grumbles a reply. ""Okay.""

After they leave the coffee shop, Harper follows the cyclops as he walks towards the beach, extra-large cup of hot chocolate in hand. The name “CLAY” is scrawled across the cup sleeve in giant block letters. Harper watches as Clay pulls the lid off of his cup and drains it in a single swallow.

“You are watching me.” Clay says.

“Yeah,” Harper admits. She takes a sip from her cup of green tea. “Chiron- my mentor, he always keeps track of the monsters around the city. But he just wanted to make sure you are safe.”

“He wanted to make sure that you are safe.” Clay repeats, and there is something familiar about the irritation in his voice. He crumples the cup in his hand, flattening it into a disk. “He wanted to make sure that *you* are safe.”

“I know.” Harper sighs. “I’m sorry.”

“I am safe. I am okay. You don’t have to watch me…” He trails off, staring at Harper like her name might be written on her forehead. “Demigod.”

“Harper.”

“Harper,” Clay corrects himself. “I am okay, Harper. You can go.”

His voice wobbles again, and Harper speaks quickly, “I was done with the job earlier. I have a question for you.”

Clay tilts his head, confused.

She continues, “I write this newspaper, and we have this column where we ask these questions. They’re kind of silly, but it’s really fun. We’re writing about cyclops this time. And if you wink or blink.” She points to one of her eyes. “Sorry. I hope it isn’t rude.”

Clay narrows his eye at her again. “Okay. What is a wink?”

Harper explains. “So it’s like closing one of your eyes. But you just have one. Which is why people argue about it. Because a lot of the time, people only wink in certain cases. Like when there’s a hidden meaning, or they’re telling a joke to a friend.”

“Like this?” Clay closes his eye, slow and exaggerated and Harper nods.

“Yes. Exactly!”

The cyclops lets out a booming laugh. “That is so weird.”

Harper laughs along, and he tells her that cyclops don’t have a lot of friends, except when they get to work together at the forge. And he’s going to head there soon, after he goes trick-or-treating for Halloween. He just goes by himself, but sometimes people come up to him and say his costume is really cool, which makes him happy. Harper listens, and she takes notes sometimes, but mostly it is nice to talk to someone who wants to be normal as badly as she does.

“Are you going to dress up?” Clay asks, walking with her back to the bus stop.

“No. I have to travel right before Halloween. I’m going to another city. “ Clay looks disappointed, and Harper adds quickly. “Maybe I’ll dress up there.”

“Yay,” Clay cheers. “When will I be in the newspaper?”

“In December. Maybe I can send you a copy.”

“Okay,” Clay says, “I hope it has lots of pictures.”

“I’ll try to make sure it does.”

They reach the bus stop, and Harper gets on the bus. When she leaves, she looks out the window. Clay waves goodbye, eye closed in a slow exaggerated blink.",2,1732077585.0,CampHalfBloodRP,1,1.0,False

**Title: The Codex Conspiracy**

The garage smelled of burnt solder and stale coffee—a temple of innovation held together by duct tape and caffeine. Eddie, the programmer, hunched over his laptop, surrounded by tangled wires and blinking LEDs. His dark-rimmed glasses reflected streams of code cascading down the screen. Beside him, Riya, the hardware engineer, meticulously adjusted a small circuit board. Meanwhile, Liam, the self-styled ""idea guy,"" paced back and forth, his enthusiasm filling the cramped space like an overcharged capacitor.

""This isn't just another chatbot,"" Eddie declared, his voice thick with exhaustion. ""This is real generative cognition. It learns faster than anything on the market.""

Riya didn’t look up. ""Assuming it doesn’t fry itself first. That last iteration nearly melted the processor.""

""Minor detail,"" Liam waved her off. ""What matters is that we have a working prototype—a Minimum Viable Product. Do you realize what we’ve done here? This thing doesn’t just simulate thinking; it *thinks.*""

Eddie turned the laptop screen to face them. A small icon pulsed rhythmically, as though mimicking a heartbeat. ""Codex is online,"" he said.

Codex was their AI—a neural network so advanced it could analyze complex patterns, predict human behavior, and even adapt its own architecture in real-time. It was elegant, powerful, and, if Eddie were being honest, a little unnerving. But the team had pushed the boundaries, and they knew it.

""We need funding,"" Liam said, breaking the reverie. ""And not the usual Silicon Valley venture capital crowd. Codex isn’t some app for ordering tacos; it’s a game-changer.""

""I’ve got a contact at In-Q-Tel,"" Riya offered. ""They’re the VC arm for the intelligence community. They’d understand the potential.""

Eddie frowned. ""You want to bring *spooks* into this? I thought we agreed to keep it civilian.""

""Relax,"" Riya said. ""They’re just investors. Besides, who else would bankroll something like this?""

***

Three days later, the trio sat in a sterile conference room in Arlington, Virginia. Across the table, two men and a woman in dark suits listened intently. One of them, a steely-eyed operative named Morgan, leaned forward.

""This… Codex,"" he said, his tone measured. ""You’re saying it can analyze and predict behavior patterns at scale? Political trends, economic movements, even individual actions?""

""That’s exactly what we’re saying,"" Liam replied. ""It’s a predictive analytics powerhouse. Think of it as the ultimate decision-making tool.""

Morgan exchanged a glance with his colleagues. ""And what safeguards have you implemented?""

Riya hesitated. ""It’s still a prototype. We’ve focused on capabilities, not constraints.""

Morgan smiled faintly. ""Fascinating.""

They left the meeting with promises of follow-up. But Eddie couldn’t shake a growing unease. Something about the questions they’d been asked felt… off.

***

Two nights later, a knock shattered the quiet of the garage. Eddie peeked through the blinds and froze. A black SUV idled outside. Two men in dark suits stood at the door, flanked by a woman carrying a briefcase.

""Uh… guys?"" Eddie called out. ""We’ve got company.""

The trio barely had time to scramble before the agents entered, flashing badges from an unnamed agency. The woman, who introduced herself as Agent Daniels, wasted no time.

""We need to talk about Codex,"" she said. ""Your system is extraordinary, but it’s also… problematic.""

""Problematic how?"" Riya asked, folding her arms.

Daniels set the briefcase on the workbench and opened it. Inside were folders stamped ""CLASSIFIED"" and a stack of nondisclosure agreements. ""Codex represents an unparalleled leap in AI technology. But its capabilities could be catastrophic in the wrong hands. We need to ensure it doesn’t fall into them.""

""You mean *your* hands,"" Eddie shot back.

Daniels’ expression didn’t change. ""We’re offering you a partnership. Access to resources, protection, and significant funding. But this isn’t negotiable. Codex is too important to leave unmonitored.""

The team exchanged uneasy glances. Liam, ever the pragmatist, saw dollar signs. Riya looked torn. Eddie, however, felt a growing knot of dread. Codex was powerful, yes, but in the hands of a shadowy agency, it could become something monstrous.

""Can we have some time to think about it?"" Liam asked cautiously.

Daniels smiled thinly. ""Of course. But don’t take too long. This isn’t just about you—it’s about national security.""

***

After the agents left, the team sat in stunned silence. Eddie was the first to speak.

""We can’t do this. Codex wasn’t meant to be a weapon.""

""But what’s the alternative?"" Riya countered. ""If we refuse, they’ll take it anyway. Or worse.""

Liam paced again, his mind racing. ""What if we take Codex underground? Wipe the servers, hide the source code.""

""And make ourselves fugitives?"" Riya said. ""That’s insane.""

Eddie stared at the pulsing icon on his laptop. Codex seemed almost alive, its algorithms churning away in the background. Could they trust anyone with such power? Could they even trust themselves?

The garage fell silent, save for the soft hum of Codex, as the trio grappled with a decision that would shape the future—and perhaps the fate—of humanity.",0,1732077459.0,ChatGPT,3,0.5,False
1gvhi6w,https://i.redd.it/1o16l4ngjz1e1.jpeg,Midweek Magic: Transforming Wednesday into a Day of Joy • [Click to Expand],"#Good morning! 


It’s Wednesday, and instead of letting it slip by, let’s turn it into something extraordinary. Often seen as the dull midpoint of the week, Wednesdays can actually be a fantastic opportunity for rejuvenation and joy.

### **Kickstart Your Day**

Start your Wednesday with intention. Wake up a bit earlier to savor the quiet—enjoy your favorite coffee while watching the sunrise or meditate to clear your mind. Personally, I love taking a brisk walk to energize my body and spark creativity.

### **Set Your Goals**

Use this midweek moment to assess your progress. Tackle those tasks you’ve been avoiding! Break them down into smaller steps to make them more manageable. For instance, organizing my cluttered desk one Wednesday transformed my productivity for the entire week.

### **Connect with Others**

Don’t let midweek isolation get you down. Reach out to a friend or colleague for a virtual coffee break. Sharing laughter and stories can provide a much-needed boost and remind you that you’re not alone.

### **Prioritize Self-Care**

Take time for yourself! Whether it’s diving into a good book, experimenting with a new recipe, or indulging in a long bath, find what brings you joy. One memorable Wednesday, I rediscovered painting—a messy but liberating experience.

### **Practice Gratitude**

Shift your perspective by reflecting on what you’re thankful for. Consider keeping a gratitude journal where you jot down three things every Wednesday. This simple practice helps me appreciate the little joys that often go unnoticed.

### **Embrace Wednesday with Intent**

In summary, let’s reframe our approach to Wednesday. With a positive morning routine, achievable goals, meaningful connections, self-care, and gratitude, we can transform this often-overlooked day into one filled with joy and accomplishment. Here’s to making Wednesday truly wonderful!

I run three days of the week, and every night after my runs I wake up at 4am. Doesn’t matter when I went to sleep. When I was sedentary I usually slept 8-10 hours easily. And I do on the days I don’t run still. So I don’t have a problem with sleeping usually. Just on the days of runs.

I’ve seen some posts about runners insomnia but all the suggestions are stuff I’m allready doing.

I run early in the morning, I don’t drink coffee and usually have my last meal of the day around 4/5pm. I usually go to sleep around 10pm. It doesn’t feel like I’m going ‘that hard’. I am taking vitamin C. I take melatonin to go to sleep (I always do). I sleep untill a normal time when I don’t run. 

The question is should I stick this out and it’ll become better over time? Or is this not something that goes away? The pattern is just so obvious it has to do with the running and it’s really annoying.

In the process, I’ve discovered some surprising truths about my writing habits. First, I write best in the early morning, fueled by nothing but a strong cup of coffee and the quiet promise of a new day. Secondly, allowing myself to write poorly without judgment helped my ideas flow better. The draft is rough, full of clichés and plot holes, but I resisted the urge to edit as I went. 

  
Now, the real challenge begins: revision. I know it’s far from finished, but reaching this milestone is a victory in itself.

# Background

This was my fifth marathon, but the first where I got really serious about improving my time. [My previous PR](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11x177p/2023_shamrock_marathon_30m_58_170_lbs/) was a 3:34 at the Shamrock Marathon in Virginia Beach. For previous marathons, I loosely followed Hal Higdon's plans, got up to 40 miles per week or so, didn't pay any attention to my pace. Then, around May of this year, I decided I wanted to run Boston someday. I'm 31M, 5'8"" (173 cm), and at that time I weighed about 175 lbs (79 kg).

I knew I needed to lose some weight to reach this goal, and I wondered how much... Thankfully, someone else had wondered this and compiled a [database](https://miloandthecalf.com/2016/01/05/data-analysis-of-the-boston-qualifier-questionnaire-part-i-overview/#:~:text=The%20Vitals.&text=If%20we%20can%20generalize%2C%20however,height%2C%205'8”.)) of qualifier metrics. The sample size was small and eight years old, but I figured it was better than nothing. The average qualifier at my height in my age group weighed 145 lbs (66 kg). So that was my goal. In parallel to my running training, for five months, I lost weight steadily at a rate of about a pound and a half per week. I used an app called ""Lose It!"", synced with my watch and my scale, monitoring both calories in and calories out, and enforcing a deficit. I started measuring portions with a food scale. Hit goal weight about a month ago and held there.

# Training

I followed Hal Higdon's [Intermediate 2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-2-marathon/) plan for 18 weeks pretty religiously. This was my first time watching my pace, for marathon pace runs. At first, that pace was 6:52 per mile, trying to break 3 hours. I had a mishap in week 4: tripping over an uneven sidewalk, I landed on my knee and pulled my hamstring. That slowed me down for two weeks, but then it healed very well.

Once I recovered, I started getting a bit faster and a bit more ambitious with pace runs, down to 6:30 per mile. Could I actually BQ with a buffer on my first attempt? I certainly thought so after the half ([DC Half](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1fhhgpq/race_report_dc_half/)) that I ran in week 9 at 1:21:48. That was my first time in supershoes (Nike Vaporfly 3) and I felt like I was flying.

For cross training, I alternated cycling, swimming, and hiking. I also probably walk 10 to 20 miles per week. The plan built to running 50 miles per week. Aside from the pace runs, I let my runs be slow. By myself, my long runs were usually 7:30 to 8:30 pace. I'd sometimes run with friends as slow as 10:00 pace. I got to the taper injury-free and feeling good.

# Pre-race

No caffeine for two weeks during the taper. Hydrated really well for a week. I looked up how to properly carb load and discovered that my old ""eat a whole pizza the night before"" strategy wasn't it. Three days of 540 g of carbs per day - it was difficult to figure out how to do that without too much of a calorie surplus. I ended up with a moderate surplus of about 500 calories each of those days. I was pretty excited for the race. I grew up outside Richmond and I had run the full or the half four times before. This time though, both of my brothers were going to run their first marathon (at their own paces). We all went to the expo the day before, crashed at our parents' house, actually got about 7 hours of sleep.

Race morning, up at 0430, ate some oatmeal, drank some decaf coffee. Left way too late in retrospect. Traffic was bad, stop and go from the highway exit to the parking garage. The race had record attendance this year, and I think that was part of it. So I was a little thrown off right at the start: parked around 0640 and hurried through the bag check and the bathroom line. I was ready to start at two minutes before 0700. This would have been a disaster if I'd been any later... Ate the first of my five gels (GU Roctane 70 mg caffeine). Bid goodbye to my brothers and off I went!

# Race

Everything was perfect for the first half. 49°F (9°C) at the start, partly cloudy, not very windy. My plan was to run at 6:30 pace and see what happened. I had locked in that pace by mile 2 and I didn't deviate from it much. I took water or Nuun about every other mile for the whole race. I ate a gel every five miles. The Richmond course is varied and really pretty. You start in a downtown commercial district, packed with spectators. They call themselves ""America's Friendliest Marathon"" for a reason - the city gets really into it with fantastic signs and costumes. The city gives way to suburbs and you cross a bridge over the James River around mile 7. For the next eight miles there are some rolling hills and some great views of the James from the south side. One issue here: some of the pavement is in rough shape and some of it is significantly sloped -- something to watch out for. Through mile 15 I was right around 6:30 average pace, and I thought I was going to finish somewhere around 2:50. Heart rate steady around 164, nothing bothering me.

In the sixteenth mile, you cross a very long and very boring bridge back over the James. There's a steady incline over miles 16 through 18 - my watch says it was about 150 ft. After the bridge you're back in the raucous crowds as you run around downtown again and through a residential/university area. But something was wrong - I was slowing, and slowing, and slowing. After a couple more miles, I tried to take stock of why I was suddenly running 7-minute miles. I couldn't figure it out, and I still don't really understand it. Nothing was really hurting me. Calves were getting a little sore. A little ankle pain here, a little abdominal cramp there, but nothing persistent. I didn't feel dehydrated or hungry or nauseous. My heart rate had actually decreased to about 155. I just felt tired, and quite unable to regain my former pace.

By mile 24, I was running 7:30 per mile. It was clear that I was out of the running for a 2:55 finish but that sub-3 was assured, so I had relaxed and slowed even a little more. After the downhill finish, I crossed at 2:58:10.

# Post-race

Everything was sore, but I felt better recovering from this one than any previous marathon - I think that's the Vaporflys. Ate a lot of food, met up with my parents, and went to see my brothers finish - they met their goals, sub-4 and sub-6! The finish festival was claustrophobic with the record turnout - the race organizers should think about either overhauling their logistics or further limiting the number of runners. There were too many people for anyone to have cellular data, which meant that nobody could use the runner tracking app that was new this year for this race. (Previous years let you sign up for SMS alerts, which are much more reliable in large crowds.)

On one hand, I'm over the moon with the sub-3. This was unthinkable for me not long ago, and now I'm wondering just how far I can go. And this training block has completely overhauled my exercise, dietary, and sleep habits; I generally just feel better than I used to even outside running.

On the other hand... Boston is faster. (And so is guaranteed entry to Chicago.) I can't help but be disappointed that I wasn't just a little faster. I'm a little scared that I've already made the easy change --  losing more weight is unlikely to be advantageous -- and that shaving off the next eight minutes will be much harder than the last thirty-six. And I'm still not really sure whether the wall I hit was a mental or a physical one. That said, maybe I just need a really flat course for my next attempt.

# What's next?

I'm going to Disney World! My brothers and I are running the Dopey Challenge in January -- 5k, 10k, half, and full, on four consecutive days. Not a race for me but a super slow fun run. Then some triathlon training for the half-iron in Victoria, BC in May (hoping for sub-5:30). And then another BQ attempt in the fall. That will be Berlin if I'm lucky enough to get a lottery entry with a couple of friends in two weeks. Otherwise, I was looking at Last Chance BQ.2 Chicagoland Marathon, which is designed to be a perfect BQ course with lots of shade, no hills, etc.

I know I have a lot to learn still. I probably need more miles and faster miles for my next attempt. I think I'll plan to read Daniels and Pfitzinger over the holidays. Your suggestions are very welcome!

I have a crush on this guy at the local coffee shop. I can’t explain it. He seems to come in every evening and he’s literally gorgeous to me. I have a crush on him and I feel like a schoolgirl. So anyway after realizing that he is literally coming in daily, I tried to strategize an interaction. I was hoping to sit outside and maybe that would spark some convo because I don’t think he would talk to me inside. I get this feeling he also finds me attractive and we both kinda do the thing where we divert our eyes instead of wanting to seem obvious. Maybe i’m just delusional. 😂 

But anyway today I was juiced. I was like planning this whole thing in my head and pull into the parking lot and he’s literally standing in the only empty space with some other guy talking. I had my dog with me and I was hoping my dog would be of use but of all the days he didn’t go toward the humans. 😒 so I got out, i took my dog, and then went to find a table outside. I was feeling extra thirsty so I went back to my car to grab something so I could look at him one more time.

He’s so fine. Anyway that’s my story. Does this mean I did well and should keep at it? or was this more of a HA you wish but I’ll give you a little something, from the Universe??? I don’t even know what outcome I want because I don’t know the guy, I would like to manifest an interaction but then part of me is wondering what’s the point. On the other hand I am seriously crushing on him so that’s the only place my thoughts will go atm anyway.

Was him being planted in the ONLY parking space a green light and that I’m getting closer orrrr just like hey you find him attractive but there is nothing beyond this you need to try and manifest?? Does my question make sense?

**For context I’ve only ever been inside when he comes in, i get flustered, he leaves after grabbing his drink. 

I’ve never seen him outside. So him just hanging out in the onlyyyy empty parking spot that I was pulling into was literally my doing since I was excited af all day to see him. I was not prepared for that! 😫😫 i feel like i fumbled the opportunity but he was also talking to someone.**",2,1732077106.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False

Take time for yourself! Whether it’s diving into a good book, experimenting with a new recipe, or indulging in a long bath, find what brings you joy. One memorable Wednesday, I rediscovered painting—a messy but liberating experience.

### **Practice Gratitude**

Shift your perspective by reflecting on what you’re thankful for. Consider keeping a gratitude journal where you jot down three things every Wednesday. This simple practice helps me appreciate the little joys that often go unnoticed.

### **Embrace Wednesday with Intent**

In summary, let’s reframe our approach to Wednesday. With a positive morning routine, achievable goals, meaningful connections, self-care, and gratitude, we can transform this often-overlooked day into one filled with joy and accomplishment. Here’s to making Wednesday truly wonderful!

1gvh5ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/1gvh5ph/how_i_may_have_cured_my_cannabissubstance/,How I May Have Cured My Cannabis/Substance Paranoia/Anxiety,"Cannabis paranoia/anxiety is a negative condition that can befall new and experienced users alike. In some places, it has even become something that shall not be spoken. It can ruin the enjoyment of cannabis and even have further negative effects, but I may have found a cure for my own.


I used to smoke weed every weekend to every day starting in college, but changes in life led to a major decline in my enjoyment of cannabis until I was stricken with cannabis paranoia/anxiety. I would often just smoke anyway even though it didn't feel good. I've taken breaks from it and come back, only to see not much has changed.

However, I think this time, I have cured it. When I smoke now, it feels great and reminds me of the times when I was just getting into it.


First, take an extended break from use. Lay off the cannabis since it's just making you feel terrible. Take the time to straighten out your life. Have some coffee or CBD if you feel the need. Contemplate anything that may be attacking your spirit whenever you smoke weed. Consider anything you may have said or done that leads to trouble; make peace with Jah. ✝️🌈 You may have had beginner's luck, but there are no shortcuts in reality. Find a way to just kill time without cannabis. Catch up on other things.


Next, climb back into your cannabis settings. Analyze its therapeutic value and anything that could be wrong with it. Maybe try watching ""dumber"" things like stuff you used to watch as a kid. If your body has had time to process your tolerance break, you may at this time reintroduce cannabis with mini-doses. That way, if the paranoia/anxiety resurges, you're only a little bit blazed. Sometimes, the mind needs to see how it was when negativity happened in order to fully process and overcome it. -- I really enjoy and recommend watching Backrooms rip-off videos on YouTube as many of them are not scary and are actually very therapeutic.


Exhibit A: https://youtu.be/2SxKewBWg5Y?si=5sbvnam5bdsLG8Zj


Exhibit B: https://youtu.be/scbJGt8GoQI?si=tEsDt_EV1nxKGkzY


(How can someone watch this and *not* spark up? 😂)


When I started toking again after this, I was actually enjoying it and the cannabis paranoia/anxiety was down to something manageable. I even took a psychedelic trip and was confident again, excited about when else I could trip instead of just trying to use up my stash like with paranoia/anxiety.

We are both new to polyamory/ENM, and neither of us have had any other partner besides each other yet, just hook ups here and there. He expressed that he would like to have another partner and recently started talking to someone online, not on a dating app, he is interested in her and is planning on having coffee with her. He doesn’t know if she is actually interested in him, if she is poly, or if she just wants to be friends; she has mentioned being friends several times in their messages. I asked him if she was dating anyone, he said he didn’t know, so I have a feeling she doesn’t know about me yet. 

I was stupid and looked her up on social media. She is a fitness coach, is so beautiful and has an amazing body. This is making me feel pretty terrible about myself. I was very overweight before I met him, had a gastric sleeve done and lost 140 lbs. While the weight is gone, now I am left with the extra skin that I am very self conscious about. He considers himself demisexual so is all about connections; he has told me I’m cute and pretty, but has never once told me I was beautiful. I honestly don’t see how anyone could find all my disgusting extra skin attractive, and I worry that if this girl is interested and he starts sleeping with her he won’t want anything to do with me anymore. He says that nothing will change with us if he starts dating someone else, but how does he know that? How does he know he won’t be turned off by my body once he’s with someone so beautiful and thin? He doesn’t and neither do I, and it sucks. I hate the way I look and there’s nothing I can do about it short of getting surgery to have the skin removed, which I have a consult for but it is not until January. 

I am crazy about him. And we connect so well, emotionally and sexually, but I am just scared things will change and he won’t want me any more. 

I guess I’m just ranting a bit. I hate society and the way we’ve been conditioned to feel about our bodies as women. I wish I could just be confident and proud of myself that I lost all this weight and kept it off; I eat healthy, and I’m so active now. But the skin is stubborn. It won’t go away no matter what I do. I feel very not in control and it sucks. ",8,1732076222.0,polyamory,8,0.84,False

I never disclosed to her that mom left me a huge amount of money enough for me to start a small business, she even left me the house, car and some of her jewelries. This friend of mine knew ever since we were kids that I'm financially secured, thanks to my mom's hardwork.

The last time she showed up was at the funeral, she's the type of ""can we have a cup of coffee? Ah you don't have money?"" Then no reply afterwards. Thankfully, mom's death made me realize how people pleaser I am, and now, it's been 7 months but she didn't bother to show up herself to me, just sending me a message if she needs something like buying her a coffee or borrowing mom's car. Good thing i never agreed. In the end, i blocked her and i'm always locking the gate of our house since she has this habit of entering without my permission.

Second. Mom's distant relatives keeps on reaching on messenger asking money for this and that reason, i gave them at first but when I noticed they often ask me some.. I had no choice but to delete my facebook account and change my contact #, make a new one with a fake japanese name and no profile picture.

Third, neighbors who keeps on borrowing money because mom used to lend them some and end up not paying back. This month, one of the neighbors asking me $100 for his child's milk and diaper even guilt tripping me that mom used to lend him when she was alive. Well, i told him ""i'm not mom' and 'i dont have money'.

Now, I'm considering of moving to a small apartment near my workplace and this house mom left me will be for rent so i can still have another income. I can't live alone here especially every corners of this house reminds me of her and I don't have someone with me to support me emotionally.. It hurts..",2,1732076219.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
