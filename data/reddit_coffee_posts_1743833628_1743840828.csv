So i'm a 31 year old woman who have been dealing with OB for years, sometimes going through intense phases for weeks. I've done countless tests, taken countless treatments...   
  
I was going through a horrible intense phase last week when i decided i couldn't live like this anymore. Having to go every 5 minutes, keeping me awake all night, you know the drill.  
  
What worked :   
1) I switched to decaf coffee, only caffeinated in the morning or punctually   
  
2) I realized i was squeezing my muscles too hard to pee, so I switched to letting it slowly and gently flow out instead of forcing it out.  
  
3) and most important -- doctors all told me this but only when i really forced myself to, did it actually work -- HOLDING IT IN. It was SO hard at first, i was uncomfortable all day, all night. But i started to go only when I knew i had a full bladder.. and no kidding after only 4 days, my symptoms stopped ! And now I only feel the urge to go when my bladder is full ! But it's tough, especially when i had to leave the house. I usually need to pee at least 5 times before going out and then I will still get the urge after 5 minutes. Not anymore hehehe!!!!! Hold it in as long as you can, even before sleeping.   
  
4) Drinking 1,5L of water per day, to fill up the bladder and re-educate it to signal the urge to pee only when it's full, and also to keep hydrated !

I absolutely had to share!! stay safe ",1,1743840625.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

I worked my BUTT off making sure we got ahead today, doing the trash run my self, making sure to catch up on dishes/doing certain things early.  Scrubbing the floors while doing my pulls, my donations, my tills etc. we seemed at a really good place and I finished my money stuff at the end of the night and still had 20-30 minutes so I went to count our delivery and reorganize the fridge for our openers. My baristas were finishing up the last little things (both seasoned workers etc) one of them clocked off before talking to me while the other was checking in, since the other one was checking in with me i told them to double check for towels and anything out of place. (I’m not gonna make anyone stay so I can do extra stuff if our normal stuff is finished cause that feels unfair to me) and I went to do my double check, while I was double checking the other barista clocked out. The counters were dirty and ovens were left on, I honestly was kinda frustrated because I know they know better then to leave a mess and went to talk to them saying something along the lines of “I know we want to get out early but we can’t just clock out and leave without making sure everything is done. The ovens are still on and the counters have crumbs and coffee stains all over.” I went to turn off the ovens when the barista who had clocked off without checking in or saying anything just left the store. The barista who was checking in stayed and let me know the other one had said “maybe (me) should do their job instead of the openers job” and honestly that made me really upset. I had spent the entire day running around doing as much as I could myself so that they didn’t have to feel stressed and could have a quick and easy close. I know I should’ve double checked before I did my extra stuff but at the same time they were actively finishing up when I did my side project. I just thought I’d ask here because we all work for the siren and some of you might have opinions that could help me do better and understand better. ",1,1743840451.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I’m a late-30s woman and an entrepreneur who deeply values kindness, quiet depth, and the kind of conversations that make you feel truly seen. As an introvert, finding those genuine connections in adulthood has been surprisingly rare. I miss the kind of friendships where you can talk about dreams, random thoughts, comfort songs, or just the little things that made you smile today.

A little more about me: I’m a dog lover who finds peace in quiet corners—like libraries, cafés, or walking alone in the rain with a cup of hot coffee in hand. I love the calm of purple hues, the warmth of slow mornings, and the cozy stillness after a storm. I’m not big on small talk, but once I feel comfortable, I open up easily.

I’ve had more than a few “I told you so” moments that make me wonder if my intuition borders on the psychic—call it gut feeling or just deeply observant.

I’d really love to connect with someone kind, emotionally grounded, and open to thoughtful, meaningful exchanges. Doesn’t have to be constant—just real.

If you’re someone who likes to move through life a little slower and with more intention, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me your favorite comfort food, something that gives you a strange sense of peace, or what you wish people understood about you.

I’d love to chat here if this resonates with you :)",2,1743840385.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1jrygp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThoughtsYouCanFeel/comments/1jrygp8/peak_of_humanity/,Peak of Humanity,"Tomorrow I am going to experience the peak of humanity. Tomorrow, it will be Saturday, April 5, 2025 - not a special or meaningful day, per say, but one which I will try to appreciate for what it is. I will likely wake up around the time that the sun rises, with the music of my choosing playing at a pleasant volume from my speaker / alarm clock / radio (the radio function of which hasn’t been used in over ten years), and I will be warm and clean. I will most likely lie in my bed, partially awake for the duration of 4-5 songs, as I will have nowhere to be. There will be noise outside of my apartment window from the street which won’t bother me. Generally speaking, I am among the most content people I have ever met.

	Then I will have some choices: do I want to work out in my building’s gym, then take a shower, then make breakfast / brunch for myself; or should I take my retro road-bike that I bought from a bike collector on craigslist and have made a significant part of my personality (for aesthetic reasons, mostly) to a coffee shop that I haven’t tried yet in this new city that I really only just moved to and am still exploring. I will probably decide to combine the two and push back my schedule because for some strange reason I take a small amount of pride in getting to coffee shops before the regular midday crowd. Tomorrow, these decisions will do more to stress me out than they will to remind me to experience this long-awaited pinnacle of human society.

	The economy is probably crashing but it’s the weekend so my country graciously turns the stock market off. Also I’m 25, making 125k, with friends, family, and extensive safety nets below me so it’s not like I wouldn’t be fine anyways. There won’t be many people - anywhere in the world most likely - who can appreciate tomorrow with the peace and clarity that I could be able to. Really makes you think… not too hard, there’s only so much to think about.

	Tomorrow is not the peak for any particular reason - I don’t think anything particularly amazing is going to happen - it simply \~will be\~. When you tally up all the human suffering, all the rights, freedoms, and liberties of all the people all over the world, look at all the art being created and shared, all the connections being made, and conversations being had, everything just adds up to tomorrow being the “best” it ever has been, and apparently, the “best” it ever will be. Obviously a lot of things are still terrible all over the place, but that’s the thing about *things* \- they always have been terrible and always will be terrible for a lot of people all over the place. Not for me though – my life is really good. “*Must be nice…*”

	I am really going to try to take everything in, in ways that I typically don’t. I want to listen to people talk and laugh; I want to go to the water and look at the eight hundred-thousand ton bridge above me that a thousand people my age built a hundred years ago. I want to talk to my girlfriend who is three thousand miles away and really think about how my voice is vibrating little plates in my phone which turns into frequencies that get sent into the literal air all around me to be picked up instantaneously by a cell tower a mile away which routes those frequencies across the country before turning them into light and shooting them through a tube only for the process to then be reversed and for her to instantaneously mishear whatever meaningless thing I was reporting in the first place. Don’t fact check me on the process but whatever’s actually happening is incredibly insane. I also want to really think about dinosaurs. That’s also insane, they were literally right here.

	Maybe tomorrow sucks, idk, doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. There are so many problems, that’s not the point. But somebody’s blasting “A Thousand Miles” by Vanessa Carlton outside right now and that’s pretty cool. I’m gonna go to sleep and hopefully all will go to plan…

1jrye4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1jrye4t/my_canadian_bc_botox_journey/,My Canadian (BC) Botox Journey,"I wanted to share my botox journey and timeline as a 32 year old Canadian living in BC. It took 9 months from speaking to a doctor to the surgery, but I half of that time was because I wanted to delay the surgery. It could have taken 5 months instead. Total out of pocket cost was $0 because I am in Canada. A short TLDR summary is below.

# Journey

I had known about this condition for a while and casually followed this sub so I was aware about the botox procedure. I started considering doing the procedure, however, I was originally living in Alberta and at that time there were no doctors that would do this treatment. At that time, I believe Dr. Hu in Vancouver was the only one.

I moved to Vancouver at the end of 2023 and I was excited to consider the botox procedure. However, my reserach found that people have had mixed experiences with Dr. Hu and long waits of over a year for extra testing. This made me lose interest and I had put it off for a while.

Sometime in 2024, I stumbled on a thread here where someone had mentioned Dr. Zhao in Kamloops also did this procedure and had a short wait! I was willing to do the 3-4 hour drive from Vancouver to Kamloops to meet with him, but to see a specialist in Canada, I needed a referral from a family doctor first. This was difficult because most major cities in Canada are struggling with doctor shortages and since I was a new resident in Vancouver, it was hard to find a family doctor accepting new patients. I could have gone to a walk-in, but I thought of something else.

**July 2024:** The easier solution I had thought of is to use an online service called rocketdoctor, which connects you with a physician that you talk to through a video call. I was connected to a doctor who (to no surprise) had not heard about R-CPD. After explaining the condition and symptoms to her, she wanted me to do testing for h. Pylori before she was willing to give me a referral because she says some of the symptoms I listed matched with some of the symptoms for a h. pylori infection. I scheduled an appointment at a lab to do this test and got the results back within a few days. I then scheduled a follow up appointment through rocketdoctor and the doctor sent the referral to Dr Zhao. The time for all this took about a month, from beginning to the end of July.

**September 2024:** It took a while for Dr Zhaos office to contact me but they eventually did at the beginning of September. I scheduled an appointment for mid September and made the drive from Vancouver to Kamloops. Dr Zhao was great and patient. We talked about what I knew about the condition and he explained the Botox procedure, making sure to answer any questions I had. He noted that there are no official tests that can be done to diagnose this and it's only diagnosed by the patient's description of symptoms. That was great to hear because he did not require lengthy tests that I have read about with other doctors. He mentioned that he has only done the treatment a few times because it was rare for someone to be aware of this condition and also seek treatment. At the end, I agreed to proceed with the Botox which would be done under general anesthesia.

**October 2024:** about 2-3 weeks later I got a call to schedule the surgery within the next few weeks, however I did not want to make the drive to Kamloops in the winter time so I pushed it out to March.

**March 2025, day of surgery:** I drove to Kamloops with my wife the day before and I arrived at the hospital at 6 am the next day. I checked in and went to the day surgery area. I changed into a hospital gown, got asked a bunch of questions, and had the IV prepared. The check in, prep, and wait time before the surgery lasted about 2-3 hours. Everything moved pretty quickly and the staff were quite attentive. This is different from my other experiences with hospitals which constantly seem under staffed and you have to wait forever for anything to get done. Right before the surgery, Dr Zhao came to say hi and asked me if I had any questions.

I was eventually moved to the surgery room and I was surprised by the number of people there! I think there were 6 or 7 people total in the room (anesthesiologist, nurses, assistants, Dr Zhao). I understand that it is a surgery but I guess I was caught off guard because Dr Zhao had explained that it's a very simple procedure!

I was put to sleep and when I woke up, I was told everything went great! Dr. Zhao went with 100 units. The surgery lasted only about half an hour. I had  a sore throat, constant feeling of a lump in my throat, and a cough after waking up. The nurse gave me Tylenol, ice water, and a popsicle. I was discharged with a prescription for pain killers and pantoprazole (for acid reflux) about an hour later and had my wife pick me up. I was in the hospital from 6am - 10am and we went back to the hotel. I had to stay in Kamloops for the night.

Lunch was not difficult, I had some udon noodles which went down easily. I had to be careful with the heat, but I didn't experience any slow swallow yet. At the end of the day, I drank a bit of soda. A few minutes later I leaned back on to my side and I burped! I could actually taste the soda. It was very exciting.

**Post surgery day 1:** The sore throat became a bit worse and the slow swallow started. I had to sip water with every bite but I was still able to eat a hamburger. The burps were coming after every few bites and sips. I could feel the gas building up and if I relaxed, I was able to release the gas. The coughs stopped at this point.

**Post surgery day 2:** The sore throat was getting pretty bad. I was taking the pain killers and cough drops. It hurt the most when swallowing. I looked into my throat and actually noticed my uvula looked weird, it had a white tip at the bottom. After some research it seems like I had uvula necrosis (damaged uvula) from the surgery and maybe that's why my throat was hurting so much. My lovely wife made me congee which was easier to swallow. The burping was going great. If I felt some pressure build up I would try to relax and it would come out through a quiet, long burp.

**Post surgery day 3:** in the morning I drank some water, but made the mistake of swallowing while bending down to fill my dog's water bowl. It was scary because the water got stuck and I was choking on it. This gave me a coughing fit but it was eventually okay. Sore throat still the same and hadn't gotten any better.

**Post surgery day 4 and 5:** These days were definitely the worst for throat pain. I was difficult to eat or drink anything. Having softer foods didn't really help because it felt like the pain came from the movement of swallowing. On day 5, my uvula looked back to normal though.

**Post surgery day 6:** The pain suddenly was so much better this day. I still had slow swallow but I could eat so much faster because it did not hurt to swallow every bite. The burps continue to come. However, today the burps tasted pretty bad, almost like I just vomited. I wonder if this was due to acid reflux.

**Post surgery day 7+:** Everything felt great! Still burping. Only thing is a bit of a slow swallow, but not as slow as before. I am finishing meals before my wife again haha. There is no pain at all and the feeling of the lump in my throat is gone.

# Summary

**July 2024:** Scheduled an appointment through Rocketdoctor to get a refferal to see Dr. Zhao in Kamloops. She wanted me to do some lab testing first but then sent out the referral after that was done.

**September 2024:** Met with Dr. Zhao and he was willing to schedule the botox surgery right away.

**October 2024:** Got a call to schedule the surgery. Was able to schedule the surgery within the next few weeks but I wanted to wait until March.

**March 2025, day of surgery:** Surgey was performed under general anesthesia and I was in the hospital for about 4 hours. Woke up with a sore throat, feeling of a lump in the throat, and a cough.

**Post surgery day 1:** Sore throat became worse and the slow swallow started kicking in, but I started burping. No more coughing.

**Post surgery day 2:** Swallowing started becoming difficult with the sore throat.

**Post surgery day 3-5:** Most painful days for the sore throat. Very difficult to swallow anything due to the pain, even liquid.

**Post surgery day 6:** Pain got so much better! Still have slow swallow but much better than before. Still burping!

**Post surgery day 7+:** Pain completely gone, lump completely gone. Still burping!

# Final thoughts

I am so glad that I got this done and it was so worth it for the few days of pain. I am typing this as I am sipping on a coffee which had always been one of my triggers for causing bloat. This is making me think back to a time a number of years ago.

I was waiting for my friends so that we could go and play sports. While waiting, I had a coffee and a snack. This was before I was  knowledgeable about this being a condition. I thought my body just couldn't burp, but I did not know that other people didn't experience all the discomfort of bloat. The coffee was a huge mistake because I just felt horrible the whole time. I felt like I had to puke during all the games and I thought something was wrong with me. After playing, I went to the washroom and tried to puke, which I just air vomitted and made me feel so much better. I am so happy to think that I never have to be in that kind of situation again (assuming I can retain the ability to burp....).

Hope this detailed journal was useful to whoever is feeling anxious about getting the botox! Like everyone says, it is such a life changer!",1,1743839632.0,noburp,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Primeira Liga, where the stakes are high, the goals are low, and the drama is somewhere in between. This Saturday, we have a tantalizing matchup between Vitória SC and Santa Clara, two teams vying for that elusive fifth-place finish like it's the last slice of pizza at a party.

Vitória SC, with their impressive home record, are the favorites here. They've been as solid as a rock at home, losing only once since September. Their odds of 1.91 on FanDuel suggest that the bookmakers are as confident in their home prowess as a cat is in its ability to knock things off a table.

Santa Clara, on the other hand, are the underdogs with odds hovering around 4.3 on BetRivers. They're like that friend who insists they're not interested in European competitions but secretly hopes to get invited to the party anyway. With key players Pedro Pacheco and Wendel Silva out, Santa Clara will need to channel their inner Rocky Balboa to pull off an upset.

Both teams have shown defensive resilience recently, which is a polite way of saying they sometimes forget how to score. The predicted 1-0 victory for Vitória SC seems about right, given their home advantage and Santa Clara's travel woes.

For the best bet, I'd recommend taking Vitória SC to win at 1.91 on FanDuel. If you're feeling adventurous, the under 2.0 goals at 1.8 on BetMGM could also be worth a punt, considering both teams' recent scoring struggles.

So, grab your popcorn, or perhaps a strong cup of coffee, and get ready for a match that promises to be as thrilling as a game of chess played by two very cautious grandmasters.

1jrybon,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/1jrybon/trump_supporters_responses_to_the_potential/,Trump supporters’ responses to the potential impacts of tariffs are devoid of critical thought and contradictory,"
There is absolutely no denying that consumers will pay the price of Trump’s tariffs. From the Twitter discourse I’ve seen, MAGAs response to the majority’s criticism is to (1) “buy American” and (2) “stop being materialistic”. If there are other takes from MAGAs I’m down to hear but as far as I know there is just no way to flip Trump’s tariffs as a good thing. 

(1) “Buy American”: there is just no way people are saying this. It is commonly known that the majority of our consumer goods are a product of imports. Relying on domestic production would not meet the amount of demand people have for goods. A good like coffee grounds has a demand that greatly exceeds what regions such as Hawaii/Puerto Rico can supply. This is why we trade with other countries. It’s a system that has worked for the US given geographical implications and the magnitude to which the US has developed. So is his plan to reshore production? This would be very costly. There is no critical thinking behind this statement.

(2) “stop being so materialistic”: I don’t have much to say to this other than that I am baffled that this is a response coming from a group of people that claim to care about economic growth/stimulation. Of course, there is room for social commentary on Western materialism, but that is a whole other conversation. High consumer spending (which is driven by materialism) fuels a high-performing economy. The sudden contempt for materialism is such a hypocritical and contradictory take for a group of people that centered the entire election around the prices of things going up.

- **The Aha Moment**: After one particularly crazy week of missing deadlines and feeling like I’d achieved absolutely nothing (despite being “busy”), I hit rock bottom. I needed order. Enter time blocking.

- **The Magic Sauce**: Every Sunday night, I now carve out 30 minutes to block out my week. It’s like meal prepping, but for your brain! 🍲

    * **Prioritize Your Rocks**: Start with the non-negotiables — those big, chunky tasks that are most important. Make sure they get prime real estate on your calendar. 

    * **Batch Tasks**: Group similar tasks together. Hopping between different types of activities is like switching TV channels — inefficient!

    * **Incorporate Flex Time**: Because let’s face it, life happens. And you need space to deal with the “Where’s the report?” or “Can you jump on a call?” curveballs. 🚀

    * **Me Time**: Block out time for yourself daily. It’s not selfish, it’s essential. Whether it’s reading, walking, or just staring off into space contemplating the universe. 🌌

Lo and behold, with time blocking, I found hidden hours in my week. Time I could spend learning something new, catching up with friends, or, you know, actually relaxing. Who knew that could be a thing, right?

Now, I’m not saying throw away spontaneity entirely (I’m still up for spontaneous cake runs 🍰), but having a framework can give you the freedom to enjoy those sweet, unplanned moments when they do arise.

Ever tried time blocking? How did it work for you? Or if you’ve got your chaos under control in another cool way, drop your wisdom! Keep maximizing, folks! 😎✨",1,1743839118.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the age-old tale of Celta Vigo visiting Son Moix, a place where their hopes and dreams have gone to die for over two decades. It's like the Bermuda Triangle of La Liga for them. Celta Vigo hasn't won at this stadium since 2003, which was so long ago that Nokia was still the king of mobile phones, and people were still trying to figure out what a ""Facebook"" was.

Both teams are tied in the table, and while Celta Vigo has a slight edge in goal difference, their away form is about as reliable as a politician's promise. Mallorca, on the other hand, has a coach known for his tactical prowess, which is a fancy way of saying he knows how to park the bus when needed.

The odds are as tight as a hipster's skinny jeans, with Mallorca priced at 2.6 and Celta Vigo at 2.95. The draw is hovering around 3.0 to 3.15, which seems about right given both teams' penchant for turning the final third into a no-go zone.

Given the historical context and the fact that both teams struggle to find the back of the net, the best bet here is the under 2.25 goals, priced at 1.87 on FanDuel. It's a safer bet than assuming your cat won't knock over your coffee in the morning.

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy what promises to be a thrilling display of defensive football. Or, you know, take a nap. Either way, you're not likely to miss much.

### What Are Adaptogenic Mushrooms?

Adaptogenic mushrooms are fungi that promote resilience to stress and help the body maintain balance. They work by supporting your adrenal system, which helps regulate your body's response to stress. Some of the most well-known varieties include:

- **Reishi:** Known as the ""king of mushrooms,"" Reishi helps promote relaxation and sleep.
- **Chaga:** Rich in antioxidants, Chaga is known for its immune-boosting properties.
- **Lion's Mane:** This mushroom supports cognitive function and may help with memory and focus.
- **Cordyceps:** Often used for boosting energy levels and athletic performance.

### Health Benefits of Adaptogenic Mushrooms

Add these powerful fungi to your wellness regimen and tap into the many positive effects they offer:

#### 1. Stress Relief

Many people experience stress daily, which can take a toll on physical and mental health. Adaptogenic mushrooms help mitigate this stress by regulating cortisol levels in your body. This means they can help you feel more relaxed and centered.

#### 2. Immune Support

Your immune system is your body's defense against illness. Adaptogenic mushrooms like Chaga and Reishi are packed with antioxidants and beta-glucans, which can enhance immune function. As a result, regular consumption may lead to fewer illnesses and faster recovery times.

I usually just mind my business. But something *weird* has been happening and it’s gotten to a point where I’m not even sure if I’m being paranoid or if I should be genuinely concerned.

I work remotely here in Chennai. My job lets me work from anywhere, so I hop around cafés—helps me focus, and let’s be honest, the coffee culture here is kind of fire. I have a rotation of places depending on my mood: sometimes the busy ones, sometimes quiet little corners where I can just disappear.

**First time:** July 2024, Starbucks at Phoenix Mall. Absolute zoo that day. I manage to grab a seat, and a girl asks if she can sit across from me. Totally normal. She had this whole curated vibe—journal, big mug, soft aesthetic, like she fell out of an Instagram reel. I was just there for the Wi-Fi. We didn’t talk. I barely looked up. Done and dusted.

**But then…**

A few weeks later I’m in this chill, low-key café on the other side of the city. I go there when I really need to focus and *not* run into people. Guess who walks in?

Same girl. Same vibe. Same... *presence*. She looks at me like she knows me. I look away. Inside, I’m trying to do the math on how likely this is. Chennai isn’t *that* small.

Still, I give her the benefit of the doubt. I leave earlier than planned. Felt kinda weird being in the same space again but hey—maybe we just have similar taste in coffee spots?

**Until this week.**

I walk into Dou, grab a solo lunch, open my laptop. Five minutes in—she walks in again. Same person. Different place. Third time. No conversation, no hello, just that same look. And now it’s not a coincidence. I feel it in my gut.

The thing is, I *never* approached her. Never even smiled. I’ve been polite, but distant. I don’t post where I’m working. I don’t tag locations. So how is this happening?

**It gets worse.**

My friend sends me this Reddit post. Some girl talking about “the guy she keeps seeing at cafés,” saying stuff like “maybe it’s fate” and “girl-from-three-cafés, if you’re reading this…” It sounds like me. The description, the timeline. I wish I were joking.

I read that and froze. Like, what? I’m not some romantic subplot. I’m just trying to get my work done without looking over my shoulder every five minutes.

So yeah. I’m venting because:

* I don’t know if this is an elaborate coincidence or some kind of creepy “serendipity” fantasy someone’s running with.
* I’m uncomfortable. And I don’t know how to say that without sounding like I’m exaggerating.
* And if by some chance *you* are reading this—*please stop.* This isn’t a movie. It’s just weird. I didn’t sign up for whatever this is.

Anyway. If anyone knows a place in Chennai with strong coffee and *zero human interaction*, drop your recs. I’m trying to work, not star in someone else’s headcanon.

1jry6ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1jry6ab/how_do_we_handle_elderly_parents_being_nasty/,How do we handle Elderly parents being nasty & intentionally cruel?,"I don't post on reddit often but I need a safe space to say this.

My Mother has always treated me nasty but then kind and caring if that makes any sense. Everyone told me when I was a teenager that I was too sensitive or that every teenager feels this way. Then I became an adult, responsible adult and it was still there. Anyone I dated was not enough, if they didn't cater to her they were a POS. She would try to sabotage my relationships, make up lies and plant them like seeds to sit back and watch the chaos. My family would say things like she want talking right or that she hooooovered over me & that she was being nasty. She leaned to say cruel hurtful things then directly reach out to the family to cover her tracks but eventually she also did that to them so they figured it out.

I became a parent and this just highlighted everything for her. If I didn't do things her way I was a terrible person. She would promise to watch my children for my 9-5 and if by chance I only brought her 1 diet pepsi that morning... she would say ""Since I do for you and you can't do for me I'm not babysitting today""... today meaning at 7am as I'm dropping off my child & the list (bag) of requests I was given. I'm not exaggerating, literally "" this is the wrong soap, I needed the 2 pack not the 4 pack... you know what... watch your own kid"". id give her gifts and she would walk over to the garage and throw it out at a birthday party... she was the same way with my baby sister but not the 2 middle siblings. So I grew closer to confiding in my father who ended up dying in my earlier 20s. I learned to except this was how she was. Boy she would instigate trying to sabotage my relationships with everyone around me, call my employers to the point that I got fired from a job because they said ""You can't keep getting personal calls, your mother needs to stop calling here 8 times a day!"". She told my boss ""too f\*\*king bad, I'll call as much as I want to, i need her to get me a coffee"". When I got fired she said I was gonna end up on welfare because nobody would hire me. Told me i was slow and I act like a re\*ard so that must be why I got fired ( my paper said the reason was based on personal calls & harassment ). Disgusted when finding out about having another grandchild. 

Also, im not saying I sat there like a victim but I learned to set boundaries. When confronting her saying she is emotional abusive she said Dear God you are so sensitive and paranoid, i feel sorry for your kids.

Years & years later I started seeing a softness in her, she was more vulnerable and scared in life so we became close so I thought. We have days where she wants to be around grandchildren, she is kind and says being around family makes me feeling so much better then days of walking in the door critiquing my house. Its never clean enough (though my siblings & i were not raised in a very clean house at all - throw the dishes out and buy new ones)​, why doesnt my spouse help with dinner, I'm a horrible parent... I'm pathetic,  why do my kids have to clean up after themselves thats my job, im just like my father, i must be mentally ill because i wash my refrigerator so much ( but i thought the house wasnt clean enough?). She cant stand me, im a paranoid idiot... i decorate my house wrong... you gained weight, youre just as f\*\*ked up as your Father, my grandparents would turn over in they're graves if they saw my house, I'm a drama pity sucker... lazy... embarrassment. Tonight was a big lined crossed, she said my kids should be taken away from me and live with my oldest... because when i walked through the room with trash bags to go outside she said if I let my garage get that bad Im a scumbag ( it was garbage night and I just cleaned our breaded dragons habitat so the bag was heavy ). Now yes i am paranoid... is she going to try to get my kids taken away wtf? My house was spotless other than a half full dishwasher. Cupboards are packed, no shortage of food.

For some back story, i live in a very ritzy area I mean Snootyville suburb, own my house but we aren't rich, keep it clean but lived in, my children have chore expectations with consequences/old enough to help out if they helped make a mess and we both work. Im nothing like her and i think it drives her batty.

The reason for this post is, is anyone else dealing with an elderly parent like this and how do you feel/deal? Any suggestions? I want the rest of these years with her to be nice for my children but also i dont want them processing the crap i did or thinking its normal? And I dont want to have the smile verbally punched off my families faces every time she is around!

I like science, art, and nice long walk on a good day. I’m not a outdoorsy or sporty person, but more of a cafe, restaurant and friday night on my big couch and blanket kind of person.

I wouldn’t describe myself as super introvert but I do enjoy alone time at home a bit too much and dislike loud party or huge crowds. I like a little bit of nature, nice beaches or short hikes, but a night in a sleeping bag in the woods would be too much nature.

Common hobbies I enjoy as well as many other people: 
- Movies, tv shows, comedies
- Music, both listening and playing
- Food, coffee, and a nice cup of tea
- Video games, but not competitively
- Books and podcasts 
- Crafty things

Some less common things about me: 
- I travel quite a lot, and I’ve lived in a couple different places across North America, Europe and Asia. I like different cultures and learning new things.
- Bo Burnham is one of my favorite comedians 
- Daniel Sloss is another one
- I don’t really watch anime except that attack on titan is one of the best story I’ve ever seen
- I just finished severance and it’s a good show
- Also just finished Project Hail Mary and I really like it
- I don’t watch any sports. Either you are the same or you have to accept I have little to no interest when you talk about it

Potentially controversial:
Here’s things that I really don’t vibe with and I want to put it out there first. You can disagree and that’s okay, it just means I’m not the friend you’re looking for.
- Smoking, vaping, and drugs
- People with messy life or go for excessive drinking when bored
- People who believe in tarot cards, astrology or psychic things
- Deeply religious 
Other than the things above I think we’re all good, we can disagree on whether it’s legal to put pineapple on a pizza and still be best friends.

If that interests you send me a message! I don’t expect a whole article about you but please at least tell me a little bit about you. Hope to hear from you!

🃏 **Cards Pulled:** Ten of Cups Reversed & Four of Cups

# 🌙 A Moment from Today:

I was zoning out at my desk again. Not in the “I need a break” kind of way, but in the “nothing feels quite right” way. It was one of those days where the code just blurred together, and I kept rewriting the same function like I was searching for some deeper meaning in it. By lunchtime, I wasn’t even hungry—I just scrolled through my phone, barely engaging with anything. My coworker asked if I wanted to grab coffee, and I hesitated for way too long before giving a half-hearted “maybe later.”

I didn’t go.

It wasn’t like anything was *wrong*, but it also wasn’t *right*. Just this quiet, gnawing feeling of dissatisfaction. Like standing in front of a fridge full of food but not wanting any of it.

# 🔮 Tarot Reflection:

Well, if these cards aren’t a perfect mirror of today, I don’t know what is. The Ten of Cups Reversed is like the anti-happily-ever-after card—things that should bring fulfillment feeling strangely hollow. And the Four of Cups? That’s textbook apathy, the emotional equivalent of shrugging at life.

It makes me think about how much I’ve been running on autopilot lately. Even when I have good moments—like getting through work without disasters or having chances to connect with people—I keep pushing them away. Maybe it’s burnout, maybe it’s just one of those weeks, or maybe I’m stuck in a cycle where nothing feels exciting because I’m too drained to engage with anything properly.

I guess the real question is: What am I actually waiting for? Some grand, magical moment to snap me out of it? Or do I need to start actively shifting my mindset instead of waiting for things to feel different?

# 🧠 Thought of the Day:

If I keep ignoring what’s in front of me, I might wake up one day and realize I’ve let too much slip away. Maybe it’s time to do something instead of waiting to feel different.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Buffalo Sabres, a classic matchup that feels like a battle between a Tesla and a horse-drawn carriage. On one hand, you have the Lightning, who are zipping around with their 44-26-5 record, looking to secure their fifth division title. On the other, you have the Sabres, with a 32-36-6 record, who are just happy to be here and not in last place.

The Lightning have been as reliable as your morning coffee, especially when they score three or more goals, boasting a 42-7-2 record in such games. Meanwhile, the Sabres are leading the league in penalty minutes per game, which is like saying they're the best at sitting in timeout. But hey, at least Tage Thompson is scoring goals like he's trying to win a bet with Alex Ovechkin.

Now, let's talk odds. The Lightning are favored at 1.5 on BetRivers, which is about as surprising as finding out water is wet. The Sabres, bless their hearts, are at 2.6, which means if you bet on them and they win, you might be able to afford a nice dinner. Maybe.

Considering the Lightning's strong road record against the Sabres and their recent form, the best bet here is to take Tampa Bay on the moneyline at 1.5. If you're feeling adventurous, you could also consider the Lightning covering the -1.5 spread at 2.26, but only if you're feeling particularly confident in their ability to not let the Sabres' recent home streak get in their way.

And for those who enjoy a little chaos, the over on 6.5 total goals at 2.0 could be a fun ride, given the last matchup ended 6-5. But remember, betting on the Sabres to win is like betting on a snowstorm in July—possible, but not probable.

So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and enjoy the show. Just don't forget to thank me when the Lightning light up the scoreboard like a Christmas tree.

1jrxsht,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrxsht,International Snickers Part 2,"In my last post I shared the 4 Snickers I bought online. They all came from countries outside of the US which are Australia, Brazil and India. People wanted a report back on how they were so here's my review of each, from my most to least favorite flavors.

#1 Butterscotch - Made in India.      8/10
   This one is great. It's a perfect blend of chocolate, caramel and butterscotch flavor. You can even smell Butterscotch when you open it up. The Indian made bars seem to be wider but slightly shorter but the drizzle on top being different than what I'm used to is nice.

#2 Morango - Made in Brazil.     7/10
   I've never had any Snickers quite like this. You smell a strawberry scent and it tastes like  chocolate dipped strawberries with a little caramel. I never thought I'd consider a candy bar like this to be refreshing, but it kinda is. I was suprised by the pink nougat. 

#3 Coffee - Made in Australia.     7/10
   Coffee lovers will like this one. It definitely has a coffee like scent and really reminds me of a caramel mocha. The coffee flavored nougat isn't too strong but it mixes with the other ingredients well. I wish we had these here in the US.

#4 Berry Whip - Made in India     4/10
   I wasn't too sure about this one but I wanted to like it. It smells and tastes like strawberries and cream with chocolate. Still has that different drizzle like the Butterscotch one and the same size, but it's not for me. You might like it more than I do, so it's still worth a try.


Hopefully this actually helped someone who really wanted to know what these were like.",3,1743836999.0,candy,0,1.0,False

our story begins when audrey, (now with control over the cycle) went to get some coffee from downstairs. But when she returned, she realised the book controlling the cycle disappeared! She realised someone stole it, and took it for themself. in the cycle, we pan to a lost one named Michelle. Michelle is in Charge of searching for supplies to keep the lost ones safe & healthy, but when she exits, she notices a stairwell she didn’t notice before. She goes through it and ends up on another floor of the studio: Level M. She searches for any life, but comes across a GENT Pipe. This seems to have been upgraded by someone… and she then is ambushed by the butcher gang. they knock her out, but before She blacks out, a mysterious figure takes out all the butcher gang.

**CHAPTER 1: “IN A DARK PLACE”**

Michelle then wakes up to find herself inside some sort of bedroom, and then she exits the room and finds herself inside some sort of safehouse. She then meets a searcher-lost one-mix whose name is Allen. allen agrees to help Michelle find out the secrets of the lost Levels. Allen gives Michelle a key and she leaves. Michelle comes across a door, and it could only be opened by a switch in a nearby storage room. The storage room is gated of though, and Allen seeps under the gate. She then flicks the lever and leaves Michelle to fight for herself. After entering the door, we see a small figure scurrying away. Michelle corners the figure, and it’s revealed to be a small fellow named “Benny.” Benny is small, scared, and has a mechanical arm that can access executive-access doors. they both briefly encounter a version of The Ink Demon. This is a minion of the much more big And powerful Ink Demon. Michelle and Benny both get in a little miracle station, and the demon leaves them alone. They both press on and enter a small storage room. After getting swarmed by searchers, they continue into a large storage warehouse. here, Michelle finds a GENT Pipe upgrade. a syringe for getting rid of searchers easier. They come across a flooded staircase that they need to drain. *\*The ink can only be drained via. Pipe. But the pipe is missing a valve. Suddenly, a crashing noise is heard behind them. a lost one with some sort of female bendy face? It was Ella. A humanoid version of a cartoon character that was bendy‘s sworn enemy named Ellen Demon. but this one was different. She wore overalls and used a pipe wrench. Michelle and carla protect Benny from being hurt by Ella and kill her.\** After that, the ink started groaning… the ink was calling her… a big glowing spiral appeared on her left hand and torso… She could now **BANISH.** they find a valve and they insert it into a pipe. The stairwell drains And They eventually make it to Level 8. They both see another Ink Demon Minion, this time being battled by a lost one. This time wearing overalls and welding a wrench, and an axe. the Ink Demon Minion runs from her and disappeared into a wall. It is revealed her name is Carla, and she trusts Michelle because she took care of Benny for her. They both wander into a safehouse of sorts where there is a bunch of friendly lost ones and a pile of bacon soup cans. Carla explains how the Ink Demons Michelle has met were mere clones of a much larger, more powerful ink demon. Located in a large cavern containing a gigantic “REEL INK MACHINE.” and the only way to defeat the REEL Ink Demon, he Has to first be vulnerable. And you do this by turning off the REEL INK MACHINE.

**”CHAPTER 2: OLD FAMILY RECIPE”**

They all exit the safehouse, and get attacked by more searchers, but this time, Michelle has an upgraded GENT Pipe. She easily takes them out. They find a large room With giant vats of Bacon Soup. AKA: The Bacon Soup Production Plant. After turning on the Bacon Soup Machines, the exit is unlocked, *\*revealing a giant Ink Demon Minion. This one looks tough. After staying quiet and hiding behind the Bacon Soup Vats and using sound to lure it away from the exit door, the gang makes a quick escape into the next room.\** the gang find an elevator that has 3 buttons. One to Level M, Level 8, and Level D. They all go to level D, and get out of the Elevator. they wander down a corridor and see Sammy walking down the end of it. He notices The gang and quickly hides behind a door, which he locks. The gang wander around and enter a room where there’s another section of the Bacon Soup Production plant. This time, there are winding corridors and offices, and there are lost ones wandering all around. after The gang navigates the offices they end up at a large bendy statue in front of a giant vat of bacon soup. the door that sammy went through required a key. And that key was somewhere in the area… behind the bendy statue, there were the studios “Visual Design Offices.” But now these halls lurk with Lost ones with machines for their heads… they all welded different weapons and all were roaming the halls of the offices. after the gang followed arrows drawn on walls while being undetected by “THE LOST MACHINES” they found a large two story office. In this office there was a man who Michelle had heard on tapes. He was the head of the Visual Design Offices and he had the keys to all the doors in the cycle. His name was Richard. he called the  LOST MACHINES to his office and they had a big fight. After a long battle with tons of LOST MACHINES, they got up to Richard‘s desk And banished Richard And took his keys. But when Michelle **BANISHED** Richard, the ink called again. the Spiral on her torso stretched to her right hand… she could now summon sculptures of ink With **EASE.** After they unlocked the room Sammy entered, Sammy ambushed them, resulting in a boss fight. after the gang defeated Sammy, they got to a part where three levers must be flicked at the same time. After the gang does so, there are bashing and clanging sounds coming from Benny‘s location. Carla runs to investigate and a door shuts behind Michelle. Leaving Michelle alone. She finds a long corridor with a door at the end of it. She walks up to it and enters the room.

**“CHAPTER 3: DARK PUDDLES”**

*\*She ends up in a small room with the door to the next room with “CAVERN” written above it. But the door to the next room is covered with some sort of immovable “Blue Thick Ink.” Suddenly, Michelle hears a voice behind her. And on the ground there is a puddle of blue ink that forms into a Small Girl. Made of blue ink. She asks what Michelle was doing there, and Michelle asks to go to the next room, but the small Girl says it’s too dangerous. Michelle uses Her “EASE” ability to make a sculpture of a bendy doll. she gives the sculpture to the Blue Thick Ink, and she accepts it. she collides with the blue thick ink wall and shrinks to become a small ball of blue thick ink with a small face. Michelle holds the blue thick ink creature in her hand and enters the next room.\** the next room is a control room with a pedestal in the center. There’s a big window and two doors left and right. Suddenly, the wall where the window was, is broken open, revealing a giant ink demon standing in-front. The REEL INK DEMON. Michelle must navigate through caves all around the large cavern while trying to find three objects and place them in three control rooms. *\*All while staying out of sight from the REEL INK DEMON. who has a projector on its shoulder which it can see Michelle with. Unless she hides Behind an object. She goes through a door in the back of the main control room and enters winding hallways. but there is another monster lurking nearby. a twisted version of a cartoon character: Ellen Demon wanders the halls. After Michelle attacks and defeats the Monster, it drops the first object. she enters the next room and finds the second object and places It on one of the pedestals. She goes to the third control room and finds and places the last object.\** She goes to the first control room and pulls a switch in the center of the room. after that, it turns off the REEL INK MACHINE. this opens a door to her right. *\*The blue thick ink jumps off of michelle‘s shoulder, and moulds into a more human form, this time wearing a bow On her head. She introduces herself as “Milly.”\** Michelle goes through the newly opened door. behind it is a stairwell, and at the bottom is a tram. She enters the tram and it goes through a door. a door closes behind the tram and another one opens in-front. the tram goes through a long, inky pipe.

**”CHAPTER 4: INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCT”**

another door closes behind the tram and one opens Infront revealing a tram station. *\*Milly and\** Michelle navigate through some mysterious corridors and even Enters a recreation of the foyer of chapter 1 of Bendy And The Ink Machine. She tries going To where the exit door was, but there is a gate in the way. She must open it. She goes to where henrys desk would be, but she finds a room full of jail cells. One with Tom and Allison, one with Sammy, one with The Projectionist, and one with Henry. She talks to Allison and Tom, and they tell her that to make things go back to normal, she needs to find a film reel labelled “THE END.” And Allison tells Michelle that the ink demon Used an ink machine thing to make himself one with the end reel. trapping it inside him. After that Michelle enters a hole in a wall in the tram Station, and it lead to a room that has three pedestals… it looks like there are three more that used to be there, but are now not. She exits out a door and finds a large room with a shelf with large Ink pipes above, and a large ink tank to the side. Infront of it is a power switch. But the switch does nothing. She finds the three missing objects in the BATIM chapter 1 recreation and puts Them on the three pedestals. She pulls the switch That did nothing, and it did something. The door that lead to the exit in the chapter 1 recreation opened. But behind the gate was an elevator. She goes up and there is two big tubes. She enters through An open door in one of the tubes, *\*and Milly turns a machine on,\** and Michelle gets sucked through inky pipes through the REEL INK MACHINE. She come out as a cartoonish-human. more of a silhouette, but human. She was made of ink But wasn’t dripping everywhere? but then… the ink called again. the spiral then connected to her legs. She could now go into certain puddles, and climb out of other ones. *\*she Had to leave Milly behind though… but she couldn’t handle that. so Michelle tells Milly to merge with her, and they become one. now, Michelle was coated with Blue Thick* Ink.\* She entered a puddle, and came out in another train station. she got on a tram…

**”CHAPTER 5: THE END.”**

and it led to an area where she found a dock where she found a boat. She went through a door and behind it was ladder. This lead to a long hallway and at the end she was met with another control room. She met up with Carla and Benny who were in the control room. Carla commented on Michelle’s human appearance and brushed it off. the Ink demon was still a threat though. So they had to act quickly. carla went to a control panel and operated a giant crane and helped Michelle to defeat the ink demon. Michelle found A drill and used it to attack the giant ink demon. When Carla hit the demon and had it knocked over, michelle travelled To the ink demon through the ink and hacked the demon to pieces. and when it was weak enough, Michelle dove Into the demon through a hole on his back. Michelle traversed tunnels inside of the ink demon and found a film reel in his chest labelled “The End.” Michelle took this item and escaped the demon. When she got out, she went to the crane control room and a Door has opened. She walks through and finds a pipe in the ground. *\*Milly Then un-merges with Michelle and appears as an exact copy of her. Milly, Michelle, Carla and benny\** all Jump into the pipe, and end up in *\*a long hallway with signs on the walls saying “PROJECTOR ROOM.” a door opened behind them and an Army of searchers, lost ones, LOST MACHINES, and butcher gang members give chase to Milly, Michelle, Carla, and Benny. they run to the end of the winding corridors\** and end up in a room with a projector in the centre. Michelle placed the “THE END” Reel on it, but was ambushed by a group of searchers, lost ones, LOST MACHINES, and butcher gang members. but then, the gang came back together and fought them all off. Everyone was there, including Allen! After a battle, Michelle placed the film reel on the projector, and turned it on… *\*the projector showed something on the wall. it showed a end card with “THE END” on it Before flashing white. the lights in the room flickered brighter…*

*light. That’s what it was… just, light…\**

**“EPILOGUE”**

Michelle woke up in joeys abandoned apartment as a human in normal clothes. She looked around The abandoned apartment and found *\*something… papers… all with… stuff on them? Drawings… Michelle walked through a door, and ended up at arch gate pictures. She sees a book thats on audrey‘s work desk, And takes it to fix the cycle. she opens The book, and inside Is a drawing… of the lost ones safe house… she looks deeper… and becomes one with the image…\** she then entered the lost ones’ safe house.

I recall a man that works in an office under tight security, there's a camera that points to him and his Computer. He appears to be trying to steal company/computer data. When he stands up, he does something with his hand that's blocked by his body; like plugging something in, or putting in a floppy disk? He picks up his cup, walks towards the security camera, holds it up, and tells the guards he's going for Coffee.

It shows the guards recording the time stamp of his break. He seems to leave to the bathroom, adds water to the cup, and messes with some gadgets or tools.

He heads back, checks back in with the security camera, and sits down to resume working.

That's all I can recall, I've long forgotten what movie this is and what it's overall about since it's from my early childhood. I'm just interested to find it again and check it out if anyone can help out with that.

* Last night I dreamed I was getting bullied by my old friend. Like, emotionally and physically bullied. It was great -_-

* Mum and I went to visit dad in hospital. He was so tired and not very well. I was *not* prepared to see my dad in essentially a diaper. He got moved to by the nurses station because he wouldn’t ring it when he needed help so now they can keep an eye on him. We brought him a hot chocolate but that, along with our two coffees, spilled ALL over the car because pups jumped on the seat they were sat on. Our fault for putting them there tbf, we weren’t upset with pups like I mean let’s be real we never are, he doesn’t remember long enough for it to be warranted and a lot of the time he’s set up to be boisterous yknow. I also took him for a 30 min *power walk* and was sweating as it was also muggy and felt so ick but it felt good to move. 

* I’ve had that heart on fire song stuck in my head all day. I wanna rewatch that movie. I used to loveeee it. 

* I baked dad some berry bran muffins and mum some afghan biscuits this evening. I haven’t tried either as I don’t feel like it but they both *look* kinda perfect? 

* I also made us dinner at the same time, and cleaned up the kitchen. Model daughter, no? 

And otherwise I’ve felt so tired all day. 

He said last night he hasn’t changed any WhatsApp settings. So… idk? It’s just odd that it happens with him and NOONE else. M whatsapped me earlier a video about keto and mental health and how it can help heal your brain anyway and that has blue ticks. So. Idk I’m going to try move past it but it seems like he has changed his settings and he just isn’t telling me. And that makes me uncomfortable because it’s a SETTING why would you not admit to that? Unless he’s actively trying to not let me see something or something idk. Something just feels off. But again, I can’t trust my gut feeling because of my anxiety riddled mind so I have to just sit with this wrong gut/intuition feeling and I hate this feeling. But also what reason do I have to not trust him, yknow? So I’m choosing to try move past it and drop it but that feeling is still lingering. WHY? 

I can’t decide if I go back home on Monday? I have a GP appointment that I want to attend but also… maybe I should stay here as dad will likely still be in hospital. And it would help mum for me to be here. Hmmmmm.

I just want to let things off my chest so I can gain some sort of peace. Thanks for understanding. -**

Hello fellow grieving people, I'm Elanie, I'm 25 and I lost my mom to suicide on 2/22.2025. She was only 51 years old. She died by overdose. Words can't describe what I'm feeling right now, these days and weeks. I came here to let everything out, to maybe ease the feelings of guilt a little bit - which will probably haunt me forever anyways

My mom's struggles started since she was 3, when her father passed. She had a sick brother and a mom taking care of everything. She was always so kind, smart and talented - she played the piano so well, could knit and sew really beautiful things and growing up in communist Czechoslovakia, she was always dressed very modernly, because she was wearing her own stuff. She was vibrant, elegant, smart and funny. 

She married my father when she was 19, then lived some time in UK too, came back home, got pregnant with me and got divorced. Even before the pregnancy my mom already suffered from anxiety, depression and later was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. After I was born, she started taking antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines. She was on this combo for 10 years, and we lived in a 2 room apartment with my grandma, who took all the care of us. She's 73 now and still working.

Even despite the fact that she never worked and slept so much during my childhood, she was the perfect mom, gave me love, educated me, taught me to read and write by the age of 3 and made me do calculus by the age of 5. She did so much more, but that wouldn't be a post, but a book. 

She told me many times I was her reason to live. She didn't have anyone beside me and her mom and she willingly let go of any other outside relationships (like in a parents groups on playgrounds). Our roles became enmeshed and I was emotionally parentified.  By the age of 6 I knew all of her history, her love life, her struggles, her meds, her diagnosis. I was an emotional anchor, a kid-therapist, someone who always made decisions based on how my mom would feel about that. Mom was paranoid towards my grandma, always accusing her she wants to take away her rights and oftentimes denied me talking to her or interacting with her. Despite all of that, I was happy, in a room with her. I was a happy kid, maybe too much aware, but she was still providing me care, we were taking care of each other. 

She was taking me regularly on her psychiatrist appointments, and talked to her psychiatrist while I was in the room with her, she wanted to be transparent with me. Her psychiatrist once set me aside when I was 9 and told me this diagnosis is progressive and it's gonna get worse, so I might wanna get ready for that.

My mom abruptly stopped taking all of her meds when I was 10 which sent her into psychotic break and things changed, she was admitted in psych ward for 3 months. By doing what she did, she damaged her brain and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with episodes of active hallucinations. I was admitted to psych ward too, I had trauma from how she shifted, because I was 10 and did not understand that shift. That's the first time in my life I experienced true anxiety and I was put on antipsychotic meds for a month.

With that diagnosis, she felt worse, and started declining even more. Our lives got back to normal, I was again a happy and stable kid. But she always struggled with hygiene and keeping up with stuff, she just gained more and more weight, she barely left her bed, never went out, refused any physician appointments. She had another relapse when I was 18, and then she was stably put on olanzapine and haloperidol for the next 7 years, until she died. She was so withdrawn she didn't even know exactly where my high school is because she's never been there.

While everything happened, I tried to live my own life too. I was sharing a room with mom, lived at home and tried to keep her happy but also keep myself happy, while navigating school and part time jobs. I spent much time outside with friends and boyfriends, but she was sometimes so sad I wasn't spending time with her instead. She sometimes accused me of not being able to love family, of not loving her, and was calling me so much too. Her reason for living started to live too, and she took it really badly at first but she was very intelligent, so she knew it has to happen. I'm not perfect either. I was very dramatic as a teen, had 2 attempts myself after a breakup (but they were more like a cry for help), I was treated on and off with antidepressants and benzos by mom's psychiatrist from the ages of 15 to 18, got into drinking and weed smoking, I didn't know how to emotionally regulate myself that much.

For the last 7 years, mom declined more and more. After I moved out it was really bad. Trash on her coffee table (even used pads), she didn't shower for months, she never got checked, she refused appointments. Grandma brought in all the groceries, cooked all the meals. Mom didn't even attend her psych appointments, she just called in for prescriptions. 

Because she didn't move much for years, her physical health problems started accumulating. We had to call ambulance multiple times - she had arrhythmia, 3 years of uterine bleeding, recent Bell's palsy, was scheduled to have her uterus removed, should have gone to get a cardiostimulating device ... there was a lot to be done. We didn't even know exactly what's wrong, because she would never go anywhere besides the times the paramedics take her into ER.

I moved out 3 years ago, but I still showed up, talked to her, spent time watching TV with her, describing my workplace, my coworkers, taught her how to use Messenger, we did video calls, sometimes 3 hours long, even more. I tried to show up in the best possible way I could.

I tried to motivate her all my life, to keep her going. I always believed in her abilities and her unique personality that still shined under all of that. But I must admit - for the past year, I've been a bit withdrawn - I came home maybe once a week instead of 3, mom called me so much I had 20 missed calls a day (that was normal, once I had 80 missed calls in a span of 2 hours). She was saying that she's sad - and I told her ""mom, but you're always sad"". Sometimes I got angry with her too - especially when she tried to guilt trip me or I was overwhelmed. I sometimes raised my voice and always explained things rationally and sometimes I wasn't the best at delivery of these things.   
  
Knowing, that reacting differently might have changed it all breaks my heart. But I wasn't doing it out of spite - I tried everything. I tried to give her daily plans, to organize her life, to be gentle, soft, even angry if softness didn't work, I suggested activities, buying a piano, a sewing machine, to suggest I'll stop smoking if she starts working out... We also made many plans, to go grocery shopping, or go to a concert and she almost always cancelled. She went out maybe 3 times a year, always by a taxi.

My grandma was scared what will happen if she will die and I'll stay with mom on my own. She was scared at how would I handle it and she was open about it even in front of my mom, as we never had any filter or secrets as a family.  
  
3 months ago I talked to my mom and tried to explain, ""Mom you, gotta help us a bit, grandma is 73 and still working, I'm 25, working too, trying to put my life, you, work, everything together too as a young person. Nobody pushes you to go out if you're not comfortable, just do one tiny thing every day - like clean your coffee table, the next day wash the dishes, the next day shower, etc, and you'll feel proud of yourself"".  
  
I also told her many times, she has to want to do these things for her own self, not for me. She may make my life easier by doing this, but I needed her to like herself just a tiny bit. I tried to teach her the concept of self-love, but she couldn't kinda grasp it for herself.

For the past year, I've been getting off antidepressants, I was diagnosed with panic disorder 1,5 years ago, cause the attacks started abruptly when I applied to college and did night shifts most of the time, I lost weight and was unhealthy. I'm in remission now and meds free, but that was also the reason I've been more irritable and withdrawn. I hoped my mom would have understood, because she was very experienced in this. 

The last time I spoke to her was a day before she took her life - we briefly called and checked in. She texted me night before she did this, but I was already home, tired from a long day at work and didn't catch it. The next day, I was heading off to another shift in the afternoon, but I don't know, why didn't I call my mom. She was always calling me so I kinda expected her to call whenever she's awake and wants to talk, she used to bomb my phone 24/7, but started also taking breaks from that since I tried to tell her so many times it's not necessary. So I figured out she's just asleep, I don't wanna wake her up, or she'll call if she needs me.

I had a break at work at 3pm. I texted my mom a heart emoji and wondered if I should call. I had the call log open and could make one tiny call. I had no missed calls. I chose not to call. I was selfish with my 30 minute break to not offer a minute or two to call. I'll never stop regretting this.

I got home late, didn't call, didn't even really checked my phone. I went to sleep and my grandma called me the next day in the morning, that my mom's dead. She didn't leave any note or letter, but she got dressed and ate all of her food for her day before doing so.

By the autopsy report, she probably did that shortly before I was supposed to go on my shift and she did take 40 times the lethal dose of one of her medication, and extremely lethal doses of another two. Her autopsy report was also the first whole doctor checkup we could get and we found out she had more than 8 physical diagnoses including gallstones, lung edema and dangerously enlarged spleen and liver. If she didn't change anything in her life and kept going like this, she would have had maybe 3 or 5 more years to live.

I'm still wondering and blaming myself - if I'd call her, would I be able to save her? If we did save her, would it still be the mom I knew? Would she be aware of her surroundings? Would have it been better than this - for her, for grandma, for me? Did she want to be saved by me so I would give her more care and affection? And about me not calling her that - does that make me selfish? Those are questions that will always stay with me ... I'm gonna go to therapy soon but it still haunts me and probably will for a very long time. 

Her story is something very unique and I just want say I love her very much, illness doesn't make someone a bad parent, she was a fantastic mom despite the circumstances.

In control of myself and my life. I guess that’s part of the entitlement of being a white male, and I’d love to give you the opportunity to overturn it.  

I’ve been almost obsessing about this for a long time — having my control taken from me, and taught my place. And part of what *really* turns me on is inverted power dynamics: a woman conquering a man, the young and innocent corrupting the mature, the strong and muscular submitting to the petite, the experienced kneeling for the beginner.  

The thought of being dominated by somebody decades younger than me, by an absolute beginner, is so humbling, yet so powerfully hot. Being put in my place by a girl who can barely vote or maybe even drink makes me weak in the knees. Imagine forcing a mature, confident man to do things you might be embarrassed to say to any normal boyfriend, but that would make you feel empowered with me. Your toy  

I’m not feminine or looking to be sissified — to me, the beauty in submission is in being masculine and confident and strong and still submitting myself to you. Still being a man and all that entails, but respecting you as the feminine goddess you are while you take what you deserve from me.  

I’m pretty down to earth, fit and healthy, and I don’t use drugs. I’m happy to host after a public meet for coffee or something.

I’m handsome and strong and successful and used to getting attention from women. But with you, I want to be taken out of my comfort zone, to have you be in control, to feel conquered and wrecked and completely fucking owned.

my title might be a bit misleading because I am not directly looking for answers, this is going to be more like a snapshot of what's going on in my head.

A little bit about myself: I recently finished the educational part of my university (think lectures and exams) and just now started working in a corporation to begin my masters thesis. With that pressure of always needing to prepare for the next exam or assignment I hit a bit of a slouch.   
If people ask me what I like to do and what my interests are I always tell them ""I collect hobbies like they are Pokemon"", because that's what I do. If I find something that interests me in that moment I will obsessively learn about it and immerse myself in it. For the most part these may be considered ""nerdy"" or ""unnecessary"" for most people.

A few examples:  
\- I enjoy coffee and everything that comes with it, be it brew-techniques, finding new coffee or trying to brew the best coffee I can in my home  
\- Mechanical Keyboards and trying to improve my typing  
\- dabbling in retro-emulation  
\- researching gadgets and small things/workflows to make my life easier

These are just a few things that interest me and there are many more. I've heard people tell me that the things that interest me are not necessary for modern life and are just ""nice to have"". This doesn't discourage me because I do these things for me. I have this drive to try and optimise ""the small things"" like: Most people drink coffee every day of their adult life, why not make that as pleasant as it can be? Shaving, a chore for most guys, why not spice it up with an old school safety razor?  
You get the gist.

Most of the time I am not simply ""content"" with the way things are ""out of the box"" and I want to make the most of it. Thus I am a person who knows a little about a lot of things and I even for the things I don't find interesting I can get why other people do.

This brings me back to the title. I have all these topics and I want to do something with it. I would not classify myself as ""creative"" as I am not good with things like painting or photography. Picture me more like a walking Wikipedia article.

I am looking for something where I can share what interests me at that particular point of time. Like a blog where I do ""weekly updates of my life"" or Journaling. Do you have any ideas of what I could do or how I could share what interests me?",1,1743835648.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

When I was growing up my mom and dad would argue all the time. They would scream, get the cops called on them, throw dishes and break things up until my dad committed adultery and they divorced. Granted my mom wasn’t an angel either. She suffered from a lot of mental disorders and would constantly present me and my sister with traumatic memories I hold to this day. Since this is anonymous I will elaborate; during an argument with my father she locked herself in the closet where all of our guns were kept and tried to off herself. Luckily my father kicked the wooden door down with his bare foot and stopped her. (His foot was so cut up from the door he had to get stitches and couldn’t walk on it for a few months) All of this unfolded while I stood in the hallway and watched. She would spiral some days and curl into a ball screaming to god that he should take her off this planet. She would grab me and my sister and dig her nails into our arms until we bled when we did not listen. She convinced us that my father was the devil and wanted to kill all of us so we all had to sleep in the same room with the door locked and the outside checked before the blinds being shut, during this time I had to sleep on a mattress on the floor. Some days she would load me up into her van and stalk my father with her, sometimes she would have me go up to the windows for her to see what was going on inside the building he was in. I broke my arm when I was 13 and had to wait an entire week before going to the hospital because I had to “wait until it was my fathers time” for custody as it was not her problem to deal with. These are just a few stories off of the top of my head. At one point I had had enough of it and felt I was her caretaker more than her son so I walked out of her house and never looked back. I convinced my sister to do the same. As I have grown older and gone longer without seeing or talking to her I have felt overwhelmed with the guilt of no longer seeing her. I picture her living alone in the small house we used to share, once as a big family and now, all alone. No-one to help her when she’s spiraling, nobody to console her tears. It’s upsetting. I’ve tried to communicate to her and plan things out with her but she doesn’t respect boundaries. She has showed up to my job unannounced, she has spoken to my sisters pastor/boss (she works at the church) and she has bad mouthed me to teachers I used to have in school. It’s things like that that remind me I need to keep my distance. Recently, I’ve grown really fond of legos again and I think it’s because I want to rekindle feelings from my childhood again that were good to me. As I see more old Lego sets on Instagram or YouTube I start to realize how many great sets I had, and who got them for me. I had a trampoline in my backyard and a play set to go along with it. I went on vacations and trips with my mom I’ll never be able to go on again. She gave my sister the family minivan as her first car. One time I had set out to acquire every toy in the McDonald’s Indiana Jones collection so my mom literally drove to every McDonald’s in the area to help me get them. I had a really great childhood thanks to my mom, but I had a really traumatic childhood thanks to my mom. It makes me feel as though I was being an entitled teenager and that’s just how it is with parents sometimes. They are just as tough to manage as the child sometimes. So now I feel as though I stripped a struggling mother of her son and her daughter and left her with nothing. I want to see her again but I fear she has not changed and might be worse than I remember, but there is also the possibility she’s okay now. I feel so guilty now, and if she were to die today…I would feel so terrible. I don’t know what the right thing to do is anymore. And I don’t know if I ever really did the right thing either.




Update:
Well I saw her. It was the first time I had seen her in years, five or six actually. This Reddit thread really helped me and was what made me make the decision to do it. When I wrote my experience growing up it was during a time where I was really struggling mentally with these conflicting thoughts and emotions towards seeing her again or never seeing her again. You guys helped me to put things into perspective and didn’t shame the thought process I had. Thank you. I took the advice from a few saying I should start with very small visits in public places so we went and got coffee at a local diner I live near. I didn’t have a car at the time so she drove about 2 hours to come to me. We talked. It was good, but it was also pretty sad. She didn’t know who I was, and I didn’t know her. Two strangers getting coffee really. I told her about my major in college and she told me about the places she had been. She had really wide eyes and a huge smile the whole time. It was kind of awkward because I didn’t understand why she was doing it the entire time. She asked me about my sister and if she will ever talk to her again and I told her I didn’t know. Then it was over. Time had passed, there was nothing left to be said and we went our separate ways. 



I can’t exactly explain the feeling that I had but it wasn’t a content or reliving feeling. It just felt grey, numb. Like okay it’s done, but I don’t feel anything. Looking back and rereading my original thread though I’m acknowledging that I no longer have these aggressively conflicting thoughts anymore so that’s nice. This thing isn’t following me anymore. But with something like this there should be contingency right?



So Christmas Day came. The thoughts came back. Her alone, in that house. No family, no children, no love. So I went to her house. I texted her first, to let her know I wanted to come. But she didn’t know I was coming, I weirdly felt that that would be better, I felt like if I gave her time to plan my arrival she would make sure my grandma and aunts are there and then that could end up being a mirage on me. So within 20 minutes I left my dad’s house and I was at her place. Oddly enough though she had presents for me and my sister packaged and ready to be opened. I asked her why because clearly she had no idea I was coming and she told me she does it every year “just in case” ugh. Fucked me up so bad. Well I opened it and it was candy from places she visited, this necklace from Iceland with a letter that she wrote, it was some quote from Iceland and she burned the edges of the paper to make it look cool. All that and $100, I only mention this because when I left I asked her if she wanted me to take my sisters bag and give it to her and she said no because her bag also had $100 and she didn’t want anything happening to it. Idk. Didn’t sit right with me. Not sure what the thought process there was but to me it felt like she thought I was going to take it for myself which was messed up. Sorry getting sidetracked here.



Anyways the visit was nice, but a bit weird. She still has my room and my sisters room exactly the same as it was from 7 years ago, except my sisters room had a million strings of duct tape coming from all sides of the walls and ceiling holding up a laptop in the middle of the room. Looked schizophrenic. She told me it was because she likes doing work on her computer in my sister’s room but her desk fell apart so she used the duct tape to hold up the computer. Hopefully I’m explaining that in a way that makes sense but it looked crazy. I also think it’s weird she kept our rooms intact because there are only five rooms in that house, so two of them being our old rooms, her room, the kitchen, and the living room. 



Anyways, after we finished the tour of the exact same house from 7 years ago we sat and watched some Saturday Night Live together, not my type of show but I guess my mom liked it because she was laughing really hard at it. Like really hard at it. Losing her breath and veins coming out of her neck. It was weird as fuck. So yea I don’t know I was only there for about an hour but I think she’s losing it in that house. Can’t really blame her though. It’s just a shame because there was a small part of me that thought she would be normal at last but the little things that I shared showed me she’s still kind of lost. 



Oh yea and my experience with the broken arm actually came up. I asked her if she remembered when I broke it and she actually said the words “I can’t believe you went that long without saying anything to anyone” I was 13. I said something. Multiple times. I begged. I was called a liar, crybaby, and to wait until I went to my dad’s next week. 



My blood was boiling but I held my tongue. Fuck it. What’s the use? On one hand I want to act like I held my tongue and swallowed my pride because I’m better than that but in reality I held my tongue because I was scared. I just let it go because I didn’t want to go anywhere near an argument. I have enough memories. 



If you have read to this point I appreciate you for taking the time to read the update, it’s a lot. I apologize. I’ll leave it here though, I haven’t seen her since that day, I sometimes answer her texts but it’s pretty rare. I don’t really plan on seeing her anytime soon either, although I told my sister that I saw her and now she’s thinking about it too. Mainly to get her old childhood stuff back but she wants me to be there. She also doesn’t think she can go sober which feels really childish to me but who knows maybe I’ll have another interesting update for you guys (Joking). I don’t feel that much better about the situation or my feelings though. They are not as persistent anymore and I don’t have a crossroad with them anymore. So that’s good.



 I wish I had a good mom growing up, or even now, but I don’t, and I never will. After acknowledging that thought I think I need to work on myself and what that does to somone. How it affects them and how I am probably missing a few things because of that. I need to figure out what these missing things are and work from there. Did I make the right decision seeing her? I don’t think there was a “right” decision here honestly. But I did see her. And now I move forward.

One of my closest friends—someone I’ve known for five years—is just exhausting to be around now. I’ve tried to be supportive because I know she struggles with her mental health and finances, but lately, I’m at my breaking point. She never pays for anything. I’ve covered meals, drinks, coffee, you name it—without ever asking for anything in return. Then out of nowhere, she Venmo requests me $5 for snacks. It felt ridiculous and honestly kind of insulting.

She makes other people uncomfortable, too. She’s asked my boyfriend and his friends (who barely know her) to buy her drinks. She even said outright, “I don’t want to spend money,” but still expects others to cover for her. And the worst part? She made a racially insensitive comment to my boyfriend’s South Asian friend while drunk, apparently she asked him if he personally related to Life of Pi, unfortunately I later find out this wasn't the first time she did this. It was beyond uncomfortable.

She also ghosted me for a full week after staying over at my place—completely bailed on a networking event we were supposed to attend the next day. No heads-up, no apology, no explanation. I reached out multiple times and got radio silence. Then, when she was visibly struggling in class, I pulled her aside to help calm her down and even suggested she speak to our professor. She just ran out, leaving me to awkwardly explain things on her behalf. I feel like I’m constantly cleaning up after her chaos.

Then there’s another friend who never makes time for me. I have to plan something weeks in advance just to maybe see her. She rarely responds to texts, and she completely missed my birthday—said she’d take me out but never followed through. It’s clear I’m not a priority to her, and that really stings.

Other friends flake so often that I’ve stopped reaching out altogether.

I’m proud of myself for making it to graduation, but I hate that I feel so disconnected and unimportant to the people I’ve surrounded myself with. I’ve given so much—emotionally, mentally, sometimes even financially—and I feel like I’m constantly on the back burner in return.

What makes this more confusing is that the first friend dedicated part of her art thesis to me. She’s told me I’m such a big part of her life, and I know she means it. But I don’t know how to reconcile that with the way she treats me. I don’t want to be the reason someone spirals, but I also can’t keep setting myself on fire just to keep someone else warm.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of friendship burnout at the end of college? I feel so done, and so tired of carrying it all. What will post grad be for me?

1jrxael,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jrxael/need_some_advice_on_brand_new_silvia_pro_x/,need some advice on brand new [Silvia pro x],"It looks elegant and robust, feel free to give me any suggestions: 

1) pressure gauge reads 8.1/8.2 when standby (turned on-light on but no brewing), is it ok or insufficient?

2) stock filters (8g and 16g?) get stuck in the portafilter and it's hard to detach them since they are tight, maybe it's because of the raised edge on the inside surface? In such case how do you detach them usually without using any sharp item? I also tried an IMS aftermarket one (20g) and it fits well with no clicks so it's easier to remove

3) when securing the portafilter it doesn't line up perfectly to the dark marker embossed on the group body just above, is it ok to not tighten it too firmly? The are no leaks of course when brewing

4) temp gets to 93° Celsius quicker than expected (less than 10' which is remarkable) but how can I tell when it's fully ready to brew as suggested by the manual? (It says 15' but there is no indicator light)

5) brew switch is on/off so no chance to make it automatic by time and recurrent? Do I have to press it once to start and again to end every time?

6) as for maintenance do you suggest to change the descaler bag once in 3/4 months (2 pics attached)? I'm following the advice on the manual which refers to the water reservoir and its rate of refills according to my consumption patterns
(I estimated 6/8 coffees for me and my gf)

7) I'm attaching 2 pics for reference, can you confirm how often you clean the group head and the steam wand via the steps showed in the manual?

Thanks 🙏

I also had a few other jobs. Movie theater. Best buy. Costco sampler dude.



All these jobs wanted me to work fri-sun and they gave me less hours because I had other jobs. I was working 3-4 jobs at any given time.

  
I remember working hard the whole time at all of them. And it always felt like you could get fired at a moments notice for leaning against a wall or something where your productivity goes down.



I moved to australia 8 years ago now. I got a 2 week certificate and started making 30 an hour pretty much instantly.

  
The money here is really nice for low level people like me. I now have heaps extra to go out and do things or travel the world. Recently bought a house. Life is great now.



But I also want to talk about work life. The feeling is still so foreign for me. The way youre treated here as an employee is like you have all the power.



Every job I've had here has started the same way. You come into work at shift start time. Then you go outside and have a smoke and chat with coworkers for 15 minutes. Even the boss will be there chatting sometimes. And everyones being paid to chat.

  
Then theres the way people work. I still cant wrap my mind around it. My coworkers atm are on 110k a year. And if asked to call rostering to look at shiftimes or something basic like that they will say ""Supply me a workphone if you want me to make calls. I'm not using MY data unless youre paying for it.""  
And the boss just goes ""Ok my bad.""

  
And if someone doesn't like working around someone they just refuse to work until they move that person. So coworkers with issues just get to pick and choose who they work with.

Taking off sick middle of the day or 5 minutes before start time as long as you get a sick note they literally cant do anything about it. And you can get a sick note here for 15 dollars at these no questions asked pharmacies.

  
Quite often I start work and my coworker wants a coffee. So he will just straight leave work and go get a coffee and a croissant. And take his time to. 30 minutes. 45 minutes. And he does this all the time.

  
Then I've got some messed up coworkers who viciously insult management. I mean fat jokes. Mental health jokes. Really really over the top. And they do it to the manager when the manager is there. And they do nothing about it. Its just accepted that workers get to wield their power over management. And when these guys do the same jokes about coworkers only then do they get fired. And it will be after like 3 or 4 warnings.

  
Being fired here is so hard to do. I caught a guy sleeping once. Literally made a bed out of the top of his desk. I'm talking shoes off. Blanket out. All the way. Management found out. And 2 weeks later I found the same guy doing the same thing on the desk. Getting paid for this! Lol.

  
Then theres crazy benefits. Penalty rates apply after 12 noon. 15 percent bonus wage. Then after 3 pm its 25 percent bonus wage. Sat is 50. Sunday is 100 percent bonus. Everyone gets 5 weeks off per year. After 10 years working for same employer you get 4 months paid leave as a gift for being there for 10 years.

On top of all that everyone gets 12.5 percent retirement fund on top of their wage. So if they make 100 dollars they actually make 112.50. And 12.50 goes to a retirement fund.



I dont know how to fully explain it to people. It is crazy how night and day worklife is in America vs Australia. Whenever I meet other americans here I feel like we are the only ones that really understand how crazy easy it is over here vs USA.",3,1743834612.0,work,4,0.72,False

1jrx4fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HungryArtists/comments/1jrx4fo/hiring_logo_design_and_possible_webpage_banner/,[HIRING]  Logo Design and Possible Webpage Banner Image.,"Heyo hiyo!

I'm looking to set up a small LLC and am hoping to find someone interested in designing my company (aka 'professional' me's) logo! This will be a solo/small team gaming company (indie TTRPG, self-funded) logo that will appear on products, be used as general LLC representation mark, and might be used on the company website and a few t-shirts or polos (for use at conventions).

So, to make sure I do the things correctly:

* I'm looking for a commercial, exclusive-use rights for the logo. Since this will be tied specifically to the company, I think this would be most appropriate. Of course, you are more than welcome to showcase the logo as part of your portfolio and such, and I'll endeavor to make the logo work worth showing with pride rather than shame.
   * I'll start the initial budget for this item at $750USD and negotiable.
   * Usage restatement: appearance on company marketable product (pdf, physical book, etc.), general company representation.
* Second, I'd like as an optional add: A banner image expansion of the initial logo design to be used as a page banner for the LLC website.
   * This will carry the same exclusivity usage and commercial licensing as the company logo, and will only appear on the company website. It will serve as a top navigational banner image.
   * If this is included, my starting budget will be an additional $1250USD and is negotiable.

So, for both items, my starting offer is $2000 USD available through PayPal, Zelle, or I will make a good faith effort through another preferred and verified payment processor.

Item Description and further Information:

* The Company is *Armen-Legg Gaming, Ltd.*
* The Company slogan is ""Because fun with friends should cost neither!""
* The Company focus is Indie development of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs)
* Logo Description:
   * I'd like the logo to be a bit cheeky, something akin to a older Comic styling of a ""manly lumberjack arm"" clasping/grabbing a ""fishnet burlesque leg with heels"".
   * The imagery, ideally, would be reminiscent of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers from *Predator* (The Epic Handshake meme).
   * If workable, the outer border would be circular and have the Abbreviated Company Name and Slogan on the border: ""Armen-Legg"" / ""'Cuz fun with Friends should cost neither!"" or similar.
      * This is a ""nice to have"" but not a ""need to have""
   * General dimensions should provide clarity of image when stamped above the pocket of a t-shirt, or be reasonably discernable when scaled down to (5 cm x 5cm) in grayscale in a book page.
* Optional Banner Description:
   * The Website navigational banner should extend from the base logo imagery into a wider scene.
   * Aside from listed particulars, artist is welcome to add reasonable personal flair and flavor as they prefer. Or not, it is up to you.
   * From taking the initial logo ('lumberjack arm grasping burlesque fishnet leg in Epic Handshake Meme'), I'd like the image to continue outward to show a gruff lumberjack grasping his own fishnetted/tutu'd leg mid-skydive (or other activity) with friends.
      * The additional material of the banner would be friends of various excitement and 'good vibes' enjoying each other's company and cheering each other doing silly stuff. Like we all did as teenagers and younger when having fun with friends was just being silly and together.

  
If possible, the ideal thought to cross someone's mind when viewing would be ""these people are a little off, but the vibes are right.""

I hope I typed this up correctly and gave enough information for potential artists to have an idea of what the ask is.

Now we’re friends and I’m in too deep.,"I’m a girl in my late(ish) teens. Not an adult, and definitely not able to drink. Not in college. I live with my parents, as most minors tend to do. 

I know a guy named Josh. I can’t remember how old he is off the top of my head, but he’s definitely way older than me. 30s, 40s? He sits outside the pet store near my house some days with his dog, and one day I bought his dog a treat and then sat down to give him some cash and talk with him. We ended up talking for an hour or so, maybe more— he was super cool and genuine. At the end of it, he asked my name. I told him Matilda, which is not my real name. I figured I’d never see him again. 

Spoiler alert, I saw him again. Multiple times. And eventually I started seeking him out, driving by just to see if he was there so I could get him a coffee and we could chat. He’s never been creepy to me in the slightest, never touched me or even looked at me weird, never pushed for any information. I gave him my phone number so we could coordinate him showing up to my work (I work at a bakery) so I could give him some free food. He’s a sweet guy who’s never really done anything wrong, just got the short straw. He loves his dog like family. 

As we talked, we started exchanging life details, and I ended up spinning another lie about being vaguely “in college”— using the plans I have for once I’m ACTUALLY in college, and no real specifics, but obviously I don’t know what being a college student is like and I don’t know if he can tell I’m bullshitting. At this point ignorance might be bliss. 

I saw him again today and we chatted real briefly. He asked if he was “allowed” to ask how old I was, and I ended up saying no and he respected it, didn’t even push at all, but it’s clear that he thinks I’m an adult. He invited me to make some money doing a side gig with him in exchange for driving him around, which I awkwardly declined. He just texted me saying we should hang out “away from [his] usual hobo spot”, made a joke about going fishing and seeing me reel in a fat salmon. I can’t. I don’t necessarily WANT to. I like helping this guy out where I can, I like chatting with him, but I DO NOT want to spend time with him outside of that! I don’t want to text like we’re friends!

I need to stress how not creepy this is. I look old as hell for my age. He has no reason to believe I’m lying. The only person who’s done anything wrong here is me, and I don’t know how to get out of this. ",3,1743834247.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.72,False

Context: I work remotely in Chennai and like switching up cafés to keep things fresh. Keeps my brain happy, and hey, the coffee scene here is underrated. Anyway, I have a solid rotation of spots—some popular, some low-key. I usually keep to myself, headphones in, minimal eye contact.

July 2024, Phoenix Mall Starbucks — packed, as usual. Only seat available is across from me. Guy asks if it’s free, I say sure. He sits, opens his laptop, gets to work. Fine. Totally normal. He seemed quiet, dressed like a Pinterest board (linen shirt, clean-cut, very  look), but I didn’t think too much of it. I noticed him noticing me, but whatever. I’m not paranoid.

Until a few weeks later.

Second sighting. I'm across the city at this quiet little café I like for deep focus days. It’s the kind of place you don’t run into people you’ve seen before—small, tucked away. Guess who walks in? Yep. Him. Same dude. Same laptop, same clothes (or vibe of clothes), same unspoken “I know you know” energy.

We didn’t talk, but I definitely clocked it. And for the first time, I felt... unsettled. Once? Coincidence. Twice? Hm.

Fast forward to this week. I grab lunch at Dou in Alwarpet. I’m mid-bite into mushroom lasagna, and who walks in like this is a scene from a terribly written Netflix rom-com? Yep. Linen Guy. Third café. Third month. Zero interaction.

This time, we made eye contact for a split second. He looked like he wanted to say something but didn’t. And honestly, that freaked me out more. Because now I’m not just dealing with a possible coincidence—I’m dealing with a pattern.

I got home, told a friend, and she sends me a Reddit post that might actually be him writing about me. Saying stuff like “maybe the universe is trying to tell me something” and “if you’re out there, girl-from-three-cafés…” etc.

I’m sorry, WHAT??

Like bro… no. I’m not a plot device in your indie-boy daydream. I’m just a girl who likes mushroom lasagna and decent Wi-Fi.

Anyway. I’m posting this here because:

1. I needed to vent.


2. I needed to confirm I’m not overreacting.


3. And I needed to say this: If you’re reading this and it’s you—please stop. This isn’t fate. This is just… weird. Say hi or don’t, but don’t keep showing up like you’re being directed by Wes Anderson.



That’s it. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

## Diving Deep: Features and Performance

Now, let’s examine the features that made the Bose QuietComfort 20i stand out and evaluate their performance in 2025.

### Noise Cancellation: Still Top-Tier?

The cornerstone of the Bose QuietComfort 20i's appeal is, undoubtedly, their noise cancellation. While newer models boast advanced algorithms and chipsets, the QC20i's noise cancelling capabilities remain impressively effective. They excel at suppressing low-frequency sounds like engine rumble and ambient hum, creating a noticeable reduction in perceived noise. While they might not entirely eliminate higher-frequency sounds like sharp voices, they considerably dampen them, making the overall environment much quieter and more manageable which makes them arguably the best noise cancelling earbuds still in certain scenarios.

In a world dominated by wireless earbuds and Bluetooth technology, a wired connection can feel restrictive and inconvenient. The cord can get tangled, and it requires a headphone jack, which is increasingly absent on modern smartphones. This may negate their use for android devices and apple devices that no longer support wired connections.

### Battery Life: Required for Noise Cancellation

While the earbuds themselves don't require charging for audio playback, the noise cancellation functionality relies on a rechargeable battery housed in an inline module. This battery provides approximately 16 hours of noise cancellation on a single charge. While this is adequate for most users,it is crucial to remember to charge the module regularly. if the battery dies, the noise cancellation will cease to function.

The Bose QuietComfort 20i have been officially discontinued by bose.This means that finding new units may be challenging, and availability may be limited to online marketplaces or refurbished options. Securing parts for bose quietcomfort 20i repair can also become tough over time.
