The steel cash box containing the neutralized pen sat between us like a tombstone. ""He is a master artisan, but a minor player in the grand scheme. For him to make such a move against a place under the Accord's protection suggests he has a new, powerful patron. We need to know who.""

""And you can't just ask him?"" I asked, wiping down a coffee mug out of habit.

""An inquiry from my Court would send him scurrying into the deepest holes of the Feywild,"" she said. ""He would be a loose end, and his new patron would tie him off. No. We cannot use power. We must use precision."" Her obsidian eyes settled on me. ""We must use you.""

The proposition hung in the air. Me, a purveyor of coffee and calm, to become a spy. But I knew she was right. My neutrality was my greatest asset. I was a blank space in their magical world, and for the first time, I was being asked to weaponize it. This was no longer just about defending my shop. It was about preventing the next attack. ""What do you need me to do?""

Morwen described the Drowned Market. It was not a place on any map, hidden in the city's forgotten, flooded cisterns, accessible only through certain tide-locked sewer grates. A place where goblins traded stolen memories, where kelpies sold river-pearls that could drown a man in his sleep, and where artisans like Alastor peddled their wares.

My cover would be my truth. I was a purveyor of unique goods. I would go to the market to ""source new ingredients."" Morwen provided me with a guide, a quiet Unseelie named Finn whose features were so forgettable I had trouble recalling them even as I looked at him. He was not a bodyguard; he was a shadow.

Two nights later, Finn led me through a maze of damp service tunnels to a large, circular maintenance hatch. He turned the rusted wheel, and instead of the expected screech of metal, the hatch swung open with a silent sigh. The air that washed over us was cool and smelled of stone, moss, and something else… a faint, electric tang like ozone and old magic.

""Stay close,"" Finn whispered, his voice the first sound I’d heard him make. ""Don't eat anything. And never, ever, say thank you.""

I took a steadying breath and stepped through the portal. The coffee shop, with its warm lights and the scent of roasting beans, felt a world away. Before me stretched a cavernous space, lit by glowing lichen and the phosphorescent shimmer of strange fish swimming in the air itself. Stalls carved from petrified wood and old shipwrecks lined a waterway where silent, ghostly barges floated. The sound was a low hum of alien languages, the chime of unseen bells, and the constant, soft lapping of water. My quiet, mundane life was over. I was now in the Drowned Market.",1,1754183410.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False
1mg6hef,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_whypotato2123/comments/1mg6hef/whispers_steam_part_3/,Whispers & Steam Part 3,"The pen sat on my desk in the back office, a sliver of darkness that seemed to drink the light from the room. It was a problem beyond my expertise. Sir Kaelen would want to smash it with a blessed mace, an act that would likely feel like setting off a magical grenade inside a library. I needed an expert in a different kind of warfare. I needed someone who fought with whispers, not swords.

The next afternoon, when Lady Morwen took her usual secluded table, I approached not with her customary Earl Grey, but with a simple glass of water and the pen laid carefully on a clean napkin. I placed it on her table.

She didn't touch it. Her obsidian eyes narrowed, scanning the object from a distance. ""You were wise not to bring this to the attention of the Seelie,"" she said, her voice a low murmur. ""They mistake integrity for intelligence. They would have shattered it.""

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It is a weed,"" she explained, her gaze fixed on the faint sigil. ""A sympathetic anchor. It’s not a listening device; that is far too crude. This thing learns. It learns the unique resonance of this place, the calm, the neutrality, the mundanity that pacifies us all. And once it is attuned, it will begin to broadcast a discordant frequency, slowly poisoning the atmosphere. It would turn your coffee bitter, your chairs uncomfortable, and your patrons irritable. It would make this place feel... like everywhere else. And then the Accord would be meaningless.""

The threat was more profound than I had imagined. They weren't trying to break into my shop; they were trying to turn my fortress into just another room.

""How do I destroy it?"" I asked.

""You don't,"" Morwen stated flatly. ""Its destruction would release the energy it has already absorbed. A messy, noticeable violation. It cannot be destroyed magically here.""

My mind didn't turn to spells or ancient rituals. It turned to process. To rules. To the systems I had built that were, in their own way, as rigid as any Fae law.

I returned to the front counter and retrieved my ""Lost and Found"" ledger and a small, numbered plastic baggie. I noted the date, the item (""One (1) wooden pen""), and the location it was found. I then placed the pen in the baggie, sealed it, and dropped it into the heavy steel cash box where I kept the weekend's deposits. A mundane prison for a magical poison.

When I returned to her table, Morwen was looking at me with an expression I had never seen before: a flicker of genuine surprise.

""That,"" she said, a slow smile finally touching her eyes, ""is why you are the linchpin. You have entombed it in something no Fae can properly comprehend: bureaucracy.""

She tapped a perfectly manicured finger on the table. ""You have handled the what. This has allowed me to focus on the who. While you were busy with your... filing... I took the liberty of analyzing the pen's magical signature. It is faint, but arrogant. I know the artisan who crafted it.""

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""His name is Alastor of the Drowned Market. And he has just made himself a person of interest to my Court.""",1,1754183389.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False

So, there’s this girl, I’ll call her “E” for privacy. We’ve been seeing each other for a while now. I wouldn’t say we’re *official*. But, there’s definitely a connection. I know what that feels like. That spark, you know? It’s been there since the first time I saw her in line at the pharmacy. She laughed at something the cashier said, and I swear a fell for her then and there.

Anyway, lately she’s been acting different. Not cold, exactly. Just *weird*, like she’s worried about something 

She keeps looking over her shoulder when she’s walking, like someone’s following her. She holds her bag tighter, walks faster. She even started taking a different route to work.  I remember she’d always stop at the cafe for a morning coffee. Now she cuts through side streets or sometimes loops around through the park. I thought about talking to her that day but couldn’t find the words. 

She used to dress a certain way too, cute soft sweaters, long skirts. Lately it’s hoodies, baggy coats, sometimes even a hat pulled low. Like she’s trying to hide herself. From what though?

At first I thought maybe something happened at work. Or maybe an old ex showed up. I don’t know. But it’s like she doesn’t trust the world anymore.

We used to have these moments, nothing deep, but special moments where I felt we connected more. Like when she’d stop outside the bakery and look at the cakes through the window. I’d see her smile, and I’d smile too. I always remembered what kind she stared at the longest. She never knew I paid attention like that.

But now she barely pauses. Just walks the sidewalk between people, head down.

There’s been other stuff too. I think someone might be messing with her. She started double-locking her door, put up new curtains, got one of those doorbell cameras. I thought about knocking a few times just to check in, but… I don’t want it to come off the wrong way. 

I love her. I really do. I just want her to see that.

Anyway, that’s why I’m writing this. I don’t know if I should give her space, or try to talk to her. I don’t want to come off like I’m pressuring her or anything. But it’s hard not to feel shut out when someone you care about acts like you’re a complete stranger.

I just… I miss her. I miss how things used to be between us.

I brought her flowers tonight. I’m going to surprise her.

I know they say not to show up unannounced, but I think when she sees it’s me, when she sees how much I care, it’ll help her understand. She’s just confused right now. Scared. But I can fix that.

She should be home any minute now.

I’m being quiet, don’t worry. I’m writing this from my phone while I wait. It’s a little cramped under the bed, but I don’t mind. Over the last few nights I’ve gotten used to it. Being so close to her while she sleeps fills me with a sense of joy and protectiveness.

I hope she can see how much I love her.

I hope she doesn’t scream.

It survived three moves, including one halfway across the US, but it's started to finally wear out despite multiple descaling washes, breakdowns, and attempts to get it back to form. So suffice it to say, the time has come to replace it.

In addition, I have Moccamaster drip, moka pot, and French press. For espresso, I usually limit the milk I put in; think cortados, cappuccions, macchiatos, etc. Most of my drinks are 3 or 4 shots and I prefer medium-dark and dark roasts. (Not a fan of fruity notes in my coffee) I have a budget of around $1300 and was torn between a few choices:

1. Profitec Go. The go-to default for home single boiler machines. They seem to hold up well, look great, and apparently are extremely consistent. This would be great for espresso and steaming milk for moka pot and other drinks, or for my wife's tea lattes.

2. Lelit Vitoria. Slightly cheaper and more industrial looking than the Profitec. I've heard mixed things about their quality, though.

3. Flair 58 and a separate steamer. Disconnected analog, baby! While the previous two have the steamer and semi-automatic espresso capabilities, that's more to break and repair. This way if something goes wrong with one I'm not completely out of luck. Plus, they're much more simple and independent of each other. And cheaper than either option.

30f. i drive too fast, feel too much, love like it’s a sport i’m trying to win. i want someone who gets it. who doesn’t need small talk to feel close. who knows the difference between quiet and distance.

i look like i’d ruin your life, but i’m more likely to organize your glove box and pick up your favorite drink from the store. i want something that hums underneath — the kind of pull that makes you check your phone before it buzzes.

i’ve been the one who cared more. i’ve been the one that hurt someone else. this current version of me regrets both very much. but, id like to believe love not given is love wasted. i want eye contact that doesn’t flinch. hands that linger. someone who knows that silence can be intimate too.

I moved back to the US recently and some of my experiences with them/messaging has left an incredibly bizarre impression. I am also myself American. For example, lots of dramatic language used or an inability to be to the point/direct","There was one homeowner in particular who insisted upon meeting the day before to exchange keys (I am on another sit and could not be there any time before, I arrive back the same day) and though I'd be in town a few weeks before (as I'm traveling for the other sit), it was not sufficient. There's a level of neuroticism and a sense of dramatics to accompany stuff like this that makes me chuckle because it's so...unhinged? It's one thing to be anxious but it's another to be so completely off your rocker that you can't consider other options or possibilities. Like the lack of flexibility, very my way or the highway, and to boot, I find it patronizing when during these same calls with the type of HO I have in mind, they make snide and/or unnecessary comments about my personal life choices (it's happened twice now). The only other example of it being egregious which comes to mind is another homeowner wanting me to meet them for coffee at a location an hour away (I don't have a car, so video chat is the way to go. Otherwise I always offer to meet halfway between us). 

Of course, this hasn't been everyone - I've just noticed it a lot more than I'd find reasonable - between this, the flakiness, the ghosting - my experiences with Euro families in the US or Euro homeowners is not to this level of tomfoolery. I don't doubt it happens in other countries as well of course - ot is just something that I can't quite comprehend (I have lived abroad on and off for a few years). Oh! And on top of that, the same HO who decide it is not a fit for them for whatever capricious reason allude to offering or wanting sits in the future. Um, no, I'm not interested in a future date after this, and no need...it's so...artificial and superficial for them to idk, feel better? Keep options open? It's almost like they're afraid of being honest. What gives? Is it just the need/desire to save face? It may be reverse culture shock on my end again.

1mg6cse,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1mg6cse/vacation_itinerary_and_general_questions/,Vacation itinerary and general questions :),"Hello! My boyfriend and I are going to Singapore by the end of September and would like your local opinion on our drafted itinerary! We haven't touched this for months and now I'm kinda panicky about it since it's right around the corner.

It's not our first time there but it's our first trip abroad and it has been years since our families (separately) went.

I mainly want our vacation to feel like a vacation (not rushing things) esp when I have a tendency to forget what happens in trips afterwards when I'm too stressed during them. However, I also want to make sure it was worth the money because let's not lie here, SG is super expensive for us and our less-than-human salaries...We're mainly here for the Stardew Valley concert and just decided to make it a longer trip!

We’re skipping Sentosa as a whole because I feel like we won’t enjoy as much in USS/the new Oceanarium. :’(

Sorry for the long post! Also, anything with a * means it was recommended by a friend who lives there!

**Day 1 (Arrival by 6-7PM)**
- Check-in at hotel
- Dinner at McDonalds (PLEASE DON'T JUDGE I love McSpicy and they haven't brought it back to our country so I have to do it hahah)

Thinking if we should head to Mustafa after, but I think I will be overwhelmed and that we will miss public transport! Maybe we’ll just conk out unless you have other recos :)

**Day 2**
- Toast Box breakfast (just for today I promise)
- Haji Lane (I feel like I'll take forever here my sister went last June and said there were so many stickers and stuff)
- Kampong Glam
- Lunch at Singapore Zam Zam Restaurant*
- GBTB (Flower Dome + Cloud Forest)
- Merlion (i know 😞 )
- East Inspirations Shop* (souvenirs)
- Chinatown Hawkers for dinner (please reco!)
- Buddha Tooth Relic

For Kampong Glam, Merlion, and Buddha Tooth Relic, I really mean like, ""Okay take pics for 15 minutes or so and we're gone"", unless you have other suggestions!

**Day 3**
- Breakfast at Pinhole Coffee Bar (Should we go for Oriental Kopi* instead?)
- Suntec City Mall (Shop & Lunch—recos? 🙂)
- Dinner at Supreme Pork Chop Rice HAHAH
- Stardew Valley concert lol

The listed stuff are near our hotel and we kinda just wanna chill before our actual main event of the trip... unless you think we have other things we can do for this day...

**Day 4**
- Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya Toast
- Orchard Road (Shop & Lunch--any recos?)
- Bugis Junction (Souvenirs lol) + CHIJMES
- Dinner somewhere (Lou Shang*?)
- Nutmeg and Clove / Mama Diam*

CHIJMES is also a 'Okay few pics and we're good'. I hope there's no Smiski event near our trip dates because if I miss it I'll be pretty upset not gonna lie...

**Day 5**
- Grab a breakfast at 7-11 (Do you got recommended 7-11 food... hahah)
- Checkout early (Like 8AM early)
- Baggage drop at Changi T4
- Jewel (9:30AM-1PM); Do you have lunch recommendations?
- T2, T3 (1-3 PM)
- Back to T4 after 3PM 
- Flight at 6

I mainly just wanna go to the Pokémon Center,,, and do whatever attractions we can do in the airport terminals. Do we just eat breakfast at the airport instead of grabbing something from 7-11? How long does international immigration take, and are there still stalls/stores near the boarding gates in case we get hungry/thirsty?

//

**Other questions:**
- What's the weather like during the last week of September?
- If I bring a tumbler, where can I get refills... Like will it be okay to ask the restaurant? Would I get stink eyes if I fill it with service water from pitchers (if there are)?
- Thoughts on selfie stick use? My boyfriend bought one months ago but I'm not sure how you would feel about us using one... Not that it should matter a lot but we would like to be respectful!
- Any other things to note?

Sorry again for the long post, and thank you so much!

The Rules:

\-You have 10 Helldivers, represented by 10 different sets of armor. If they die in a mission, they are dead, and you cannot use that armor for the rest of the locke.

\-Drop on missions that contribute to the MO, and play on Super Helldive.

\-Record what planet you fight on, the mission type and the number of kills each helldiver accrues during their life.

\-Each Helldiver starts as a Cadet and ranks up for every completed mission, progressing through HD2's level progression. If they reach Super Private, give them a unique rank (like Free of Thought or Extra Judicial) and either retire them, or (still haven't come up with another option).

\-Record where the Helldiver dies and what killed each Helldiver.

\-If you have played at least one set of missions during each day of the MO and you still have at least one Helldiver alive when the MO ends, you have won the Hellocke.

1mg6bz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1mg6bz2/i_did_it/,I did it.,"I ""cheated"" on my serial cheater. For the first time in a long time. But I'm not young anymore. I think younger brains must compartmentalise easier.

It was amazing while it was happening. The come down is like... what the fuck have I become?

I used to be so proud of my morality and integrity and now it feels like a curse in this world.

I've realised most people don't value monogamy anymore. And if you do, you're the weirdo.

So I surrendered. A 20 year long friendship with a man who is just so fucking beautiful. Such a hard worker. Can bounce between subjects, can have banter and be disgusting and then also dive head first into things like philosophy or religion.

He makes no secret of not having a wife yet by choice. He doesn't hide his escapades that he does have. And he could truly have anyone imo. 

He's so focused on his immediate family, his parents, fitness and his business and it shows in his body, mind and bank account.

And for some weird, stupid reason, he's waited on me? He's been there through every heartbreak, he never even said a single cruel word about my husband in all those years. He just remained a steady constant motivator to me, reminding me of my worth. Never once crossing that line but reminding me he was waiting. We would laugh about it. And wait he did.

The logical part of my brain tells me this is love, this is real love. That sex we had belongs in the history books.

But I don't feel the magic, I only see it. 

All I feel is like shit. Like I've betrayed my husband. My poor broken little serial cheating emotionally abusive using husband.

So I guess when the world goes quiet it's times like this I realise how much his cheating truly broke me. How severely damaged my capacity to love is. How trauma bonded I am. And how I've been acting like a victim of him trapping me, 
when truly, I'm a prisoner to my own trauma.

And maybe it's deeper than just being cheated on. Maybe it's something that happened so early in my life that I can't even remember it. 

He returned this morning with his usual coffee. Smelling like another woman. In his usual cake eating cheer that used to translate as the perfect husband when really he's just filled his cup with validation, sex and the embarrassing thrill of sneaking around on a person who is none the wiser. It doesn't matter how old this routine is, and how many times I've proven myself right. He just repeats the cycle like a delusional broken record.

I wanted to tell him I slept with someone else, that this time it was different. That it was someone he knew. And someone he knows isn't scared of him or ashamed of me. Someone man enough to look him in the eyes and say, your loss buddy.

Instead, I took the coffee. I didn't have the heart to ruin his good mood. And I smiled at him as he skipped out to garden in the sunshine, calling out to me that it's a beautiful day.

I felt the grief of knowing none of my efforts, events, business building, child bearing, devotion, ever was enough to bring him the joy that cheating does. The grief of knowing he's an addict. That me walking away with our children and our life will leave him hopelessly alone in more ways than he could ever comprehend. Because no one would ever put up with his bullshit long term and he does not have the emotional bandwidth to build a whole new life with someone.

Then I screened a phone call from who is more than likely the love of my fucking life, and cried and cried.

So yeah... cheating went really well. Feeling cute, might continue doing it just to really fuck my brain sideways for good.",2,1754182906.0,adultery,2,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

The warning from Sir Kaelen lingered in the air like old smoke, a tension no amount of chamomile could fully erase. The patrons were wary, their conversations quieter, their glances toward the door more frequent. I focused on my own rituals, polishing the chrome on the espresso machine until it shone with a fierce, defiant gleam. Control the controllable.

The bell rang at ten in the morning, a flat, utilitarian clang. The man standing there wore no enchanted armor or silks; he wore a cheap suit and a lanyard with a laminated ID. He held a brand-new clipboard that seemed too stiff in his hands.

“Department of Health,” he announced to the room, his voice loud enough to make a pixie flinch. “Acting on an anonymous tip regarding… ‘unconventional food preparation’ and the use of ‘non-standard ingredients’.”

I saw Sir Kaelen, seated by the window, instinctively rest his hand on the hilt of his sword before realizing its utter futility. Across the room, Morwen slowly, deliberately, placed a bookmark in her leather-bound novel. This was not her battlefield. It was mine.

“Right this way,” I said, my voice even. I led him behind the counter, my movements calm and measured. “Here are my supplier invoices, food handling certifications, and the quarterly reports from the lab that tests my water pressure. The ‘non-standard ingredient’ is likely our primary coffee bean, sourced from a private estate on a volcanic island. Here’s the customs declaration and phytosanitary certificate.”

The inspector’s eyes widened slightly as I produced a thick binder of immaculately organized paperwork. He spent the next hour testing the temperature of the milk fridge, swabbing surfaces for residue, and checking expiration dates with a ferocity that bordered on desperation. He found nothing. Every rule was followed to the letter. My business was a fortress of mundane legality.

Flustered, he finally clicked his pen and signed off on the compliance form. “Everything appears to be in order,” he said through gritted teeth. As he turned to leave, his pen slipped from his fingers, clattering onto the floor. “Apologies,” he mumbled, scooping it up hastily before striding out the door.

It was only later, as I was wiping down the counter after closing, that I saw it. He hadn’t picked up his pen. He had picked up a decoy from his pocket and left the original. It lay half-hidden under the leg of the display case. I picked it up. It wasn’t plastic. It felt like cold, waterlogged wood, and etched into its side, so faint it was nearly invisible, was a sigil that looked like a drowning weed.

1mg69td,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1mg69td/misdiagnosed_with_ic_traditional_chinese_medicine/,Misdiagnosed with IC- Traditional chinese medicine resolved my issue,"Hey all—

I’d been struggling with IC-like symptoms since November 2023 and I have finally found a resolution. I understand this is an IC support group, but I know that there is a very high probability that someone in this group, like me, was misdiagnosed with it and could benefit from hearing my story. It’s been a very long journey with so so many tests and specialist visits. I met my deductible because of this (lol). my heart goes out to anyone who feels like they can’t bear any more conflicting diagnoses, medical bureaucracy, scary tests, or dismissive doctors. I have been there. ❤️

Here’s the order of my appointments and tests:

- urgent care- ureaplasma (treated twice for it with doxycycline; symptoms came right back)
- gynecologist - removed hormonal IUD
- first urologist
- general practitioner
- neurologist
- gyno / pelvic pain specialist
- second urologist/ IC specialist

At its worst my symptoms consisted of: Very painful urge to pee when waking up every morning, frequent trips to the bathroom, consistent painful urge to pee throughout the day after drinking any sort of beverage, gassiness/bloating on left side of my abdomen, and acute numbness (!) in my left foot that seemed to correspond to my bladder pain symptoms flaring up. I typically describe the quality of my pain symptoms as the feeling of a “low grade UTI”, or the sensation that a UTI was just beginning to develop.

I was initially diagnosed with IC by a urologist who explained to me that this was a diagnosis of exclusion based on my symptoms, and that I somewhat fit the demographic of patients he would commonly see with this illness (healthy, female young adults). He advised me to stay away from IC-triggering foods (strawberries, alcohol, coffee, etc.). 

To validate this diagnosis, I had a cystoscopy done (ouch). The imaging did not show any signs of scarring or inflammation in my bladder lining. The urologist then basically said to me, “congrats kid you don’t have IC, monitor this to see if it goes away.”

My reaction to this news was far from positive. I was at a loss for an explanation and considered this wishful thinking. At this point I had been suffering from *worsening* pain for over six months. It was beginning to seriously affect my work and personal life.

During this time I turned to herbal remedies for pain relief. I tried aloe pills (on advice of this group), willow bark tea (basically liquid aspirin), turmeric extract, and other herbal remedies. Overall they helped with pain management, but the effects were relatively mild. 

On the advice of my therapist, I went to see a gynecologist who specializes in pelvic pain- she was actually very empathetic and a great listener. I had to fill out a lengthy survey about my mental health, lifestyle, and medical history. She diagnosed me with IC yet again, which was frustrating and confusing for me. She stated I did not have pelvic floor dysfunction, and that my described symptoms were a “textbook case” of IC. She prescribed me physical therapy and amitriptyline. 

Then shortly after this, before I started any prescribed treatment, at work one day I drank some licorice and peppermint tea (shout out to teapigs). I was staying away from coffee and enjoyed the flavor of licorice. I began to notice that this tea helped to alleviate my pain symptoms more than anything else I’d tried. At home I experimented with drinking only peppermint tea and only licorice tea to isolate the effective ingredient for my symptoms. It was the licorice. 

Concurrently, I found the mental strength to see another urologist, someone who specializes in IC, who examined me and confirmed that I was likely not an IC patient. He also prescribed me amitriptyline. After taking it for a few days, I just could not get used to this medicine- it made me extremely drowsy to the point where I felt I was functioning at ~50% of my usual self. I stopped taking it because it was affecting my work.

After some online research, it finally clicked for me- licorice root is a very common herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. I grew up in a Chinese household where I had heard about it before. It has anti-inflammatory properties, among other uses. I immediately picked some up in Chinatown (dried, sliced licorice root) and started drinking licorice root tea daily- it continued to help alleviate my bladder pain! 

Given the apparent efficacy of this, I decided to see a TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) doctor. I wrote down a detailed history of all my symptoms, tests, and diagnoses. The TCM doctor explained to me this sort of imbalance cannot be detected by western medicine. She explained that in traditional Chinese medicine terms, my urinary system had cold air (energy)which was trapped and needed to be released, along with my body having excess heat which needed to be cooled. She prescribed me an herbal mix of 6-8 ingredients. After one week, I felt 50% healed. After two weeks, I would say I felt 80% healed. After three weeks, I was 90% healed. The TCM office also performed acupuncture on my left
foot with an electrical pulse, and after one session the numbness in my foot went away and hasn’t come back since. 

It’s been six months since I’ve had this herbal & acupuncture treatment. This week I am resuming the herbal medicine treatment to fully resolve the issue (I still get some painful urge to pee in the morning but it’s barely noticeable throughout the day). It was very expensive so I paused for many months- plus the pain had largely subsided on most days I barely noticed it. Alcohol is definitely a trigger though.

I am absolutely in awe of traditional Chinese medicine and its efficacy in my case. How I wish I had thought of trying it sooner. If any of you suspect you might be misdiagnosed or if you’re exhausted from navigating our cursed western medical system, I urge you to consider seeing a TCM specialist. Let this be the sign you need to take a chance and try something different. ❤️

Be well and good luck!

I really recommend reading the whole thing if you're interested in thriller type stories by copying and entering the link below and I'd appreciate any feedback or criticism.**

John woke up in the car disoriented. They’d hit a pothole, jolting downwards suddenly then plunging back up on the road. He did his best to recall the strange, vivid dream he was having while asleep. 

Pitch black, a fire roared almost as high as the faint trees surrounding it, and just above the tip of the flames hovered a body. Whose it was he couldn’t tell, but it was positioned in the same manner one would be in an autopsy. The body was stagnant and remained so throughout the dream, hovering just above the fire’s reach.       

    It was eerie. He didn’t really know what to make of it, but it was just a dream and he treated it as such. He stopped thinking about it and regained awareness of his surroundings. He was in the backseat being driven through some sort of forest, and he couldn’t remember the events leading up to him being in the car, but he remembered he had a job interview, presumably where he was headed. He looked at the back of the driver’s head, wearing all black from his hat to his shoes, and wanted to ask him some questions, but he stared out of his window instead, dejected, looking at the trees, bushes, ferns, logs, rocks, and dirt as they passed by, wondering what kind of work he’d be doing out here, and then they arrived at the cabin. 

“We’re here, sir.” The driver said, stopping the car. He got out and opened the trunk while John stared out his window, fixated on the cabin. It looked cozy, and had a small, round window in the attic above.

“Your luggage, sir.” The driver startled him by knocking on the glass. John got out of the car and was handed a black suitcase, after which the driver got back in his car and drove off. John watched him go on the narrow dirt path until he was out of sight, then he looked around at the forest he was left in, filled with trees so tall he had to look up to see their leaves, and it was silent, so much so that he thought he’d gone deaf until he heard his own footstep. It seemed boundless, yet somehow he felt like he was at the center. 

He saw a little white rabbit looking at him then scurrying off, reminding him of his daughter, memories accompanied by bittersweet melancholy, furthering his dejection. Having fully taken in his surroundings, he walked towards the cabin and knocked on the door. No answer. He knocked again then turned to face the road, and the door swished open, prompting him to look over his right shoulder at an older, bigger man with long, grey hair and beard standing inside. Although the man hadn’t said a word, John was slightly intimidated.

“You must be John,” he said in an English accent and with an inviting smile, “I’m Thomas. Please, come in.”

John went inside and looked around while Thomas shut the door behind him. The cabin was made entirely of beautiful cedar wood and was impressively furnished. To his left was an ordinary kitchen with a large window in the middle of it. To his right was the deceivingly spacious living room, complete with a small dining table, sofa, and a pair of large armchairs near the stone fireplace, along with a small coffee table between the two armchairs with the sofa behind them, all sitting on a decorative rug. The dining table was lined up with the edge of the narrow hallway leading to the bedrooms, with two wooden chairs on opposite sides. A bookshelf about waist high stretched across the wall to the right of the hallway, filled with books, and atop it rested a variety of trinkets and objects, including a metronome and a miniature seesaw-like object, equally balanced on both sides, and above the bookshelf a painting. 

“Sit.” Thomas said, walking over to sit down at the table himself. John sat down too.

“Alright,” he put on his glasses and grabbed some papers and a pen, “I’m gonna ask you some questions, just be concise with your answers, I don’t need to know each and every detail. Have you had any previous employment?” He asked sternly.

“Yes.” John said, sitting with his hands in his lap.

“What did you do and for how long?”

“I was a lumberjack, about 15 years or so.” He replied unenthusiastically.

“Good,” he checked and signed off on several pages, “You understand that this is a position of probationary employment, meaning temporary, with the chance of future permanent employment based on your performance, of which I will be the judge?”

“Yes.” He said, completely unaware. 

“You understand that you will be living here with me for the duration of your employment? All necessary accommodations will be provided, free of charge of course.”

“Yes.”

“You understand that I am to act as your mentor and superior throughout the duration of your employment, and you must therefore provide any assistance needed and complete any task given to you by me?”

“Yes.”   

“Now,” he reached across and handed the papers over along with the pen, “You must agree to the terms and conditions as well as acknowledge and accept all company policy and so on and so on. Sign at the bottom.”

John looked through the contract, which was quite dense and written in small font. “I have to read through this?”

“Technically yes, but nobody ever does.” Thomas said sincerely.

John signed without reading a word and handed the contract and pen back to him. 

“And that’s that over with. Congratulations John, you’re hired.” They both shook hands. 

“Come, I’ll give you a rundown of the basics and show you to your room.” He said whilst getting up and walking towards the hallway. John meant to follow him but was intrigued by the things on the bookshelf, and wanted to take a closer look. He moved across from the far end to the end closest to the hallway, where he glanced at the landscape painting hung above. 

“John?” Thomas called out from the hallway. He poked his head out around the corner and saw him standing by the painting, then he walked over. “What do you think?” He asked. 

“Huh?” John turned to him.

“The painting.”

“Oh, yeah, it's nice.” He said, trying to be polite. 

“What do you see?” Thomas asked inquisitively.

“Well I’m not much of an art guy.” 

“You have eyes, don’t you? What do you see?”  

“Some trees, plants, a deer drinking out of a river.” He said unenthusiastically. 

“I didn’t mean literally,” he was slightly disappointed, “how does it make you feel?” 

John looked at the painting shaking his head, trying to think of an answer he thought would satisfy him. “It feels… harmonious… like I want to be there.”

“Good, that was the intent.” 

“You painted this?” John was surprised. 

“Among many others, yes. Creating art is my greatest joy. I do mostly landscapes but also some portraits, although many of them don’t turn out to my liking. There’s just something about the face that’s difficult to get perfect…” They both stared at the painting quietly, “anyway, follow me.” They made their way into the hallway and stopped at a door on the right side.

“This leads to the attic where I stay, I lock the door every night so you don’t really need to worry, but you are under no circumstance allowed up here unless I say so.” 

John nodded, then looked to his left and saw a doorless room with nothing but a metal hatch on the floor, directly opposite to the attic door. “What’s that?” He asked. 

“The cellar, where I keep our supplies. Also off-limits. There’s nothing for you down there anyway… Come.” They continued down the hallway to another door where Thomas pulled out a large key ring that held numerous keys. He unlocked the door.

“And this is where you’ll stay.”

It was an ordinary room. There was a single bed on the left side and a small desk and chair opposite it on the right side, a small closet, a bathroom, and a small circular window, identical to the one in the attic, with curtains over it, the only other window in the cabin along with the other two. John opened the closet, and inside was a single white work shirt. 

“You’ll be wearing this for the time you’re here. You’ll work in it, eat in it, sleep in it if you want, and I’ve got only one so keep it clean. I’ll bring you a tub that you can wash it in with a sponge and some soap. When you run out just ask and I’ll bring more.”

“No pants?”

Thomas looked down at his pants, “the ones you have on are fine, just keep them clean,” he paused, “and you won’t be needing this,” he grabbed the suitcase and slid it under the bed out of sight. Now,” Thomas clapped his hands together, “I’ll give you some time to settle in and then you can get to work.”

“Now?” John said, surprised. 

“That’s why you’re here.” He closed the door and walked away.

John had a few minutes to himself and decided to check out the room. He went to the bathroom where there was a toilet and bath with a towel next to it, a toothbrush and toothpaste in a cup resting on the sink, and a small mirror in which only his head was visible. He walked over to the desk and opened the drawer, finding a journal inside with some pens and pencils. He took the journal out and put it on the desk along with a pencil, then walked over to the window, looking into the forest, a view not even Thomas had.

“John!” Thomas called out. 

“Coming!” he replied. He quickly changed into the white shirt and went with Thomas outside to the back of the cabin.

“Usually I’d have you clean the cabin first but I’ll cut you some slack today. The other main part of your job is to chop and prepare the wood I’ll gather for you each day.” They walked past a large, locked container and turned the corner where John saw a massive pile of wood chunks, dreading the tediousness and strain he knew he’d have to undertake.

“I expect it all to be chopped and carved to these specifications every day,” he handed John a paper detailing how it was to be done. “You’ll be out here for long hours so it won’t be easy, but it's not supposed to be. This is an opportunity for you to show me what you can do, so don’t waste it.” He handed John an axe and a carving tool then patted him on the shoulder. “Enjoy, and don’t come back inside until you’re done.” He left and went back inside.

    John stood there and closed his eyes hoping the work would be finished when he opened them. He sighed, walked over to the pile and laid out one of the pieces in front of him, then gripped the axe firmly with both hands and swung it over his head, splitting it in half. He did this over and over again until it was small enough to begin carving, and once that was done he laid the completed piece in a separate, neat pile. He grabbed another chunk and repeated this process over and over again until he finished around sunset. His arms felt like jelly, his back tight, his hands sore and blistered, his shoulders and wrists aching, his body covered in sweat. He was worn out and famished, but satisfied with his workmanship. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d worked so hard. He put down the axe and went back inside where he was immediately overwhelmed with a delicious smell coming from the dining table. Potatoes with gravy, cornbread, a whole roast chicken with some greens.

“Hungry?” Thomas asked, smiling. He brought over two glasses of water and sat down at the table. 

“Starving.” 

John rushed to take a bath then came back. 

“Bon appétit.” Thomas said. 

John immediately went for the chicken first and filled his plate up with some of everything, gorging his meal like a pig, which Thomas seemed to take issue with.

“Slow down and eat properly, the food’s not going anywhere.” He said to John. 

“You finished at the perfect time. It's getting dark,” Thomas continued. He took a sip of his water and was done eating. 

“You don’t go out at night?” John asked with a mouthful of food. 

“No, and neither will you.”

“Why not?” 

“Because I told you not to.” He said firmly.

“Well-” John looked across the table and saw his increasingly annoyed face. He stopped chewing and put down his fork, “I understand.” He said, trying to diffuse the tension. 

“My word alone should be reason enough, but I’ll explain this time,” his face changed back to normal, “I’ve seen tracks beyond the well, and you are not to go past the well either or you’ll get lost, night or day.”

“What kind of tracks?” John asked.

“Wolves, most likely.”

John resisted the urge to probe further and nodded in compliance.

“Finish your meal then wash the dishes,” He got up and put away the dishes, “I’m going upstairs. You’re welcome to read something off the shelf if you want, just don’t go-”

“Outside.” John interrupted.

“Good night, John.” He hung his keyring on a little hook mounted on the wall next to the fridge and went upstairs. John finished his meal and washed the dishes, then picked out a random book to read. He sat by the fireplace and read until he started to doze off, after which he went to his room, stopping to look at the cellar hatch on the way, and went to bed without his clothes, drifting off instantly. 

“Rise and shine. Breakfast is ready.” Thomas said, knocking on his door.

He woke up to the morning light peering through the curtains. He’d slept like a baby. He got out of bed and brushed his teeth then got changed and made his way to the table, where Thomas was sat with a notebook. 

“Morning.” Thomas said, his eyes glued to the pages.

“Morning.” He replied. There was a plate of scrambled eggs and sausage for him.

“Today will be your first full work day. You’ll be cleaning the cabin before you head out.”		 John sat down and began eating.

“There’s a mop, bucket, broom, and sponge,” he continued, “you’ll start by sweeping first, then scrubbing the walls, then mopping the floors. Wherever you can reach, you clean. Cleanliness is of utmost importance.”

“What about the empty room? Nothing to clean in there really.” John said.

Thomas looked at him, “the empty room as well,” He wrote something down. 

John was annoyed. It was a waste of time cleaning a room no one used, but he kept it to himself. 

“After you’re done you can go outside and work through the new pile.”

“And the one from yesterday?” 

“Gone. The truck came and picked it up already. It comes every day early in the morning,  but you don’t need to worry about that, I’ll handle it. Just focus on cleaning and preparing the wood.” He closed the notebook and took off his glasses, “I’ll be upstairs till dinner. You know what to do so don’t bother me.” He left and went upstairs, locking the door behind him.

John finished eating and put away his plate then grabbed the broom and swept through every nook and cranny, beginning at the front door, into the kitchen, then the living room, down the hallway, and his bedroom, saving the empty room for last. He stood at the doorless door frame, wondering if he could get away with not cleaning it, to which the answer was probably not, and so he swept the floor, avoiding the hatch. Once that was done, he scrubbed the walls and mopped the floors as meticulously he could, and finally he was finished. He walked around to make sure he hadn’t missed anything then went outside where a new pile waited for him in the same spot as before. He grabbed the axe and got to it, chopping and carving until sunset, before heading inside for what he looked forward to the most, dinner. Thomas had once again prepared quite the meal, chicken alfredo with garlic bread and some roasted vegetables. The smell that hit his nose was almost worth the labor alone. 

“Looks good?” Thomas said.

John smiled and nodded.

“Tastes even better.” He continued with confidence. 

John quickly took a bath and returned to the table. He waited for Thomas to get some first then went himself, and he made sure not to gorge on his food like he had yesterday. Thomas tried to engage in conversation, offering small words like stepping stones, but John wouldn’t pick them up. His eyes would drift, his answers were short- just enough to be polite, but not enough to connect. It had been like that since he first came. He could see him, feel whatever weight he was carrying, but couldn’t quite reach him. He finished his meal before John and sat by the fireplace with his notebook. John joined him shortly after. He moved his chair quite close to the fire, holding out his hands for warmth. 

“Careful, you might burn your hand.”

John moved his chair back level with Thomas’ and they sat there quietly.

“So, how do you feel?” Thomas asked, breaking the ice.

“About what?”

“Your new job.”

“It’s fine.” He said dispiritedly, the tone in which he always spoke. 

“You enjoy it?”

“I enjoy the food that comes at the end of it.” This he meant sincerely. 

Thomas chuckled, “I’m a good cook then?”

“I’ve been here two days and I’ve had the two best meals I’ve ever had in my life, you’re more than good.” 

“Cooking is as much of an art as painting. When you love something so much you can’t help but be good at it… What about you?,” he looked at John, “What’s your passion?”

“I don’t have one.” 

Thomas sighed. His answer saddened him. 

“There are those who never find their passion and stop looking, living the rest of their lives not knowing what could’ve been, and there are those who *do* find it—but never pursue it—living the rest of their lives in quiet desperation, *wondering* what could’ve been. *That* is life’s greatest tragedy.”

He turned to John, eyes steady, voice low.

“Don’t be the former, but more especially, don’t be the latter.”

His words resonated somewhat, enough to awaken a bit of vigor in him, something he hadn’t felt in as long as he could remember. Wise, but it would take more to lift him out from his depressive limbo.

“There must be something in your life that you love…”

“Two things.” John smiled for the first time to himself as images of his wife and daughter flashed in his head.

“A family?”

John was impressed with his ability to deduce.

“You must miss them very much.” Thomas said happily.

“I do.” A tear shed down his right eye.

“I’ll try not to keep you too long then. Give them my best wishes when you see them.” 

John wiped his eyes and his smile faded as the conversation lulled. He took a moment to think, staring at the fire, hesitant before speaking. 

“It was her 6th birthday. We all went out to eat at Bella’s that night, her favourite place. Their burgers were her favourite even though she could never finish them, always only ate half before she grabbed her belly and said she was full, but this time she ate the whole thing. I knew she’d get sick. It was too much food. Letting her eat it all was my first mistake. I carried her on the way home when she started feeling really sick. She kept asking when we’d be home every minute so we took a shortcut down an alley I sometimes took. It was usually empty, but there was a man this time on the other side. Halfway through the alley he started walking towards us. His hands were in his pockets and I thought for certain he’d rob us. My wife was scared. I was too. Uur daughter was asleep on my shoulder. We turned around to walk back, then I heard the click of a gun. He told us not to move. I told him we had no money, then he told us to turn around, and he wasn’t wearing a mask… My daughter woke up confused. He told me to put her down, then told her and my wife to get on their knees, facing me. He made me lie on my stomach with my hands behind my back. I tried comforting them as they cried on their knees, then I begged him. He let me finish, then he walked up behind my wife and shot her in the back of the head. He turned to my daughter who was screaming for her mom and shot her through the chest. Her little body collapsed onto the pavement but she was still alive, still fighting, gasping for air, a sound I’ll never forget. She tried crawling away with whatever she had left in her, then he shot her in the head and everything went silent. No more screaming…” 

The conversation lulled. 

“What were their names?” Thomas asked gently. 

“Lily, and little Ana.” He said with a smile.

“I lost a child too,” He said calmly, “a son. Years ago.” 

John looked at him, surprised.

“The police showed up one day and told me that he was dead, hit his head on the concrete after being struck with a bottle by some drunks who’d been harassing him on his way home.”

“What did you do?”

“I didn’t believe it at first, thought they’d made a mistake. The last thing he would’ve done was provoke someone, then I saw his body… I was angry for some time, hateful even. Something so pure and innocent, taken from me without reason. Out of everyone who might’ve walked past them they chose to target my son, for nothing. But thinking like that only made it worse, it didn’t change the fact that he was gone, which I had to accept, so I let him go. I cherish every moment we shared and there’ll never be a day where I don’t think of him, but I’ve moved on, and so should you,” He turned to John, “Since the day you arrived all I see when I look in your eyes is defeat. Their time was cut short, time they would’ve spent together with you, living full lives. What would they think if they looked into your eyes and saw what I see? Wasting the gift they were robbed of? Do you think that's what they’d want?” He leaned closer, “that feeling you get when you think of them, embrace it. It’s a manifestation of unexpressed love that no longer has anywhere to go. Don’t waste away dwelling on things beyond your control, if not for you, then for them.”

“Thank you.” John said sincerely. 

Thomas nodded, “I’m here, always.” He said reassuringly. He stood up and patted him on the shoulder, “I left you a tub of water and a sponge for when you need to wash your shirt. Good night, John.”

“Good night.”

Thomas hung his keys and went upstairs, while John stayed by the fire a little longer reflecting on Thomas’ outlook. He went to his room and washed his shirt, then walked over to the journal on the desk and opened it to the first page. He grabbed the pencil and sat down, writing “*Day 2*” at the top of the page, followed by “*Worked hard. Ate well. Feel okay.”* below it, marking his first journal entry, before going to bed.

I’m considering getting a metal filter to experiment with fuller-bodied coffee.

My question is:
Should I just get a standard metal filter, or is it worth getting the Fellow Prismo instead?
Would the Prismo offer any additional benefits beyond body and clarity?

I'm aware it's designed more for upright brewing, but I still prefer inverted. Just wondering if it's worth having both for versatility, or if a good metal filter alone will give me what I want.

Although the man hadn’t said a word, John was slightly intimidated.

“You must be John,” he said in an English accent and with an inviting smile, “I’m Thomas. Please, come in.”

John went inside and looked around while Thomas shut the door behind him. The cabin was made entirely of beautiful cedar wood and was impressively furnished. To his left was an ordinary kitchen with a large window in the middle of it. To his right was the deceivingly spacious living room, complete with a small dining table, sofa, and a pair of large armchairs near the stone fireplace, along with a small coffee table between the two armchairs with the sofa behind them, all sitting on a decorative rug. The dining table was lined up with the edge of the narrow hallway leading to the bedrooms, with two wooden chairs on opposite sides. A bookshelf about waist high stretched across the wall to the right of the hallway, filled with books, and atop it rested a variety of trinkets and objects, including a metronome and a miniature seesaw-like object, equally balanced on both sides, and above the bookshelf a painting. 

“Sit.” Thomas said, walking over to sit down at the table himself. John sat down too.

“Alright,” he put on his glasses and grabbed some papers and a pen, “I’m gonna ask you some questions, just be concise with your answers, I don’t need to know each and every detail. Have you had any previous employment?” He asked sternly.

“Yes.” John said, sitting with his hands in his lap.

“What did you do and for how long?”

“I was a lumberjack, about 15 years or so.” He replied unenthusiastically.

“Good,” he checked and signed off on several pages, “You understand that this is a position of probationary employment, meaning temporary, with the chance of future permanent employment based on your performance, of which I will be the judge?”

“Yes.” He said, completely unaware. 

“You understand that you will be living here with me for the duration of your employment? All necessary accommodations will be provided, free of charge of course.”

“Yes.”

“You understand that I am to act as your mentor and superior throughout the duration of your employment, and you must therefore provide any assistance needed and complete any task given to you by me?”

“Yes.”   

“Now,” he reached across and handed the papers over along with the pen, “You must agree to the terms and conditions as well as acknowledge and accept all company policy and so on and so on. Sign at the bottom.”

John looked through the contract, which was quite dense and written in small font. “I have to read through this?”

“Technically yes, but nobody ever does.” Thomas said sincerely.

John signed without reading a word and handed the contract and pen back to him. 

“And that’s that over with. Congratulations John, you’re hired.” They both shook hands. 

“Come, I’ll give you a rundown of the basics and show you to your room.” He said whilst getting up and walking towards the hallway. John meant to follow him but was intrigued by the things on the bookshelf, and wanted to take a closer look. He moved across from the far end to the end closest to the hallway, where he glanced at the landscape painting hung above. 

“John?” Thomas called out from the hallway. He poked his head out around the corner and saw him standing by the painting, then he walked over. “What do you think?” He asked. 

“Huh?” John turned to him.

“The painting.”

“Oh, yeah, it's nice.” He said, trying to be polite. 

“What do you see?” Thomas asked inquisitively.

“Well I’m not much of an art guy.” 

“You have eyes, don’t you? What do you see?”  

“Some trees, plants, a deer drinking out of a river.” He said unenthusiastically. 

“I didn’t mean literally,” he was slightly disappointed, “how does it make you feel?” 

John looked at the painting shaking his head, trying to think of an answer he thought would satisfy him. “It feels… harmonious… like I want to be there.”

“Good, that was the intent.” 

“You painted this?” John was surprised. 

“Among many others, yes. Creating art is my greatest joy. I do mostly landscapes but also some portraits, although many of them don’t turn out to my liking. There’s just something about the face that’s difficult to get perfect…” They both stared at the painting quietly, “anyway, follow me.” They made their way into the hallway and stopped at a door on the right side.

“This leads to the attic where I stay, I lock the door every night so you don’t really need to worry, but you are under no circumstance allowed up here unless I say so.” 

John nodded, then looked to his left and saw a doorless room with nothing but a metal hatch on the floor, directly opposite to the attic door. “What’s that?” He asked. 

“The cellar, where I keep our supplies. Also off-limits. There’s nothing for you down there anyway… Come.” They continued down the hallway to another door where Thomas pulled out a large key ring that held numerous keys. He unlocked the door.

“And this is where you’ll stay.”

It was an ordinary room. There was a single bed on the left side and a small desk and chair opposite it on the right side, a small closet, a bathroom, and a small circular window, identical to the one in the attic, with curtains over it, the only other window in the cabin along with the other two. John opened the closet, and inside was a single white work shirt. 

“You’ll be wearing this for the time you’re here. You’ll work in it, eat in it, sleep in it if you want, and I’ve got only one so keep it clean. I’ll bring you a tub that you can wash it in with a sponge and some soap. When you run out just ask and I’ll bring more.”

“No pants?”

Thomas looked down at his pants, “the ones you have on are fine, just keep them clean,” he paused, “and you won’t be needing this,” he grabbed the suitcase and slid it under the bed out of sight. Now,” Thomas clapped his hands together, “I’ll give you some time to settle in and then you can get to work.”

“Now?” John said, surprised. 

“That’s why you’re here.” He closed the door and walked away.

John had a few minutes to himself and decided to check out the room. He went to the bathroom where there was a toilet and bath with a towel next to it, a toothbrush and toothpaste in a cup resting on the sink, and a small mirror in which only his head was visible. He walked over to the desk and opened the drawer, finding a journal inside with some pens and pencils. He took the journal out and put it on the desk along with a pencil, then walked over to the window, looking into the forest, a view not even Thomas had.

“John!” Thomas called out. 

“Coming!” he replied. He quickly changed into the white shirt and went with Thomas outside to the back of the cabin.

“Usually I’d have you clean the cabin first but I’ll cut you some slack today. The other main part of your job is to chop and prepare the wood I’ll gather for you each day.” They walked past a large, locked container and turned the corner where John saw a massive pile of wood chunks, dreading the tediousness and strain he knew he’d have to undertake.

“I expect it all to be chopped and carved to these specifications every day,” he handed John a paper detailing how it was to be done. “You’ll be out here for long hours so it won’t be easy, but it's not supposed to be. This is an opportunity for you to show me what you can do, so don’t waste it.” He handed John an axe and a carving tool then patted him on the shoulder. “Enjoy, and don’t come back inside until you’re done.” He left and went back inside.

	John stood there and closed his eyes hoping the work would be finished when he opened them. He sighed, walked over to the pile and laid out one of the pieces in front of him, then gripped the axe firmly with both hands and swung it over his head, splitting it in half. He did this over and over again until it was small enough to begin carving, and once that was done he laid the completed piece in a separate, neat pile. He grabbed another chunk and repeated this process over and over again until he finished around sunset. His arms felt like jelly, his back tight, his hands sore and blistered, his shoulders and wrists aching, his body covered in sweat. He was worn out and famished, but satisfied with his workmanship. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d worked so hard. He put down the axe and went back inside where he was immediately overwhelmed with a delicious smell coming from the dining table. Potatoes with gravy, cornbread, a whole roast chicken with some greens.

“Hungry?” Thomas asked, smiling. He brought over two glasses of water and sat down at the table. 

“Starving.” 

John rushed to take a bath then came back. 

“Bon appétit.” Thomas said. 

John immediately went for the chicken first and filled his plate up with some of everything, gorging his meal like a pig, which Thomas seemed to take issue with.

“Slow down and eat properly, the food’s not going anywhere.” He said to John. 

“You finished at the perfect time. It's getting dark,” Thomas continued. He took a sip of his water and was done eating. 

“You don’t go out at night?” John asked with a mouthful of food. 

“No, and neither will you.”

“Why not?” 

“Because I told you not to.” He said firmly.

“Well-” John looked across the table and saw his increasingly annoyed face. He stopped chewing and put down his fork, “I understand.” He said, trying to diffuse the tension. 

“My word alone should be reason enough, but I’ll explain this time,” his face changed back to normal, “I’ve seen tracks beyond the well, and you are not to go past the well either or you’ll get lost, night or day.”

“What kind of tracks?” John asked.

“Wolves, most likely.”

John resisted the urge to probe further and nodded in compliance.

“Finish your meal then wash the dishes,” He got up and put away the dishes, “I’m going upstairs. You’re welcome to read something off the shelf if you want, just don’t go-”

“Outside.” John interrupted.

“Good night, John.” He hung his keyring on a little hook mounted on the wall next to the fridge and went upstairs. John finished his meal and washed the dishes, then picked out a random book to read. He sat by the fireplace and read until he started to doze off, after which he went to his room, stopping to look at the cellar hatch on the way, and went to bed without his clothes, drifting off instantly. 

“Rise and shine. Breakfast is ready.” Thomas said, knocking on his door.

He woke up to the morning light peering through the curtains. He’d slept like a baby. He got out of bed and brushed his teeth then got changed and made his way to the table, where Thomas was sat with a notebook. 

“Morning.” Thomas said, his eyes glued to the pages.

“Morning.” He replied. There was a plate of scrambled eggs and sausage for him.

“Today will be your first full work day. You’ll be cleaning the cabin before you head out.”		 John sat down and began eating.

“There’s a mop, bucket, broom, and sponge,” he continued, “you’ll start by sweeping first, then scrubbing the walls, then mopping the floors. Wherever you can reach, you clean. Cleanliness is of utmost importance.”

“What about the empty room? Nothing to clean in there really.” John said.

Thomas looked at him, “the empty room as well,” He wrote something down. 

John was annoyed. It was a waste of time cleaning a room no one used, but he kept it to himself. 

“After you’re done you can go outside and work through the new pile.”

“And the one from yesterday?” 

“Gone. The truck came and picked it up already. It comes every day early in the morning,  but you don’t need to worry about that, I’ll handle it. Just focus on cleaning and preparing the wood.” He closed the notebook and took off his glasses, “I’ll be upstairs till dinner. You know what to do so don’t bother me.” He left and went upstairs, locking the door behind him.

John finished eating and put away his plate then grabbed the broom and swept through every nook and cranny, beginning at the front door, into the kitchen, then the living room, down the hallway, and his bedroom, saving the empty room for last. He stood at the doorless door frame, wondering if he could get away with not cleaning it, to which the answer was probably not, and so he swept the floor, avoiding the hatch. Once that was done, he scrubbed the walls and mopped the floors as meticulously he could, and finally he was finished. He walked around to make sure he hadn’t missed anything then went outside where a new pile waited for him in the same spot as before. He grabbed the axe and got to it, chopping and carving until sunset, before heading inside for what he looked forward to the most, dinner. Thomas had once again prepared quite the meal, chicken alfredo with garlic bread and some roasted vegetables. The smell that hit his nose was almost worth the labor alone. 

“Looks good?” Thomas said.

John smiled and nodded.

“Tastes even better.” He continued with confidence. 

John quickly took a bath and returned to the table. He waited for Thomas to get some first then went himself, and he made sure not to gorge on his food like he had yesterday. Thomas tried to engage in conversation, offering small words like stepping stones, but John wouldn’t pick them up. His eyes would drift, his answers were short- just enough to be polite, but not enough to connect. It had been like that since he first came. He could see him, feel whatever weight he was carrying, but couldn’t quite reach him. He finished his meal before John and sat by the fireplace with his notebook. John joined him shortly after. He moved his chair quite close to the fire, holding out his hands for warmth. 

“Careful, you might burn your hand.”

John moved his chair back level with Thomas’ and they sat there quietly.

“So, how do you feel?” Thomas asked, breaking the ice.

“About what?”

“Your new job.”

“It’s fine.” He said dispiritedly, the tone in which he always spoke. 

“You enjoy it?”

“I enjoy the food that comes at the end of it.” This he meant sincerely. 

Thomas chuckled, “I’m a good cook then?”

“I’ve been here two days and I’ve had the two best meals I’ve ever had in my life, you’re more than good.” 

“Cooking is as much of an art as painting. When you love something so much you can’t help but be good at it… What about you?,” he looked at John, “What’s your passion?”

“I don’t have one.” 

Thomas sighed. His answer saddened him. 

“There are those who never find their passion and stop looking, living the rest of their lives not knowing what could’ve been, and there are those who *do* find it—but never pursue it—living the rest of their lives in quiet desperation, *wondering* what could’ve been. *That* is life’s greatest tragedy.”

He turned to John, eyes steady, voice low.

“Don’t be the former, but more especially, don’t be the latter.”

His words resonated somewhat, enough to awaken a bit of vigor in him, something he hadn’t felt in as long as he could remember. Wise, but it would take more to lift him out from his depressive limbo.

“There must be something in your life that you love…”

“Two things.” John smiled for the first time to himself as images of his wife and daughter flashed in his head.

“A family?”

John was impressed with his ability to deduce.

“You must miss them very much.” Thomas said happily.

“I do.” A tear shed down his right eye.

“I’ll try not to keep you too long then. Give them my best wishes when you see them.” 

John wiped his eyes and his smile faded as the conversation lulled. He took a moment to think, staring at the fire, hesitant before speaking. 

“It was her 6th birthday. We all went out to eat at Bella’s that night, her favourite place. Their burgers were her favourite even though she could never finish them, always only ate half before she grabbed her belly and said she was full, but this time she ate the whole thing. I knew she’d get sick. It was too much food. Letting her eat it all was my first mistake. I carried her on the way home when she started feeling really sick. She kept asking when we’d be home every minute so we took a shortcut down an alley I sometimes took. It was usually empty, but there was a man this time on the other side. Halfway through the alley he started walking towards us. His hands were in his pockets and I thought for certain he’d rob us. My wife was scared. I was too. Uur daughter was asleep on my shoulder. We turned around to walk back, then I heard the click of a gun. He told us not to move. I told him we had no money, then he told us to turn around, and he wasn’t wearing a mask… My daughter woke up confused. He told me to put her down, then told her and my wife to get on their knees, facing me. He made me lie on my stomach with my hands behind my back. I tried comforting them as they cried on their knees, then I begged him. He let me finish, then he walked up behind my wife and shot her in the back of the head. He turned to my daughter who was screaming for her mom and shot her through the chest. Her little body collapsed onto the pavement but she was still alive, still fighting, gasping for air, a sound I’ll never forget. She tried crawling away with whatever she had left in her, then he shot her in the head and everything went silent. No more screaming…” 

The conversation lulled. 

“What were their names?” Thomas asked gently. 

“Lily, and little Ana.” He said with a smile.

“I lost a child too,” He said calmly, “a son. Years ago.” 

John looked at him, surprised.

“The police showed up one day and told me that he was dead, hit his head on the concrete after being struck with a bottle by some drunks who’d been harassing him on his way home.”

“What did you do?”

“I didn’t believe it at first, thought they’d made a mistake. The last thing he would’ve done was provoke someone, then I saw his body… I was angry for some time, hateful even. Something so pure and innocent, taken from me without reason. Out of everyone who might’ve walked past them they chose to target my son, for nothing. But thinking like that only made it worse, it didn’t change the fact that he was gone, which I had to accept, so I let him go. I cherish every moment we shared and there’ll never be a day where I don’t think of him, but I’ve moved on, and so should you,” He turned to John, “Since the day you arrived all I see when I look in your eyes is defeat. Their time was cut short, time they would’ve spent together with you, living full lives. What would they think if they looked into your eyes and saw what I see? Wasting the gift they were robbed of? Do you think that's what they’d want?” He leaned closer, “that feeling you get when you think of them, embrace it. It’s a manifestation of unexpressed love that no longer has anywhere to go. Don’t waste away dwelling on things beyond your control, if not for you, then for them.”

“Thank you.” John said sincerely. 

Thomas nodded, “I’m here, always.” He said reassuringly. He stood up and patted him on the shoulder, “I left you a tub of water and a sponge for when you need to wash your shirt. Good night, John.”

“Good night.”

Thomas hung his keys and went upstairs, while John stayed by the fire a little longer reflecting on Thomas’ outlook. He went to his room and washed his shirt, then walked over to the journal on the desk and opened it to the first page. He grabbed the pencil and sat down, writing “*Day 2*” at the top of the page, followed by “*Worked hard. Ate well. Feel okay.”* below it, marking his first journal entry, before going to bed.

## Key Features Analysis

The best espresso martini kits offer more than just the basic ingredients. They provide tools, recipes, and high-quality components to ensure a consistent and delicious result every time.

**Premium Vodka Inclusion:** The best kits include a high-quality vodka, such as a brand known for its smoothness and clean taste.

Many kits provide a 750ml bottle of premium vodka. This isn't just any vodka; it's typically distilled multiple times and filtered to remove impurities, resulting in a smoother drinking experience. The difference is palpable in the final cocktail, as it lacks the harshness often associated with lower-quality spirits. This premium vodka complements the coffee flavors beautifully instead of overpowering them.

**Cold Brew Concentrate:** Ready-to-use, high-quality cold brew concentrate is crucial for a rich and flavorful espresso martini.

Kits aiming for convenience often provide cold brew concentrate bottles in sizes from 250ml to 500ml. Opting for concentrate versus requiring user-brewed espresso cuts down on time and mess. What sets the best concentrates apart is their low acidity and rich, chocolatey notes that play wonderfully with the other ingredients. Additionally, some kits may offer different roast options for the concentrate, such as a dark or medium roast, giving the user more control over the final flavor profile of the drink.

**Coffee Liqueur selection:** Offers a carefully selected coffee liqueur that complements the vodka and coffee.

A bottle of high-quality coffee liqueur, typically in the 500ml to 750ml range, is integral to the flavour profile of a great espresso martini kit. Top kits will source the coffee liqueur from well-respected brands like Kahlua or Tia Maria. Some kits have ventured into using small-batch or artisan coffee liqueurs, frequently enough infused with unique flavors like vanilla, caramel, or even chili, to add an exotic twist to the classic recipe. These liqueurs not only enhance the coffee complexity but also deliver important sweetness and texture to the cocktail.

**Bar Tools & Accessories:** This includes a shaker, strainer, jigger, and perhaps even martini glasses.

An adequately-stocked kit will include a cocktail shaker (usually 550ml to 750ml volume),a strainer (Hawthorne or Julep),and a jigger (typically 1oz/2oz measurements). more deluxe versions may also toss in bar spoons, muddlers, and even two martini glasses to complete the experience. The shaker’s quality is critical for chilling the drink effectively and creating the desired frothy head. Kits usually opt for stainless steel construction for longevity and hygiene.

**recipe Guide and Tips:** Providing step-by-step instructions and expert advice for crafting the perfect espresso martini.Beyond just including the ingredients, the best espresso martini kits feature professionally written recipe guides, often in the form of a booklet or card. These guides go beyond merely listing ingredient ratios and offer invaluable tips on shaking techniques, ice selection, and garnish ideas. The included information frequently contains variation suggestions and historical background on the cocktail itself.

## Core Benefits

The best espresso martini kits not only provide the necessary components but also elevate the entire experience of making and enjoying this iconic cocktail.

**Effortless Cocktail Creation:** save time and effort with pre-selected high-quality ingredients to make the perfect espresso martini without sourcing each component.

This is particularly attractive to beginners who find the world of cocktail ingredients daunting. No longer will you need to shop around different stores to find the perfect coffee liqueur or the best-suited espresso beans. The kits include everything you need measured to get you started efficiently. The ease of readiness allows even novice bartenders to craft professional-quality drinks with minimal fuss and time spent.

**Customizable Flavors:** Experiment with provided ingredients or add your personal touch for truly creative and unique variations.

some kits contain simple syrups infused with different flavors or allow you to modify coffee flavour intensity through varying ratios of concentrate. The joy of the espresso martini at its core lies in its adaptability.Many kits provide different garnish suggestions, from the standard coffee beans to chocolate shavings or citrus peels, allowing individuals to uniquely reflect their own tastes.

**Impress Your Guests:** Show off your mixology skills with a professional-looking cocktail kit that is sure to impress your guests.

The kits often come packaged in beautifully designed boxes, which makes them perfect for displaying on your bar cart or gifting to friends and family, further enhancing the ""wow"" or professional factor. Guests observing the use of such refined tools may also feel they are in better, capable hands compared to makeshift or clumsy arrangements elsewhere.

**Convenient and Cost-Effective:** Enjoy bar-quality espresso martinis at home while enjoying the convenience and cost savings.

Purchasing individual ingredients can be far more expensive and result in surplus that goes to waste. Espresso martini kits offer a much more cost-effective route for the consumer or the occasional user who does not wish to buy supplies in bulks that expire faster. By delivering everything you need conveniently in a package, it simplifies your mixing sessions as opposed to last-minute runs to the shops.

## FAQs Section

here are the answers to some of the most common questions about espresso martini kits.

**Can the kit be customized to cater to dietary restrictions?**
Some kits cater to different dietary needs.Most kits are naturally gluten free, but it's important to check the labels of any syrups or liqueurs. Sugar-free versions of coffee liqueur and syrups are increasingly available and might potentially be found in specific kits catering to the health-conscious.

**How long do the ingredients last?**
unopened vodka has a virtually indefinite shelf life, while coffee liqueur and cold brew concentrate should be consumed within 6-12 months of opening. If you notice any changes in the aroma, color, or texture of these items, it’s best to discard them.**Are there non-alcoholic espresso martini kits available?**
Yes, there are options for non-alcoholic espresso martinis. These kits typically replace the vodka with a non-alcoholic spirit choice and utilize alcohol-free coffee liqueurs or syrups. These are a great option for those who do not consume alcohol or want to enjoy the flavor of an espresso martini without the buzz.

**How do I clean the bar tools in the kit?**
Most bar tools, like shakers and strainers, are dishwasher safe. However, it's always preferable to hand-wash with soap and warm water, especially if the finish is fragile. Be sure to dry everything thoroughly after washing to prevent rust or water spots.

I just released the iOS app I've been quietly working on for a while - Water Tracker: AquaBee

I built this app because most water trackers out there felt either too basic or just didn't calculate hydration accurately. Some even show things like negative hydration, which isn't how our bodies work.

With AquaBee, I wanted to create something simple but smarter, using science backed hydration values (mainly based on Maughan 2016) so you can log any drink, water, tea, milk, juice, even coffee, and actually know how much it's helping you hydrate.

1mg607f,https://i.redd.it/eczxnrsgbpgf1.jpeg,"29 car haul. Not counting the five treasure hunts, I didn't get any treasure hunts.","I dropped my wife off with a friend at 6:30 this morning so they could drive to a mountain, hike up, and sleep on top of it. I decided to hunt all the places between the other side of town and my house.

The first stop is a Walmart open at 7:00. I hit the bare pegs with the beat-up cards, and right up front, there's a short card chill Mill treasure hunt in mint condition. Strangely odd.

Then I sit in the truck, eat the apple fritters I bought at Walmart, drink some coffee, and wait for the Dollar Tree to open at 8:00.

Long story longer, I end up in a Dollarama at 9ish, where there's an unopened case and a half a case sitting on the Shelf above the Hot Wheels. An employee is standing 20 ft away and says no problem and cuts the tape on the box.

My first virgin case, I'm so excited. No soup, but I got Mailed It Treasure Hunt. Long boring story longer, getting to the end of the day with few stops left, I get to another Dollarama where the girl brings out a fresh case. Oh my gosh, two in a day!

She got on a step ladder, set it on the step ladder platform, and opened it up. I handed her the cars while she hung them up high and medium. I carefully looked at each of them. I know what the past few years' treasure hunts all look like. There was no treasure hunt and no soup.

I have no idea how many places I stopped at today but it was quite a few. Wife's not home, remember? I probably saw 2,000 cars, maybe more, maybe less. And I saw so many cars that you all are dying to have I wish there was an easy way to help. 

TL;DR I got five treasure hunts and a bunch of other cars driving around all fucking day.",1,1754181918.0,HotWheels,0,1.0,False

**THE FINAL PUPIL - GAME INFORMATION**  
  
***THE SETTING:*** For whatever reason, your character is interested in new work—whether they were recently laid off, just starting out, or are looking to transition into a new field, they inevitably stumble upon the job posting above and find it intriguing enough to apply within. If clever enough, the decoded cipher will provide your character with an email which they may provide their application materials.  
  
The game is set in modern day London. The world you exist in is split between common normalcy separated by a supernatural veil which harbors an otherwise hidden world ruled by fringe science and cosmic phenomena. In the ""normal"" world, fantastical criminal networks, super-villains, and the heroes and geniuses which attempt to keep them in check, rule over a crumbling society; behind the veil, a wavering line of psychic impossibility, unexplained events, and mysterious creatures threaten to tow the line between ""*hidden""* and ""*here"".*  
  
***YOUR CHARACTER:*** Incredibly skilled, intelligent, desperate, has little to loose.  
  
***YOU:***

* Someone who is interested in a high-stakes, emotional game including violent themes and explicit content.
* Someone who is willing to delve deeply into their character creation and psyche.
* Someone who is interested in forming a community and friend group outside of in-character interactions.
* Someone who is an experienced writer, willing to match post length and quality, and post at least once daily (*previous MOTW experience not required*).
* Someone who thinks that out of character connections are just as important as in character connections.
* You are over 18 years old, preferably over 21.
* An ally or member of the LGBT+ community.



***THE DM/THE PLAYERS:*** My name is Lo! I am a DM (30, he/him) who has been playing TTRPG's for a little under a decade and writing for roughly two. This game is entirely home-brewed and, as it features my most favorite original character, is very dear to my heart. I am a lover of prose, and a hobby novelist who enjoys writing mostly dark themes or things that could be considered cosmic horror or psychological thrillers. As a Graduate student with a full-time job, my normal every-day-life is very busy, and I carve out particular times during the week and weekend to dedicate toward writing and my games because it is truly my favorite way to interact socially. I love yapping about characters and plot theory with fellow players, sending memes or just hanging out in voice chat. I would hope that anyone who applies to this game would enjoy those things as well!  
  
There are already two players who have entered the game, both of which are experienced in writing and TTRPG's and share similar sentiments surrounding character creation and out of character involvement.

We all have amazing partners inside the house, and although some people get on out nerves, we are able to keep things civil most of the time.  There's a other girl, Caitlyn (21F), who owns the house and regularly checks in on us and invites us to parties and such.  I love Caitlyn, mainly because she's my best friend's sister, and really nice to us.  But she shares an apartment with this creepy guy, ""Owen"", and sometimes he comes with her for the check ins.  Myself and two other girls steer clear of Owen, mainly because he has a MAJOR crush on us and does nothing to hide the fact that he wants to be a father.  Some of us come from really bad backgrounds, and he likes using that to blackmail us.  One guy, Spencer, is an orphan, and he witnessed his parents dying.  Owen doesn't know the full extent of it and just goes, ""So, Spencer, when are ya gonna invite Vivyanne (his gf) to meet your parents?  I heard Charlotte's (me) headed out to see Alexander's (my bf)."" Which aggrivates him so much.  I love Spencer, and I see him like a big brother, and, no, I was not meeting Mr. And Mrs. Wells.  So when I overheard, I came over and askes for a moment.  That's when he leaned in sexually.  ""Owen, I am taken.  Alex and I are thinking to the future. You cannot take me, Vivyanne, or Adelina."" I tried my best to stay strong.  ""Oh I know, EVERYTHING, Charlie."" I felt my knees go weak.  Only Paige and Caitlyn knew I liked the name Charlie.  I questioned why he called me that, and he answered simply.  ""I follow everything.  Caitlyn likes her coffee black, Paige can recite all the Fifty States in seconds, Vivyanne has OCD, Adelina has secret track meets on Wednesdays, everything, my Charlie."" I felt fear for the first time in years, so I punched him and ran to Alex.  He went to confront him, but he was gone.  I still feel uneasy about this.

1mg5wf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenpoint/comments/1mg5wf5/beware_of_greenburg_cafe/,Beware of Greenburg Cafe,"TL:DR at the bottom to simplify it

Writing here to expose those place for all the lying scum they've put me, my ex coworkers and the community through. 

Recently Greenburg on Franklin St opened up back in the beginning of the summer of this year, and I left my last job in February was searching for a new gig after my semester ended (im in Undergrad) and Greenburg called me for an interview, liked me and my experience and hired me in mid May and I left in early June. 

HOLY SH*T did I walk through the gates of hell. 

So first of all, in the month that I worked there, my own and my co-workers paychecks always had errors, we were never paid correctly for our hours and even on our pay stubs it was incorrect. My own check would say I worked just 12 hours for 2 weeks when in reality I worked for 26 hours (yes, I was clocked in for all my shifts). And the same thing happend to my coworkers as well, one of them was paid for $17/hour when she was promised $20/hour. Everytime we went to the owner (its owned by a couple, but the woman is the one thats incharge of daily operations) would give us the run-around and tell us workers, to personally contact the accountant, fully ignoring any and all responsibility and blaming the accountant. 50% of the time when you would contact those accountant she would either give you some lackluster excuse like ""I'll look  into it"" or ""Send me the correct hours you worked"" or the other 50% of the time she would just completely ignore you and not messages back. Wait, Hang on, get this. The accountant was in CALIFORNIA, so there was absolutely no way to physically go to her office and ask for her. So you're basically at their mercy for your unpaid wages and if you ask the owner about the accountant ignoring you, she'll eventually get irate and accuse you of being the bad person for asking you for your proper paycheck and that ""you need to stop bothering her and just wait"". 1 girl I worked with said the owners boyfriend (they're not married but have a kid) yelled at her over the phone when she called about her check and told her ""Its the accountants responsibility! Call her!"". Red Flag #1. 

Red Flag #2, The owner has absolutely no idea how to run a cafe, she admitted to us to our faces ""Yeah I have no idea how a cafe runs I barely drink coffee myself, so that's all on you guys"". So from the get-go there's no standards, no official rules, which explains why so many customers complain about their drinks being made wrong, because the workers have nothing to go by. You're pretty much set up for failure. When first hired we did a  1 day ""training"" at another roastery on Grand st if I remember correctly, but again there's no official rules in beverages in the actual cafe itself. 

Red Flag #3. Everything is Wildly overpriced, the same Matcha you can get at somewhere like MokaCafe or Sippy Cafe or Odd Fox cafe for $5 is like $6-$7 and its the exact same as those other places. They have a ""Triamisu"" latte/matcha. Thats like over $8. Its just a Mocha/chocolate matcha with whipped cream Thats it. Just add chocolate syrup to your latte or matcha and thats the ""Tiramisu"". Again, pretty much shelling out near $10 for something you can get somewhere else for $5. The Avocado toast is worse. I think the Greek toast is like $12 or $13? And its just basic country loaf bread with cream cheese, feta, onions and tomatoes and olives. Its about the size of a Roku TV remote, yeah again OVERPRICED. Don't waste your money, please just save it and go somewhere else. 

Finally, Red Flag #4. They hire and fire people like a revolving door. They'll hire someone, let them work for a few weeks then fire then for meaningless reasons. One of my coworkers got fired because they accused him of ""sweating too much"" (😑) that man barely sweated a drop so I have absolutely no clue what they were talking about. The guy I worked with that did food they fired him then rehired him and ""apologized"" saying they changed their minds. Don't be surprised if you go there regularly and see 1 barista for a few weeks then never see em again and there's a whole new team. And then next week there's a whole new team again. Ridiculous.

So basically as you can tell, this place is terrible, has no idea what in the world they're doing with their business. Screw over both employees and customers. I recently heard from my former manager that apparently the couple used to live in California and the woman apparently owns other businesses over there like a weed shop and a bunch of Airbnbs. She tried to open this place over there but couldn't so they moved to NYC to try their luck in Greenpoint since this neighborhood is becoming trendy. 

TL;DR Stay the hell away from this place. DO NOT apply for a job here if you're looking for a side gig/extra cash. DO NOT come here and waste your money on overpriced drinks that will be made incorrectly. Don't be fooled by the decor and how ""modern, minimalist"" it looks. The owners are scum and should be barred from opening up a business ever again.

digestive issues since I was a child. but nothing I realized wasn't normal. I used to rock back and forth in pain on the toliet when I was young and was told that sometimes its like that...yeah OK.

I have had internal prolapsing hemorrhoids for total of 8 years. the first 3 years the hems didn't prolapse all the time. It has consistently gotten worse every year. finally I started spraying blood out to the side of the toliet and on the wall and floor and decided it was time to get this taken care of.

I went to a gastro and got 2 internal hems banded and that fixed the inconvenient bleeding for about a year (still had regular bloods drops in toilet during BMs).

the bleeding came back and I went back to the gastro. I showed them a picture of the hemorrhoids prolapsed (after a BM) and they told me to go talk to the colorectal surgeon upstairs.

one month later I got the exam with the colorectal surgeon and she immediately opted for hemorrhoidectomy. she convinced me I would most likely be back to normal within a month.

One week later (7/31) I got the surgery.

Day 1: Surgery at 7am got home around Noon. Surgery was a piece of cake didnt really know anything happened, except now I had gauze taped in my ass. Was a little out of it from anesthesia. 

First feelings definitely uncomfortable and pain came and went but overall ok. felt like there was poop sitting on top of my butthole, mostly pressure. pain 2/10.

began right away cycling ibuprofen and acetaminophen every 2 hours.

and started nibbling on saltines just to put something in my stomach.

had a couple sessions on the toilet passing gas. weird sensation, I could tell this wouldn't be fun.

started taking colace every 4hrs? idk. 3 a day spread out.

Later in the night around 6pm I got aggressive chills, like violent chills. shaking chattering couldnt keep my body still. freezing cold.

Had a temperature of 97.8F. low. got cuddled into the couch and pushed through, spaced out maybe fell asleep.

7pm rechecked temperature: 101F.
7:30pm temperature: 101.2
8pm temperature: 100.7
9pm temperature: 100.1
11pm temperature was down to 99.4

slept mostly through the night. woke up one time and surgical area felt very warm and peeing was difficult. iced it. went back to sleep.

Day 2: Honestly nothing crazy. wasn't super hungry. couple eggs for breakfast. a few times on the toliet, mostly passing gas. after passing gas everytime pain was increased and either used the bidet for an extended period of time, took a shower with removable shower head or took a sitz bath (in the bath tub).

After passing gas and urinating the pressure was much less on top of my anus and the pain was minimal mostly. Just uncomfortable. felt like there was a rock shoved up into my butt. not fun but not terrible. pain maybe 3 or 4/10. mainly after passing gas.

still no BM.

drinking tons and tons of water. which im usually pretty good at i dont drink much of anything other than water and coffee.

had some more saltines, seedless grapes, some kefir.

took a dose of miralax during the day.

had some plain noodles with a little tomato sauce for dinner.

still taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and colace as scheduled.

Day 3: woke up at 3am to try and use the toliet. only passed gas it was uncomfortable and increased the pain so took a sitz bath. felt okay after that and then decided to take a prescribed tramadol because I thought maybe I would have a BM after I woke up again.

went back to bed and slept until 8am thanks to the tramadol. woke up and immediately tried to have a BM... nothing, more gas, more discomfort.

shower with the shower head to relieve some pain.

maybe reached a 4 out of 10 on pain.

then the rest of the day went pretty smoothly. Just gas pressure and trying to determine when to attempt another BM.

few more attempts. nothing. more gas. more discomfort but... getting harder to pee again. and now when I try to pee and my body reacts and activates my kegles (the stop peeing muscles) it feels like someone stabs me in the anus with a blunt stick.
 the shocks are probably 7/10 and sudden enough to make me audibly yelp and grunt. NOT FUN.

its 8:30pm and im eating bland chicken and butternut squash noodles. I will update you again when I can.

Today has been mostly just waiting around wondering if I would ever have a BM again.

When the light & hum dies down, we realize that the teleportation and fusing of the USS Kane and the Alien Bounty Ship has occurred....and we are caught in between it all.

There is some alien console and a few doors in this room, but nothing goes as you normally think it would. Certain doors end up coming right back into the room they started in. We vigorously test this by throwing a stress ball through doors.  
After an extensive doorway testing session, we end up going into several rooms and achieving nothing. At one point Johnny nearly goes insane trying to dick flick into a doorway that lead to a room with weird reaching hands. Yup, that happened.

Sexton uses a USS Kane console and pings us a map, with the plan of heading to the Armory, hopefully finding Marine Guard Johnson or Bill Chow on the way. We gear up and head out towards the Armory. Perfect solid plan. What could go wrong?!

On our way there through these doorways we end up in what looks like a jail cell alley.  
A mouthless, tall, pale, spindly humanoid Alien approaches the bars and tells us he can help us find out friends. Turns out, he can read minds and thoughts! And he wouldn't mind helping us, if we get him out of this cell. It's okay, he's a political prisoner! ***SHURE!***  
We flip him the finger (figuratively) and keep on treking towards the Armory. When we arrive, we find the room in all sorts of disarray. Parts are fused in and out and access to the weapons are behind this small crevice.  
Leave it to Sexton to roll up his sleeves and unsuit, to squeeze himself into this tight spot and get into the weapons room. Throwing anything and everything back to the crew, an alarm goes off on our watches and a bright light surrounds us yet again and we are transported back to the same room we showed up in.  
Seems we didn't go back to the USS Kane, we merely reset the sequence of events. Thankfully we're all back together, so we retrace our steps and this time; We head through the jail cell area, we see a humanoid man, alien, who isn't behind bars but he's non confrontive, named 'Number 3'. A nice change for once and guess what; He turns out to be helpful!

With the right questions, Number 3 tells us that if we can get him to the room where the artifact is, he can manage to stop all this.  
Using our ping map, we travel into the Alien Ship and end up by the crew quarters.  
Now, we're aware that there are three total bounty hunters; two which we need to stay away from and Number 3 tells us that Number 2 (The Boss) has a room right over there.  
So what do we do?!  
WE TRY TO OPEN THE DOOR....  
\*slaps head\*  
Except this door opens even before we can put our dicks back in our pants....

**LOOOOOOOOOOOK ALIVE! FORM A LINE!!!!**

These two large side doors actually rise up, rather than open and it's kinda at a slow pace, almost like it's made to build tension.  
We first see a set of boots, military boots then khaki military grade pants. It's not an alien! IT'S BILL CHOW!  
He is extremely scared and happy to see us.

We on the other hand have seen some shit. And we're not just gunna let Bill Chow, no matter how insignificant he is, derail us by turning out to be an alien and stabbing us in the back.  
So Dave Ryder picks Bill Chow's neck for some blood and then we give him a full out physical only to find out that....it's the real Bill Chow. (Ouuuf I hope the Medical bill isn't high for Chow Chow)

A few things; The room for number 2 is still open, so we can go there, or we can continue to the engine room. Also, Dave Ryder took too much blood from Bill Chow; so much that he has to put the excess back in a water pouch.

We continue on towards the engine room, going through several rooms. Not a lot of stuff in these room, nothing to pry us off our path atleast.  
Sexton looks at his watch; We only have a minute or two before everything gets reset again.

A loud hum begins and the bright light surrounds us, again and we're teleported back to the same room we started in. OH! And Number 3 isn't with us and neither is Bill Chow.

We gotta think quick here while we have time. Dave suggests sprinting to the room where Number 3 is and work from there.  
So cue the montage; we sprint to the first computer room to use the USS Kane's console, to ping us a new map, we sync watches for the next teleportation phase and we head to the room where we first met Number 3.

BUT HE'S NOT THERE WHEN WE ARRIVE..... hmpft.....  
All the prisoners we know are there, but not Number 3

All this fitness is all sixes and nines for Sam, who is out of breath from his overweight body doing all this running. Dave hands Sam his water pouch, which Sam begins gulping down unaware (doesn't care?) that it's Bill Chow's blood.

**Sam**, *roll Vigor check to see what effects if any happen from drinking all this blood*  
**4**  
***Sam burps up blood, but he's okay.***

We begin walking back and at the point there the two paths diverge, we run into Number 3!

We ask him if he can take us the the engine room (tick tock tick tock) but also asks if we would like to go and grab our friend as well. We all are kind of luke warm with Bill Chow, but I suppose we can go find him or like whatever...

Number 3 tells everyone to follow him and towards the engine room we go. We get to a large open room and Number 3 says Bill Chow should be around the corner.  
At that instant, a red laser tracks on Number 3 and rips a projectile in his shoulder. He falls to the ground, but does not register pain.

***---- COMBAT BEGINS ----***

*^(Situation Report)*

Number 3 is laying on the ground confused. A bunch of military scientists in Hazmat suits fill the room and booooooooy are they locked and loaded.  
6 guys come in, behind them and following, looks like an Alien and with his hands, looks like he's directing where the 6 military scientists go. OH SHIT! It's the escaped Alien bounty dude!!!! FAAAAAAAAAAKKK!!!!

**Number 3's turn**, *roll for shooting at one of the hazmat scientists*  
**4, ?**  
**Hit !**  


*Roll for dmg*  
**10**   
**HIT!**  
***Number 3's laser pistol shoots right into and through the hazmat head section, leaving a clean hole. Enemy down!!!***



^(5 scientists are left, they get a -1 for any rolls)

**Hazmat scientist #1's turn,** *roll to shoot at Commander Yuri with their normal pistols*  
**4, ?**  
**Hit !**  
*^(\*Steven doesn't factor the -1 roll into this roll, which would have missed Yuri)*

Roll for damage  
**7**  
**HIT !** *(Yuri's toughness is 5)*  
***Yuri takes a wound as the bullet dings into his shoulder, he now takes a -1 to every action he takes until he is healed***



**Hazmat scientist #2's turn,** *roll to shoot at Commander Yuri with their normal pistols*

Roll for dmg

**? , ?**   
**Miss !**

So Yuri is the only one to get shot at and eats shit for it, the others are lucky are start counting their blessings.

^(Matt in real life tells Steven that he's forgotten about the Bounty Alien's turn. Snitches get stitches yo...)

  
**Mind Control Alien Baddie's turn,** *He reaches out and asserts control over the scientists, removing their -1 debuff. He moves behind them and the group of hazmat scientists begin to close ranks, forming a tighter pack around the Alien.* 

  
**Dave Ryder's turn,** *Seeing Sam's grenade still there, pin not pulled, goes to reach for it to throw it at the pack of baddies (Roll d4 + d6, take the higher roll)*  
**4, 5,** *(Roll the max on a d4, roll again! add the roll)*  
**4,** (Rolled a 4, roll another d4 add em up!)  
**3**  
**11**  
**SUCCESS !**

*Roll for dmg (Roll 3 d6's)*  
**6 total dmg**

***Sexton*** *(who also failed his toughness roll)* ***is*** ***still sorta in the mix close to them, also take 6 dmg and takes a wound and is pushed back.***  
***The Mind Control Alien also takes a wound, giving him a total of two wounds.***



**Sexton Hardcastle's turn**, *Remember he as a pistol, pulls it out, taps it against his head but then aims it towards the alien once he clears the cobwebs away. (Roll shooting, d4 + 6d, with a -3 penalty because he's wounded and not proficient.)* 



^(Sidenote, Steven forgot about breaking the conditions of 'shaken' and 'wounds'. Therefor we recon that Yuri doesn't have two wound and Sexton doesn't incur a wound either.)   
^(Technically Yuri should have one wound (he was shot at twice with success) and Sexton should have the Shaken condition which means, Sexton should roll with a minus 1 penalty, Yuri with a -2; They have the ability to roll to break the Shaken condition. To make things easier, we wash it and say both characters are Shaken.)

Yuri, roll Vigor to break the Shaken condition (Roll d6 + d6, take the higher roll)  
  
  
**Sexton,**  *roll Vigor to break the Shaken condition (Roll d6 + d6, take the higher roll) Looking for a 4 to pass*  
**4, 3**  
**PASS!**  
***Sexton breaks his Shaken condition, he is now able to do all tasks***  


Now Able to use his gun properly, Sexton aims at a scientist *(Roll shooting, d4 + 6d, with a -2 take the higher roll)*  
**~~5, 1~~**  
**~~Fail~~**

Uses A binny, RE ROLL!!!

**?, 6** (Roll the max on a D6, re roll it and add it)  
**6** !  (Roll the max on a D6, re roll it and add it)  
**3**  
15 -2 = **13**  
*That's a raise!*  


Roll for dmg, *(roll 3 d6)*  
**?, 6, 6,** *(Re roll those sixes and add them together with the new rolls)*  
**17** total dmg

***Sexton aims and shoots right between the eyes, BOOM! HEAD SHOT! The scientist (with the laser pistol) drops like fourth period math. DONZO! ENEMY DOWN!!!***

*^(We have 4 scientists and the Alien left)*

It's the remaining scientists turn, 



**Hazmat scientist #1's turn,** *Roll to shoot with their normal pistols at Sexton*  
*4, ?*  
*HIT!*

Roll for dmg  
**11**  
**HIT !** and it's a raise. OUUF!  
Sexton takes on the shaken condition AND a wound. 





**Hazmat scientist #2's turn,** *Roll to shoot with their normal pistols at Sexton*  
*5, 4*  
*HIT!*

Roll for dmg  
**10**  
**HIT !** and it's ANOTHER raise. OUUF x2!  
***Sexton now has 3 wounds and looks like Rodney King. Meaning he'll roll with a -3 penalty on everything***

**4 , ?**   
**HIT !**

Roll for dmg

**Hazmat scientist #5 (Assault Rifle scientist) turn,** *Roll to shoot at Dave Ryder*  
**5, 3**  
**Hit !**

Roll for dmg  
**6**  
**MISS !** *(Dave's toughness is a 7)*

***The bullet grazes the wall and dings off Dave like a marble.***  


**Johnny the Swinger's turn,** *Roll to shoot at the Alien with his rifle, short burst (Roll a d4 + d6, +2 for all hit attempts and damage)*  
**?, 4**  
4+2 = **6**  
**HIT !**  


Roll for dmg *(2 d6 +2)*  
**5, 6** *(Re roll d6 add them up)*  
***6***  
***2***  
**21 total damage WOOWZA** *(That's 3 raises)*  


The Alien should have 2 wounds, one from Cory, one from Dave's hucking of the grenade

Johnny shoots the alien, hitting all 3 times, stomach, chest and head and the Alien drops to the ground, ENEMY DOWN!!

The remaining scientists have their mind control bond broken and come out of a daze. They are shocked and have their guns pointed at us.  
Before they have a time to react, we tell them that they have been under mind control and have been giving US a lot of trouble.

We take the two most charismatic of the party, Johnny and Sexton to broker a deal with these guys, who btw are looking down at their dead friends and dead alien, totally unaware of how they got here or what has happened.

So we explain ourselves

Everyone Roll charisma to convince these scientists with guns that we're the good guys.

**Sexton**, *(roll 2 d6's and take the higher roll)*  
**6,** (re roll d6 add the numbers for rolling the max)  
**4**  
**10**  
**Success !**  


**Johnny**, *(roll 2 d6's and take the higher roll)*  
**5 total**  
**Success !**  


**Dave** *(roll 1 d6 and take the higher roll to assist)*  
**2**  


**Yuri**, *(roll 1 d6 and take the higher roll to assist)*  
**4**   
***Success,*** *adds +1 to Johnny and Sexton's total combined roll*  


**Sam,** roll, *(roll 1 d6 and take the higher roll to assist)*   
**1**  


The scientists slowly come to, but their guards are still up. Number 3, who's still with us, is on the ground,  nearly ruins everything, asking if we should kill these guys. LOL Yuri manages to correct that. But he can't correct the broken ribs he got from taking the bullets.  
Speaking of fucked up, Sexton is bleeding from various places. 

We hostler our guns and show the proof of their mind control with the dead alien behind them. They are unphased, as they are aware of this Alien.

Dave goes over and heals Sexton and Yuri

**Dave Ryder**, *roll healing*, *(d10 + d6, +2)*  
**8, 5**  
**8 + 2 - 3 (***-3 because he takes a penalty for every wound there is)*  
**7** total  
***This means he heals one of Sexton's wounds.***   
***Sexton now had 2 total wounds***



Now we've been here fighting for about 10-15 mins. The engines were set to restart in 30 mins, leaving us with another 15 mins to spare.

We question the the scientist where the engine room is, but they are clueless. They are aware that the engines are going to reset and that they are stuck in a loop; When the engines restart they are gunna come to and get ambushed by the alien and be taken over. 

Things get tense between the groups and a shouting match breaks out. With both parties offended, the scientists shake their heads in disgust and begin to head on out, refusing to work or cooperate with us. 

Dave Ryder takes this opportunity to un holster his gun and shoot at the scientists  
  
**Dave,** roll for shooting on the scientists leaving the room with a -2  
**~~4, 3~~**   
**~~Miss !~~**

Uses a Binny, Re Roll !  
**13 total**  
**Hit !** *(It's also a raise)*

Roll for dmg  
**8**  
**HIT!**  
*Dave shoots the heck'er in the chest and he drops*

FYI they left to two scientists that we killed and their weapons; there is a laser gun and a pistol on the ground free for the taking.

The scientist turn around to the sound of the gun going off.  
One scientist watches his friend insta-dead and goes,  ""whhhhhat the fucccck!?""

**---- COMBAT RE-INITIATED ----**

^(there are 3 scientists left, two have assault rifles and other a pistol. Johnny picks up the laser rifle) 

**Sam Binge-eater's turn,** *rolls to use his vibro knife and stab the scientist in the neck. (Roll fighting d12 + d6, take the higher roll)*  
**10, 1**  
**HIT !**

Roll for dmg *(2d6 +1)*  
**11**  
**The knife goes directly into the side of the neck of the scientist. He's pretty much seeing the last life vibrate outta his head.**  
Sam, that fat fuck, grows a brain, or maybe it's just habit? But after stabbing the guy, realizes that he can just kick the soon to be dead scientist through the door, closing the door, which will prevent the two other scientists from coming in. Genius  


**Sam,** *roll a d20 to decide the outcome of what happens when you kick the scientist through the door.*  
**10**  
**Fail !**  
***While Sam does kick the scientist out the door, he fumbles with the control panel and now is just standing there in front of the door.***

**Yuri's turn**, *roll for shooting, full auto on the two remaining scientists \[**^(3 actions)**\]. Roll shooting d10, +d6, take the higher roll, with a -2 penalty for the full auto)*  
**7, 5**   
**HIT!**   
**6, 9** *(reroll that d6)*  
**3 (9** *total for that role***)**  
**HIT!**  
**3, 4**  
**MISS!**  


  
Roll dmg **(2d6 per person)**  
**4, 2**  
**6** *(it beats their toughness)*  
**HIT!**  


**6, 2** *(got a 6, re roll a d6 and add them together)*  
**5**  
**6+5+2 =**  
**13** *(it beats their toughness)*  
**HIT !** 

Both guards take holes in them, blood massively spooling from their gaping wounds.  
With his last breathe, the guard, in shock, watching his insides pour out, looks up at the crew and curses them...

>""***I'll see you in Heck!"" -*** *The Scientist on deaths door*

  
**---- COMBAT OVER ----**

With that said, Dave takes the time to head over to Yuri to finally get around to healing him.

**Dave Ryder,** *roll for healing*   
**21**  
**Success !**  
***He places healing goo on Yuri's bullet wound. Healing is a success.*** 



We have 25 mins left until the engines restart.

**Johnny the Swinger**, *roll for repair on Number 3 (Roll d12 + d6, take the higher roll)*  
**11**  
**Success!**   
***There isn't really any hard damage. He makes it aesthetically more pleasant*** 



We pause for a moment to debate on what to do next.  
But we should go for that engine room, right? Guys? GUYS!?!?

  
***WILL DAVE RYDER DOOM US ALL WITH HIS ANTICS?!***

***SOMEONE TELL SEXTON TO PUT HIS LIVER BACK IN HIS BODY!!***

***BILL CHOW WOULD HAVE NEVER SURVIVED THIS RIGHT?!***

1mg5sck,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mg5sck/update_i_miss_my_ex_boyfriend/,UPDATE - I miss my ex boyfriend,"It’s been two months since my first post, (not exactly two months, but we agreed to meet the first of August, so yesterday. Writing this now while I remember everything), which you can see on my profile, and three months since the break up (again, not exactly), and we’ve done the meet-up that I mentioned. Also, I’m fully moved out and living with my friend. I wanted to give an update in case anyone was curious

Before I get into how it went, I want to thank the comments on my first post. You didn’t let me get my hopes up about him staying in my life. I always would’ve understood if he didn’t want to, and I always would’ve respected his decision, even if it hurt. Instead of going in and it hurting more that he wouldn’t want to stay in my life after I hoped for it, I went in without an expectation. I didn’t assume the worst, but I tried to not have an expectation

We decided not to talk for about three months. I figured that was enough time for me to figure myself out fully and completely, and I needed to do that while not talking to him. Even if I came out of it not a lesbian, I don’t think we would’ve gotten back together. So the three months gave him time to start the healing process. Then at our meet-up, we would talk about how we found life without each other, and I would share if I figured myself out. That was always the plan - because he also said that he couldn’t see a life without me

Now, the update. The first thing I did was confirm my sexuality, that I’m a lesbian, and I apologized for stealing six years of his life, basically everything I said at the end of my last post. He surprised me with his response. He said that the six years weren’t a waste, that he didn’t regret a single moment of our time spent together. He said I was his best friend before, and I always was his best friend, that he didn’t just lose a girlfriend (I accidentally left out the fact that we were friends for about two years before getting together in my last post). He said that he always saw me as more than just his girlfriend, that I was my own person outside of being his girlfriend, and that I’m now a person outside of being his ex. He said that I helped him become the person he is, that I gave him a safe space to learn and grow. He said he wouldn’t trade the years for anything

I didn’t know what to say to that. I was just silent. As much as I didn’t want to go in with any expectations, I was still expecting him to resent me, and maybe he does and doesn’t want to tell me, but that meant more than I could imagine

He knows me well, so I think he knew I didn’t have a response, and he kept talking. He said that he did research on lesbians, on comphet, sexuality, all of it. He wanted to understand me, he said he didn’t want to be that guy who acted like a jerk just because he didn’t understand. He said he obviously wouldn’t understand fully, but he thinks he has a good grasp. I said that he didn’t have to do that, and he said that he wanted to be the best friend he could for me

After that discussion, I told him my revelations that he was my best friend, and just how important that was to me. Also listed in my previous post (sorry, just don’t want to repeat myself, haha). He said he came to that conclusion, too, but he does still have romantic feelings for me. He says he‘s not ready for me to be fully back in his life yet, which is completely understandable, and that he wants a few more months, or however long it takes, to keep going  with the healing process and to try to get over me. He said that if I’m down, we can meet up once a month for coffee or lunch, and slowly build on our friendship more and slowly bring each other back in our lives, as it wouldn’t be healthy to interact like we used to immediately, and I agreed

I don’t think there will be another update, so another thank you to the comments. Not sure how to end this post, haha, so this is the end

The WNBA’s most intriguing mismatch this week pits the **Phoenix Mercury** (-12, 1.14 implied probability) against the **Chicago Sky** (+12, 5.7 implied probability). Let’s break this down with the precision of a coach’s halftime speech and the humor of a解说员 who’s had one too many energy drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Phoenix Is the Favorite (But Not by Much)

The Mercury, despite their recent funk, are slight favorites. Their implied probability of winning sits around **52-53%** (depending on the bookmaker), while Chicago’s hovers near **15-17%**. The spread of **Phoenix -12** suggests the Sky need to keep this within a baker’s dozen for an upset. The total is set at **164.5-165.5 points**, meaning bettors expect a feast, not a famine.

But here’s the rub: Phoenix’s “funk” includes losing five of six games, with star forward **Satou Sabally** averaging just 10.4 PPG since returning from an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Chicago’s star guard **Rhyne Howard** is out with a knee injury, and the Sky’s recent efficiency? Let’s just say they shot like a team of blindfolded pythons against Golden State.

### News Digest: Injuries, Slumps, and a Coach’s Desperate Metaphors

**Phoenix Mercury**:

* **Satou Sabally** is the poster child for “injury comeback gone wrong.” After tripping through the ankle injury abyss, she’s scoring like a rookie on a coffee break—present but ineffective. Coach Nate Tibbetts benched her in the second half of a recent loss, calling the team’s play “a step slow” and their energy “a group of zombies at a yoga retreat.”
* The Mercury’s offense is a leaky faucet: frustrating, inconsistent, and best avoided after 10 PM.

**Chicago Sky**:

* **Rhyne Howard’s** absence is like asking a symphony to play Beethoven’s Fifth with a kazoo. The Sky’s offense just isn’t the same without their conductor.
* But here’s a plot twis

1mg5owt,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuba/comments/1mg5owt/first_time_travel_experience_to_cuba/,First time travel experience to Cuba,"Hi there,
I recently took a trip Cuba with 2 friends for 11 days. It is the most unique country I have ever been, and truly maybe the first time I've experienced culture shock in such a palpable way. I've traveled prior in Europe, India, Central America, and South America. 

I figured I would give some insight on my travel 
experience as a citizen of the USA. 
We travelled for 11 days this July. I speak conversational-ish Spanish (always working on it, take online classes each week) and 1 of my friends is fluent. This was incredibly helpful. The Cuban Spanish accent is beautiful and fast. When people slowed down I could understand.

To prepare we brought items for donations (feminine hygiene products, medicine, ect.) People you met on the street mostly asked for clothes, medicine, or soap. 
As folks from the USA our credit and debit card would not work there. We each brought way more cash than needed in case an emergency happened. I pulled out $2300 and spent about $900 of it. We were able to pay for our casas via air BNB prior to the trip.
I exchanged about $350 in pesos with my casa host for a better exchange rate than you would get ar a bank. We pretty much only used pesos at restaurants or to give to people in the street asking for money. We probably exchanged too many pesos and woind up donating them to a book store in Havana called Cuba Libre. 

Travels:
-We landed in Havana and spent only one night there before traveling to Playa Larga via taxi arranged by our host. Playa Larga was beautiful and fascinating. 
We went to a wildlife preserve and saw crabs everywhere in the trees ! In addition to fruit bats, a boa, a tarantula, and swimming in cenotes. My friends dive and were guided to a sunken ship while I snorkeled above them. The water was very clear and I could see them and the ship very well. The mosquitoes were poppin', spray is a must. 
**We experienced blackouts everyday here. Our casa host had a generator, but it only had enough power to run fans not AC.

-From Play Larga we traveled to the city of Trinidad. Times seem rough there, it is a beautiful city but they only had power about 2 hours in the day and 2 hours at night when I was there. 
More people on the street approached us for items than in Playa Larga. If I could do the trip again I would likely donate my items in a more thoughtful way. For example a very pushy man asked me for things and I only had feminine products on me at the time, which he seemed very happy to receive because he told me he had a wife...but again I am unsure if it will reach a woman. Sometimes I wonder if the more intense people asking for items on the street sell them on the black market 🤷‍♀️. Either way the need there is very sad.
In Trinidad we took 2 day trips. One to a beautiful beach and another up into the mountains to a coffee farm and waterfall. We were pretty much not able to access internet in Playa Larga and Trinidad. My friend had a sim, but access was spotty. 

-We then returned to Havana for 5 nights. We never experienced blackouts there. We stayed in Havana Vieja and Centro. 
These are touristy areas and getting approached ever few minutes is pretty intense. When we all spoke to each other in Spanish it seemed a bit less intense, but we are pretty obvious gringos either way. Lessons learned a little too late are *never follow anyone* and if someone asks you if it is your first time visiting say no. My friend responded to this question with a ""no"" on like the fourth day and the man just walked right away, no follow up. 
So scams abound, look them up (milk scam, let me show this great restaurant, etc). But you know what's incredible, is that Havana felt incredibly safe. And I think it is in terms of violence. So annoying scams, but felt very physically safe. 

The malecón in Havana is fucking magical. I can't really describe it. But I think watching sunsets there was the highlight of our time in Havana...went to the art museum and mailed a post card at a step back in time post office. 

There are large piles of trash on some streets. One local told me the government had stopped paying the people who collect the trash. 

Cuba is a beautiful place and the people are also beautiful and friendly. There is a lot of suffering going on and it is very sad to see. I don't really see how it's not going to all come to a head soon.

I'm not going to dive into politics, besides saying the lack of advertising was *fascinating*, and as soon as I sat down on the plane to return to the states I was very aware of being pelted by adds from the in flight entertainment.",3,1754180973.0,cuba,5,1.0,False

Let’s dive into this Chinese Super League showdown between Qingdao Hainiu FC and Dalian Yingbo, where the only thing clearer than the odds is the lack of news about these teams. Spoiler: There’s no scandal, no star players tripping over shoelaces, and no goalies with circus backgrounds. Just two teams, some numbers, and a bunch of puns about the sea.

**Parse the Odds: Who’s the Real “Sea” Winner?**  
The bookmakers have spoken, and Dalian Yingbo is the favorite to win this home clash. Their implied probability hovers around **53%** (based on decimal odds of \~1.91), while Qingdao Hainiu FC sits at **25%** (\~4.0 odds). The draw? A murky **22-27%**, which in soccer terms means “hope someone trips over a water bottle.”

The spread favors Dalian by -0.5 goals, meaning they’re expected to win outright. The total goals line is 2.5, with “Under” slightly more likely (implied \~53% chance). This suggests a tactical battle, not a fireworks show. If you’re betting on chaos, maybe check the weather forecast instead.

**Digest the News: Where’s the Drama?**  
Unfortunately, there’s no juicy news about injuries, transfers, or Qingdao’s forward secretly training with a dolphin. Both teams seem to be operating at full strength, which is either a blessing or a sign that the league’s PR team is taking a coffee break.

That said, Dalian Yingbo’s home record is their secret weapon. While we don’t have their recent stats, the fact that they’re favored here implies their home crowd is as loud as a group of fans trying to imitate a jet engine. Qingdao, meanwhile, is away from their nest, which in soccer means they’ll either rise like a seagull stealing chips or sink like a s

It's amazing watching them grow and learn so much every day. 

Which is to say, you parents in the newborn trenches are doing great and you have a TON to look forward to. This is 1000x easier than what you guys are going through, and there is a lot of amazing light at the end of your tunnels!

And, this is still really hard. I haven't gotten to a bad mental place in at least a month, but right now I'm really struggling to hold onto the joy.

- Daycare bugs are interminable. I've had a cough for six weeks. We just had to keep at least one baby out of daycare for a full week because of Hand Foot Mouth (thankfully relatively mild cases). I work from home, and even though my angel of a wife has been taking care of the kids, it's so draining to have screaming kids in the next room while I'm trying to get work done.

- Teething is rough. One kid is getting four teeth at the same time. Back to multiple nightly wake-ups...

- On top of just needing extra comfort from the above two points, we are in a very big ""hold me hold me"" phase. Constant melt downs if we aren't constantly holding one or both of them. And they are getting heavy...

- Mobility is becoming challenging. Diaper changes are battles of will. Going to grandparents' houses means an afternoon of wrestling two babies who are furious that I'm not letting them smash their faces into glass coffee tables. While we used to be able to leave them in our baby-proofed room for five minutes to take a breather or get some dishes done, not anymore. Back to the days of constant, active supervision.

- The messes... Dear fucking god, I had no idea I'd be cleaning the high chair, floors, bibs, and chair mats for 15 minutes per feed, 4 feedings per day, and STILL be cleaning bottles all day. So. Much. Fucking. Cleaning.

- Jealousy, toy stealing, pushing and shoving, attitudes in general are developing. They are still perfect little cherubs, just perfect little cherubs who know how to knock their sister over to get the one toy in the whole room that wasn't available in that moment.

It feels like a slight backslide in terms of difficulty and effort. The early days were insane (as we all know) and then it turned into hard and now we're back to crazy.

I’m 26, female, a recent psych grad, and currently attempting the brave (and mildly chaotic) act of making actual friends on the internet. 

Just a heads-up: I have a boyfriend, so I’m strictly looking for platonic, long-term friendships. If you’re someone who values deep convos, a little unhinged humor, and slow-burn connection, we’ll probably get along great.

I’m the kind of person who disappears for 3 days and then comes back with a novel, an apology, and a playlist.

Books: I’m a dark romance girly through and through. My bookshelf looks like it needs therapy. If the main character isn’t morally gray, emotionally unstable, or deeply in need of a hug (or a restraining order), I’m not interested. Bonus points if it makes me emotionally spiral in the best way.

Music: Music = everything. Mostly indie, alt, and rock, but I’ll listen to anything except jazz (no shade, I just can’t). Current obsession is Sleep Token, so if you have a song that feels like a punch to the soul, send it to me immediately.

TV Shows: I like my shows messy, dark, and emotionally damaging. Dexter, Criminal Minds, Shameless, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Supernatural… If it involves trauma, crime, or people making the worst possible decisions, I’ve probably binge-watched it at least twice.

Psych & True Crime: I majored in psychology because I was already overanalyzing everything anyway. I’m fascinated by the mind, especially the dark corners of it. Let’s psychoanalyze serial killers over coffee and call it bonding.

Spiritual Stuff: I’d call myself spiritual but not in a “love and light” way—more like “let’s pull a tarot card while overanalyzing our childhood wounds” kind of vibe.

Other facts for the curious:

• I bake like I’m trying to win a bake-off I wasn’t invited to
• Fluent in sarcasm and reaction gifs
• I’m deeply loyal, emotionally available, and fully prepared to be your emotional support cryptid
• Will absolutely send you a meme, a playlist, and a paragraph about why I relate to a fictional character

If you’re looking for a friendship that’s equal parts deep convos, dumb jokes, and emotional support (with space for disappearing and reappearing like a cryptid), feel free to message me or ask for my Discord.

A nerd in quite literally every sense of the word and unapologetically so. I’m the type of person who can lose hours in the grimdark lore of Warhammer 40k, debate the finer points of Star Wars vs. LOTR over coffee, or obsessively rewatch my favorite sci-fi or horror films while quoting lines like it’s a second language.

Gaming is a regular escape and music is my deepest love, the kind that makes you feel seen, like it’s narrating your life in the background. I’m fascinated by the cosmos, drawn to the deep, mysterious pull of the ocean, and always curious about the unexplored. Anime is another passion, equal parts comfort and inspiration.

I’m introspective, a bit sarcastic, weird in the best way, and always down for a meaningful or ridiculous conversation, whichever direction the energy flows.

What am I looking for?
Look, I can’t 3D print my perfect FWB (yet), but if a hypothetical gun was pointed my way, I’d say: someone curvy, nerdy, heavy emphasis on the nerd part. Someone with a sharp wit, emotional depth, and who knows how to actually carry a conversation without it feeling like pulling teeth.


Ideally, I’d love something that feels like a friendship with tension, where we can geek out, talk late into the night, make each other laugh, maybe share playlists… and let things evolve naturally into the other zone. Being able to enjoy each other’s company, fully clothed and not, is kind of the dream.

Other Stuff:
I’m based in the GMT timezone, which would make scheduling chats or hangouts easier, but honestly? It’s not a dealbreaker if you aren’t. Connection matters more than clocks.

1mg5gai,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1mg5gai/certified_introvert_seeking_longterm_platonic/,Certified Introvert™ Seeking Long-Term Platonic Vibes (26F),"Hi! I’m 26, female, a recent psych grad, and currently attempting the brave (and mildly chaotic) act of making actual friends on the internet. 

Just a heads-up: I have a boyfriend, so I’m strictly looking for platonic, long-term friendships. If you’re someone who values deep convos, a little unhinged humor, and slow-burn connection, we’ll probably get along great.

I’m the kind of person who disappears for 3 days and then comes back with a novel, an apology, and a playlist.

Books: I’m a dark romance girly through and through. My bookshelf looks like it needs therapy. If the main character isn’t morally gray, emotionally unstable, or deeply in need of a hug (or a restraining order), I’m not interested. Bonus points if it makes me emotionally spiral in the best way.

Music: Music = everything. Mostly indie, alt, and rock, but I’ll listen to anything except jazz (no shade, I just can’t). Current obsession is Sleep Token, so if you have a song that feels like a punch to the soul, send it to me immediately.

TV Shows: I like my shows messy, dark, and emotionally damaging. Dexter, Criminal Minds, Shameless, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Supernatural… If it involves trauma, crime, or people making the worst possible decisions, I’ve probably binge-watched it at least twice.

Psych & True Crime: I majored in psychology because I was already overanalyzing everything anyway. I’m fascinated by the mind, especially the dark corners of it. Let’s psychoanalyze serial killers over coffee and call it bonding.

Spiritual Stuff: I’d call myself spiritual but not in a “love and light” way—more like “let’s pull a tarot card while overanalyzing our childhood wounds” kind of vibe.

Other facts for the curious:

• I bake like I’m trying to win a bake-off I wasn’t invited to
• Fluent in sarcasm and reaction gifs
• I’m deeply loyal, emotionally available, and fully prepared to be your emotional support cryptid
• Will absolutely send you a meme, a playlist, and a paragraph about why I relate to a fictional character

If you’re looking for a friendship that’s equal parts deep convos, dumb jokes, and emotional support (with space for disappearing and reappearing like a cryptid), feel free to message me or ask for my Discord.

I’m hoping to get some insight into my tentative itinerary for my honeymoon between Dec 24- Jan 12th. Here is what I am thinking so far but would love some input from folks who have been to these places during this time of year. Specifically how the weather is, are things and attractions open? 

Lisbon, Portugal (first stop for 3-4 days)
Seville, Spain (second stop 3-4 days)
Granada, Spain (third stop 3-4 days)
Malaga, Spain (1-2 days)
Barcelona, Spain (3-4 days) 

I’m also thinking to possibly cut out Malaga and Barcelona to check out maybe Nice or Marseilles France? Or maybe do Italy for last 3-5 days of the trip. I know weather may not be super ideal so I am open to suggestions or if somewhere else may be ideal like Morocco considering they’re pretty close by.

**Material and Construction:** Most high-quality 20 oz cups are constructed from durable materials, typically stainless steel or BPA-free plastics. Stainless steel options frequently enough feature double-walled vacuum insulation, which provides superior temperature retention. BPA-free plastics are lighter and more affordable,while still offering durability and safety. The quality of the materials directly impacts the cup's longevity and ability to withstand daily use.

1mg5c6i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mg5c6i,Cozy Vanilla Cinnamon Milk Tea for Busy Evenings,"Not gonna lie, I usually fail pretty hard at making fancy drinks at home. My attempts to recreate coffee shop treats always end up tasting... off. But this week, I stumbled across a vanilla cinnamon milk tea recipe, and I figured, why not? At worst, it’d just be another kitchen flop to laugh about, right?

Complete Recipe : [https://www.amgroyal.com/vanilla-cinnamon-milk-tea/#tasty-recipes-18740-jump-target](https://www.amgroyal.com/vanilla-cinnamon-milk-tea/#tasty-recipes-18740-jump-target)

So I gave it a shot. All it took was black tea, milk (I used almond milk because that’s what we had), a little vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon. I added just a touch of honey to sweeten it. Let me tell you, the smell alone was magical—like a warm hug in a mug. And the taste? Even better. It’s got that perfect balance of coziness and sweetness with a little spicy kick from the cinnamon. Definitely feels like one of those cozy tea recipes you’d only expect at a fancy cafe.



My kids surprised me—they loved it too! They’re picky eaters, so I expected them to complain about the cinnamon, but they said it tasted like a “grown-up hot chocolate.” My husband’s been sneaking cups of it in the morning, which is wild because I usually can’t get him to drink anything but coffee. For once, the whole family actually likes the same thing. 



Oh, and here’s a tip I figured out: steep the tea a little longer than you think you need to. It really makes the flavor pop when you add the milk and cinnamon.



Anyone else struggle with getting their family to agree on one drink or snack? Also, if you’ve got other simple tea recipes for me to try, drop ‘em below—I feel like I’m on a roll here!

1mg5bcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mg5bcj/i_can_hear_the_song_of_the_carriage_lecher_pt_2/,I can hear the song of the Carriage Lecher -- Pt. 2,"It had been over two decades since I had been to Zion Holy Fire Assemblies of God, but I could never forget how to find it deep in the hills off highway 60. There was a new building now, across the road from the old one. They kept the Sunday school and the fellowship hall at the original location, and they held Sunday services in the new sanctuary.

Danielle had been shocked when I told her I was going to church, but I didn’t care. For once, she didn’t try to stop me from going somewhere. Even her mother seemed happy to help with childcare if it meant I was finding my faith again, and even if it meant my faith was a different denomination from the church Danielle normally attended with her family. 

But I wasn’t looking for faith. Not my own, anyway.

The parking lot was full. A couple kids played outside of the old building, chasing each other in and out of the overgrown peony bushes lining the wall. 

Since I was late for service, I stayed in my car and nervously drank the energy drink I’d picked up at the gas station. I had to piss, but I didn’t want to go inside. Not yet. I wasn’t here for service and didn’t want to get sucked into worship. 

I’d done my time in those crowds, pretending to raise my hands like the Holy Spirit had possessed my weary vessel. I had dutifully sung along to the same five contemporary songs with the same chord progression, week in and week out. I’d endured plenty of prayer lines and healings and seen my fair share of old women collapse on the ground, slain in the Spirit, as they called it. I’d passed out modesty cloths and helped cover those same old women so that their upturned skirts didn’t reveal their floral bloomers while they lay on the carpet. 

I wanted no part in all of that – the masturbatory public displays of holiness. I didn’t want the feigned celebrations and laying on of hands and murmuring of the regular members, the \*“God is good”\*s and \*“Praise Him in the mighty Name”\*s. But I did need to talk to Ol’ Son Roberts, named so because he was the son of… well, Daddy Roberts.

Son was a deacon of Zion Holy Fire, and he was the only clergyman I’d ever trusted. “Clergyman,” to be fair, was a bit of a stretch and not a fully adequate description. He was a kind man, real and rough as horse hide. He lived on a generations-old goat farm, ran a cash-only body shop out of his shed, and worked evenings as an elementary school janitor. 

If there is a God, only Ol’ Son Roberts ever speaks to Him.

Worship and subsequent prayer tends to go long past the scheduled hour at Zion Holy Fire, and a certain type of person revels in that. For all of his patience and genuine faith, Son is not that type. Whoever was the preacher now, they were surely circling the sanctuary, microphone in hand, whacking teenage girls in the head with a Bible (a little too fervently) and spitting furiously into the faces of the prayer team to the sound of synthesized church organ. 

But Son, I knew, would have made his way out to the lobby for his third or fourth coffee of the morning, and he’d be there until it was time to lock up or carry baked goods over to the fellowship hall. 

I found him right where I always had, when I’d taken up drinking coffee with him just to have an excuse to dip out of worship. And like no time had passed since we last spoke, Ol’ Son Roberts simply grinned and handed me a styrofoam coffee cup from the folding table he was leaning against. He was even wearing the same plaid button-up, tucked into the same khakis, which in turn were tucked into the same cowboy boots he’d had on the last time I’d seen him.

“Well, mornin’ to you, Mr. Bledsoe,” he called out. His voice was raspy as ever, despite having given up smoking in 1987.

“Howdy, Son,” I replied. “How’s it going?” I winced at the fact that I could hear myself putting on an affectation of the mountain drawl of my youth.

“Heard you got yourself a young’in,” Son said, matter-of-factly. 

Family life gets around like that, in the holler. Getting married, making babies, getting throwed in the drunk tank, getting shot at for screwing your neighbor’s daughter in the drug store parking lot. Those kinds of things tend to make their rounds to every household by noon the previous Tuesday.

“Name’s Jericho,” I said.

“Good name. Boy, I suppose?”

I nodded. 

“You never know, these days,” Son said, grinning. I forced myself to grin back. “What brings you back into the Lord’s house, Heath?”

Just like that. No matter how meandering the conversation seemed to be, not much time was ever wasted. Clever bastards, these good old hill folk. “I was looking for you, actually,” I answered. 

“Oh?” he said, without so much as lifting an eyebrow. He sipped his coffee, and through the closed sanctuary doors echoed the sounds of women wailing in divine ecstasy and young worship leaders belting out their practiced praises and displays of shameless piety.

I paused for a minute, filling my cup with coffee and still needing to take a leak. “You have anywhere to be after service?” I asked.

Son pursed his lips and stroked his wiry goatee. “Naw, not today. What do you need, Heath?”

Behind the thick-rimmed spectacles that Son had worn for forty years, I could see the concern in his eyes. He’d been kind to me when my mom died, and I’d spent a whole summer on his couch after my senior year of high school. 

“Just prayer, I think.”

That seemed to surprise Son.

“What’s troubling you?”

I looked around, painfully aware of the young nursing mother seated on a bench nearby, babe in arms and breastfeeding blanket draped over one shoulder. I thought of Danielle and swallowed some building saliva. 

“Rather not say here,” I said. 

“Trouble with the missus?” 

I started at that, on edge as I was. That slight hesitation was all it took to confirm Son’s suspicions, and he simply leaned back and gulped down the dregs of his coffee. “Alright then,” he grunted, and he thumped his huge palm on my shoulder as he walked past me and continued out the door.

I followed, not knowing what else to do. At least someone seemed to have a plan. 

Son unlocked both doors of his old Dodge pickup, the same truck he’d had my whole life. I climbed into the passenger side, and Son was already starting her up and peeling out. I suddenly wished I’d taken my one opportunity to use the bathroom. 

“You’ve got a troubled look about you, boy,” he finally said as we pulled out onto the nearly empty highway a few minutes later. “What’s this about?”

There was no use beating around the bush with a man like this. I’d sought him out, hadn’t I?

“I’m being stalked by a demon, I think.” 

I studied the old chiseled face, but there was no perceptible reaction. That revelation was not a shock to him.

“And what’s that got to do with your wife?”

“I never said it had anything to do with her,” I said, defensive. 

“You ain’t have to,” Son said in return. 

I didn’t speak for a few minutes. I began to sweat and had to roll down the passenger window with a squeaky hand crank. My voice cracked when I even thought about making some kind of confession, but part of me hoped there might be relief in telling someone trustworthy about what I’d done, or what I feared I had done. 

I thought for a moment that Son was going to tell me something and give me an out, but he merely pulled into the gravel turnoff for a decrepit Civil War cemetery and turned off the truck. When I still couldn’t find the words, he got out, strolled over to an illegibly-weathered headstone, and took a seat. 

I gathered the courage to join him, looking over my shoulder the whole while and wondering if I’d begin hearing those dreadful tambourines any second. Only the Canadian Geese migrating overhead and the distant sound of tires on some far off road echoed through the still gravestones. 

I was about to burst with piss, but I sat down in the grass beside the old deacon, not wanting to look him in the eye.

“I’ll pray, but you got to tell her, Heath.”

I hung my head in my hands, and I wept. 

“Almighty Father,” Son began, “You let this boy know he has the strength.” I sobbed at that, as I hadn’t in many years. What strength? My wife had no respect for me, and why should she? I was worthless, and had invited calamity upon our household, so it seemed. For all the hard lessons life had dealt me, I had failed to learn anything. “Give him guidance, Jesus, to follow Your will and find his way back to what he needs to be doing.”

Son continued to pray under his breath for a minute or so, rubbing my back like I imagined a loving father would. Son had been a father, once. Shame he hadn’t been mine. For me, anyway. 

“I just want Jericho safe,” I pleaded. Son nodded. 

“You ain’t let nothin’ touch that baby,” Son told God. “I know you won’t.”

\*\*

Son and I parted ways before lunch. He went on to visit his niece and her many children, and I went on back home, where I belonged. I made promises to invite him up sometime, to reconnect, and he made assurances that I was always welcome back on that same couch I’d slept on as a teenager. 

But I did not do what was right. Danielle wanted more baby wipes and coffee and cereal and eggs from the store, and then there was the small bit of grass we had that needed mowing. Not a good time, I told myself. Maybe whatever was tickling my ears at odd hours would go away. Maybe I had imagined it all, and maybe a believing man like Ol’ Son Roberts could scare it off, if it was real and if God was real. 

It did not go away. It returned that night, and every night hence. But it did not, for what it was worth, return to Jericho’s room. The song simply played its merry and its treacherous melodies, its reminders to my soul that I was not alone and could never be. That I was not to have peace in my sleep or in my waking hours, either. 

The three-legged demon, or ghost, or interdimensional extraterrestrial, whatever I could imagine it to be, did not return for some time. There were a few instances in which I thought I could smell a faint electric burning in the air, that foul ozone on my clothes or lingering in my wake as I went about my days, but there was nothing else tangible on Monday, or on Tuesday. Only the playful taunting of the song.

On Wednesday morning, I was finally able to see a psychiatrist in Knoxville who specialized in hallucinations and schizophrenia. She performed various screens and asked me about stressors, trauma, substance abuse – the usual suspects. She indicated to me that I did not seem to be suffering from some delusional malady. Her tentative diagnosis was that the music I was supposedly hearing was a stress-induced hallucination, or some potential neurological complication brought on by a lack of sleep with the newborn in the home. 

I didn’t tell her about the three-legged creature or its ozone breath. I didn’t tell her that I had begun to detect strange repeating rhythms in the song of the lute and the alien woodwind. I didn’t tell her that those patterns had begun to coalesce into something like an intelligible message. And I certainly didn’t tell her that the intelligible message seemed to be uncannily intimate, or that it wanted to speak to Danielle and Jericho.

The psychiatrist referred me to a neurologist and helped me set up an appointment for a CT scan, in case I was experiencing symptoms of a tumor or even a stroke.

When I returned to the familiar stomping grounds of our small, two-stoplight West Virginian town, I made a detour and stopped by the BitBar International office. 

Adding “International” to the incorporated name had been a deliberate, if grandiose, way to manifest the future success of our startup. We wanted to revolutionize liquor sales and distribution by fractionalizing digital ownership and leveraging cryptocurrency trading boards, or some other meaningless jargon like that. I barely remember. But we did have designs for real bottles that would act as physical tokens. Real altruistic, salt of the earth work we were doing.

I wasn’t stopping to work on BitBar app development, though. I wanted to finalize my CT scan appointment and see if I could figure out what was covered by my insurance, and I wanted to do so in peace without Danielle’s prying eyes or the expectation that I would be interrupted to help with Jericho every time anything at all happened. 

I had not intended to hook up with Maria. I didn’t tell her I would be there, and had hardly even texted her at all this whole week. It was just serendipitous, really, that she arrived half an hour after I did. Maybe she saw me on the security feed she had on her phone and decided to come over, maybe not. 

But there she was, her keys jingling in the front door of the unit and her short gym shorts riding up nearly to her pelvis, leaving not a whole lot to the imagination. Her black hair was in a ponytail and enough of her midriff was showing in the tight little top she wore to raise the dead. Dressed like she was about to go for a run. Damn, she looked good. I didn’t notice until later, but she had makeup on. 

“Where were you this morning?” she asked, and she walked right to the mini fridge beside where I was sitting at the conference table. She leaned over and got herself a water bottle, and I took in the view – which was, of course, the point of the whole exercise. At least, I flattered myself by assuming that it was.

“Doctor appointment,” I said. “Checkup,” I added, to dispel concerns. Last thing I wanted to do was go into detail about my affliction.

We didn’t tend to keep any regular hours. Maria had three other employees, but they were contract. I was the only salaried employee, and our understanding had included a loose and forgiving schedule. Like I said, startup. 

“I was hoping I’d see you this morning. Bailey and Norm are both out of town. I’ve been here all alone *all day*,” she said, adding a flair of exasperation to that last part.

She sat on the table and peered down at my laptop. That made it hard to concentrate. I switched to a tab related to my actual workload and pretended to adjust some numbers. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*.

I ignored the tambourines. 

“Did we ever get that credit back on our account with those server hosting people?” I asked, trying desperately to fight… what? What was I fighting, exactly?

Maria brushed past my mundane work questions. “I don’t know why I even dress up to come in here all alone,” she said.

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*. 

“I think you look just fine like that,” I countered, my head gesturing vaguely toward her body. 

The lute player tucked a string, or two or three. 

Maria’s eyes were honed in on my own. Her lower lip was just barely pouting, ever so slightly. Enough to override the devil’s flute whistling through whatever tied me to this conscious plane. 

“You didn’t talk to me much this week,” Maria said. She paused, waiting for me to pick up there. 

I didn’t know what to say. I could barely think over the escalating woodwind, the otherworldly gasping in and out, in and out. The song wallowed in the moment. 

“I wanted to,” I said, and I knew it sounded flimsy and pathetic. “Jericho’s had me up every night.”

Maria didn’t retreat or slow her advance. She leaned in, in fact. Her head tilted down so that her eyes seemed to be looking up at me, pleading. 

“Does Dani know?”

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka.* 

The lute and the woodwind rested, waiting for my answer. 

“No,” I said. I couldn’t force myself to look away from those eyes, those deep black wells of unfathomable mystery in which all but the bravest are lost.

Maria’s hand brushed mine. A probe, a dabbling in the waters to see if I was pulling back. I wasn’t. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka.*

“Are you going to tell her?” she asked. 

Her finger was warm and soft where it rested against my forearm. “Do you want me to?” I asked in return.

Maria’s pout protruded further, and she blinked, as though she hadn’t thought about that. I knew she had. 

“I figured maybe it wasn’t a good time. With the baby.”

“It’s not,” I said.

The woodwind whistled its low bass hum once, then twice, then thrice and thrice again.

Maria leaned in further, and I surprised her by reaching around to the back of her bare neck and pulling her face into mine. The surprise turned to surrender in an instant. Our lips met, then our tongues. Our eyes were closed in rapture as though witnessing our sin was a pleasure for which we were not yet deserving.

I heard – or felt, or sensed in some other way – the stomping of those infernal hooves, their spiraling approach to the forefront of my attention. Maria’s top was on the floor, my jeans were tossed on the back of a chair. 

I ignored the rattling of chains, the turning of wheels following just behind the three-legged footsteps. What other new instruments of torture would be added to my symphony? Lust overpowered any trepidation I might have had. 

We went on, as lovers do. Barriers came down, one step further and then another until there were few lines we had not crossed. All the while, the song played its gleeful tune, and the three-legged demon circled. And circled.

Until at last it stopped trodding, because it could come no closer.

The blistering steam of the spirit’s breath whipped over my neck and back, sizzled against my skin. I paid it little mind and kept on with my endeavor, fighting past the ozone smell of my anima writhing in electric pain. I was spite and I performed for an audience, daring it to watch me have my way.

I saw in my mind Dani, the joint smoldering in her hand as we stood across from each other in Austin’s basement. We were laughing at something nineteen-year-olds laugh at. I don’t recall what. I could only think about how pretty she was with those mouse-brown curls. The years I was in college and supported only by her waitressing. The summer I moved into her parents’ spare bedroom, and the afternoons when we would hurry and make out while her dad was mowing the lawn. Sitting on her bed and watching Breaking Bad together on the crackling CRTV. Going to the music festival in Philly and getting sick from food truck gyros. Our honeymoon in Maine… Dani. 

Maria and I heaved sighs of release and panted in the heavy stillness of a cold and silent conference room. My neck and back bristled in numb aching beneath the still-rising steam, as though the nerve endings of my skin had been cauterized. I made no move to get up from the conference table.

It should go without saying, but I have not been fair to Dani in this recounting of events. I have painted her in a poor light to justify my own misgivings. The color of my love must be wicked.

The song of the Carriage Lecher was silent, or off to taunt some other hapless moron. The chains, though, echoed somewhere in the distance. Had I remembered, even then in my ignorance, what that meant? Did I know the Lecher by name through some subconscious recollection?

Danielle would be at the house with Jericho now, alone. Her mother had been there all morning, but I had ignored a handful of texts updating me about their status. *“I need help with Jericho’s bath so I can get my hair done, Heath. Where are you?”* 

I grew weary of the upkeep of whatever semblance of marital duty I was pretending to maintain. 

\*\* 

When I later showered at home, I was not at all confused to see the markings on my back in the mirror where the three-legged specter had breathed upon me. The redness of my dead skin formed fractals of spiraling, repeating patterns, from the base of my spine to the nape of my neck. There was no feeling, there, wherever the markings touched. Only a faint pull, a tugging that had no effect on my mortal stride or my balance. It only served to orient me in some ethereal sense.

I became accustomed to early morning diaper changes and every other mundane task done to the tune of the damned fairy song. The chains and the clattering of the hooves sank into background noise, ever present, but never again going near my Jericho. 

Nor, it seemed, could I go near him. Oh sure enough I held him, rocked him, carried him around in a sling while I cooked and cleaned, but I was not present for those moments; could no longer remember seeing his smiles and or watch his bright blue eyes discovering the wonder of the world. I couldn’t hear the sounds of his babbling or his first laugh over the braying of the lute and the woodwind. Over the clatter of the tambourines.

Next Tuesday came, and my trip to Baltimore with Maria seemed a pointless venture. Still, I went, and I took some pleasure in the obscene carousing she and I got up to on the drive. We both got off a handful of times on the road through Virginia, and we made jokes about being pulled over and scrambling to zip up our pants before getting caught by the highway patrol.

Danielle texted a few times and even called once. Did she have an inclination of my treachery?

I can’t even tell you how our meeting with Gary’s investor buddy went, other than the fact that it was successful. Everything I did seemed to be successful, lately. Everything seemed to go my way. I charmed others, worked like a madman, tirelessly, over the sound of the song. 

Instead of the hotel bar, Maria and I went clubbing that night. That, I remember. 

I remember because I heard something familiar from the street. We had walked what seemed like most of the city – the part where you won’t likely get shot, anyway – hopping between one night spot and the next. We walked past Patterson Park and through Highlandtown, and then all at once it was like I woke up.

The lute and the woodwind had stopped. The tambourines hadn’t, or so I thought. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*. 

But that wasn’t a pair of tambourines. It was bass rumbling through the brick facade of a small venue off the main street, tucked away and obscured in the cul de sac of a repurposed industrial complex. 

*Sha Qi*, said the building, with its single purple backlit sign. Beside that were the Chinese characters transliterating the name.

I had already started for the entrance to the venue and was almost a block off the main boulevard by the time Maria caught up with me and asked where I was going. But I wasn’t listening to her. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*.

It was in the real world, that familiar rhythm. I felt it through my feet. It rumbled Baltimore.

The bouncer gave us no trouble, just a five dollar cover charge. It was not a popular club, by any means, and drew no substantial crowd. There was a fog machine running in the tenebrous purple lighting of the interior, and a handful of patrons stood around at their hightop cocktail tables and gently swayed with the beat. 

Maria was still struggling to catch up in her stilettos. I told her what to order for me at the bar so she would be occupied for a few moments, and she did as I asked with only a moment’s hesitation. 

I had seen what I was looking for: a DJ. 

There was no one in my way as I wound my way up the stage ramp and around the DJ booth to look the man in the eye. His oversized leather coat and the portable signage behind him read *Big Money OLAS: Our Lord and Savior.* 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*.

Big Money OLAS – I’ll call him OLAS for short – leaned back and folded his arms. He wore sunglasses, even in the near darkness of the *Sha Qi* interior, but I felt his eyes lock onto my own. 

“Is this music yours?” I asked over the bumping of the bass. It wasn’t long before a heavily modified flute melody began playing over the beat. Even in comparison to the woodwind it mimicked, the overproduced track felt crass.

“Course it’s mine,” he said. “Original.”

The song was not identical to the haunting one I heard nearly all hours of the day, now, but its flavor was there. Undeniably.

“Did you hear it somewhere?” I asked.

“You forget where you know it, huh?” OLAS continued to look me up and down for a moment, and then he turned back to his equipment and adjusted a fader. “When you start hearing it?” 

I paused, and swallowed a mouthful of unwelcome saliva. There was no reason to hold back. “I cheated on my wife.” I gestured back toward the bar without turning to look and see exactly where Maria was. “With that woman I’m with now. My boss.”

“Oh he gotcha good, huh?” OLAS didn’t laugh, but there was amusement in his voice. He lifted his sunglasses away from his eyes and tucked them into his hair so he could look at me better. “She a fine piece, at least?”

“*Who* got me?” I asked, my voice growing hoarse from shouting over OLAS’ bumping music. 

OLAS leaned in close, and I almost backed away but thought better of it. I had to hear what this guy had to say. “Where I’m from, we call him the Carriage Lecher,” OLAS said. For the first time, I caught a deep southern accent in his voice. As in, delta swamp, deep. 

“I don’t know who the hell that–” I grunted, and then I corrected myself. 

I heard the chains rattling behind me, just as they rattled behind the footsteps of a three-legged beast of burden. I felt the weight of the carriage tugging at us both, tugging through those taut chains. I had known, I realized, who it was that followed in a minstrel stagecoach. I recalled the smell of blackberry and vanilla in that plush red carriage. Or was that Maria I smelled?

I asked a better question. “Why me?”

“He calls you home,” OLAS growled, so gutturally that I first thought he might be choking. “You sealed a covenant long before you were spat out into that body.”

I stood still, as if in a trance, for a good several seconds. I had not consented to any such covenant. But maybe I had. The numb patch of marked skin on my back came to my mind, and I saw in that vision that the patterns spun like interlocking gears in a mephistophelian machine. 

“Is he a demon?” I finally asked. 

“Ain’t no angels. Ain’t no demons.” OLAS said. “Only us.”

I wasn’t sure what he meant. I must have looked bewildered, an expression exaggerated by the fact that I was already fairly tipsy and squinting through bleary eyes in the haze of the fog machine. 

“It’s who we always been, and will be.” With that, Big Money OLAS slapped my shoulder, forcefully enough to stagger me. There was something in it like the fatherly slap of Ol’ Son Roberts, but without the mirth. He pulled his shades back over his fresh-blacktop eyes and turned the volume dial on his control board up a few notches. 

A new track began to play on OLAS’ playlist, but I could no longer hear any music from the club’s sound system. I could only hear the lonely, nocturne lament of an other-worldly woodwind. Howling, then whistling, then shrieking in celebration of my remembrance.

*We knew you were not fit to father, Mr. Bledsoe,* it said to me with its lilting tune, and it laughed. *Our procession is no place for wife and child. Are you sure you don’t want to bring them with you?*",2,1754179868.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

For context I’m 23 male and neurodiverse (autism, ADHD, CPTSD, OCD and psychosis) never had a relationship, had friends but never had a friendship last more than a year. I’ve approached people to hang out and be friends and every time I’m always pushed away (I’ve been told it’s because I get super excited and nervous, and it can be overwhelming), so I just let people come up to me. There’s a girl who works in a shop, we have super friendly and flirty banter going between us for 7 months now and I want to ask her out for a coffee and hopefully date.

Anyway, asking someone out or even the idea of a relationship feels alien to me. Friendships, family, all of the entirety of human interaction I don’t understand how it works or what to exactly do or say. I hate putting on a performance, friends have pointed that out by telling me I’m being too serious or if I’m too distracted by something else. I don’t do the whole “I want to impress you” thing, seems fake and just not me.

 So, is it okay to ask someone out? Like is it a normal thing? I’ve only ever seen it in movies or on tv and never actually in person and don’t exactly know how people form relationships or even start dating.

## Key Features Analysis

The best ice cube chocolate candies in 2025 showcase several key features that contribute to their extraordinary quality and sensory appeal.

**High-Quality Chocolate Shell:**

The chocolate shell is the foundation of any great ice cube chocolate candy. The best brands utilize premium chocolate, typically dark or milk chocolate with a high cocoa butter content. This results in a smooth, glossy surface and a rich, decadent flavor that complements the cool center perfectly. A well-tempered chocolate shell will also have a satisfying snap when bitten into, adding to the overall textural experience.**Smooth and Refreshing Center:**

The defining characteristic of ice cube chocolate candy is its unique, cool center.This is often achieved through a combination of ingredients and techniques, such as using specific vegetable fats or adding a small amount of mint extract.The center should be incredibly smooth, almost liquid-like, and deliver a noticeable cooling sensation on the tongue.Some brands might incorporate natural cooling agents like erythritol for an enhanced effect.

**Optimal Melting Point:**

One of the trickiest aspects of crafting ice cube chocolate candy is achieving the right melting point for both the shell and the center. The shell should melt slowly and evenly to allow the flavors to develop fully, while the center should melt rapidly to create the signature ""ice cube"" sensation. Precise temperature control and careful ingredient selection are essential to achieving this delicate balance.**Elegant Packaging:**

Presentation matters, especially when it comes to gourmet chocolates. The best ice cube chocolate candies are often packaged in elegant boxes or tins that reflect the premium quality of the product. The packaging should not only be visually appealing but also functional, protecting the candies from damage and maintaining their optimal temperature and freshness. Individual wrapping of each piece is also a plus, preserving the texture and preventing sticking.

**Natural Ingredients:**

Consumers are increasingly seeking out products made with natural, high-quality ingredients. The top ice cube chocolate candy brands prioritize using real chocolate, natural flavorings, and sustainably sourced ingredients. Artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives are typically avoided in favor of more wholesome options that enhance the overall taste and experience.

**Variety of Flavors and Options:**

While the classic dark chocolate ice cube candy remains a popular choice, many brands now offer a wider range of flavors and options to cater to diverse preferences. Milk chocolate,white chocolate,and even flavored varieties (such as mint,hazelnut,or salted caramel) are becoming increasingly common.Some brands also offer sugar-free or vegan options to accommodate dietary restrictions.

Key features of the best ice cube chocolate candies include:

* premium chocolate shell
* Smooth, refreshing center
* Optimal melting point
* Elegant packaging
* Natural ingredients
* Variety of flavors

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Sensory Experience:** The unique combination of a rich chocolate shell and a cool, melting center provides a compelling sensory experience that is both refreshing and indulgent. This makes it a highly satisfying treat compared to standard chocolate bars. Biting into the candy and feeling the cool center melt on the tongue elicits a pleasurable sensation that can be truly uplifting.

**Stress Relief and Comfort:** Chocolate,in general,is known to have mood-boosting properties,and the added cooling effect of ice cube chocolate candy can further enhance this benefit. The act of savoring the smooth texture and refreshing taste can be a calming and comforting experience. Many people turn to ice cube chocolate candy as a small treat to help them unwind and de-stress after a long day.

**A Unique and Memorable Treat:** Ice cube chocolate candy stands out from other chocolate varieties due to its distinctive texture and flavor. It's a memorable treat that can be shared with friends and family or enjoyed as a personal indulgence. Offering a box of ice cube chocolate candies as a gift is a thoughtful and unique gesture that is sure to be appreciated.

**Suitable for Warmer Climates:** Unlike some chocolate varieties that can easily melt in warm weather, ice cube chocolate candy is designed to withstand higher temperatures relatively well, thanks to its carefully formulated center. This makes it an ideal treat to enjoy during the summer months or in warmer climates where other chocolates might become soft and messy. Keeping them slightly chilled enhances the cooling sensation.

**Pairs Well with Beverages:** The subtle sweetness and refreshing coolness of ice cube chocolate candy makes it a versatile pairing option for a variety of beverages. It complements coffee, tea, and even certain wines and spirits beautifully.

He opens his eyes and instead of soft, warm darkness, there’s cold air brushing scales. His vision is sharp,terrifyingly sharp. He can see the fine lines of stone in the cave wall, the shimmer of distant starlight outside, colors he’s never had names for.

He blinks, slowly, and his pupils contract into vertical slits.

*“Okay… no need to panic. Just… a really weird dream.”*

He tries to scratch his face,and hears the scrape of claws against scales. He lowers his gaze. Massive talons gleam black, curved like knives.

*“…Well shit.”*

Dominik tries to sit up, but his body is all wrong. His chest is huge, barrel-like. His spine arches, covered in a ridge of bony plates. A long tail, weighted with a spade-shaped tip, flicks behind him like a whip. Wings lie folded against his sides,huge sails of skin stretched between bony fingers.

He draws a breath,and it rumbles deep in a chest twice the size of his human torso. Smoke curls from his nostrils.

He laughs, but it comes out as a rumble that shakes gravel loose from the cave ceiling.

He crawls to the mouth of the cave and pokes his long snout into the night air.

Outside, the world is endless. A moon hangs low, enormous, dusting silver over pine forests and black mountain ridges. The stars blaze in colors he’s never seen. He can smell *everything*,sap from distant trees, the wet stone of the river far below, the icy scent of snow on peaks miles away.

Dominik spreads his wings cautiously. The membranes are leathery, veined like leaves, shimmering green and black.

*“Dragons fly. I’m a dragon now. So…I guess I fly.”*

He steps closer to the ledge. Rocks crumble under his talons. The wind rushes under his wings. His heart, alien and huge, thunders in his chest.

He jumps.

For a breathless instant, there’s only gravity dragging him down. Then his wings snap wide with a boom like thunder. Air surges beneath him, lifting him skyward. Wind roars in his ears. Trees blur below.

And Dominik is flying.

He laughs again,a deep, rolling sound that echoes off the mountains.

*“HOLY HELL. I’M A WYVERN.”*

He spins in midair, banking hard. Stars wheel around him like jewels.

Far below, a deer glances up, ears twitching. Then it bolts into the shadows.

Dominik soars higher, feeling the cold burn of the upper atmosphere. He flexes his talons, curls his tail. His wings slice through clouds like knives.

And even in the middle of joy, a thought cuts through him:

*“Okay. So… how the hell am I going to turn back? If i remember right the witch changed me for a year.”*

 

Dominik glides in lazy circles above the mountain peaks. Cold air rushes over his scales, under his wings. He’s trembling,not from fear, but from pure adrenaline.

*“Okay. Calm the hell down. Think.”*

He slows his wingbeats, hovering on a thermal updraft. The forest sprawls beneath him, dark and silent.

*“I’m a dragon. A freaking wyvern. There’s gotta be rules for this sort of thing. What do dragons even do?”*

He tries to list options:

* Find a village and scare the crap out of peasants.
* Hoard treasure.
* Find a princess and… well… let’s skip that one.
* Sleep on a mountain of gold.
* Burn something.
* Just fly forever.

He lets out a long, smoky sigh.

*“No. That’s all stupid. I’m not that kind of dragon.”*

He flaps his wings and climbs higher into the stars. The moon glints off his scales like polished armor.

*“I gotta think bigger. Smarter. I have a whole year…”*

He goes quiet. The wind hisses over the ridges of his wings. His slit pupils narrow.

And slowly…a grin spreads across his reptilian snout.

*“Oh. Oh… THAT could work.”*

He starts laughing,a low, rumbling, echoing sound that rolls down the mountainsides and sends a flock of birds exploding from the trees below.

But he doesn’t say a word about his plan. Not yet.

Dominik soars for hours, crossing rivers, forests, rolling hills. Dawn begins to bleed into the sky, washing the stars away in a pale, chilly glow.

He skims treetops, searching the land below with sharp, golden eyes. He’s on a mission now.

*“Okay. Gotta think logistics. If I’m gonna pull this off… I need humans. Preferably small ones. Less likely to freak out and call the military.”*

He angles his wings, banking east.

*“But not too close to a big city. I’m not ready for fighter jets and air raid sirens.”*

Below him, he spots a cozy valley tucked between low hills. Fields patchworked in green and gold. Tiny rooftops clustered together. Thin columns of smoke rising into the sky as morning fires are lit.

Dominik circles lower, keeping to the shadows of passing clouds.

*“Perfect. Small village. Probably not many security cameras. And… close enough for kids to wander off exploring.”*

He finds a forest just outside the village. Tall pine trees. A rocky hillside perfect for hiding.

He lands softly amid moss and ferns, folding his wings carefully. He tests the ground with his talons. No roads nearby. No electricity humming in the air. Just birdsong and the distant clang of a farm bell.

Dominik paces back and forth in the clearing.

*“Okay. I’ll stay hidden. Just… wait. Eventually, kids always wander into forests, right? Kids are curious. And if they see me…”*

He grins again,a slow, toothy wyvern grin.

*“…The legend begins.”*

He sits down, coils his tail around his talons, and settles in among the shadows. His emerald scales blend with the dappled sunlight streaming through pine needles.

And he waits.

Dominik waits in the forest all morning. Birds flit past him, unbothered. Squirrels chatter nervously but keep their distance.

Hours crawl by. He’s nearly dozing when he hears voices,high, giggling, chattering in a language he barely remembers how to process.

Children.

Dominik stiffens, then eases lower into the ferns, trying to make his massive emerald body invisible.

*“Okay, stay calm. Don’t roar. Don’t breathe fire. Just… be mysterious and dragon-y.”*

**A group of five kids emerges between the trees.**

Two boys chase each other with sticks. A girl carries a basket full of flowers. Another boy lags behind, clutching a wooden toy. The smallest girl stares at a beetle crawling on her sleeve.

Suddenly the kids freeze.

The older boy squints into the shadows.

“Hey… what’s that?”

The girl with the basket gasps.

“It’s a monster!”

Dominik blinks slowly. He lifts his head just enough for sunlight to catch the gleam of his scales. He unfurls a wing slightly, shimmering like black silk.

*“Easy… just let them see me.”*

The children stare. Wide-eyed. Mouths open. The little girl drops her flowers.

Dominik slowly opens his jaws and exhales a tiny puff of smoke,just a gentle dragon *hello*.

“AAAAHHHH!”

The entire group turns and bolts, shrieking at the top of their lungs. A basket clatters to the ground. The boy’s toy flies into the bushes. Branches snap as they disappear toward the village, yelling:

“DRAGON!! THERE’S A DRAGON!!”

Dominik sits back, tail swishing through pine needles. He watches the spot where the kids vanished, still hearing distant shrieks echoing through the forest.

Then he grins so wide his fangs gleam.

*“First objective complete.”*

He spreads his wings, lifts into the air, and soars off toward the next village.

*“One down… a few hundred more to go.”*

Dominik glides low over hills and meadows, wings whispering through cool morning air. Birds scatter from treetops as his shadow sweeps across the fields.

He spots another village in the distance,red roofs, stone chimneys, little winding streets. Perfect.

But first…

He lands atop a rocky outcrop overlooking the valley, folds his wings, and settles back on his haunches. He taps one claw thoughtfully against the stone.

*“Okay… gotta keep track. This is science.”*

He lifts a front talon, counting on his scaly fingers, brow ridges furrowed.

*“Village One… five kids.”*

He snickers under his breath. A low, bubbling sound rumbles in his throat like distant thunder.

*“Five terrified kids. Excellent.”*

He counts off another claw.

*“Next village… let’s say… aim for at least four. Gotta stay under ten each time or it gets suspicious.”*

Dominik’s tail flicks excitedly, sweeping gravel off the ledge. He tries,and fails,to suppress a giddy grin.

*“Hehehe. Oh man… I am going to be such a legend.”*

He suddenly realizes he’s giggling. Like a giant, scaly villain plotting world domination. He slaps his tail against the rock to stop himself.

*“Shh! Gotta stay sneaky. Suspicious giggling does not help.”*

He draws a deep breath, letting smoke curl lazily from his nostrils. Then he leaps into the air and heads toward the next village, eyes sparkling with mischief.

 

Dominik lands high on a craggy ridge, wings folding close to his body. He’s panting slightly,not from exhaustion, but from pure *glee*.

He peers out over miles of valleys and clustered villages. Tiny specks of rooftops dot the land like colorful pebbles.

He sits back on his haunches, claws clicking as he counts.

*“Okay… let’s review.”*

He begins ticking off claws again.

*“First village: five kids.”*  
*“Second village: eight kids.”*  
*“Third… twelve. Fourth… six. Fifth… nine…”*

His tail twitches as he adds under his breath.

*“…and the big school field trip in that national park… forty-three. Hehehe.”*

Dominik tries,and fails,to keep a serious face. His nostrils flare with smoky laughter.

*“Aaaaaand that brings us to… one hundred twenty-seven terrified children who’ve all seen a dragon. Major Objective One… complete.”*

He lifts his snout triumphantly toward the sky, a thin plume of smoke spiraling into the wind.

*“Let the legend begin.”*

He giggles again,deep, rolling, dragon laughter that echoes off the mountainsides

Dominik glides low over a sunlit hillside in Germany. A soft breeze ripples fields of grass and wildflowers.

He lands near a lonely hiking trail, eyes darting around for witnesses. None.

Carefully, he raises one hind leg and scratches along his flank, flicking loose three shimmering scales. Each one catches the sun like hammered emeralds.

He nudges them under a rock, leaving just a glint visible.

*“Perfect. Just enough to get some biologist losing sleep for a year.”*

He snickers, then takes off toward the next destination, wings slicing the air.

High in the Himalayas, Dominik claws a hidden chamber into a cliffside. Wind screams outside like a thousand howling ghosts.

He scratches symbols into the stone walls,a language nobody on Earth can read. Then, in plain English, he carves one haunting sentence:

**“The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk.”**

He steps back, admiring his handiwork.

*“Mmm… that’ll keep historians busy for decades.”*

A sly grin curls across his scaly face.

Deep inside a volcanic cave in Iceland, molten rock glows like fiery rivers.

Dominik squeezes through narrow stone tunnels until he reaches a cavern shimmering with heat.

There, he places a single, enormous dragon finger bone on an obsidian shelf,its surface etched with faint glowing runes.

*“This… is for the grand finale, im gonna miss my finger thou.”*

He stares at the bone, imagining the look on archaeologists’ faces one day.

*“Major Objective Two… complete.”*

Dominik unfurls his wings, a silhouette of shadow and emerald against the molten glow, and vanishes into the darkness.

He soars above the Pacific under a sky bursting with stars. Cold wind tears past his wings. He’s been flying for hours, wings aching, every beat counting down the seconds.

*“Tokyo. Gotta make it before sunrise. This only works if I’m on schedule.”*

Dominik streaks through the Tokyo night sky, wings booming with every beat. Neon lights shimmer across his scales. Below, Shibuya glows like a circuit board come alive.

His heart thunders, both with fear and electric triumph.

*“It’s gotta be perfect… to the second.”*

**On the streets below:**

Crowds stare upward. Broadcasters scream into microphones. Screens announce:

**“TONIGHT: THE FUTURE OF LASERS & HOLOGRAMS!”**

People cheer, expecting lights in the sky.

Instead,they get Dominik.

He barrels toward the city, twisting between towers. Cameras catch every angle. Smoke billows behind him like a comet’s tail.

“DRAGON!”  
“That’s a hologram!”  
“It’s real!”

Dominik roars once,a sound so deep it rattles windows forty floors up.

He spots the perfect skyscraper. Tall. Flat roof. Neon lights flickering along the edges.

*“Here we go…”*

Dominik tilts his wings, dives, and arcs toward the building. He flies along one side, scales glinting under spotlights, and at the last moment surges **upward**,clearing the edge of the roof in a single powerful stroke.

Crowds below see him vanish behind the building’s edge…

…but he **never comes out the other side.**

**Rooftop:**

Dominik slams onto the roof, claws scraping concrete.

*“Three… two… one…”*

He feels it,the change. His bones collapse inward. Wings shrink, scales melt into bare skin.

In a rush of freezing air and spiraling neon light, the dragon disappears.

Dominik opens his eyes, shivering, blinking under the glow of a rooftop neon sign. He’s human again. Naked, pale, breath puffing steam into the cold.

He glances back toward the roof’s edge.

*“…Nailed it.”*

**Below:**

People scream, searching the skies.

“WHERE DID IT GO?!”  
“It didn’t fly through,it just vanished!”

A hundred videos start uploading to the internet. The legend explodes.

Dominik sits on the rooftop, shivering under neon lights that flicker pink and electric blue across the gravel. His breath hisses in sharp clouds of steam.

Tokyo hums below him,a living, breathing neon ocean.

He curls his arms around his bare chest, goosebumps dotting his skin where scales used to be.

*“Okay… okay. Deep breath.”*

He takes a moment, gazing over the skyline.

*“I did it. Flew through Tokyo. Scared the shit out of thousands. Objective Three… complete.”*

A grin tugs at his lips, even as he’s trembling.

*“Now the legend’s unstoppable. Kids all over the world saw me. Scales are hidden. Finger bone waiting. Prophecy carved into stone. Perfect. Everything’s ready for,”*

He freezes. His eyes go wide.

Dominik jerks upright so fast he nearly slips off a rooftop air vent.

“OH SHIIIIIIIT!!! I’M IN JAPAN AND I DON’T HAVE MY PASS!”

Sweat breaks out across his forehead despite the freezing wind.

He looks wildly around, as if a customs officer might pop up behind the rooftop satellite dish.

*“…How the hell am I getting home?”*

He slumps back down, running a hand through his hair, groaning.

*“I just pulled off the greatest dragon prank in human history… and now I’m going to get arrested for illegal entry and indecent exposure.”*

Dominik, still shivering on the rooftop, finally spots something miraculous: a row of rooftop dryers spinning in the neon glow.

Moments later, he’s stuffing himself into someone’s slightly-too-small jogging outfit. Bright pink. With a Hello Kitty logo.

*“Not exactly dragon worthy… but it’ll do.”*

He bolts down the stairwell, avoiding security cameras, and slips into Tokyo’s crowded streets.

Hours later, disheveled and exhausted, he stands panting in front of the German consulate.

“I need help. And… maybe a plane ticket.”

Somehow, Dominik gets his emergency documents. A few awkward questions later, he’s on a flight home,grinning out the airplane window as Tokyo vanishes beneath the clouds.

*“Next stop: becoming the Dragon Whisperer.”*

Dominik sits at his kitchen table in Germany, clutching a steaming mug of coffee. Outside, rain taps gently on the window.

It’s been a few months since Tokyo. He’s back in jeans and a hoodie, looking completely ordinary… except for the occasional faraway gleam in his eyes.

He flips open his laptop, fingers hovering over the keyboard. He takes a deep breath.

*“Okay… moment of truth.”*

He types:

**dragon sighting tokyo**

**Instantly, pages explode across the screen:**

* **“DRAGON SEEN IN TOKYO: Laser Show or Real Creature?”**
* **“Eyewitnesses Swear It Wasn’t CGI!”**
* **“Children Across Europe Claim to Have Seen a Dragon Too,Coincidence?”**

Dominik’s eyes widen. He scrolls feverishly.

*“Holy crap… it worked.”*

Conspiracy forums are ablaze. Reddit threads stretch thousands of comments long. News articles show blurry phone videos of a green, winged creature streaking over neon-lit buildings.

He leans back, a slow grin spreading across his face.

*“They’re trying so hard to explain it away… but they just can’t.”*

He sips his coffee, triumphant.

*“Time for Phase Two.”*

Dominik slams his laptop shut, eyes sparkling.

*“Right. Enough internet. Time to make this real.”*

He tosses coffee back like a shot, jumps up, and hauls a battered hiking backpack from the closet. He stuffs it with:

* Rope
* Gloves
* Flashlight
* Tupperware box (for dragon scales, obviously)
* A sandwich

He zips it shut, grabs his hiking boots, and storms out the door.

**Hours later, in the Allgäu Alps…**

Pine trees rise like emerald walls. Mountain peaks cut jagged lines against a crisp blue sky.

Dominik trudges up a winding trail, panting slightly.

*“God, I miss flying.”*

He reaches a rocky hillside above a narrow hiking path. He drops to his knees and starts pulling aside stones, dirt caking his hands.

Moments later, sunlight flashes on **three small, shimmering green scales.**

Dominik holds them up, eyes wide, heart pounding.

*“Perfect. This is where it all begins.”*

He places them gently into the Tupperware, seals the lid, and stares at the horizon.

*“The Dragon Whisperer… coming soon.”*

Dominik barrels down the autobahn in his old Volkswagen, the dragon scales packed neatly in the Tupperware on the passenger seat.

*“Okay… stay calm. Don’t start babbling about being a dragon. Just… show them the evidence.”*

He repeats it to himself like a mantra all the way to München.

**Hours later…**

Dominik strides through the grand glass doors of the **Deutsches Museum.** Marble floors gleam under bright lights. Visitors shuffle past vintage planes and gleaming scientific models.

Dominik approaches the information desk, trying to look casual despite the Tupperware clutched in his hands.

“Hi. Um… I’d like to speak with someone about… rare biological specimens.”

The woman behind the desk raises an eyebrow.

“Of… what kind?”

Dominik leans forward conspiratorially.

“Dragon scales.”

**Minutes later…**

A museum biologist sits across a lab table from Dominik, peering through thick glasses. Dominik carefully pops open the Tupperware.

Green scales glitter under fluorescent lights.

“These,” Dominik says, voice trembling with excitement, “are not from any reptile known to science.”

The biologist blinks. Picks up a scale with tweezers. Holds it to the light.

“Interesting… the structure’s unlike crocodile keratin… very layered…”

Dominik fights a grin.

*“Oh buddy. You have no idea.”*

Moments later, the biologist clears his throat.

“Where… exactly… did you find these?”

Dominik smiles innocently.

“Hiking. In the Allgäu.”

“We’ll… need to run tests. We’ll contact you when we know more.”

 Dominik leaves, feeling like he’s walking on air.

“It’s started.”

Days later, Dominik sits at his kitchen table, surrounded by paints, pencils, and blank paper. He works for weeks, drawing and writing. Late nights turn to early mornings. Coffee cups pile up around him. He glues a few shimmering scales onto the cover of a small book, so they catch the light when tilted. He flips through the pages, nodding in satisfaction.

“This is going to blow their minds.”

 He snaps the book shut and gazes at the scaly cover.

“They’ll never see this coming.”

A month later, Dominik steps off a plane into the dry, blistering heat of the Nevada desert. He wears dark sunglasses and a sunhat pulled low.

He drives for hours into endless rocky emptiness until he finds the perfect spot,a narrow canyon hidden away from roads and tourist trails.

He hikes in under a blazing sun, clutching a weatherproof satchel.

Dominik kneels beside a large boulder, scrapes aside loose gravel, and digs a shallow pit.

He carefully places the **book** inside, tucking it under a ledge where shadows keep it cool.

He sprinkles a few extra dragon scales around it, burying them lightly under dust and small stones.

*“Just enough to make someone really believe.”*

Dominik stands, brushes dirt from his jeans, and stares down at his secret.

*“One day… someone’s going to find you. And the legend will never die.”*

He turns and walks back through the canyon, leaving nothing but the whisper of wind and a glint of emerald under the desert sun.

 

Months after Dominik hides his secret book in Nevada, a young climber named Raj scrambles across a windswept Himalayan ridge, searching for a new route. Sunlight glints off ice and stone. His fingers brush something odd,a section of stone covered in neat scratches. He leans closer, brushing frost away. Letters emerge, perfectly carved into the rock face:

 “The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk.”

 Raj blinks.

“…Weird.”

 Later that night: I

n a smoky mountain hostel, Raj uploads a photo to Instagram with the caption:

 “Found strange carving in the Himalayas. Anyone know what this means?”

The internet explodes. Within hours, Reddit threads stretch into thousands of comments:

“This is linked to the dragon sightings!”

“Ancient prophecy confirmed!”

“Proof of hidden civilizations!”

News outlets broadcast segments. YouTubers dissect every pixel of the carving. Conspiracy theories spread like wildfire. The prophecy goes viral. From that day on, the entire world knows the cryptic phrase:

“The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk.”

Months after the viral explosion around the Himalayan prophecy carving, Dominik can’t sit still any longer. He sits hunched over his kitchen table, coffee going cold, eyes darting between news articles. Reddit threads about dragons are burning up the internet.

 “They’re getting closer. Someone’s gonna go looking for the big stuff next.”

Dominik stands abruptly, grabs his battered hiking pack, and books a flight to Iceland.

 “Time to collect the ultimate proof.”

He trudges across volcanic plains, battered by icy winds that howl like ghosts. He finds the narrow crack in the ground and squeezes through, descending into darkness. The tunnels grow stiflingly hot. Rivers of molten rock glow like liquid gold. At last, he emerges into the magma-lit chamber where he left it years ago.

He approaches the obsidian shelf. There it is , the massive dragon finger bone , dark, glossy, etched faintly with runes, still gleaming under the molten glow. Dominik swallows hard. “One day… someone’s going to see you. And they’ll never doubt dragons again.

” He wraps the finger bone in shirts and scarves, cushioning it in his pack.

 “Okay. Now… just get through customs.”

 

At Keflavík International Airport, Dominik stands in line, humming nervously. He places his backpack on the conveyor belt. Seconds later, security flags him down.

“Sir… can you step aside, please?”

A security officer opens his backpack and freezes.

“What… exactly… is this?”

 Dominik fidgets, glancing around.

“Um… an archaeological… artifact?”

“From where?”

“Iceland. Sort of. I’m… on a work trip. I’m an archaeologist.”

 

Another officer comes over and lifts the finger bone, turning it under the bright lights.

“Why does this look… reptilian?”

Dominik wipes sweat off his brow.

 “Volcanic fossilization. Very rare. Totally scientific.”

 

They run his name. One young officer gasps, tapping his tablet:

 “Hey. Isn’t this the guy who brought those dragon scales to the Deutsches Museum?” Dominik’s eyes go wide.

 “Well… yes. But,”

After hours of questions, paperwork, and head-scratching, they decide:

“Look… this is super weird, but you don’t look like a smuggler. We’re going to confiscate… whatever this is… until we can analyze it.”

Dominik tries to protest as they carry the bone away.

“But… that’s crucial evidence,!”

A senior officer sighs.

 “Sir, please just go catch your flight.”

Dominik slumps toward the departure gates, muttering under his breath:

 “Note to self: dragons should never fly commercial.”

Years slip by like leaves drifting on wind. Dominik returns to Germany, determined to keep quiet. He spends his days drinking coffee, browsing forums, and pretending to be a normal guy. But the world refuses to let the dragon rumors die.

• News channels rerun the Tokyo dragon footage every few months.

• Scientists keep testing the Allgäu scales, baffled by their strange layered structure.

• Online conspiracy theorists connect every scrap of evidence into bigger and wilder plots. Dominik tries to stay under the radar.

“Maybe… just maybe… this will all blow over.”

 But in quiet moments, he scrolls Reddit, seeing his legend grow bigger and more tangled than even he imagined.

“Holy crap… what have I done?”

Then one autumn morning, everything changes. Dominik sits in his kitchen, sunlight slanting through the window, coffee steaming.

His phone buzzes with an urgent news notification:

“LEAKED GOVERNMENT REPORT: Confiscated Fossil May Be Evidence of REAL DRAGON.” 

Dominik almost drops his mug.

 

Details pour out:

 • Photos of the dragon finger bone on a metal table, runes visible.

• Lab reports calling it “biological structure not matching any known species.”

• Mentions that the same man , Dominik , was previously connected to mysterious dragon scales in Germany.

 

Within hours, Reddit goes nuclear:

“DID YOU SEE THE RUNE BONE?

This proves dragons existed!""

“It’s all connected , the scales, the Tokyo dragon, the Himalaya prophecy!”

“Dominik the Dragon Whisperer is either a hero… or the biggest troll in human history.”

 

News anchors shout over each other. Documentaries scramble to re-edit. Youtube explodes with conspiracy videos. Dominik just sits there, staring at his phone in disbelief.

 “…Goddammit. I wanted to reveal this on my terms.”

 He rubs his temples.

“Well… guess it’s showtime.”

Months turn into years. The leaked photos of the dragon finger bone ripple outward like shockwaves. News programs replay them endlessly. Scientists appear on talk shows, shaking their heads in disbelief. “The bone’s cellular structure… it’s not reptile. Not mammal. We’ve never seen anything like it.”

Reddit explodes daily:

“This connects to the scales found in Germany!”

“The Himalaya carving was a warning!”

“Dominik knows more. He’s hiding the rest of the dragon civilization.”

Dominik spends his days shuffling between his apartment and quiet walks in the park. Paparazzi sometimes stalk him from a distance. He wears sunglasses, pulls a cap low over his eyes, and tries not to laugh when he overhears people whispering:

 “That’s Dominik the Dragon Whisperer. He’s the guy who might have been a dragon.”

 

He can’t go anywhere without conspiracy theorists trying to corner him:

 • In cafés:

“Mr. Dominik! Tell us about the runes!”

• On buses:

“Is the Tokyo dragon real?”

• At the grocery store:

“My cousin saw scales on a mountainside. Was that you?”

Dominik keeps his answers vague.

 “I just found some scales. Who knows what’s out there?”

 But sometimes, late at night, he sits alone in the dark, staring at his old dragon sketches, a wistful grin on his face.

 “They’ll never really let this go… even if they know the truth.”

 

Dominik grows older. His hair grays. His steps slow. But his eyes still sparkle when anyone mentions dragons. He watches the world swirl around his legend:

• Documentaries titled Dragongate hit streaming services.

• Scientists release papers speculating about hidden species.

 • Children in playgrounds play

“Dominik the Dragon.”

Dominik chuckles sometimes.

 “If only they knew it was all a cosmic joke.”

 But the weight of the secret presses heavier on him every year.

He remembers the Nevada desert, the hidden book with scales on the cover.

“One day… they’ll find it. And then it’ll all come out.”

 But part of him can’t bear to leave the world hanging forever.

So one gray winter morning, Dominik wakes up in bed, coughing, lungs rattling. He stares out the window at falling snow, white and silent. He knows he’s running out of time. Dominik takes a deep breath.

“It’s time. They deserve the last piece.”

Dominik ends up in the hospital after a coughing fit leaves him gasping for air. Nurses bustle around him, adjusting IV drips and checking monitors. The walls are pale blue. The air smells like antiseptic and distant winter. Dominik lies there for days, staring at the ceiling.

The news leaks fast:

“Dominik the Dragon Whisperer hospitalized in critical condition.”

 TV anchors discuss his life:

 • The Tokyo dragon sighting.

• The mysterious scales.

 • The Himalaya prophecy.

• The confiscated finger bone. People gather outside the hospital, holding signs:

“Tell us the truth, Dominik!”

“Dragons are real!”

 “The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk!”

Inside, Dominik’s phone buzzes constantly on the bedside table:

 • Journalists begging for interviews.

 • Scientists asking for any last clues.

 • Fans from around the world sending messages like:

“We love you, Dragon Whisperer!”

 “You changed my life!”

“Don’t leave us without answers!”

Dominik reads them with a soft, tired smile.

“Man… all this for one big prank...

 After two weeks, Dominik feels weaker each day. His breath rattles in his chest like dry leaves. One night, he lies awake as moonlight spills across the floor.

He remembers Nevada, the hidden book, scales sparkling in desert dust. He thinks of all the children who swore they saw a dragon.

 “I can’t let them wonder forever.”

 Dominik presses the nurse call button. When she appears, he whispers:

 “I need you… to call the press. All of them.”

 The nurse blinks.

“All… of them?”

Dominik’s smile is faint but unmistakable.

“Tell them… Dominik the Dragon Whisperer… has one last thing to say.”

A few days later, the hospital is swarming. Journalists crowd the hallways. TV crews set up lights and cameras. Security guards try to keep order as fans press against the windows, hoping for a glimpse of the man who might have been a dragon. Inside a quiet hospital room, Dominik lies propped up on pillows, pale and frail, tubes hissing softly around him. But his eyes are sharp as ever, glinting like gold coins. A nurse gently adjusts the microphone near his lips. A hush falls over the room as dozens of reporters lean forward, holding their breath.

 

A young reporter clears his throat.

“Dominik… were dragons real?”

Dominik smiles faintly. His voice is low and raspy but steady.

 “I’ve kept my secrets for a long time. Some things… I did because I wanted to see how far a legend could go.”

 He pauses, catching his breath.

“But I owe you all an answer. So… my last help to you… to understand…”

He coughs, wincing, then manages a small grin.

 “Go to Nevada. Desert. Book… with scales. Find it… and you shall understand.”

 

Journalists erupt into chaos.

“WHERE in Nevada?”

“What’s in the book?”

“Dominik, were you the Tokyo dragon?!”

 Dominik just chuckles weakly, eyes twinkling. He gathers one last breath and murmurs:

“A place of sand where secrets sleep, scales guard words the wise must keep.

Find the truth where stones lie cracked, what’s written there shall bring it back.”

He closes his eyes with a sly, exhausted grin.

 “…Let’s see how long it takes them… to solve that riddle.”

 

Outside, news anchors shout into cameras:

“Dominik the Dragon Whisperer has delivered a cryptic final clue from his deathbed,in riddles, like a true dragon would!”

“Nevada desert searches are already underway.”

 “Was it all true… or the world’s greatest prank?”

 

Within minutes, Reddit explodes:

“OH MY GOD HE SPOKE IN RIDDLES LIKE A DRAGON!”

 “GUYS. We need to decode that poem. Line by line.”

 “This is proof there’s a hidden dragon civilization. He was TALKING LIKE A DRAGON.”

 “The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk. It’s all connected.”

“I SWEAR DOMINIK’S STILL TROLLING US FROM HIS HOSPITAL BED.”

Dominik’s riddle spreads across the world like wildfire. Every news outlet runs breathless specials dissecting each line.

• “A place of sand where secrets sleep…”

• “Scales guard words the wise must keep…”

• “Find the truth where stones lie cracked…”

• “…what’s written there shall bring it back.”

Conspiracy forums crash under the flood of traffic. YouTube explodes with videos titled things like:

“Dominik’s Final Riddle Decoded! (Proof Dragons Exist)”

 Reddit is a hurricane of madness:

“IT’S DEFINITELY AREA 51!”

“No,it’s in the Black Rock Desert, near Burning Man!”

 “The ‘stones cracked’ part has to mean canyon walls.”

“Scales = his secret book!”

“Dominik was LITERALLY a dragon. He’s still speaking Dragonish.”

And so… the Nevada desert becomes ground zero.

The Raid Tens of thousands of people flood into Nevada.

• RVs stretch along highways for miles.

 • Tents cover the desert like a pop-up city.

• Influencers livestream nonstop:

“Day 12 of the #DragonBookHunt,we’re digging under EVERY rock!”

Hashtags trend worldwide: #DragonBook #NevadaRaid #DominikRiddle #DragonWhisperer

 

People dig with shovels. Scan the earth with metal detectors. Fly drones into canyons. After 34 days of blistering sun and freezing nights, a small group of exhausted treasure hunters finally strikes something hard beneath a boulder.

 “GUYS. IT’S HERE! THE BOOK! WE FOUND IT!”

They lift a small satchel, dust clinging to its weatherproof surface. Scales glitter faintly where sunlight hits the cover.

The crowd goes wild. People chant Dominik’s name. Cameras flash. News crews elbow each other for the shot

 

Within hours, a thunder of helicopter blades rattles the sky. Military trucks roar across the sand. Soldiers in desert camo surround the dig site, rifles slung across their chests. A commanding officer raises a megaphone:

“By order of the U.S. government, this artifact is now classified material!”

 People scream in protest.

“IT’S JUST A BOOK!”

“FREE THE DRAGON TRUTH!”

“DOMINIK BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE!”

But the soldiers confiscate the scaly book and haul it away in armored vehicles.

 

Inside a secure military bunker, generals and scientists cluster around a stainless-steel table. One scientist carefully peels away layers of cloth. There lies the book: small, leather-bound, shimmering faintly with scales glued to the cover. They open it,and find pages full of painted dragons, bright colors, and simple rhymes. A scientist flips to the page showing cartoon autumn leaves drifting from a tree. Beneath it reads:

“The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk.”

 He squints, tracing the words with a gloved finger.

“It’s… a riddle. Or a code. Maybe referring to seasonal change… or… something else?”

 A general folds his arms.

 “It’s written like a children’s book. But this man faked dragon sightings worldwide. He left runes in the Himalayas. We can’t dismiss this as nonsense.”

Another scientist rubs his brow.

“There might be hidden meaning. Microprinting. Chemical markers. It could be a message for others of his… kind.”

The room goes silent, heavy with the weight of implications. Finally, the general says quietly:

“Whatever this is… the public can’t see it. Not yet.”

They seal the book in a military evidence case, eyes full of wary confusion.

The Nevada desert simmers under a white-hot sun. But across the ocean, in a small, dim office in Washington D.C., a bored twenty-year-old government intern stares at a classified folder on his screen. He’s not supposed to be reading it. But curiosity burns hotter than any clearance level.

On his monitor glow photographs:

 • The scaly cover of Dominik’s Nevada book.

• Pages full of cute dragon paintings.

• And, most importantly, a page with cartoon autumn leaves drifting from a tree above the words:

“The fall begins when the bodiless start to walk.”

The intern blinks, mouthing the words.

“Seriously? It’s… about leaves falling?”

 He flips pages faster. Rhymes. Childlike riddles. No codes. No secret coordinates. His jaw drops. 

“No way. Dominik trolled the entire world.”

He hesitates. He knows the consequences. Then he opens Discord and fires off a message in a private conspiracy server: DragonWhisperer\_1999:

“GUYS. You won’t believe this. The Dragon Book from Nevada? It’s literally a children’s book. The prophecy is about leaves falling. IT WAS ALL A PUN.”

The internet goes nuclear within hours.

Reddit’s front page floods with posts:

“DOMINIK FOOLED EVERYONE. THE PROPHECY WAS ABOUT LEAVES.”

“I SPENT TEN GRAND DIGGING IN NEVADA FOR A KIDS’ BOOK.”

 “He’s the greatest prankster who ever lived.”

 “Or… was this part of a bigger plan? WHAT IF HE WANTED US TO THINK IT’S A PUN?”

 

Late-night hosts howl with laughter:

 “Dominik the Dragon Whisperer just confirmed what every ex ever told me: men will go to insane lengths instead of just telling the truth.”

But even as the world laughs, a single Reddit thread climbs to the top:

“WAIT. If Dominik’s Nevada book is a children’s book… WHO THE HELL WAS IT WRITTEN FOR??”

Top comments explode:

 “Duuude. That means there are dragon children out there who were supposed to read it.”

“OH MY GOD. The book wasn’t for humans. It was for BABY DRAGONS.”

 “This changes everything. Dominik wasn’t trolling us. He was leaving a manual for his dragon kin.”

“So… there’s an entire dragon civilization somewhere raising kids who speak in riddles???”

 “The prophecy was a pun. But what if that’s how dragons teach their kids to hide the truth???”

 

People refuse to let go:

 • The Tokyo footage remains unexplained.

 • Scientists still can’t replicate the unique layered structure of Dominik’s scales.

• The Himalaya carving stands untouched and ancient, etched high above the world

Dominik may be gone. But his legend refuses to die. And now, a new question burns through every conspiracy forum:

1mg4rgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1mg4rgo/help_me_not_exploit_an_intern/,Help me not exploit an intern!,"Hey guys! Weird title I know- but let me explain!

I own a small coffee shop in a beach town where many people spend their summer vacations. I was playing with the idea of looking for a “social media intern” for next summer. I have a few questions. Some have been answered here before but were pretty old and obviously, this industry is ever changing!

My questions are:

What structure or expectations should I set to set them up for success? X amount of posts per week/day/etc, or let them take the lead on that?

How can I make this a true internship experience for them? My thoughts were that I can provide a product/business with a following, and they can see the engagement difference and analytics from what they post. The posts are on a public business page, where they can reference it to potential future employers as proof of work?

Lastly, pay. 
1.) Is pay per post a thing? 
2.) If so, do you do different pricing for post/reel?

I truly am looking for an “intern” and am okay with them not having experience, and welcome them to “try out” different ideas to see what works and what doesn’t! I can offer tips and tricks as to what has worked for us in the past (in true small biz fashion I have worn the hat of social media manager for a while. As well as 6392917 other hats lol)
Obviously hourly is a thing, but we don’t have an “office” - it’s all either kitchen or cafe space, so there wouldn’t really be an option for that. Thinking pay per post is better on both ends because I don’t have to stress about not providing a work space, and they don’t have to create content in a chaotic, busy space. 

My thing is I’m a mid 20 something business owner without a whole lotta extra cash (but enough to look into this kinda thing!) and I am ideally trying to help out AND get help from another young 20 something in a mutually beneficial way. Aka I can’t pay a whole lot of money, but I want it to be comparable to another internship position where you’re paid in real monies, and also the ability to expand your portfolio and invest in your future self being more attractive to employers who are richer than I am😂 

BUT I also know that a lot of people can be predatory with this kind of thing, offering like $5 a post. Respect to those who would take that job, but I sure wouldn’t. However I can also say that we really would offer a good opportunity for practice. I mean I’ll be the first to say some of my reels and posts are made half assed and half drunk from my bed after a 12 hour shift and they still get thousands of views. So at risk of sounding stupid, I truly do think I could offer a lil someone a lil something.

I guess the real question is if this were an opportunity YOU were looking into when you were part way through college or whatever, what would you be looking for?  ",2,1754178241.0,SocialMediaMarketing,0,1.0,False

It’s the primary tool you'll use every day, and becoming an expert in one or two platforms is a key selling point for your services.

While there are many options out there, the remote bookkeeping world is dominated by three main players. Here’s a practical breakdown of each:

**1. QuickBooks Online (QBO)**

* **The 800-Pound Gorilla:** QBO is the undisputed industry standard in the United States. The vast majority of small businesses and accountants use it or are at least familiar with it.
* **Who It's For:** It's a powerful, all-purpose tool that can handle almost any small-to-medium-sized business, from a local coffee shop to a small marketing agency.
* **The Bottom Line:** If you're unsure where to start, start with QBO. Its market dominance means that specializing in it gives you access to the largest number of potential clients. They also offer a free and robust certification program for bookkeepers and accountants, which is a great way to learn the software and get a credential for your resume.

**2. Xero**

* **The Sleek Contender:** Xero is QBO's biggest competitor and is known for its beautiful, user-friendly design and strong features. It's particularly popular outside of the U.S. but has a growing and passionate user base everywhere.
* **Who It's For:** Xero often appeals to tech startups, e-commerce stores (it has great integrations), and creative agencies. It's known for excellent bank feeds and unlimited users per subscription.
* **The Bottom Line:** Xero is a fantastic piece of software and a very valuable skill to have. Many bookkeepers choose to specialize in both QBO and Xero to broaden their client base. Like QBO, Xero also offers a free certification program.

**3. FreshBooks**

* **The Invoicing Specialist:** FreshBooks started as a simple invoicing tool for freelancers and has since grown into a more complete bookkeeping solution. Its biggest strength remains its exceptional invoicing and time-tracking features.
* **Who It's For:** It's an excellent choice for service-based businesses, freelancers, consultants, and contractors who need robust invoicing and expense tracking but may not need the complexity of a full-blown system like QBO.
* **The Bottom Line:** While not as comprehensive as QBO or Xero, specializing in FreshBooks could be a smart move if you plan to build a niche business serving freelancers and independent contractors.

**My Advice:** Don't try to learn all of them at once. Pick one (QBO is the safest bet) and go deep. Use the free trial and work through their free certification program. Once you're confident, you can always expand your skills to another platform.",1,1754178216.0,Bookkeeping_Business,0,1.0,False

People were panicking and I sensed that it could turn out to be a very bad day for my $200K ULTY position.

I the. took my dog out for a long 45min walk instead of staying at my seat with eyes glued to ThinkorSwim.

Came back, had some coffee + L-theanine, and opened up this app I made to monitor ULTY’s risk and exposure in real-time.

After digesting the info: here’s what it showed me.

1. Price change was around -2.1% with -4.5% from the long stock positions.

2. So I knew that the balance of +2.4% came from the options sleeve.

3. Looked at the intraday trades at lunch and reran the numbers.  Confirmed that we were going to be up 0.4% net premium.

4. Means the implied options p&l was going to be +2% driven mostly by the protective puts.

5.  Looked at the IV analysis and average premiums were still at juicy 100%.

So ULTY was working as expected and would recover.

Finally, turned off my computer and went to beach with my dog.

Hey everyone, Happy Saturday! 
First post here, and relatively new to Espresso. 

Recently purchased a Turin DF54  as my first decent grinder thats capable of getting coffee fine enough for Espresso, and have been getting to know it over the course of a week. I'm struggling to wrap my head around grind settings on this DF54. 

My current best pull has been as follows:

15g in, 30 out in 17 seconds, with a five second first-drip. Medium roast beans, six days off roast,  from a local PNW roaster called Compass Coffee.
The grinder was set at one. Yes, one... anything more corse than that, the shot time is even shorter than 17 seconds.

The machine is an old Starbucks branded Saeco, with a 14g basket.  I've removed the internal parts that make the portafilter  pressurized so that effectively, the portafilter is a normal unpressurized portafilter. 

My puck prep is very standard by today's current espresso trend. three sprays of RDT, shaken and slow-fed into the grinder. Then, dumped into the 14g basket and distributed with WDT. Once even, tap once on counter, and tamper with a 30lb spring loaded tamper then put on puck screen. Basket is preheated twice.  

Most people are reporting that a 20-10 setting is getting them a great pull in 20+ seconds. What gives? My grinder is at a -5 true zero, which seems pretty normal for this grinder. Yet, im at nearly 0 for a 17 second shot?  The basket is a 14g basket, and Im putting 15g in to help close up the air gap a bit. There's still room for the puck screen and a little air though. Thoughts? Appreciate any feedback.

1mg4j34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mg4j34/lithuania/,Lithuania,"The world disappeared around the little house in Zarasai; it was the farthest place in Lithuania from the sea, but Lake Zarasas extended so far to the horizon in all directions that its opposite bank seemed the shore of a foreign country. The house, situated on a tiny peninsula, had a view of the water from almost every window. A ring of trees around the back formed the bounds for its garden, isolating it from the rest of the town. Come summertime, wildflowers filled the grass with color, like stars dotting the night sky. Every morning when Oxana Jocienė woke up with the warmth of her husband beside her, she turned around to open the window above her headboard, like a princess surveying her land from a castle turret. She never could quite believe that she'd managed to escape her poor village in Russia, hitchhike across the border, and find a man who loved and provided for her—so, every night, to suppress the insomnia that still haunted her, she described the scene to herself as she lay in bed: blue sky, green grass, cobbled driveway, brick façade, french windows. And then, Judite would wake up in her parents' basement rental in Brazil.

Judite didn't know where she'd gotten the idea of being a Russian teenage runaway. She didn't want to be six feet tall or platinum blond, like Oxana; she knew it was a type some men liked, but in any case, she'd rather have been shorter than taller. Although she hated her name, she wouldn't have liked Oxana for herself either. Nor did she want to live in Lithuania, or get married—she was much too accustomed to solitude. Judite hadn't even always imagined herself as the character Oxana Jocienė. As far back as her early childhood, she'd superimposed her consciousness onto celebrities and characters from various media she'd enjoyed. Oxana was Judite's first original dream-persona, and also the longest-lived: Judite had created her in upper secondary school and brought her along into university. Oxana's friends were Judite's company when she got ready at five-thirty in the morning and waited at the bus stop in the sunless cold. They reappeared when she ate lunch alone on a bench outside, surrounded by construction workers whose cigarette smoke pooled into a fog that clouded Judite's senses. At night she lulled herself to sleep by imagining Oxana's house: blue sky, green grass, cobbled driveway, brick façade, french windows.

Judite retreated into her mind whenever she wasn't speaking to anyone, and she lived her life in silence—at church, in her classes, at awkward family dinners, by herself at home. Even when she wrote papers or took exams, she had to imagine herself as Oxana, with people around her offering ideas and encouragement. She easily forgot her own existence when there was no one acknowledging it. Like all first-year university students, she had once flirted with clubs and campus organizations but could never fully invest herself and invariably slipped into the background. She'd been apathetic in her second year, but her third came with the clawing fear that if she missed her window, she'd never have a proper social life. Her mother had so often told her that university was the place to make lifelong friends and that forming new bonds became impossible afterward. The campus itself was too overwhelming, with all the cliques set in stone. She could take up volunteering or an internship to give herself purpose, but there weren't many openings, and she couldn't imagine adjusting to a large and well-oiled machine filled with people older and more knowledgeable than her. She needed an intimate setting, somewhere she could never become an outcast. A sign stapled to the door of a library near her school advertised a need for part-time workers; after ruminating for days, Judite filled out an application. The time slot overlapped with her lunch break—no matter how tedious the work was, she'd at least be able to escape the smoke and the catcalling.

The library was just how Judite remembered it to be when she arrived for her first shift: quiet, with a few rude boys cutting class to play games on the computers, and with all the colors muted as if a layer of dust had settled over every surface. She only saw one other employee—a young woman at the desk, eating salad out of a clear plastic takeout container. She was light-skinned, with soft, mousy hair, and she smiled at Judite when she walked in. Judite waited for her to speak first, but she looked away without saying anything.

""Hi."" Judite's voice came out higher than it was in her head.

""Hi,"" the girl said. ""Are you looking for something?""

Judite explained that she'd come in to work but that the job description hadn't been very specific.

""Most of what we do is just check books out for people. When it's empty—like today—you can just hang out here or step out for a bit to get coffee. Technically you're not allowed to leave, but nobody's watching. I'm Dalila, by the way.""

""I'm Judite.""

""Nice to meet you. Come, let me show you where everything is."" There was a new shipment of books that needed to be sorted, both by category and alphabetical order. The task seemed like easy drudgery, so once Dalila took her stack and left the main room, Judite lapsed into her imagination. It happened with no effort, no awareness. She'd only spent a minute as Oxana before realizing that she'd been filing the books away into random slots on the shelf in front of her. By then, she couldn't remember which books were new and which had been there before. She panicked and called Dalila back over.

""Sorry,"" Judite said.

""Don't worry. It's your first day.""

Judite was soon lost, unable to keep track of which categories were in which rooms and what order the rooms were in, so she quietly attached herself to Dalila. She needed to scrutinize every title, cover, and jacket blurb, since the books had been packaged out of order. Dalila, however, did her part automatically, almost without looking at the books at all. Judite felt she should apologize for her slowness, but withheld herself. ""When did you start working here?"" she asked instead.

""Last year. I do different jobs each year. Sometimes two or three at once.""

""For the experience or the money?""

""The money. It doesn't help that much, but it does cover day-to-day things like groceries and the bus.""

That little key turned a lock inside Judite, and she was tempted to tell Dalila things she'd normally have been ashamed to admit aloud—how she also came from fewer means than the people she'd gone to school with, how there was an invisible yet impenetrable wall between her and everyone else. Nonetheless, she held her tongue.

Dalila kept talking to her as she worked, asking her what she was studying and what she wanted to do after she graduated. Having to speak as Judite, in addition to the focus that the work required, kept her in her own head. But she was only at the library a few hours a week. Whenever she wasn't, she had no reason to be Judite—it was Oxana with the house and the money and the husband. Oxana was still the cushion she needed during her two-hour commutes, during the short and restless nights, or when her parents were fighting and she had nowhere else to go. As she and Dalila normally had the library to themselves, they spent most of their time together in conversation. Judite felt that she was having to tap into a lobe of her brain she'd never used before. She didn't think herself interesting enough to be worthy of all Dalila's questions, but she'd waited all her life for the opportunity to unfold herself, so she took it. Dalila unfolded for her in turn: she had five siblings, her father lived in a different part of the city (because of work, not a divorce), and she'd never gone to university but had always wanted to. Months passed. Dalila began to treat Judite in a way no one had in a long time: taking her out to lunch, inviting her to her house, giving her gifts on her birthday. Judite also had an easy openness with her—she could speak without mincing words, without fear of oversharing. When she was with Dalila, she sometimes remembered the only other real friend she'd had. In primary school, she'd met an almost mythical girl, who shared most of Judite's interests, understood her humor, and never pitied her house or her clothes. They had remained in contact for over five years until she disappeared, never messaging Judite again. In Judite's dream world she manifested as Alyona, Oxana's childhood friend, who had one day moved to a faraway city without warning. Since then, Judite had been all the more content to dream about Oxana and her unchanging friends; she saved thoughts of Alyona for the lonely nights, when she needed a release but couldn't cry for herself, only for Oxana.

The seasons had almost come full circle: it was autumn again, and Judite was entering her final year of university. She'd barely spoken to Dalila in the past week, even over the phone. Every time she'd brought her finger to the dial button, she'd imagined Dalila busy on the other side—working, or maybe talking to people she liked better, less complicated people. Judite knew that real people weren't like Oxana's friends, eternally ready and waiting. So just as she was about to make the call she would always withdraw, retreat into her mind where it was safer, where she could be certain she was wanted and had a place. Judite had never been anyone's first priority; Oxana was.

When she entered the library, Dalila looked more worried than Judite had ever seen her. ""Hey … did I do something wrong?""

""What do you mean?"" Judite replied.

""I feel like you've been distant these past few days."" She paused and added, almost to herself, ""Although, I guess you always have been … ""

""Been what?""

""I don't know. Quiet. I always see you staring off into space like there's a whole little world in your head. But now it seems different. Like you've been avoiding me.""

""It's just that I know you have a lot going on, and I didn't … well, I guess I didn't want to distract you,"" Judite said, even though she had picked up the phone countless times. How could she tell Dalila that she was in competition with imaginary people?

""You're not a distraction. I like talking to you. Did I make it seem that way?""

""No, it's not your fault. It's just … to be honest, I was afraid that you might be getting bored of me. And I know you must have other friends.""

""What? Don't you think I'd have told you if that was the case?""

""Maybe you wouldn't have wanted to hurt my feelings. You're like that sometimes."" As she spoke, Judite's face began to burn, and her eyes filled with tears. Dalila walked up and hugged her tightly.

""I'll tell you,"" she said. ""I'll tell you. If there's ever a problem, I’ll tell you. If something happens, I swear I'll tell you.""

""You swear?""

""I would never just ditch you without saying anything. Who do you think I am?"" She laughed as if the very idea was ridiculous, and Judite turned toward her and cried into her shirt. They may have only been words, but she realized that no one had offered her that much before. Even Alyona had never promised such a thing.

For the first time in a long time, Judite's mind was blank as she rode the bus home. She saw with her own eyes. She'd never wanted to live in Lithuania; she'd just wanted to have somewhere to go that was far away from home. And she'd never wanted to be married; she'd just wanted someone stable and constant, someone who loved her and would never leave. Somewhere in the rear of her mind, Oxana was still moving, living her one day of life on repeat, but Judite wasn't there with her.",1,1754177577.0,stories,0,1.0,False

In february 2022 I have a big angina with big pain and sore throat, the worst I ever had, it took 3 weeks to get better more or less. 
Some times after this episode, I started noticing a lymph node swollen in neck right side under the jaw, more or less the same area where I had this big angina.
I had several ultra sound check which were normal. At first it was the only symptoms, sometimes it was painful, sometimes not but it was there anytimes (also it is movable, it is not fixed).
Now, 2 years after the area around is painful when touched, like inflammated and recently I start feeling discomfort and pain (little pain, not really painful but more like really concerning me) when swallowing. Two other node appeared in the area.

I also had pain and little discomfort in sinus on right side that appeared 6 month ago, still more or less present, but not as strong as it was when it appeared. Not so embarrasing but maybe linked? I don't know.

What really bother me now is that it is evolving, at first it was just swollen now it is a little painful when swallowing. Also I can feel a steong pain when i put my finger deep in my neck behind the node, under the jaw, I have to look for it but eventually i touch a little something, like maybe another little node (i dont know) and this one is really painful when i make it move. Maybe the pain comes from it i don't know. 

A detail, I really feel it when intense exercice like sprint, and when I drink coffee.

Here is what i mean… Kenny is a true professional in every facet. For example, early in his career he worked with the notoriously difficult John Mellencamp.

Early on when Kenny joined the band they went into record one of their first albums and John didn’t have the time or money to screw around in the studio so he basically fired Kenny and got a studio drummer. 

Jon broke the news and gave him a plane ticket home. Kenny refused it. Instead of being upset about not being on the record, he said no I’m not going home. I’m going to stay here and learn from these session drummers if they’re so great i need to be a part of it because im still YOUR drummer and if i get better, YOU will be better 

So for the next month, he humbled himself and was the go to guy for coffee and other bullshit, while he watched and learned. 

Smart and full of humility. 

He later went on to record the famous drum solo in Jack and Diane as well as playing with literally hundreds of other artists over 30 years. 

I just read his book ….the story about him being introduced to a drum machine is pretty cool as well

"" then fulbrite angryly said ""ha CAN A TROLL EVEE TRUELY CHANGE THERE WAYS"" 

 I LIKE THIS LINE TOO. phoenix manages to write kind of in character since this is the same type of shit that he says about simon blackquill but passive aggressively

""fulbright: IN JUSTISE WE TGRUST THERES NO WAY HE JERK IN VIRTUAL BOY""

good line

i think its funny how between this and 5s hes one of the few characters off the top of my head who actually ever gives a shit about justice iirc hes sparkleng justice parody kind of. its mildly humerous in the sens e of ace attorney

""""im kind of docter"" said fulbright ""i taght athen cykes to perform surgeon""

""""IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL PARDNER"" ""ITS A PIESE OF SHIT"" said fulbright ""

  
GAHHHHHH this is probably the funniest prison gaeems 4 line im taken back to 2023 nostaliga childhood reading this like critic chef rattatoautie why did makar and phoenix evilly force me to write this to slightly higher the chance of other characters die NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

""""LAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WTF"" said yew laghing ""WTGF"" said godot and he spit on flore "" I HATE BEING SMALL I CANT DRINKL COFFEE OR I WILL DROWN I CAN ONLY BE IN EMPTY COFE CUPS I CANT SPIT PROPERLEY"" then marshall and gant held the shit in the are laghing proud of there baby""

this isnt bobby but im crying laughing at fucking stercus and this is the turning point for bobby character

""""OK FUCKING STOP IN JUSTISE WE TRUST THATS NOT A BABERY THATS A SHIT"" said fulbright with so much angry ""GIVE DIPER AND POKING HOLES IN IT TO GIVE IT A FAKE MOUTH AND EYES WONT MAKE IT A BABEY U FUCKING WEIRDOS ITS STILL SHIT"" said fulbrite ""WOW"" said clarisa ""what a non conformist babny i think the babey will grow up too be so cool"" ""yes"" said marshall ""hes name is stercus its a cool name"" said gant ""its hi class name like my offise"" ""UGHHHHHHHHHHH this IS PISS ME OFF ITS STARTING TOO MAKE ME TRUST JUSTISE LESS"" said fulbrite""

**PART TWO OK THE GROUDWORK IS DONE I KNOW WHAT TO RIGHTA ABOUT AFTER REFRESHING MEMEORY**

stercus biggest contribution is making bobbby fucking evil and turn evil character arc i think bobby's arc is kind of startlingly coherent for the character so far with multi game arcs which is about like idk 10 ish characters so far 

theres kind of a hilarious dramatic irony to it completely on accident (dramatic irony in the sense that pg4 and pg5s released at the same time alternating for the most part), in chapter 2 of pg4 its well set up that hes isolated by the other police guys in swimming pool accident

he gets troled for the next few chapters then is pissed off at shit baby which makes him trust justice less then the badaass INJUSTICE we trust then in prison games 4 ending he becomes phantorm and he is persecuted for BEIG DEMEN

""yea"" said fulbright ""i have no sole im a demen"" ""i was hired by satan 2 come here and leed u all astray"" ""i did that by doing fucking nothing other then offering a apple""  (funny line interlude)

then in pg5s SIMILER SCENARIO to prrison games 4 case 2 where police people are aall hanging out the pool, this turn him ridiculous angrey, and in case 2 aafter the bullshit murder that starts case 1 he immediately kills in case 2 and is fucking forgot about for 5 chapters until COMES BACK pg5s-6 solely to try to kill gant who pissed him off with shit baby and this is during right after when gant overcame his FATHER and bobby hates his SONE and there is surely something to be said i just think its funny.

thats basically alll of the ""analys"" i can for for fucking fantem

**PART THREE** 

pg5s is ok i went over the important but  funny lines time

""in justice we thrust""

""fuck off motherfucker im pressing charges"" said dahlia



bobby: wahhhhh and he cried like he was adhd



at breakfast patricia was baking with her foxes put ritalin in bobby food shut him up

  
""bobby: i beleave in a realety were we can all swim togethre in peave and rehabilite""

  
ok now lets pretend that bobby has  coherent              arc (true information)            does this line mean he regreted it???? did the swimulation rehabiliate his sole??????????? but then he SAD relapses on his arc like fucking. peko or other character with danganronpa sad arc cut hsort

  
""  
bobby: theires ppl like artistle who have a idea and other ppl who have diffarant idea, thats whats so difficalt about philospy in general

""""

  
i like that ""bobby is innicent"" is a swim bullet. truly revolutionary mystery writing

him being mistaken as victim i think (skimming this so fucking hard) is kind of good for his charact they have to all feel bad for him and they have to trust in justice if they trust in justice then they to get themselves kkill but if they dont trust hes iller

  
""boby: fine i admit it

THEN BOBY TEAR OFF ZIPPER AND HE WAS THE GORILLA FROM SPUNCH BOB AND THEN HE TEAR APART JOCK SPORTSMAN IN HALF LIKE HE WAS FREAKING SPUNCH BOB THEN BEAT UP BOBBY AND PUT CALITSO YEW AND BLAISE IN A BAG AND WAS RIDE INTO SUNSDT OM A DONKEY

THEN TV TURN OFF AND CAMMY AND KATHERINE REVEL TO BE WATCHING 5S S""

  
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH uhf-4 foreshadowign

  
**ENDING**

he probably the closest to being the rip lacer out of any character which is essentially just code for any character that pretends to be other characters...... tigre, twogami, mia fey, and you can even infer that tsumugi is also a rip lacer. theres a secret rip lacer to in ytts somewhat. rip lacers peal is obviously victimrompa and 5s finale so to keep serparate i didnt mention. the bulk of this ""anal"" is in the middle of the postt

  
**WHY I DIDNT CUT THE REST**

tigre: tigre ive liked enough to bring him back in pg3 and in plta again as idfk fucki bookends because i always found him kind of funny i am less for reusing characters but i like him that much as the first killer and have always been a fan. plta-5 is probably one of my better chapters mostly the murder plan but afforadable housing is kind of funny and execution and etcetra i guess. 

calisto: pg2 she is ok kind of boring there is one gag that is spread across her and other iconic character shih na (thats the gag) in pg4 this is kind of address in pg4 she is really good protag i think shes funny and laugh a bunch at her mostly toward the begiing but also a lot towards the end in the middle of pg4 i dont remember to much. lotso f fumbassary if phoenix is nominating then ok

atmey: i think now is a reasonable time for atmey to go which is kind of insane he survives pg1 hes the only pg1 survivor to do anything in uhf he basically nearly survives pg5s which is fucked up. makar is the biggest 3-2 fan planet earth so if he wants him to go then ok ill nominate him when its time

vilen: i didnt like him in pg3 that much but i stuck around with him. i think he bounces off off nichedge well as a therapist figure and the mental image of him with banana is kind of funny. i dont remember barely any thing from the ftes sorry but i think his death in uhf-5 is well timed

kokichi: i felt kkoichi was underbaked in victimrompa as was a lot of the cast in a way but in a funny way. i think the relevance he has in survivor is satisfactory enough being one half of a kind of funny chapter and does some stuff near the end i wouldnt be too upset if he was gone",3,1754177160.0,prisongames,0,1.0,False

Weird grief feelings coming back bc i don’t want to be her or get married at all.

I just found out my ex is getting married today.

We dated for 6 years, had a dog together, and moved states together. The girl he is marrying is who I felt like he had eyes for once we moved. He is 28 and she is 22… Like the whole thing just feels fucking odd. This girl also had added me on facebook during the time we were breaking up. 
Broke up march 2023
He contacted me to get coffee after this girl had broken up with him in November 2023. I told him to kick rocks. I guess i’m not sure what happened in between now and then. 
They were engaged in April of this year, married today. It just is such an odd feeling, I wouldn’t want to be her, but it more so sucks that it feels like I spent so much time with him and he told me he wasn’t sure if he wanted to marry me, which is why we broke up. and he was able to commit to this girl quickly. Idk. I just feel vindicated that I had a feeling to be right about this girl. ",1,1754177136.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

It had been over two decades since I had been to Zion Holy Fire Assemblies of God, but I could never forget how to find it deep in the hills off highway 60. There was a new building now, across the road from the old one. They kept the Sunday school and the fellowship hall at the original location, and they held Sunday services in the new sanctuary.

Danielle had been shocked when I told her I was going to church, but I didn’t care. For once, she didn’t try to stop me from going somewhere. Even her mother seemed happy to help with childcare if it meant I was finding my faith again, and even if it meant my faith was a different denomination from the church Danielle normally attended with her family. 

But I wasn’t looking for faith. Not my own, anyway.

The parking lot was full. A couple kids played outside of the old building, chasing each other in and out of the overgrown peony bushes lining the wall. 

Since I was late for service, I stayed in my car and nervously drank the energy drink I’d picked up at the gas station. I had to piss, but I didn’t want to go inside. Not yet. I wasn’t here for service and didn’t want to get sucked into worship. 

I’d done my time in those crowds, pretending to raise my hands like the Holy Spirit had possessed my weary vessel. I had dutifully sung along to the same five contemporary songs with the same chord progression, week in and week out. I’d endured plenty of prayer lines and healings and seen my fair share of old women collapse on the ground, slain in the Spirit, as they called it. I’d passed out modesty cloths and helped cover those same old women so that their upturned skirts didn’t reveal their floral bloomers while they lay on the carpet. 

I wanted no part in all of that – the masturbatory public displays of holiness. I didn’t want the feigned celebrations and laying on of hands and murmuring of the regular members, the *“God is good”*s and *“Praise Him in the mighty Name”*s. But I did need to talk to Ol’ Son Roberts, named so because he was the son of… well, Daddy Roberts.

Son was a deacon of Zion Holy Fire, and he was the only clergyman I’d ever trusted. “Clergyman,” to be fair, was a bit of a stretch and not a fully adequate description. He was a kind man, real and rough as horse hide. He lived on a generations-old goat farm, ran a cash-only body shop out of his shed, and worked evenings as an elementary school janitor. 

If there is a God, only Ol’ Son Roberts ever speaks to Him.

Worship and subsequent prayer tends to go long past the scheduled hour at Zion Holy Fire, and a certain type of person revels in that. For all of his patience and genuine faith, Son is not that type. Whoever was the preacher now, they were surely circling the sanctuary, microphone in hand, whacking teenage girls in the head with a Bible (a little too fervently) and spitting furiously into the faces of the prayer team to the sound of synthesized church organ. 

But Son, I knew, would have made his way out to the lobby for his third or fourth coffee of the morning, and he’d be there until it was time to lock up or carry baked goods over to the fellowship hall. 

I found him right where I always had, when I’d taken up drinking coffee with him just to have an excuse to dip out of worship. And like no time had passed since we last spoke, Ol’ Son Roberts simply grinned and handed me a styrofoam coffee cup from the folding table he was leaning against. He was even wearing the same plaid button-up, tucked into the same khakis, which in turn were tucked into the same cowboy boots he’d had on the last time I’d seen him.

“Well, mornin’ to you, Mr. Bledsoe,” he called out. His voice was raspy as ever, despite having given up smoking in 1987.

“Howdy, Son,” I replied. “How’s it going?” I winced at the fact that I could hear myself putting on an affectation of the mountain drawl of my youth.

“Heard you got yourself a young’in,” Son said, matter-of-factly. 

Family life gets around like that, in the holler. Getting married, making babies, getting throwed in the drunk tank, getting shot at for screwing your neighbor’s daughter in the drug store parking lot. Those kinds of things tend to make their rounds to every household by noon the previous Tuesday.

“Name’s Jericho,” I said.

“Good name. Boy, I suppose?”

I nodded. 

“You never know, these days,” Son said, grinning. I forced myself to grin back. “What brings you back into the Lord’s house, Heath?”

Just like that. No matter how meandering the conversation seemed to be, not much time was ever wasted. Clever bastards, these good old hill folk. “I was looking for you, actually,” I answered. 

“Oh?” he said, without so much as lifting an eyebrow. He sipped his coffee, and through the closed sanctuary doors echoed the sounds of women wailing in divine ecstasy and young worship leaders belting out their practiced praises and displays of shameless piety.

I paused for a minute, filling my cup with coffee and still needing to take a leak. “You have anywhere to be after service?” I asked.

Son pursed his lips and stroked his wiry goatee. “Naw, not today. What do you need, Heath?”

Behind the thick-rimmed spectacles that Son had worn for forty years, I could see the concern in his eyes. He’d been kind to me when my mom died, and I’d spent a whole summer on his couch after my senior year of high school. 

“Just prayer, I think.”

That seemed to surprise Son.

“What’s troubling you?”

I looked around, painfully aware of the young nursing mother seated on a bench nearby, babe in arms and breastfeeding blanket draped over one shoulder. I thought of Danielle and swallowed some building saliva. 

“Rather not say here,” I said. 

“Trouble with the missus?” 

I started at that, on edge as I was. That slight hesitation was all it took to confirm Son’s suspicions, and he simply leaned back and gulped down the dregs of his coffee. “Alright then,” he grunted, and he thumped his huge palm on my shoulder as he walked past me and continued out the door.

I followed, not knowing what else to do. At least someone seemed to have a plan. 

Son unlocked both doors of his old Dodge pickup, the same truck he’d had my whole life. I climbed into the passenger side, and Son was already starting her up and peeling out. I suddenly wished I’d taken my one opportunity to use the bathroom. 

“You’ve got a troubled look about you, boy,” he finally said as we pulled out onto the nearly empty highway a few minutes later. “What’s this about?”

There was no use beating around the bush with a man like this. I’d sought him out, hadn’t I?

“I’m being stalked by a demon, I think.” 

I studied the old chiseled face, but there was no perceptible reaction. That revelation was not a shock to him.

“And what’s that got to do with your wife?”

“I never said it had anything to do with her,” I said, defensive. 

“You ain’t have to,” Son said in return. 

I didn’t speak for a few minutes. I began to sweat and had to roll down the passenger window with a squeaky hand crank. My voice cracked when I even thought about making some kind of confession, but part of me hoped there might be relief in telling someone trustworthy about what I’d done, or what I feared I had done. 

I thought for a moment that Son was going to tell me something and give me an out, but he merely pulled into the gravel turnoff for a decrepit Civil War cemetery and turned off the truck. When I still couldn’t find the words, he got out, strolled over to an illegibly-weathered headstone, and took a seat. 

I gathered the courage to join him, looking over my shoulder the whole while and wondering if I’d begin hearing those dreadful tambourines any second. Only the Canadian Geese migrating overhead and the distant sound of tires on some far off road echoed through the still gravestones. 

I was about to burst with piss, but I sat down in the grass beside the old deacon, not wanting to look him in the eye.

“I’ll pray, but you got to tell her, Heath.”

I hung my head in my hands, and I wept. 

“Almighty Father,” Son began, “You let this boy know he has the strength.” I sobbed at that, as I hadn’t in many years. What strength? My wife had no respect for me, and why should she? I was worthless, and had invited calamity upon our household, so it seemed. For all the hard lessons life had dealt me, I had failed to learn anything. “Give him guidance, Jesus, to follow Your will and find his way back to what he needs to be doing.”

Son continued to pray under his breath for a minute or so, rubbing my back like I imagined a loving father would. Son had been a father, once. Shame he hadn’t been mine. For me, anyway. 

“I just want Jericho safe,” I pleaded. Son nodded. 

“You ain’t let nothin’ touch that baby,” Son told God. “I know you won’t.”

\*\*

Son and I parted ways before lunch. He went on to visit his niece and her many children, and I went on back home, where I belonged. I made promises to invite him up sometime, to reconnect, and he made assurances that I was always welcome back on that same couch I’d slept on as a teenager. 

But I did not do what was right. Danielle wanted more baby wipes and coffee and cereal and eggs from the store, and then there was the small bit of grass we had that needed mowing. Not a good time, I told myself. Maybe whatever was tickling my ears at odd hours would go away. Maybe I had imagined it all, and maybe a believing man like Ol’ Son Roberts could scare it off, if it was real and if God was real. 

It did not go away. It returned that night, and every night hence. But it did not, for what it was worth, return to Jericho’s room. The song simply played its merry and its treacherous melodies, its reminders to my soul that I was not alone and could never be. That I was not to have peace in my sleep or in my waking hours, either. 

The three-legged demon, or ghost, or interdimensional extraterrestrial, whatever I could imagine it to be, did not return for some time. There were a few instances in which I thought I could smell a faint electric burning in the air, that foul ozone on my clothes or lingering in my wake as I went about my days, but there was nothing else tangible on Monday, or on Tuesday. Only the playful taunting of the song.

On Wednesday morning, I was finally able to see a psychiatrist in Knoxville who specialized in hallucinations and schizophrenia. She performed various screens and asked me about stressors, trauma, substance abuse – the usual suspects. She indicated to me that I did not seem to be suffering from some delusional malady. Her tentative diagnosis was that the music I was supposedly hearing was a stress-induced hallucination, or some potential neurological complication brought on by a lack of sleep with the newborn in the home. 

I didn’t tell her about the three-legged creature or its ozone breath. I didn’t tell her that I had begun to detect strange repeating rhythms in the song of the lute and the alien woodwind. I didn’t tell her that those patterns had begun to coalesce into something like an intelligible message. And I certainly didn’t tell her that the intelligible message seemed to be uncannily intimate, or that it wanted to speak to Danielle and Jericho.

The psychiatrist referred me to a neurologist and helped me set up an appointment for a CT scan, in case I was experiencing symptoms of a tumor or even a stroke.

When I returned to the familiar stomping grounds of our small, two-stoplight West Virginian town, I made a detour and stopped by the BitBar International office. 

Adding “International” to the incorporated name had been a deliberate, if grandiose, way to manifest the future success of our startup. We wanted to revolutionize liquor sales and distribution by fractionalizing digital ownership and leveraging cryptocurrency trading boards, or some other meaningless jargon like that. I barely remember. But we did have designs for real bottles that would act as physical tokens. Real altruistic, salt of the earth work we were doing.

I wasn’t stopping to work on BitBar app development, though. I wanted to finalize my CT scan appointment and see if I could figure out what was covered by my insurance, and I wanted to do so in peace without Danielle’s prying eyes or the expectation that I would be interrupted to help with Jericho every time anything at all happened. 

I had not intended to hook up with Maria. I didn’t tell her I would be there, and had hardly even texted her at all this whole week. It was just serendipitous, really, that she arrived half an hour after I did. Maybe she saw me on the security feed she had on her phone and decided to come over, maybe not. 

But there she was, her keys jingling in the front door of the unit and her short gym shorts riding up nearly to her pelvis, leaving not a whole lot to the imagination. Her black hair was in a ponytail and enough of her midriff was showing in the tight little top she wore to raise the dead. Dressed like she was about to go for a run. Damn, she looked good. I didn’t notice until later, but she had makeup on. 

“Where were you this morning?” she asked, and she walked right to the mini fridge beside where I was sitting at the conference table. She leaned over and got herself a water bottle, and I took in the view – which was, of course, the point of the whole exercise. At least, I flattered myself by assuming that it was.

“Doctor appointment,” I said. “Checkup,” I added, to dispel concerns. Last thing I wanted to do was go into detail about my affliction.

We didn’t tend to keep any regular hours. Maria had three other employees, but they were contract. I was the only salaried employee, and our understanding had included a loose and forgiving schedule. Like I said, startup. 

“I was hoping I’d see you this morning. Bailey and Norm are both out of town. I’ve been here all alone *all day*,” she said, adding a flair of exasperation to that last part.

She sat on the table and peered down at my laptop. That made it hard to concentrate. I switched to a tab related to my actual workload and pretended to adjust some numbers. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*.

I ignored the tambourines. 

“Did we ever get that credit back on our account with those server hosting people?” I asked, trying desperately to fight… what? What was I fighting, exactly?

Maria brushed past my mundane work questions. “I don’t know why I even dress up to come in here all alone,” she said.

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*. 

“I think you look just fine like that,” I countered, my head gesturing vaguely toward her body. 

The lute player tucked a string, or two or three. 

Maria’s eyes were honed in on my own. Her lower lip was just barely pouting, ever so slightly. Enough to override the devil’s flute whistling through whatever tied me to this conscious plane. 

“You didn’t talk to me much this week,” Maria said. She paused, waiting for me to pick up there. 

I didn’t know what to say. I could barely think over the escalating woodwind, the otherworldly gasping in and out, in and out. The song wallowed in the moment. 

“I wanted to,” I said, and I knew it sounded flimsy and pathetic. “Jericho’s had me up every night.”

Maria didn’t retreat or slow her advance. She leaned in, in fact. Her head tilted down so that her eyes seemed to be looking up at me, pleading. 

“Does Dani know?”

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka.* 

The lute and the woodwind rested, waiting for my answer. 

“No,” I said. I couldn’t force myself to look away from those eyes, those deep black wells of unfathomable mystery in which all but the bravest are lost.

Maria’s hand brushed mine. A probe, a dabbling in the waters to see if I was pulling back. I wasn’t. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka.*

“Are you going to tell her?” she asked. 

Her finger was warm and soft where it rested against my forearm. “Do you want me to?” I asked in return.

Maria’s pout protruded further, and she blinked, as though she hadn’t thought about that. I knew she had. 

“I figured maybe it wasn’t a good time. With the baby.”

“It’s not,” I said.

The woodwind whistled its low bass hum once, then twice, then thrice and thrice again.

Maria leaned in further, and I surprised her by reaching around to the back of her bare neck and pulling her face into mine. The surprise turned to surrender in an instant. Our lips met, then our tongues. Our eyes were closed in rapture as though witnessing our sin was a pleasure for which we were not yet deserving.

I heard – or felt, or sensed in some other way – the stomping of those infernal hooves, their spiraling approach to the forefront of my attention. Maria’s top was on the floor, my jeans were tossed on the back of a chair. 

I ignored the rattling of chains, the turning of wheels following just behind the three-legged footsteps. What other new instruments of torture would be added to my symphony? Lust overpowered any trepidation I might have had. 

We went on, as lovers do. Barriers came down, one step further and then another until there were few lines we had not crossed. All the while, the song played its gleeful tune, and the three-legged demon circled. And circled.

Until at last it stopped trodding, because it could come no closer.

The blistering steam of the spirit’s breath whipped over my neck and back, sizzled against my skin. I paid it little mind and kept on with my endeavor, fighting past the ozone smell of my anima writhing in electric pain. I was spite and I performed for an audience, daring it to watch me have my way.

I saw in my mind Dani, the joint smoldering in her hand as we stood across from each other in Austin’s basement. We were laughing at something nineteen-year-olds laugh at. I don’t recall what. I could only think about how pretty she was with those mouse-brown curls. The years I was in college and supported only by her waitressing. The summer I moved into her parents’ spare bedroom, and the afternoons when we would hurry and make out while her dad was mowing the lawn. Sitting on her bed and watching Breaking Bad together on the crackling CRTV. Going to the music festival in Philly and getting sick from food truck gyros. Our honeymoon in Maine… Dani. 

Maria and I heaved sighs of release and panted in the heavy stillness of a cold and silent conference room. My neck and back bristled in numb aching beneath the still-rising steam, as though the nerve endings of my skin had been cauterized. I made no move to get up from the conference table.

It should go without saying, but I have not been fair to Dani in this recounting of events. I have painted her in a poor light to justify my own misgivings. The color of my love must be wicked.

The song of the Carriage Lecher was silent, or off to taunt some other hapless moron. The chains, though, echoed somewhere in the distance. Had I remembered, even then in my ignorance, what that meant? Did I know the Lecher by name through some subconscious recollection?

Danielle would be at the house with Jericho now, alone. Her mother had been there all morning, but I had ignored a handful of texts updating me about their status. *“I need help with Jericho’s bath so I can get my hair done, Heath. Where are you?”* 

I grew weary of the upkeep of whatever semblance of marital duty I was pretending to maintain. 

\*\* 

When I later showered at home, I was not at all confused to see the markings on my back in the mirror where the three-legged specter had breathed upon me. The redness of my dead skin formed fractals of spiraling, repeating patterns, from the base of my spine to the nape of my neck. There was no feeling, there, wherever the markings touched. Only a faint pull, a tugging that had no effect on my mortal stride or my balance. It only served to orient me in some ethereal sense.

I became accustomed to early morning diaper changes and every other mundane task done to the tune of the damned fairy song. The chains and the clattering of the hooves sank into background noise, ever present, but never again going near my Jericho. 

Nor, it seemed, could I go near him. Oh sure enough I held him, rocked him, carried him around in a sling while I cooked and cleaned, but I was not present for those moments; could no longer remember seeing his smiles and or watch his bright blue eyes discovering the wonder of the world. I couldn’t hear the sounds of his babbling or his first laugh over the braying of the lute and the woodwind. Over the clatter of the tambourines.

Next Tuesday came, and my trip to Baltimore with Maria seemed a pointless venture. Still, I went, and I took some pleasure in the obscene carousing she and I got up to on the drive. We both got off a handful of times on the road through Virginia, and we made jokes about being pulled over and scrambling to zip up our pants before getting caught by the highway patrol.

Danielle texted a few times and even called once. Did she have an inclination of my treachery?

I can’t even tell you how our meeting with Gary’s investor buddy went, other than the fact that it was successful. Everything I did seemed to be successful, lately. Everything seemed to go my way. I charmed others, worked like a madman, tirelessly, over the sound of the song. 

Instead of the hotel bar, Maria and I went clubbing that night. That, I remember. 

I remember because I heard something familiar from the street. We had walked what seemed like most of the city – the part where you won’t likely get shot, anyway – hopping between one night spot and the next. We walked past Patterson Park and through Highlandtown, and then all at once it was like I woke up.

The lute and the woodwind had stopped. The tambourines hadn’t, or so I thought. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*. 

But that wasn’t a pair of tambourines. It was bass rumbling through the brick facade of a small venue off the main street, tucked away and obscured in the cul de sac of a repurposed industrial complex. 

*Sha Qi*, said the building, with its single purple backlit sign. Beside that were the Chinese characters transliterating the name.

I had already started for the entrance to the venue and was almost a block off the main boulevard by the time Maria caught up with me and asked where I was going. But I wasn’t listening to her. 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*.

It was in the real world, that familiar rhythm. I felt it through my feet. It rumbled Baltimore.

The bouncer gave us no trouble, just a five dollar cover charge. It was not a popular club, by any means, and drew no substantial crowd. There was a fog machine running in the tenebrous purple lighting of the interior, and a handful of patrons stood around at their hightop cocktail tables and gently swayed with the beat. 

Maria was still struggling to catch up in her stilettos. I told her what to order for me at the bar so she would be occupied for a few moments, and she did as I asked with only a moment’s hesitation. 

I had seen what I was looking for: a DJ. 

There was no one in my way as I wound my way up the stage ramp and around the DJ booth to look the man in the eye. His oversized leather coat and the portable signage behind him read *Big Money OLAS: Our Lord and Savior.* 

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka*.

Big Money OLAS – I’ll call him OLAS for short – leaned back and folded his arms. He wore sunglasses, even in the near darkness of the *Sha Qi* interior, but I felt his eyes lock onto my own. 

“Is this music yours?” I asked over the bumping of the bass. It wasn’t long before a heavily modified flute melody began playing over the beat. Even in comparison to the woodwind it mimicked, the overproduced track felt crass.

“Course it’s mine,” he said. “Original.”

The song was not identical to the haunting one I heard nearly all hours of the day, now, but its flavor was there. Undeniably.

“Did you hear it somewhere?” I asked.

“You forget where you know it, huh?” OLAS continued to look me up and down for a moment, and then he turned back to his equipment and adjusted a fader. “When you start hearing it?” 

I paused, and swallowed a mouthful of unwelcome saliva. There was no reason to hold back. “I cheated on my wife.” I gestured back toward the bar without turning to look and see exactly where Maria was. “With that woman I’m with now. My boss.”

“Oh he gotcha good, huh?” OLAS didn’t laugh, but there was amusement in his voice. He lifted his sunglasses away from his eyes and tucked them into his hair so he could look at me better. “She a fine piece, at least?”

“*Who* got me?” I asked, my voice growing hoarse from shouting over OLAS’ bumping music. 

OLAS leaned in close, and I almost backed away but thought better of it. I had to hear what this guy had to say. “Where I’m from, we call him the Carriage Lecher,” OLAS said. For the first time, I caught a deep southern accent in his voice. As in, delta swamp, deep. 

“I don’t know who the hell that–” I grunted, and then I corrected myself. 

I heard the chains rattling behind me, just as they rattled behind the footsteps of a three-legged beast of burden. I felt the weight of the carriage tugging at us both, tugging through those taut chains. I had known, I realized, who it was that followed in a minstrel stagecoach. I recalled the smell of blackberry and vanilla in that plush red carriage. Or was that Maria I smelled?

I asked a better question. “Why me?”

“He calls you home,” OLAS growled, so gutturally that I first thought he might be choking. “You sealed a covenant long before you were spat out into that body.”

I stood still, as if in a trance, for a good several seconds. I had not consented to any such covenant. But maybe I had. The numb patch of marked skin on my back came to my mind, and I saw in that vision that the patterns spun like interlocking gears in a mephistophelian machine. 

“Is he a demon?” I finally asked. 

“Ain’t no angels. Ain’t no demons.” OLAS said. “Only us.”

I wasn’t sure what he meant. I must have looked bewildered, an expression exaggerated by the fact that I was already fairly tipsy and squinting through bleary eyes in the haze of the fog machine. 

“It’s who we always been, and will be.” With that, Big Money OLAS slapped my shoulder, forcefully enough to stagger me. There was something in it like the fatherly slap of Ol’ Son Roberts, but without the mirth. He pulled his shades back over his fresh-blacktop eyes and turned the volume dial on his control board up a few notches. 

A new track began to play on OLAS’ playlist, but I could no longer hear any music from the club’s sound system. I could only hear the lonely, nocturne lament of an other-worldly woodwind. Howling, then whistling, then shrieking in celebration of my remembrance.

*We knew you were not fit to father, Mr. Bledsoe,* it said to me with its lilting tune, and it laughed. *Our procession is no place for wife and child. Are you sure you don’t want to bring them with you?*

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Padres vs. Cardinals: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**  
*Where Baseball Meets Absurdity*

The San Diego Padres (-135) and St. Louis Cardinals (+113) clash in a matchup that’s part baseball, part math puzzle, and part “why is Randy Vasquez’s name a verb?” Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB closer and the humor of a解说员 who’s had one too many nachos.

---

### Odds & Stats: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Padres are favored at -135, implying a 57.4% chance to win. For the Cardinals (+113), their implied probability is 47.2%. Combined, that’s 104.6%—because bookmakers love to overcharge for math. San Diego’s 60% win rate as a short favorite is solid, while St. Louis’s 49.1% underdog success rate is just… okay.

Offensively, the Padres rank 11th in MLB batting average (.250), but they’re a home-run-challenged bunch (struggling with HRs despite Fernando Tatis Jr.’s best efforts). The Cardinals, meanwhile, have a 4.18 ERA (19th) and a WHIP that’s higher than my patience for explaining baseball to a goldfish.

**Key Stat:** The total is set at 8.5 runs. With San Diego’s contact-heavy offense and St. Louis’s leaky bullpen, this game smells like a “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” remake—except the tiara is a run total, and they’re *definitely* going over.

---

### Injury Report: When Life Gives You Lemons…

* **Padres:** Luis Arraez is riding a hitting streak, which is impressive until you realize he’s basically a human coffee table—*everyone* trips over him. Randy Vasquez starts, and while his name sounds like a spell from *Harry Potter*, his ERA this season is… let’s just say it’s “magical” in the “I-accidentally-enchanted-my-socks” way.

**ACT III**

**INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING - 9:40 AM**

*The kitchen looks like a museum of good intentions. Dirty dishes crowd the sink in archaeological layers, evidence of Max's increasingly desperate attempts to coax life back into Chloe through food. The morning light filtering through the window feels harsh and unforgiving, illuminating the exhaustion etched into every line of Max's face.*

*This time, Max moves through her morning routine like a sleepwalker. There's no manic energy in her cooking, no desperate creativity. She scrambles eggs with mechanical precision, her movements hollow and automatic. The spark that had driven her frantic caretaking has guttered out, leaving behind only the muscle memory of caring.*

*She plates the food without her usual careful presentation, just eggs and toast on a plate, a glass of orange juice beside it. When she picks up the tray, her hands shake slightly, and she has to pause to steady herself against the counter.*

*The only time she tries to summon any brightness is when she pushes open the bedroom door.*

**MAX**   
(voice artificially light, like sunlight through dirty glass)  
Morning, sleepyhead. I made your favorite.

*Chloe sits up slowly, her movements underwater-languid. Her hair is a disaster of tangles, and there are dark circles under her eyes that make her look almost spectral.*

**CHLOE**   
Thanks.

*Max sets the tray down with exaggerated care, like she's handling explosives. She settles into the chair that's become her permanent post, watching as Chloe stares at the food with the same vacant expression she'd worn yesterday.*

**MAX**  
(desperate to fill the silence)  
The eggs are still warm. And I, uh, I buttered the toast the way you like it. Light on the edges, more in the middle.

*Chloe picks up the fork but doesn't use it immediately. She turns it over in her fingers, studying it like she's forgotten what it's for.*

**CHLOE**  
I know. You always remember.

*It should be sweet. Instead, it sounds like an accusation, or maybe just exhaustion. Chloe takes a small bite, chews mechanically, swallows with visible effort.*

**MAX**  
How'd you sleep?

**CHLOE**  
Fine.

**MAX**  
Any dreams?

**CHLOE**  
No.

*The conversation dies there, strangled by its own inadequacy. Max watches Chloe take three more bites before she sets the fork down with the finality of a closing door.*

**CHLOE**  
(apologetic but distant)  
I'm sorry. I'm just... not very hungry.

**MAX**  
(trying to keep the desperation out of her voice)  
You barely ate yesterday either. Maybe just a few more bites?

**CHLOE**  
(shaking her head)  
I can't. I'm sorry.

*Max forces a smile that feels like it might crack her face.*

**MAX**  
It's okay. I can save it for later if you want.

*But they both know she won't want it later. They both know this tray will join the others in the kitchen, another monument to Max's failing efforts.*

**INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

*Max takes the barely touched tray back to the kitchen, setting it down next to yesterday's lunch plate, which still sits exactly where she left it. The sight of all that uneaten food hits her like a physical blow to the stomach.*

*She stares at the congealing eggs, the toast growing cold and hard at the edges, the orange juice with its thin film of pulp. Her throat closes up. The smell that had seemed comforting while cooking now makes her nauseated.*

*Her hands grip the edge of the counter, knuckles white. She can feel something breaking inside her, a structural collapse that starts small and spreads.*

*Ok, this is it. She's done.*

*Max reaches for her phone with trembling fingers. She needs help. She needs someone who might know what to do when love isn't enough, when caring becomes a kind of drowning.*

**EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS**

*Max steps outside into the morning air, grateful for the bite of cold against her skin. She leans against Chloe's truck, the familiar blue paint sun-faded and comforting under her palm. The metal is cold enough to ground her, to remind her body where it ends and the world begins.*

*She scrolls through her contacts until she finds ""Mom & Dad."" Her finger hovers over the call button for a long moment. Once she makes this call, it becomes real. Once she admits she can't handle this alone, everything changes.*

*She hits the button.*

*The phone rings twice before Vanessa's voice fills the space, warm and concerned even across the distance.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice immediately alert)  
Max? Honey, it's early. Is everything okay?

**MAX**  
(voice smaller than she intended)  
Mom, dad...

*There's a rustling sound, voices conferring off the phone. Then Ryan's voice joins the call.*

**RYAN**  
We're both here, sweetheart. What's going on?

**MAX**  
I'm...

*The words stick in her throat. How do you explain that the person you love most in the world is disappearing in slow motion? How do you admit that all your care and devotion feel like water poured into sand?*

**RYAN**  
(voice gentle but firm)  
Honey, you okay? Talk to us.

**MAX**  
(the dam breaking)  
Uh, no. Not really.

**RYAN**  
What's wrong?

*Max takes a shaky breath, pressing her free hand against her forehead.*

**MAX**  
It's Chloe. She, uh... she won't eat, and she sleeps almost all the time, and...

*Her voice breaks, and she has to stop, gasping slightly.*

**MAX**  
(voice shaky, desperate)  
She had this terrible breakdown two nights ago and now I'm losing her all over again and I don't know what to do.

**VANESSA**  
(voice filled with immediate concern)  
My god, Max...

**MAX**  
(the words tumbling out now)  
I've been trying everything. I cook all her favorite foods and she barely touches them. I try to talk to her and she just... she's not there. It's like she's underwater and I can't reach her and I don't know how to help and I'm scared, I'm so scared that—

**RYAN**  
(cutting her off gently)  
Max. Breathe, honey. We're here.

*Max presses her back against the truck, sliding down until she's sitting on the curb. The concrete is cold and real beneath her.*

**MAX**  
(desperate, voice breaking)  
Could you, uh... come down here? I really feel like I'm losing my shit.

*There's a pause, the sound of muffled conversation. Max can hear her parents talking quickly to each other, making plans.*

**RYAN**  
(voice decisive)  
We'll be there by tomorrow morning, okay? We're leaving as soon as we can get packed.

**VANESSA**  
Max, honey—

**MAX**  
(cutting her off, almost crying)  
I'm sorry, I have to go now. Talk later.

*She hangs up quickly before the tears can start again, before her voice breaks completely. She leans against Chloe's truck and closes her eyes, trying to focus, trying not to lose it again in broad daylight on a public street.*

*The sun is climbing higher, casting sharp shadows between the buildings. A dog barks somewhere in the distance. Life continues around her with oblivious normalcy while her world crumbles.*

*Finally, she manages to collect herself enough to stand. Her legs feel unsteady, but they hold. She takes one more deep breath of the cold morning air and heads back inside.*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT DAY - 10:40 AM**

*A silver sedan pulls up to the curb with the urgency of emergency responders. Ryan and Vanessa are arriving with hastily packed bags visible through the rear window, clear evidence of their drive from SEATTLE to SALEM.*

*Max has been waiting outside the apartment door for the last twenty minutes, pacing the small landing like a caged animal. When she sees the car, relief hits her so hard she nearly stumbles.*

*Ryan is out of the driver's seat before the engine fully stops, his hair disheveled from the long drive. Vanessa emerges more slowly from the passenger side, but her face carries the same worried urgency.*

*Max is already running toward them, her composure finally cracking completely.*

**MAX**  
(voice breaking)  
Dad...

*Ryan catches her in a fierce hug, his arms strong and reassuring around her shaking shoulders. She buries her face against his chest, breathing in the familiar smell of his cologne mixed with coffee and worry.*

**RYAN**  
(voice rough with emotion)  
We're right here, honey. We're right here.

*Vanessa wraps her arms around both of them, creating a protective circle. For the first time in days, Max feels like she can actually breathe.*

**VANESSA**  
(stroking Max's hair)  
We're going to figure this out, sweetheart. Together.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER**

*The small apartment feels even more cramped with four people in it. Ryan and Vanessa move efficiently around the space, setting down their hastily packed overnight bags near the door. There's something comforting about their presence, the way they immediately start assessing the situation with the calm competence of adults who've handled crises before.*

*The bedroom door remains closed, a barrier that feels increasingly ominous.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice quiet but determined)  
We should check on her first. Let her know we're here.

*Max nods, hovering near the bedroom door like she's afraid to go through it alone.*

**MAX**  
She's... she's really different from how she was in Seattle. I don't want you to be shocked.

**RYAN**  
(squeezing her shoulder)  
We can handle it, kiddo.

*They approach the bedroom together, Ryan leading the way with the careful confidence of someone who's dealt with his share of teenage crises. He knocks gently on the doorframe before entering.*

**RYAN**  
Chloe? It's Ryan and Vanessa. Mind if we come in?

*From inside comes a rustling sound, the noise of someone trying to make themselves presentable.*

**CHLOE**  
(voice muffled)  
Yeah, come in.

**INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS**

*The room is dim despite the late morning hour, heavy curtains blocking most of the sunlight. Chloe is awake, propped against a heap of pillows, but her eyes are tired and glassy, like she's looking at the world through water.*

*Ryan approaches first, pulling the desk chair close to the bed with the easy familiarity of someone who's done this before. Vanessa settles onto the edge of the mattress, close enough to offer comfort but not so close as to crowd.*

*Max remains in the doorway, watching this scene play out with a mixture of hope and anxiety.*

**CHLOE**  
(managing a defiant smile that doesn't reach her eyes)  
Hey, Ryan.

**RYAN**  
(voice infinitely gentle)  
Hey, honey. How are you holding up?

*As he speaks, he reaches out to stroke her hair in a parental gesture, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. His hand settles reassuringly on her shoulder, and for a moment, something in Chloe's rigid posture softens.*

**CHLOE**  
(the defiant smile flickering back)  
Alive and kickin'.

*A small, sad smile forms at the edge of Ryan's lips. He's heard this kind of bravado before.*

**RYAN**  
That's my girl. Though you look like you could use some more sleep.

**CHLOE**  
Sleep's about all I do anymore.

**VANESSA**  
(voice warm but assessing)  
Max says you haven't been eating much.

*Chloe's eyes dart to the doorway where Max stands, and there's something complicated in her expression—guilt, maybe, or frustration at being discussed.*

**CHLOE**  
I eat. Just... not hungry much lately.

**RYAN**  
That's understandable. Sometimes when we're dealing with heavy stuff, our bodies forget how to want the things they need.

*He says it matter-of-factly, without judgment, and Chloe's defensive posture relaxes slightly.*

**CHLOE**  
(voice quieter)  
Everything just tastes like cardboard.

**VANESSA**  
I remember feeling that way after my dad died. Food just seemed... pointless.

*The comparison hangs in the air. They all know this isn't about grief for someone who died naturally, but the parallel is there.*

**CHLOE**  
(after a pause)  
Max has been really good to me. I don't want you to think she hasn't been.

**RYAN**  
We know she has. She loves you very much.

**CHLOE**  
(voice cracking slightly)  
Sometimes I think she loves me too much. Like, more than I deserve right now.

*The admission is raw and honest, and it breaks something in Max's chest.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice firm but kind)  
Love isn't something you earn, honey. It's just something that is.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER**

*After spending twenty minutes with Chloe, assessing her state and offering what comfort they could, Max and her parents regroup in the kitchen. The small space feels charged with worried energy as they huddle around the tiny table.*

*Max looks completely drained, slumped in her chair like someone who's been holding up a collapsing building with her bare hands. Dark circles ring her eyes, and her clothes hang loose on her frame—evidence that she hasn't been taking care of herself either.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice carefully controlled)  
Max, she needs professional help.

**MAX**  
(defensive immediately)  
I've been helping her. I've been—

**RYAN**  
(cutting her off gently)  
You've been doing everything you can. But honey, this is beyond what you can handle alone.

*Max's hands flutter nervously on the table, picking at the edge of a napkin.*

**MAX**  
She's just... she's grieving. People grieve differently. Maybe if I just give her more time—

**VANESSA**  
Max, she's not eating. She's barely speaking. She's sleeping eighteen hours a day.

**RYAN**  
(voice gentle but firm)  
This isn't healthy grief anymore, kiddo. This is depression. Clinical.

*The word hangs in the air like a diagnosis none of them wanted to hear.*

**MAX**  
(voice small)  
What are you saying?

**VANESSA**  
We think she should see a doctor. A psychiatrist.

**MAX**  
(shaking her head)  
She won't go. She hates doctors. She hates—

**RYAN**  
What about inpatient treatment?

*Max's head snaps up, her eyes wide.*

**MAX**  
You mean like... a hospital?

**VANESSA**  
Oregon State Hospital has an excellent psychiatric program. It's not what you're thinking—it's not like the old days. It's about getting her stabilized, getting her the help she needs.

**MAX**  
(voice rising)  
You want to lock her up?

**RYAN**  
(voice steady)  
We want to save her life.

*The words hit Max like a slap. She stares at her father, seeing the grim certainty in his expression.*

**MAX**  
(whisper)  
You think she's... you think she might...?

**VANESSA**  
(voice very gentle)  
I think she's in a very dark place right now. And I think she needs more help than love alone can provide.

*Max puts her head in her hands, her shoulders shaking slightly.*

**MAX**  
I just... I keep thinking if I try harder, if I find the right thing to say or do...

**RYAN**  
(reaching across to squeeze her hand)  
Max, listen to me. This isn't your fault. And it's not something you can fix by yourself.

**VANESSA**  
You remember when you had that really bad anxiety about starting at Blackwell?

*Max nods without lifting her head.*

**VANESSA**  
You didn't get better because we loved you harder. You got better because we got you help. Because we found you someone who knew how to treat anxiety.

**MAX**  
(voice muffled)  
This is different.

**RYAN**  
How?

**MAX**  
Because... because what if she thinks I'm giving up on her? What if she thinks I'm abandoning her just like everyone else?

*The pain in her voice is raw and immediate.*

**VANESSA**  
Oh, sweetheart...

**RYAN**  
Getting someone help isn't abandonment. It's the opposite.

*They sit in silence for a long moment, the weight of the decision settling over them.*

**VANESSA**  
(after a pause)  
Let me talk to her.

*She stands, smoothing down her sweater with the kind of nervous energy that comes before difficult conversations.*

**VANESSA**  
Sometimes it's easier to hear hard truths from someone who's not... as close to the situation.

*She heads toward the bedroom, closing the door gently behind her.*

*Max and Ryan are left alone in the kitchen, the silence thick with unspoken fears. Ryan leans against the counter, studying his daughter with the kind of worried intensity that only parents can muster.*

**RYAN**  
(voice quiet)  
How long has it been since you called us?

**MAX**  
(not meeting his eyes)  
I don't know. A few weeks?

**RYAN**  
Max.

**MAX**  
(defensive)  
I've been busy. And I didn't want to worry you.

**RYAN**  
(voice firmer)  
That's exactly when you should call us. When you're worried, when you're scared, when you're in over your head.

*Max finally looks up, her eyes bright with unshed tears.*

**MAX**  
I thought I could handle it. I thought... after everything we've been through, after surviving Arcadia Bay, I thought I was stronger than this.

**RYAN**  
You are strong. But strength doesn't mean doing everything alone.

*He moves to sit across from her, his expression soft with parental concern.*

**RYAN**  
You know, when you and Chloe first came to stay with us in Seattle, I was terrified.

**MAX**  
How so?

**RYAN**  
Because I could see how much pain you were both carrying. And I didn't know how to help. I kept thinking, what do you say to kids who've been through something like that? How do you even begin to heal that kind of trauma?

*Max remembers those first weeks in Seattle—the way her parents had tiptoed around them both, offering endless cups of tea and gentle suggestions about ""talking to someone.""*

**RYAN**  
But then I realized that healing doesn't happen all at once. It happens in pieces. Day by day. And sometimes you need help putting those pieces back together.

**MAX**  
(voice thick)  
Is that why you didn't fight us when we wanted to move here?

**RYAN**  
Part of it. You both needed space to figure out who you were going to be after everything. And Ben's apartments gave you that space while still keeping family close.

*He reaches across the table to take her hand.*

**RYAN**  
But Max, that doesn't mean you're supposed to carry everything alone. That's not what independence means.

**MAX**  
(voice breaking)  
I just... I love her so much, Dad. And I'm scared that if I can't fix this, if I can't be enough...

**RYAN**  
She'll leave?

*Max nods, tears finally spilling over.*

**RYAN**  
Honey, look at me.

*She meets his eyes.*

**RYAN**  
Love isn't about being enough. It's about showing up, even when you don't know what to do. And that's exactly what you've been doing.

**MAX**  
It doesn't feel like enough.

**RYAN**  
Because you're trying to be her therapist, her caretaker, her girlfriend, and her savior all at once. That's too many jobs for one person.

*From the bedroom comes the soft murmur of voices—Vanessa and Chloe talking in tones too quiet to overhear.*

**RYAN**  
When you first told us about Chloe, when you were little kids, you know what I thought?

**MAX**  
What?

**RYAN**  
I thought, this girl is going to change my daughter's life. And I was right. But change doesn't always look the way we expect it to.

*Max wipes her eyes with the back of her hand.*

**MAX**  
I just don't want to lose her again.

**RYAN**  
Getting her help isn't losing her. It's fighting for her.

*The bedroom door opens, and Vanessa emerges with Chloe beside her. Vanessa's expression is carefully neutral, but there's something hopeful in her eyes. Chloe moves slowly, like someone walking through deep water, but she's upright and present in a way she hasn't been in days.*

*Chloe settles into one of the kitchen chairs, her movements deliberate and careful. She looks small in the oversized chair, but there's something different about her posture—less collapsed, more purposeful.*

**VANESSA**  
(settling back at the table)  
She's agreed to see someone. A psychiatrist.

*Max's head snaps up.*

**MAX**  
Really?

**VANESSA**  
She's scared. But she knows she needs help.

**RYAN**  
What changed her mind?

**VANESSA**  
(small smile)  
I told her that sometimes the bravest thing you can do is admit you can't do something alone.

*Max feels something in her chest loosen for the first time in days—not relief, exactly, but hope. The kind of hope that comes with knowing you're not fighting this battle solo anymore.*

**VANESSA**  
(standing with purposeful energy)  
But first, you need to eat something.

*She moves to the refrigerator with the efficiency of someone who's spent decades feeding people through crises. From the crowded shelves, she retrieves a container of leftover chicken breast and another of rice—evidence of Max's desperate cooking sprees.*

*The microwave hums as Vanessa warms the food, the familiar domestic sound somehow reassuring in the heavy atmosphere. She plates it carefully: tender pieces of chicken, fluffy rice, a simple meal that smells like comfort.*

**VANESSA**  
(setting the plate in front of Chloe)  
Here, sweetheart. Just a few bites.

*Vanessa settles into the chair beside Chloe, close enough to offer support but not so close as to crowd. Ryan and Max instinctively move to lean against the counter, giving them space while maintaining their vigil.*

*Chloe stares at the plate for a long moment, her hands resting limply in her lap. The fork feels impossibly heavy when she finally picks it up.*

**CHLOE**  
(voice barely audible)  
I'll try.

*She takes a small piece of chicken on her fork, raises it halfway to her mouth, then pauses as if the simple act requires enormous concentration. When she finally takes the bite, her chewing is slow and deliberate, like someone working through a complex problem.*

*Ryan and Max watch from their position against the counter, both understanding intuitively that this small act—eating, being fed, accepting care—is monumental.*

*Chloe manages three more bites, each one a small victory. Her movements are mechanical but determined. Then, suddenly, her face goes ashen.*

*The smell hits her without warning—not the warm, comforting aroma of home-cooked chicken, but something else entirely. Something putrid and sweet and wrong. Rachel. Face flashes behind her eyes, not as she was in life, but as Max had found her in the junkyard.*

*Chloe's breathing becomes rapid and shallow, her eyes wide with panic.*

*Before she can spiral completely, before the panic can drag her under, Vanessa's hand covers hers.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice firm but calm)  
Hey, Chloe. Look at me! Here, take my hand.

*Chloe's head snaps up, her terrified eyes locking onto Vanessa's steady gaze. She grips her hand like it's the only thing keeping her tethered to reality.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice steady, anchoring)  
You're here. You're in the kitchen. You're safe. Just breathe with me, okay?

*From the counter, Max's face drains of all color. She tries to look away, unable to bear seeing Chloe in such distress again, but Ryan notices her struggle. He reaches over and takes her hand, startled by how cold her fingers are—like ice.*

**RYAN**  
(squeezing gently, voice low)  
She's okay. She's going to be okay.

*Slowly, steadily, Chloe's breathing begins to stabilize. The panic doesn't disappear entirely, but it recedes enough for her to function. She doesn't let go of Vanessa's hand.*

**VANESSA**  
(after Chloe's breathing evens out)  
Ryan, honey, come over here.

*She gestures with her free hand for him to join them at the table.*

**VANESSA**  
Can you help her with the next piece?

*Ryan understands immediately. He settles into the chair on Chloe's other side, taking the knife and fork to cut the chicken into smaller, more manageable pieces. His movements are gentle and practiced, like he's done this before for other people in crisis.*

*Chloe watches him work, her grip still tight on Vanessa's hand. When he's finished cutting, he sets the fork within easy reach but doesn't try to feed her. The gesture preserves her dignity while acknowledging her need for help.*

**RYAN**  
(voice encouraging but not demanding)  
Come on, honey, you can do it.

*Chloe picks up the fork with her free hand, the movement shaky but determined. She takes another bite, then another. The food stays down.*

*From her position against the counter, Max watches this scene unfold with a mixture of awe and profound sadness. Her parents—who had welcomed Chloe into their family years ago, who had sheltered them both after Arcadia Bay—are now doing what Max couldn't: being the parents that Chloe no longer has.*

*Joyce is gone. William has been gone for years. And here are mom and dad, stepping into that void with the quiet competence that comes from decades of loving difficult people through difficult times.*

*Max's chest tightens with the realization that this is what Chloe needs—not just a girlfriend trying desperately to fix everything, but parental figures who know how to offer support without drowning in their own helplessness.*

*After an agonizing 30 minutes, Chloe manages to clear her whole plate. A small victory, considering this is the first time in days since she has had a full meal.*

**MONTAGE - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL ADMISSION PROCESS**

*A series of quick cuts showing the bureaucratic machinery of mental health care: forms being filled out, insurance cards being photocopied, ID bracelets being attached to thin wrists. Max's hand signing papers she barely reads, her signature shaky with exhaustion and fear.*

*Chloe sits in uncomfortable plastic chairs, staring at institutional beige walls while intake coordinators ask questions in gentle, professional voices. Ryan handles most of the paperwork with the grim efficiency of someone who understands that sometimes love means navigating systems.*

*The final image: Chloe disappearing through double doors marked ""AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY,"" her blue hair the last thing visible before the doors swing shut.*

**CUT TO:**

**INT. APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON**

*The apartment feels enormous without Chloe in it. Max, Ryan, and Vanessa sit around the kitchen table, the silence heavy with unspoken grief. Empty coffee cups and crumpled tissues litter the surface between them.*

**VANESSA**  
(voice gentle but firm)  
We need to talk about what happens next.

*Max stares at her hands, picking at a hangnail until it bleeds.*

**MAX**  
She's going to be okay, right? They said she'd be okay.

**RYAN**  
She's going to get the help she needs. But Max, honey, you can't stay here alone.

**MAX**  
(looking up sharply)  
What do you mean?

**VANESSA**  
We have to get back to Seattle. We've already been gone two days, and with such short notice...

**RYAN**  
My boss has been understanding, but I can't take indefinite leave.

*The reality settles over Max like cold water. She's going to be alone. Again.*

**MAX**  
But what if she needs me? What if something happens and I'm not here?

**VANESSA**  
The hospital will call if there's any change. And Max... you need help too.

*Max wants to protest, but the exhaustion in her bones tells a different story. She's been running on empty for days, maybe weeks.*

**MAX**  
(voice small)  
How long will she be there?

**RYAN**  
They said at least two weeks for stabilization. Maybe longer.

**VANESSA**  
We'll find you someone to talk to in Seattle. A therapist who understands trauma.

*Max nods numbly. The apartment already feels like a tomb.*

**RYAN**  
We'll pack up tonight and leave first thing in the morning. But we'll stop by the hospital to say goodbye.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING - 9:30 AM**

*The hospital sprawls across manicured grounds, its modern facade attempting to soften the institutional reality within. Ryan's car sits in the visitor parking lot, engine ticking as it cools.*

*Max stands outside the main entrance, her hands shaking slightly as she stares at the building that now contains the most important person in her world.*

**VANESSA**  
(approaching from the car)  
They said she can come out for a few minutes.

*Max nods, not trusting her voice. Through the glass doors, she can see a nurse approaching with a familiar figure in tow.*

*Chloe emerges into the morning sunlight looking smaller somehow, like the hospital has already begun the process of diminishing her. She wears pale blue hospital scrubs that hang loose on her frame, the institutional fabric a stark reminder of where she is and why. Her blue hair looks dull against the clinical cotton, and Max feels a stab of loss at seeing her so contained, so medicalized.*

*The nurse, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes, stays close but gives them space.*

**NURSE**  
(to Chloe)  
Ten minutes, okay honey?

*Chloe nods, her eyes fixed on Max with an intensity that suggests she's trying to memorize her face.*

**MAX**  
(forcing brightness into her voice)  
Hey, how are you feeling?

**CHLOE**  
Like I'm in a hospital.

*It's almost a joke, but it falls flat. Both of them are trying too hard to be normal.*

**MAX**  
(the words rushing out)  
So, um, I have to tell you something. We're... I'm going back to Seattle. With mom and dad. While you get better.

*Chloe's face doesn't change, but something shifts behind her eyes.*

**CHLOE**  
(after a pause)  
That's great. You need to take care of yourself too, Max.

**MAX**  
I don't want to leave you.

**CHLOE**  
Me neither.

*They stand there, two people who've shared everything, now separated by circumstances neither of them can control.*

**MAX**  
(struggling to maintain composure)  
I'm going to get some help too. Talk to someone. About... things.

**CHLOE**  
Good. That's good.

*From the parking lot, Ryan starts the car. The sound carries across the morning air like a countdown.*

**MAX**  
(voice tight)  
I should probably...

**CHLOE**  
Yeah.

*They embrace quickly, formally, like distant relatives at a funeral. Max can feel herself fracturing but refuses to break down here, in front of the hospital, where Chloe needs to see her strong.*

**MAX**  
Get better, okay? I'll call you as soon as they let me.

**CHLOE**  
I will. I'll try.

**MAX**  
(backing away)  
I love you.

**CHLOE**  
I love you too.

*Max turns and walks toward the car, her steps measured and deliberate. Behind her, Chloe stands with the nurse, watching.*

**MUSIC CUE**: [Black Flies](https://song.link/i/1446740052) by ***Ben Howard*** begins to play.

*Max reaches the car and climbs into the back seat—the same position she occupied five years ago. Same car, same leather, with the geometry of abandonment identical. She sits behind her mother, watching through the rear window as dad starts the engine.*

*The car begins to move, pulling away from the curb with the inexorable momentum of fate. And there, growing smaller in the distance, is Chloe. Standing alone in her hospital scrubs, diminishing with each passing second.*

*The weight of recognition hits Max like a collapsing building.*

*This has happened before.*

*She's thirteen again, sitting in this exact position, watching through this same rear window as another version of herself drives away from another devastated Chloe. William's funeral. The worst day of Chloe's young life, and Max had been pulled away just when she was needed most.*

*The memory crystallizes with brutal clarity: Chloe in her black suit, standing next to the fresh grave, looking so small and lost. Max pressing her face to the back window of her parents' car, both girls crying as the distance between them grew. The promise to keep in touch that would slowly dissolve into silence.*

*And now, impossibly, it's happening again.*

*Chloe is alone again. Hurting again. And Max is in the back of her parents' car again, being driven away from the person who needs her most. The hospital grows smaller in the distance, taking Chloe with it.*

*The parallel is so perfect it feels orchestrated by some cruel universe that delights in repetition. History doesn't just rhyme—sometimes it screams.*

*But then, like lightning splitting the dark, another thought strikes Max with equal force:*

*She's not thirteen anymore.*

*The girl who sat helplessly in the back seat all those years ago, who accepted that adults made decisions and children obeyed them, who believed that leaving was inevitable—that girl doesn't exist anymore. This Max has moved time itself. This Max has collapsed buildings and resurrected the dead. This Max has learned that sometimes the most important moments require the most impossible choices.*

*And this time, she doesn't need supernatural powers to change history.*

*This time, all she needs is the courage to say ""stop.""*

*Max watches Chloe begin to turn back toward the hospital, and something fierce and bright ignites in her chest. Not the desperate panic of her thirteen-year-old self, but the blazing certainty of someone who has seen what happens when you let the wrong story continue.*

*Just as Chloe begins to fade into the white of the hospital...*

**MAX**  
(urgent, desperate)  
Dad... stop the car.

**RYAN**  
(glancing in the rearview mirror)  
Honey, what's wrong?

**MAX**  
(voice rising with growing intensity)  
Just stop.

**VANESSA**  
(turning around, alarmed by the tone)  
What is it, Max?

**MAX**  
(shouting now)  
Stop this goddamn car right now!

*Ryan hits the brakes, the car lurching to a stop on the shoulder. Before the vehicle fully settles, before her parents can ask questions or offer protests, Max is out. The door slams behind her with the finality of a statement.*

*She runs.*

*Not the hesitant jog of someone unsure of their destination, but the full-sprint of someone who has finally understood what needs to be done. Her feet pound against the asphalt with the rhythm of a heartbeat, each step carrying her further from the girl who accepted abandonment as inevitable.*

*The hospital grounds stretch before her like a battlefield. Chloe is a distant figure in pale blue, still moving toward the entrance, unaware that history is being rewritten behind her.*

**MAX**  
(voice raw and desperate)  
Chloe! Chloe, wait!

*The sound carries across the morning air like a battle cry, the first word of a better story. It cuts through the quiet with the force of something that refuses to be contained.*

*Chloe stops mid-step. The sound of her name, spoken with such desperate intensity, penetrates the fog of medication and depression that has wrapped around her for days. She turns, slowly at first, unsure if she heard correctly.*

*And there, sprinting across the hospital grounds like her life depends on it, is Max.*

**CHLOE**  
(confused, hopeful)  
Max?

*Something primal kicks in, some deep recognition that this moment matters more than breathing. Without fully understanding why, Chloe starts moving too. A hesitant jog at first, her hospital slippers uncertain on the pavement.*

*But then she sees Max's face—sees the desperate love and fierce determination written there—and her body remembers how to run. How to move toward instead of away. How to fight for connection instead of accepting separation.*

*They're both running now, closing the distance between them with gathering momentum. Max's sneakers slap against asphalt while Chloe's hospital slippers whisper against concrete. The space between them collapses second by second, yard by yard.*

*Chloe can see the tears on Max's face, Max can see the hospital bracelet on Chloe's wrist, can see the way the institutional scrubs make her look fragile and young. But she can also see something else—the first real light in Chloe's eyes that she's witnessed in days.*

*Chloe can see Max's hair streaming behind her, can see the absolute determination in her stride, can see the love that has driven her from the back seat of safety into this moment of pure, reckless honesty.*

*The final yards collapse. They're close enough to see each other's expressions clearly, close enough to read the desperate hope and fierce love written on both their faces.*

*And then—*

**CONTACT.**

*Their bodies collide with the force of two celestial objects finding each other across the vast emptiness of space. The impact is crushing, desperate and absolute. Max crashes into Chloe's arms like she's coming home after years of wandering, like she's claiming something that was always hers.*

*Chloe catches her with equal force, her arms wrapping around Max with the strength of someone who has remembered, suddenly and completely, what she has to live for. They hold each other with the intensity of people who have looked into the abyss and chosen instead to look at each other.*

**MAX**  
(sobbing against Chloe's chest)  
You get better for me, okay?  
I can't imagine the world without you in it.  
(her voice cracks with the weight of years)  
Without these arms.  
Without these hands.  
Without your face... your heart...

*Max presses her forehead harder into Chloe's chest, her breath hitching with the kind of tears that come from the deepest places. Chloe's arms tighten around her instinctively, as if afraid Max might disappear if she lets go.*

**CHLOE**  
(voice soft and shaky)  
You won't have to.  
I'm gonna come back.  
Even if it's just duct tape and chewing gum holding me together... I'll come back.

*Max half-laughs, half-sobs at the familiar phrase, something so quintessentially Chloe that it feels like a promise. Chloe lowers her head to rest against Max's hair, breathing in the scent of her shampoo and her skin.*

**CHLOE**  
(voice gaining strength)  
You're my reason, Max.  
Even when I forget everything else... I won't forget that.

*A beat. Max lifts her head slightly, enough to look up into Chloe's eyes. For the first time in days, they're clear. Present. Alive.*

**MAX**  
(voice fierce despite the tears)  
Promise me.

**CHLOE**  
(with a flicker of her old spark, the ghost of a smile)  
Cross my hella broken heart.

*They hold each other as the morning sun climbs higher, two figures silhouetted against the institutional white of the hospital. In the distance, Ryan and Vanessa wait by the car, understanding that this moment belongs entirely to the girls.*

*The music swells, carrying with it the weight of all their partings and all their reunions, all the times they've lost each other and found their way back.*

**FADE OUT.**

I'm not that big into espresso, but I'm considering buying something to at least have the option to make it at home or potentially on the move.

I've done some research into the wacaco coffee makers mentioned, but have also seen some relatively cheap lever espresso machines(flair neo, Hugh leverpresso).

I think the picopresso is looking like the best option so far due to portability and size, but the pixapresso is self heating and therfore makes it slightly more convenient.

Anyone got anything else to recommend that I've missed completely?

I live in Sweden and my budget is 100-150$, but as cheap as possible with good quality is sort of the target. Thankful for any advice, and feel free to ask questions if something's confusing.",2,1754176456.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1mg442k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1mg442k/after_over_five_years_im_done_with_nespresso_due/,After over five years I’m done with Nespresso due to Price.,"Went to reorder vertuo pods and saw 1.40 a pod for Melozio and it finally reached a point where I’m not going to pay that price. We’re a big family. We all drink Nespresso. I have a machine at home and at work. We love our Nespresso whether it be the one ouncers, the half cafe’s, decaf, melozio or any numerous specialty coffee they offer. We can easily afford it. It’s just the principle of the matter. 

Inflation doesn’t exist. Just a way for these cooperations to make more money. If inflation was real how come all these companies like Walmart and Exxon are reporting record profits?  

Anyways, I’ll be putting away my machines and buying a keurig tomorrow. We don’t have to pay these prices. And when as a whole we just stop paying, they will lower prices. 

Hope to be back one day soon but until then 1.40 a cup is the line for me. ",0,1754176401.0,nespresso,60,0.46,False

All except one date, we didn't vibe that much, but all were fine.

I'm realizing all of the dates could have been more fun. And one or two of them might have gone on to a second date if it had been more fun.

I come here to ask advice for how to go about transplanting some trees. The trees in question probably won't require it for a while, but I was wondering if there was a way to safely separate the pot from the roots+dirt without having to cut it. The trees pictured are a Kentucky Coffee Tree (Smaller one without leaves) and a Mulberry tree (taller one with leaves at the bottom). They are over 12 inches tall.

I'd Also love to know when I should replant them, if it's even necessary, and where I should do so. I was considering transplanting them in a forest since they're local, but IDK for sure. Thanks for reading.

1mg42ev,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mg42ev,New Mahlkönig X64 SD,"The Mahlkönig X64 SD represents a massive leap forward from their previous home grinder, the X54, which in my experience suffered from unimpressive burr geometry and inconsistent particle distribution, especially at espresso fineness, not to mention the mild frustration in trying to dial in new coffees.

By contrast, the X64 SD is worlds better. Its 64 mm flat burr set (optimized geometry, machined in Germany) delivers a remarkably tight particle size distribution, with a noticeably narrower standard deviation compared to conical grinders in the same segment. 

The burrs produce fewer fines at coarser settings, giving pour‑overs exceptional clarity, while still generating the low-end density needed for high extraction yields in espresso. 

The 1,950 RPM, high-torque motor maintains a consistent feed rate of 3–6 g/sec with minimal torque fluctuation, reducing bimodal particle shifts even under denser roasts. 

Retention is effectively zero (<0.1 g) thanks to the angled burr chamber, short grind path, and well-designed bellows system, which not only clear the chamber but also reduce static. 

The stepless collar has micro-adjustment precision fine enough to confidently move between V60, flatbed brewers, and espresso without losing calibration, something I found impossible on the X54. 

In terms of thermal management, the low-resonance motor and burr carrier keep burr temperatures far lower than legacy home grinders, even after multiple back-to-back doses. 

The result is a grinder that feels like a scaled-down commercial EK-series platform, purpose-built for single dosing rather than retrofitted for it.",0,1754176269.0,espresso,7,0.37,False
