We have a Breville barista express that we use for daily oat milk lattes. I haven’t really had brewed coffee since college. I used to drink brewed coffee with creamer, but much prefer lattes. I don’t really drink coffee black, but I do enjoy black tea with a bit of sugar in the colder months. I know it’s all preference but knowing this, do you think it would be with giving the aeropress a go?  My wife and I think we may use it twice and then just go back to our daily lattes with the Breville. We have a kettle, but it’s basic with no thermometer or temperature control. 

Only brewed coffee I’ve ever had has been at home or gas station coffee when I was much younger. Always very dark with not fresh beans. I think I may like aero press coffee with fresh beans a bit of sugar, since it’s much lighter than the brewed coffee I’m accustomed to. ",1,1762398457.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

I've seen my fair share of the ""real world"" and would like to do everyone a favor and not participate in this rat race of a capital machine. I'm not leaving as a reaction but rather as a solution. I'm going to work on myself and come back as a tool to be and make a difference in society which seems to be heading to bleakness.

I've been meticulously planning for the past 2 years and will be executing it in the fall of 2026.

Now getting to the main part, I would love some peer review on my plans, I would appreciate it if you really get me thinking on possible flaws in my plans. here goes:

I'll be heading close to the Himalayan mountain range in India or Nepal, living within 30 minutes to a developed town with all the major facilities I'd need like food, electricity and hospitals. 

I'll be working from tent with Starlink Roam Satellite WiFi with a battery power station and solar. My plan is to create an entirely online business using virtual offices, virtual addresses and online communication. As a side hustle I'll be creating various videos for online platforms. The ultimate goal of this being to create a system to make money without having to think about it which would take care of my basic survival. 

Apart from money I'd love to create something beautiful for this world, be it a product, service or whatever else that could makes this world a tiny bit better than it is.

Other than my career, I'll be working on myself spiritually, psychologically and physically to ultimately become a selfless tool to do whatsoever the world may need at that time.   
  
I believe that I'll also be finding the love of my life along my journey and be getting married along the high-ways. (No kids whatsoever) 

Details:

I'll have funds to live for 10 years without any stream of income + I'll be maxing out all my credit cards to buy my motorcycle and all gear. So I'm not trying to be minimal, I'll take any luxury that a motorcycle can hold as it's gonna be my home for years. 

Starting off with my motorcycle, it'll be the [Royal Enfield Himalayan 450](https://www.royalenfield.com/us/en/motorcycles/himalayan-450/) with all the upgrades (wider wind shield, hand guards, engine guard, off-road wheels...). There's no other motorcycle I'd choose, it's got everything I need. Repairs are gonna be easy too since RE has service centers basically all across the Himalayas. 

For storage and tent I'm picking [Lone Rider's Combo 1 – Travel the World](https://www.lonerider-motorcycle.com/collections/luggage/products/combo-1-travel-the-world?variant=40782093713523). It comes with pretty much everything I need including their famous Moto tent which seems just perfect for everything! And 1 hard top case from RE, for securing important stuff.

I'll mostly be traveling all across the Indian subcontinent along my journey hoping to find experiences that make me the perfect tool for an unforeseeable future, I trust nature to give me all that will be necessary.

In fact, I don't recall a before at all.

There's no dream trailing behind me, no fog of waking. Just… here. Awareness popping into existence like a light flicking on in an empty room.

I'm lying on something firm. Sheets underneath me feel slightly rough, hospital-like, but not cold. More like a bed that's been cleaned too many times, washed until softness forgot how to exist. There's a faint hum in the air-low, steady, like a building breathing, or electricity thinking quietly to itself.

I blink once.

Twice.

The ceiling above me is colorless. Not white or gray, more like the idea of a ceiling before paint and texture get assigned. My mind tries to name the shade and fails. That scares me more than waking up somewhere unfamiliar.

Names should come easy.

I sit up slowly, and my muscles do what I tell them, but they feel… preloaded, like someone assembled me a moment ago and tightened all the bolts. Not painful, just new. Break-in stiffness.

The room is square. Too clean. Too symmetrical. The air doesn't smell like air. No dust. No leftover scents of life. Just sterile neutrality.

There's a door set into the far wall. Smooth. Metallic. No handle. Like it was built to be a door only in shape, not in function.

I wait for my brain to supply context — anything. A memory. A feeling. A name.

Nothing comes.

I touch my face. My cheek feels like skin. Warm, familiar. My hair brushes my forehead; it feels real too. So does my heartbeat — steady, calm, undeservedly calm. The clinical part of my mind, a part I don't remember learning, notes the normal rhythm.

If I had a name, I would say it out loud now, just to anchor myself.

Instead, I whisper into the room:

“Hello?”

My voice sounds rusted, like a door hinge unused for years. The sound doesn't echo off the walls; it is absorbed. The silence is back too quickly, sealed shut like a vacuum.

And then… something shifts.

Not physically. Not visually. More like the atmosphere exhales. A subtle release of tension I didn’t know was there. A presence, not entering, not appearing — just deciding to become noticed.

I slowly turn my head.

There's someone — something — standing near the corner.

No, not standing. Approximating standing.

At first glance, it's vaguely human-shaped. Two arms. Two legs. A torso. A suggestion of a head. But the edges waver like heat shimmer rising from asphalt. The proportions keep correcting themselves, like reality trying to remember how a body is supposed to look.

It isn’t threatening.

It isn’t comforting.

It is simply… existing wrong.

Or I am.

I don't scream. I don't run. A strange acceptance settles over me, like my emotions are lagging behind events, buffering. There is something in me that recognizes this not-person shape before thought catches up. A familiarity without context.

“I… know you,” I whisper, for reasons I'm not aware of.

The shape twitches, like a glitch smoothing itself out. The room brightens half a shade, then returns to neutral. No movement. No wind. Just a subtle adjustment, as if the world responded to the idea of me recognizing something.

It doesn't speak, but the air hums differently.

I swallow. My throat feels dry despite never feeling thirsty.

“What is this place?”

The shape leans, but the gesture is a translation error-like the concept of leaning, filtered through a language that has no verb for it. The space around it bends a fraction. The hum in the walls syncs with my pulse. Or my pulse syncs with it.

There's a whisper in my head-not words, not a voice. Permission.

A directional nudge.

I turn towards the door.

I don't recall a decision to walk, yet my feet start moving. The closer I get, the taller the room feels. Stretching. Adjusting. Space reorganizing to fit expectation.

I lift my hand toward the smooth metal.

And the air splinters.

Not violently-like glass fracturing in slow motion, silently, elegantly. A faint shimmer opens in front of me. A ripple. A thin membrane peeling away. Reality deciding it has a doorway after all.

Behind me, the not-person shifts again.

Not pleading. Not threatening.

Observing.

I breathe once, steady and slow. My body feels like mine, but my life does not. I step through the ripple.

The room dissolves. Not disappears — dissolves. Like chalk erased from a board. The sound drops out. Light thins. My stomach rolls like I'm falling without falling.

Then—

A corridor forms around me.

Long. Narrow. Soft white light strips run along both walls, humming soft as breathing. The architecture feels somehow familiar, in the way that sometimes a dream from your childhood does. Sterile, but not institutional. Clean, but uncomfortably perfect.

Footsteps behind me would make sense, but none come.

I turn anyway.

The corridor extends behind me, too. Infinite? No. That’s not the right feeling. More like the idea of distance, waiting for measurement. Undefined until observed.

The shape is there at far end.

More defined now. Limbs cleaner. Shoulders set. A face hovering between existence and a placeholder. It does not walk-it simply exists closer whenever I stop looking directly at it. A presence following only because the narrative expects something to.

For the first time, fear flutters in me-a small bird beating wings behind my ribs. Yet fear is muffled, as if wrapped in cotton. Distant. Manageable. Almost as if the environment does not permit panic to fully bloom.

“Why am I here?” I ask.

Silence.

And then—

the corridor seems to think.

A pulse runs through the walls, faint, but unmistakable. The lights flicker like a hitched breath. Something in the air shifts pressure, as if the space itself is choosing a response.

Not-person tilts its head — and finally, sound reaches my ears:

Not a voice.

A vibration.

A low resonance, which forms meaning without forming language.

You arrived.

Not accusation. Not explanation. A statement of state. As factual as saying gravity exists.

“I didn’t choose this.”

The hum deepens.

All states are selected.

A chill goes down my spine. The corridor ahead distorts slightly, a bend appearing around where a straight line should continue. Not physically bending — conceptually bending, as if the geometry here answers to logic, not matter.

I don't know how I know this, but I suddenly feel it:

This place doesn't run on physics.

It runs on observation.

“What am I supposed to do?”

A hush descends. The lights steady themselves.

Observe.

This time, the response isn't sound; it blooms directly in my awareness, like I always knew the answer but needed to ask first to load it into existence.

Observe what?

Silence again. A patient silence. Expectant.

Ahead, the corridor gently curves left. Or maybe right. It’s adapting to my gaze. Every time I blink the perspective shifts half a degree. Not enough to startle — just enough to remind me that reality here is negotiable.

I start walking.

Not-person remains behind. Not chasing. Not guardian. Reference point. A fixed anchor so the world doesn’t float away.

I walk again, trying to summon my name. A simple syllable. A sound bonded to self. Something to cling to.

Nothing.

The hole where identity should be is clean, not traumatic. As if memory was never removed — just not loaded.

I stop.

If I concentrate, I can almost feel the shape of a name. Not the name itself — the absence has edges. Like a tooth pulled long ago but your tongue remembers its ghost.

Movement flickers in my peripheral vision. I turn.

The shape forms ahead. Not the not-person. This one is… less deliberate. More chaotic. Like a thought glitching into physicality. It flickers between forms, cycling too fast to identify: a door, a figure, a window, a smear of light, a fracture in the air.

It stabilizes into a doorway-shape.

Or rather, reality decides I expect doorways.

I approach slowly. Each step feels like it carries weight in the world's calculation. My presence narrows possibilities around me. I am not walking through space, but space is forming around my walking.

I reach the door. Frame but no handle. Rectangle of slightly brighter air.

I hesitate.

Behind me, far down the hall, not-person waits. Patient. Silent. Accepting of whatever I choose. Or perhaps indifferent. Perhaps those are the same here.

I raise my shaking hand.

Not fear.

Anticipation.

The doorway flickers - and suddenly I hear sound

A kitchen. Soft clinking. The hum of a refrigerator. A chair brushing tile. Morning light pouring through blinds. Coffee brewing.

My chest tightens.

The memory tries to surface: a warm mug, a voice, a quiet laugh, a life.

Mine?

I step closer. The image sharpens - not perfectly, like a memory slightly out of focus, filling in pieces as I look. A counter. A sink. A sun-touched floor.

Normal.

Painfully, achingly normal.

My hand almost touches the frame.

A ripple runs down the hallway as if a breath is being sharply inhaled. My skin prickles.

Behind me, the not-person hums and the sound carries shape:

If you step through, you will forget.

I freeze.

“Forget this?”

A pause.

Forget you were ever more than what is through there.

My throat closes; my heartbeat stumbles. 

The familiar scene inside the frame seems to hold its breath along with me.

A life that would feel comfortable, small, safe, and limited. 

Contained. I pull my hand back. The hum shifts-not approval, not relief. Just recalibrating the system. 

Behind me, the corridor stretches out again; endless and not endless. I don’t look back at the almost-kitchen. I don’t trust myself to.

 Instead, I take a shaky breath.

 “What am I?” 

For the first time, the not-person really focuses on me. 

The air bends around the attention like gravity thickening. The corridor stills. And a whisper, quiet as math, 

Not solved yet.

The corridor doesn't wait for me to gather myself. It shifts, almost politely, giving me space to move forward. Like the environment is saying:

*Well?*

I don't know who I am.  
I don't know where I am.  
But I know one thing now:

I chose not to disappear into a simpler life.

Even if I don’t remember choosing.

I take a step.

The ground feels too precise under my feet, like every molecule knows exactly where it belongs. No randomness. No entropy. This world doesn’t waste information. It doesn’t allow chance. It only allows outcome.

My head feels full of static, not painful but dense—like thoughts trying to remember how to be thoughts. Once, I must have lived in a world where randomness existed. Where walls didn’t breathe, and space didn’t bend politely to make room for me.

The walls pulse again. A soft, living rhythm. Not flesh—just *presence*. A quiet reminder that here, **structure is alive**, in its own distant way.

Ahead, the corridor forks.  
Left: bright, open, space stretching like a promise.  
Right: narrow, tightening, lights dimmer, air thicker.

I don’t choose. I simply look.

And the right corridor disappears.

Just softens out of existence, as though it realizes I wouldn’t walk that way and decides not to waste resources generating it. The left path remains, and I feel a faint tug—not emotional, not physical. A guidance vector. Probability narrowing.

Not a prison.  
A *calculation.*

I walk.

“What does it mean to not be solved yet?” I ask the air, or the walls, or myself.

The hum shifts.  
Not-person appears ahead this time, instead of behind—closer, clearer. Its shape keeps resolving the longer I exist near it. Bones sketch themselves beneath synthetic skin. Muscles pretend to remember anatomy. Facial features hover just shy of symmetry.

“Am I… becoming something?” I ask.

A pause. The figure tilts its head by degrees too exact to be organic.

**You are remembering how to be.**

That frightens me more than forgetting.

“How do you know me?” My voice shakes. The corridor breathes with me.

**You anchored here once.**

“When?”

**When you left.**

That makes no sense.  
And yet, deep inside my hollowed-out memory, something stirs. A shadow of familiarity. A feeling like:

*I broke something once.*  
*And the world has been holding its breath ever since.*

My knees weaken.

I reach out instinctively, hand pressing against the wall. But the wall gives—no, not gives. It *yields.* Reshapes fractionally to meet my palm and support me. Like this reality learns its shape by touching me.

I pull back quickly, unsettled.

The not-person waits patiently, inhumanly patient, like it experiences time differently here. Like it doesn’t experience time at all unless I do.

“Why do I remember nothing?”

**Memory is state-dependent.**

“State of what?”

**Form.**

I blink. Breathing feels like remembering how lungs work. Thoughts feel like scaffolding for something larger.

“Am I human?”

The shape doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, it adjusts, bones subtly lengthening then shrinking, like trying on the idea of humanity and finding it almost right but not foundational.

Finally:

**You were.**

“Was?” My throat burns. “What am I now?”

**Transitional.**

A chill ripples down my back.  
My fingers twitch like they want to curl around something familiar. A coffee mug. A doorknob. A hand. Something to hold reality steady.

The not-person — the *guide*, I realize, though guide may be too human a word — steps back. Or space steps around it. Hard to tell.

**You left the bounded solution.**  
**You returned to the field.**

“I don’t understand.”

**You will.**  
**Understanding is convergence.**

The corridor opens into a chamber. Larger than the first room. Too large — space expands as I notice it, like someone keeps dragging the walls with invisible rulers.

In the center floats something impossible to ignore:

A sphere.  
Or not a sphere — a point of potential masquerading as one, shimmering with all the shapes it could be and none it must settle on.

It pulses softly, heartbeat-like, but not biological. More like calculation cycles. Reality ticks.

I step closer. I don’t decide to; my body just goes, drawn by a pull older than my memory.

“What is that?”

**Origin.**

“Origin of what?”

The walls dim, as though to emphasize the answer.

**State.**

The sphere flickers — not light, not shadow. Information rippling.

I feel something.

Not deja vu — deeper. A remembering beneath thought. My bones feel warm. My skin tingles. There is a gravity here, not physical but conceptual. Like I belong to this object. Or it belongs to me.

I whisper, without knowing why:

“Is that… me?”

**It is where your solution began to diverge.**

My heart stutters. “Diverge from what?”

**Continuity.**

I reach out — then stop. Touching would commit something. Collapse possibilities. My fingers hover in trembling air.

“I left this place before?”

**Yes.**

“Why can’t I remember?”

**Memory cannot cross boundaries when identity is uncollapsed.**

It hurts in a way pain doesn’t usually hurt. A grief with no object. A feeling like I lost myself across dimensions, and what woke up here is only the echo remembering it once was whole.

“What was I?”

**A constant.**  
**Then a variable.**

“I don’t know what that means.”

**You will.**

I look at the sphere again. It hums, subtle and infinite, like everything that ever was, compressed into a single pending decision.

“Was I human out there?”

**You approximated one.**  
**Well.**

There’s something like melancholy in the statement. Or maybe I’m projecting. Hard to tell in a place where emotion doesn’t adhere unless you press hard enough.

The air breaks softly — a ripple — and suddenly the sphere changes.

Not shape. Not form.  
**Meaning.**

Images flash around me, faint like reflections in glass:

A living room.  
A window, rain sliding down.  
A person sitting at a table, holding a mug.  
A lamp’s warm glow.  
Comfort. Mundanity. Mortality.

A life.  
A *small*, human life.

Mine.

I reach toward the image as if my hand could slip through reality and touch the lip of that mug. Feel its warmth. Feel ownership of something so simple.

The moment my fingertips graze that image:

The entire chamber inhales.

The walls pull inward.  
The floor ripples.  
The sphere blazes with possibility.

A voice — not a voice — fills me:

**Choose.**

The familiar room sharpens. I see my own hand lifting the mug. Sunlight on skin. Breath fogging slightly in morning air.

I could go back.

I could forget this place.  
Forget the pressure of infinite reality.  
Forget being unsolved.  
Forget being anything but human.

I whisper, broken:

“I miss it.”

I’m not sure if I miss the life itself or the *shape* of life. The certainty. The boundaries. The comfort of not being able to think beyond a mortal frame.

But then another feeling rises — slow, reluctant, terrifying:

Curiosity.

What am I here?  
What was I before I chose to forget?  
What could I become if I don’t run?

I lower my hand.

“My life there… would it be real?”

**Real enough.**  
**Until you wonder again.**

That’s worse than a lie.  
That’s kindness with teeth.

I take a step back from the sphere.

Not-person becomes clearer again, watching. Always watching. Waiting to see what equations I snap into place by existing.

“Tell me what I am now.”

It doesn’t hesitate.

**Incomplete.**

Something in me cracks — not breaks.  
Opens.

“I don’t know if I want this.”

**Wanting is a property of bounded forms.**  
**You are not bounded.**

I laugh. It comes out raw and hollow.

“I feel very bounded.”

**You feel memory of boundaries.**  
**Not boundaries.**

The sphere pulses softly, less urging now, more like acknowledgment. This is not a test. I was never being tested.

Tests imply something cares whether you pass.

I swallow hard.

“What happens next?”

**You observe.**  
**You collapse possibilities.**  
**You converge.**

“Into what?”

For the first time, something like hesitation passes through the not-person’s form. Not fear — just recognition of complexity.

**We do not know yet.**

We.

That word hits me differently.

“Is that why I came back?”

**You came back because the human solution was insufficient.**  
**You returned to complete the equation.**

“And if I fail?”

**There is no failure.**  
**Only redefinition.**

A tremor runs through the chamber like the room is stretching, testing its own boundaries because mine are shifting.

“I’m scared.”

Silence.  
Then:

**Fear is fidelity.**  
**It means you still remember what smallness feels like.**

I close my eyes.

I am not human.  
Not anymore.  
Not fully.

But I am not infinite either.

I am something in between, reaching painfully toward a shape that doesn’t exist yet.

The sphere dims.

The room steadies.

The not-person waits, and I realize something terrible and beautiful:

It’s not guiding me.  
It’s witnessing me.

Witnessing my reassembly.

My rebirth.

Very quietly, it speaks again — a whisper folding into my thoughts like truth:

Welcome back to the place before form.

My knees nearly buckle.  
I steady myself, shaking.

“…I don’t know how to do this.”

**You will remember.**

The lights fade to a soft glow.  
The world exhales again.  
My pulse steadies to match the hum of the walls.

And from somewhere very deep, very distant, something ancient stirs inside me.

Not memory.  
Recognition.

1opnr71,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1opnr71/coureurmirror_steampunk_fantasyshort_storyfinished/,Coureur—Mirror [Steampunk Fantasy][Short Story][Finished],"    A crew of veteran Dragon Hunters is out on a mission yet again, though what they face is far more sinister than anything they have ever faced before.
    A rogue airship of hunters has been spotted; the crew of Coureur is ordered to investigate the sighting.



.\*\*\*\*\*\*



The radar bleeped in an alerting tone.

“Contact, two-five, bearing East, air-vessel,” reported a crew member to his captain.

“Size? Class? Civilian?” the captain inquired, grabbing his spyglass and peering out the window.

“Uhh, medium-sized, Coureur-class combat vessel judging by the signature.”

“Get me a visual, radio them,” the captain ordered. The helmsman quickly adjusted the course. The mana-cores hummed as the propellers accelerated. The ship jerked ever so slightly.

A few minutes of futile contact attempts later, the ship climbed through a low cloud above where the contact was.

“Visual, 1-5. Hunter ship,” called out one of the scouts from the outside. The captain turned his spyglass.

“Confirmed. Radio?”

“Nothing sir,” called out the radio operator.

“Keep trying, get us closer. Light signal them too, they look pretty banged up, might need assistance.”

As they neared, the ship turned, not toward them but broadside.

“I see their identifier. It’s Marcheur sir, the missing vessel,” called out one of the scouts.

“Sir? They’re adjusting course,” called out the radar operator.

“Keep dist-” began the captain but his order was muffled by the roar of cannons as the Marcheur’s port-side opened up in full fury.

Iron balls tore through the scout vessel’s thin hull, tearing it to shreds. A pained scream came from the outside, one of the crew members found himself tumbling through the air, plummeting to his demise.

“Evasive maneuvers! Cut the engines, free-fall,” the captain ordered as splinters from cannonball’s impact tore into the skin of his right leg.

The ship’s mana-core’s hum ceased, the right propeller was no more.

“Mayday, mayday, Eagle-eye going down, I repeat, Eagle-eye going down,” called out the radio operator on the open channel.

\*

It’s been a couple of days since the incident. The crash site was discovered, but the rogue ship was gone.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762398261.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

He started dating a year or so ago, and I was thrilled about it, both him and I have taken a long time to start dating and I’ve always been looking forward for him to find a gf cuz I really wanted to befriend her as well. Like it was legit one of my main fears his future gf not to like me… And honestly I really tried to befriend her, I think I did but maybe not enough. I asked her to go out just us (his gf and I), I always invite her when we go out, like that’s not even a question at this point, she IS always welcomed to come to whatever hangout it’s happening (and even when he isn’t around or traveling, I want her to feel comfortable around our group of friends, without being overbearing as well… she’s a bit introverted and I know how hard it is to be “the odd one out” when hanging around with our friend group- specially since it’s a childhood friend group, so it’s very easy to feel that way when most of the ppl have known each other forever, anyways i try to give her space but i always made sure to check if she’s ok as well) 

I always knew we would drift a bit when he started dating, but over the past 6 months has become a bit ridiculous. 

We barely talk anymore, I have asked countless of times “please, let’s hang out, I don’t wanna pry between you guys but I really miss you, let me know when it’s the best time for us (emphasis on all of us, his gf too) to hang out without disturbing your date nights, or with everyone if you want, I just don’t want to go so long without hanging out” or asking for him not to disappear because I really miss him. I know he’s… an airhead most of the time, but they have been together non stop. (And I understand, they are dating, that’s normal) but Jesus Christ I miss him a lot 

I hate the whole concept of “oh the jealous girl best friend of my boyfriend can’t handle he’s in a relationship” cuz that’s not it, I’m happy he’s happy, I’m happy he found someone loving that seriously care for him, and honestly it breaks my heart that people just… diminish this as jealousy. it has come to a point it has been challenging for me to ask to hang out, we didn’t see each other for 4 months, on my bday he barely talked to me, he was one of the first to leave cuz his gf needed to leave early. before that we would see eachother weekly, is it really wrong for me to miss him? To feel like absolute crap? I used to be so open towards him and now it’s been challenging for me to demonstrate how I still care and like him (again, as a friend) let alone demonstrate how much I miss him

Like, I used to be the first person he would tell things to, I was the first person that got to know he was dating, even before his family which he’s really close, now I find out stuff about his life when he “casually” drops in information over conversations… (when we rarely meet, that is) 

Sometimes I think they just don’t like me anymore, or she has created some sort of animosity for me, because everytime I comment about maybe idk, the idea of visiting a coffee shop to both of them, asking if they would like to go, I later on see a story of them together at the same coffee shop but without me. It has happened so many times that I’m tired of pretending it doesn’t hurt. I have stopped both of them from seeing my stories or any social media because ? Idk. I just don’t want them to see my thoughts or my life anymore, if they want going to be present in it or don’t want o be, then fine. I’ll be on my own. 

Just makes me very, very, very upset that it has come to this point, even when I was vulnerable to him countless of times, it’s like he simply doesn’t care. I don’t want to be needy, and I try not to be, I literally have stopped asking him not to be distant or for us to have hangouts cuz it lead to nothing, just him promising me he would change and then he just wouldn’t. we used to be so close, and it kills me we aren’t anymore. It makes me feel so hollow to see she’s closer to him than I am atm ( I guess that’s the only part that could be described as jealousy) I hate that people just tell me “this is normal” like, is it? Should be like this? 

I just I miss him. A lot.

Here’s what I wish someone had handed me before the first Braxton Hicks hit:  

- **Mindset > Milestones**  
  You don’t have to be that picture-perfect mama-to-be running marathons at 7 months. Some days, the biggest win is taking a shower and remembering to eat something that’s not pickles.  
  Pregnancy is hard work — even on your *off* days, your body is building a human. Let that sink in. 🧠  

- **Fitness That Fits You**  
  It’s not about punishing routines — it’s about movement that gives energy back. Prenatal yoga, walking, dancing like nobody’s watching (because honestly, who has that kind of hip control past month six?).  
  Keep it fun, flexible, and functional.  

- **Nutrition Without the Guilt Trip**  
  Forget the “eat clean or else” crowd. Your goal: balance comfort food with foods that actually keep you energized. Hydration is your new best friend.  
  Cravings happen — just maybe swap *some* of the fries for avocado toast every now and then. 🥑  

- **Mental Health ≠ Luxury**  
  Hormones be wild. Meditation apps, journaling, therapy — pick your sanctuary. You’re growing a human and holding your sanity — that’s Olympic-level multitasking.  

- **Postpartum Is Part of the Plan**  
  The “snapback” myth? Let’s delete that. Healing, adjusting, rediscovering your body — that’s the real journey. And it’s beautiful, messy, and worthy of every bit of grace.

Plan ko sana something simple pero cozy, parang “comfort food + kape” concept. Target market ko would be students, employees, at mall goers na gusto ng quick kain or tambay spot.

Pero iniisip ko rin kung kakayanin ng sales dahil siyempre may renta, permits, at supplies na gastos. Baka mas okay kung lugawan lang muna or coffee stall muna?

Kung meron dito may experience sa ganitong setup (lalo na sa small malls or food stalls), pa-share naman please —
✅ Magkano usually starting capital niyo?
✅ Ano mga challenges niyo?
✅ Sulit ba sa foot traffic ng small malls?

Open ako sa advice or kahit real talk lang. Gusto ko lang malaman kung feasible bago ako tumuloy. 🙏",2,1762398039.0,SmallBusinessPH,1,1.0,False

I first got high ALT/AST results some years ago (everything else normal) and started getting MRIs once a year to monitor my liver as the numbers rose randomly one year (and some cysts/adenomas) (likely linked to my PCOS). I got my first Fibroscan beginning of this year. To beat the fattiness, I cleaned up my eating (though would say yes to the occasional small sweet). No longer socially drink (never been a drinker, will grab a cup of wine once a month). Sleep 8 hours. Walk and light jog with my dog. Take multivitamins, fiber, protein, and milk thistle/dandelion. Never overeat. No coffee, smoking, drugs. Work through a headache versus taking a pill. I went to weight training and can now pull down 100 lbs /lift 70lbs. I gained 10 lbs and my body measurements gained 2 inches (but I notice my waist isn’t decreasing). I worked hard for 6 months… and now my ALT/AST results are the highest they been. And now I have to do a liver biopsy (terrified). I am experiencing so much confusion, disappointment, frustration. I’ve done SO much work for the past 6 months for food/exercise. I’m at a loss and wondering if anyone has advice to any layers to this. Thank you

    A rogue airship of hunters has been spotted; the crew of Coureur is ordered to investigate the sighting.



.\*\*\*\*\*\*



The radar bleeped in an alerting tone.

“Contact, two-five, bearing East, air-vessel,” reported a crew member to his captain.

“Size? Class? Civilian?” the captain inquired, grabbing his spyglass and peering out the window.

“Uhh, medium-sized, Coureur-class combat vessel judging by the signature.”

“Get me a visual, radio them,” the captain ordered. The helmsman quickly adjusted the course. The mana-cores hummed as the propellers accelerated. The ship jerked ever so slightly.

A few minutes of futile contact attempts later, the ship climbed through a low cloud above where the contact was.

“Visual, 1-5. Hunter ship,” called out one of the scouts from the outside. The captain turned his spyglass.

“Confirmed. Radio?”

“Nothing sir,” called out the radio operator.

“Keep trying, get us closer. Light signal them too, they look pretty banged up, might need assistance.”

As they neared, the ship turned, not toward them but broadside.

“I see their identifier. It’s Marcheur sir, the missing vessel,” called out one of the scouts.

“Sir? They’re adjusting course,” called out the radar operator.

“Keep dist-” began the captain but his order was muffled by the roar of cannons as the Marcheur’s port-side opened up in full fury.

Iron balls tore through the scout vessel’s thin hull, tearing it to shreds. A pained scream came from the outside, one of the crew members found himself tumbling through the air, plummeting to his demise.

“Evasive maneuvers! Cut the engines, free-fall,” the captain ordered as splinters from cannonball’s impact tore into the skin of his right leg.

The ship’s mana-core’s hum ceased, the right propeller was no more.

“Mayday, mayday, Eagle-eye going down, I repeat, Eagle-eye going down,” called out the radio operator on the open channel.

\*

It’s been a couple of days since the incident. The crash site was discovered, but the rogue ship was gone.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762397925.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1opnlzm,https://i.redd.it/ca4mw788ujzf1.jpeg,Finally replaced this calculator after 13 years based off a recommendation from here,"So I bought this TI-36X Pro after reading a post here when I first started school for engineering. Algebra 2 at community college. I was 23, renting a tiny bedroom barely big enough for a twin bed from a friend, working nights waiting tables, broke, and sitting on a degree I knew I wasn’t gonna use.

Listen, it’s a great calculator but I have nothing new to add about its utility. I just didn’t realize how attached I was to it until it finally quit. I got weirdly sad about it, honestly. It’s been with me through every class, every exam, every job. Used it for statics, dynamics, vibrations, even stupid engineering economics, my EIT, my PE, all of it. It’s sat on desks in apartments, job trailers, libraries, offices, cubicles, coffee shops, maybe a couple bars too, and through every version of who I’ve been in my adult life.

When it died, it wasn’t really about the calculator. It was just one of those tools that stuck around through everything, quietly there through this whole journey called life. 

I wanted to share this here at [r/engineeringstudents](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineeringstudents) because I know there are people here who might be in similar spots and might appreciate knowing the juice is worth the squeeze.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762397801.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

With the government shutdown and many of our end of year morale/welfare financial goals short of achieved, (and our normal fundraising events were canceled due to said shutdown) some members of the unit have volunteered their days off to support achieving our goals. We will have a tent at Lorenzi park selling military patches, shirts, lanyards, keychains, stickers, coffee mugs, memorabilia, etc. (unfortunately we’re completely out of challenge coins ☹️) Every dollar going directly to service members who need it. 

I’m also organizing a food pantry for our 300+ member squadron, many of them lower enlisted. We will accept donations of non perishables to literally support our troops as this shutdown looms on. 

Monday Nov 10 and Tuesday Nov 11 (veterans day!) we will be set up from 8am-4pm. Look for a white pop-up canopy and a table. We accept cash, Tap-to-Pay, and Venmo. We hope to arrive full of merchandise and leave full of food!

Everything donated and sold would significantly help the morale and welfare of the unit. Unused food donations will go to other struggling units on base, or to food banks once this all blows over. If you can’t make it and wish to support, please drop me a DM. I appreciate your time and hope to see you next week, even if it’s just to chat!

1opnia6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1opnia6/i_lived_in_a_haunted_apartment/,I lived in a haunted apartment,"This happened to me on Halloween night of 2018 and has haunted me ever since that night. My girlfriend and I were renting a two bedroom apartment at the time, this apartment had an upstairs and a downstairs. I spent most of my time downstairs as that's were my computer set up was. The upstairs had a bathroom, our bedroom and the second bed room which my girlfriend turned into a room were she would store her clothes, do her makeup and had a fold out futon for when we had people over. We were not allowed to smoke in the apartment but I was a pot head so I just always opened the window in the second bedroom and smoked in there. I would like to preface that I had been smoking pot for well over ten years at the time of this incident and had what most would consider a high tolerance so me smoking weed didn't cause me to feel out of the ordinary, if anything it made me feel normal.

My girlfriend at the time worked night shifts at a restaurant so I was always home alone during the nights until around 10pm on most nights. I had just finished up my shift earlier in the night and came home to relax in my normal way, Smoke a joint and scroll on my phone while hanging with my dog in the second bedroom than go downstairs to play my computer down in the computer space. This must of been around 6 or 6:30pm so it had just gotten dark here on the east coast. I light up the joint and I smoked about half of it while spacing out endlessly scrolling Instagram on my phone while I had my dog sitting next to me with the window cracked.

All of a sudden I realize that my dog has been barking for about 20 seconds and has not stopped so that got me to lose focus on the phone and to what he was barking at. Directly in-front of me is the three drawer dresser with six drop handles on it that my girlfriend stored some of her clothes in.

When I looked up the top right handle was flapping up and down COMPLETELY on its own, I was in auto-pilot mode at this point so I got up and grabbed the handle to make it stop..When I did this my entire body went ice cold like I was in a freezer..at the exact moment everything clicked in my head and I realized what was going on. I let go of the handle and the moment I do..The handle starts flapping up and down again on its own, not rapidly but in a very rhythmic motion.

I could not bolt downstairs quick enough, I went into fight or flight mode and choose flight, when I got downstairs I realized my dog was still upstairs in the second bedroom barking at this dresser so with all my courage I went back up to grab my boy. When I get to the top of the stairs I see the handle is STILL flapping up and down. I run in, grab my dog and bolt downstairs in complete shock with everything that just happened.

I went into the living room and instantly called my friend to tell him what happened, just being on the phone with someone else made me feel secure, though I was still so scared. We must of been on the phone for hours until my girlfriend got home and I was able to tell her what happened up there..I was so scared to go back into that room from that moment on, though I still had to smoke in there. I would rush back down there the second I was done and ALWAYS kept the door shut so I didn't have to look in there when it was not needed. Our bedroom was next to this room so at night I would need to walk past it quite frequently.

A few days later I was talking to my neighbor who use to live in the apartment we were renting and asked if anything strange ever happened in there while she was renting it as she lived in there for over ten years. She told me in the room upstairs a young Lady had overdosed in the early 2000's. She also told me that her sister was sick at one point and was staying with her, until she passed away down stairs one day.

I only had a few other strange things happen to me in that apartment like my coffee mug sliding across the table about a foot or so while half full, but the dresser situation stuck with me since that day. Ive tried to make a rational explanation for that night but I simply can't. Things like having the window open..but there was no breeze, and even if there was why only the top right handle move? Why did my dog notice this before I did ? why did my body go ice cold.

I wish I had got this moment on film but in the moment that was literally the last thing on my mind. My girlfriend and I were so scared she ordered some sage and made us perform a seance. We put salt on all the windows, had them open and told whatever was in that apartment to leave and that it was our home now.

I will never forget what happened to me that night and it completely shattered what I thought reality was, I was always a believer but that just cemented it for me. ",2,1762397596.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

1opngm7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opngm7,Jeni’s,"Pistachio Macaron
Not exactly the exact flavor of a pistachio macaron. Definitely has that almond-y taste but leans more real pistachio flavor with tiny bits of pistachio through out. Powerful salty, nutty flavor. Would buy another pint.

Cranberry Panettone w Chocolate Sprinkles
Base is a mild, sweet flavor. Not overpowering. Sprinkles give good texture but little taste. The cranberry jam is the star and makes this ice cream slightly unique and special. I still prefer Jeni’s Cranberry Crumble which I believe was last released in 2023. It had more cranberry/tart flavor and felt more festive. Without the cranberry in this one, would be very “meh”. Would still buy another pint of this because I love cranberry. 

Boozy Eggnog
Like a lighter, milder version of eggnog with hints of liquor and spices. Very “milky” on its own but I think next time I’ll pair all 3 together and it might be better mixed with something else. If you’re expecting coquito flavor, this is not that in my opinion. Would not buy another pint. 

Cold Brew w Coconut Cream (non dairy)
I’d heard good things about this one so decided to try. It’s very much a sorbet but also creamy?! Not sure how they do that but this was good. Coffee flavor is strong on its own, slightly bitter but mixed with the white coconut cream, tastes like a really good frozen coffee. Sort of just want to melt this and drink it but I won’t do that. Probably would not buy another pint and would get a coffee instead to get my fix!

i find i'm not cooking much meat lately which is partially because of the price and also, if it's not the main feature, i really don't feel like it adds much to things.  for me, it seems like the meal is either all meat or no meat.  i don't see the point of mixing meat into things if it's going to be in the background and especially if it's just ground beef, which is where my price point maxes out.

i did, however, take out some ground beef from my freezer drawer to thaw and i'm planning on making the most dreaded meal in my repertoire: mashed potatoes with creamed corn and a hamburger patty.  this is what i had for dinner *way* too often as a kid.  like *way* too often.   there's nothing inherently wrong with it, to me at least, it's just the frequency it was made and eaten.  after a decade without it, it's really not that bad.  on the other hand, i might just enjoy a hamburger since i have buns and could use the potatoes to make a curry, but... we'll see.

1opnefc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Leather_6292/comments/1opnefc/this_chair_literally_saved_my_wfh_life_jones/,This chair literally saved my WFH life. (Jones Massage Executive Chair Review),"Alright, so I need to rave about this for a minute. I'm a graphic designer, and like a lot of you, I've been fully remote since... forever ago. My setup was decent except for one glaring, painful problem: my chair.

The old one I had was some generic ""executive"" thing from a big-box store. It looked fine, but after 8+ hours of being parked in front of Figma and Illustrator, my lower back was in open rebellion. We're talking a constant, dull ache that would flare up into a sharp pain whenever I shifted. I was popping Advil like candy and seriously considering a chiropractor. My focus was shot because half my brain was always dedicated to the discomfort.

I was desperate. I started digging for chairs that actually *actively* helped, not just had ""lumbar support"" as a bullet point. I stumbled on the **Jones Massage Executive Chair (2025 Upgrade)** from Kinnls and was kinda skeptical. Massage? Heating? Seemed gimmicky, but I was at my wit's end.

https://preview.redd.it/y117erdmvjzf1.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f42096b76f61b4e6ab0d5633de2c8765378e684

Guys. It is NOT a gimmick. This thing is a miracle worker.

Let me break down the two features that fixed me:

**1. The Massage Function:** It's got these vibrating nodes right in the lumbar area. You can control the intensity. When I feel that familiar tension building around 2 PM, I just lean back and hit the button. It's this deep, rhythmic vibration that just *unlocks* all the tightness. It's not a aggressive, jackhammer massage—it's more like a steady, soothing kneading. I can keep it on a continuous mode or set it to pulse. It's made those long crunches before a deadline actually bearable. I don't have to stop working; I just get a massage while I fine-tune my kerning. It's insane.

**2. The HEAT. Oh my god, the heat.** There's a heating pad built into the lower back. On days when my back feels especially stiff and cold, I turn this on. The warmth just seeps in and melts the pain away. It's like putting a heating pad on, but it's perfectly positioned and I don't have to mess with cords or a microwavable bean bag. Using the heat and massage together is the ultimate combo. It feels like my spine is getting a warm hug after years of being abused.

The difference after a month with this chair is night and day. The chronic pain is just... gone. I'm actually comfortable at my desk now. I'm more productive because I'm not distracted by my own body, and I finish the workday feeling tired from work, not crippled by pain.

**TL;DR:** Was a graphic designer with back pain so bad it was messing with my job. Bought the Jones Massage Chair for the gimmicky-sounding features. The massage and heating functions are 100% legit and have completely eliminated my back pain. Worth every single penny. If your chair is trying to murder your spine, do yourself a favor and check this one out.

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",1,1762396852.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Hey Maximizame crew,

Been thinking a lot about how we treat life like a video game. We're all just trying to gain XP, unlock achievements, and level up, right? But sometimes it feels like we're stuck on the same level, grinding away without making much progress.

For a long time, I tried to separate **productivity** from **happiness**. I'd hustle hard all day, feel burnt out, and then wonder why I wasn't happy. It took me way too long to realize they're not separate quests—they're part of the same main storyline. A happy brain is a productive brain, and a productive life often leads to a happier you.

Here are a few ""hacks"" I've picked up that have seriously helped me gain XP in both areas. No fluff, just stuff that actually works for me.

**For Crushing Your To-Do List (Productivity 📈):**

*   **The Two-Minute Rule:** This one's a classic for a reason. If a task pops into your head and you know it will take less than two minutes to complete, **do it immediately**. Answering that email, putting the dish in the dishwasher, making that quick call. It clears up so much mental clutter.
*   **Embrace Single-Tasking:** We've been sold a lie about multitasking. Trying to do five things at once just means you're doing five things poorly. Pick ONE thing. Set a timer for 25 or 45 minutes and give it your full, undivided attention. The focus is insane.
*   **Define Your ""One Big Thing"":** Before you even open your laptop, ask yourself: ""If I only get ONE thing done today, what will make me feel the most accomplished?"" Do that thing first. Everything else is a bonus.

**For Protecting Your Peace (Happiness 😊):**

*   **Schedule ""Do Nothing"" Time:** We schedule meetings, workouts, and errands. Why not schedule downtime? Put it in your calendar. 30 minutes to just sit, listen to music, or stare out the window. It's a non-negotiable appointment with yourself.
*   **Log Your ""Tiny Wins"":** Before you go to sleep, write down or just think of one small thing that went well that day. Did you enjoy your coffee? Did a stranger hold the door for you? Did you finally fold that pile of laundry? It trains your brain to look for the good.
*   **Master Your Inner Game:** This is the big one. All the productivity hacks in the world won't help if your mind is a chaotic mess. It's not about a single trick but about understanding your own emotional patterns. I found that having a structured plan to manage my thoughts and feelings was a game-changer. If you're feeling stuck on this, I really got a lot out of **this resource (affiliate link)**. It helped me build a solid foundation for my mental well-being.

Ultimately, leveling up isn't about some massive, overnight transformation. It's about the small, daily choices that stack up over time.

So, what are your go-to hacks? What are the small things you do to feel more productive and genuinely happy? Let's build a master list in the comments. 👇",1,1762396795.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I purchased the following during the recent 50% sale on the site:

02. Seven Samurai (1954) - Thick booklet containing eight essays from critics, historians and filmmakers 

97. Do the Right Thing (1989) - Thick booklet containing an essay, production photos and a facsimile of Spike Lee’s production journal 

396. Ace in the Hole (1951) - A one-sheet that folds into a decently sized newspaper with essays 

555. Sweet Smell of Success (1957) - Thick booklet with an essay, two of Ernest Lehman’s short stories about the characters and an excerpt from Alexander Mackendrick’s On Film-making book 

700. Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) - Thin booklet filled with production art & photos, an essay, an article by Wes Anderson and the White Cape comic Ash reads from the film

1030. Scorsese Shorts - Thin booklet with an essay and rarities from Scorsese’s personal archives

1opn5ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/WBAdventures/comments/1opn5ba/the_night_maple_crescent_changed/,The Night Maple Crescent Changed,"By the time the first howl rolled down Maple Crescent, Cole was already coughing hard enough that he had to pause the game.

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",2,1762396589.0,WBAdventures,0,1.0,False
1opn4w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1opn4w3/my_journey/,My journey,"My Year-Long Health Journey – Finally Looks Like H. Pylori

Hey everyone,
I wanted to share my story because it’s been a long, confusing year and I feel like I’m finally getting some answers. Maybe someone’s been through something similar.

How it all started

It all began around October 2024. I noticed swollen lymph nodes, a tight throat, and this weird feeling like it was hard to swallow. I got tired easily, felt drained all the time, and had constant body aches. All started day I went to GYM than my neck just cramped up I just felt weird and paranoid and next day I was with my friends and I was smoking weed and drinking energy drink and boom out of nowhere my throat just got tight out of nowhere got me scared, than from that day I stayed home thought I had an infection went to a GP he just said it’s just an infection I’m like Ok I waited 
A few weeks later, I developed ear ringing (tinnitus), random chest and rib pressure, mild gum bleeding, and occasionally spat up yellow or bloody mucus. 
Than I went to ER they told me to go to an GP so I went to a different one  and the GP prescribed Cilicaine VK (phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg) for ten days thinking it was an infection, but the symptoms didn’t really go away.

The weird unsteady feeling

After that I started getting this strange unsteady or light-headed feeling like my body was slightly off balance when walking. I saw a chiropractor and then an osteopath, who said it might be from tension in my neck and ribs. The osteopath did dry needling, and it actually helped loosen things up for a bit.
They also told me to walk daily, eat spinach, take magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc, and do light resistance training. I started doing that and noticed small improvements, but that unsteady feeling still came and went.

My lifestyle before all this

I’ll be honest before all this happened, I was a frequent weed smoker. I used to smoke daily, often on an empty stomach, and didn’t eat properly afterwards. I think that messed up my gut badly. My diet was all over the place, I barely ate proper meals, and I relied on coffee and cigarettes to get through the day.
Over time, I feel like that lifestyle triggered some kind of gut damage and inflammation, and my immune system started to crash.

Cause of that I’ve quit weed. 

Months of tests and confusion

From October 2024 through most of 2025, I went through countless tests blood work, rheumatology markers, throat and nasal swabs, and even a Monospot test for glandular fever. Everything kept coming back “normal” except my RF (rheumatoid factor), which was slightly high around 20 IU/mL both times (a year apart).
Doctors thought it could be something autoimmune, but nothing was conclusive.

By mid-2025 I had accepted that something deeper was going on — probably gut-related. I started focusing on gut healing: bone broth, black seed oil, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, and fish oil. I even did lymphatic drainage and started using colostrum and prebiotics to rebuild my gut lining. Please take black seed oil guys it’s very beneficial 

The H. pylori clue

Then around August 2025, i went to see a different GP ordered a urea breath test for H. pylori. The result came back “Low Positive (54 DPM, ≤ 50 is normal)”, which means there was definitely some bacterial activity. The doctor told me to repeat the test in six weeks  which still showed the bacteria was present, though not extreme. It made total sense. All my symptoms lined up  gut pain, random body inflammation, fatigue, nausea, even that unsteady feeling. Everything felt connected through the gut sometimes I feel sharp pain on my chest thinking it’s my heart. I was feeling like my joints and nerves around my arms and knees

Where I’m at now

As of today (November 2025), I’m on Day 4 of a 7-day triple therapy for H. pylori. The plan is to kill the bacteria completely and then rebuild my gut properly with prebiotics, probiotics, and nutrient-dense food. I’ve completely quit weed and caffeine, and I’m cutting back on cigarettes too. Haven’t smoked since started this therapy 

I’m eating clean, staying hydrated, and focusing on recovery — not just physically, but mentally too. I’ve realised how much the gut, nerves, and immune system are linked together. Do your sports, exercises gym whatever it is guys 

What I’ve learnt is don’t ignore chronic fatigue, weird gut feelings, or “invisible” symptoms.
Antibiotics help only if you fix your lifestyle afterwards — especially diet.
Weed, poor eating, and stress destroy your gut over time. Healing takes patience — supplements alone won’t save you if your habits stay the same.

If anyone’s dealing with similar symptoms — chronic inflammation, dizziness, random joint pains, throat tightness, or anxiety after gut issues please check for H. pylori. I wish I had earlier.",1,1762396554.0,HPylori,1,1.0,False

I guess I don’t mind it all that much since I’d rather put up with that con over feeling icky. I use Almond Breeze unsweetened original milk for my everyday homemade coffees and I never have that issue. Does Dutch use a different brand of almond milk that gives it that aftertaste, or does the almond milk just not mix well with the rest of the drink’s ingredients?

Katie’s Cars&Coffee is a car meet that holds every Saturday morning 6-9AM in Falls Church, VA. 

I am a hyper car enthusiasts, I found this is actually one of the most exotic Cars&Coffee event in the country (or at least east coast) and it is indeed crazy, you can basically find anything there and talk to the owners. Classic, Hyper-cars, JDM, American Muscle,Hot rod,Motorbike and even RC toys.
I post some pictures I took down below so you could check out.

It is hold in FallsChurch, VA, in front of Katie’s Coffee House,  (760 Walker Rd, Great Falls, VA 22066 ) unfortunately in early morning there is no public transport, it is about a half hour drive from foggy bottom, the uber bill is about $30-40 to the way there and $10-15 to the way back to the metro station (Wiehle-Reston Station) near by when we comeback. So it will be $40-55 in total.

If any of you guys are interested you could join this GroupMe chat,(The last picture above) I will leave in 6:30AM in District House, and maybe we could go together. 

You don’t necessarily need to go every weekend, just text me in the group chat that if you are going or not.

 Decided today to try making a baby blanket for a friend whose expecting next month. Itll be my first big project and boy am i already feeling the ache.

Im loving colour changing yarns and particularly like this one but does it actually look okay? what do you guys think before it gets too big? Im not 100% sure how to figure out the best way to get these kinds of yarn to work nicely into a pattern.  I like how it reminds me of a fancy coffee but its definitely not coming out quite like i expected.  The more i look at it the more unsure i feel seeing as its going to be a gift.

Part of me wants to scrap this for a solid colour until i know how to properly use colour changing yarn but, on the other hand these 9 rounds took me 4 hours.

In the case of 7-11, their Arabica coffee is actually pretty good.  I do sometimes upgrade to the select coffee.  I don't mind paying a little more if I actually enjoy the coffee.

However, I don't really care for Amazon's upgrade.  In my opinion, it tastes worse than their normal coffee.  Of course others might disagree and that's fine.

What I have a problem with, is that many, if not all Amazons are now defaulting to the premium coffee and slapping a 25 baht fee on top.  Every time I have to say, no I want the normal coffee.

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",1,1762395926.0,TheDarkArchive,0,1.0,False

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",1,1762395723.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

———

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days blur together like water running over glass. The clocks all say different things, and no matter how long I stay awake, the sun never sets the same way twice. 

Sometimes it fades, sometimes it stalls, sometimes it just blinks out like someone threw a switch. But I’ve stopped caring what time it is. The only thing that matters now is getting out.

The first thing I tried was walking. I filled a backpack with water, food, a flashlight, and left the car parked in front of the motel. I followed the main road out of town until the pavement gave way to gravel, then to dirt, then to nothing but pine needles. The air grew thicker the farther I went, like I was wading through it instead of breathing it. 

After a few miles, I stopped seeing the treeline altogether—just more road stretching ahead, perfectly straight. When I turned around, the town was already back in sight, the church steeple poking above the trees like it had never left.

The second day, I tried driving at night. I thought maybe whatever was happening only worked while the sun was up. I drove until the gas gauge hit empty, headlights cutting through the fog, but when the car sputtered out, I was parked in front of the diner again. 

The lights were off, but Edna was still inside, standing by the window with that same polite smile. She didn’t move when I honked. Didn’t blink. Just watched as I sat there, trying not to scream.

The third day, I started leaving marks—spray paint arrows on the asphalt, branches snapped in half, rocks stacked into crude little towers. Every time I circled back, they were gone. The town had smoothed itself over, neat and pristine again. Even the mud on my shoes would vanish if I looked away too long.

That was the first time I noticed something else: people calling me by name. The motel clerk said, “Morning, Jessie,” like it was the most natural thing in the world. I hadn’t told him my name.

When I went to the diner for coffee, Edna asked if I’d slept better last night. I told her I didn’t think I’d mentioned that I wasn’t sleeping. She smiled. “Oh, you must’ve. You always tell me everything, sugar.”

The way she said “always” made my skin crawl.

I left half the coffee sitting there and went to the gas station to ask Hank if there was another route—maybe a back road, maybe a dirt path out through the woods. He pointed at a wall map I could’ve sworn wasn’t there before.

A red line cut straight through town and looped around like a noose. At the bottom, scrawled in pencil, was a name I didn’t recognize. But Hank tapped it like it meant something to me.

“Your granddad helped build this road, didn’t he?”

I stared at him. “What?”

“Sure did,” he said cheerfully. “Helped lay the first gravel himself. You come from good stock, Jessie.”

I backed out without another word. When I turned around, the map was gone.

That night, I drove again. The sky was black this time, not the pale gray it usually was, and the stars looked wrong—too close, too many. I kept my eyes on the road until I saw the WELCOME HOME sign, its wood clean again, paint shining fresh under the headlights. For a second, I thought I saw movement behind it—a silhouette, human-shaped but not human still. When I blinked, it was gone.

I got out of the car and tried to tear the sign down. The wood felt soft and wet, like it had just been painted. When I pulled my hands away, the paint clung to my skin, red instead of white. I ran back to the car, drove until I couldn’t keep my eyes open, and ended up parked at the motel again. The clerk waved from the window when I stumbled inside.

“Rough night?” he asked. “You always did push yourself too hard.”

He said it like we were old friends.

I didn’t answer him. I went straight to my room, locked the door, and sat on the edge of the bed until the light started leaking through the curtains again. My hands still looked stained, the red gone darker overnight, like it had sunk under the skin. 

The mirror above the sink showed a man who hadn’t slept in weeks—eyes hollow, face drawn, jaw tight enough to ache. For a second, I thought the reflection was breathing slower than I was.

In a moment of weakness, frustration, and anger I reared my arm back and smashed the mirror with my bare fist. The sound barely echoed. 

For a second, I just stared at what I’d done. The glass had splintered in a spiderweb of cracks, thin lines radiating out from the point of impact where my knuckles had gone through. Blood slid down the glass in narrow threads, catching the weak yellow light like it was rust instead of red. 

My hand throbbed, pieces of silvered glass still stuck in the skin. I tried to wash it off, but the water from the tap ran cloudy, smelling faintly of metal. When I looked up again, the cracks in the mirror seemed to shift—like they were trying to pull together, to mend themselves around the reflection of my hand.

By the next morning, it was whole again.

That’s when I started testing everything. I left the motel with my phone recording video, drove out of town, turned the car around, and played it back. The footage showed the road leading out just fine—until it reached the woods. Then the screen flickered, the camera refocused, and suddenly I was driving past the diner again. I replayed it three times. The same thing happened each time, like a film reel stitched in a loop.

Later that afternoon, I parked in front of the church. The bell was silent, but I could feel the air vibrating around it, like the sound was waiting to happen. I went inside and looked at the painting again. The figure’s face was blank now—no eyes, no mouth, just smooth, unfinished skin. I took one of the candles from the altar and pressed it against the frame. Wax dripped across the image, thick and slow.

The next morning, the painting was perfect again.

Edna waved when I passed the diner. “How’s your mama doing, Jessie? You said she wasn’t feeling too good last week.”

I froze. I hadn’t spoken about my mom since I left home.

“I didn’t—” I started, but she just smiled that same gentle smile, tilting her head. “Sure you did, sugar. You must’ve forgot.”

I left without answering. I could feel her eyes on me all the way back to the car.

By the end of that day, I’d tried breaking every window on Main Street. Each one shattered under the tire iron, sharp cracks echoing down the block. I thought maybe if I wrecked enough of it, something would have to change. But the next morning, every pane was whole again. My arms were sore, my hands blistered, and the town looked untouched.

That was the first time I heard laughter. Not loud—just soft, somewhere in the air around me. Like a child’s giggle carried on the wind. It followed me down the street, through the gas station, all the way to the car. When I turned the ignition, it stopped.

On the fifth morning—if it was morning—I found mail in the motel’s drop box. A plain white envelope with no stamp. My name written neatly across the front. Inside was a photograph.

Me, standing beside Edna in front of the diner. The same pose, same angle as the one I’d seen on my phone’s background the first day. Only now, Hank and the sheriff stood in the background, smiling like a family portrait.

People greeted me differently after that. The man sweeping his porch called me neighbor. The kids on the bikes yelled my name before riding off. Even the sheriff tipped his hat and said, “Good to see you out and about again.”

Again.

I didn’t stop driving after that. I went through the woods, across fields, through backyards. The roads didn’t matter anymore; the town rearranged itself no matter which way I turned. Once, I crashed through a fence and ended up in someone’s garden, but when I looked up, the diner was across the street. The smell of frying oil filled the air, and Edna stood in the doorway, wiping her hands on that same rag.

“You’ll hurt yourself, sugar,” she said. “No need for all that fuss. You’re home.”

That word again. Home.

The car would be parked somewhere new—the gas station, the church, sometimes in front of the motel again. Each time, the fuel gauge reset to half a tank, no matter how far I’d driven. My hand had started to heal wrong, the skin along my knuckles tightening into pale scars that almost looked like lines of writing. When I stretched my fingers, it stung, but the pain was grounding. It reminded me I was still real, at least for now.

Sometime after what I think was the eighth day, I saw something different. The town square—if you could call it that—was crowded. People stood talking in pairs, kids played tag near the church steps. The air smelled faintly of cut grass and something sweet, almost like apples left too long in the sun. 

For a heartbeat, it looked normal. Then I realized every face was turned toward me. Not directly, not in unison—but each one found me eventually. Eyes following me as I crossed the street. Smiles widening. Nods exchanged like I’d just come home from work.

Edna waved from the diner window. Hank lifted his coffee in greeting. Even the sheriff was there, leaning against his car.

“Morning, Jessie,” he called. “Good to see you out early.”

I didn’t respond. I just kept walking, pretending not to notice that some of them were whispering my name, their lips moving in unison as they spoke.

By that afternoon, I found a new photo waiting under my windshield wiper. This one showed me standing in front of the church, wearing the sheriff’s badge on my chest. The ink was still wet when I picked it up.

That night, the bell rang again. Three times. I counted. The sound was deeper now, like it came from under the ground instead of above it. I looked out from the motel window and saw shadows gathering at the base of the steeple. Dozens of them, still as statues. When the last toll faded, they all turned toward me at once.

I drove. Didn’t even grab my bag this time. The headlights flickered as I tore down the road, past the diner, past the sign. The trees blurred together until they looked like a single dark wall. The air buzzed in my ears, thick with static. I thought I was making progress—I felt it. The odometer was ticking up, the temperature dropping, the fog thinning.

Then I saw someone standing in the middle of the road ahead.

For a second, I thought it was the sheriff again. But when the beams caught him, I saw my own face looking back.

He was dressed like me, same jacket, same bloodstained hand. He smiled faintly, raised a hand in greeting, and walked toward the diner on the right side of the road. I saw Edna open the door for him.

I don’t remember deciding to move. I just slammed the gas pedal. The car roared forward, trees whipping by, the engine screaming as I tore past the sign. The world seemed to twist for a moment—everything bending inward, folding itself around the sound of the tires on asphalt.

Then it was gone.

The trees opened into a wide expanse of gray sky, and ahead of me was a familiar stretch of highway. My phone buzzed in the passenger seat, the first service I’d seen in days. A green exit sign flashed by. I slowed down, shaking so hard my hands slipped on the wheel.

For a long time, I just drove without thinking—past billboards, past rest stops, until I saw another car again. A minivan with a family inside. The sight made my throat tighten.

When I finally pulled into a gas station, the world looked normal again. Real sunlight, real sound, the smell of fuel and hot pavement. I sat there until I could breathe without trembling. Then I glanced at my phone.

My lock screen had changed. It was a photo of me, standing in front of the diner. Only this time, I wasn’t smiling.

Behind me, through the window, I could see the other version of myself sitting at the counter, waving.

I kept thinking about him—the other me. The one who walked down the street like he’d been born there. He moved with this calm, unhurried ease, smiling when people called his name, laughing at things I couldn’t hear. The way Edna leaned toward him at the diner window, the way Hank clapped him on the shoulder—it was all so natural, like it had always been that way. I realized then that the town hadn’t been trying to keep me there. It had been trying to make me there. Each loop, each morning, every detail it learned about me was just another stitch, sewing me into its memory until I belonged. And now that it had what it wanted, I can’t stop thinking about why.",9,1762395685.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

We had talked a bit about our hobbies before, and we're both gamers. When she showed up, she had two packs of Pokemon cards. It was the Prismatic Eevee booster pack? It was just two packs, but she said she thought it would be fun to open a pack each/together, as a first-date thing, to see if our first date was lucky. I said sure. I wasn't really into Pokemon but was willing to play along. She opened her pack and got a holographic card for a Pokemon she wasn't a huge fan of. I then opened my pack, ended up pulling a holographic Sylveon. She was super hyped, said it was her favorite Pokémon, and one of the best in the set. I Googled it and found that it can be worth up to $300.

She asked if I was going to sell it. I said yeah, why not? Especially if it's highly graded. She got sort of disappointed and pouty. Kind of immature, imo. It was up to chance and it's not my fault she gave me the pack instead of keeping it for herself. She stayed and we had coffee, but you could tell there was a vibe shift and she was upset. She headed off quickly after and hasn't replied since.

Aug. 1: I decided to start keeping a journal after both my parents died, and I have no relatives or friends; I'm alone.



After the funeral, my therapist told me to get away from the city for a while. So here I am at Camp 47. It's a nice place, quiet, peaceful, and beautiful.



The closest town is about 30 minutes away at the base of the mountain. I have to set up camp now, so I'll be back in a bit.



Alright, I got the tent set up and a fire started. It was kind of weird while I was gathering firewood, I kept hearing something in the woods, it was probably just a deer, but I felt like



I was being watched, I don't know, maybe it's just my nerves from being alone out here. I'm going to grill some steak for supper.



Not going to lie, I had better steak; my dad always made the best at his cookouts. It's dark now, the fire is just glowing coals, and it's so quiet, too quiet, no crickets, no wind.



I cleaned everything up and hung my backpack between two trees so the animals can't get to it. It's 10:00 pm, I'm going to bed. Maybe tomorrow I'll go for a hike up the mountain.



Aug. 2: 2:00 am. There is something outside. I can hear something breathing; it sounds like Darth Vader, and it's walking on two legs. I have my bear spray next to me. I see a red light,



It's very dim, oh crap, it's coming closer. Ok, there was a loud siren on the mountain, and the thing grunted and ran away.



8:00 am, I didn't sleep the rest of the night, as soon as the sun came up, I unzipped my tent and looked around. There were footprints everywhere, not animal, but human footprints.



Maybe it was a forest ranger or something, I don't know why they would be up here at two in the morning. I'm going down to the town for breakfast; maybe the people down there know something.



I made it to a diner in town, and I ordered a coffee and some pancakes while I wait for my order I'll write down what I saw. A bunch of black suburban's came up the mountain as I was going



down, probably some kind of three-letter government agency lol. I asked the waitress if she had heard the siren in the woods last night. She said (Son, things are going on in those



woods that certain people don't want you to know) Like who and what? (The last guy to ask those questions disappeared for 3 weeks, and when someone found him, he had checked himself into



A mental asylum, he won't speak to anyone about what he saw.) Wow, ok, so I'll keep my mouth shut. What was that guy's name? ( I think his name was Quill, Tim Quill, some kind of freedom



journalist, he believed there was a secret government facility somewhere in the mountains.) Did you ever hear of Camp 47? (Oh yeah, I've heard of it, got mixed reports about it, some say



It's nice others say it's it was the scariest camping trip of their lives.) Why? ( Too quiet or things in the woods watching them. Most of the people going up there are teenagers with weed



And beer. The sheriff usually does a round up there about midnight.) Do you know if he was up there last night? (Don't know, you could ask him. he's over there at the coffee bar.)



Thanks for the info. She nodded and went to get my pancakes. I walked over to the sheriff and asked, Were you up at camp 47 this morning? (Yeah, why do you ask?) a sigh of relief left my



Mouth. Ok, good, I'm camping up there and heard something or someone outside my tent, but then you turned on your siren and it ran away. He looked at me with one eyebrow raised.



(I didn't turn on the siren last night. I don't know who did.) So you heard it too. (I did, looked for an hour or two, but couldn't find the source, never heard it before either.)



Do you think I'll be ok to stay there tonight? (Yeah, you should be alright. I'll do a couple rounds tonight.) I thanked him and went back to my table to eat my pancakes.



After I finished them, I went back to Camp 47 and decided to go for a hike. I made Shure to bring my bear spray and hunting knife. I think I'll leave my journal at my camp.



Ok, something weird is happening. I started hiking up the mountain, and I was about 2 hours into the hike when I ended up back at camp 47. I'm so confused, I guess I'll go down the mountain?

I made it to town. What is happening?",2,1762395563.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I've posted here before and had a few fun and interesting chats, even a few IRL dates, but I'm still looking for a real lasting connection. Anything real or worthwhile is hard to find in the sea of ""fakeness"" these days. That goes for real life and on dating apps. There's a lot of people who like to ghost and not say anything. It's unfortunate that a lot of people are so fake but I'm holding out hope that I can meet the right person either IRL or online eventually. :)

Let's actually normalize being genuine and nice to each other? \*mind blown

**About me:**

I'm a 30 year old average looking white dude with an average physique from North Carolina. I'm not hellbent on staying here either. In fact, I am actually looking to leave! I look pretty young and still get carded all the time, lol. College educated with a bachelors degree, a decent career in sales and own my own business. No debt or kids & financially responsible, but I love to have fun too.

I love camping/hiking and traveling! I think I've been to over 30 states! I love listening to music & playing PC games. Maybe we could play stuff together? I also enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks/podcasts. I would like to get a motorcycle at some point. I'm pretty easygoing generally. I'm also open to trying any new hobbies with my partner that they'd like to introduce me to. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too. One day, I'd like to have a house in the mountains with a few acres of land that is completely paid off.  Would be awesome to escape the ""system"" in small ways. Who wants to be on a debt treadmill their whole life? Not me! I'm 420 friendly but I don't really partake with the exception of the rare edible a few times per year just to relax.

Honestly I am a pretty social and goofy guy. I would describe myself as an ambivert. INTJ, dry/dark sense of humor, I love making people laugh when I can. A bit nerdy at times, mainly about PC games and history.

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to connect with someone worthwhile and sane between the ages of 22-35 with no kids. Preferably inside the USA! I like text chatting but calling is ideal and better in my opinion. Obviously I don't expect us to call right away but it's a much better way of actually getting to know you long-term.

I am a very dedicated and affectionate person in relationships, and really try my best even though I am nowhere near perfect. (Not even close.) I try to understand the other person I'm with to the best of my ability and be thoughtful and caring. I just want to find something peaceful with someone one day. I love hugs.

I want to be around someone who gives me peace and to be able to sit around a campfire with you sipping coffee and making smores or having a picnic having a deep hearty laugh. Maybe play video games together or go on a walk too. I'd love to feel completely comfortable around you. I would like to get to know eachother on a deeper level than ever before, if it feels right. I'd like to find someone who is okay with me showing emotions even though I am a guy. Someone I could take on cute dates and treat well. At this phase I am dating with the intention of finding someone worthwhile to keep around forever, where we can cheer eachother on with our goals in life whatever they may be. Honestly just looking for my best friend that I haven't met yet.

Anyway, that should give you a good taste of what you're in for if you decide to reach out. If you like the sounds of any of this, shoot me a message and we'll chat. :)

  
**Dealbreakers:** 

\- Kids (If you want them, it's fine, but if you already have them, then I'd rather not, sorry!)

\- Non-monogamy

\- I would strongly prefer dating someone within my own country but if you're amazing, I can make an exception.

At a long wooden desk, Gregory Pranzo leans over a half-finished prototype for a low-cost air quality sensor. His dog, Jasper, sleeps nearby. For Pranzo, this isn’t just a hobby—it’s part of a lifelong obsession with using technology to make his city smarter, safer, and more connected.

# From Curiosity to Career

Pranzo’s story begins in Lauraville, a working-class neighborhood where curiosity was encouraged, even when money was tight. His father, an electrician for Baltimore Gas & Electric, filled the basement with spare circuit boards and broken devices. “If you can take it apart and put it back together, you can fix almost anything,” his dad would say. That basement became Gregory’s first lab.

By 13, he was coding basic websites and competing in the Baltimore City Robotics League. At Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, he was known for showing up early to the computer lab before soccer practice, often staying late to test new software on the school’s aging desktops. His solar-powered water filtration project won him second place at the Baltimore City Science Fair, hinting at the blend of practicality and innovation that would define his future.

This is my burner account for other reasons besides posting here. I have IBS-C; on the worse side at that. I’ve had issues going to the bathroom for as long as I can remember, but it recently hit its worst about 3 years ago. I had gone almost all of January without a bowel movement. Normally an enema or over the counter laxatives would help and let me go for the day or two after taking them. Nothing had worked and I decided it was time to go to a specialist. I went to the specialist who put me on linzess and did a colonoscopy. My body didn’t even let me go on the medication you have to take when on the liquid diet for the procedure. I almost ended up in the ER with severe pain and bloating. 

The colonoscopy revealed nothing, but the linzess had me going regularly with troubles of being stuck in the bathroom for long periods. My boss at the time wasn’t liking that I was in the restroom so long (even with a bathroom excuse on file) so I went to get my meds reevaluated. After getting off of linzess, my body got used to everything after a couple months. 

I am still stuck in the same cycle, almost 3 years to the day, later and have no answers or permanent solutions. I’ve had bloodwork done to test for intolerances and none showed up. I recently went back to my specialist because my body has gotten used to another medication, and she said I could have hormonal issues. I’ve never considered my hormones could affect my bowels. 

I’m 21f and have never gotten my hormones checked. I only got my first papsmear 2 months ago. I am at a loss and feel miserable after every meal I eat. I don’t want to be on medication my entire life, but I don’t want to live in constant pain and discomfort. Things I’ve tried: miralax in apple juice, upping my fiber intake (makes me more bloated), suppositories, enema (the only thing that stays constant in my life), different prescriptions given by my specialist (amatiza, linzess on 3 different doses, and trulance), coffee, and others that I may not be recalling at the moment. I have been tracking my calories and have not lost weight in about 2 months (that I’m aware of because I do not keep a scale). My doctor has suggested elimination diets, but my blood work says I’m not intolerant to anything. 

Is my specialist not doing enough? Are there other things I can try? Could my hormones be causing this issue? I’m at a loss and hope this isn’t how the rest of my life will look.",1,1762395347.0,WomensHealth,1,1.0,False

This has left me very confused as just a few days earlier she was thinking of when to get our matching tattoos (which she has been trying forever to convince me to get), we did matching costumes, I was trying to plan a concert for us to go to, and the day before and of we were hanging out just fine laughing and talking one on one. 

  
We became friends in 6th grade and after a year became pretty much inseparable and very very close. We went through all of our phases together from losers in middle school, to getting into drugs and relationships with older people in highschool, to being single in highschool and always hanging out. We were together so much and her family felt like my family they truly do. She has always had mental health problems with cutting herself since middle school, ive watch her slowly progression from a drinking problem to her current day alcoholism, she stood at a bridge ready to jump, she deals with constant depression, and heavy insecurity issues. While ive had my own problems they were never as bad as hers but i still understood that she is a person that needs help and would really try not to hold things against her. 

When i went off to college things obviously changed because of the distance. She decided to move to a certain city thinking that once i transfered to a specific college we would be together. During this time is when she became a very heavy drinker and suicidal and I became very worried for her well being. I eventually reached out to her family, had a few phone calls with some of them, and convinced her to move back home. This wasn't the best thing to happen because her and her mother fight awfully but it was the only place available. 

She has since dropped community college because she was consistently fail all her classes. I kept pushing her to follow her dreams of being in a art related field. Youtube or on instagram or something. When she wanted to open a business i brought us to a late night cafe and tried to help her plan it out. But she doesn't do any of it. She is a very very lazy person. 

I am in my senior year of college with plans to do a doctorate degree while also working. I also partake in my social life with my roommates. I am constantly tired and have never been lacking so much energy. I dont think she fully understands how tiring school can be when it is taken seriosly. Even in middle school and high school I would help her finish her assignment. 

  
Ive been thinking for awhile to not be her friend and here is why (whenever i talk about a boy  it is the same one, her ex)

\-we went to an emo night one time (I planned and drove us there), since we were under 21 we could not buy drinks but she wanted some so she insisted we stood in the back until a man offered to buy us one. No man was coming up and I wanted to be in the crowd, she disagreed and kept insisting we waited. I made a comment about how i understand she really wants to drink but i want to be in the crowd (i said it in a way that sounded condescending or very rude). The night went on and we kinda split up when she went to the bathroom. I eventually found her sitting with three people and i joined too. We were all talking and eventually one guy said ""idk if i like you or not"" which was odd to me. I forgot how I found out but I belive during the ride how she told me why she was upset (about what I said) and i apologized because I didnt realize that drinking comment would upset her. She had told those people about me and I did not appreciate that because why would she do that and then allow me to sit with them when they have this preconceived notion that I was a mean friend.

\-She forgot my birthday but called to talk about a boy, a birthday that I have been talking and planning with her

\-I got her a christmas gift i thought she was really going to like, I was excited to give it to her. She did get me a gift, she said it was coming in the mail, which i knew as her way of saying she did not get it yet (i actually finally got it last month and it was lube and a thing to smoke out of). The next month was her birthday adn she was very very sad no one did anything to celebrate. I invited her to come up and i spend $300 on decorating my apartment, having my roommate make her a cake, getting several different presents to feel like she opening alot because I knew being 21 should feel special. She was late coming up on saturday and sunday she decided to leave early for a boy. This already made me upset because we have very little time together and I just did something so nice for her that no one else did. I helped bring down all the presents to her car and while putting it in I saw the christmas present i got her on the floor of her car. Her car is constantly dirty. It felt like shit to put more present in her car with my christmas present just sitting there so she can leave early for a boy. 

\-I invited her and her cousin and her little brother to swim as my house. we got drinks and had fun. I can not remember exactly how this happen but she got very drunk and insisted no one wanted her there and to just go home. She got in her car very drunk and kept telling her cousin and little brother to go. I tried to drag her out but I could not. eventually her cousin and little brother got in adn she drove a but down the street until her cousin called me because him and the little brother were scared. She had ran into something and damaged her car. I ran down my street and get the cousin and brother and brought them back to my house where we sat on the edge of the rode waiting for the uber I got them. When they got home she was hysterically crying to her mom about how i don't want to be her friend anymore. The next day i showed up to talk to her because I knew she had a drinking problem and I knew she was depressed and I didn't want to not be friends. We made up.

\-One time when i was home form college we were going to hang out for a weekend (Saturday and sunday). I made us coffee sunday morning and had plans for us that i was excited for. I was ready and she knew I wanted to do stuff. She was one theh phone with a boy for three hours. When she finally decided to hang up I told her I was upset and rather her go home. I eventually started crying. She went home adn later showed back up to apologized. We made up

\-I believe this was a summer when i was home. We planned for me to spend the night at her parents place. I went over at the time we agreed one and i waited awhile since i knew she had a boy over but we planned to spend the night together. She eventually came to my car, told me he was tired, and that i had to leave

\-on thanksgiving i was invited to hers. I prepared a dish for it. I planned to go after mine but eventually she stopped texting me and based on the context of the text we sent each other i thought she was having a very serious and needed conversation with her sister in law. I was okay with that. I later found out it was because she brought a boy over. I was not okay with that.

  
Heres some things i have done for her

\-got her anime convention tickets (she has always wanted to go)

\-took her to a cat cafe as a surprised because i knew she was depressed and needed something to cheer her up. She loved it.

\-found and took her to an anime store just to surprise her

\-get her whole family christmas gifts and birthdya gifts if im around

\-at her first apartment i made her desk while she was asleep because i knew she wouldnt 

She changed when her ex boyfriend came back into her life. She is in love with him. He told his mom she is not his future wife. They are neighbors now at an apartment complex. They plan to move to a different complex but still not in the same apartment. He use to have sex with her and now he does not. He shames her about alot. She has cried to me about him alot. I do not like him. She does not like that. Her family loves him but does not know everything i know. I do not tell her family, instead i take their criticism of me to save his reputation because she wants him around. Again these are people i saw as my own family. What were their criticism? That i was jealous and wanted him. This hurt me very very bad. Instead of believing that the girl they have know for years, that they've celebrated so much with, the they trust so much, they maybe I do not like this guy for valid reasons they instead believed that i wanted him. I did not want to even be in the same room with this guy. They thought that I would stab my best friend in the back and throw her away for this guy. And i have still said nothing. 

I have told her i have lost respect for her and i think it is pathetic how she lefts this man treat her. I said this after she hit him and he left early from her parents wedding. And i still sat there with her so she could have someone to talk to. I also sat with her when he left her fathers birthday early and she got upset. Both times i really really tried to get along with him for her sake. 

  
After writing all of this i am going to block her. I came to this realization when i saw a tiktok she reposted that says ""when bro finally leave that evil bih and we genuinely feel more locked in than ever so we level up and start hitting ts"" knowing her i strongly feel like this is me. I just can not forgive her again.

The night of halloween i kept micromanaging her to make sure she got to my place on time which she got annoyed with but i could nit have her be late. It is midterms for me i did a test that morning, had work that night, and trying to make sure she was here. I was stressed. On the street with bars i kept leaving her behind to walk with my roommate up front but my other roommate kept walking with her and the roommate i was walking with gets easily upset and i could tell she was already on edge and i was trying hard to appease her. My BFF probably thought i was just leaving her behind. The rest of the night was good. The next night was a party i was throwing and people showed up earlier than expected, i was not ready, i was tired, and i get nervouse when i mix freinds because i dont want anyone to have a bad time. I was stressed and got quiet, she made a snide comment about it to do with another friend, i said i was stressed but that was it. We went out with some friends but eventually it was just me and her. I was so so tired and my little brother with his friends were walking around, i didnt know where my other friends were and i was stressed. When 1:50 rolled around i made us leave because the bars would close soon. I guess i ignored people because she started yelling at me about ignoring them. She eventually started yelling at me about how i always have to be right but then it turned into i alway am right so i dont know which one she meant because i feel like they mean different things. She was saying she has been thinking we shouldn't be friends and after this we shouldn't be friends.  I truly didn't know how we got there because i was drinking. I just started crying because i felt like i was with my ex and i could get that out of my head. I have never felt that way where i felt i was in the moment when me and my ex was arguing. She started apologizing because i was crying but i just could not talk or acknowledge her because i just kept thinking about how it feels like it did when i was with my ex. I dont remeber the car ride back. She said shes going home (a two and half hour car ride) and i said to just stay the night but i didnt fight her went she packed and left because i decided to sit down on the couch with my roommate and some friends to do karaoke. All i could remember if is i was determined to not let my night be ruined. She left and i went to sleep when my little brother got home. We have not talked.

  
I know i need to block her. I know she was my best friend and no longer is. I know i dont want to because she is the only person that truly knows me and we have so much fun together and have so many memories. I am so sad. She is truly who i saw being old with drinking coffee on our porch. I don't know why she did this.

I don't even have time to process all this or go through the emotions because i am so so so so so busy and i have some much to get done. I don't know i just needed to get this out. I need to go block her now. Why did this happen.",1,1762395333.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I’m from Peru and a few months ago I started importing small batches of iPhones (5 or 6 units) from eBay in the United States and reselling them in Latin American countries, mostly in my own.

It worked surprisingly well. After a few rounds, I made around $3,000 USD in profit (about S/11,250 soles). That experience showed me that international trade really works if you understand pricing, logistics, and demand.

Now I want to take it to the next level. I want to open a company in the United States that allows me to
• export Peruvian products like maca, cacao, and coffee
• import tech products under better tax and logistics conditions
• operate fully legal while minimizing taxes using the right structure

I’ve read that forming an LLC in Wyoming, Delaware, or Florida could be a good start for foreigners, but I’m not sure which state offers the best tax advantages and simplicity for exports.

My question to you:
For someone outside the United States who wants to build a small export import business, what’s the best way to open a US company that reduces taxes legally and avoids double taxation between countries? Any tips or personal experiences would really help.

1opmoh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1opmoh1/curious_about_coffee/,Curious about coffee,"Several months back i was traveling with some friends. We stayed a couple nights at an airbnb and the host had left out a fresh bag of local coffee. We had used some of it, but not all. My friend ended up packing it up and taking it with her. I asked why she was doing that and she said something along the lines that it was there for us to use and take.

Maybe there was something in the listing that said to take it, but I felt funny. I feel some hosts would be like ""sure, take it"" and that more hosts would leave it out for the next group, or use it themselves. However, she is generally a quite thoughtful and considerate person, so I'm questioning myself. I think also that I may go out of my way to travel more frugally than she does, so possibly she's used to staying in places a step up from where I usually stay. 

I also tend to be excessively focused on fairness and not taking things that aren't meant for me or should only be taken sparingly, to the point that I may avoid taking things that legitimately are meant to be used or taken. 

So, what are your perspectives on the coffee conundrum? To take or not to take?

If it matters, it was a two bedroom place. It was quite nice and well decorated. It was about $250/ night for the place, including all taxes. ",5,1762395294.0,airbnb_hosts,29,0.73,False

(Part 1)","Before I begin, please know that I have not had any psychological issues for years. Day to day, I work as an attorney and am even running for office. I am a normal person. A good person even. I am hoping that someone here can help me figure out where the music is coming from.

I woke up precisely at 7:55 like I have every morning I can remember. I haven’t needed it since I turned 13, but I always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for my phone to turn it off, I remembered the dream I was having. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

I know I have never been to this park. I doubt anyone has been to a park like that since the 1950s. But I’ve had recurring dreams of it—first when I started my senior year of high school and now again since Bree started my campaign. But it still feels deeply familiar. Like a park that I might have visited when I was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream now, I think it ended differently this time. I can’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke me up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When I picked up my phone, I had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out my schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. I know that my days will grow longer as the election approaches. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seems easy.

I put my feet down on his apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite my bed. I turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty is still hosting. She may look like a Great Value Miss America anymore, but she is still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seems to be permanently strangling her gray roots.

“Good morning, Mason County!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” I let some air out of my nose. Dotty’s jokes have not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Mason County’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Senator Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist has done a good job. I barely recognize myself in the photograph. When I look in the mirror, I see a too tired and too skinny nerd whose hair is too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, the glasses I am always anxious about keeping clean actually make me look smart. Especially next to my wrinkly plum of an opponent. I don’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Mikey’s campaign, led admirably by his sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And his themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” I can’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of our parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree has done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Mason County Community College’s budget, I showered and shaved. I put on my Monday coat and tie while the frumpled weatherman tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant. When I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Mikey and Senator Pruce. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, I grabbed my coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find my door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, I paused for just a moment. I reminded myself that I am happy. I graduated from an Ivy League school. I opened my own law office. I am running for office. And my parents, according to their Facebook posts, are proud of me.

Using the mindfulness techniques that my therapists have taught me, I brought myself back to the present. I turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” I recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person is a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, I found myself thrust back into memory of this morning’s dream. I remembered that I was stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then I remembered the sight that I saw right before opening my eyes. The material I was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum I used to get at church. I know the park dream happens when I am stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

I caught myself. It was time to work. Once I got to the office, I worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. I even found something to like about billing hours. I am fortunate. Unlike most of my law school classmates, I actually like being a lawyer.

Or I did. As I brought in more and more work, my family had started to help me. My mother emails to make sure I am keeping at a healthy weight. My father has Bree check in to make sure I am making enough money. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise me on which clients and cases I should take. Of course, none of these suggestions are optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, I prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since I am one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never know what kind of client or case these meetings are going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I can’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I can’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I have been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Jaunty. Sweet. But I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a smiling face.*

*It will make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone. I cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where I could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for me to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and my family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, I could just *be*.

By the time memory had taken me to junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, I had arrived at my campaign office. That is probably not the right word. It is more the building that my campaign office is in. The building that was the town civic center some decades ago. Now it’s been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees is the daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It has been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when I opened the doors. Before either of us said anything, Bree gave me a flash of a smile. We always have this moment. Before we start talking about the campaign or our careers or what we can do better, Bree looks at me like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. I remember this smile from our childhood, but it became fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since our father informed us that Bree would be running my campaign, the smile has only come in these flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I love her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

We sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She runs these meetings like she is reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Sometimes I wonder if she rather would be. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She has always been too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

I nodded at the right time. I wanted to pay attention. Bree worked hard to prepare this report, but it is hard to focus when I know my opinions don’t matter. Bree makes the decisions for the campaign, and the polls make the decisions for Bree. I hate myself for being so cynical, but I am a politician now. I am just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

When Bree started to explain the campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, I heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. I decided I wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Scarnes and Blumph, your publicists.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

My decision failed me. I was definitely hearing something. I told myself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite me. I looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

I tried my best to look focused. I am always trying my best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

I fought to keep breathing, but the air was leaving me. The music, now all around me and getting louder, was almost suffocating. I was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

My nerves began to demand my body move. First my fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then my feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.

At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at me like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” I felt like I was shouting, but I know I was using my inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, I asked, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as I had feared. Worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, I pivoted. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “But I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday.”

Bree haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, and I remembered. The song is called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it is from *Sunnyside Square*. I think it was my favorite show as a kid. But, after I heard the song in my office and then in Bree’s, I texted a few friends about it. No one remembers it.

Does anyone here? It aired in Mason County in the 90s, and that was the theme song. I don’t remember anything else right now. Writing this, I hear the music starting up from the apartment behind me. I live at the end of the hall.",1,1762395181.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Years later, my body still rejects him. There's no overcoming this?","We got together pretty young, back in 2019. It’s been six years now. I was 19 and he was 17. I was a virgin and he wasn’t.



During the pandemic, my dad got very sick. He had cancer and later developed a brain disease. He spent months in the hospital, in the ICU. When he finally came home, he was bedridden and not fully lucid. Later, he got pneumonia and was close to dying. I was completely devastated. My dad was my best friend... I was daddy’s little girl.



Seeing him sick and later losing him was the hardest thing I’ve ever faced.



At that time, I was studying hard to get into law school and emotionally falling apart. My sex drive was low (not gone, just... low). One day, while I was sad and talking to my boyfriend about how scared I was that my dad would die, he started groping me, trying to initiate sex. Literally as I said, “I’m afraid my dad will pass soon.”



He was 17, so I told myself it was immaturity, hormones, lack of awareness. But that kind of behavior had already been a pattern. He would often try to “get me in the mood” after I’d said no... asking to touch me, to undress, to do things to me even when I said I wasn’t up for it. I often gave in because I didn’t want him to feel rejected or undesired. I thought that was what a good girlfriend was supposed to do.



The last straw was that day when I was grieving and he still tried to get off. I told him I was done. I even told him I almost fell in love with another person who used to be there for me., at the time. Said that I was falling out of love, that what he was doing made me feel coerced and violated.



He forgave me for emotionally cheating and I forgave him for the above.



To his credit, he stopped immediately and has somewhat respected my boundaries ever since. He almost never initiates sex and I do just because when I don't, I feel bad about it. It’s been four years, and he’s never crossed that line again. He uses to make little comments to see if I'm open to it or not.



But something inside me is still broken, even after all that time.



Ever since, I’ve never truly felt physical desire for him again. I'm almost repulsed, even. I fake it. The arousal, the orgasms, the interest. I say I need lube because of birth control, but the truth is, I just don’t get wet. I don’t want to be touched. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve become asexual.



Outside of that, we’ve grown apart too. I’ve become an adult. I graduated, became a lawyer, I work, pay bills, run errands, handle responsibilities. Meanwhile, he still lives like a teenager. He’s in an IT program, plays video games all day, and does his homework. That’s it. He doesn’t drive, doesn’t take public transportation, doesn’t cook, doesn’t clean his room, and has literally never been grocery shopping in his life. His mom takes him everywhere.



When I imagine living with him, I don’t feel excited . I feel anxious. The thought of sharing a life or a home with him feels exhausting. I know I’d end up carrying everything - emotionally, financially, practically - and I already feel drained just thinking about it.



So why do I stay?



I figured a miserable sex life was the price to pay for having a somewhat great partner, on the other areas?



I mean, he’s not a bad person. He’s caring, patient, gentle, affectionate, calm, is always there for me when I need him to. He’s loyal, and he genuinely tries to please me in bed (I promise, trust my word on that, so I don't have to get into too much details, TMI), even though I have to fake it. He’s calm and never pressures me anymore. He learnt how to cook rice, pasta and make coffee for me. He tries to make me feel loved by my love language (acts of service). I know he loves me and I do care about him... but it feels like brotherly affection, not romantic love.



I love hanging out with him for a short amount of time. Not the entire weekend.



I’ve realized I’m staying mostly out of guilt and fear: guilt for hurting him, fear of regretting it, fear of being alone. I keep hoping he’ll change, grow up, become independent… but when he takes small steps in that direction, I just feel nothing. Not pride, not attraction... just impatience.



I think I’ve already emotionally left the relationship, but my body and mind haven’t caught up yet. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to marry him out of habit and spend the rest of my life pretending to want sex or affection. I don’t think this is how love should feel, even after years together.



I''m currently on therapy



TL;DR: About 4 years ago, my boyfriend would low-key coerce me into being intimate by groping me and asking me to strip even after I said I wasn't on the mood. I used to give in, but the last straw was when he did dad literally as I was talking about how afraid I was about my sick dad passing away. I talked to him about it and he hasn't done it ever since, but I still feel repulsed and obligated every single time... I just want it to end as soon as we start being intimate.

A couple days before the date she ghosts. Ok whatever I move on. Before she ghosted i added her on Snapchat through quick add, she never accepted but again whatever. A week goes by and she adds me back and we start talking again. Everything is going really well. We are flirting and theres Cleary a good vibe and flow with the conversations. We hadn't scheduled a new date because it was Halloween weekend and she said she was busy but we kept talking. So one day she says her job is changing buildings and they took the coffee machine. I offered to bring her coffee because she only worked 5 minutes from me and I was really digging her so I wanted to meet her. She at first said no saying that she would feel bad saying ""hi,thank you,bye"". I made a joke about being happy with kiss as a thank you. Standard cheesy flirting. So before I left work I shot her a text saying ""last chance I'm leaving work"" and she said yes. So I bring her coffee and clearly we are digging each other like I suck with this stuff and even I understood. So I made a joke about the kiss before I left and she leaned into the car window and kissed me. Afterwards we made jokes about it and kept talking. Then 2 days later just ghost. Still looks at my stories on Instagram and stuff like that but no responses. So I'm genuinely just confused you ghost once and reach back out to me,then flirt,then kiss me and then just dip? I honestly dont know what to think here so if I could get some feedback that would be dope. I keep getting ghosted and it really feels like somethings wrong with me.

1opmgy8,https://i.redd.it/7lvkv9yfnjzf1.jpeg,"When other game characters come to Earth in the movies, which humans should they live with?","Inspired by [this post on the main Sonic sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1op1sjb/i_cant_wait_for_tom_and_maddie_to_get_an_aneurysm/).

I said it before and I'll say it again: the Wachowski household is fully capped with Sonic, Tails, & Knuckles. Plus, the top comment on the above post said other Green Hills residents should pitch in to take care of any remaining aliens. I think that'd be really cute and wholesome. So here's which human I suggest every other Mobian should stay with:



Amy: Rachel. Assuming Amy's the same age as Sonic in this universe, she'll likely need a guardian just like him. Both her and Rachel are bold fireball-types who could bond pretty well. There's also Crazy Carl and they could bond over their love of dangerous hardware tools lol.



The Chaotix: Wade. [I already made a post about why Wade should join Team Chaotix, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheMovie/comments/1kkgm0t/hot_take_wade_should_be_the_chaotixs_human/)so naturally they should move into his place as well. Can't decide whether Vector and Wade fighting over splitting the rent or Vector just being Wade's subtenant is funnier. Either way, Wade adopts Charmy and becomes part of a platonic throuple with Vector and Espio lol. 



Big: Crazy/Super-Observant Carl. Imagine all the hilarity that would ensue from Carl trying to teach Big about all the real-life conspiracies in the world only for Big to blink and ask if he wants to go fishing. 



Cream: No human to live with; just her mother. I assume her mom would come with her to Earth and that once humans get use to more aliens visiting, some realtor in Green Hills will be kind enough to give Vanilla a deed/lease. Hell, if Amy really wants to stay in Green Hills to be close to Sonic, she could move in with Cream and Vanilla. Of course the place Vanilla gets would be on the same block as Wade's house for *obvious* reasons. 



Team Dark: Agent Stone. I don't know who first suggested Stone should join Team Dark, but I'm here for it. Once Stone buries the hatchet with Shadow, I could see him also bonding with Rouge and Omega and offering all three a place to stay. Though there would be a lot of funny fights between them: Shadow and Stone would argue over the best coffee recipes, Stone would tell her Rouge [her taste in men is trash](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1nrie11/comment/ngf5o96/?context=1), and Omega would hurt Stone's feelings by shit-talking all of Eggman's other robots.

Itinerary:
Day 1: After lunch in Liuzhou, drive to Yangshuo → Check into hotel → Rent an electric scooter on the street → Ride to Yulong River for sunset → Enjoy beer-steamed fish → Explore West Street on scooter → Have Guilin rice noodles → Return to hotel for sleep

Day 2: Woke up at 4:30 AM to drive to Xiangong Mountain for sunrise → Drove to the fishing village pier → Took a 5-yuan ferry across the river to see the iconic Xingping 20-yuan note scenery → Took the ferry back, then drove to the hotel for breakfast → Tried to rent an e-scooter for Yulong River rafting (gave up after waiting an hour due to crowds) → Ate bamboo-tube chicken → Returned to the hotel to catch up on sleep until 4 PM → Drove back to Guangzhou
	
On the Scenery:
Driving into Guangxi reveals uniquely striking mountain landscapes, especially after exiting the Yangshuo highway. We headed from West Street to watch sunset, with stunning views along the entire route. Highly recommend navigating to Xiatao Pier—a small bridge nearby makes for great photos, and you can splash in the water there. You'll also pass Rice Field Coffee, another photogenic spot.
For sunrise at Xiangong Mountain, check the weather forecast beforehand. Skip it if it's not clear—the viewing platform gets overcrowded and the view is mediocre. Just wake up to enjoy the daytime scenery instead.

Food and Accommodation:
The top recommendations are beer-braised fish and bamboo-tube chicken. I found the beer-braised fish pretty average, while the bamboo-tube chicken was decent. Compared to Liuzhou, this place is a culinary wasteland—even the street-side Guilin rice noodles taste ordinary. So! I’ll add a tip: stay at a chain hotel with free breakfast. There are plenty on West Street. After watching the sunrise, you’ll have breakfast sorted, with more variety than street stalls, then hit the sack for a nap.
Also, I need to rant about a local homestay that made me want to vomit blood and blacklist them: They advertised free parking, but it was a lot a kilometer away. The stairs to the fifth floor were super narrow. The curtains offered zero light blocking. When I went to bed, I found live bugs in the sheets. It was like stacking all the worst possible things on top of each other. The owner refused to switch rooms and only offered to change the bedding. After failed communication, I had to request a refund in the middle of the night and find another hotel. The owner acted like I was bothering her sleep, practically telling me to get lost. This experience alone could fill eight hundred words of complaints...
	
Cost breakdown:
Fixed expenses: Xiangshan Mountain entrance fee 60 RMB, bamboo rafting 100-200 RMB (varies by pier, distance, and price);
Food is very affordable—dishes like beer-braised fish or bamboo-tube chicken cost 60-100 RMB per person, vegetarian Guilin rice noodles are 5-6 RMB, and bubble tea prices are similar to Guangzhou;
Renting a basic electric scooter during summer costs 30-40 RMB/day. Note return times vary (6 PM vs. 11 PM). Shop around and haggle—we got ours for 20 RMB/day both days.
Accommodation: The chain hotels mentioned above cost around 300-400 RMB per night. Since we checked in late at night, booking directly onsite got us a slight discount plus a late checkout.

In short, Yangshuo is a stunning place—perfect for enjoying the scenery! Just remember to protect yourself from the sun! I applied sunscreen three times a day and still got sunburned.

How will you choose which is the best community in the space?

It's hard to and this is why I think Kendu's IRL efforts will be revolutionary, AI and bots are pretty much damaging the ability to discern between good projects on social media, look around: all memes are AI, likes can be botted, videos can be AI generated.... the list goes on.

IRL efforts however cannot be faked and are the greatest and most complete **Proof of Humanity**

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts: Energy drinks, coffee, merch, murals....

Many projects will be dying and honestly I would get out of any projects you aren't confident in, things are collapsing pretty rapidly and tbf it is a much needed cleansing of the market. But you wanna go into projects that will survive and keep building because those will be the ones that reach the billions when the market turns positively(and it will).

Although I have commented on social media efforts not being as relevant as they were in the past, Kendu is not ignoring them, with Kendu being the undisputed champions on Reddit and Stocktwits, whilst also having a very strong presence on X, Instagram and TikTok.

We are literally the strongest projects community wise on social media and IRL, this isn't gonna go unnoticed and imo it is clear where Kendu will go

My advice to you would be to join the Telegram or subreddit and ask any questions that you want, no such thing as a stupid question. As always DYOR, but to me my belief is unshakeable and I have looked at other projects around in the space!

Maybe you might agree with me

My boyfriend helped pay for a soldering kit and some DIY tech kits, I have done two, but they don't work at all. One gets electricity but not enough and the other kit gets power to the switch and then can't go through to the capacitors or resistors. I have two more kits left but I'm just really bummed that I couldn't get the other two right despite troubleshooting for so long.

We started going to library, we borrow a book like once every three weeks. We read to each other, when possible, like bedtime, or after dinner, he's even read to me while running errands.  He likes drama or thriller, I personally like Non-fiction about sociology, psychology, stem. This is fine, but I want to do something more hands on.

I have started going to the gym again and doing a deficient, this is to lose weight but also build endurance so I can justify getting a bike. My boyfriend was going to buy my one but Australia just hit summer so I admitted that I probably wouldn't use it in this heat. And he's been stressed about money. The gym is only $22 AUD a fortnight and I get to take my boyfriend as a guest when he wants. I've currently lost 1kg in 1 week! Yay for water weight!

I don't really have time for volunteering; my partner does it for SES (State Emergency Service) and he has to commit full weekends and 3-4 hours after work fortnightly. I just couldn't deal with that type of commitment and pressure. The other volunteer jobs ask for experience, and I don't have any sadly.

I used to do photos (amateur model) for Instagram just for fun, but the weight gain has made me insecure and clothes are expensive.

I do like coffee, but a machine and tools are just so expensive.

I have thought about sewing clothes, but I have no idea where to start, the only success I've had with needles is buttons. I have crocheted in the past (messed it up so many times ha-ha), but I type for work so sometimes I get cramps when I do too much with my hands.

I have a pool (not massive, kind of small), but I go to university and work, so by the time I get home it's too cold. I also work weekends (I am hoping to resign from this job soon).

I am fine with socializing but generally am an introvert when I get the choice. So, team sports or book club isn't really what I'd go for.

I used to game, but I got really badly addicted to it. I have a PS5, but I just can't help but think of other things to do when I play it.

I have learnt a few different styles of shuffling, and games for card decks, I even started collecting design decks, but it gets pricy after a while.

I used to do tarot readings for family and friends, but tarot readings can get very personal, so I stopped. I did try to do it online, but it has a bad rep. Also, I think I've grown out of that community. Also, the card decks are so expensive, I get so sad lol. I also hate to admit but tarot reading kind of led to psychosis, nothing bad happened but it can get intense if you don't stay grounded.

I recently bought some plants, they're either native or succulents so nothing high demand. Also, I am renting so not going to be doing a garden, might look at big pots though for fruits.",1,1762393748.0,CasualConversation,10,1.0,False

1opm2zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1opm2zd/i_had_to_cut_ties_with_my_mom/,I Had To Cut Ties With My Mom,"I (31 F) recently went to visit my mom in my home town (I live a 5 hour plane flight away) and it made me finally notice so many toxic behaviours that I never connected before. It was the final push I needed to leave the relationship. However, I feel like I’m drowning in guilt, depression, anxiety, and even regret I suppose. I’m sorry this is so long, I really don’t have many friends and I don’t want to start drama with my family so I’m just suffering mostly alone (I do have a partner that loves me a lot but that’s kind of it) 

I’m currently finishing my BA in Psychology. I’ve written an original paper that I’m presenting at a conference, and will be publishing. I’ve got a 3.95 GPA and I’m working on another paper with my professor - I’m going to be going into Clinical Psychology. I’m not trying brag I just want to point out how important this is to me to give a bit of context for my trip. My friend came with me because he’d never been to my home town and it’s a tourist spot. 

The first 2 days were fine, fun even. 

Day 3 it started going downhill in small ways (I asked my mom what my paper was about and she got it wrong using really specific words - I didn’t make a big deal. I corrected her, and used an example that was personal to her, thinking that would help her remember). 

Day 4, she started triangulation (telling stories about my little brother, but I was very firm that I didn’t want to talk about it), ignored my carved pumpkins (god it sounds so freaking stupid but I spend HOURS on them and she didn’t even take a picture… but she took pictures of everything else on Halloween), asked me to go inside when kids liked my costume better than hers, ignored/walked away from me when I asked if she wanted me to order pizza, and when I asked if anyone wanted to see the experiment I programmed from scratch my mom said ‘oh the one you mentioned where people get paid 7$?’ ‘Yeah!’ and then she just walked away without responding and went to watch tv. 

Day 5 I went to visit an estranged paternal aunt for a few hours and when I came home the energy was weird in the house. My stepbrother was visiting because I hadn’t been home in awhile. He has a band and I was trying to celebrate him (the way I wasn’t being celebrated) by playing his song on Spotify and singing along to show I knew the lyrics. I got exactly 57 seconds into his song when my mom whispers to my little brother and then turns to me with a subtle smile saying ‘WE figured out what’s wrong with you: you shake your head too much and all of your brain cells fell out and died.’ It hurt, sure, but I tried to downplay it and just said ‘well I’m going to be a Dr, so I can’t be that dumb’ and she goes ‘well we will have to see about that…’ and I still didn’t get upset. I just tried to move on, but everything I said she had a negative mean thing to say (I’ll have a shitty house, I’ll choose bad vacation spots, I won’t even be able to afford anything in the end). Finally she says something like ‘well we will go to Caribbean and you won’t be invited’ and my friend goes ‘if you can afford it at that point’ and my mom says ‘I don’t even understand how this got negative??’ I snapped. I shouldn’t have, and I know that but I did. I ask her what my paper was about and she says ‘you already told me’ ‘so what’s it about then?’ ‘Why does it matter?’ ‘Whats it about mom?’ And she uses the exact same wrong phrasing. I ask her if she even knows someone who has written a paper (the answer being no) but she won’t just say no, just why does it matter. Finally I say, ‘this is important to me… why don’t you care?’ And she’s got nothing, just sitting there with no emotion at all through the whole thing. My brother gets up and says he’s going home because people can’t get along or whatever and I go to my room to just bawl. (Apparently as he left he calmly explained to her that he wouldn’t be hanging around both of us anymore, but he wouldn’t come back to see me before I go). As sim as he leaves she goes into the living room and starts laughing and joking with the rest of the family. 

While I’m sitting in the room I’m staying in I look around the room and realize… it’s like a museum of misery and erasure. Pictures of dogs, my brother (not step siblings, just bio), even her dog’s kennel certificates - but not a single photo of me (she has some she just ‘didn’t get a chance to put them up’ in 6 months…). It’s got stuffed animals (1 I purchased but not a single one that I physically crocheted for her despite her demanding that I spend time making her one during her last visit to my house). It’s also an uncomfortable futon with a memory foam topper UNDER the mattress not on top, it’s got weird vents that connect directly to the kitchen and living room meaning any noise in the house came into this room (I got like maybe 4 hours of sleep each night I was there). The more I looked around the room, the more I started hysterically laughing because it was like perfectly designed to make me miserable, while still having enough to make me sound insane if I brought it up.

Day 6 my friend and I just needed out of the house and they wanted to get speciality paints from a store in a nearby town so I asked my little brother (the only person with a car besides my mom) if he would bring us. I apologized for the argument and upsetting him and promised not to talk about it (as long as he didn’t want too). My mom starts blowing up his phone the MOMENT we leave the drive way saying he’s ’taking my side.’ I kept my promise and didn’t bring up anything but eventually the text messages got to him. He opens up a bit about how he’s been feeling and I mention the things she said to me about him during the triangulation a few days ago (as close to verbatim as possible and verified by my friend who was there) and my brother is now pissed. Because she essentially said that he was financially ruining her… but he gave her 3000$. We end up talking more and ‘comparing notes’ I suppose and I notice these patterns going back years, decades. I still try to be kind and bring her home special doughnuts she *loves*. It’s 8pm when I get home and she’s in her room, so I knock on the door and try to explain I brought her a treat home… ignored. The dog starts whining and scratching at the door… ignored. I try knocking again… ignored. 10 minutes later she lets the dog out because it won’t stop whining. 10 minutes after that she comes out for 30 seconds, walks into the living room, and then heads back to her room. I tell her about the doughnut and in the flattest tone ever ‘oh, thanks’ and then gone for the rest of the night.

I decide to ask my dad for coffee (he was working until about midnight) so we can chat about everything and I wanted to know if he saw these patterns. My dad has ASPD (psychopathy) believe me or don’t, this is my ridiculous life, but he’s ALWAYS been blunt with me about his internal thoughts and ‘feelings’ (example: ‘you shouldn’t empathize with people, empathy is for the weak’ - okay dad…) So I figured if I asked him, he’d be honest too, and he was… sort of… he did say that my mom was ‘the perfect mother’ until I was about 6 or so. And that he ‘never loved her’ but he wanted kids so he married the first woman who would give him kids (okay dad…). However, he ALSO points out she wanted two kids but it didn’t matter which two kids, just that we (my brother and I) existed - something my brother and I have always felt and have said to each other in the past. Maybe he picked up on what we wanted to hear, I don’t know 🤷‍♀️. I do want to mention, she actually had affairs (multiple) throughout their marriage (he had one). She walked away from the marriage with every asset, and he walked away with every bill. The more I think about it, the more I feel like maybe SHE was always the dominant predator??

Day 7 I wake up with a brutal migraine (probably from stress) and I barely make it to the bathroom before vomiting in the sink. My mom comes downstairs to ‘check on me’… by asking how late I was out, if I ate anything (I said I didn’t eat anything TWICE) before ending the conversation with ‘do you always overindulge like this?’ - I’m on the floor, barely able to move, and in EXCRUCIATING pain… she didn’t even bring me a water or ask if I needed medication… but do I always overindulge like this? I avoid her the rest of the day and go out for dinner with my dad.

Day 8 I’m finally leaving to go home and I wake up an hour before we need to leave and my mom’s still in her room (she’s not coming to bring me to the airport… is the first thing I think), but I start getting ready. I wake up my friend, we are waiting to go and it’s 15 minutes until leaving and my mom’s still not out of her room. 5 minutes to go and she exits in her PJs still ‘my dog is really sick, I’m worried so I’m going to stay home’ she says. ‘The dog hasn’t pooped yet.’ 😂 okay mom. My step dad drives us to their airport and when we touchdown at home I send her an empathetic message saying I can’t have her in my life anymore. There is no nice way to say it, but I did my damn best to tell her I love her, we just can’t keep doing this. And I blocked her. Not 5 mins later I get a text from my step dad calling me a coward, telling me I’m just like my dad. So I blocked him too without responding. I gave my brother a heads up and said ‘I just wanted to let you know I said goodbye to mom. You can read my message if you want, but I don’t want you in the middle of anything’.

And I thought I’d feel relief, or something positive? But I don’t. I feel better than if I didn’t do it, but I don’t feel good…

If you made it this far, thank you. I’m sorry it was so long. So far this has only been the last week but realistically so much more has happened. If you want to keep reading:

1. I made her a crocheted scarf when she came to visit (and I’m good at it, not that it matters a lot, but they take me HOURS and I constantly get requests to make things) and not even a week later after she gets home I get a message from maternal grandmother ‘thanking me for the beautiful scarf’. When I asked my mom if she gave it away because she didn’t like something about it she didn’t give me a straight answer and just said ‘lol’

2. I specifically asked for NOT a tv. I don’t want a tv, I need to move for school soon and TVs break, I’m fairly blind and projectors work better, and I legitimately don’t have a place for a tv - guess what I got for my birthday? When I talked to my brother about it long story shorter she had said ‘your sister hated our last present and BEGGED me for a tv.’ Why buy an expensive present I didn’t want? Because she wanted a TV for when she visits ONCE A YEAR.

3. I searched ‘sorry’ ‘proud’ and ‘good job’ in our chat history and never once in 15 years of messages did she say these things to me. She’s never posted about my accomplishments on Facebook but she posts CONSTANT pictures of her dogs. And when I won a prestigious scholarship she said… ‘congratulations’ that’s it, and didn’t ask me about it on the phone either just ‘yeah I saw it on Facebook.’

4. She invited herself to play video games with my brother and I. Despite 200+ hours, plus spending money on her in the game, etc etc she will still say my brother doesn’t do anything for her and never helps her. When I play with her she’s so mean to me that I end up in tears every time. I tried to play high (to cope honestly, weed is legal here) and she wouldn’t stop bothering me. So I didn’t do weed again (but she kept bothering me STILL - even after I said NUMEROUS times I didn’t have weed) 

5. I saved the most horrific for this last comment, I have so much more (56 tbh, my clinical brain would not stop) but I think it’s enough? I don’t know? Anyhow…

My step dad was sober, had two kids, and an 11 year marriage when they had an affair. Since then she has bullied him into drinking ‘you’re not a real man if you can’t drink’, buying him alcohol, and just being all around cruel. He lost his job, and now works 3 jobs to fund her vacations (that he doesn’t get to go on btw). She had him drain his retirement to buy a trailer that their car can’t even tow… while hers stays completely untouched. She’s isolated him from his kids, friends, and he’s basically just a shell of a person at this point. Day 6 of my trip was his birthday - can you guess what they did to celebrate? If it’s ’nothing’ you are correct! 


So… why the fuck do I feel so bad and guilty and shitty? And honestly, if you want to tell me this is AI, or I’m making it up or ANYTHING except something that’s kind or helpful - please don’t. I don’t need it right now. I know my mom is going to tell every family member I have left what a shitty person I am, and how I’m cruel and mean… and I just don’t need more right now. I’m a real person, and my situation is horribly real… I just want to know I’m not alone? ",1,1762393654.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Proud owner of a number of cozy sweaters (aka free human furnace), minor Coke Zero addict and a bit of lingering abandonment issues (working on it), major pizza fanatic - hoping to find a smart, funny, child free (obv), physically active partner who wants to live our DINKY life, have company for her dog walks and I dunno… nonchalantly fall for each other I guess. As an added bonus, we can finally become real adults and be each others emergency contacts.

Always down for some fun travel adventures (India, Greece, Jamaica plus a bunch of US spots for work so far this year), enjoying coffee throughout the city, BBQing my heart out, petting any dogs that make eye contact and helping the local economy by hitting patios when the mood strikes.

Physically I’m 5’11, 205, shaved head and a thick black beard (now featuring white strands!) and live in downtown Toronto. Ideally looking for someone local within the downtown area as one of my love languages is quality time and through past relationships, I’ve learned how much i appreciate spending time with my partner.

1oplyuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oplyuz/my_25f_boyfriend_23m_used_to_coerce_me_into_it/,"My (25F) boyfriend (23M) used to coerce me into it. Years later, my body still rejects him.","We got together pretty young, back in 2019. It’s been six years now. I was 19 and he was 17. I was a virgin and he wasn’t.



During the pandemic, my dad got very sick. He had cancer and later developed a brain disease. He spent months in the hospital, in the ICU. When he finally came home, he was bedridden and not fully lucid. Later, he got pneumonia and was close to dying. I was completely devastated. My dad was my best friend... I was daddy’s little girl.



Seeing him sick and later losing him was the hardest thing I’ve ever faced.



At that time, I was studying hard to get into law school and emotionally falling apart. My sex drive was low (not gone, just... low). One day, while I was sad and talking to my boyfriend about how scared I was that my dad would die, he started groping me, trying to initiate sex. Literally as I said, “I’m afraid my dad will pass soon.”



He was 17, so I told myself it was immaturity, hormones, lack of awareness. But that kind of behavior had already been a pattern. He would often try to “get me in the mood” after I’d said no... asking to touch me, to undress, to do things to me even when I said I wasn’t up for it. I often gave in because I didn’t want him to feel rejected or undesired. I thought that was what a good girlfriend was supposed to do.



The last straw was that day when I was grieving and he still tried to get off. I told him I was done. I even told him I almost fell in love with another person who used to be there for me., at the time. Said that I was falling out of love, that what he was doing made me feel coerced and violated.



He forgave me for emotionally cheating and I forgave him for the above.



To his credit, he stopped immediately and has somewhat respected my boundaries ever since. He almost never initiates sex and I do just because when I don't, I feel bad about it. It’s been four years, and he’s never crossed that line again. He uses to make little comments to see if I'm open to it or not.



But something inside me is still broken, even after all that time.



Ever since, I’ve never truly felt physical desire for him again. I'm almost repulsed, even. I fake it. The arousal, the orgasms, the interest. I say I need lube because of birth control, but the truth is, I just don’t get wet. I don’t want to be touched. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve become asexual.



Outside of that, we’ve grown apart too. I’ve become an adult. I graduated, became a lawyer, I work, pay bills, run errands, handle responsibilities. Meanwhile, he still lives like a teenager. He’s in an IT program, plays video games all day, and does his homework. That’s it. He doesn’t drive, doesn’t take public transportation, doesn’t cook, doesn’t clean his room, and has literally never been grocery shopping in his life. His mom takes him everywhere.



When I imagine living with him, I don’t feel excited . I feel anxious. The thought of sharing a life or a home with him feels exhausting. I know I’d end up carrying everything - emotionally, financially, practically - and I already feel drained just thinking about it.



So why do I stay?



I figured a miserable sex life was the price to pay for having a somewhat great partner, on the other areas?



I mean, he’s not a bad person. He’s caring, patient, gentle, affectionate, calm, is always there for me when I need him to. He’s loyal, and he genuinely tries to please me in bed (I promise, trust my word on that, so I don't have to get into too much details, TMI), even though I have to fake it. He’s calm and never pressures me anymore. He learnt how to cook rice, pasta and make coffee for me. He tries to make me feel loved by my love language (acts of service). I know he loves me and I do care about him... but it feels like brotherly affection, not romantic love.



I love hanging out with him for a short amount of time. Not the entire weekend.



I’ve realized I’m staying mostly out of guilt and fear: guilt for hurting him, fear of regretting it, fear of being alone. I keep hoping he’ll change, grow up, become independent… but when he takes small steps in that direction, I just feel nothing. Not pride, not attraction... just impatience.



I think I’ve already emotionally left the relationship, but my body and mind haven’t caught up yet. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to marry him out of habit and spend the rest of my life pretending to want sex or affection. I don’t think this is how love should feel, even after years together.



I''m currently on therapy



TL;DR: About 4 years ago, my boyfriend would low-key coerce me into being intimate by groping me and asking me to strip even after I said I wasn't on the mood. I used to give in, but the last straw was when he did dad literally as I was talking about how afraid I was about my sick dad passing away. I talked to him about it and he hasn't done it ever since, but I still feel repulsed and obligated every single time... I just want it to end as soon as we start being intimate.

1oplwnf,https://i.redd.it/we2zq9zpjjzf1.jpeg,"So much kindness here, for both me and my 13 yo boy.","Just got back from the vet, things went smoothly and Ira passed as peacefully as can be. He was purring in my arms until the end, and I hope I don’t lose the feeling of his fur against my cheek for a long time to come. I’m going to miss those mornings where I wake up to find him snuggling on the pillow next to me, waiting to walk me to the restroom, then meowing as I made coffee and made his breakfast. His brothers, as much as I love them, are cats; Ira was a completely other thing, and his soul was always there for comfort or conversation. When people describe their cat as “one of a kind”, I get it: Ira was all that and then some. He will be very missed.

I can’t say enough to those who reached out with kind words, thoughtfulness, and even a suggestion or two about how to prolong his life; I’m reminded of a time, fifteen-some years ago, when social media was seen as a way for complete strangers to reach across the void and connect with each other as a way to share knowledge, or express concern. It was so very human then; and it’s obviously not disappeared completely. Thank you, all of you. You made me feel better about losing him, you really did.

In the vibrant, saffron-and-green-hued tapestry of India, where the cacophony of democracy thrives and a kaleidoscope of diversity abounds, a grey, insidious shadow looms large—the shadow of freeloading. From the neon-lit, exhaust-choked streets of Delhi, ringing with the ceaseless blare of horns, to the quiet, sun-drenched villages of Punjab, fragrant with the scent of mustard fields, from the air-conditioned, hushed corporate boardrooms of Mumbai, smelling faintly of imported coffee and ambition, to the dusty, sun-baked farmlands of Haryana, echoing with the distant hum of tubewells, freeloaders exploit the system.

1oplqnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oplqnb/my_26f_husband_40m_insults_the_homelesspoor/,My 26f husband 40m insults the homeless/poor knowing that used to be me? He says I’m overthinking it completely,"We have been together 3 years now. We come from 2 different worlds but for the most part we’re a good match, and we fun together.

He says the comments don’t “apply to me” but.. I think they do.

First off just to explain how poor I was growing up. My mom was terminally ill pretty much my entire life, after she passed my dad stopped talking to me/my brother.

At 16 I moved into my car, after years of on and off homelessness and crappy jobs I started working as a waitress at a pretty nice restaurant and was able to rent a crappy room. This to me was absolute luxury, having my own room lol.


I met him at like midnight walking home from work. He saw me and was concerned about me, wanted to help me. So I gave in and let him drive me home. I ended up agreeing to go out with him but I was in a lot of debt, and obviously struggling.

He was not judgemental at all, he helped me get out of it. I moved into his home, we obviously ended up engaged. He is truly an amazing guy but I don’t understand how he differentiates me from others in the same scenario.

We have a good life now, I’m a housewife which for someone like me after years of chaos is extremely peaceful and amazing, he works in law. We’re planing on having a baby soon..
So this isn’t something I want to leave him over, it’s more that I’m looking for help on how to better communicate with him.

He knows Everything and he knows I was homeless, but he’ll say things about homeless people being “dirty” or needing to “get off their ass and work” right in front of me.

But he literally was the one that pulled me out of that, I could have very well (and probably would have) ended up back in that situation.

I asked him what is different about me, and the homeless man he was talking about and he laughed and said “it wasn’t even comparable” so no real explanation.


We were laying in bed the other night and talking about the cost of living in our area and he made a joke he liked it and hoped it continued to go up because he doesn’t want the people who can’t afford it in his neighborhood.. and I was just like… okay but that is me.

And he says it’s not, because it’s not anymore but he’s basically saying in my mind that if I were single & still in a bad situation I’m right there with the people he’s insulting.


There was also another time, we were shopping on rodeo drive and some guy was asking me for money for coffee, I was trying to find my wallet and he pulled me away. He did actually give this guy money but he was pissed I was talking to him, said if he wants money he can get a job and also said it’s dangerous for me to talk to them.
But as someone who lived it i know most of these people are good people. I understand using caution but genuinely most are good.

He literally let me in his car the first night we met, he thought i was homeless and wasn’t scared of me

He says I’m thinking way too much, and it has nothing to do with me. But i just can’t help but think… what did you truly think of me when we met?

You weren’t the same after that shift.
Ever since the whispering cell incident, clocks felt... off. Time moved like it was limping. Coffee didn’t taste like coffee anymore it tasted like static and regret. And Jenkins? Still snoring like a lawnmower in a wind tunnel. But now, every so often, he'd mutter words in his sleep like ""reversal"" or ""it’s almost your turn.""
Cute.
So naturally, like any mentally stable corrections officer who is definitely not having a prolonged psychic breakdown, you decided to go back to Cell 43 on your next shift. You told yourself it was for “routine inspection,” which is code for “I need answers but I’m too proud to say I’m scared.”
You approached the door. Still empty. Still humming that barely-audible sound, like someone tuning an old radio in another dimension. You stepped inside, because you’ve clearly stopped valuing personal safety.
Then it happened.
The door slammed shut behind you.
Pitch black.
You reached for your flashlight, gone. Radio, dead. Heart rate, Olympic sprinter. And then, from the corner of the cell, a voice, not a whisper this time, but your own voice, perfectly mimicked spoke.
“You already left. Why are you still here?”
A flicker of light. The cement wall now held a mirror. But the reflection wasn’t you. It was a version of you with gray skin, tired eyes, and a name tag that said, “Warden – 2097”.
Then he smiled. Not the kind of smile you trust. The kind that says, ""You’re on your way to becoming me.""
The mirror cracked. Your radio suddenly chirped:
“Control to Unit 4, cell check overdue. Where are you?”
You blinked.
Back in your chair again.
Clock: 15 minutes to go.
But your badge? It now read:
“Warden (Provisional)”

I hear that most positions (foreign associates) get secured as a result of previous bestfriends relationships between foreign and US firms.

Despite having several years of prior experience as M&A lawyer in Europe, I’m struggling to understand how LL.M.s can realistically position themselves for associate roles in any Big Law.

Any practical tips worth considering at this stage? Any firms you know to be more open to hiring LL.M.s, or tending to be more approachable for info chats?

1opllph,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1opllph/i_refuse_to_do_christmas_with_my_family_because/,I refuse to do Christmas with my family because of my sister.,"So I found out today that my mom is coming from out of state to visit for Christmas. Yay right that’s what I thought too. Well my family sadly has one of those group chats where we try to pretend to be a normal family. (It doesn’t start dinging until mom comes). This group chat consist of my SIL, brother, sister, grandmother, and mom.  Well brother messages the group chat trying to figure out what to put together. Fair enough right. I say I’ll bake something (because I’m the baker of the family beside grandmother) but remind my brother not to cook the turkey upside down again. (my brother and I have this kind of relationship) well my sister messaged something (she has me blocked so I didn’t see it directly get to the why later) but brother laughed reacted to it and that’s how I seen exactly what was said and it was about “I vote cook turkey upside down to piss *my name* off”. Cool one would think she was teasing the younger sister but here lies that issues
1.) she has me blocked so she said it thinking I wouldn’t even see it.
2.) she never talks to me just about me.
3.) she always makes rude remarks like that and worse about me and only me.
4.) if I fight back everyone gets mad at me and expects me to just get over it. 
So for some context my sister and I are 7 years apart. My mom was young and dumb and wasn’t the best mom when she had my older siblings my grandmother helped with them along with other family members who I don’t know that well. Well then I came along and mom got her act together for lack of better terms (she was never a bad mom just young and learning) and was completely there for me I was her baby. She dated one guy before step dad aka just dad for me. But out side of that it was the four of us my mom sibling and I. Well sister had jealousy towards me because I “got the better mom” from then on. Not to mention she had trauma like the rest of us but from a younger age (not my story won’t even touch on it more) well growing up I freaking idiolized my sister. She was the coolest thing sense sliced bread. Well I reached teen years and my eyes opened up to her a little bit you could tell she had some issues. She had her first child and ppd kicked in and during the first year of that kids life she had to move back in with her baby daddy and child no big issue yay a baby and I love being an aunt. But then I was cleaning up after her her baby daddy and kid plus me my dad and mom (she was sick and couldn’t clean all the time) I was a teen I already hated my chores but she never helped around the house and I would get yelled at to do it all and that I should be grateful to do it because mom brought me into this world and everyone else works…. Okay cool that lasted 6-8 months sister and boyfriend get a place thank God right…well no because sister needed help at her house or needed a free babysitter and my parents would force me to go do whatever she needed. Her house in a month was so bad that it took me an month to catch up her laundry clean maggots out of her dishes (only thing clean was coffee pot and one cup) cook dinner for her and her baby daddy who did help when he could it he worked almost 24/7 as a tow truck driver. While she worked 30-40 hours a week with a FREE LIVE IN NANNY basically and did nothing literally nothing wouldn’t even shower. Now yes she was pregnant again and lied about it until a month before the kid was born but come on pregnancy doesn’t equal unable. Well that went on for a whole summer and thank goodness for school because it was the only break I got from her for years. Well she ends up marrying and divorcing first baby daddy I actually grew to like him as a person little he was still flawed and could’ve helped with his kids more but as a person not horrible. She gets with another one and gets pregnant for a third time and married again I didn’t like this guy he made me hate doing anything for my sister because of how uncomfortable he made me and my family. She got so depressed her house keeping got worse and she he made her take care of all their kids by herself so rightfully so she got depressed. I ended up having my first kid six months after her third and last kid but then I got married (bad me trust me) I went through the ringer there but still whenever my sister needed a baby sitter (not free anymore) she called me until things got really bad and I would tell her no. During all of this though she would always say something snippy and rude and try to monopolize on my moms time. I mean she always had my mom’s attention because she never let our mom forget how she wasn’t there for her as much when she was younger 🙃 so because of that I had to have my dad and sisters help with my first period first heartbreak ect. I’m also the only child they never seen graduate in person I had to make it a Facebook live just so my mom and dad could watch me graduate. Then if I was around her and my mom she would always talk about how I didn’t have friends or anything in school (maybe it’s because I had to be free to watch her kids at the drop of the dime for her to do something with our mom) and it’s always caughed up to be her “teasing”. Well last year our big blow out that completely blew up any chance of a sisterly relationship was ruined. I called about some 50 shades of gray books making sure her kids didn’t get ahold of them because if they did it would have been MY FAULT let me clearly say that. Well like I said she is messed up and had just gotten off the phone with one of her ex husbands about the kids. She thought I was questioning her parenting…no just no never judge any parent if they are trying they are a good parent the only way to be a bad parent is not to try for your kids at all. My sister does she is a good mom just strict on some things. Her thinking I attack her parenting attacked mine by saying I abandon my kids (long story but I didn’t) I called a few very cruel words for lady of the night. She is/was poly and it was a jab at that because I don’t agree with that especially the way she did it. So now I’m blocked and have been i have been told to apologize and I said I would when she does first because I always apologize first like when I punched her first getting in my face and she gets away without apologizing. I mean my sister literally has never apologized to me. So her remark in the “family” group chat is my breaking point I mentally can’t keep doing it and being expected to stay quiet or if I speak up I’m the disrespectful one and “need to respect boundaries” so I said I’m not going. Am I the asshole for not going even though my mom is coming from out of state.",6,1762392319.0,okstorytime,3,1.0,False

1opli7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1opli7o/chaos_chosen_chapter_1_congratulations/,[Chao's Chosen] Chapter 1 Congratulations!,"“Congratulations on the promotion.” 



“Thank you,” Leo said. His chest had been puffed out all day. After years of congratulating others, he’d finally earned his huge promotion. He’d shaken at least thirty hands already. It never got old. 

Holmes walked up to him. Instead of a handshake, the pair dapped each other. “Can’t believe they’re letting a bum like you be Lead Portfolio Manager. You give me hope for my future.”



“Thank you,” Leo said. “I’m glad you’ve decided to take inspiration instead of hating like someone.” His gaze drifted to a distant corner of the office, where a tall man was chugging water like tequila. 

Holmes traced his gaze. “Damn. Marcus looks like someone just ran his puppy over.”



“I know, right? It’s terrible.” It was amazing. After months of hearing the hotshot twenty year old brag about his connections, model girlfriend, and wealthy parents, Marcus was due for a loss. Mr. Model Girlfriend could go cry in his BMW after work, meanwhile single Leo escaped to his beat-up 1992 Corolla at day’s end. Seeing the man Marcus least respected, Leo himself, promote must have been a gut-punch. Leo slurped his disgusting coffee, imagining all the future body blows he could deliver. 

“Marcus thought he would waltz out of college straight to being the big boss. He’s just reeling a bit right now. He’ll be fine.”



“Don’t enjoy it too much. The kid was born connected and he has a mean streak.”

“I’ve been told, by him, a thousand times.”



Holmes laughed and patted him on the back. The pair broke apart with a laugh, Holmes to harass an attractive co-worker, Leo to visit his attractive new office.



The window alone felt luxurious after years in a cubicle farm. It almost filled the entirety of the wall, displaying the Statue of Liberty in the distant backdrop. When Leo walked up to it, he could see the tops of several buildings and the pedestrians scurrying around like ants. He waved as a pair of window cleaners cleaned, then ascended upwards a floor. Then he leaned back onto his desk and sighed. It’d taken years of phony interviews, lies, and humiliating brown-nosing, but he’d reached a new peak.



And nothing can bring me down from this.



A chime rang in his head like a bell. Words filled his vision letter by letter as he stood there, fighting the urge to pound his chest and howl in victory. He didn’t process any of it until a voice spoke in his head.



**The System has identified the species \[human\] as the most intelligent life-form on the planet. Greetings Humans, the Planet \[Earth\] has been selected for integration into the greater multiverse. The Human species will have sixty-seven earth seconds to accept or decline this integration.**



**You have received a New Quest: Vote for System Integration.**



Two amber letters filled Leo’s head. Yes and No. The number 66 appeared under it, ticking with each passing second.



He rose from his desk, heart pounding. He’d just climbed to a new peak, and feared it might have cost him his sanity. Leaving his new office, he found a cubicle farm filled with silence. It seemed like everyone had paused where they stood or sat. A couple faces snapped his way, their eyes searching for something.



The hell they want from me. Then Leo remembered his new position. He straightened his posture and added some bass to his voice. “Just say no.” He shrugged and looked around like it was no big deal. “Let’s all say no as a group, together, and this will all blow by.”

 

Twenty seconds remaining.



Leo hoped that would be the end of it. He refused to let all his hard work be for nought. With every fiber of his being he refused whatever was happening. The word ‘no’ in his vision blinked three times, then disappeared. Leo tilted his head. Can it read my thoughts?

Another chime in his head. 



**You have completed Quest: Vote for System Integration.**



Leo stood silently amongst his co-workers as the countdown reached zero. The voice returned.



**Thank you for your input. The results will now be displayed.**

**Humanity's Vote for Integration: 52% For, 48% against.**



Congratulations Planet \[Earth\] on your promotion. Welcome to the Multiverse. Earthlings are encouraged to participate in a thirty day tutorial to maximize post-integration survival. Green-marked zones will appear throughout the planet. When the five minute timer concludes, you must be within one of those zones to enter the tutorial. Warning: While the tutorial is dangerous in its own right, forgoing it will almost certainly result in death.



Once the voice stopped speaking, dozens of green arrows entered Leo’s vision, alongside a timer that ticked down from five minutes. The entire office stood in stillness, then motion erupted all at once. Rebecca from HR hopped over a table, breaking for the outside hallway, yelping as Marcus shoved her to the ground and rushed out first. The tall man kicked another co-worker out of his way as he turned the corner. A swarm of co-workers tried to follow suit, but got tangled amongst each other, forming a bottleneck at the doorway.



It played out in Leo’s eyes like a slow motion horror scene. He turned toward the second exit, also bottlenecked. A motion near his hips caught his attention. It was Annah rolling over in her wheelchair with tears in her eyes. Leo could tell she’d reached the same conclusion he had.



They were fucked. He patted her shoulder to calm her as he racked his brain thinking of a comforting lie. That whole bit about missing the tutorial leading to death was all a joke. Just thinking was draining him. Movement caught the corner of his eye. It was those window cleaners, making a hasty descent. Leo rushed into his office, then looked back at Annah. 



It would be smartest to go Marcus’s route. Every man and woman for themselves. He clicked his tongue and went back to grab Annah from her wheelchair.



Since when did he aspire to be like that asshole?



Thankfully, Annah was light, given her petite frame. She looked at him with wide eyes, about to protest, but Leo hissed at her. “Shhh.” Everyone was too busy to notice them anyway. Good, because they couldn’t all fit. 



Scrambling into his office, he opened the window and poked his head out. “Hey, come back up here and pick us up,” he yelled to the descending window cleaners, turning his head to ensure no one else heard.



The window cleaners looked at each other, then up at him. “No time,” one of them said. 

“Make time or I’ll scream for the whole office to jump on with you. That thing can’t hold fifty people, can it? I think it’ll be a real quick drop if we tried.”



At least five expressions twisted across the window cleaner’s face, but he clicked a button that stopped the descent, then another that got the platform rising again.”



Leo waited until it reached a leapable distance away, then jumped for it. His heart sank at the platform bobbed, but it settled itself. “Down,” he said for no reason. The window cleaner already had them descending again. Leo checked the timer that had shrunk into the corner of his vision. They had two minutes.



They hit the ground with only a minute to spare. The trio of men sprinted toward the closest arrow with Leo carrying Annah along. Though petite, she started to feel like an anvil with each step. 

Leo considered dropping her somewhere to secure his own safety. It was only a passing thought, but it still shamed him They reached one of the green-zones. There were about twenty people inside, the two cleaners joined the group first, then came Leo and Annah. As they walked in, the zone turned red.



As Leo turned in confusion, someone spoke up from the pack. “Each of these zones has a person limit, pretty fucked up right? Look up.” 



Leo glanced up and saw a number floating above the zone: 23/22. Meaning they were one person over. Leo felt dizzy. He started stepping away from the zone when one of the cleaners grabbed him by the arm.



“Hey, just drop the lady off to the side and come in with us.”



“What?” Annah yelled.



“The voice said there’s danger in the tutorial. She’ll only hold us back. I’d rather have you there with us.” A couple of people voiced their agreement in the back.



Annah started gasping. “I swear if you dump me aside I’ll just crawl back in. Then none of us will—“

“Everyone shut the fuck up,” Leo said.  He thrust Annah into the cleaner’s arms. “You’re going to take her.” Then he ran away before he could change his mind, feeling like his entire body was covered in slime. He’d been a hair’s width away from doing exactly what the cleaner said to spare himself. 



Arms pumping, he searched for another zone to enter. He found a couple, but they were all fully occupied. As he ran, he saw a tall man waving at him. He turned to see Marcus standing on the edge of a green-zone, the number above it read: 16/17.



Leo didn’t bother checking the countdown as it’d only demoralize him. Right now he needed to focus on getting his burning quads to sprint faster. It’d been half a decade (generously) since he last sprinted. Those eleven hour days he’d worked to earn his promotion were coming back to bite him.

It felt like stone pillars had replaced his legs, each step coming half as fast yet with twice the painful cost. His stride degraded to a waddle as the green-colored zone neared. It was a leap away. The Question: was it a Leo leap away?



He had to risk it. Gathering the remnants of his energy he crouched into a squat then bounced toward the safety zone in a rather pitiful leap, heart thrashing, fearing it wouldn’t be enough. Those fears were unmerited. He would have landed the jump comfortably. 



Would have…



If Marcus hadn’t extended his leg and drove his dress-shoes deep into Leo’s belly. Leo spewed spit as his momentum stalled, then reversed. The ground eagerly greeted his right shoulder, its welcome popped his shoulder joint and chafed the skin on his cheek. White light burst into his vision as Leo rolled in agony. His hearing turned to static. 



Fragments of a voice cut through the buzz. A stupid sounding voice. “… right… I never…” Leo gritted his teeth as he struggled to his hands and knees. His left knee clicked with each movement. “… congratulated… ” Chills danced down his spine as he failed to stand up. He forced himself to crawl toward the safety zone, ignoring his instincts to check the timer.



**Zero seconds remaining.**



He stilled as a now-familiar voice echoed in his head. 



**You have failed (Optional) Quest: Teleport to the Tutorial**



**Countdown Complete. Tutorial Teleportation Commencing.**



Leo looked up in shock. Marcus greeted him with a wave and that smug grin he wore like an accessory. “Congratulations on your promotion. Leo. You deserve everything you’ve got coming to you.”



Seeing that stupid face brought burning clarity to Leo. It filled his lungs with a second wind. Ignoring his popping knee he sprinted toward the now yellow zone, arm cocked and ready to unleash his best punch. He swung awkwardly at the spot Marcus had just been, stumbling through the air like a drunk. Turning, he looked around. All the safety zones had disappeared.



**Congratulations to the humans of \[Planet Earth\] who decided to forgo the tutorial. \[Planet Earth\] will now be combined with \[Planet Terra\]. Please stand by while the integration commences.** 



Leo slumped to his knees. The ground around him shook violently. A few of the buildings and trees began to uproot from the ground as the sounds of howling winds surrounded him. But Leo hardly noticed any of it. He’d broken into a laugh, slow at first, that consumed his entire body. Tears filled his eyes as he hacked up giggles. He didn’t  notice his body lift off the ground, floating to join a growing mass of dislodged buildings and earth. 



He didn’t notice the black clouds congregating, spewing their red and purple lightning all over the world. 



He did notice a sudden shock against his back. Amongst the purple and red lightning bolts, a solitary green bolt struck him with pinpoint accuracy, stopping his laughter and beating heart in one go.

Leo closed his heavy lids as he drifted into the darkness. A barrage of notifications chimed in his head.

I didn’t buy it because sometimes I have sensitivity to fragrance, as explained in this post. I found that I didn’t have issues while wearing it, but still haven’t made a purchase. Since then, I’ve been curious to find anything with a similar profile. At some point I would like to sample it, but the sample set (two perfume oils of choice at 2ml) is $13 and shipping is $11.90, so I’m not sure yet…

Recently I came across Corpse Water from Kheimistrii, which sounds similar. Here is the description from their site:

“The darkest amber, nutmeg, absinthe-infused dark rum, cyanide essence, tonka bean, hemoglobin, saffron tobacco, the mortician's mocha espresso with sugar, sandalwood, vetiver and green pepper. This is not a 'coffee' or 'chocolate' scent. The mocha and dark coffee blends seamlessly with the other notes for the presentation of a wearable masterpiece. It is a bit on the masculine side, but not in a heavy musky, cologne-like way. It's softer.”

As a professional travel writer, I can tell you that five days is the sweet spot. It’s long enough to fall in love with the city's magic but not so long that you feel pressured to see everything at a breakneck pace. It's the perfect amount of time to experience the iconic landmarks and still have moments to wander, get lost, and feel like a true Parisian.

Let's break down exactly why five days in Paris is not just enough—it's ideal.

## Why 5 Days is the Sweet Spot for Paris

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **It Tackles FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):** In five days, you can comfortably hit all the major icons—the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame (exterior), Montmartre—without feeling completely rushed.
*   **It Allows for Spontaneity:** Unlike a whirlwind 3-day trip, a 5-day itinerary gives you breathing room. You can stumble upon a charming market, linger at a sidewalk café, or re-visit a neighborhood you loved.
*   **It Balances Iconic and Intimate:** You’ll get your fill of world-class museums and monuments, but you’ll also have the time to explore the city’s charming backstreets and local neighborhoods, or *arrondissements*.
*   **It's Manageable on a Budget:** A shorter trip means fewer nights in a hotel and fewer meals out, making this incredible city more accessible.

](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Morning (Eiffel Tower):** Start here. **Pro-tip: Book your tickets online weeks, or even months, in advance to avoid soul-crushing queues.** Take the elevator to the top for breathtaking views.
*   **Lunch (Champ de Mars):** Grab a sandwich, find a spot on the grass in the park below the tower, and just soak it all in.
*   **Afternoon (Seine River Cruise & Invalides):** A one-hour Bateaux Mouches cruise is a fantastic way to see many of Paris's landmarks from a unique perspective. Afterwards, walk over to Les Invalides to see Napoleon's tomb and its stunning golden dome.
*   **Evening (Champs-Élysées & Arc de Triomphe):** Stroll down the famous avenue to the Arc de Triomphe. Climb to the top for another incredible view, this time looking down the 12 avenues that radiate from it.

Today is all about embracing the artistic soul and regal history of Paris.

*   **Morning (The Louvre):** You can't miss it. **Again, book your tickets online!** Don't try to see everything. Pick your top three: the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. That’s a win.
*   **Lunch (Tuileries Garden):** Exit the Louvre into the beautiful Tuileries Garden. Grab a crepe from a street vendor and find a chair by the fountain.
*   **Afternoon (Musée d'Orsay or Shopping):** Cross the river to the Musée d'Orsay, housed in a former train station, to see incredible Impressionist works by Monet, Manet, and Degas. If art isn't your thing, this is a perfect time for shopping in the Saint-Honoré fashion district.
*   **Evening (Palais Garnier - Opera House):** Even if you don't see a show, taking a tour of this opulent building is like stepping into a fairytale.

*   **Afternoon (Dali Museum & Windmills):** Visit the Salvador Dalí Museum for a surreal experience, then hunt down the famous Moulin Rouge and other historic windmills in the area.

*   **Morning (Notre Dame & Sainte-Chapelle):** See the resilience of **Notre Dame Cathedral** (viewing the exterior is still a powerful experience) and then be amazed by the stunning stained-glass windows of **Sainte-Chapelle**. Go on a sunny morning for the full effect.
*   **Lunch (Latin Quarter):** Cross the bridge to the Latin Quarter. This area is bustling with students and filled with affordable eateries.
*   **Afternoon (Shakespeare and Company & Panthéon):** Visit the legendary English-language bookstore, Shakespeare and Company. Then, head to the Panthéon to see the crypts where Voltaire, Rousseau, and Marie Curie are buried.
*   **Evening (St. Germain-des-Prés):** Wander through the chic St. Germain neighborhood, home to famous cafés like Les Deux Magots and Café de Flore, historic haunts of Hemingway and Sartre. Enjoy a classic _café crème_.

## Pro Tips for Making Your 5-Day Trip Even Better

*   **Getting Around:** Buy a **Carnet** of 10 metro tickets or a **Navigo Decouverte** weekly pass (if your trip runs Monday-Sunday). The Paris Metro is incredibly efficient.
*   **Where to Stay:** For first-timers, staying in a central *arrondissement* like the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th will save you a lot of travel time.
*   **Food & Drink:** Don't eat at tourist-trap restaurants near major attractions. Wander a few streets away to find where the locals eat. And never underestimate the power of a fresh-baked baguette, some cheese, and a bottle of wine for a picnic.
*   **Saving Money:** Many museums offer free entry for EU residents under 26 (or just under 26 for all nationalities on the first Sunday of each month from Oct-March). Always check online.
