I (19M) had an interest in a woman (23F) in the same course as me. For two months, we were in the same assigned study group. As the group was dissolving, I thought I'd see if there was a spark. My thinking was that if not, I'd at least make a good friend, so I invited her for coffee over text. I didn't intend for it to be a date, more of a quick, low-stakes hangout. She agreed but said she was going on holiday and would let me know when she was back. I told her I was looking forward to seeing her and that we could organise it afterwards.

She never got back to me after the week-long break. The morning our course started again, she just reacted to my original message with a thumbs-up, and that was it. I immediately knew she wasn't interested, so I didn't mention it again. I still see her around in some classes and we exchange small talk;  I definitely didn't want things to be awkward. I was confused and would be lying if I said I was not hurt a bit. Why she initially agreed then never followed up bugged me. From my perspective, you wouldn't treat a friend like that.

A month and a half later, I was sitting at lunch with a friend of hers when she joined us. She had mentioned planning a trip for the weekend, so I asked how it was. She said it was too difficult to organise, so she dropped the idea. She then mentioned that she and her friend had planned on grinding out coursework over the weekend, but that didn't happen either. As a slight jab, I said with a smile and a laugh:

""You keep making plans and promises then not keeping them.""

I just meant it as a little jab about what she had just said. To be honest, the texting incident wasn't on my mind, but maybe it was subconsciously. She laughed for a split second, but then it got quiet between her and her friend. The realisation of how it must have sounded hit me, and I just stayed silent. I regretted it the moment I realised it. The conversation eventually restarted, and I guess we all just pretended nothing happened.

I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I really don't want it to seem like I hold a grudge. I'm disappointed, but it is what it is. I'm just worried this comment made it look like I dislike her.",1,1759817561.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

It had been an auspicious day for the lizards to raid.

It was the 31^(st) anniversary of...of the accident.

My brother Samuel and I had been drinking, and we decided to try and recapture our youths by going out for a joyride in his Maserati Ghibli.

My memories are fragmented: getting behind the wheel. Gesticulating while talking with Samuel.

Then a bright light and an earth-shattering noise.

Nothing as...*unusual* as abduction of course...we had been struck side-on by an 18-wheeler.

He…

He didn't make it.

I'd never had the head for business, so I left the running of Van Parrish Industries to his mother Carol Pelt nee Van Parrish, my sister in law. She'd always had the head for numbers that I lacked, and she had run the company well, but…

She died.

Lung cancer.

Her tobacco habit and overworking, trying to be both mother and manager...it killed her.

My nephew Alan blamed me for the accident that left his mother a single mother, and for ruining the family's fortune.

Sometimes, after a few glasses of gin, the walls I have built convincing myself it's *not all my fault* crumble like the walls of Rome under the assault of the savage Visigoths.

And I *weep*.

I couldn't...I *can't* stand to lose what remains of my family, even if Alan (rightly) blamed me for it all...

It may sound odd, but we found reconciliation on that battlefield.



MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Alan Van Parrish

I had been...talking with Uncle Eb. He'd just sort of...shown up.

I'm honestly ashamed to admit it...but I'd been about to start yelling when-

**CRASH!**

An Arxur smashed through the downstairs bay window.

I didn't know it was an Arxur, I thought it was just some meth head, so I decided to go and try and settle things peacefully.

Uncle Eb immediately went for the gun safe and grabbed my great-grandfather's custom elephant gun, an old Winchester 1901 with a rifled barrel, rechambered in...I think it was black powder 12 bore elephant gun cartridges.

I ran downstairs to try and tell the guy to leave before my *crazy uncle* blew his head off.

I rounded the corner of the downstairs entryway into the living room, and stopped dead. Saying I was *incredibly* confused at what I saw is drastically understating it (Bear in mind, I'd never seen an Arxur before, so I'd wondered, briefly, if someone had slipped LSD into my morning coffee.)

""Ah, fresh meat!""

It spread its claws.

*Whuh huh?*

In that moment of confusion, the Arxur leapt on me, biting into my arm.

*It fucking hurt!*

The scaly bastard knocked me into a shelf, sending antique tchotchkes and books and Great-Great-Grandfather Angus Van Parrish's cavalry saber falling to the ground as I slid down the side, trying to grab on to something, *anything*, to break my fall.

**KSHHH!**

The glass display case shattered on the floor, and I seized the chance.

I stabbed the lizard in the mouth with a piece of glass, then grabbed the saber and hit the Arxur on the head with it.

I should...probably have removed the sheath first.

Thankfully, the one-two combo gave me the space I needed to crawl away, before-

**BOOM!**

**Thud!**

The Arxur's head disintegrated into a red mist and a rain of bone splinters, many of which embedded themselves in the Colonial paneling. The parquet floor. The ceiling.

*Oh God...*

I looked behind me to see Uncle Eb on the downstairs landing, lowering a smoking gun.

""Are you alright?...Dear God, you're *bleeding*, boy! Where do you keep the first-aid?""

*Guess Uncle Eb does care…*

""...Above the fridge.""

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Ebenezer Linus Van Parrish (Highly accomplished oldster who's about to add ""alien hunter"" to his resume)

*Well, I think this reunion went swimmingly.*

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

After that reptilian ruffian's cohorts had showed their besnouted faces, I had shot a further two as they entered the house through various unorthodox means, urged my nephew to grab a gun from the safe, and then stepped outside.

I found three more standing over the corpse of a postal worker, *eating* the corpse.

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

**Ch-Chak!**

My face wrinkling in disgust, I fired twice more, demolishing two of the bounders before the third threw some form of blade at me. It smashed the window of the rental Mercedes I had arrived in instead.

**KRSH!**

**BOOM!**

**HONK! HONK! HONK! HONK!**

Dodging quickly to the side as I had threw off my aim somewhat, and it *just* missed the larcenous lizard's ""gentleman area"" by a whisker.

The lizard broke and ran then.

**CLICK!**

*Blast, out of ammunition.*

""YOU MISERABLE COWARD! COME BACK AND FACE ME LIKE A MAN!""

I know not if the lizard heard me, the car alarm was rather deafening.

Alan joined me on my excursion. He had tied an improvised sling from scraps of the bay window curtains, to hold the saber in its sheath close to his body.

*Excellent.* ~~Perhaps through death I can find redemption~~

Near the graveyard on Adams Street, we encountered a crashed vehicle (an old Subaru Brat) with the driver and all passengers dead. It would appear that the vehicle rolled over and crushed everyone inside.

~~Their bodies were twisted and bloody like Sam's was, their splintered bones jutting from their flesh~~

I interrupted my spiral with a quick swig from my hip flask, and set to.

We made our way to a nearby gun store on 12^(th) and Leavitt, where I discovered they apparently didn't *sell* the necessary ammunition for the elephant gun, which was long out of production.

To be perfectly honest...fair enough. It's a custom rifle in an obscure antique caliber that was long obsolete even when grandfather Ulysses commissioned the piece. So I purchased a replacement weapon, a modified surplus M14 EBR marksman rifle with an integral suppressor and night-vision scope, and Alan purchased an…

*Oh.*

At first I thought that he'd wasted his money on a common M8 flare gun of all things, a surplus of the war against the Nazis, but *then* I observed its...*unorthodox* modifications.

I was...hesitant to ask where the manic-eyed young man in the gun store got it, or why it had been modified with a new custom barrel to accept *40mm grenades*...or why he asked to be paid in gold (a condition which I gladly acquiesced to under the understanding that Alan would pay me back in bills), but...I had to admit it would be quite useful.

Alan and I left the store.

""I didn't know you cared…""

*Oh Alan…*

I took a deep, fortifying breath.

""I...I suppose I owe you an apology for my distance throughout the years.""

Alan looked intrigued.

*I...I really am a bastard...*

""I…I suppose, deep down, I am but a miserable *coward*. I bury myself in roleplay of an era long past, I take up a *bounty hunting job* like some common scoundrel to roleplay as a hunter of men, I even *restructure my speech patterns* around 19^(th) century norms...but I…""

*Come on Ebenezer, keep your chin up. Come on, keep your chin up. Crying never helped anybody do anything, okay? You have a problem, you face it like a man...*

""Uncle Eb?""

*Alan is still concerned for me, even after all I have caused...*

""I...I…""

After an uncomfortable silence, I confessed.

""It's all my fault…I'm the reason Samue-...*Sam* is dead…""

**CRASH!**

My emotional spiral was interrupted by the sound of a 20-year-old Toyota Corolla roaring past us two, traveling at upwards of 90 miles per hour.

**Szr-r-r-r-r-rt!**

An old Honda 600 stalled on the other side of the street, and the owner got out and *bolted.*

At the end of the street, I saw lizards in some kind of...what was it called...*dune buggy* round the corner, before a 1974 Mercury Cougar with sizable rust spots struck it side on ~~like the 18 wheeler~~…

**Clang!**

...And the subframe fell out from the bottom of the car, taking the engine with it.

Some lizards swarmed the driver, others saw *us* and called reinforcements.

*Many* others showed their fanged snouts and ran for us.

""They're coming, Alan. Get ready.""

I raised my rifle.

Alan raised the ancestral saber in one hand and his new grenade pistol in the other.

""Harvest time,"" Alan said.

I'm not quite certain what he was referencing.

Having said that, I do have some suggestions:

1. When a challenge is complete, have the ability to go back and see both the general answer percentages and the challenge answer percentages. Currently, when you finish the challenge you can only see the challenge percentages, but if you navigate off and come back only the general percentages are displayed
2. Have a ""flag bank"" on the side where a user can place flags they thought of that might fit multiple spots but are waiting to use. Instead of my having a physical piece of paper to write down flags as I'm playing through the puzzle, have a virtual ""piece of paper"" I can use to put and flags I am thinking of using (without letting me know if it would fit or not). The number of times I've thought of the flag of the day, waited to use it to see where it would be most useful, and then forgot to place it, is embarrassing

WE HAVE LIFTOFF! Or should I say... flush-off?

The day is finally here, you guys. TOMORROW IS SURGERY DAY. I'm getting sleeved on October 8th, and the pre-op festivities have officially begun in the most... 😆🌋explosive way possible.

Let's start with the stats, because progress is what keeps us going:

· Admission Weight (8 days ago): 123 kg
· Today's Weight: 117 kg
· Total Pre-Op Loss: 6 kg (~13 lbs)! The liver-shrinking mission was a success!🎉🎉🎉

Now, for the main events of the day.

1. The Last Supper (Feat. One Sad Protein Shake with the personality of a cardboard box, and a delicious beef meal with hidden noddles underneath 🤗😻🙈):

Behold! (Pics attached). This magnificent feast, consumed at the royal hour of 12 PM noon, along with my 8AM loyal, coffee-flavored protein shake companion, was IT for today. The last caloric hurrah!!!🎉🎊

As of this meal, I am on a 48-hour food hiatus until at least the day AFTER surgery. Let that sink in... 

I've made peace with it...

I'm mentally prepared to become a graceful, floating spirit 🌬 sustained by air and hope.

2. The Great Purge of October 2025!!:

At 2 PM, the real party started. I was handed my ticket to the porcelain throne: a full, 250ml bottle of MAGCOROL (think industrial-strength drain cleaner, but for your intestines).

This is where I had a life-altering revelation:

I did a colon prep in the States once. You know the drill: they give you like a GALLON of fluid that tastes like a public swimming pool mixed with regret. You have to chug it for hours until your soul leaves your body. So....YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THERE WAS ALWAYS AN ALTERNATIVE?! This tiny 250ml bottle—basically the size of a large coffee cup—and the job gets done?!!!!!!!!!!WHY DO AMERICAN DOCTORS WANT US TO SUFFER? Is it a rite of passage? A test of mental fortitude? I feel betrayed, but also eternally grateful to be going through this in Japan, instead of in the States. My sincerest apologies to everyone back home suffering through the gallon of despair.

The instructions were simple: ""Drink this. You will not be leaving the bathroom for a while."" I think they were underselling it. My stomach and colon are currently tingling and rumbling as if they are getting ready to stage a full-scale revolt. It feels like my insides are about to be power-washed by a firehose. This doesn't feel like a system reboot; I think it's going to the motherboard being ripped out and hosed down in the driveway.

I'm allowed clear liquids (water/unsweetened tea) until midnight. After that? It's a complete blackout. I'm going to stare at water cooler commercials like they're food porn.

And in the ultimate display of medical understatement, I was formally instructed to skip all exercises today. 🤣😅 Apparently, all the sprinting🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ to the bathroom I'll be doing every 10 minutes will count as cardio 🤣🤣😅, so I think I'll still be hitting my goals👍. I'll basically be an athlete.

So here I am, strategically parked on my hospital bed with a direct sightline to the toilet, mentally preparing for the storm. It's gonna be a long night of... internal cleansing.

But you know what? I'm ready. So ready!!🔥💪 Lap Sleeve Gastrectomy, here we go! The next time I post, I'll be on the loser's bench!

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I make no apologies for being who i am though, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important.

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I’m normally a pretty active person, and my protein/calorie requirements are high. This shake completely replaced my meals and I only need one for up to 6 hours of energy. I consistently had three a day during recovery. Now I have two a day, and one dinner(jaw gets sore)

Ensure and all other protein shakes/soups were too thin and I was getting hungry/upset with the number of meals I had to have to feel normal.

Anyway, here it is:
Get a nutribullet. Without it, the texture is kind of powdery. Also, the container is what you drink out of, so less mess to clean.

Eyeball in a quarter to half cup frozen blueberries
Two-three cubes ice
Half cup rolled oats
Two scoops of black edition huel vanilla
Egg white, eyeball 2-3 tablespoons
Almond milk to the top
Spoon of peanut butter 
Water to thin down… the syringe I had to use required it to be thinned down by quite a bit

To vary, replace fruit with frozen banana, huel could be chocolate or coffee/chocolate
I’ve also done blueberry with chocolate which was good.

Bonus: huel can be used for fsa/hsa funds, so you can save a little on the taxes. 

Another note, you can get like 90% of the stuff on that list at Costco and you’ll be set for a while until you’re feeling strength to return. I stocked up and didn’t have to leave the house for a month and a half.

Chapteri 

My mother in law and I went to check out my husband’s new upscale hotel and have afternoon tea. 

The desserts looked exquisite, but the chocolate mousse was so icy it cracked my mother in law’s front 

tooth. 

I snapped a photo and demanded to see the manager. “Was this cake taken straight from the freezer and served?” 

The manager ripped the phone from my hand and flung it into a coffee cup, her face twisted with contempt. 

“Taking photos?!” she spat. 

“What are you two old hags doing – playing rich and making trouble?” 

“Haven’t you had enough? Filthy! That’s five hundred dollars for cleaning. Don’t even think about leaving without paying!” 

I forced my anger down. “Is this how Victor Harrington runs his team? Bring him out here.” 

She put her hands on her hips and laughed coldly. “So you came here just to test my staff, huh?”

At that moment a little boy not even a meter tall grabbed an ice cube from the table and hurled it at us 

with everything he had. 

“Don’t bully my mom!” he cried. 

I stopped, stunned. That little face looked impossibly like Victor’s. 

So his “overtime” on holidays wasn’t what he’d claimed: he’d been running a secret hotel and supporting a 

mistress and a child. 

Before I could react, the manager was already on the phone, shrieking. “Victor, come to the hotel now! Two fake rich women are harassing me and my child!” 

She jabbed a finger at the promotional board by the door and tossed her chin up in contempt. “Didn’t you see the sign? ‘No fake rich ladies or dogs’?” 

“I’ve never seen such shameless trash-ruining the standards of our place! Pay up and get out!” 

“Cat got your tongue? What, you two want to pay with your bodies? No one would touch you even in a 

shelter!” 

She sneered, pinched her nose, and went on. “I bet your stockings were bought in bulk online-shared by a dozen people. Gross.” 

“Or maybe you’re putting on a show to lure rich men?” 

“Everyone, look! These two old women are here to seduce men! Watch out for romance scams!”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

Nikosame idi, dha occheyy!!!","I hope you're reading this somewhere warm, with a soft blanket wrapped around your shoulders, maybe a cup of coffee or chai in your hands. If not, I hope this post becomes that little warm corner for you, just for a few minutes.We’re entering what I like to call the winter arc of the year.

And no, I don’t just mean the chill in the air or the shorter days, I mean this season of life that feels quiet, maybe even heavy. It’s that time when everything seems slower, when the world seems to retreat inward, and when we start reflecting on the months gone by.

To all my bondhaas and bondhiniss out there—whether you’re tucked away in Vizag, struggling in the bustle of Hyderabad, chasing dreams in the US, or working long hours in a new city..........this post is for you.

The Season of Silence 🍁

Winter teaches us something important. Trees don’t resist shedding their leaves. They stand bare, vulnerable, and still. And in that stillness, they prepare for something powerful: growth.Maybe you're in your own version of winter right now. Maybe life has slowed down for you. Maybe you feel behind. Maybe you're wondering if all this effort you're putting in will ever bloom into something meaningful.

It will. I promise, it will. You're Not Alone

I know many of us don’t often speak about what we’re going through. In Telugu households, we’re raised to be strong, to keep going no matter what. And that’s powerful. But it also means we carry a lot silently. We carry expectations, dreams, responsibilities—sometimes without even letting ourselves breathe.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, let me tell you this:

You are not alone.

Many of us are going through our own silent battles. Some are dealing with job pressures, some with heartbreaks, some with financial struggles, and some just trying to make sense of who they are in this world. And yet, every day we get up and try. That itself is courage.

This Winter Arc is for the Builders ❄️

You know how every anime or movie has that one “training arc”? The part where the hero isn’t flashy, isn’t winning battles, but is slowly and painfully building themselves up? That’s what this winter is for. This is your training arc. The time where the real work happens behind the scenes.

Work hard now. Study with sincerity. Save your energy. Learn to enjoy your own company. Build your habits. Cook for yourself. Write. Meditate. Take care of your mind. This is not the time to rush; it’s the time to root.

We don’t grow flowers by pulling at them. We grow them by tending the soil, by watering, by being patient. Right now, it’s okay if there are no visible results. What matters is that you’re showing up for yourself every day.

A Message from Home

Sometimes, being away from home makes winter feel colder. If you’re far from your parents, your village, the smell of hot sambar, the sound of TV serials playing in the background, or that warm smile from your ammamma or nanamma—it’s okay to miss them. It's okay to cry a little.

We come from a culture of resilience. Of farmers who wait patiently for their crops. Of weavers who spend hours perfecting every thread. Of artists who speak poetry in silence. That strength is in your blood, whether you feel it or not.

Even in this winter arc, you carry that fire.
Everything’s Going to Be Okay.
Let me remind you of something simple but powerful:

You’ve already survived everything you once thought you couldn’t. Think back to a moment that broke you. One that made you feel like you’d never get past it. And yet, here you are. Maybe still healing, maybe still struggling, but here. That’s no small thing.

Everything you’re dreaming of—peace, love, success, stability—it’s not as far as it seems. It’s coming to you, slowly, like sunlight creeping through fog. Keep walking.

You don’t need to have it all figured out right now. You just need to take one more step. And then one more after that. You’re allowed to take breaks. You’re allowed to feel tired. Just don’t give up. This is temporary. Winter always feels endless until the first bloom appears.

idhigo mundhe cheptuna, ivi marchipokandey!!!!

Call your parents if you can. They miss you more than you think.

Don’t compare your journey to others. Flowers bloom at different times.

Be kind to yourself. Speak to yourself like you would to a younger sibling.

Sleep well. Drink water. Move your body. These small things matter.

Celebrate tiny wins. Even getting out of bed on tough days is a victory.

Closing This Entry… Like a Warm Hug 🤍

So to you, idhi chadutunav kada intha peddadi chadivinav ante idi kuda chaduthav chadiveseyyy

Take a deep breath.
Exhale.
Place your hand on your heart.
Feel it? That’s hope, still beating. That’s you, still here. Still trying.

This winter arc won’t last forever. But what you build in it will. Your habits, your strength, your character—they're forming now, quietly and steadily.

And one day, not too far from now, you’ll look back at this moment and thank yourself for not giving up. Until then, be gentle with yourself. Be proud of how far you’ve come. And keep going.

We’re all in this together.

With warmth,

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1o06e4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRSUK/comments/1o06e4m/energyefficient_commercial_fridges_in_uk_cut/,Energy‑efficient commercial fridges in UK: Cut running costs without losing performance,"Energy bills are a major overhead for kitchens, cafes, bars and retail. Choosing and using energy‑efficient [commercial fridges in uk](https://trs-uk.co.uk/fridge/) can reduce costs, improve temperature stability, and extend equipment life. This guide explains what to look for, how to estimate running costs, and practical steps to lower energy use—plus where to find efficient models at TRS UK.

https://preview.redd.it/p4fqjttlmmtf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd65703a5ee7b12fecef98afc008e44fb989998f

**Why efficiency matters for UK businesses**

* Lower operating costs: Small efficiency gains add up across multiple units.
* Better temperature control: Efficient designs hold +1°C to +5°C more consistently.
* Compliance and sustainability: Reduced kWh use supports ESG goals and HACCP records.

**What makes a fridge energy‑efficient?**

* Energy label and kWh/24h
   * Check the spec sheet for the energy class and daily energy consumption (kWh/24h). Lower kWh means lower bills.
* Refrigerant and compressor
   * Hydrocarbon refrigerants like R290 are efficient and widely used in modern commercial cabinets.
   * Variable‑speed or high‑efficiency compressors and ECM/EC fans reduce power draw.
* Insulation and door design
   * Thicker insulation, tight door gaskets, and self‑closing doors minimise cold air loss.
   * Triple‑glazed glass on display units cuts heat gain without sacrificing visibility.
* Cooling system and controls
   * Fan‑assisted cooling provides even temperatures and faster recovery.
   * Digital controllers with adaptive defrost, door alarms, and temperature logging improve stability and reduce ice build‑up.
* Climate class
   * For hot UK kitchens, look for Climate Class 4 (30°C) or 5 (40°C) to maintain performance in higher ambient temperatures.

**How to estimate running costs**

Use this simple formula:  
Annual cost (£) = kWh per day × 365 × your electricity rate (£/kWh)

Example:

* Fridge A uses 3.2 kWh/day at £0.30/kWh → 3.2 × 365 × 0.30 ≈ £350/year
* Fridge B uses 2.1 kWh/day at £0.30/kWh → 2.1 × 365 × 0.30 ≈ £230/year Savings ≈ £120/year. If Fridge B costs £250 more, payback is about 2.1 years.

**Practical ways to cut energy use today**

* Keep condensers clean: Brush/vacuum coils every 6-8 weeks.
* Protect door seals: Replace split or loose gaskets; keep them clean so doors close tightly.
* Allow airflow: Maintain ventilation clearances and don’t block internal fans.
* Load correctly: Cool product before loading, avoid over‑packing, and leave space for air to circulate.
* Set the right temperature: Most chilled food is safe at +3°C to +5°C; avoid “colder than necessary” settings.
* Position smartly: Keep fridges away from ovens, dishwashers, and direct sunlight.
* Use night blinds/doors on multidecks: Reduces heat gain during closed hours.
* Defrost with intent: Use automatic/adaptive defrost if available; avoid frequent manual door‑open defrosts.

# Choosing the right efficient model for your venue

* Restaurants and production kitchens
   * Upright stainless steel storage, Climate Class 4/5, fan‑assisted cooling, robust hinges, and lockable castors.
* Cafes, bars, and coffee shops
   * Back‑bar bottle coolers with LED lighting, EC fans and triple‑glazed doors; undercounter fridges for prep stations.
* Convenience and retail
   * Glass‑door uprights or multidecks with night blinds, efficient lighting, and accurate digital controllers.
* Bakeries and delis
   * Serve‑over counters with LED lighting and anti‑mist glass; check kWh/24h and insulation quality.

**Pre‑purchase checklist**

* Capacity you need (litres, GN compatibility) with 15-20% headroom
* External dimensions, door swing, and access route for delivery
* Climate class that suits your ambient temperature
* Energy consumption (kWh/24h) and estimated annual cost
* Interior/exterior finish (stainless vs coated), shelf configuration
* Warranty, parts availability, and UK service support

**Why buy from TRS UK**

* Wide choice of efficient upright, undercounter, counter, and display models
* Clear specifications, including kWh/24h, to help you compare running costs
* Competitive pricing, UK‑wide delivery, and helpful support

I started off the week with my **Shumate Barber De Luxe** 5/8"" hollow round-point straight razor. I've had it since the beginning of the year, but haven't shaved with it for several months. I was a little worried I'd forgotten how, but it all came back to me (
(like riding the proverbial bike, I guess). Next up was a new-to-me **H. Boker ""Our Very Own""** 11/16 hollow square-point razor from ""our very own"" r/martinsrazors. What a fantastic razor! Sharp and smooth and just a joy to use.  I didn't have time for a straight razor shave the rest of the week, so I turned to my trusty **1967 Gillette Slim** to get the job done, and did it ever. With a **Feather Hi-Stainless** on setting 5, it was smooth and comfortable.

The hardware was supported by some great software. The Summer Break Soap base is fantastic - great cushion, slickness, and protection. Definitely top-tier, and the scents are wonderful as well. 

* **Daydream**: the passion fruit came through the most for me. Not overpowering, though, and well supported by the other notes (lemon, bergamot, grass). Thoroughly enjoyable. 

* **Prom King**: probably my favorite of the trio. Makes me want to look closer at Jean Paul Gaultier's fragrances (Prom King is was inspired by ""Le Male""). 

* **Wood Shop**: a very mild scent to me. I was expecting lots of wood - it was there, but definitely in the background. I didn't get a lot of coffee and bourbon either. I did get a whiff of the motor oil (which I did enjoy). Maybe my nose was just a bit off that day. 

The soaps were lathered with my two favorite brushes: a **Chisel and Hound Dog's Breakfast / 26mm White Boar** and an **Aurora Grooming W_E Nebula / 26 mm G5B synthetic**.

Chapter 1 

My husband has bipolar disorder. The color red sends him into a violent rage. 

Since we got married, I’ve only worn red twice. The first time, he went berserk and cracked my head open–I ended up in the ER needing stitches. 

The second time, he beat me so badly I lost the baby. I was three months pregnant. 

After that, I never wore red again. I was so afraid of setting him off that even my underwear was plain white. 

The day I got out of the hospital after the miscarriage, I was passing by the dining room**,** clutching my stomach, when I saw him—my husband, who claimed to be working overtime–having dinner 

with a female student. 

His eyes were full of admiration, brimming with affection. They couldn’t help themselves, swaying into a slow dance right there at the table. 

Right then, the doctor’s office called, voice full of excitement. “Mrs. Whitmore, we’ve developed a new treatment plan for Mr. Whitmore’s condition-” 

I looked at the swirl of red from the girl’s dress, smiled bitterly, and said, “Don’t bother. The problem’s already been solved.” 

“Wait, what? We’ve been researching this for months and still couldn’t figure out the source of Mr. Whitmore’s episodes!” the doctor said, clearly excited. “This solution came from extensive consultations with a panel of experts-” 

I slowly looked up. The girl upstairs was dancing a clumsy waltz, stepping all over his feet. And then, something inside me snapped–I laughed. The kind of laugh that comes with tears. 

Maybe the problem was never him*.* Maybe it was that… I never should’ve been Mrs. Whitmore in the first place. 

I didn’t stay to watch the rest of their little performance. I went home. 

Opening my closet, I stared at the row of red dresses hanging neatly inside. Before I got married, red was my favorite color. But because Damian Whitmore couldn’t stand to see me in it, I shoved them all to the back and let them collect dust. 

But this time, I wasn’t going to play his game anymore. I wasn’t going to be part of the joke.

When he came home, what he saw was me–sitting there in a crimson dress, calmly sipping

He lunged at me, hands closing tightly around my neck. “Didn’t I tell you never to wear that 

color?” 

His fist drew back, ready to strike–then froze mid–air. His expression twisted in pain.

With a faint smile, I met his eyes. “Damian. Didn’t you say you loved me? I want to see if you can control yourself–for me.” 

He held back so hard the veins in his hands bulged. In the end, he shattered a wine bottle, slicing

He noticed something was off. His eyes opened. “Isabella, you’re still mad?” 

I stayed quiet.

In this guide, we break down the key specs, types, and buying tips for commercial fridges in uk so you can make a confident choice-and easily order online from TRS UK.

[Commercial fridge in UK](https://preview.redd.it/d8krcks5kmtf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=164fdbb8014ab9c5c17da95a1a4cbe30485c5835)

**What types of commercial fridges are available?**

* Upright fridges (single or double door): Tall capacity, ideal for kitchens with limited floor space. Great for back-of-house storage.
* Undercounter fridges: Space-saving units that slide beneath worktops; perfect for bars, coffee stations, and prep areas.
* Counter/prep fridges (GN counters): Worktop plus refrigerated storage below; designed for fast prep with gastronorm compatibility.
* Display fridges and multidecks: Promote grab‑and‑go drinks, dairy, and packaged foods while keeping them at safe temperatures.
* Back bar bottle coolers: Compact, glass‑fronted units for bars and pubs; showcase bottled drinks and cans.
* Serve-over counters/patisserie displays: Refrigerated glass displays for delis and bakeries. Tip: Map your workflow. Place fridges where staff reach them most, reducing steps and saving time.

**Key specs that matter in the UK**

* Capacity and size
   * Litres and GN compatibility (1/1, 2/1) affect how much you can store.
   * Check external dimensions, door swing, and whether it fits through your doorways and corridors.
* Temperature range and control
   * Typical fridge range: +1°C to +5°C. Look for precise digital controllers and easy-to-read displays.
   * Fan-assisted cooling provides faster, more even temperatures than static cooling.
* Climate class (ambient temperature rating)
   * Class 3: Tested at 25°C; Class 4: 30°C; Class 5: 40°C. Hot UK kitchens often benefit from Class 4 or 5 for stable performance.
* Build quality
   * Stainless steel interiors/exteriors are durable and easier to clean. 304-grade is highly corrosion-resistant.
   * Self-closing doors, replaceable door gaskets, heavy-duty hinges, and castors make life easier.
* Energy efficiency and running costs
   * Check kWh/24h consumption and the energy label. LED lighting, efficient compressors, and better insulation reduce bills.
   * Modern fridges commonly use hydrocarbon refrigerants like R290 for efficiency and lower environmental impact.
* Noise and ventilation
   * Note dB levels if the unit sits front-of-house. Ensure adequate clearance around vents to prevent overheating.
* Power and installation
   * Many units are 13A plug-and-play; larger models may require dedicated circuits. Always check the spec sheet.

**How to choose the right unit for your business**

1. Start with the menu and stock profile
   * High turnover of chilled ingredients? Consider larger upright storage.
   * Mostly bottled drinks? Back bar coolers or multidecks are ideal.
2. Measure twice, deliver once
   * Double-check access routes, lifts, and door widths. Ask about kerbside vs. two‑person delivery.
3. Prioritise reliability and serviceability
   * Choose brands with readily available parts. Look for clear warranties and UK support.
4. Balance upfront price vs. lifetime cost
   * A more efficient fridge can pay for itself. Example: If Model A saves 2 kWh/day at £0.30/kWh, that’s \~£219/year saved.
5. Plan cleaning and maintenance
   * Schedule regular condenser cleaning, check door seals, keep vents clear, and defrost if required to prolong lifespan.

**Compliance and food safety in the UK**

* Keep refrigerators between 1 °C and 5 °C for optimal chilled food safety.
* Use a digital controller or data logging to track temperatures (useful for HACCP).
* Store raw and ready-to-eat foods separately to prevent cross-contamination.
* Train staff to load fridges correctly, don’t block airflow around the fan and vents.

Common mistakes to avoid

* Overloading shelves disrupts airflow and warms the cabinet.
* Placing fridges beside ovens or in direct sunlight.
* Ignoring climate class units rated for cooler rooms will struggle in hot kitchens.
* Skipping routine maintenance can lead to higher energy consumption and increased breakdowns.

1o062f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatfamCrossovers/comments/1o062f8/fanfic_prompt_au_idea_marinette_as_gothams/,Fanfic Prompt / AU Idea: Marinette as Gotham’s Guardian & MDC Fashion Icon,"Okay so I just had the craziest idea ever and I need to put it somewhere before I explode—bear with me, this is chaotic and probably messy but also AMAZING.

So imagine this: years after Marinette defeats Shadowmoth and Lila and everything in Paris just… goes downhill. She’s like, okay city’s falling apart, I gotta fix this. She makes this insane wish with Plagg and Tikki to repair Paris. She can’t sacrifice herself because she’s the Guardian, right? So what does she do? She sacrifices everyone’s memory of the heroes in Paris. And that’s not enough, so she also takes everyone’s memory of akumatizations and even their memory of her. And then she feels everything. Like all of the sadness, grief, anger, fear—she feels it all at once. It’s overwhelming, but she does it anyway because she loves her city more than anything.

Fast forward a couple years. She’s 17–19, still the Guardian but kind of a shadow. She protects Paris like this Ladybug-Cat Noir fusion thing, sometimes even makes a dome around the city that keeps it safe so it doesn’t even need heroes anymore. She watches her friends and family from afar for two years, keeping them safe without anyone knowing it. And at 19 she’s like… okay. Paris is safe. Time to live my life and help somewhere else. Gotham. Hello.

So now she restarts her fashion career under the alias MDC, becomes this super famous but mysterious designer. And she leans more into Cat Noir’s fighting style—swings her yo-yo, uses a bo staff, hair down to her hips, sometimes transforms with magical hair styles like knee-length braids, buns, pigtails, etc. Everyone knows MDC, nobody knows her as Marinette.

Enter Tim Drake, also 19, a few months older. CEO of Wayne Enterprises, distancing himself from the Wayne family, exhausted from life, basically doesn’t socialize. He meets MDC over coffee (their one quiet normal escape from the chaos of Gotham and WayneCorp). At first he doesn’t think much of her, but she laughs at his dry, dark humor and suddenly he’s obsessed—protective, attached, sibling-like energy but flirty in tiny ways.

They develop a routine. He can just exist with her, she can exist with him—no vigilante masks, no pressure, just teasing, coffee, banter. Neither of them knows the other is a hero/vigilante. It’s the one “normal” thing in their life.

Also, trauma moments. Marinette has episodes sometimes—can’t feel sadness, anger, or anything because past akuma stuff—and he just knows how to help. Hums a song he’s heard her sing before, braids her hair until she’s back, and later practices on mannequins at the Manor while everyone freaks out (“why are you braiding a mannequin WHILE HUMMING?”).

Chaos hits when the Batfam gets involved:

Steph sees a girl’s shirt in Tim’s room (he steals her clothes sometimes, even though she makes them for him) and thinks he has a girlfriend. She tails him, finds out it’s Marinette/Pixie, and tells the family.

Jason Red Hood meets Marinette first when picking Tim up. Sees them teasing and laughing together. Notices her sass and how she calls him out for scaring a cat with guns. Instantly becomes obsessed/protective, secretly nicknames her Pixie.

Tim freaks quietly on comms because she keeps removing his trackers while the Batfam erupts in chaos: dibs, arguments, “you gotta meet her,” “she sounds amazing,” etc.



Marinette’s in one of those episodes where she just shuts down. She’s not crying, she’s not yelling, she’s just gone behind her eyes. Years of conditioning—of telling herself don’t feel too much, or you’ll break everything around you—and it finally snaps under Gotham’s pressure.

Tim’s instincts scream to analyze it, to fix it, to ask a hundred questions. But something stops him—maybe it’s the way her hands are trembling, or the way she’s staring at nothing like she’s watching ghosts. So instead of interrogating her, he does something utterly un-Tim-like: he gets quiet.

He leads her somewhere away from the noise, maybe her studio or his office at the top of Wayne Tower with the city lights below them. He just… sits her down. No questions. No plans. Just presence.

Then he starts humming this little tune he’s caught her singing absentmindedly before—soft, lilting, something that sounds like Paris. It fills the silence like a thread, grounding her.

And while he hums, he starts braiding her hair. Carefully. Gently. Hands steady even though his heart’s pounding because he doesn’t know what he’s doing, just that it feels right.

When she finally blinks and comes back, her voice is small, hoarse:

> “You… practiced.”
And he just gives that half-shrug, half-smile.
“Had to make sure I didn’t make you look like a 2012 YouTube tutorial.”



Then later, back at the Manor, he’s actually in the training room, straight-faced, practicing different braid styles on a mannequin head while humming her song under his breath.

Dick walks by and just stops dead.

> “Are… you okay?”
“Fine.”
“That mannequin’s wearing one of your hoodies.”
“It gets cold in here.”
“You’re humming.”
“So?”
“You don’t hum, Tim.”
“I do now.”

And him begging her—half-joking, half-serious—

> “Please, Nette. Just tell me who MDC is. I swear I’ll buy you an entire coffee shop. You can live in it. You can bathe in espresso if that’s what it takes.”
And she just smirks, leaning back with that quiet, mischievous glint in her eye:
“You wouldn’t survive owning a coffee shop. You’d drink the profits.”

Like—picture it.

It’s one of those late nights that just happen between them. She’s sketching something at her desk, soft jazz humming in the background, and Tim’s half-dead from CEOing all week. He drags himself over to her couch with a muttered, “I’m just gonna check this one email.”

Two hours later: man’s flat on his back, head pillowed in her lap, phone in hand, eyes at half-mast. He’s scrolling through endless Wayne Enterprises data like a zombie while she absently threads her fingers through his hair, just grounding him in this quiet, domestic little bubble they never talk about.

And then—he squints at his phone screen, mumbling:

> “MDC just filed another patent request through an offshore subsidiary…”
A pause.
“Weird. She’s using the same encryption format as—”



Then his brain clicks. Like a light switch.

His eyes SNAP open. He sits straight up so fast he nearly headbutts her.

> “YOU’RE MDC. YOU’RE—oh my god, I’m so dumb. IT’S YOUR INITIALS.”



And she’s just sitting there, blinking like 😐 while trying not to laugh because she knew this day was coming.

Salary-56100 per month(I'm in one of the uniform services of the state).The salary would increase to around 75k(obv speculations) post 8th pay commission.With promotions/DA increase etc it might go to 1 lakh a month in 5 years time

Location-Tier 2/3 city in North West India

Family-Not dependent on me as both are state government employees too(professor and junior school teacher in government institutions with pension and own house)

Monthly spends-

Rent-6000 rupees for one room set

Food-4500 including everything(I eat 2 meals a day total cost is 150 for a day this includes 5 eggs).I don't/rarely eat outside. I don't drink/smoke/consume coffee)

Other expenses-Gym fees(700 rupees a month) cricket game every weekend cost 150 rupees per match. Fuel cost 1000 rupees(matches are played around 20-25 km far).I own a splendor right now and no plans of owning a car(might have to though).Other expenses also includes miscellaneous expenses like daily needs etc.I don't travel for leisure.Own samsung M32 for 15k purchased 4 years ago.I don't own laptop/pc because I have no requirement of it.

Total monthly spends-22k a month roughly

Medical covered by the government

Savings and investments-Might sound crazy but I don't really go bonkers on this and put mostly in PPF, RD, post office FD. NPS is deducted too for us. As I said luckily don't have dependents as parents are self sufficient so not much intention to create money etc.Regarding owning house/property/land I don't have a solid reason as to why I should do it(family already own the house they live in in hometown)

Future Planning-I plan to work for number of years and create/save enough money to open a cricket academy and if it starts giving me enough money to cover personal expenses and some more I'll leave the job and take into the academy full time.2 coaches leased land other equipment its a slight costly affair but I love it when I'm on the cricket field the whole day and I'd love it. 

I don't plan to marry/have kids/livein ever that too frees me up a bit. I am inspired by coach Tarak Sinha of DDCA who too dedicated his entire life to churning out cricketers(Ashish Nehra Pant to name a few). Obviously he's a big name(now no more sadly he passed away) but I'd love to follow footsteps.

# Chapter 1

“Andrea, If you can get that loser to drink from the same bottle you did, I’ll date you.” 



I blinked. 

Henry Rummell stood there, one eyebrow raised, that smug smile already loading another hit. 

The rich kids around us jumped in. 

“Come on, Andrea! You’ve been after Henry forever—he’s finally saying yes!” 

“I’m so over that Noah guy. Straight A’s don’t make him better than us.” 

“Let him grind all he wants—he’ll be fetching our coffee in ten years.” 

Their laughter felt like a vice around my lungs. Couldn’t breathe. 

Henry and I grew up in the same ritzy neighborhood. The rest of them? D.C. nepo brats with last names that opened doors. 

Bullying was their group sport. I never joined, but I never stopped it either. 

Pissing them off could tank my dad’s business, and I used to think staying quiet was enough. 

In my last life, I finally confessed to Henry. His response? If I got Noah Novak to drink from a bottle I’d already used, he’d date me. 

It felt wrong. But I was sixteen. And stupid. And in love. 

So yeah, I did it. 

To quiet the guilt, I slipped Noah a thousand bucks. 

He took the cash, drank the water, and from then on? Wouldn’t even look at me. Just kept his head down like I didn’t exist. 

I didn’t care. I was too wrapped up in Henry. 

After college, everything crashed. 

Dad’s company tanked—he jumped off a building. Mom got cancer. 

Henry? He cheated, made me get an abortion, then tossed me out. 

A degree no one cared about and zero real skills. I ended up scrubbing floors at some club just to keep Mom’s treatments going. 

“Don’t say I’m heartless,” Henry would sneer. “My girl wants a laugh. Bark like a dog, Andrea. I’ll toss you two hundred.” 

Every time he had a new girl, he pulled the same twisted stunt. 

His crew came to watch. Even Peggy—my ex-best friend—joined in. 

“Princess Andrea, shine my shoes. On your knees. Twenty bucks.” 

“I’m gonna puke. Catch it with your hands and I’ll give you a hundred.” 

I used to wonder how people lived on fifty bucks a day. 

Then I started living it. Swallowing my pride, blinking back tears, and smiling through gritted teeth. 

“Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma’am.” 

Dignity? 

Doesn’t pay for chemo. 

When they started egging me on to strip, Noah walked in. Took me out of there. 

Sharp suit. Quiet power. 

I couldn’t even lift my head. Just stared at his polished shoes, watching my wrecked reflection in the floor. 

I thought he came to humiliate me. 

But he didn’t. 

He paid for my mom’s treatment and told me to stop crying. 

How was I supposed to hold it in? 

That same day, after he covered the bill, my mom—thinking she was just a burden—took her own life. 

Dad was gone. 

Now Mom, too. 

I had no one. 

Noah kept me close and said, “I’ll be your family now.” 

When I told him I wanted to rebuild my dad’s company, he backed me—no hesitation. Time, money, everything. Anytime I hit a wall, he was already there. 

He was brilliant, patient, kind in ways I’d never known. 

Falling for him? Easy. 

But just when I was ready to tell him, he said, “I don’t ever plan on getting married.” 

He said it like it was no big deal. 

I felt… stupid. Embarrassed. Maybe even ashamed. 

Because the man he’d become? 

I didn’t deserve him. 

Noah worked himself into the ground. Right after his company went public—boom. Late-stage liver cancer. 

He hated hospitals. Moved into a riverside villa instead. 

I tried to stay, but he shoved me away. Said awful things, just to make me go. 

I left. But he was miserable without me. 

So I came back. “Don’t send me away, Noah,” I begged. 

He was all bones, too weak to move. First thing he did? Cover my eyes. 

“Don’t look at me,” he whispered. “I’m ugly.” 

I still couldn’t stay. 

Never even got to say goodbye. 

His lawyer told me later—Noah left everything to me. 

But I didn’t care about the money. I just wanted him to live. 

I dragged myself up Mount Calvary Church’s steps, where people said prayers came true. 

Dropped to my knees. Begged God to give Noah peace. Maybe even a better life next time. 

I didn’t expect that walking back down…

I’m watching a documentary on utensils and they got to the teaspoon and they mentioned the historical British affection for tea, and that reminded me that growing up I always remember hearing how you all would have mandatory tea time every single day. Tbh, it sounds pretty ridiculous as I’m typing this out, but that was childhood me haha! 

Anyway, while I of course now know that tea time isn’t mandatory, I’m wondering if tea is still super popular over there? Is it like what coffee is in the US over there and everyone is drinking it all of the time/talking about it? Or has that died down?

 \---

**Picks (1/2)**

\-MIL Brewers -1.5 (+155) ✅

\-KC Chiefs -3.5 (-110) ❌

 \---

**Player Props (2/4)**

\-KC Chiefs v JAX Jaguars: Travis Kelce Anytime TD (+155) ✅

\-LA Dodgers v PHI Phillies: Blake Snell Over 7.5 Strikeouts (-105) ✅

‍-KC Chiefs v JAX Jaguars: Xavier Worthy Over 57.5 Receiving Yards (-110) ❌

 \-KC Chiefs v JAX Jaguars: Travis Etienne Anytime TD (+115) ❌

 \--

I have to say, **I can't believe Kansas City sh\*t the bed there at the end.** That Pass Interference call on 3rd down in the Red Zone was the final nail in the coffin – I still can't believe it.

**Thank God the Milwaukee Brewers play came through.** I know the RL was bold as hell, but I'm glad it paid off! 👊🏽☺️ 

**To summarize: Our bankrolls basically came out of this day unscathed** – no crazy losses to report.

On that note, I'm off for the night! As always, I'll see you all bright and early to conquer the books :)

🌸 Want to Practice Japanese? Meet a Native Speaker in Manila!

Hi everyone! 👋

I have a Japanese friend currently staying in Manila, and he’s been feeling a bit lonely lately. He’s a native Japanese speaker and would love to meet people who want to practice conversational Japanese in a relaxed, friendly setting.

I thought it’d be nice to organize a small meetup (or even just casual chats over coffee or online messages) so both sides can connect — you get to practice Japanese for free, and he gets some good company while in the Philippines. 🇯🇵🤝🇵🇭

💬 What we’re looking for:
	•	Anyone interested in Japanese language exchange or cultural conversation
	•	Friendly, open-minded people (no pressure, just casual talks!)
	•	Can meet in person (somewhere public like a café) or chat online

If you’d like to join or know someone who might, please send me a message or comment below! I’ll arrange introductions. 🌿

Let’s build a small community of Japan-loving friends here in Manila 💫

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

But keeping that fresh, glowing look needs some care. At **Northlane Dental**, we want your whitening results to stick around for as long as they can. With the right habits and focus, you can enjoy your bright smile for months — even years.

# 1. Stay Away From Foods and Drinks That Stain

After whitening, your teeth are more likely to stain. Cut down on coffee, tea red wine dark sodas, and foods like berries or soy sauce. If you do have these, rinse your mouth with water right after. Using a straw for drinks can also help keep them from touching your teeth .

# 2. Practice Good Oral Hygiene

Brush your teeth twice a day and floss to keep your teeth clean and stop plaque from building up. Pick a soft-bristled toothbrush and whitening toothpaste your dentist recommends. Good oral care doesn't just protect your teeth - it also helps them stay bright.

# 3. Schedule Regular Dental Cleanings

Professional cleanings at Northlane Dental get rid of plaque and tartar that regular brushing can't remove. Visit at least every six months to keep your teeth healthy and shiny. These check-ups also let our team track your whitening progress over time.

# 4. Quit Smoking and Tobacco Use

Tobacco plays a big role in making teeth yellow. When you stop smoking, you boost your overall health and keep your smile brighter for a longer time. Staying away from tobacco products can stretch out how long your whitening lasts.

# 5. Rinse and Drink Water Often

Swishing water in your mouth throughout the day helps wash away bits of food and stops stains from sticking. Drinking lots of water also gets your mouth to make more spit, which cleans and shields your teeth.

# 6. Touch-Up Treatments When You Need Them

It's normal for teeth to lose some of their shine over time. Northlane Dental offers safe and easy touch-up whitening treatments to freshen up your smile whenever you feel it's needed.

By sticking to these easy steps and keeping up with regular dental visits, you can keep your smile bright and beautiful for a long time. At **Northlane Dental**, we're here to help make sure your teeth stay sparkling, so you can smile with confidence.",1,1759812671.0,u_northlanedental,0,1.0,False

1o05k1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_enhanceresume/comments/1o05k1b/made_a_lateral_move_3_years_ago_just_got_promoted/,"Made a ""lateral"" move 3 years ago, just got promoted to director. Here's why sideway moves are actually power moves","This might be controversial, but hear me out: sometimes the best way to move up is to move sideways first.

**My story:**  
3 years ago, I was a senior marketing manager feeling stuck. Promotion opportunities were rare, and I was getting pigeonholed. Then I heard about an opening in product management – same level, slightly different pay, completely different department.

Everyone thought I was making a mistake. ""Why aren't you going up?""

**Here's what actually happened:**

**Year 1:** Made lateral move from Marketing Manager to Product Manager

* Negotiated 12% salary increase (yes, you can negotiate lateral moves!)
* Learned completely new skillset
* Built relationships across engineering, design, sales

**Year 2:** Promoted to Senior Product Manager

* Had advantage because I understood marketing side
* 25% salary increase

**Year 3:** Just got promoted to Director of Product

* My marketing background made me the obvious choice
* 35% salary increase
* Total: 84% salary increase in 3 years

**Why lateral moves are underrated:**

**1. You become irreplaceable**  
Cross-functional knowledge is rare. I'm now the bridge between marketing and product – and companies will pay premium for that.

**2. You expand your network exponentially**  
Instead of knowing 20 people in marketing, I now know 100+ people across the organization. When opportunities arise, people think of me.

**3. You break out of your box**  
Marketing had limited upward mobility. Product has way more growth opportunities. Sometimes you need to change lanes to accelerate.

**4. You can still negotiate**  
""Lateral"" doesn't mean ""equal."" I positioned it as:

* Taking on new responsibilities
* Bringing unique cross-functional perspective
* Expanding my impact on the business

**How I approached my boss:**  
""I've been thinking about my long-term career goals, and I'd love to gain experience in product management. I think my marketing background would bring a unique perspective to the product team, and it would make me more valuable to the company overall. Can we discuss how to make this transition happen?""

**Key points:**

* Framed it as growth, not escape
* Showed how it benefits the company
* Offered to help transition my responsibilities
* Expressed gratitude for their mentorship

**When lateral moves make sense:**

* Limited upward mobility in your current function
* Want to switch career paths but stay at same company
* Need broader experience for future leadership roles
* Hit a ceiling due to departmental structure

**Red flags to avoid:**

* Don't make lateral moves to escape problems (they'll follow you)
* Don't move without a clear long-term strategy
* Don't burn bridges with current manager
* Don't accept lateral moves with pay cuts (unless strategic)

**Practical tips:**

**Research first:**

* Understand the new department's challenges and opportunities
* Know who you'd be reporting to
* Research salary ranges for the new role

**Timing matters:**

* Make the move when you're performing well, not struggling
* Ideally when the new department has growth opportunities
* Not right after a poor performance review

**Negotiate everything:**

* Base salary
* Title (sometimes you can get a better title)
* Start date
* Learning and development budget
* Reporting structure

**For anyone considering this:**  
Don't think of it as moving sideways. Think of it as building a foundation for something bigger.

The most successful executives I know have experience across multiple functions. They didn't get there by going straight up – they got there by going wide first.

**Questions for the group:**

* Have you made lateral moves that paid off?
* What's holding you back from considering one?
* Any specific situations you want advice on?

**Edit:** Getting lots of DMs asking about how to find lateral opportunities within your company. Some tips:

* Build relationships with other department heads
* Volunteer for cross-functional projects
* Ask HR about internal mobility programs
* Have coffee chats with people in other departments",1,1759812586.0,u_enhanceresume,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1o05epg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1o05epg/embracing_our_dark_feminine_or_how_perimenopause/,"Embracing our Dark Feminine: or, how Perimenopause changes our brains","I have been wanting to post something in here about the emotional and psychological impact that our shifting hormones have, and how this can unlock repressed traumas and cause suppressed emotions to rise to the surface, but I haven’t had been able to find the right words. Something to help us all feel like we’re not going insane; that everything we’re feeling during this transition is valid.

Luckily, the amazing Lindsey Lockett (iamlindseylockett on Instagram) shared a post that has everything I’ve been wanting to say and more. I’m going to paste her words here, because I think that they will resonate with at least some of the people in this group.

——-

Many women learn early in life to survive by over-regulating (people-pleasing, chronic agreement, numbing, perfectionism, and suppressing their urges, words, desires, sexuality). Calming hormones like estrogen + progesterone function as internal biochemical regulators, helping them sustain these coping strategies. As these hormones naturally decline in midlife, the entire system loses that hormonal support - and with it, the ability to maintain repression without consequence. The consequence? Repressed / suppressed stuff can't be silence so easily, so it starts coming out, leading many women to wonder, ""Who the f*ck am I???”

Thanks to Christianity, Islam, & other feminine-oppressing religions, global capitalism, and patriarchy, the ""official face"" of the feminine is the pure maiden, the patient & submissive wife, the obedient & impressive daughter, the nurturing & self-sacrificing mother. While those qualities certainly are expressions of the feminine, *they are not the only acceptable expressions of the feminine* - of embodied authenticity in the female body.

The feminine also contains dark expression: rage, chaos, death, eros, & transformation. Feminine-oppressing religions in particular (which 100% influence conditioning & culture whether you believe in the religion or not) exiled those expressions & labeled them ""evil"" - the devil, the witch, the whore, the loose woman, the heretic.

When these dark expressions are repressed, they don't disappear. They lie waiting in the body. If our mothers & grandmothers didn't integrate their dark feminine, that repression lives in our lineages. Eventually, the rage, chaos, eros, death, & transformation rise up with force in a way that our biochemical buffers can no longer protect us or others from.

Basically, the hormonal restraints come off - making it next to impossible for us to continue hiding, pretending, over-functioning, pleasing, & calibrating around others' needs. The body says, ""No more!"" & the desires, urges, feelings, & needs we carefully managed internally for decades come out in full force.

That's the dark feminine refusing to be exiled any longer.

This is why we see a surge of women in their late 30s to 50s leaving marriages and careers, leaving the identity of the homemaker & mother, refusing to continue over-functioning, and finding the rage in their voices for the first time. It's a rite of passage in to more embodied authenticity - where what we were praised for no longer works, and what was forbidden from us is what we actually need.

Conditioning that wants pure, docile, quiet, over-functioning people-pleasers rewards only those behaviors. We were praised for our ""light"" traits, so our ""dark"" traits were never allowed to develop in safe, conscious ways. When the hormonal buffers come off and the ""dark"" surfaces, it can feel dangerous, terrifying, crazy, and liberating.

Then, when women discover trauma & nervous system ""regulation"", they begin to unravel some of their conditioning. They desire authenticity more than anything - to finally express themselves in a world that limited their expression.

**But, Sugar, the embodiment of your authenticity is not possible without the exploration of the ""dark"".**

Your body cannot hold patience, docility, and over-functioning forever. Your biology itself is demanding integration of your ""dark"".

Your biology will no longer allow you to sustain the ""light"" feminine traits - and not because you're failing or crazy or ""unhealed""’ When the raw material of your shadow shows up - irritability, anger, dissatisfaction with unequal marriage, grief over decades of self-betrayal and over-functioning, it's a reckoning and a rite of passage into the most embodied, authentic version of you you've ever been.

When the exiled ""dark"" is finally let out of its cage, it can be destructive — this is why you want to burn your life/marriage/job down. But, it isn't only destruction. It's also rage that clarifies, chaos that creates, grief that initiates, lust that enlivens, & the composting of your old, former “light-only"" identities.

It is absolutely normal and ok if you do not know how to hold, contain, or metabolize this shift in your being. It is normal and ok if you are terrified of being seen in your ""dark"". You are not weak or lost, but you are entering terrain (or already in it) that your mothers and our culture has not prepared you for nor accepted nor allowed.

What's happening in your body, your nervous system, your hormones, and your psyche is a psychic upheaval. No one showed us how to become more - louder, hungrier, sexier, bolder - without shaming us, exiling us, or pathologizing us. The world doesn't offer care or space for women outgrowing their obedience.

———

To this I add, The world doesn’t offer this, so we create it for ourselves. In the online spaces like Reddit and Discord, and in physical spaces like yoga classes, coffee shops, book clubs, paint nights…wherever women gather in authenticity, that’s where we hold space for ourselves and for each other.

1o05e83,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1o05e83/chapter_3_masks_in_daylight/,Chapter 3 – Masks in Daylight,"Sunlight spilled across the marble floors of the estate, harsh and unforgiving. Minerva stood before the mirror as Elizabeth adjusted the cuff of her tailored jacket, every seam perfect, every trace of exhaustion hidden beneath careful layers. Only the faint tightness around her eyes betrayed the night before.

Elizabeth stepped back, appraising her work like a painter critiquing a canvas.
“Acceptable. If you avoid collapsing face-first into the canapé tray, I daresay no one will suspect you’ve been gallivanting through warehouses at ungodly hours.”

Minerva smirked faintly. “That’s your polite way of saying I look alive enough.”

Elizabeth’s eyebrow arched with surgical precision. “Alive is a generous description. Presentable will suffice.”

In the town car gliding through the city streets, polished black and silent, the skyline sliding past like a parade of distant, indifferent lives. Minerva’s eyes tracked the motion outside the window, the sunlight reflecting off glass towers, the hum of traffic far below. Her thoughts drifted, unbidden.

A smile tugged at a memory: dust-choked roads, the low growl of a military vehicle, the camaraderie of her squad huddled close against the hum of engines and the desert wind whipping across their faces. Laughter mixed with radio static, shouted commands, the small victories and small losses that stitched together days of danger.

Elizabeth’s voice broke the reverie. “Miss Filleas?” Her tone was calm but firm, cutting through the haze.

Minerva blinked, the memory dissolving. “I’m okay,” she said softly, offering the faintest nod.

The car slowed, the gleam of the estate’s marble driveway rising into view. Elizabeth parked, then hopped out and went to Minerva’s side, tone dry as champagne as she opens Minerva's door.
“Come along, Miss Filleas. Time for the heiress to grace the stage.”

Minerva nodded, adjusting the jacket Elizabeth had so meticulously fitted. She rose with the quiet confidence of someone accustomed to command, stepping onto the polished stone as the sunlight caught her silhouette.

At the entrance, her mother waited, elegance incarnate, a warm smile masking the same expectation that weighed on Minerva every day.

“Minerva,” her mother said, hand brushing lightly over her daughter’s arm. “You look marvelous. Now, remember to mingle.”

Minerva allowed herself a small, polite smile. “Of course, Mother.”

Together, they crossed the threshold, entering the glittering ballroom. Crystal chandeliers hung like frozen stars, casting light over the sea of gowns and suits. The scent of perfume and polished wood mingled with the faint tang of champagne. Minerva’s guard rose instantly, every muscle tuned to alertness beneath the mask of a socialite.

Elizabeth trailed slightly behind, watchful, a shadow of calm in a room full of light and noise.

And then Minerva heard it.

“…shipment’s delayed again,” a silver-haired man muttered to his associate near the buffet. “But the payments cleared. They’ll find another port, they always do.”

Her pulse ticked higher. Shipment. The same word she had pulled from a terrified smuggler’s lips only hours ago. The world of marble and crystal blurred for a moment with the warehouse shadows, as if the two spheres she lived in had collided.

Elizabeth’s voice slid smoothly into her ear. “Careful. Your smile’s slipping.”

Minerva forced her lips into a polite curve, even as her jaw clenched. She turned, lifting a flute of champagne from a passing tray — the kind Elizabeth had quietly ensured was sparkling water dressed in bubbles. To the crowd it looked elegant, celebratory. To Minerva, it was armor, a way to blend without ever lowering her guard.

Her father approached, his hand warm on her shoulder. “Minerva, there’s someone I’d like you to meet.” His tone was genial, but his eyes sharpened with unspoken command. Play your part. “He’s an old friend of mine.”

He guided her through the tangle of gowns and tuxedos, his presence clearing a path without effort. Minerva’s smile sharpened into something polite but hollow, her body moving while her mind churned.

The crowd parted, and there he was. A face she knew not from social circles or family stories, but from dossiers and field reports. His name sat high on the Special Forces bingo book — dangerous, untouchable.

Suddenly, the hum of the ballroom faded. The scent of burnt coffee and gun oil clawed at her memory, pulling her back to a cold briefing room. Fluorescent lights buzzed faintly over maps, dossiers, and half-empty mugs.

“Pay attention to this one,” Lieutenant Harker said, sliding a photo across the table. His scarred hand lingered at the edge of the glossy paper, eyes sharp and unyielding.

Minerva leaned forward. The man in the photo stared back at her — eyes like stone, a mouth set in the permanent line of a predator. The same face now smiling politely across a ballroom decades and worlds apart.

“He doesn’t just complete missions,” Harker continued, voice low and certain. “He cleans house. Entire units vanish when he’s on the field. If you see him, don’t engage. Survive. That’s your only objective.”

The paper trembled in her hands, and for a moment, she felt the cold weight of inevitability: she was staring at a ghost who walked among the living.

And now, that ghost was shaking hands with her father.

Her pulse hammered, but she stayed frozen. Tonight, she wasn’t a soldier. She was her father’s daughter.",1,1759812044.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
1o05do1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1o05do1/day_8_25f_general_tips_foods_i_do_and_dont/,"Day 8 25F. General tips, foods I do and don't recommend","Hey all, end of day 8 here (I had my surgery last Monday, Sept 29th). I feel like I'm doing AMAZING and wanted to share what that looks and feels like, and some of my tips. 

Medication: I'm completely off everything - I took my last Percocet several days ago and my last acetaminophen two nights ago. I babied myself with the medication and allowed myself to take it whenever I remotely wanted to, and feel no need to take anything anymore. 

What I'm doing: I successfully went couch shopping on Sunday at two different stores, talking to salespeople, getting up and down from a ton of couches, ate fro-yo, went to Panera for dinner. Kind of a big day! Minimal pain, no problems. My voice is definitely weird but not weird enough that anyone gives you a funny look. I can push for an almost-normal voice when I want to. 

Disclaimer that I'm not a doctor, just some lady who had a tonsillectomy, so, not medical advice. I'm not sponsored or anything by any brand/product mentioned here either. 

  
Some tips: 

1. When you can handle drinking water pretty well, drink water as a passenger in the car. I think a number of my scabs came off specifically during this scenario. Because the car is moving, braking, going over bumps, etc., it keeps changing how you swallow and the exact path the water takes down your throat. Then, because the water is taking new paths and getting jerked around by your body in the car, it helps tug scabs off of areas it doesn't normally go over. 
2. Order Boost Very High Calorie shakes, or a nutritional equivalent. I don't really handle hunger well and very early on, I was struggling bad because I wasn't getting the calories or nutrition I need. You also probably aren't getting nearly what you need from the applesauce/soup/popsicles/etc that you can handle. Help your body, give it the real calories and nutrients it needs. And water them down, they are super thick. 
3. Ice on your jaw/neck! I loved my cheap heat/ice wrap for my neck. (Here's the one I got: Bodyprox Face ice Pack for Jaw,... [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GX69H3W?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GX69H3W?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share). You can heat it or freeze it.) Wrapping ice packs in a towel is cool too, works great, but the wrap just gives you a little more mobility. I personally am extremely sensitive to cold so I needed to wrap the wrap in an extra towel but I don't think most people need that. 
4. If you get coughing fits, drink warm water. Not hot! Warm like you forgot about your coffee for 20 minutes, like you'd serve a toddler. For my microwave, that's usually water in a mug heated for 45s-1min. 
5. Go for walks as much as you can handle it. Even if they're super short, even if they're super slow. You get blood moving and you'll sleep better. 

Some less-commonly mentioned foods on here that were great for me: 

   1. Pulled pork/chicken. No BBQ sauce, since acid and spice can irritate. I used Chick-fil-A sauce when I cared enough to want more flavor. I'm not usually a meat person but this was very reviving. 
   2. Pastina. 4 ingredients: chicken stock, acini di pepe pasta (tiny like couscous), butter, parm. Optionally an egg for protein. Gets soft and mushy, and it's small, high-calorie, and very comforting. 
   3. Ditalini pasta - the pieces are so small that you can easily get them in your mouth and chew them. I did this with sausage and tomato sauce (don't do this, it stings) - just pick another sauce. 
   4. Mac and cheese - with a hard element. When you can just start to handle something firmer than mac and cheese on its own, get it with something hard in/on it. I had the bacon mac and cheese from Panera, and the bacon is a little on the hard/dry side, but it was a good transition food. Breadcrumbs could be a decent option too. 
   5. Soaked bread: I really wanted bread but couldn't handle the crusts. I had a baguette, pulled out the soft middle, soaked the crust in soup for a minute or so. Not enough to disintegrate, but enough that I could chew and swallow without fear of ripping a scab. 
   6. Panera in general is great here just because it has a lot of soups. 
   7. Sweet iced tea! Not as acidic as lemonade, bright and refreshing. 
   8. Spoonful of peanut butter (optionally with banana). High-calorie, melts in your mouth if you just let it sit. 

Foods I DIDN'T like: 

1. Popsicles. I know this is unusual but I found this level of cold extremely uncomfortable. I also have sensitive teeth, and trying to protect my teeth with a barely-functioning tongue doesn't work that well. I think I've eaten 3 and only ate two of them because my boyfriend made me. 
2. Applesauce. Caveat that mine is homemade, so might be more acidic than storebought. On Day 8 and this stuff still stings from the acids in the apple. 
3. Pudding. Dairy makes you create more mucus, do not like, gross. 
4. Jello. I tolerated this since at the beginning it was one of the only things I could handle but in my opinion it's still pretty firm. If you make it at home I would try using more water so it has a runnier texture. 
5. Soup. Not very good when lukewarm. I didn't tolerate hot well for a week, so preferred mac and cheese since it's better than soup when lukewarm. ",1,1759811992.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

We stayed at the Hyatt Regency since Hyatts are nice enough and we wanted restaurants & bars within walking distance. We had a LOT of fun and really liked the places we patronized (Bruhaven, Brit's pub, Sushi Train to name a few) and the sights (including Minnehaha falls). But a lot of the walks to and from the hotel felt very... iffy.

And I want to say that we lived in downtown Chicago (which is in no way perfect or devoid of crime or seedy areas) for maaaaaaany years. This isn't a criticism or comparison. I'm just mentioning this to emphasize that I'm not an anti-city suburbanite complaining about general city issues.

But I don't think I've ever felt as high-alert walking with my son down a city street. Even walking to get a coffee at 10am on a Saturday. A lot of people tweaking out or passed out on the sidewalk, or yelling profanities at anyone that walked by. We saw multiple fights on the way to coffee.

Is there better area for us to stay next time that also isn't pure tourist-trap? 

We plan to come back and stay downtown. We have several friends near the cities (in various suburbs) but they don't often actually go downtown often, so they didn't have much useful advice.

I hope this doesn't come off as criticism, we were just surprised by the area and we didn't even consider it as a possibility. ",23,1759811742.0,Minneapolis,54,0.67,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1o05a02,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRePost/comments/1o05a02/the_ultimate_guide_to_novelty_diplomas_from/,The Ultimate Guide to Novelty Diplomas: From Personal Keepsakes to Perfect Gifts,"Let's be honest, most of us don't spend our days thinking about diplomas. They’re the kind of thing that gets tossed in a folder or stored in a dusty tube somewhere, forgotten until you need it for a job application or a background check. But what if a diploma could be more than just an official document? What if it could be a source of joy, a piece of personal history, or the most thoughtful gift you ever give?

That’s the wonderful world of novelty diplomas. They’re not about forging credentials; they’re about celebrating moments. Think of them as highly personalized pieces of art that just happen to look incredibly official and impressive. So, who are these for? Well, just about anyone.

First, there’s the personal keepsake. Maybe your dog ate your actual high school diploma. It happens more than you’d think. Or perhaps you want a beautiful display copy for your office wall, but you’re too nervous to take the original out of its safe deposit box. A high-quality novelty diplomas replica solves that perfectly. It looks and feels so real, with its raised seals and textured paper, that you’ll be the only one who knows it’s a stand-in. It’s for your own sense of pride and accomplishment, a daily reminder of a goal you achieved.

Then there’s the gift angle. This is where it gets really fun. Imagine a husband who always jokes about getting his ""Ph.D. in Couch Potato Studies."" For his birthday, you could have a beautifully crafted novelty diplomas created with that very title, his name, and a hilarious major. It’s a gift that shows you listen and have a great sense of humor. It’s a conversation starter that will have everyone laughing when they see it framed in the game room.

They’re also perfect for retirement parties. That colleague who’s been the heart of the office for 40 years? Present them with a ""Doctorate in Office Gossip"" or a ""Master of Coffee Brewing."" It’s a unique, personal tribute that beats a standard plaque any day. The key is the quality, though. A flimsy piece of paper from a random website won’t have the same effect. The best novelty diplomas have a weight to them, a feel of authenticity that makes the gesture feel sincere and well-considered, even if the subject is all in good fun.

For graduates, a novelty diplomas can be a fantastic placeholder. Let's face it, many universities take months to mail out the real thing. Giving a graduate a stunning replica on their graduation day gives them something tangible to hold and display immediately, while they wait for the official one to arrive. It shows you’re thinking a step ahead.

Ultimately, that’s what these custom documents are all about. They’re not about deception; they’re about connection. They connect us to our own memories in a beautiful way, and they help us connect with others through laughter and thoughtful, one-of-a-kind gifts. It’s about honoring the real milestones with a touch of personal flair, or just bringing a smile to someone’s face. In a world full of generic presents and forgotten paperwork, a well-made novelty diplomas stands out as something truly special.",1,1759811657.0,RedditRePost,0,1.0,False

1o056ja,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o056ja,Do you believe being surrounded by the right people is the best hack for ultimate growth?,"Sabi nila your circle determines your ceiling.

Everything shifted when I found mentors who were 10x my level.

Their ""normal"" became my new baseline.  
Their problems became my new targets.  
Their thinking became my new standard.

Environment is stronger than willpower.

Here are 6 ways to upgrade your circle today:

# 1.Join Communities of High-Performers

Seek environments where excellence is the minimum standard, not the exception.

I've found that when you're the least accomplished person in the room, your growth accelerates exponentially.

High-performance communities create natural accountability that no app or system can replicate.

# 2. Attend Events Where Your Heroes Gather

The magic rarely happens during the presentations, it's in the lobby conversations, the dinners after, the unexpected connections.

I met one of my most influential mentors not during his keynote, but while waiting for coffee at an event I almost didn't attend.

Proximity creates possibility.

# 3. Create Value Before Asking

The moment you shift from ""what can I get?"" to ""what can I give?"" everything changes.

I spent six months helping others in my industry before ever asking for anything in return.

This approach built a reservoir of goodwill that continues to overflow years later.

# 4. Share Your Work Publicly

Building in public isn't just about transparency, it's about signaling.

When you openly share your journey, values, and systems, you naturally attract aligned people while filtering out those who don't resonate.

My most valuable relationships began when someone reached out after seeing something I'd shared.

# 5. Be Genuinely Curious

Curiosity is the hidden superpower in relationship-building.

I've found that asking thoughtful questions and truly listening creates deeper connections than any amount of impressive talking.

People remember the person who made them feel understood, not the one who tried to sound intelligent.

# 6. Invest in Relationships

The relationships that transformed my business weren't built over a single coffee meeting, they developed through consistent investment over time.

I block time every week specifically for relationship nurturing, treating it with the same importance as any business-critical activity.

I've seen this play out over and over with founders in our community. When they upgrade their circle, their business transforms almost automatically.

Your network isn't just your net worth. It's your thinking, your standards, your opportunities, your energy, and ultimately, your future.

Fuck off depression.,"Ten years ago this Christmas,  I lost my most important person to a massive brain stem stroke.  She was only 44 and had been my best friend for 25 years. 
I lost so many things when she died.  I lost all the best parts of me. I lost my ability to write, and I had just had my first thing published.  I lost my love of music. To me music was like air and food.  It fed me. 

I've spent a decade running to the walk in to cry,  especially at Christmas because the stroke that took her happened on Christmas eve/morning.I already didn't care for the season, but I tolerated it, because it was her favorite holiday and seeing her geek out over pretty lights made me smile,  but after she died,  I fucking despised it.

I've been at my current job now for 9 months. It is the most cohesive crew I've ever had the pleasure to work with.  It is the cleanest kitchen I've ever been in. My EC and higher ups are all (but one) good bosses. My coworkers are amazing and come from all walks of life. 
There are are always three stations playing music and I started to enjoy it. 
We get service bucks to spend in the ""company store"" and I just redeemed a bunch of them to get a tablet and a nice Sony portable speaker. 

I just spent three hours building some playlists and making my ears bleed.
I'm so grateful I was bounced from my last job,  with a boss who showed me what NOT to be. I'm so grateful for these people who entered my life and have helped without even knowing, to make me find one of the parts of me that I thought had died with Mel(issa). Maybe she was just hiding. 

Two years ago, I started trying to do Christmas again,  even if it was to just go look at pretty lights,  but it made me cry. Last year I decided to do Christmas MY WAY, so I start my holiday on October 15th, because I had a melt down in the grocery store on that day in 2019 when I went to get cold medicine. When I walked in the grocery store, and was hit with Christmas music and decorations and I got angry that I couldn't even make it to my birthday in late October before Christmas was shoved down my throat.  I now do ""El día de los muertos antes de navidad"" (The day of the dead before Christmas) My 14"" fake tree goes on my table on the 15th of this month and stays up till February 8th, the day she died. It is adorned with all things that are her. Beneath it,  is her flask,  a coffee cup, and a glass pipe for all the wake and bake weekend calls we had after she moved out of state. 

Maybe it's not a big deal,  but something is different,  and I'm happy for the bleeding ears and the feelings I was having,  being in the music again. 
I hope everyone is able to find their path to some kind of solace in the face of fucked up mental health. 

I'm not healed,  but something woke up and something got better. 
I'm just grateful,  for the moment anyway. 
Sick n Sin Mel. You'll always be my best friend.  Death has never stopped that.  I miss you every day. I'll cook for you again someday.

Im aware I can make a tea concentrate for lattes but I have a coffee grinder attachment for my blender and a mortar and pestle. Between the 2 I think I can make a sufficiently fine powder. 

But will it taste the same? Idk if the difference between loose leaf and powdered involves any additional steps. ",4,1759810809.0,tea,1,1.0,False
