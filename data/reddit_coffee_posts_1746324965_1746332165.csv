So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

* It says that you're not supposed to use cooking appliances in your room, but does this mean you can store them (i'm thinking a kettle or coffee machine) in your room and take them out to use in a common area/kitchen?
* Apparently there's a small lockable cupboard that needs you to provide your own lock, how big is this cupboard? (pictures would be great!!)
* In the restricted items section it mentions that you can't bring large stereos or DJ equipment (a shame cause i got a flx4 a couple months ago and was planning to practice with it thru university), but what really counts as a ""large stereo""?

1kea3yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fwdtrek/comments/1kea3yt/decoding_the_clutch_whats_actually_going_on_in/,**Decoding the Clutch: What's Actually Going On In There?**,"Okay, buckle up, buttercups, because we're diving headfirst into the heart of your motorcycle – the clutch! Think of it as the ultimate gatekeeper, deciding when your engine's power gets to play with the wheels. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. It's a whole universe of friction plates, springs, and levers just begging to be understood. So, grab a coffee (or something stronger, no judgement here) and let's unravel this mechanical marvel!

**Pro-Tip Power-Ups:**

*   **Feather Like a Boss:** Learn to *feather* that clutch, people! It's the difference between smooth starts and looking like you're trying to wrestle a wild badger off the bike. Gentle is the key.
*   **Listen to Your Bike:** That clutch lever isn't just for show. Feel it, listen to the engine note. A little practice and you'll be able to diagnose problems before they leave you stranded.
*   **Fresh Oil, Happy Clutch:** Use the right oil, and change it regularly. Clutch performance is massively affected by the oil quality. Don't be a cheapskate on this one, trust me.

Alright, picture this: a stack of plates, like a metallic pancake breakfast. These are your clutch plates, and they come in two delicious flavors:

*   **Friction Plates:** These guys are covered in a special material (friction material, duh!) designed to create grip. They are splined to the clutch basket
*   **Steel Plates:** These are smooth steel or aluminum discs that sit between the friction plates. They are splined to the central hub.

Normally, these plates are pressed tightly together by a bunch of springs. This locks the engine's power to the transmission. Now, when you pull that clutch lever, you're essentially telling the springs to take a chill pill. This separates the plates, breaks the power connection and lets you shift gears, stop, or do wheelies (responsibly, of course).

## **Types of Motorcycle Clutches: Wet vs. Dry (and Why You Should Care)**

Now, here's where things get a little saucy. Clutches come in two main varieties:

*   **Wet Clutches:** This is the most common type, found in the majority of bikes. ""Wet"" because the clutch plates are bathed in engine oil. This keeps things cool, lubricated, and quiet. Bonus? They tend to last longer.
*   **Dry Clutches:** These are the rebels of the clutch world, found in some performance bikes (think Ducatis!). They operate outside the engine oil, which means they can be lighter and offer a slightly more direct feel. The trade-off? They're noisier, can wear out faster, and can be a bit…temperamental.
   *   *Quick note on slipper clutches* - Slipper clutches help mitigate the issue of 'engine braking', where the engine wants to slow the rear wheel more rapidly than is ideal. These are popular on performance bikes and can make downshifting much smoother.

## **Troubleshooting Common Clutch Conundrums**

So, your clutch is acting up? Don't panic! Here are a few common issues and what they might mean:

*   **Clutch Slipping:** This is when your engine revs up, but your bike doesn't accelerate as quickly as it should. It feels like you're losing power. Causes can include worn-out clutch plates, oil contamination, or a poorly adjusted clutch cable.
*   **Clutch Drag:** This is when the clutch doesn't fully disengage when you pull the lever. It makes shifting difficult and can cause the bike to creep forward even with the clutch pulled in. The cause is often a cable issue.
*   **Hard to Find Neutral:** Another symptom of clutch drag or a bad cable adjustment.

## **DIY Clutch Maintenance: Getting Your Hands Dirty**

While some clutch repairs are best left to the pros, there are a few things you can tackle yourself:

*   **Adjusting the Clutch Cable:** This is clutch maintenance 101. A properly adjusted clutch cable ensures that the clutch engages and disengages smoothly. Consult your owner's manual for the correct procedure, but it usually involves adjusting the free play at the lever.
*   **Changing the Clutch Fluid (If Applicable):** Some bikes use a hydraulic clutch system, which requires regular fluid changes. Think of it like brake fluid.
*   **Checking the Clutch Plates (For the Brave):** If you're feeling adventurous, you can inspect your clutch plates for wear. This involves removing the clutch cover and disassembling the clutch assembly. But be warned: it can be messy and requires a decent amount of mechanical skill. If you're not confident, leave it to a professional.",1,1746327968.0,u_fwdtrek,0,1.0,False

We've both endured moving during covid and having covid, grief of many loved ones passing and our own health issues. Health issues stayed the same /increased and moving into a house from an apt bills doubled. My husband had his gallbladder removed before our move. He has a lot of undiagnosed medical issues. Such as he may need his altenoids (spelling ?) removed. He has a broken file from a root canal that may require a costly surgery to fix. He's taking monthly allergy injections as before knowing those other things we thought it was all sinus block from allergies. That being said he says it's worse at night, does anyone know why that would be? I'm wondering if he has sleep apnea or something completely different from those other issues /assumptions. I've tried to be helpful and supportive but I'm having a hard time also. I work nearly full time plus go to college consistently and he works one day a week and goes to college about one class every other semester. We had more money coming in previously as I was a caregiver and got paid for it. So he's managed his one day a week (and also a seasonal 4-6mo a year job from home ,the one day a week job is physical )but I lost my loved one and that's effected my mental health as well as our finances from caregiving which made up from his lack of hours. We've both lost insurance when he went from full time to one day. I had it on mine but didn't make enough hours at the main job to keep it (my care giving and his seasonal jobs don't provide insurance )I still do caregiving as a job job not for a relative but it's random when needed. I had an ankle injury year (torn ligament and ruptured tendons) this put me out of work over two months as my main job is very physical and I couldn't walk at all during most of thsy time. It happened on the last day of his seasonal work and his continued one day a week at the main job. All of our accounts went into the negatives and it was very stressful to the point we couldn't even buy a coffee at one point if we wanted to. We consolidated our debt since we couldn't pay the credit cards directly. I got back to work things balanced out just making it each month and now a year later and the seasonal job just ended in late February and we are back to already missing one mortgage payment since. He's not applying to many jobs and insists on getting a work from home job but hasn't applied to many or got hired. I told him about a legit company my friend did for work from home work and he didn't apply..found a doctors office hiring for a sit down reception in our town cause commuting is another no for him and he didn't even look at the listing. I'm super defeated and exhausted. Even if I work more it won't be enough. I can't support us both in this economy and I have no where else to go my families house wouldn't be suitable for me to move back into and my name is still on all our bills even if I distanced myself..he has borrowed or got given 2k from a younger relative 2 yrs ago but it seems like it only bothers me we can't pay him back and how long it's been. We also owe my mom for car parts. To pay the mortgage this month I came up with about two thirds of it with my income. The rest he paid with his four days of work and dipping into $300 we had saved towards  for something important for his elderly father. He has no plans to start work and besides the health issues listed above (which I dont think should stop him from working ?) he had no reason not to work. He is an avid gamer so his time is spent in one room by himself. His only friends are mainly gamers so thats his social life. When we worked full time together same job we went out with our friends after work. Now we don't even go out together and because he says he feels worse at night he doesn't come to bed either. He stays up (used to be 1-4 am but now  he stays up until after I leave at 5am  for my shifts I'm not sure when he goes to bed but more like 530-8am) and he wakes 1pm.to 3pm. So my nights are spent alone chatting to friends, reading or binging shows when I'm home and when I get up to leave for work he's on his computer and almost ready for bed for the day meanwhile I'm supporting us with being at my wits end with an ankle that's still busted up (hurts and gives issues still ) and he has no communication , considerstion or plans to fix his health issues , our financial problem or our relationship. Tonight I reached out to the younger relative ""we owe"" money to because he's like a brother to him and I'm hoping he can help with advice or talking to him but so far I just said I'd like to talk to him soon I didn't open it up and I'm nervous to spill personal stuff but it's better than talking to his aunt and my family doesn't interfere. What should I be doing? He won't talk to me and has nothing to say when I ask about jobs mainly shuts down or ""mhm"" ok or I'll go look now. But back in 2021 during some of my grief and mental health super lows  I called out from the main job so much (had money coming in from caregiving jobs ) but was at risk of losing the main job and he sat down like I was a child and almost demanded I get back to work or we'd be homeless (I was in bed everyday with severe anxiety and depression from so much pressure ) and now I'm just supposed to be fine when he's the one doing it although he was only employed one day a week when he made the ultimatum to me but was going in for ot cause it was summer.

**Let’s play a game.**

Imagine you're an independent journalist, musician, coder, or quirky birdhouse influencer. You spend your days creating, hustling, and maybe even saving the internet one passionate post at a time. And suddenly—*boom*—someone loves your work and wants to donate.

But wait. Before that precious $10 hits your pocket, it’s gotta zigzag through a spaghetti mess of payment processors. PayPal takes a slice. Stripe nibbles. The bank slurps the rest. After fees, delays, and ""compliance reviews,"" you’re lucky if you can afford half a cup of fancy coffee.

**Enter: the Bitcoin Donate Button.**

Now available from the delightful rebels at [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/), this little digital widget is here to do one thing and do it brilliantly: cut out the meddling middlemen and let you receive Bitcoin donations directly—fast, borderless, and censorship-resistant.

Let’s unpack this beautiful rebellion in 1,000-ish words of cheeky wit, digital empowerment, and possibly the best crypto love story never told.

# The Middleman: Friend or Foe?

We’ve been told middlemen are necessary. That they “protect” us from fraud, help us manage risk, and ensure a “smooth user experience.” But let’s be real—they’re just really good at skimming off the top while pretending to offer value.

Middlemen are the digital toll collectors of the internet economy. You know, those guys who show up when you're just trying to share a music track or raise funds for your podcast about conspiracy theories and coffee shops. Suddenly, there’s a platform demanding 2.9% plus 30 cents, a review delay, or even worse—an account freeze due to ""suspicious activity."" (Spoiler alert: it was your friend in Argentina trying to donate $3.)

With Bitcoin, none of that matters. It doesn’t ask who you are, where you're from, or whether your PayPal account is ""verified."" It’s peer-to-peer. Borderless. Instant. And gloriously out of reach of third-party meddling.

Now, all you need is a donate button powered by—say it with us—**Bitcoin.**

# What Is This Magical Donate Button?

It’s a beautifully simple, plug-and-play button that you can drop onto your site, blog, project page, or livestream like hot sauce on a burrito. It creates a clickable QR code or Bitcoin address where your adoring fans (or rich uncles) can send Bitcoin directly to you.

No logins. No paperwork. No ""terms of service"" nonsense.

Just sweet, sweet sats flowing from one digital wallet to another—yours.

You can try it right now, even if your tech skills rank somewhere between ""grandma learning WhatsApp"" and ""I once reset a router.""

Here’s the magic link:  
👉 [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/)

# Why You’ll Love It (and Why Your Future Self Will Thank You)

# 🔒 Sovereignty over Censorship

Tired of tip jars that come with terms and conditions longer than the Iliad? Our donate button doesn’t care what your blog is about. Whether you're teaching permaculture, writing sci-fi fan fiction, or streaming late-night coding sessions, this button doesn’t judge. It just works.

# 🌎 Global Donations, No Boundaries

Your fans in Nairobi, Buenos Aires, or Kyoto can now send you value instantly. Bitcoin doesn’t believe in borders, exchange rates, or international wire transfer fees. It’s like the universal translator of generosity.

# ⏱️ Real-Time Gratitude

Donations hit your wallet fast—no “pending” screens or “please allow 3-5 business days.” When someone hits that button, your wallet goes *cha-ching* and your heart does a little happy dance.

# 💸 Zero Fees. Maximum Feels.

Okay, technically there’s the Bitcoin network fee (paid by the sender), but there’s no middleman siphoning off your hard-earned donations. You keep what you earn. Radical, right?

# Who’s It For?

* **Content Creators**: Musicians, YouTubers, Twitch streamers, TikTok theorists—get paid for your genius without giving 10% to some mega-corp.
* **Developers**: Working on open-source tools or side projects? Let the community chip in with sats, not just GitHub stars.
* **Activists & Journalists**: Speak truth to power without worrying if your bank will block your next crowdfund.
* **Memers & Mischief Makers**: Get rewarded in Bitcoin for your dankest memes. It’s only fair.

Basically, if you’ve got an audience and a dream, this button is your crypto-powered tip jar of justice.

# But… Is It Easy?

Absolutely. We made it grandma-proof.

Here’s how it works:

1. Go to [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/)
2. Enter your Bitcoin address (from any wallet you control).
3. Customize your button. Add a message like “Support My Journey” or “Feed the Coffee Monster.”
4. Copy the HTML code.
5. Paste it into your site, blog, Substack, Notion page, or wherever you hang out online.

Done. Live. Ready for magic.

No APIs. No OAuth. No tech headaches. It’s as easy as copy, paste, and prosper.

# But What About Taxes, Anonymity, and Compliance?

Alright, legal eagle, we hear you.

* **Anonymity**: You *can* stay pseudonymous if you want. That’s the beauty of Bitcoin. Just don’t post your home address right next to your donation button.
* **Taxes**: In most jurisdictions, donations are taxable if you’re receiving them for work or projects. Talk to your accountant. Or, at the very least, your spreadsheet.
* **Compliance**: This isn’t a money-laundering tool. It’s a gratitude enhancer. Use it responsibly. Be cool.

# The Bigger Picture: Decentralized Generosity

This isn’t just about tech. It’s about values.

In a world of deplatforming, gatekeeping, and algorithmic nonsense, we believe people should be able to support each other directly. No friction. No fuss. No suits taking their cut.

The Bitcoin Donate Button is a small, subversive act of financial independence. It says:

""I see you. I appreciate you. And I’d rather give my Bitcoin to YOU than to another tech monopoly.""

That’s powerful.

That’s the future.

And it starts right now—on your website, with a few lines of code and a whole lot of freedom.

# Ready to Unleash the Sats?

Let’s recap:

* No middleman.
* No fees.
* No gatekeepers.
* Yes Bitcoin.
* Yes instant donations.
* Yes to YOU being in control.

All it takes is one little button. Try it today at

Mandy walked out of the cabin with the hand pulling the end table behind her.

She put the end table in front of her and placed all her potions on the table. Practically beaming at the possibility of getting more research on her potions.

And apologies in advance if this post turns out to be an obnoxious length. However, it is only because I will try to be as thorough as possible with details and context.

Stats and context:

Male, 33, 6'1, 185-195 lbs (and haven't moved from this range in years), caucasian, do not drink but did socially from age 21-27 and only occasional drink now, smoked socially for about 5 years mostly via ""bumming"" (no where near pack-year levels), vaped a few times. I've taken pantoprazole 40mg on and off over the years to manage my acid reflux. No other meds.

I'm also a military vet and have deployed to Afghanistan. No long term, immediate burn pit exposure, though I have been semi-close to them 3 or 4 times for periods of 20 minutes or less, if I had to estimate.

I run about 20 miles a week and in the gym 3 times a week, but otherwise I have had a pretty sedentary lifestyle in recent years due to university (kind of a forever student) and work.

And to be honest, this recent year has been one of the most stressful and anxiety ridden i've ever experienced, for a whole mix of professional, personal, and relationship reasons, and not sure how well I managed that stress and anxiety.

Primary issue:

Intermittent chest discomfort, a twitch or stitch-like feeling, light pinches, (left and right, sternum area and sometimes flanks). This is accompanied recently by air hunger, hoarseness/weak voice, sour, metallic taste in mouth, constantly inflamed and red tonsils and surrounding area in mouth, tickle in throat (I don't have a persistent cough, it's only in response to the tickle when I do cough), and a feeling like my diaphragm area is ever so subtly grating on the left side. When I take deep breaths in, my sternum area usually always clicks and pops, and my spine at the same level, sometimes clicks and pops. With the exception of chest discomfort which i've felt on and off throughout the years, all of the other symptoms basically appeared around 5-ish weeks ago, I think. Finally, my limbs, particularly my legs have felt pressurized and can see it in the veins, makes trying to sleep difficult, feels like restless legs. The left leg this happened in Nov. and the right leg more recently. I've been feeling head pressure recently as well, like I have a band around my head. Then also recently what I think are bone aches and random muscle aches, bowel irregularities, fatigue, and then brain fog like i've never experienced before. I also currently have a 4 week old still only partially healed burn on my hand, about an inch long and .5 inch wide. My diet the last 6 weeks has been insanely strict, and for drink water and matcha tea and occasionally a coffee, that's it.

I'm posting because i'm at all loss as to the direction I need to go next. The collection of symptoms are hard to ignore, but it's been difficult to continue to push for answers and direction.

Here are all the tests i've had done since July 2024 chasing this situation down, which at that time was very mild compared to recent developments:

\-July 2024, chest x ray, blood, and ECG - clear and normal

\- Nov 2024, throat and neck CT and blood - clear and normal (noted tops of lungs as ""predominantly clear""

\-Nov 2024, abdominal and pelvic MRI - clear, nothing remarkable.

\-Jan 2025, Nasal and throat endoscopy - nothing abnormal

\-April 2025, chest x ray and abdominal ultrasound - normal and clear; my WBC in my blood work here was two whole numbers lower than NOV, however still within ""normal"" range.

\-I also have an infected tooth that is schedule to be extracted this coming week. Said tooth was already refill August 2024.

\-I've also asked my PCP for an autoimmune blood panel, but hasn't responded yet.

\-I am supposed to have an endoscopy soon, but need cardio to clear me first, since i've been complaining of chest discomfort.

My anxiety about this has flatlined because at this point I just want to figure this out. I am concerned though about my throat and chest/lungs and head, to be honest. But all the recent imaging suggests I shouldn't be. I want to chalk this up to a mix of acid and silent reflex and Costochondritis, but i'm not ready to settle on that yet, especially given the weird stuff like fatigue and brain fog and dizziness. And my run today felt more difficult comparatively, because of chest tightness.

1ke9pzw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke9pzw,Help me find the perfect Mother’s Day Nespresso gift (and something for myself too 😅),"Hi everyone!

I’m on the hunt for the perfect Mother’s Day gift and I think Nespresso might be the answer — but I’m new to this world and would love your help!

A little background: I only drink instant Nescafe Gold decaf (please don’t judge lol). I’m strictly a latte person, always with almond or oat milk. I honestly just like the taste of that specific coffee in my lattes.

Now my mom? Total opposite. She’s a real coffee lover — grinds her beans fresh, uses filters and fancy little mesh things, and drinks only pure, strong coffee in tiny cups that smell like rocket fuel to me (in a good way, I think? lol). Sometimes she adds a spoon of heavy cream, but that’s it.

The issue is, lately she’s been way too busy in the mornings and doesn’t have time for her usual brewing ritual. I’ve noticed she’s been just pouring hot water over ground coffee in a cup, and let’s just say… cleaning out dried coffee sludge from those mugs every day is not my favorite thing.

So! I’m hoping to find a Nespresso machine that:
	•	Is super convenient and quick in the mornings.
	•	Has pods similar to Nescafe Gold decaf for me (ideally decaf options that work well with milk).
	•	Has blonde/light roast-style pods that taste good black for my mom — she actually liked my Nescafe Gold once, so maybe there’s hope!

Also, I tried browsing the Nespresso website but it keeps glitching (maybe because of the 30% off sale?), so I checked Walmart instead and these are the models they currently have available. Can any of these work for both our needs?

Available models:

	•	Nespresso New Vertuo Next 19-Bar, 1-Cup Black Espresso Machine

	•	Nespresso Vertuo Pop by De’Longhi Coffee and Espresso Maker with Coffee Tasting Set, Black

	•	Nespresso Vertuo Plus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De’Longhi, Black

	•	Nespresso By De’Longhi New Vertuo Next Premium Coffee and Espresso Maker in Chrome + Aeroccino3 Milk Frother (I don't need frother tbh 😅)

	•	Breville New Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe in Piano Black

	•	VertuoPlus New Coffee and Espresso Machine by De’Longhi, Limited Edition, Black Matte

	•	Nespresso Bundle: Vertuo Line POP Machine + Starbucks Sunsera Coffee Capsules

Would any of these be a good fit for a latte-lover (me) and a black coffee purist (my mom)? Should I be looking at Original line instead of Vertuo?

Thanks so much in advance — I’d love any tips on machines, pods, or even what NOT to buy!

P.s. I have my own nano foamer I'm pretty happy with, so I believe I don't need any kind of latte/frother attachment, just a machine and that is all 😅",2,1746326626.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

My boss and GM of course mentor me in a way as well, but I think their mindset is for me to have mentorship from outside of our direct team to not only get a new perspective, but to also get a more well-rounded mentorship if it comes from a leader that isn’t directly associated with me and my performance. I in theory agree with all of this but am a loss as to:

1. How to ask someone to be a mentor after having a coffee chat?
2. What do yall usually talk to your mentor about when you have your coffee chats and how often do you find yourself chatting with them?

Extra question: 
3. Anyone that’s had an official mentor that’s in a high position and have maintained the relationship for a long while - what other benefits have you seen from curating these types of mentor relationships

This seems to be more personal of a connection than your typical “networking/mentorship program” that many companies facilitate. So this could be a cool opportunity but also I’m just kind of nervous about how to start this, aside from the initial ask for a coffee chat. ",1,1746326180.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

I'm a pretty heavy coffee addict but the problem is that coffee makes my tummy rumble.

While I was writing my book I ordered an ice caramel macchiato and shortly after drinking it I began to pass a lot of gas

I was trying to hide it but I did the thing where I lifted my leg up like an animal to let it escape but in doing so the person sitting next to me threw up on her table. 

I gave her a concerned look as if I didn't just propell weaponized gas at her face, but I felt bad so I got up to go get her some paper towels, but while I was walking back I tried to let out another fart but everything inside me exploded out through my shorts and on the floor? I felt my body levitate for a quick second kinda like I was wearing a jetpack. Happened between the songs they play so I tried to play it off like it was the beginning of the next song by clapping but this just made everyone in the cafe look at me

I tried to smile and play it off like I didn't just propell shit out of my ass and have it explode on the floor of the cafe and but the woman who threw up had a horrified look on her face which i didnt understand because I was clapping. So next I tried to smile and wave but I tripped and landed in the streak of excrement which apparently was on one of the walls now.

At this point I went into fight or flight mode and ran out of the cafe.

I tried to go back the next day and apologize because I figured this kinda thing happens to everyone, but they have a picture of me from security footage laying in a pool of shit saying that I'm not welcome back? 

I'm thinking of suing the established because clearly something is wrong with the coffee? I don't know how I'm supposed to finish my manuscript now if I'm banned from my favorite cafe? I know everyone will tell me to lay off the coffee but I'm kinda addicted 😅

1ke9jly,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ke9jly/ocd_and_lovelimerance/,OCD and love/limerance,"This got really long. Probably way too detailed, but I need to finally tell SOMEBODY this shit. Sorry.


Context: I(M20s) have clinically diagnosed OCD, MDD, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety, all untreated. Probably undiagnosed autism and/or adhd. I've had multiple episodes of psychosis that health care just chock up to weed. Victim? of COCSA. Narcissistic mom, chronically depressed(and angry) father. Long story ""short"", dating is fucking hard. Had one 4ish month relationship in high school, over 10 years ago. Only tried dating 2 other times between then and this incident, ghosted after several weeks both times. First wasn't just once but 3 times.


ANYWAY, I met a wonderful woman(20s) through work a few years ago, and we got along really well. Both of us were viahmetly opposed to co-worker relationships, so at first it was easy.  Before she left, however, I fell HARD, and we stayed in touch after she left. A few months after she left I eventually got the nerve to ask her out for a morning coffee, and to my surprise she said yes. 


In a disastrous turn of events my elderly dog had a health scare the weekend before(date was set for Monday. He was okay). Upon reading the text from my family saturday morning, I cried until I puked and then drove 3 hours straight to my parents. Didn't get back to my place until about 10-11PM Sunday, and didn't sleep for shit all night. I did, however, sleep through my fucking alarm and accidently stood her up. Woke up, saw the time, saw her missed messages, and died inside. I apologized perfusely but didn't hear anything back. Next day I just went to where we planned to meet in hopes shed be there, and when I turned the corner her car was there. Being completely unprepared for anything good to actually happen to me, I freaked the fuck out and just drove by, eventually prepared myself for a good, much deserved, slap and circled back but she was gone. Still didnt hear anything that day, and spent the whole time debating if it was remotely appropriate to even be trying to catch her there. I decided it was at least probably legal, and worth the civil consequences so tried again the next morning. 


Aaand, it fucking worked. She was ordering when I walked in, so didn't see me right away, but when I told her she wasn't getting away without me making good on my promise to buy her a coffee she turned around and seemed to light up. We sat down, had a great talk, caught up from her last day at work etc. Planned a repeat. Repeat went swimmingly as well, and this went on for a few days. 


Eventually we made weekend plans, and I thought that went pretty swimmingly as well. It seemed like she actually liked me, and we spent most of the day together. I was unfortunately obsessing over whether she saw these as date dates or friend dates though, but was too scared to ask. The next weekend we had another big day, and at the end of it I really wanted to go in for a hug or kiss, or just ask what was up, but AGAIN I was too fucking scared. Thats the last time I saw her. She started flaking on every plan, and eventually just... *poof*.


My life really went to shit after that. I had to make the decision to put my dog down, on the phone with my crying sibling, while tripping on a large dose of magic mushrooms. As if that wasnt bad enough, I had to practically fucking beg my dad to let him go for days, after years of being told by dad ""I can't wait for your dog to die"", because he was helping my mom cope with a terminal illness. I had started a new job, my contract was coming up and my managers hadn't said anything about it. There was talk of outsourcing my job. A much older coworker(F50s, lets call her N) had asked me out before (F20s, lets call her S) ghosted me, which I declined but N kept trying even after I blocked her phone number. After S ghosted me N escalated to starting legal procedures claiming my boss encouraged ME to ask HER out, along with some other shit. Had a meeting with the company's lawyers lined up for weeks, stressing me the fuck out the whole time(N ended up getting fired, thankfully). Somebody tried to steal my car and caused $1k in damage. I was in fucking hell. Then, S got back in touch. Told me she had relapsed, her dream job had fallen through, and she left the state. We exchanged a few texts, but I said some stupid shit trying to make her feel better about the job not working out and she vanished again. I tried my best to forget her, but it just didn't work. I deleted her contact, but I couldn't forget her number. I tried to delete my memory with alcohol to no avail, apparently waking up still shitfaced for work gets trumped by the obsessive part of OCD. I kept up with the occasional texts, wishing her a happy birthday or just random well wishes, to no avail.


A few months later I started really struggling with psychotic symptoms. It devolved to a point where I was barely sleeping, and eventually peaked with a 5 day stint in which I slept maybe an hour a night. We had a training at work 2 days in that I couldn't even pay attention to. Going into the weekend my roommate(M20s, let's say P) and I went back to where S and I had our first weekend date(S and I were there in the summer, P and I were skiing). I felt like I was tripping without having taken any drugs. Reality meant nothing, I was convinced the entire time that P was going to just leave me there, or even kill me. At one point I ended up pretty far ahead of P, with nobody else around, and for about 45 seconds I was POSITIVE every person on the planet except myself had just disappeared. When we were leaving, traffic was backed up. I was freaking the fuck out in my head, P said something about happy thoughts so I forced myself to think happy thoughts and the traffic immediately cleared up, which made me spiral even more. I think I held it together pretty well, P asked why I was so quiet but that was it. When we got home he seemed to vanish, and I was convinced he had. Sorry, more context, one of my 3 best friends in Preschool was also named P. We went to different primary schools, and then his family moved in 2nd grade. In 9th grade he committed suicide. In my head it made more sense that I had died and was meeting P in the afterlife or something, it doesn't make sense now obviously but it was SO FUCKING REAL in the moment. The next day I still hadn't slept, and I ended up driving home to my parents. Huge chunks of the drive just vanished from my memory, at one point I 'woke up', didn't recognize where I was at all, and became SURE I'd missed the exit(I hadnt). Mom and dad were unhelpful at best, but my grandmother was a therapist so dad drove me over there. On the ride over I legitimately felt like I could just die if I wanted to. My hands ACTUALLY went numb, comfortably numb kind of numb. I didnt tell my parents or grandma about that, but she brought me to the ER, where I was given some mild sleeping pills and sent home where I slept for 16 hours straight. I had exactly 1 dream, in which S was sitting with me on my grandmother's couch, and she just asked me if I was okay. I did actually feel a lot better when I woke up.


2 months after that, 80% of my department got laid off, and I had to take on a bunch more workload. It seemed like we were making a comeback, and there was talk of hiring new people or people back(if they wanted). Until exactly 1 year, to the fucking day, since I saw S. Went into work feeling pretty bummed, then the CEO brought me into his office and told me my entire department was getting the axe. I immediately headed over to my last job, where I'd met S. It had been an amicable departure of ways, and I started back up the following day. 2 months after that I drove by the place I'd last seen S for the first time since. I was a complete and utter wreck by the time I got home, but I was resolute to not give into the compulsion to text her. To my absolute shock though, she texted me that night. 


Weve been texting regularly since, but she lives 1000 miles away and has a girlfriend. I'm beyond devastated, I've never felt like this about somebody. Every time we had a date, on the way there I felt like I was going to puke, but that would vanish the second I saw her. The only people I feel as comfortable with as her are my friends of 15-20+ years. I really thought she felt, at least close, to the same way, but I didnt want to lose her by trying to ask for more and being wrong. I still want to tell her just how much she means to me, but I feel like it would be inappropriate. I just dont know what I'm doing, what I'm supposed to do, what's fucking wrong with me, why I have to be such a fucking freak.

**The Packout**

[T22 Fully Packed Out](https://preview.redd.it/50pycb3z1oye1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b04cb19d7b08a1cbfcee674346486ef7f1630502)

A few notes about the configuration I went for on this trip and what I carried

Main Compartment:

* Medium compression packing cube with all my clothing for 2 days + pajamas.
* Small toiletry kit
* Emergency travel cube pouch (happy to talk more about this cube if anyone is interested)
* Small tech kit
* Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Noise Cancelling Headphones

Tech Compartment:

* Nothing. I was traveling with just an iPad mini this time.

Hatch:

* Deck of cards
* Notebook + pen
* Keys on the leash
* Disinfecting wipes

Across my chest, I carried the Alpaka Flight Sling 2L (*side note: this sling was the MVP of my trip and the best purchase I made this year*):

* iPad mini with pencil in Tomtoc case
* 10,000 mAh MagSafe battery pack + short USB c charging cable
* Cell phone
* A couple bandaids
* Microfiber cloth for glasses and electronics + a couple lens wipes
* Wallet
* Hand sanitizer, gum, and breath spray
* Loop Experience earplugs
* Sunglasses

**Experience**

I ended up having to carry the T22 fully packed out all day for 2.5 days because I had to switch hotels each night, so it was a perfect stress and security test to carry it all over San Francisco and the Bay Area. After carrying it non-stop for 2.5 days at a conference, to restaurants, through airports, and in various Ubers, I have some thoughts.

[T22 Under Plane Seat Like a Champ](https://preview.redd.it/vx29tj2t5oye1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ce6bec24211f8f2598612da2ae7d725ba75366c)

*The Joyful Experiences*:

* The **mesh zipper pocket** inside the main compartment is great! I couldn't carry my traditional tech kit this time if I wanted to keep the bag in unexpanded mode (more on that later), so I just put all my tech stuff together in there and it became a little tech pouch.
* I love that the **two mesh pockets on the back wall** of the main compartment perfectly fit a pair of over-the-ear headphones. It kept them out of the way and safe from being crushed, while still being easily accessible.
* I love all the **strap keepers/dangle stoppers**. Kept the straps from wandering out into the aisle on the plane and from catching on things while navigating crowded streets and restaurants.
* I love how **compact** the bag is and it was nice to not have to worry about bumping into people or snagging on anything.
* Incredibly **comfortable harness system**...with a caveat (more on that later). It's hard to find bags that are comfortable for women and this one is one of the best I've encountered.
* **The hatch** became more useful than I imagined while trying to quickly grab things on the plane and in Ubers.
* The **top handle** is a joy to use.
* It's a **conversation starter without being flashy**. I had a few people ask me about it because they've never seen a bag like it. You meet bag nerds everywhere! And while it does start conversations sometimes, mostly it's a very anonymous black bag and it doesn't scream ""please rob me!"" That was a huge bonus and made me feel safe while wearing it. 

*The Experiences That Gave Me Pause:*

* Yep, this is me circling back to the **expansion system**. I don't know if it's just my bag but the expansion system is so cumbersome to use. The zipper gets caught at the seams near the bottom of the bag where the bottom material meets the main body material. It takes a lot of fiddling to get the zipper past that point. I chose to leave my bag in unexpanded mode to avoid the headache. It also makes it so you can't use the hydrolock if it's expanded (at least, I couldn't get it to work in expanded mode).
* In theory the **hydrolock** is a great idea, but it's a pain to clip into place. It took me a good five minutes the first time I deployed it to get all 3 clips aligned and click them into place. It's easier when the bag is empty, but then it compromises access to the main compartment. If you're going to use it, I'd just leave it deployed all the time and just get used having less access on that side. I tend to just put my bottle in the main compartment when I'm carrying it in EDC situations.
* The **harness system** is excellent, but I noticed that when the bag was fully packed out, the shoulder straps tended to slide to the outside of my shoulder instead of staying firmly in the middle of the shoulder like it does when it's just packed out for EDC use. This is a common issue I have encountered with harness systems that seem to be designed and tested more with male frames (or broader shoulders) instead of female frames. It's not a knock against Fyro. It happens with Aer, Minaal, Cotopaxi, etc. I am sure Fyro had some female testers. I just hope that it's something that companies consider a little more in the future. I got around this by clipping the sternum strap when I was going to be wearing the bag for long periods, but it does put quite a bit of strain on the sternum strap--to the point where it made it hard to unclip it. I had to sort of do a hunch to bring the shoulder straps closer together so I could unclip. Just something to consider.

**Verdict**

Overall, I really love the T22. The issues I've encountered with it have been very minor and are in no way deal breakers for me, and I wanted to share my good and bad experiences so they might be helpful to someone else. It's a great first bag from a new company.

Here is a basic list of what is happening:  The moment I put anyting in my mouth--doesn't seem to be connected to a type of food--I swear the gurgling begins. It's like the saliva triggers it because it will start before I even swallow the food. I have a combination of gurgling, gassy pain with more of a constant ache in my upper gut. I find myself not wanting to swallow my food--almost with a bit of nausea at this point--so I chew and chew and chew and finally cross my fingers and swallow.

Favorite game?
Godzilla or robocop? 

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. I'm excited for the new Doom game. Will also be down playing games if we hit it off.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.


Huh, I honestly don't know what else to say. This is honestly so difficult.

I would just want someone around my age and be an actual real person. My luck hasn't been great at all. Someone should change that.

He said he hasn't been on prep despite getting it before the cruise. He said that it makes you feel like shit and he didn't want to feel like shit during his cruise so he'll start it after the cruise.

He's also expressed interest in seeing me again and me bottoming for him. Said he wants to ""tear me open"". I think the guy is hot. He thinks my skin is pretty and my body is goregous. And he seems down to indulge in all the kinks/stuff I named. So the sexual chemistry is certainly there. But knowing that he's raw breeding strangers with no condom and no prep is making me do a double take for everything. Which sucks because we actually get along and he seems like a nice guy. And I was really thinking about bottoming for him. He definitely seemed interested in meeting me in a non-sexual environment. Like we can just talk and laugh.

Edit: I feel like I finally found a decent guy to click with and now this. Maybe I'm thinking about stuff too deep? IDK.",0,1746325343.0,askgaybros,12,0.33,False

So…I’m (F22) a senior in college here at UNCW. I never really had that many friends growing up and had a not-so-good experience in high school. I really expected college to be my turn around. I transferred from community college to UNCW. I hit the ground running and was absolutely determined to make at least one friend. I attended so many events, joined clubs I was interested in, attempted to talk to classmates, even went to bars and coffee shops by myself, and…I have literally no friends. Like, zero. I saw a TikTok of graduating seniors all gathering at a bar nearby for funny graduation pictures and I literally burst into tears because I know I will never have that. My anxiety is just getting worse and worse and so is my depression. I just don’t know what else to do. I have done everything to make friends and I feel so pathetic because I crave friendship so badly. Everything I do in Wilmington, I have to do alone and it’s so painful.

I feel like I’m the only person here that hates it and I really don’t want to feel that way. Every day that I come here is a day of literally just surviving. I like my professors and my degree, but I literally have made zero friends. I still have a year and a half here because I changed my major and I’m dreading it at this point. I just need some advice on what I can do because I have literally ran out of options. People keep saying join clubs but I have done that and made no progress at all. I’m so tired of being this sad here :(",4,1746325296.0,UNCW,4,0.83,False

I know SGA is hindsuhht but think about the fact we didn't Actually start playing zu until like the last year. 

It was always playing veterans like Morris, montrez, and whoever the fuck had tenure. 

Aside from coffee and mann, I don't even know who our other bench players are. 

Look at Houston for example. I have never heard of half those players and look how well they're playing. We NEED BETTER player development.",12,1746325148.0,LAClippers,9,1.0,False
