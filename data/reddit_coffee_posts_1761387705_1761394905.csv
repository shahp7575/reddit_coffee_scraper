1ofq3ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1ofq3ou/23f4m_online_looking_for_a_real_connection_built/,23[F4M] #ONLINE - Looking for a real connection built on honesty and good vibes.,"Hi everyone. I hope you will have good day.

First of all, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to those who are about to spend their precious time reading my post. Maybe after reading this, we’ll have a chance to talk or maybe we won’t. Either way, I truly wish you find someone who’s right for you. My post will be quite long because I want to make everything clear before you decide to message me. Once again, thank you so much. ou can read my post as if I’m having a casual conversation with you

**I’m looking for a connection that grows genuinely over time from both sides.** ***Whether it turns into friendship or something more, I always value friendship first. because I believe real love comes from the time and effort we put into getting to know each other. Having friends from different places isn’t bad at all***. ***So let's be friend first, and let time show us what comes next.***

**I don't do voice call ! I prefer chatting over voice calls.**

**ABOUT YOU?**

**- Age: 27 - 33**

**-** Single (of course)

\- I just hope that if we’re on the same page, you’re serious when messaging me. Being serious doesn’t mean boring - it just means genuinely wanting to get to know each other.

\- I hope you’ll be open with me, because that’s important for us to build a real connection, right? I don’t mean you have to open up too much the first time we talk, we can just take our time and slowly get more comfortable and open with each other.

\- I'm the kind of person who doesn’t ask a lot of questions, and my energy usually depends on the person I'm talking with. What I mean is, if you’re a quiet person, I’m really sorry I probably won’t be able to keep the conversation going. But if you’re talkative and like asking questions, I’ll match your energy and ask you right back.

\- **What am I attracted to?**: I don't know what is the name of this body type - I like muscular chubby(?), foodie (like Asian food pleaseeee especially Viet food >.<) and also know to cook ( LOVE TO COOK ) , open-minded, fun, and playful person. When you truly understand what you want and need, do you think you’re ready for something like a long-distance relationship? Or do you just want someone to connect and talk with? I like a man who’s honest and straightforward, someone who doesn’t lie or beat around the bush. I like sweet guys, but not the overly cheesy kind. (I mean the ones who are naturally sweet, not trying to act like it when it’s not really their personality.)

**ABOUT ME!!!**

\- I'm Vietnamese and also live in Vietnam, you can see lot of pictures that I took in Vietnam and also Vietnamese food. **Time zone doesn't matter. It depends on whether both of us want to spend time together or not.**

\- I'm 23 years old, I know it might seem unusual for a to want to talk to people much older, but I often interact with older folks - they’ve helped me think things through and I’ve learned a lot from them. Of course, not everyone is perfect, but I really value the experience.

\- **Appearance:** 5'7 , chubby , glasses, brown eyes, black long curly hair (not natural), I don’t really judge whether I’m beautiful or not. I’m just a simple girl who doesn’t wear much makeup and prefers a modest, comfortable style.

\- **Personality:** **straightforward** (I’m straightforward, but that doesn’t mean I don’t respect you or being rude) , sometime I **swear a lot** and I need people who don’t get bothered by that or we can do that together. Honestly, I don’t really know how to describe myself. Sometimes I’m a very energetic and cheerful person, but other times I’m quiet and deep in my thoughts and that really affects my mood. Everyone has their own way of seeing me, eople see me differently, depending on their point of view.

\- **Hobbies**: going to zoo, museum especially history museum (even though I'm not good at history), reading romance novel, take picture from my phone - i dont have any a digital camera because I take pretty bad pictures, I don't play game much but I like watching Streamer play horror game and learning about that storyline - (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, etc) , love cookinggg so much, I’m an indoor person, but lately I’ve been trying to find reasons to go out more, to take photos of beautiful scenes and share them on Reddit. I really enjoy sharing the pictures I’ve taken. I love coffee and beer - I always want to try every kind of those. And....I do smoke cigarette, but sometime.

**My hobbies are pretty simple, nothing too special or cool. But I don’t mind hearing about yours and learning from them.**

**- Music:** Rap, Pop, R&B, Instrumental music and EDM, also Vietnamese, English and Spanish songs.

**- Movie:** Rom-com, comedy, action, Marvel (BIG FAN), sometime horror. I also love to watch How I met your mother, Modern family, Shameless, Brooklyn 99, Fresh Off The Boat, etc. **And a lot of cartoons, I also love Family guy - giggity goo!!!**

After you read all my post, If you are interested, don't hesitate to message me, **Please INTRODUCE ABOUT YOURSELF a little when you send me a message. Thank you!** I hope we will **CLICK!!!**

The AA Or Non AA One,"A simple test to see if you need to leave the rooms and if what I am saying is right. The fact is that AA does not work for most regardless of their whys. AA has been a failed program since the day it started. Here is what I tell people especially those out of the initial phases of recovery. Spend a week not going to meetings. Instead engage in physical fitness four or five days a week cardio based. Have a clean diet with minimal caffeine and sugar and decent proteins and carbs. Do meditation for 15 minutes a night. Start something to advance yourself whether it is getting a cert in your career or writing the first chapter of a book. At the end of the week see how you feel. Versus going to meetings every night or most nights, regurgitating your past in their negative circle. Sucking coffee and smoking outside at the breaks while you ingest sugar cookies. Compare the weeks. That test week above is my program of recovery to cure. You reinvent your life. AA wants you to mentally stay in your old one.

1ofq327,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofq327,In defense of Flick the Fixer,"I see the hate for this lil fella mostly comes from him ""being narcissistic"" and making a statue of himself at Bone Bottom, calling it an icon of hope. So today, I wanna tell you why that is incredibly brave and defiance as opposed to being narcissistic and why Flick deserve no hate, if not some more recognition for the kindness he brings to the pilgrim.

tl;dr: Flick, in his own way, unconsciously trying to deprogram the indoctrination of pilgrims that they cannot actively do anything, including seeking help for themselves. The statue in his image is a way to defy against the Citadel's rule against any other faith/religion/teaching outside of its own indoctrination. Also Flick is just a morally good bug that is NOT narcissistic.

Let's start by breaking down his personality.

1. Flick is not entrepreneurial/exploitative. Often time, he complies with the customs (of pilgrims) in Pharloom and even recognizes when his wish might be in contradiction of this customs.

Right from the get go, the pilgrims are taught to just aim for the Citadel and not seek any aid. The only providers of aid are the merchants (by way of providing supplies to the pilgrims like Pebb or Mort. We know that with rosaries being a representation of faith AND a fiat currency, it opens the door to pilgrims being exploited by the less faithful/more capitalist mind. Like Mort, who guilt-trip Hornet for not trading and giving him rosaries, and charging pilgrim for staying at his inn, as opposed to Creige at the Halfway Home.

Flick offers aid by delaying his pilgrimage to fix things around Bone Bottom (stating so in his dialogue by reassuring Hornet he is staying only to help others/things need fixing). Perhaps not for Hornet, I don't suppose he will see any compensation from any other pilgrims. But because of him fixing the Wishing Wall, the pilgrims could get some help, like getting garbs and seeing threats to the pilgrimage (like the Flintbeetle and Skull Tyrant) removed. Even so, Flick does not put up a wish saying buy me a coffee or subscribe to my OnlyFan. The three wishes that he puts up all point out first and foremost are for the pilgrims. The part he asks for himself is the materials, which himself not being a warrior, might be more difficult to gather all by himself. If nothing else, this is a collective effort. ""This thing helps everyone, I can fix it, someone please bring supplies."" Even then, the wishes might be meant for multiple pilgrims to chip in, like 3-5 shell shards per donation. Only Hornet sees it and be like, sure, here's everything you want.

And Flick recognizes this. The way of the pilgrims is not one of negotiation or bartering, like the merchants, the couriers, or any other NPCs like the huntress and the Pinsmaster that can also give their quests via dialogue in addition to being put on the wish wall. The pilgrims can only simply wish, and leave it up to the mercy for adventurers to fulfill their wish/their faith being rewarded by their higher beings. So Flick puts up a wish instead of asking Hornet directly. And even in putting up the wish (Bone Bottom Repairs), he recognizes that he is asking for more than a pilgrim should be allowed to (saying ""Why, I even went and added a little wish of my own to the wishwall! Fair’s fair. I did build the thing. Seems like the kingdom should be granting my wish before anyone else’s.""). And again, the wish wasn't even for only his own gain!!! It was to help everyone at Bone Bottom!!!

So view in this way, the statue is also meant to be helping. We don't have any dialogue from him recognizing the statue is in his own image. But as I argued above, Flick might be recognizing that it is arrogant, but fair recognition, of his labor and effort in service of the pilgrims.

2. Flick might not have a degree in philosophy. But he understands hope. So he thinks a statue is necessary but might not be able to come up with a different model than himself.

The bug wants to build a statue. All by himself. He calls himself a fixer, nowhere does he calls himself a sculptor or an artist. We don't know if he is capable of coming up with a a symbol of hope that can inspire hope for the pilgrims, in addition to one that he can create.

About what can inspire hope, these pilgrims supposedly come from all over the place, may not even share a language, much less customs and understanding. Take for example, Shakra coming from a place where battle stance is a greeting, something that scares the other pilgrims. So what kind of symbolism that can inspire hope but is also simple enough that it can speak to as many pilgrims as possible? Well, they all understand faith (if not religion) at least. And they understand stories. Based on the fact that they make camp here at Bone Bottom and talk to one another, a statue of someone might be a good ice breaker. It'll be easier for newly arrived pilgrims to be curious about a statue of someone as opposed to a statue of ""something"". Heck, might even help the new arrivals feel more at ease if they have a shared ""someone easy to pick on"" (like ""heh look at that pilgrim guy making a statue of himself, isn't that narcissistic?""). The fact that they don't even know the name of another random pilgrim (like Pilby for example), indicates that they don't care much about other pilgrims at the camp. But someone like Flick who goes around fixing things up, and then have a statue of him as the first thing new arrivals will see? That will get conversation going. That might even help fellow pilgrims bond with each other, now that guided tour group isn't a thing anymore due to the haunting.

You may counter, but what about any other thing inspired by the Citadel? A symbolism of the spinning tool, GMS, the choir, anything that indicates the success of the pilgrimage perhaps? Well, one, Flick may not know what those might be, due to him never having arrived at the Citadel. Besides, copyright infringement aside, there are enough Citadel stuff lying around indicating this is the path of pilgrimage, such as the supposed Pious Isamor statue in the background of Bone Bottom (thanks [YouTuber El Chiefo for this discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ehkWCx1kQ)). I'd even argue those stuff don't necessarily inspire hope, as 1) they are likely commissioned by the Citadel to indoctrinate, not by someone who has successfully arrived then returned to tell the tales (cause they're stuck in the Underworks or why would they ever leave the Citadel?) and 2) at this point the Citadel doesn't want more pilgrims! 

Yet another point to support a statue of a person as opposed to something more abstract, is the statues of Nyleth and Skarrsinger Karmelita, shard statues of various kind of ""beast"" bugs, as well as the various Chapels worshipping the literal shell instead of symbolism of the shell. These artifacts indicate that in Pharloom, the bugs understand individual bug and figure that has significant influence on their surrounding. Flick has at least known the existence of the Ruined Chapel, even if he doesn't know of Nyleth and Karmelita. So in his limited understanding, he might have thought, ah yes, let's put me up there, if nothing else, that is fair compensation for my effort to help others.

With all that about Flick is done, here's the part he needs help with that I want to argue for: 

3. The statue IN HIS IMAGE is NECESSARY.

Lacking written work, oral history is THE WAY for knowledge and more importantly, message, to be passed down. And from oral history comes the making of myths and legends that can help inspire something better down the line. I'd argue that it is way easier to share stories of a common bug going around helping people, and elevate that to become an example of good things can still happen around Pharloom, REGARDLESS of the Citadel and its doing. Much easier compared to put up a shell shard statue of a silken cocoon, the literal symbol of the kingdom yet only a few bugs even know that the GMS is inside. What would that inspire, instead of further indoctrination of the promises made and not kept by the pilgrimage and the Citadel?

But tying this back to the whole pilgrimage thing: Flick is delaying his own pilgrimage to take active action (something we all praise Sherma for as a character arc) right from the get-to to help others, instead of relying on pure faith, and yet does not bargain or negotiate, complying with the customs that is making wishes on the wall. His action inspires hope in a way that DOES NOT confront the belief of the pilgrim like how Hornet and Shakra first looked upon the pilgrims. Instead, his action inspires change/evolution just like that of Sherma. That goodness can come from direct action and taking care of each other, regardless of where your faith is directed. 

So to use his image is the most direct way to start this conversation for any pilgrims. Upon arriving at the camp, they'd be drawn to ask, who is this guy and why is his statue up there? And be drawn to these conversations about why indeed, does he do all of these things?

The sad thing for us, the players though, is Flick doesn't seem like he understands enough the significance of his action to be able to verbalize any of this. So he simply thinks, yeah, I did all the work, might as well get the recognition. Which, if just by itself, SHOULD BE ALSO FAIR. LIKE SHIT, HE IS THE KIND OF BUG THAT HELPED MOVE AN ENTIRE SURVIVOR CAMP IN ACT 3. Bro came here to pilgrimage and upon seeing the sorry ass state of the Citadel decided that nah, I'd be here helping others first.

He doesn't even ask for thanks or recognition from others. Yes, it is quite arrogant and presumptuous to just put a statue of yourself anywhere in Pharloom. But honestly, even Hornet tells Scrounge the Relic seeker to recognize Hornet's effort in gathering the relics once you complete the collection, and Scrounge just ignore it. You don't see anyone going around berating Hornet for that!! So if nothing else, this bug was just minding his business!!

But, the larger point should still be, even if Flick doesn't get it, his statue is necessary in making changes, at least at Bone Bottom. I can very well imagine a scenario where if Act 3 doesn't happen and GMS/Hornet keeps being the sleeping monarch, then future generation of pilgrim arriving after Flick has passed away would look upon his statue with reverence and respect. For someone who has done what he could to help increase the odd for the pilgrims he might never even know.",1,1761394687.0,Silksong,0,1.0,False

The Reverend Dr. Miles Kelly is a composite of two people I have met in real life. The fist was a former Annapolis Midshipman that was a Tackle on the Navy football team that felt the call to god, resigned from the academy and joined the Navy as an undesignated seamen. When I met him he was a BMC on the USS Blue Ridge in the 1980s, The second was a former colleague that would come to work at 4 am, work his 8 hours and then go preach. I was an early guy too so we talked a lot usually over a cup of coffee. He would go to the roughest parts of Baltimore and preach to the drug dealers and all of that element. The man was fearless. When I asked if he was worried about being hurt, he said he wasn't worried about it all, if god called him home than it was his time. 

While I am not at all religious I respect those that are the ""real deal"" and will make personal sacrifices for their faith. Both these men made a huge impression on me and I thought in a book that highlights good vs. evil through the lens of self interest,  their ""voice"" needed to be included.""

Then i had spicy noodles and once I went to the toilet after eating them, I had constipation. I got back and felt bad. Like a little disoriented. Then i got shivers without cold and a little fever for half an hour. My mental level got really bad during this fever and it's been off since. I had constipation which got better with laxatives and pro bitoics though when I stop taking pro biotic, it returns. I've been to multiple GPS and they say all major signs are fine and I've done a comprehensive blood test which shows all major organs are fine. Only that I have vitamin d and b 12 deficiencies which I'm taking trratments for now. But my mental level is terrible still. And it began that day and hasn't gotten better. I feel weird about my body. Like sometimes i forget im a human with hands and legs and feel like I won't be able to move them but I still can never had an issue.  Mentally i can remember fine but there's this weird feeling of ""is this for real ?"" for everything. I still okay video games and win just fine.

He also added extra to the tooth to cover a craze line (I did not ask for this and it's a little lumpy/uneven) and the other front toot, I guess because its enamel was also thin.

Here's the thing though: I'm a two cups of coffee (with milk) per day minimum gal. I love a glass of rose or white wine at dinner. I know straws can reduce contact, but I have OCD and it's not an option for my brain.

How quickly do we think my habits will stain the composite? And should I ask him to reverse the part covering the craze line because the last thing I need is the whole tooth being discolored.

1ofpvzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ofpvzx/saltwater_22/,Saltwater (2/2),"I breathed as deeply as I could to try and calm myself. Glancing feverishly around for anything to barricade the door with, I realized we were in another bunk room, this one with larger beds, a higher ceiling, and more room. Officer’s quarters more than likely. The corner of the room held a wooden alcove blocked from view by a soft maroon curtain. These beds too held the remains of their occupants, with their clothes and artificial lungs folded neatly by their skulls. Footlockers sat at the end of each bed and I approached, desperate for a gun, or knife, or wooden stake.

Rifling through the belongings of the trunk labeled R. Schmidt bore no fruit, and I moved onto the next bed down the line. J. Hohe’s Locker held only old clothing and indecipherable letters. I cursed and began to stand too quickly, banging my head on the bed above. Its chains clanked and bones clattered onto the floor around me. I rubbed the sore spot, then ran on the balls of my feet to where Pieter still lay. Whispering a prayer under my breath I pulled his auxiliary tank off and set it on the ground nearby still attached, then rolled his body onto his back, and placed my ear to his chest listening intently. The soft rhythmic thumping of his chest was nearly drowned out by the ravings of the monster, but they were there all the same. My heart lifted a little. If I could manage to get him awake, Pieter could help me into my atmospheric suit and I could return to the surface to get him help. My hope disappeared as I checked him for any other injuries. The twisted ankle had become a break, his bone jutting out through his skin and far too much blood trickling out of it. There was no way for him to make it up the ladder we entered from. Not with only me to help. 

My medical training started and ended with rescue diver experience, and I tried to attend to his wounds the best I could. A record sprint to the medical bay and back left me with an ancient bottle of peroxide and a tourniquet. I twisted the device over his thigh until I couldn’t anymore and unstopped the bottle. I doubted the efficacy of eighty year old wound cleaner, but upon pouring the solution over his leg, Pieter was brought back to consciousness, quite literally kicking and screaming. Even if it hadn’t helped sanitize, at least I wasn’t alone in here anymore.

*“JEZUS GODVERDOMME CHRISTUS!”*

“Sorry Pieter, fuck’s sake, I was worried I’d lost you.”

“My head! God above”

“Gimme a sec, I’m gonna find you some bandages” Standing, I began my way back to the already open footlockers. I grabbed what looked to be a cotton jumper and began tearing it into strips. Bone crunched under my foot and I looked below. Tiny, brittle, fragments splintered beneath my sock, but something was odd. Around my foot were a handful of human ribs, all of them cracked in the middle. It was too perfect to have happened when they had all fallen. Confused, I peered up into the bunk which they had fallen from, and grabbed another bone at random. The partial femur my hand had selected came away neatly from its other half. There was no marrow in the broken segment. Every single other bone was exactly the same, cracked neatly down the middle, absent of marrow, and meticulously seated into its other half. All of the skeletons were anatomically correct, with not so much as a fingerbone missing. Pieter groaned again.

“Ah Christ, sorry” I jogged back over to Pieter and began wrapping his ankle. “Alright soldier, I need a way out of here” I pulled the bandage tight to his protest, and moved to the head wound I wouldn’t have noticed if not for his previous exclamation.

“Medical bay…saw a map of the place” It was good enough. I hoisted him onto my shoulder and slowly shuffled us back towards the nearest free bed. The monster had gone quiet now, which made me uneasy. Pieter didn't seem to mind the silence. I don’t think he would’ve cared about anything at that point. I tried to lay him gingerly onto the bed but my foot slipped and he tumbled onto it a little rougher than I would have liked. He moaned.

“On the…wall, by the records” The ship's schematic was tacked slightly askew onto the siding of the medical bay. Studying it, I saw that down the yet unexplored hallway in the bay was the front torpedo room. I checked my memory and figured that was around where the damage to the hull would be. 

“I’ll be right back Pieter” He grunted in acknowledgement. I slipped my way through the unexplored hallway until I reached the room depicted. Four large circles lay at the front of the room, and great black scorch marks stretched across the inner right wall of the prow. At the site of impact was a grey metal sheet welded carefully to its place. On the ground beneath the artful repair job was a long, rotting bough of timber. The realization struck me only then. Either one of those corpses was a traitor, or these men had sunk themselves. My head reeled. I understood so very little. Pulling open the hatches to the torpedoes, I raised my flashlight and peered inside. All but one of them were still filled, though I doubted any of them would fire if launched. Maybe the red lever attached to the empty tube would open the outer hatch, but I made no attempt to pull it. I made my way back to my friend to check his condition. His teeth were starting to chatter, and his cheeks were losing their color. Piling the old, thin, bleached blankets around him, I checked his pulse again, then made my way over to the wall. 

Now, I tore the blueprint from the wall and placed it on the table amidst the still open medical folders. Getting Pieter to translate for me, I figured the ship was now divided into “Our side” and “Its side” by the door between the officers’ quarters and the radio room. There would be no escape for either of us if I didn’t explore further into the ship. Pieter’s occasional insights illuminated the only way out for either of us. Through the currently sealed bulkhead was the radio room, followed by another storage room, and an electrical engine room. Pieter inhaled sharply and in a strained voice, said

“There will be diving suits in the rear storage room. They are old, and likely in poor condition, but you only need to make it back to the diving bell.”

We both knew going out as I was now, the pressure would crush me. Worse comes to worst, I would still prefer that to the alternatives waiting for me here, but I would take any chance I had to get off of this ship in one piece. I remembered something and found myself growing curious. There was still something left to check before leaving Pieter alone in the dark.

Ripping open the filing cabinet, I began removing and opening every folder I could. Petty officers, engineers, radio operators, even the captain. All marked with the same red curse. Then, nearly through the last drawer, I found it. That thing still had the same face. Thinner, but no older than the picture in front of me. Red ink on this page too, but not used for words. Like a child draws on a wall, the information had been scribbled and struck through in a manic, absurd way. A few words were left unblemished, of them I could only understand one.

“**WUNDERWAFFE”**

After what I’d been through, it didn't even make me blink. I did one last check on Pieter, and exited from the medical bay. Averting my eyes from the trash pile as I passed through the storage room, I tried not to consider its implications, but failed. Now, the squeeze through the industrial ever-coitus of pipes as I made my way towards the curtain in the officers’ quarters. If I was going to get anywhere near that thing, it would not be unarmed. The sound began again.

Distant, echoey thuds though softer than before, like flesh on metal. The thing had dropped its hammer when it noticed me, and when I again reached the officer’s quarters, I took the time to retrieve it, placing it in my belt. Pulling back the maroon curtain, I nearly cried in relief at the otherwise pitiful sight that awaited me. Similar to his crew, Captain Wohler’s bones were naked and snapped cleanly. His clothes were folded neatly at the top of his bed, but there was no rebreather. The captain’s cause of death was far more obvious. In his right hand was a small pistol that the reports would list as a Walther PPK. In the right temple of the captain's skull was a round hole that was mirrored on the left side where the bullet exited. The lead had lodged itself in the wooden wall, but was completely clean otherwise. I realized as I pulled the little pistol from the Captain’s hands that it too was untarnished. No rust, or viscera, and not so much as a streak of gunpowder on the ivory grips. I pulled back the slide, and sure enough, a round sat squarely in the chamber. The gun’s magazine was missing only a single round, but any extra ammunition could make the difference. 

I began to rummage through the writing desk to the captain’s left. An empty bottle of Peach liquor, stationary, an old dead flashlight. I sighed when my hand brushed the empty leather holster, and I found a single extra magazine beneath it. I set the pistol into its place and snapped the holster onto my tool belt, removing some of the less useful items from it and setting it on the desk to try and balance the weight. Sat on top of the desk were two things. A worn gun cleaning kit, and a document flecked with dried blood. I realized then. 

There was only one way an eighty year old war relic could have been kept in such great condition. My stomach turned at the thought of that thing rearranging the finger bones of his superior exactly as they were when he found him. Here was where the pinky bones went, the thumb wrapped like that. Reconstituting the suicide of his captain God knows how many times. All to keep things in proper order. To what end? Pushing aside the thoughts I picked up the document, knowing very well I wouldn’t be able to read a word of it. It was handwritten in an unsure, staccato script. Bold lettering stared from the top and an icon of a German eagle perched in the upper-left corner A thin yellow sheet fell from under my fingers, joined at its top to the document by glue. I hadn’t known the Nazis used carbon copying but the sheet was perfectly familiar to me all the same. I gently tore off the bottom sheet, folded it twice across its center, and tucked it beneath my water proof undersuit, not wanting the sheet to be ruined if I did somehow make it out. There was little else keeping me now. It was time. 

With no great show, I passed out of the curtain to the grisly scene, spun open the door to the unknown, and marched forward.  
  


The dark is far scarier when you know something lurks within. My spine tingled and my hands shook as I resealed the hatch behind me, The clanging was intermittent now, and inconsistent in its tone. The noise felt far enough for me to continue forward with my light on, but not comfortably so. I took very little notice of the radio room as I crept through it, paying far more attention to my feet. One stubbed toe or upset waste bin could very well kill me and leave Pieter to choke, or freeze, or die of whatever else. One foot in front of the other kept me occupied, and moving forward. When I  reached the door to the storage room it was pulled mostly closed and I peeked in. No faces stared back at me, and the door to the Electrical engine was shut completely. I hurried in and took stock. 

Three aged diving suits hung on hooks on the left wall. I closed in and touched my fingertips to the bronze helmet of the one closest. Quickly now, I slipped out of my belt and into the reinforced oilskin jumpsuit. These too had been perfectly maintained. I suppose the ship’s sole crewman had a lot of time to read manuals and practice upkeep. My fingers fumbled as I fastened and buttoned myself, listening intently to the next room over for any changes in behavior. Now for the helmet. The tanks the suits originally had were hefty, and likely contained no oxygen anyway, and would be left here, as my auxiliary tank would be enough and could fit in the mass of the helmet and under the oilskin suit. More buttons, screws, pausing every time the noise stopped. At this point everything was at least on my body except the boots, which would clang loudly against the flooring if I walked with them on. I grabbed them up, retied my belt, and began back towards Pieter when a new sound began to ring through my helmet. 

Familiar electronic beeping filled my ears; the thirty minute alarm on my rebreather was telling me I didn’t have much longer. I switched off my flashlight and began to undo the bolts securing the helmet to the suit. Stumbling backwards through the darkness, I backed to the wall where the suit had hung and pressed myself against it, still feverishly tearing at the fasteners. The thing had stopped making noise, and to my horror, I heard the sound of a hatch wheel spinning. We had never been safe at all, of course that thing knew how to use the doors. A guttural scream as I slipped my hand through and stopped the alarm, the sound of the hatch being flung open and then, stillness. A thud…another, it was approaching my wall. More footsteps until I felt it. Fingers brushing against the outer layer of my suit. Heavy breathing from the pale man as I held my hand over my mouth to stifle the sound of my own panicked gasps. The fingers turned sharper, pressing into the suit. I had no doubt the monster could shred through it with its nails if it wished. I did not scream, nor did I sob, nor did I run. It was over and I was dead, except. 

*\*CLANG\**

A loud crash, joined by an accented voice

“Come and get some, you freak!” Pieter's strained voice was distant but recognizable. He began to sing in a bassy voice. *“Wat zullen we drinken – Zeven dagen lang…”* It was an old drinking song he’d taught me when we first met. Pieter had heard us, and was pulling its attention away. The pressure on my chest disappeared and was replaced by the loud slaps of the monster’s bare feet sprinting towards the cacophony. Rhythmic metal clanging as Pieter began banging two cans together and continued. *“Wat zullen we drinken? Wat een dorst!”*

I could not let him kill himself, not with the family he would leave behind. I ripped the gun from its holster and took my flashlight with the other hand, attaching it to my chest. The boots slid on easily and I clanged after the two of them, speeding up when I heard the bulkhead slam open. As I closed in, Pieter’s singing raised in pitch abruptly, and then cut off, as a loud thump shook the ship. My heart sank. When I entered the trash storage room, and found the two of them, the pale figure was huddled with its back to me, crouched on the ground, moving its head wildly. Pieter lay gasping, flat on the floor in front of it. 

“Get the fuck away from him!” I shouted with all the courage I could muster, gun pointed squarely at its head. It stopped moving, and dropped what it was holding. Pieter’s leg rolled from behind its frame, detached at the knee. Chunks of flesh were ripped from the calf,  and the ankle was now almost disconnected. I tracked it with the sights as it brought itself up on its legs as it turned to face me, teeth bared and coated in red. The gun fired once, almost startling me, the report echoing through my entire body. The round caught the monster in its cheek and made the thing scream. I lowered the pistol slightly, not trusting my aim as it charged for me. My fingers moved on their own, squeezing the trigger until the gun clicked. I might have closed my eyes, I don't really remember. It had been hit in the chest and fallen to its knees, some organ deep inside its skinny body was perforated, making a hissing sound. Our eyes met, his now a deeper blue than before, far less wild and frantically tracing over my own. The bullet holes dripped a clear, thick mucus, and he fell now completely, his cracked lips moving wordlessly. Weakly, he lifted his arm from the floor, reaching out towards me, his hand open rather than clawing. A death rattle escaped his bloodied mouth, and the monster’s head fell to the floor, his heart stopped. 

I flung myself down to Pieter’s side, and thanked God for the monster picking the already tourniquet wrapped leg to gnaw at. A pool of blood crept from Pieter’s stump, but far less than there would have been. The shock had knocked Pieter out, but I promised to return with help all the same. It was not yet a lie when I said it.  
Water was sloshing from behind me now. I cursed myself for not just leaving and turned to face my death but, the creature lay still where it was. I drew closer, pulling out the thick hammer. The pale man was melting. His skin liquefied, then collapsed into the new cavity. A bubbling, murky white liquid filled his innards until its skeleton and the basin of its ribs collapsed as well. The frothy seafoam that was my attacker only moments ago drained into the tightly slitted floor below us. The only thing I could do for Pieter now was getting help from Command. I prayed aloud as I crashed towards the torpedo room..  


When I reached the surface without Pieter, the storm had not passed. The journey back up had been far more violent, though I hardly noticed the shakes and shudders of the bell. My radio, foolishly left behind, likely wouldn’t have worked anyway, and the dive phone remained unanswered no matter how many times I tried to key into Command. My borrowed helmet was already off when the door to the bell was finally opened. Command, or as I knew him, Paul, leaned over the open hatch, hair plastered against his head from the rain and sea-spray. Only then did I start crying.

“Pieter’s still down there, get me another suit! We’ve got to go get him back!” Paul shouted something back to me, but his words were stolen by the wind and booming thunder. I grabbed onto the ladder, and started making my way out. Paul’s rough hands grabbed at the scruff of the suit, and he hoisted me out, both of us tumbling onto the deck of the ship. Men rushed about around us, hollering orders to each other, desperate to break through the din. The words tumbled again from my mouth.

“He’s hurt bad Paul! His leg was ripped off! He doesn’t have much time, please, you have to send me back dow-” Paul cut me off, shouting over the roar as the sea swelled around us.

“You’re not going back down there son. Not like this” Rising to my feet now.

“HE’LL DIE DOWN THERE IN THAT FUCKING SHIP IF YOU DON-”

I stopped myself. Bright lights surrounded our ship, and I realized I was in the middle of a small flotilla. A large navy cruiser bobbed in the water next to us, with three smaller PT boats escorting it. A second ship from the company's own fleet sat on the opposite side of our boat. On it, two other men were in the middle of putting on their diving suits. Paul shouted to me again.

“The others will handle it from here, right now the best thing you can do is give us information”

I paused for a moment, steadying my breathing, then raised my voice

“Make sure they have auxiliary tanks, there’s no water in the submarine.” Paul stared at me for a beat, then tapped his ear as though he had misheard me.  


I told them the same story time and time again, down to the look in that thing's eyes as it died. They never laughed once, nor was I shouted at or accused. Those men moved me from dull room to dull room, and I talked at their suits and ties for God knows how long. There were no handcuffs, or chains, or orange jumpsuits, but I knew very well that I would not be able to leave their custody until they found it appropriate. They put us in these cramped rooms with a bed, and a lamp, and a little attached bathroom so as to keep us from interacting with each other. The worst part was not knowing if Pieter was dead or just asleep one door down the hall. They wouldn’t tell me anything about what I saw either. I expected dropped jaws, or gasps, or maybe smirks when I spoke about the thing down there, but got blank stares instead.

You have to understand. That’s why I did it. I hadn’t even remembered the carbon copy until I stripped down to bathe that first night. It fluttered out of the undersuit I had on and onto the floor. I started to call out to let them know about it when I realized they would already have all the info on it. I took a closer look instead. The suit had kept it protected from the sea spray but not from my sweat. Thankfully, I could still make out the uneasy script, moist as it was, as well as the faint gray cross from where I had folded the paper. I laid it out to dry under one of the bleached white towels they provided us, and it sat either there, or folded against my body until they finally let us go weeks later.

The worker’s comp form read “Short term psychosis caused by Carbon Monoxide poisoning” and the medical leave was indefinite, which I took full advantage of. Phony as the cause may have been, the sizable check gave me a war chest of sorts. I had enough money now for a few private investigators, a German translator, and plenty of sleeping pills. The PI couldn’t find so much as a trace of Pieter or his family. No phone bills, or social media, or obituaries. He couldn’t even prove that the address Pieter had given me for Christmas cards ever belonged to him. Of the two divers who had gone down after me, one was killed in a car accident shortly after, and the other refused to answer any of my messages. Paul, however, had heard from him.

Paul had quit, of course, and was living in Florida when we found him. He agreed to meet and I caught the next available flight. Neither of us were much interested in pleasantries or catching up, we knew each other far too well for that sort of thing. The coffee his wife poured us sat untouched for the duration of our conversation, slowly growing colder in their chipped white mugs. I went first, recounting my story for the last time, until now. Paul’s reactions were far more in tune with what I expected, and I didn’t notice myself trembling until he grabbed my shoulder, and asked me for a break with tears in his eyes.

Pieter was our friend, and Paul had known him longer than I did. Pieter had gone to his wedding, and they’d held each other's kids. Pieter was dead, and neither of us were buying it. The official story made no mention of any injuries found, or autopsies performed. According to the rescue dive report Pieter was found “Cold and unresponsive with no pulse, body was recovered, remains cremated and sent to surviving family” Paul of course couldn’t find Pieter’s family either, though I suspected he hadn’t tried as hard as me. He seemed to be ready to leave it all behind, and I found out why as he went on. 

By the time the rescue crew surfaced, Paul was already at port, being interrogated in a room near mine. Eric, the one who had disappeared, had called Paul about a month after we had been released. Paul said he sounded frantic, and Eric told him that the report was wrong. When they had gotten down there, Pieter was still breathing, but seemed to have dragged himself to the medical bay and fallen unconscious on one of the beds. His leg was still in the storage room, eaten like I had said. Paul said the phone line was disconnected mid sentence shortly after, and he wasn’t able to get much more of use out of him.

At this point, I find it prescient to reveal to you what I was keeping from Paul, as I did to him when I was told this. My carry-on for the flight to Orlando was light. An overnight bag with some cash, my wallet, a change of clothes, and a manilla folder carrying the translated copy of what I found on the Captain's desk. The college student I had hired to do it was smart, but we only corresponded online. I was able to convince her I was a German author trying to break through into the English market. If only. The document was not, as I had originally thought, a log from the captain’s journal. It was a radio message, decoded by hand, and read as follows:  


*For immediate action.*



*This is a message for Captain Wohler of U-897. This relay will entail your final orders, and last communication from German High Command. The war is lost, and the Reich will soon fall. You must honor your countrymen by completing this final task to its fullest. The encroaching Allies must not be allowed to gain control over this wonder-weapon of ours, and its destruction is impossible. The war correspondent newly assigned to your crew is to be preserved within your ship until such a time that a successor to our great Reich can retrieve him. All records of your submarine, its crew, and its current location have been destroyed, and only a select few ‘designated survivors’ of the Reich have been trusted with its knowledge.*



*Upon reaching the previously discussed coordinates, you are to detonate a scuttle charge, and sink your ship, so as to give an outside appearance of destruction during battle. The breach is then to be repaired, and any sea water is to be pumped out. Should the correspondent ever become frantic at any point during this operation and begin to undergo the transformation early, make no attempt to harm him. Any damage inflicted upon him will be repaired in whole after liquefaction and reformation, and his memory will remain intact. The hatch on your conning tower has already been sealed, so as to prevent any unwanted egress by the correspondent. He, and the rest of your crew are at no time to be made aware of any other possible exits*



*Upon completion of the above duties, you are relieved of your command, and no more is expected of you. Your’s, and your crew’s sacrifice will be honored for generations to come in the hearts of every German.*



*Hail Victory,*



*Generalfeldmarschall Kreutz*

*March 30th, 1945* 

Paul, finished reading now, leaned back into his chair, closed the folder, and put his hands over his eyes. I took the opportunity to ask him.

“What else did Eric say before the call was cut off. Did he see him?”

“He said nothing else save for how you were mistaken and the leg was broken in two places other than one, but knowing them, there’s no way they would have left Pieter down there if they had any choice.” I breathed through my nose and stared down at the floor, thinking. Something wasn’t sitting right.

“How did they know the leg was broken in two places if they were in such a rush to find Pieter?”

“He said it was pretty obvious. When they went to pick up his bones, they had been snapped in half. I figured that’s what you came upon when you found that thing over Pieter.”

My heart thudded against my chest. That wasn’t how I had left his leg, but I suppose I should have already expected as much. Thanking Paul for his time, I stood,  shook his hand, and left his house. There was a return flight to catch. I don't think Pieter is still down there, and I pray every night that thing still is. A part of me can't help but wonder, though. If it learned how to maintain that ship in perfect darkness, then maybe I taught it how to leave.

I do not dive anymore. I hope I’ll never have to again.

1ofptnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ofptnl/saltwater_12/,Saltwater (1/2),"I do not dive anymore. 

Fifteen-hundred feet below the ocean waves, the pressure can reach nearly forty-five times that of the surface. Between the diving bell and atmospheric suits we were wearing, I ought to have felt no different than if I were standing on the beach in my hometown. I felt every drop of water bearing down on me. We lurched suddenly and I heard a screech as if the metal were shearing off of the walls around us. 

“Feisty today, no?” Pieter broke the relative stillness

“Yeah well, The North Sea ain’t exactly known for being kind to her winter guests”  I half laughed back, failing to disguise the shake in my voice, then started again. “Did you see how those guys in port were looking at us? And those suits on the boat sure had a fire under their asses.”

“The bosses always act like we are the turtle, and they the rabbit” Pieter chortled, and I joined him, having no idea what he meant, but thinking his accent made the word “turtle” sound funny. We had met on the night of my first day in Europe, six months back when I, upon joking that, much like their shoes, Dutch people made their diving equipment out of wood, received a swift punch to the gut and all the beer I could drink for the rest of the night. We’d been cool ever since.

“I still can’t believe they’ve got us starting a salvage operation in December.” I said “Didn’t our contract say we would just be doing rescues until April?” The diving bell lurched again, my heart moving with it. I still couldn’t see anything out of its tiny porthole. Pieter spoke calmly

“I don't know, some of the guys were saying this was government work”

“You think this is big”

“I think I just said I don’t know” We both laughed again. Pieter was cool, had a good head on his shoulders. He was former Dutch Navy, and had been diving for nearly ten years. Compared to him I was green as grass. They told me things would have gone better if I had been a little more experienced. I doubt it.

I approached the porthole and squinted into the dark. Nothing. They had already sent a remote submersible down to scout out the wreckage. We were looking for U-897, a German submarine from the second world war. The only other thing we were told was that the U-boat appeared to have a breach in its front right-side hull. I stood there squinting through the layers of glass until slowly, a radio antenna drifted into view, then the tower, and then, as if Leviathan itself, the hulking, bloated body of the ship. My stomach crawled at the sheer size of the thing. I thought I had a strong stomach for these kinds of things. Crawling around rusty oil tankers and rotted shipping boats was my trade after all, but something about how the boat loomed towards us set me the wrong way.

“She’s massive” Pieter whistled “I don’t remember there ever being a German submarine that was this big”

“Know a lot about Nazi ships?” I teased

“More than you think” he responded in a flat tone. The diving bell finally settled just above the seafloor and Command came on the dive phone

“Command to divers one and two, you are clear to leave the bell when ready. The storm has gotten nastier since you boys left, so don't worry if comms cut while you’re down there.” 

That made me feel worse, but there was no point in complaining. If the big wigs wanted this done and we came back empty handed there would be no telling what they’d do. Pieter began to open the bottom hatch, and though I hadn’t stepped in a church for many years, I crossed myself just in case.  


Despite it all, the sand felt good beneath my boots. It was nice to have semi-solid ground beneath me even if it was ultimately less safe out here than in the bell. We trudged slowly towards the hulking mass in front of us, our diving lights whispering onto its surface at first, then slowly revealing its true figure. I swept my light across the hull, stopping at the ship’s designation. Drawn nearly as large as I was read “**U-897**” I pushed the button on my communications devices

“Well at least they dropped us at the right war grave” I joked. Pieter chuckled and started around the front of the boat.

“We are on the wrong side to see the breach, let us go around.” He sounded almost excited. Maybe the comms had distorted his tone. I switched the channel to let Command know we had gotten to the ship, and pressed the talk button.

“Diver two to Command, we are on foot circling around to the starboard side of the sub to get a better look at that breach.”

“...”

“Two to Command, you guys copy?” 

“...” 

The dead air hung in my helmet and I kept a little closer to Pieter than I otherwise would have. Just as we began to turn with the curve of the submarine's prow, a dark mass wriggled past the edge of my vision. My head snapped to follow it, but I lost its shape. Probably just a blue shark. Bastards are big, but don’t tend to come after people. And even if he did, he’d have to get through a metal suit and my dive knife. That’s what I told myself at least; the heart doesn’t often care what the mind has to say.

“Oh! Look at that!” Pieter’s voice rang in my ear. I turned my headlamp so my light met with his and saw a hole about three  meters wide. Except that wasn’t right, the “hole” was covered from the inside by what looked to be a sheet of metal. A patch job. I jumped as Pieter's voice again filled my ears

“What’s wrong about this?” 

“Well, if this sunk the ship, then how did they repair it without drowning?”

“They could have sealed off the area and sent in their welder with a dive suit, look closer” I brought my hand to the hull but the eerily clean surface gave nothing away. “I give up”

“There’s no scorch marks. There's no anything for that matter” 

It was obvious to me then. The ship had sat at the bottom of the North Sea for more than eighty years, and I hadn’t seen so much as one barnacle on it, no algae, nothing. My headlamp traced down the body of U-897. Smooth and black as far down as I could make out save for the rungs of a ladder leading up to the conning tower.

“I don’t like this” Pieter said nothing, stood for a moment, then shook his head and started up the ladder.

The climb was slow going. You have to undergo quite a bit of strength training for this kind of job, but with the weight of the actual suit, as well as all of our tools, the best we could manage was hooking our first arm, then our second, then first leg, then second. Over and over for nearly thirty feet. Pieter again cut the silence

“These men were able to patch their breach, but they were not able to get off of the sea floor. These boats had maybe two days of Oxygen if the men used their respirators. They likely used it all up and-”

“Good. Nazi bastards.” I interjected

“Nobody should suffocate, especially not us. When we get in there, if by some miracle the ship has not flooded again from another leak, we need to take off our suits and switch to our auxiliary tanks. There is no way we can move around in open air with these.”

“Calling it ‘Open’ is pushing things, Pieter” I couldn’t tell if he was chuckling with his mic off, but I suspected he was. We had come close to the top of the tower when Pieter signaled for me to hold where I was. He crawled his way onto the platform and stood up, looking down at his feet. His mic switched on

“You need to come and look at this” His voice sounded strained. I pawed my way up to the top of the listed tower and looked where Pieter’s helmet was pointed. The outside of the entry hatch was welded shut.



Initially, the main goal of this operation was retrieval of information. Documents, manifests, anything that could tell us what this ship was for and how it got to be so far below the waves. We expected to come across locked doors, collapsed entryways, and all manner of debris, so we had brought a handful of tools to help us get through these barriers. Our acetylene torch would burn through the weld and allow us entry quite readily, if we used it. Something in my gut kept turning over as I began my plea.

“Pieter, are you sure you want to do this without any radio contact with Command.”

“Yes. Whatever happened here was big, and I would like my children to see their father on the television”

“We can come back once we’ve called them on the dive phone, they very well might not even want us to continue like this. It isn’t like the sub is going anywhere”

“They are in the middle of a storm. If we came all the way out here for nothing, we would get one hell of an out-chewing. I am going into the boat” I laughed a bit, minding that I didn’t accidentally turn on comms, as Pieter pulled out his torch and began cutting through the weld. He knew very well I wouldn’t turn back without him, even if I was well within my rights to. I stepped back, and let him work. Not much to do but wait. 

After a few minutes the weld had completely melted and Pieter attempted to lift the hatch. It was stuck fast from the water pressure. I joined him at his side and we both wrenched at the door. A rushing noise and the hatch flew open, water feverishly sucked into the newly gaping maw. It stopped shortly after, and we began our descent. The room we dropped into was large, and by Pieter’s account, seemingly pressurized. I closed the hatch and secured it into place. We hadn't had to unlock the hatch coming in which struck me as odd. Without any power in the sub we would either have to manually pump the water out of the room, or let it drain into the rooms surrounding the main entryway. Not wanting to ruin any still surviving documents, we began our search

“If you find any buttons or levers, please tell me before you push them” 

“Sure Pieter” The water was mostly clear, but the refraction from my light meant I had to get close to see what something was. Dials for pressure gauges and fuel levels, buttons and switches to Lord knows what. I had no clue exactly what I was even looking for, but continued searching all the same. We kept on like that for a bit, my eyes tracing uselessly over the German signs until Pieter exclaimed

“Aha! Here. If I pull this all the water will drain into the ballast tanks. Not like she will need to get off the seafloor anytime soon, right?” I looked over where he was standing. It was a lever I had already looked at, but passed over for seeming unimportant. Pieter ‘knew’ German in the sense that he could speak it like a preschooler, and used Dutch and English cognates to fill in the gaps. His pseudo-fluency was one of the reasons we were selected for this salvage, though it was our off-season, so they didn’t have many options.  He gripped the lever and wrenched his arm back. A loud metallic clank and the water level began to lower around us. I saw as Pieter 

hurriedly shook himself from his suit whilst still aided by the lift of the water, and I did the same. I wasn’t fast enough however, and ended up on my back, unable to wriggle out of the suit’s chest and helmet. Pieter sauntered over laughing and with his respirator muffling his voice, pointed at me and said.

“Turtle!” I chuckled in turn. He helped me out of the suit and hoisted my oxygen canister onto my back. I stood and stretched my arms, happy to be free of the extra weight. It was hard to tell from outside, or while still buoyant from the water, but the ship tilted slightly to one side in the sand, my legs balancing against the soft angle. I picked up my tool bag and strapped it around my waist. It was far heavier out of water but I would manage. My flashlight flicked on and I joined its light with Pieter’s, thankful for the width of the beam. As he made his way over to the sealed hatch door, I noticed Pieter’s foot scraping oddly on the grate as he went.

“You hurt? Your leg is dragging.”

“It is fine, just came out of the boot awkward. Went too quickly” I watched as he clipped his light to his chest, knelt onto the floor, and placed his hands on the hatch wheel. He set his jaw and with far more force than necessary, turned the wheel. As the latches flew open, he fell forward over the hatch, having lost his balance from the surplus of required strength. I hardly noticed then, but the door had operated perfectly, without so much as a squeak on its hinges. Pieter’s eyebrows were furrowed and his eyes far away, then he righted his respirator, and raised himself gently. He turned towards the cold abyss, and began his descent down the ladder. I followed behind.

The ladder took us down into a room filled with more dials, pipes, switches, and knobs – all growing out of the walls and slithering around each other like a writhing mass of mating snakes. As my feet touched the ground I could’ve sworn I heard a screech coming from somewhere deep in the recesses of this behemoth. I told myself it was the metal settling, or just my imagination and turned sideways, squeezing through the tangled piping. To my chagrin, Pieter was stood staring at some of the dials, muttering under his breath, sounding out mile long words as I felt a breeze up my spine. I turned my back to him, shining my flashlight down the long hallway, catching a glimpse of a few crates and little else. Below us the grate flooring gave way to a shadowy generator room, and below that, empty void.

I jumped as Pieter’s hand touched my shoulder. Unphased he continued to shimmy by me until he was leading his way into the bow of the ship. He stood in the storage room for a moment, staring at something I couldn’t make out.

“Hmm..”

“What do you see?”

“Come look for yourself” 

There, behind the empty crates, was the world's cleanest trash pile. Empty potted meat cans stacked into neat pyramids nearly reaching the ceiling. Layers of wax chocolate wrappers atop one another and tied with brown twine. Egg cartons nestled neatly into each other. Flattened flour sacks, paper salt bags, and cardboard juice containers. Pots for ground coffee, and burlap sacks that once held produce all meticulously placed among God knows what else. And amidst all of it, to my utter confusion, not a stale crumb or rotten morsel to be found. Sure, eighty years would've left any remaining food shriveled, and disgusting, but the stuff couldn't have evaporated into thin air, right? Pieter bent down near the old chocolate wrappers with a soft grunt. He craned his head, peering around, then looked at me and shook his head.

“Not a bite to eat”

“Oh man, what if the crew didn't suffocate? What if they had an oxygen generator down here?”

“Not possible. Submarines did not get electrolysis machines until the late fifties”

“I’m not sure what that is”

“It pulls air out of the saltwater, Nazis were gone over a decade by then.”

“What if they really did figure out some super technology and used that instead?”

“Then they wouldn’t have lost.” I shut up, and stared ahead as Pieter took a picture with a handheld waterproof camera. Something glinted amongst the collection, and I approached for a better look. Behind a small column made of square tins lay what, at first glance, seemed to be a hoard of coins. I picked one up and realized my error. The small loop on the back revealed they were instead brass buttons. Hundreds of the things spilled over one another, the only assemblage not crafted with care. On the face of each one stood an anchor. It was odd, but I figured Pieter would notice it on his own. Pieter seemed set on using some of our film here, so I started out ahead of my partner further towards the back of the ship. 

The next room over seemed to be a medical bay of sorts – beds and cabinets lined the walls and, while still claustrophobic, it felt like more space than they would ever need. Worse than that, it felt untouched as if it hadn’t felt the decades at all. The rust I could see was minimal, and there was a distinct lack of dust, though I supposed, with no crew around to shed dead skin there wouldn’t have been much anyway. I focused my attention and opened a drawer, hoping maybe for some bandages to help wrap Pieter’s ankle, but they had all rotted long ago, the rolls crumbling into brittle chunks as I grabbed them. Behind a desk in the corner loomed a metal cabinet. I wormed my way over, my hips threading between bed frames and low shelving, and opened the top drawer. Twenty or so files organized by name. I pulled out the file labeled “Ehrman D.” and laid it out on the desk as Pieter walked in. Bold letters on top read 

“**DANIEL EHRMAN MATROSENGEFRIETER, 23.**”  

and in the corner, handwritten in red ink,

“VERSTORBEN” Pieter sniffed as his eyes followed the lines. I spoke up

“What does it say?”

“Ehhhh… regular crewman, asthmatic, broke his arm on another boat in forty-three. Just medical stuff”

“And the red? Vee- veer-”

“Verstorben. Means dead.”

“Ah… Guess we already knew that”

“Though he probably died before the sinking, no reason to document it afterward.” I nodded at this, pulling out my own camera and taking a picture of the yellowed paper as Pieter moved to the cabinet to pull more of the files out. He set down a large stack and shivered ever so slightly. The undersuits we were in insulated us well but the chill was beginning to set in all the same. We didn’t have much longer before we started risking hypothermia, and Pieter knew that well. I watched as he quickly opened a stack of the files, but my attention was wrenched down the dark corridor by a sound.

Rhythmic, bone-rattling clangs rolled towards us from deep within the ship. My mind raced: An animal hitting the hull? The dying throes of some ancient machine accidentally turned on by one of us? Maybe Command sent down a rescue squad for some unknown emergency. And then it stopped, the echoes of the metallic din raked my chest for a moment longer”

“What the fuck?” I whipped around and faced Pieter, but he wasn’t looking at the door, he stared right at me. Below him, on the desk, lay the open files, all of them with the same red ink on the corner. I hissed at him

“We need to figure out what that is and get the hell out of here” It was his turn to nod silently. Slowly, achingly so, we made our way towards the door. Pieter’s foot plodded awkwardly and we tried to keep our eyes away from the strange trash piles as we crept through the storage room. We had just begun squeezing our way through the tangle of pipes beneath our entry point when the sound began again, louder this time. We looked at one another and I knew it was better for me to take the lead, I could move faster against the tilt than he could. Strange blocks of machinery filled the next room, wisps of diesel still seeping out of them and into my nose long after they’d last run. Amalgamations of copper, bronze, and nickel reflected the flashlight back at me. 

Crossing again through a doorway we came into a long open room. Chained from the ceiling down the length of the center and both walls, were three dozen beds. In the corner opposite to us was a ladder leading down. There, on those beds, was the crew of U-897. Their bones lay composed upon their beds, milky white from the lack of exposure. There were no oxygen tanks on the floor, nor were the men’s bones covered with clothing or sheets. Folded neatly, and squarely by the pillow of each bed was a Kriegsmarine uniform. Set atop each pile was an emergency artificial lung. Thinking back, there were no leather items, the men’s jackets and boots notably missing from their beds. My light flashed through the grate below our feet and I found the same situation doubled below us. 

Had the men simply stripped naked, laid down, and suffocated? I tried to meet Pieter’s eyes to gauge his reaction, but his gaze fell miles from where we stood. The cold must have been getting to him by this point, and the tilt of the floor made moving on his ankle all the more troublesome. There was no time left to take in the sights – documentation and manifests could be taken by the next team. My job now was to satisfy Pieter’s curiosity, and get him back up top before his lips went blue or he hurt himself worse.

The clanging grew ear-splittingly loud as we approached, and again ceased. My pace was quick to the next threshold, my socks dampening the sound of my footfall. A dining area  stretched between rooms with a latrine in the corner, and booths for eating lined across the walls. Whatever was making that sound waited for me past this doorway. Grabbing the rim of the doorway, I turned into the next room. 

There, with a hammer raised to strike the metal floor once more, knelt a gangly, ash-pale, naked man. I could see his back expand as he breathed. I said nothing, frozen. He noticed my light, and his head turned slowly over his shoulder as he raised himself off of his knees. Bringing an arm out to shield himself from the bright beam of my flashlight, he squinted. Eons passed as the pale man realized exactly what he was seeing. I couldn’t shout, or run, or piss myself, or breathe. I could only exist under his stare as some specimen.

“*...i…dr...in…*”

I stood stunned as his figure continued to grow upwards, stretching higher towards the ceiling. Dwarfing me by two, three, now four heads. His thin parchment skin stretched taut against his ribcage, crackling as he shifted his weight. The man’s eyes opening now from their squint, stretching wider and wider – pale blue-grey irises pierced through me. His mouth opened wide, thick drool falling from the corners of his ashen lips.

“*Ei…dr…inge*”

My God it was his voice, he was trying to talk! The rust on his vocal chords garbled any meaning he tried to convey. Now, hunching from the height of the ceiling, the pale man loomed above me. His shoulders extended farther than proportion should have allowed, and his thin spindly arms fell away from the light as he dropped his hammer. Sharp, gnarled, amber nails grew from the end of each finger. His-- no, ‘its’ bare foot lifted then from the grate below it and the figure took a single step towards me. 

\*CRASH\* from behind and I was ripped from my stupor. Pieter had followed me through the bulkhead and in a start at the scene before me, had dropped his flashlight, shattering the bulb. The thing roared:

*“****EINDRINGLINGE!****”*

It charged for the two of us now, arms outstretched, bony appendages dislocated into grotesque angles. Its feet shook the floor beneath us as I dove away from its grasp. Pieter, on his bad leg, desperately tried to hobble back through the doorway, but was not quick enough. Wrapping both hands around Pieter’s midsection, the pale man reared back, and threw him hard against the wall. Pieter’s body crumpled onto the floor, head rolling freely on his neck. That thing turned away from us and, sprinting away from where we had come from, shouted again.

***""EINDRINGLINGE!"" ""EINDRINGLINGE!""*** 

Jumping to my feet now I pushed the metal hatch shut behind the monster and spun the wheel to lock it. The pounding of its feet grew fainter and then stopped. God only knew what it was doing now. Shouts continued to ring throughout the ship.",2,1761393841.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1ofpsol,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1ofpsol/being_kind_will_cost_you_so_much_later/,Being kind will cost you so much later.,"My cousin (working) asked if she could stay at our condo again a week since she’s from the province. I was honestly hesitant.. the last time she stayed, she never cleaned up after herself, as if we were her helpers following her mess around. And to think, she wasn’t even paying a single cent. She once left her used plate unwashed for three days.

We even offered to drive her to the airport when she went home before. Her flight was at 8 PM, and by 6 PM, she was still at a coffee shop. I called to warn her about the EDSA traffic, and instead of being thankful, she got annoyed because she was in a meeting and wag daw sya madaliin.. as if it was somehow my fault. I just let it slide and told her to book grab nalang. 

So when she insisted on staying again, I was hesitant but decided to give her another chance since she promised to help with chores. I even told her, “Just vacuum your side.. the area you stay in.” Yet, even that seemed like such a big deal for her. Same story again, no cleaning, no initiative, no effort.

What’s worse, she doesn’t even bother to offer a drink or a snack, even when she’s out getting Starbucks almost every day. But when it’s time for me and my partner to eat, she’s always there, just eating away. And every time she’s on a call, she casually refers to the condo as “my condo” not “my cousin’s condo.” Like, excuse me? Since when did ownership change?

Then came influenza season. I warned her to take it easy and stop going out too much because I might catch something. Of course, she didn’t listen. She got the flu and as expected, I caught it from her too. I told her I wasn’t feeling well, hoping she’d show some concern, but all she said was, “Nag-chills ka ba, girl? Same.” I mean, seriously? How clueless can you be?

She didn’t offer medicine, food, or even to take me to the hospital. I ended up being confined at St. Luke’s, and only after finding out I was admitted did she message, asking if she could visit. Like, hell no.

Gala responsibly. Because honestly, it’s people like her who make you regret being kind in the first place. Not that I’m keeping tabs, but a little consideration would’ve gone a long way. Is it really that hard to be mindful?

They always say, “Be the bigger person,” but how can you, when you’re constantly dealing with someone who takes advantage of every ounce of kindness you give? Some people really need to learn the difference between being hosted and being a freeloader.

If you're interested in pics that I find weren't decent quality enough for this board, some are available on the game's discord. No talking is allowed just yet; I'm working 5 hours a day on the game and work 3 jobs, so I have no time to mod the server. When I find someone to, then yeah I might set up a general...   
[https://discord.gg/Z7gxDj6YZF](https://discord.gg/Z7gxDj6YZF)

**But honestly just chat here on** r/blocktales**, the mods here are great**

# What platform?

It's going to be a **browser-based MMO**, so **anything with a web browser**. It will also be **available as an executable.**  
  
Yes, you will also be **able to play offline,** and yes**, your progress will save to your device in case of an internet outage mid-boss.**

# Modding support and open source?

Yes; there will be a user-friendly modding toolkit, and the project will be OS upon completion.

# How will multiplayer work on a modded game?

If you used the modkit, it should work with the basegame \[Basically Castle Crasher's Painter Boss Paradise but for characters, cards, items,,,, MAYBE levels or dialog\]. if you made changes with the source code, just make a fork, compile, and send it off to whoever you want to play with.

# Can I romance X character?

Probably not (for a while), not the main focus and probably doesn't fit thematically. If the game gets published, something like that would be a post-patch. You could also just make a mod.

# So there's a login system or something? Isn't that dangerous?

No, there's not.  
  
Your game data is **automatically saved to your web browser**. You may also **opt to save your data to your desktop/digital storage media as a (SaveFileName).BT file (USB, SD, Etc.)** and upload it to load your data on any other device.  
  
**I** have no plans to stop you from modifying your save data; this is essentially a single-player game with multiplayer attached, so cheating is not a bannable offense. If someone in your server is clearly using cheats, you can always just leave the party or go solo... or, you could also just :votekick

# Who's working on the project?

Code, art, music, writing, audio, and animation are being worked on by myself, some voice talents from the community; as of this post only chaoticscreech, although she might make some animations or writing work in the future, not sure currently.

# How is all this being funded?

My 3 jobs and many cups of coffee.  
  
Block Tales serves so much value without a single microtransaction and that has been pretty inspiring to keep pushing forward. I won't bee taking donations for a long while. In the future, if there are original characters made for future chapters, maybe a tee shirt or something, who knows.

I faced massive logistical resistance (late-night, unfamiliar city, set refused her place). I adapted the plan in real time, escalating from a 30-min date to pulling her to my society's isolated basement parking. Executed my first-ever car lay (in a tiny Kwid) despite her being in a relationship.

The main lesson: adapting your lay plan is key.

The report 👇🏼

THE MEET:
Now finally, after 2-3 hilarious incidents, which if you guys want me to tell about, I can tell you guys, we finally met. I had parked my car outside her society's gate and strolled for 2-3 minutes before we met. When we met, we both had a strong smile; she was wearing a sexy top, which again gave me a strong signal that she unconsciously wants the lay to happen.

Now we sat in my car. I played my seductive playlist, which I play on dates, & ran my game. She was loving my presence. I couldn't get beer because by the time I reached her it was 10 already, and all the thekas were closed. I didn't know the venue where I met her well enough, so honestly I didn't know how and where to logistically escalate, but I had a vague plan.

My plan was to verbally and physically escalate in the car and the lead her to her place. But 5-10 minutes in of her loving my presence, she herself suggested to get coffee, honestly that idea didn't cross my mind because it was 10 and unconsciously I though every shop will be closed plus I also wanted to lead it to lay fast.

If the set suggests a logistical escalation that ADDS to the lay plan directly or indirectly then one must do it. We drove to the Spectrum Mall, as we were heading to the McD she suggested to get hot chocolate from Barista instead, I teased her saying ""we may have it only if we'll share aur tum mera juthe khane se addict nahi hogi ;)"" she loved it.

We gave the order, sat down across each other and I set the timer for 30 minutes. Now this traditional date is absolutely crucial but it should not be for more than 30 minutes because 30 minutes are more than enough to gauge her and build foundations for pulling. Which I did. She was loving my banter, laughing like a little girl and getting her eyes watery.

I realised I need to increase more of the seduction eneregy instead of the bantery one now and I started doing kino. She was receptive, easily giving me her hand, letting me play with her fingers, set her hair etc. I checked the timer and it was nearing 30 minutes, I lead her saying ""let's go"", I paid and we left.

As we were walking to my car, she got a cigarette and had it outside my car leaning on it's bonet beside me. I softly held her by her waist, moved her towards and we smoothly got our skins in contact strongly. I could feel she unconsciously wants the lay and I knew that now I must escalate on her neck when we go inside the car. She finsihed her cigarette, we got in my car, I vibed for 2-3 minutes.

Now I started escalating, set her hair, got her close to me, made her rest her head on my shoulder. Now I started licking her delicious and smooth shoulders softly, she was loving it, I increased intensity and licked, sucked and kissedd on more areas. She was getting turned on as I was getting near her neck and setting her hair. As I got the right aim, I went hard on her neck, licking, sucking and kissing it. Turning her on.

She loved it but pushed me away when I went for kiss. I pulled back for 1-2 minutes and continued again the same sequence but this time more intense, went for kiss again, got pushed away. Pulled back again for 1-2 minutes and went at it again and kissed her this time. She got super turned on, started sucking on my tongue, swalloing my saliva and what not. After 2-3 minutes, I pulled back. 

The road was getting a bit busy suddenly and I decided to find a spot. I usually run dates and pull in Delhi so I don't know much about Noida though I live here but I was trying my best. After 10-15 minutes of not being able to find a spot, I parked my car near her society's gate as at least that was bit isolated. Now we made out harder this time, earlier she was bit hesitant in public but now she was feeling safe.

And despite me feeling bit shy now in public she was all over me. Anyway I pulled back again and said that I need to use her washroom, she knew the trick, she literally pointed out a public washroom and said you can go there lol. I didn't know what to do now so I ran more game and more physical escalation turning her on super hard. But still she was super resistant on going to her place.

I tried hard leading by turning off the car, getting out, she got out too but still no. I realised her being turned on and still not letting me go to her place must be because of some serious reason. I live in Noida too so I told her that we're going to my society's basement 2 parking. She was bit hesitant, this was the only thing coming to my mind to actually lay. I'll fuck her in my tiny bitch ass car.

She said she's hungry, perfect moment to drive near to my society in name of finding a food shop. Along the way to the food shop, she kissed me out of nowhere, I kinda scolded her because its not safe while driving but that turned her on lowkey lol. Finally she got something to eat and I was still running my mind how the fuck am I gonna lay her.

But anyway I trust myself and process, I drove the car to my society's basement 2 which is isolated good enough. I found a spot, parked my car, though I should've reversed park. Now we made out the hardest, no one to see, in my car as seductive music was playing. I sucked on her tits, licked her wherever I could turning her super on, she was moaning. The car is small its Renault's Kwid so I couldn't escalate much.

We've never had sex in car, especially me because I've been mainly working on building the skillset of doing hotel pulls which I believe I've built good enough as of now. But pulling in car? I had no clue. Now I didn't know how to get her into the back seat to have sex. And then it simply clicked me to do the hard lead. I told her in a strong commanding way ""get in the backseat"" and I got out of the car for backseat.

She followed my command. Us both now in backseat and doing ever harder makeouts and what not. I had a firm grip on her and went straight into her panties. As I was slowly stimulating her pussy she was making it easy for me to get inside more to the point I was fingering her rough. As I was running my fingers I whispered in her ears ""you want it"", ""you want my dick inside you"" etc.

And after a short while she herself whispered ""fuck me"". I pulled down my pyjamas and she pulled down hers, I got her on top, fucked her in cowgirl rough. We both got exhausted pretty quick maybe because of the short space. We both clearly wanted more and as she was about to wear her pyjama back. I pulled her legs, got her on her back, spread her legs and went inside her smooth and fast.

Now I went all in, I gave 0 fucks of us getting caught and though because of small space I couldn't last long as my knees and shins were getting bruised but I made sure that those 15-20 minutes that I fuck her, I fuck the brains outta her. She was moaning like crazy. Anyway we both got exhausted as fuck and then we simply wore back our clothes.

I drove her back to her place ans she STILL didn't let me go to her place for us to fuck more. She was super sleepy and tired but she still didn't let me lead to her place and that made me strongly feel that there must've be something really serious that even after sex she isn't taking me. Anyway I dropped her, we made out one last time. I came back home and of course got scolded the shit outta me.

So used to at this point that I registered absolutely nothing lol anyway it was all worth it in the end. An important pieces of information though I live with my family so I couldn't pull her at my home, instead chose to do so in my car that too in my society's basement.

This is a primary reason as to why not only do I mostly game in Delhi, try to lay there but also worked on building the skillset of hotel pulling first. But anyway until then... onto... the... NEXT!

WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST:
That how effective can simply making a lay plan fast, no matter how clunky and uncertain it is can be. I had no clue about the venue but simply making the lay plan right on the spot and STICKING to it made this lay possible in my opinion despite one of the strongest factor in game not being in my favor i.e. logistics.

THINGS TO IMPROVE SECTION:
- Build a lay/pull plan for Noida. The city isn't that big plus it has too many isolated spots that can be leveraged using car.
- Build system for car pulls, integrate and leverage them from now on whenever possible.

TEXTING TO MEET:
Surprisingly, she wasn't as bitchy, holding her ""I am hot shit"" frame on texts, but that doesn't mean she was making it easy for me. She was still making it hard for me to meet. I have gone through this so much that it doesn't bother me, and I simply do my job, try to get sets out, and ping when they ghost me. I did the same with her, though she didn't ghost me, but she was passively making it hard for me to meet her.

It's normal, and I am used to it; it's often a test from sets to gauge us. Finally we agreed to meet yesterday at DLF Mall of India around 9 PM-ish. I suggested meeting around 7 PM-ish, but she suggested 9, saying that she leaves her office late and will come directly there.

Honestly, this was a green signal because if a set wants to meet you this late after a hectic office day, she most probably unconsciously wants the lay to happen. I took this green light as a strong window of opportunity, and I knew for sure that whatever happens tonight, I am not leaving without my dick inside her. Finally, after some back-and-forth communication on texts, we agreed that I'll bring beer near to her place and we'll have it in my car.

Plans changed so much because I got so busy doing daygame that I didn't see her texts; she got a bit pissed and went straight to her home from the office instead of coming to DLF.

THE INITIAL APPROACH:
Ironically, when I approached this set (let's call her A) at the HK station, I was heading to meet a set for D2 (let's call her T), whom just the day before I had made out with aggressively in public. I failed to bounce T to a venue where I could easily lead her to the pull venue, and just after that, I same-day laid a set (let's call her Y). 

And the day when I approached A and was headed to meet T for D2 after a same-day lay fail, I STILL failed to lay with her despite pulling her lol. Anyway, coming to the initial interaction with A, I saw her enjoying ice cream, standing peacefully in a corner. I got pulled to her energy because her energy seemed potent, intense, and sexual, something I unconsciously get attracted to.

She was wearing shorts making her thighs look delicious, her breasts really firm and her curves really tight. All this made me turned on, I knew am gonna approach her no matter what. HK station being HK was crowded, after 2-3 minutes I reached upto her, opened, she didn't got hooked enough. She was focused on her ice-cream.

She was holding her frame that I get hit on all the time, I am hot shit etc. and I held my frame, I kept running my game, now she was hooked, smiling but trying to hide the fact that she's enjoying my interaction. I realised she's into me but she's shy because she's trying hard to hold her frame plus she's not able to make and hold eye contact.

As told above I had to meet T and she said she's waiting to meet her BF and cousin. So after 2-3 minutes I cut the interaction short, closed her and left. Honestly this is a very common interaction for me at least so I wasn't expecting much from A and at that moment and days after that I was more mentally occupied with my same-day lay and D2 lay fails with T.",1,1761393334.0,PickUpArtist,1,1.0,False

To say the right things, cry the right amount, and then drink coffee pretending everything is “beautifully arranged.”

Everyone wears the same “appropriate” black clothing, the same polished expressions, like grief has a dress code.
Even sorrow has to look professional now, as if there’s a LinkedIn bowtie wrapped around death itself.

But real grief doesn’t fit into that.
It’s messy, silent, disorganized.

Funerals don’t help that.
They make it worse by turning death into a social event, where you have to mask, dress, and act in a certain way instead of simply feeling.

It’s not about the dead anymore.
It’s about image control, politeness, and the illusion of your personal professionalism like you're selling a brand and that brand is you.

Maybe some people find comfort in it.
But for me, it feels unhealthy, invasive, and traumatizing, like grief is being packaged and sold back to us by the funeral industry in a Louis Vuitton box.

So yesterday, after I was done cleaning, I went straight to my office room, where I stayed till the end of the day (with poop breaks every hour). I was so embarrassed that I wanted to avoid everyone. When I finished my job, I headed to my car. I was surprised when I noticed only a few cars in the parking lot. That was very unusual, but I thought it was because it was Friday.
Today I wanted to meet up with my boss as soon as possible, so I came at the same time as he usually arrives (6:30-7:00). But when I went to his office, he was nowhere to be found. I saw his assistant, Clair (fake name). She looked up from her laptop and was shocked to see me.
I asked her about the boss, and she told me that he is sick, some stomach issues, and he is not the only one. Apparently half of our company felt sick yesterday. I asked:

 - What happened?
 - Oh, you know exactly what happened - and she smirked.

""Holy shit, did I bring some stomach virus?"" I thought. She noticed my confusion and added that everyone had the same issue as me, and some people went home early yesterday because our toilet was occupied due to my shitty accident. Which explains why there were fewer cars in the parking lot yesterday.
I asked her if the boss is still mad at me because of that. She laughed and told me that I have nothing to worry about and it was Rob's fault (also a fake name).
Rob was this 18-year-old intern, son of a boss's friend, who was ""helping"" the customer care team. I wrote ""helping"" because he wasn't doing shit. Always late, always rude, and very entitled. The day before my shitty accident, he was yelling at the customers that they were stupid idiots for not understanding our return policy, and he (Rob) didn't have time for their bullshit. He was fired on the spot, obviously. He was extremely mad and told our boss he will regret this. Apparently he was here yesterday morning demanding to be rehired, but the boss didn't yield. And that was it. Or so we thought.
Clair told me that her brother, who is working as a doorman in our company, met Rob at the bar. He was drinking with his friends and bragging about how he took his revenge on his old job. This motherfucker added tasteless laxatives to the water tank in our coffee machine and to the coffee grinder.
I was speechless. The only unaffected people were those who drank tea that day. Boss already knows about Rob's actions and wants to sue him for harming others.
As for my case, I don't think my boss is angry at me anymore, so I'll not lose my job because of the unflushable shit I left yesterday.

TL;DR: A fired intern added laxatives to the coffee machine, which caused stomach problems for me and my boss",33,1761393202.0,tifu,10,0.9,False

Now this traditional date is absolutely crucial but it should not be for more than 30 minutes because 30 minutes are more than enough to gauge her and build foundations for pulling. Which I did.

I live in Noida too so I told her that we're going to my society's basement 2 parking. She was bit hesitant, this was the only thing coming to my mind to actually lay. I'll fuck her in my tiny bitch ass car.

She said she's hungry, perfect moment to drive near to my society in name of finding a food shop. Along the way to the food shop, she kissed me out of nowhere, I kinda scolded her because its not safe while driving but that turned her on lowkey lol. Finally she got something to eat and I was still running my mind how the fuck am I gonna lay her.

But anyway I trust myself and process, I drove the car to my society's basement 2 which is isolated good enough. I found a spot, parked my car, though I should've reversed park. Now we made out the hardest, no one to see, in my car as seductive music was playing. I sucked on her tits, licked her wherever I could turning her super on, she was moaning. The car is small its Renault's Kwid so I couldn't escalate much.

We've never had sex in car, especially me because I've been mainly working on building the skillset of doing hotel pulls which I believe I've built good enough as of now. But pulling in car? I had no clue. Now I didn't know how to get her into the back seat to have sex. And then it simply clicked me to do the hard lead. I told her in a strong commanding way ""get in the backseat"" and I got out of the car for backseat.

She followed my command. Us both now in backseat and doing ever harder makeouts and what not. I had a firm grip on her and went straight into her panties. As I was slowly stimulating her pussy she was making it easy for me to get inside more to the point I was fingering her rough. As I was running my fingers I whispered in her ears ""you want it"", ""you want my dick inside you"" etc.

And after a short while she herself whispered ""fuck me"". I pulled down my pyjamas and she pulled down hers, I got her on top, fucked her in cowgirl rough. We both got exhausted pretty quick maybe because of the short space. We both clearly wanted more and as she was about to wear her pyjama back. I pulled her legs, got her on her back, spread her legs and went inside her smooth and fast.

Now I went all in, I gave 0 fucks of us getting caught and though because of small space I couldn't last long as my knees and shins were getting bruised but I made sure that those 15-20 minutes that I fuck her, I fuck the brains outta her. She was moaning like crazy. Anyway we both got exhausted as fuck and then we simply wore back our clothes.

I drove her back to her place ans she STILL didn't let me go to her place for us to fuck more. She was super sleepy and tired but she still didn't let me lead to her place and that made me strongly feel that there must've be something really serious that even after sex she isn't taking me. Anyway I dropped her, we made out one last time. I came back home and of course got scolded the shit outta me.

So used to at this point that I registered absolutely nothing lol anyway it was all worth it in the end. An important pieces of information though I live with my family so I couldn't pull her at my home, instead chose to do so in my car that too in my society's basement.

This is a primary reason as to why not only do I mostly game in Delhi, try to lay there but also worked on building the skillset of hotel pulling first. But anyway until then... onto... the... NEXT!

WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST:
That how effective can simply making a lay plan fast, no matter how clunky and uncertain it is can be. I had no clue about the venue but simply making the lay plan right on the spot and STICKING to it made this lay possible in my opinion despite one of the strongest factor in game not being in my favor i.e. logistics.

THINGS TO IMPROVE SECTION:
- Build a lay/pull plan for Noida. The city isn't that big plus it has too many isolated spots that can be leveraged using car.
- Build system for car pulls, integrate and leverage them from now on whenever possible.

TEXTING TO MEET:
Surprisingly, she wasn't as bitchy, holding her ""I am hot shit"" frame on texts, but that doesn't mean she was making it easy for me. She was still making it hard for me to meet. I have gone through this so much that it doesn't bother me, and I simply do my job, try to get sets out, and ping when they ghost me. I did the same with her, though she didn't ghost me, but she was passively making it hard for me to meet her.

It's normal, and I am used to it; it's often a test from sets to gauge us. Finally we agreed to meet yesterday at DLF Mall of India around 9 PM-ish. I suggested meeting around 7 PM-ish, but she suggested 9, saying that she leaves her office late and will come directly there.

Honestly, this was a green signal because if a set wants to meet you this late after a hectic office day, she most probably unconsciously wants the lay to happen. I took this green light as a strong window of opportunity, and I knew for sure that whatever happens tonight, I am not leaving without my dick inside her. Finally, after some back-and-forth communication on texts, we agreed that I'll bring beer near to her place and we'll have it in my car.

Plans changed so much because I got so busy doing daygame that I didn't see her texts; she got a bit pissed and went straight to her home from the office instead of coming to DLF.

THE INITIAL APPROACH:
Ironically, when I approached this set (let's call her A) at the HK station, I was heading to meet a set for D2 (let's call her T), whom just the day before I had made out with aggressively in public. I failed to bounce T to a venue where I could easily lead her to the pull venue, and just after that, I same-day laid a set (let's call her Y). 

And the day when I approached A and was headed to meet T for D2 after a same-day lay fail, I STILL failed to lay with her despite pulling her lol. Anyway, coming to the initial interaction with A, I saw her enjoying ice cream, standing peacefully in a corner. I got pulled to her energy because her energy seemed potent, intense, and sexual, something I unconsciously get attracted to.

She was wearing shorts making her thighs look delicious, her breasts really firm and her curves really tight. All this made me turned on, I knew am gonna approach her no matter what. HK station being HK was crowded, after 2-3 minutes I reached upto her, opened, she didn't got hooked enough. She was focused on her ice-cream.

She was holding her frame that I get hit on all the time, I am hot shit etc. and I held my frame, I kept running my game, now she was hooked, smiling but trying to hide the fact that she's enjoying my interaction. I realised she's into me but she's shy because she's trying hard to hold her frame plus she's not able to make and hold eye contact.

As told above I had to meet T and she said she's waiting to meet her BF and cousin. So after 2-3 minutes I cut the interaction short, closed her and left. Honestly this is a very common interaction for me at least so I wasn't expecting much from A and at that moment and days after that I was more mentally occupied with my same-day lay and D2 lay fails with T.",1,1761393194.0,daygame,0,1.0,False

Since then I’ve made some adjustments which have made life more liveable, bit boring but liveable.

1) Sticking to super safe diet (kiwi, fresh grilled chicken/fish, roast potatoes, basmati rice, boiled veg, porridge, eggs, honey, kefir, small black coffee in morning) with 0 deviation.
2) Forcing self to do weigh training but now doing 1/3rd of the length/intensity of the session
3) Taking fexofenadine, seems to have made the biggest difference for both mental and weird body reactions. Think PFS, covid etc absolutely wreck your gut health, which then can lead to histamine intolerance / MCAS. Jumping on fexofenadine has allowed the mental chaos to quieten a bit, as well the weird physical stuff like tremoring, glitching, spasming out of control. In particular it’s made it so showers stop giving me panic attacks. 

I don’t plan to be on fexofenadine forever, just until I reach a good baseline, where I feel more confident in my food reactions and ability to do full workouts, including HIIT and cardio.

Hopefully the above might help some in here feel a bit better, I will say though if you have a condition like chronic sibo then even the above diet might be too much, need to get rid of that sibo first. 

Edit: I could tell that covid worsened my gut because I started shitting out demons for like 3/4 days and became almost allergic to most foods. The hope is that the Covid bit is transient at least and not a permanent worsening of the baseline ",2,1761392780.0,FinasterideSyndrome,0,0.75,False

1ofpc20,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1ofpc20/my_sugar_free_experience_so_far/,My sugar free experience so far,"I stopped eating added sugars and sweeteners for two months (with one exception), and it's been mind-blowing.

So, a bit of a preface: sugar is something I've wanted to stop eating for a long time. When I was young, my father, who's a nutritionist, completely quit added sugar. To this day, he has kept it up, and he always told me that his cravings went away. So, I knew it was something that was possible to do and be fine. However, my parents never limited my sugar intake, and I grew up eating a lot of sweets.

When I started high school, I got much more into nutrition and fitness and started reading a lot of books specifically about quitting sugar. I read this one book, Year of No Sugar, where a family quits all added sugar and sweeteners with the exception of eating one dessert per month. I really wanted to try it; however, at the same time, I was going through a lot of changes in my life. I was so used to using sugary foods as a way to cope that just the idea of quitting seemed impossible.

Several years have gone by, and I realized I'm, to some extent, obsessed with sugar. I've made a lot of changes to my diet, and I wasn't eating sugary sweets all the time; however, whenever I was having a bad day, it felt impossible to limit myself. I was also using sugar as a sort of boost throughout the day to get through minor inconveniences, and I wanted to stop.

Another thing about me is that I'm very competitive, and so is my sister. She found herself with a similar problem, so we decided to do a challenge and quit added sugar and sweeteners together, with the exception that at the end of each month, we can eat one dessert. That aspect helped a lot because whenever I craved something, instead of thinking, ""Oh, I can never eat this again,"" it was, ""Oh, I just have to wait until the end of the month.""

The first two weeks were really hard. I was thinking about sugar all day long. However, after that, it got much easier. I would eat some fruit as a snack or a dessert, and while at first it didn't really help because all I wanted was ice cream and chocolate, fruit became a satisfying replacement as I got used to not eating those things.

I'm now around two months free from sugar, and here's what I noticed taste-wise:

· Milk and dairy are much sweeter. Adding some milk to my coffee makes it taste sweet to me.
· Fruit tastes sweeter and more complex. Maybe it's just that I've been getting some good fruit, but I've noticed that things like berries, melon, and pineapple have a more unique flavor than before.

Mentally, I'm much more at peace. This was the most surprising thing for me. I knew the cravings would lessen, but I didn't think they would do so so quickly in such a short time. I don't think about sweets often anymore, and it's much easier to not eat them, even if everyone around me is. I also feel that I have much more energy throughout the day and that I'm more relaxed. I sleep better, my memory is somewhat sharper, and I feel so much more in control around food.

I plan to go on like this forever. I'm happy that I still eat a dessert once a month; it helps when I do get infrequent strong cravings. Also, I really do like sugar, and I think that once a month isn't bad. For me, the dessert is much more enjoyable because it's something I've thought through and planned, and I don't feel out of control when I eat it, so I get to enjoy it mentally as well.

Anyway, I just wanted to share. Had I known that the strong cravings would lessen so quickly, I probably would've quit much sooner.

1ofp7eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/1ofp7eg/preparing_for_snap_cuts_why_i_made_a_link_page_to/,Preparing for SNAP Cuts: Why I Made a Link Page to Accept Support,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share something I put together recently in case SNAP benefits get cut or delayed. Like many of you, I rely on food banks, but the food they provide often isn’t enough-not enough fresh or protein-rich foods, and a lot of it ends up stale, outdated, or spoiled. It’s not something you can really build meals around.

Because of that, I set up a simple “link page” (using Biolink, but you can also use Milkshake or Linktree) where I gathered all my ways people can support me with money-Cash App, Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, and others- all in one place. I’ve also included my Amazon Wish List, specifically a public list called “Essentials,” which covers basic things I need monthly like dish soap, toilet paper, oatmeal, and some foods that are cheaper on Amazon than at the grocery store.

I want to be clear-I’m absolutely not comfortable doing this. I’ve never asked for help before, not from family or friends. But these are really extreme, unsafe circumstances. That’s why I created this page: to prepare if I need to ask for mutual aid support from friends, family, or anyone willing to help during this tough time.

I’m grateful for any support I get and will gladly give back however I can in return, whether it’s work or other help.
I want to encourage others who might be facing the same uncertainties to get their support links set up and ready so when you do need help, it’s easier to share.

The food banks won’t cover all our needs, especially if SNAP cuts happen. We deserve real food we can make meals from, not out is date canned beans and spoiled vegetables, half the time.

If you’re thinking about how you’ll get by, maybe try making your own link page. It’s a small step, but it can make a big difference.",0,1761391765.0,foodstamps,0,0.5,False

I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee. I oftentimes think out loud.

That there won’t necessarily be a “later,” “a moment when things change,” “a meeting with the right one.”

I was never in a relationship during my teenage years or even after. I wasn’t attractive enough for girls to come to me like they did with some of my friends, and I never figured out how to seduce like others did.
Around the age of 22/23, luckily, things changed a bit and I started getting more attention. I had a few « love stories ». They never lasted more than 2–3 months. And even though I’ve never really been in a “relationship,” in the sense of something with a talk, a label and a medium- to long-term perspective, I’ve had several fairly similar stories that lasted for a few months but felt really intense and passionate on the moment.

At that time, I started a job that made me move abroad, I traveled a bit, and without really knowing why, I suddenly interested some women. Maybe it was the fact to be foreign exotic, the French accent, or something like that. Or simply the fact that by doing things I wanted to do, I was a bit happier and therefore more attractive.

That’s for my dating background, more or less. Nothing for a long time and a few short stories/ situationships after.

Then two and a half years ago, I came back to France. I began other studies while working in an office in a kind of internship mixed between periods of class and periods of work.  And now the possibility of experiencing anything with a woman feels impossible — in a completely pragmatic way.

To put it simply, I can’t remember the last time a woman looked at me with desire, flirted with me, or gave me any sign that she was attracted to me.

I feel like I’m back in my teenage years when girls didn’t look at me, and I watched them being interested by my friends and flirting with them while I felt invisible and like shit.

I feel lonely to a point that is sometimes painful, as if my skin were turning into scales, some crust, something hard and dry, desertlike. I don’t even remember what it feels like to feel a woman’s fingers, even on my arm. The idea of living without love, without affection, makes me sad. Same for the idea of living without a sex life — which sometimes makes me feel like a frustrated caveman and makes me ashamed, just like writing this paragraph.

I read Whatever (L’extension du domaine de la lutte in French) by Houellebecq when I was 19 or 20.  It talks about the theory of sexual misery. A thesis that now shows up among  masculinists and incels — which I find dangerous and pathetic.

It seems to me that, for the animals that we are, not fulfilling our sexual desires is unpleasant and frustrating. Or at least it can be, depending of the person I guess we all have diferent percpetions of things. But it seems legitimate to feel frustrated when you have desires that don’t meet their concretization. I certainly feel this way sometimes. But you have to be an idiot to turn it into an ideology and an injustice, to claim to be a victim (of who? of what?) and use it to fuel hate born from frustration.

I actually think that the real misery is not sexual or even romantic. Every human can use masturbation to fullfill those desires. About love, I think it happens pretty often to fall in love with someone, or a feeling close, without being with the person. You can easily have romantic feelings for someone and never be their boyfriend/ girlfriend. But tenderness, and also intimacy, connection, is the real thing that can't exist without someone else sharing it with you.

Some phrases I’ve often heard are: “It’s because you lack confidence,” or “you need to stop putting yourself down.”

I don’t think I’m doing that. At least I don’t anymore.

I’ve seen guys less good-looking than me with intelligent, sensitive, beautiful women. I’ve seen better-looking guys than me with girls who weren’t attractive and had a mean personality with nothing really interesting to say.

And about confidence, I’ve never been able to rely entirely on my looks, that’s for sure. But I don’t think I am especially a freak or unable to interact with women.

I’m not too stupid (I think I’m smarter than a lot of people I see, even if that sounds arrogant). I’m pretty funny, at least sometimes. I don’t have any macho or shitty retarted vision of what my potential girlfriend should do — telling her what to wear, what to do, who to see, etc.

Some people would probably tell me I have too high standards. I don’t think that I have. I would say I have three. Being attracted by her. Liking talking with her. That she likes me too. 

I think that it’s just normal to want to be in a relationship with someone you are attracted to and get along with.

I don’t believe in the “nice guy” myth — the « good guys finsih last »  bs.  That women prefer jerks and good guys are doomed to loneliness. In my opinion, most self-proclaimed “good guys” are not particularly kind or honorable, and claiming a supposed moral superiority seems problematic and shady.

The only thing though is that I regret telling women my zodiac sign (cancer) because I have seen many times a girl that seemed interested look at me like a poor weak thing with no sex-appeal after I told her my sign is cancer. (we have the reputation to be nice).

What’s worst is that I actually tried to meet people. I’ve signed up on dating apps like Tinder and Fruitz — even with the subscription versions and unlimited likes. And even after swiping hundreds, literally thousands of profiles to the right, I’ve had 3 or 4 matches that didn't even lead to a conversation.

Since then, I stopped using dating apps because the idea that out of 1000 women only 3 or 4 are going to swipe right on me is too destructive. Instead of making me talk or meet women it actually made the gap toward them bigger.

I’ve done activities, gone out. I’ve tried inviting women for a coffee or a drink, but most refused or never replied.

The latest example is a girl I talked to a bit, and I sent her an Instagram page of a regular event, thinking she might like it. I suggested we go together (which was the main reason I sent her the event). I even proposed a specific day so she could simply say she was busy if she wasn’t interested, without it being awkward for either of us. She replied to my message completely ignoring the part where I suggested we go together. Not even a “I’m not free that day.” Nothing. Just, basically, “Thanks for the page, I’ll check it out.”

The two dates I have been those last 2 and a half year, I felt that we were actually not into eachother mutually in both cases.

So I stopped trying because it feels even worst to try and get rejected or ignored. It happens to everyone but when it's systematical, what's the point ? Plus, I noticed that all the girls I had something with all kind of made the first step or at least gave me clear signs that they were into me. I have never been abble to seduce a woman if she didn't show me in a very clear way her interest.

All of that to say that I feel like I reached a point where I don’t know how meet a woman and interest her could happen and it scares me a lot. Especially that I don’t see any way of changing it. And I am not sure I can live my life knowing that my next 40 or 50 years will look like that.

**TL;DR:** Control Home Assistant through Siri/Action Button with shortcuts that automatically switch between voice and text based on your phone orientation and Bluetooth/CarPlay connection.

## Overview

Here is a set-up guide for a series of shortcuts I created to access Home Assistant’s Voice Assistant through Siri or your iPhone’s Action Button.

## Download Links

- [ConnectionTrue](#) - *https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5b098318065d41f19b607838ac9b6c71*
- [ConnectionFalse](#) - * https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fd5c22511bc14e2abc059d9c32eee080*
- [Assist A](#) - * https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b20f8f7548914c26a05e226471a1d774*
- [Assist B](#) - * https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63e0a9356f244604affdd877cc289558*

## Features

- Interact with Home Assistant’s Voice Assistant without opening the Home Assistant app
- Automatic voice mode when phone is face down or connected to Bluetooth/CarPlay
- Automatic text mode when phone is face up and not connected to Bluetooth/CarPlay
- Continued conversation when Home Assistant needs a response from you

## Requirements & Assumptions

**Hardware:**

- iPhone (newer model with Action Button recommended but not required)
- Home Assistant Server

**Software:**

- The Home Assistant App (web UI works, but the app is easier)
- Home Assistant Cloud (required for use outside your local network - this is the easiest way to get secure remote access)
- An AI Conversation API set up in Home Assistant (the built-in assistant works, but Claude or ChatGPT APIs are much smarter)

**Knowledge/Skills:**

- Familiarity with Home Assistant
- Familiarity with Apple Shortcuts
- Ability to follow step-by-step instructions

**Security Note:** This guide assumes you’re using Home Assistant Cloud for secure remote access. Other methods (VPN, port forwarding) require additional security considerations.

## The Shortcuts

**`ConnectionTrue`**

- Updates a note to tell the main shortcut that you’re connected to CarPlay or Bluetooth

**`ConnectionFalse`**

- Updates a note to tell the main shortcut you’re not connected to CarPlay or Bluetooth

**`Assist A`**

- Starts the conversation and handles the conversation loop

**`Assist B`**

- Contains the main conversation processing logic

-----

# Installation Instructions

## Part 1 - Bluetooth & CarPlay Detection Setup

This allows the shortcuts to automatically switch between voice and text mode based on your connection status.

1. Open the Notes app and create a new note titled `Connection Status`
1. In the body of the note, type: `FALSE`
1. Download and install `ConnectionTrue` and `ConnectionFalse`
1. Run both shortcuts once to verify they work and grant permissions
1. Open the Shortcuts app
1. Tap the **Automation** tab at the bottom
1. Create 4 personal automations by pressing the **+** button:
- **Automation 1:** When Bluetooth is connected → Run `ConnectionTrue`
- **Automation 2:** When Bluetooth is disconnected → Run `ConnectionFalse`
- **Automation 3:** When CarPlay is connected → Run `ConnectionTrue`
- **Automation 4:** When CarPlay is disconnected → Run `ConnectionFalse`
1. For each automation, make sure:
- **Run Immediately** is enabled
- **Notify When Run** is disabled

-----

## Part 2 - Gathering Your Home Assistant Information

Before configuring the shortcuts, collect these three pieces of information. I recommend copying them into a temporary note.

### 1. Your Home Assistant URL

**If using Home Assistant Cloud:**

1. Open the Home Assistant app
1. Tap the three lines (☰) to open the menu
1. Open **Settings**
1. Open **Home Assistant Cloud**
1. Scroll down to **Remote Access** and copy your URL
1. Add `/api/conversation/process` to the end of your URL
- Example: `https://your-url.ui.nabu.casa/api/conversation/process`

**If using local network only:**

- Use your Home Assistant local IP address with the same path
- Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8123/api/conversation/process`

### 2. Long-Lived Access Token

The shortcuts need this token to authenticate with Home Assistant.

1. Open the Home Assistant app
1. Tap the three lines (☰) to open the menu
1. Scroll to the bottom and tap your server name
1. Go to the **Security** tab (second page)
1. Scroll to **Long-Lived Access Tokens**
1. Tap **Create Token**
1. Name it `SmartAssist`
1. Copy the token and save it (you won’t be able to see it again!)

### 3. Your Agent ID

This tells the shortcut which conversation agent to use.

1. Open the Home Assistant app
1. Tap the three lines (☰) to open the menu
1. Open **Developer Tools**
1. Tap **States**
1. In the **Filter entities** search box, type: `conversation`
1. Look for entities starting with `conversation.`
- If you’ve never set up an external AI API, you’ll likely only see `conversation.home_assistant` - use this
- If you use Claude, ChatGPT, or another API, choose that agent (it will be named like `conversation.claude` or similar)
1. Copy the full entity name (example: `conversation.home_assistant`)

**Save all three pieces of information - you’ll need them in Part 3.**

-----

## Part 3 - Configure the Shortcuts

### Set up `Assist A`

1. Download and install `Assist A`
1. No configuration needed!
1. Run it once to grant necessary permissions

### Set up `Assist B`

1. Download and install `Assist B`
1. Open `Assist B` in the Shortcuts app for editing
1. Scroll down to the first **Dictionary** action
1. Replace `YOURAGENTID` with your agent ID from Part 2
- Example: `conversation.home_assistant`
1. Scroll down to the **Get contents of** action
1. Replace `YOURURL` with your complete URL from Part 2
- Example: `https://your-url.ui.nabu.casa/api/conversation/process`
1. In the same **Get contents of** action, tap the blue arrow (▼) to expand it
1. You’ll see **Headers** with a line that says `Bearer`
1. Replace `YOURLONGLIVEDACCESSTOKEN` with your token from Part 2
- The full line should look like: `Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...` (your token will be much longer)
1. Run `Assist B` once to grant necessary permissions

-----

## Part 4 - Using the Shortcuts

### Activation Methods

**Option 1: Action Button (iPhone 15 Pro or newer)**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Action Button**
1. Select **Shortcut**
1. Choose `Assist A`

**Option 2: Siri (any iPhone)**

- Say: “Hey Siri, run Assist A”

**Option 3: Home Screen/Widget**

- Add the shortcut to your home screen or widgets for one-tap access

### How It Works

**Voice Mode (automatic when):**

- Phone is face down, OR
- Connected to Bluetooth, OR
- Connected to CarPlay

→ Speak your command and hear the response

**Text Mode (automatic when):**

- Phone is face up, OR
- Not connected to Bluetooth, OR
- Not connected to CarPlay

→ Type your command and read the response

**Continued Conversation:**

- If Home Assistant needs more information, the shortcut will automatically prompt you to continue the conversation

Hey there!
We’re a chill couple (M27 & F35) looking to meet a fun, easygoing woman who’d be open to hanging out with us maybe grab coffee, go on late-night drives, or just vibe and see where things go.

We’re both respectful, drama-free, and looking for someone similar. No pressure or expectations just good company and honest connection.

If this sounds interesting, feel free to DM and we can take it from there 🙂",2,1761390236.0,BangaloreHouseParties,2,1.0,False

Well, we really can't take two steps in Buddhist Reddit without encountering the US pop culture understandings of Buddhism. *It informs so much of the discourse here.* In fact, it would be irresponsible *to not address it* and center it for reflection.

These understandings are *uniquely* American: informed by Orientalist academic concerns rooted in the historical contacts that the US has had with Asia: via colonialisms, imperialisms and globalisation. See Vietnam, the Philippines, China, India, Japan etc.

* The meme of Buddhism-as-Vulcan/Jedi mind training emanates from the US. See so-called Theravada and Zen subs.
* Buddhism-as-vibes is very much rooted in the monetisation of Buddhist ideas and brand building.
* Buddhism-as-medicine has historical roots in US therapeutic trends over the last 3 decades.

# Culture for thee but not for me

https://preview.redd.it/xc5jzg9sk8xf1.jpg?width=445&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=119222ddeefb2b1cdb2adab3b2e1ab745029087c

Unique to Americans is HOW they use the word culture. Culture becomes a stand-in for race and ethnicity. This is why notions like Western Buddhism for them mean white people. They don't think of Vietnamese Americans or Sri Lankan Americans *as Westerners*. 

This shows you that *they collapse race, ethnicity and culture into a single category.* 

Also uniquely American: non-White people can't really BE American.

In the English language, culture does not exclusively refer to the practices of a group of *racialised* people. 

*Culture is what humans produce simply by being.* 

We do it via shared language, ritual, stories etc established over a period of time. This is why you can get corporate culture, gym culture, coffee culture etc.

So when we reflect in this way, we can see the problems that arise when certain terms and phrases are used in Buddhist Reddit space: 

* Traditional Buddhism
* Cultural Buddhism
* Too cultural
* Western Buddhism
* Pre-sectarian Buddhism
* Early Buddhism

These terms often end up used in a discourse of power and hierarchy. We know for instance that they're **value laden** in these spaces. What I mean by that is, that they're not usually neutral categories here, they're used to contrast with notions of modernity, the urbane, sophistication etc. In contrast to the cultural, irrelevant, arcane and esoteric.

These notions sit at the foundations of the medical and therapeutic models of Buddhism developed by Americans for wealth creation. And also the Wellness Industrial Complex that secular B\_ddhist ideology forms part of.",3,1761390168.0,ReflectiveBuddhism,2,1.0,False

18F. i’m in my last year of highschool and the pressure is really getting to me. i have never been amazing in school or properly studied and have only started really studying last year. 

now, for context i have diagnosed adhd and some sort of undiagnosed heart problems. 

the issue with this combination is that i can’t be on adhd stimulating medication because my bpm goes above the roof to the point where i had some sort of hyperventilating “attack” almost every day. 

i was on ritalin for a good month or two and the effects were really bad on me, i dont know if my heart problems were pre-existing or if they were caused by the medication but they only started becoming noticeable during and after i took ritalin. 

my everyday symptoms now, include tachycardia, palpitations (often when i stand up from a seated or lying down position), sports intolerance (even though i do weekly sports), a drop in bp when standing up, rarely causing me to faint, dizziness when standing for a long period of time and more.

i have seen doctors for this but always gave up halfway through meeting them, like i got a new gp and explained my symptoms, he said it sounds like “vasogaval syncope” and probably “pots”. i never got a proper diagnosis, wasn’t offered treatment and only got advice like “drink more water” or “eat breakfast”. 

this same advice came from another gp i saw last week, who also asked if i’ve been to a cardiologist. i have, and wore a heart monitor for a day and then was told that i have an elevated heart rate, WHICH I WAS OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF!!! the cardiologist didn’t give me any advice, didnt tell me what to do for my next step and i am just so frustrated and confused and don’t want to live this way anymore.

everytime i drink coffee my heart rate is so high i could faint and i’m shaking constantly, but i dont know how else to get through school. i dont think i can pass without medication and have such a hard time concentrating, i also requested extra time on tests and the final exams which has been declined by some education department thing. 

i need help, i dont know my next step, i’m only 18 and dont know how things work with doctors and shit, i’m worried about my health, i’m worried about my education, i cant focus, what do i do? please help",1,1761390079.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1ofojkg,https://i.redd.it/yivjk5ivm8xf1.png,"V60, Specialty Style — More Extraction, No Harshness","The V60 is a benchmark in specialty coffee. The gap between an average cup and a standout brew hinges on three inputs: grind size, ratio, and pour profile. Aim for a balanced extraction where lively acidity meets sweetness and bitterness stays barely perceptible. Target a drawdown of 2:15–3:00 for most washed, medium roasts. Finer grinds raise surface area and extraction but risk clogging and bitterness; coarser grinds under-extract and taste thin.



Common working ratios sit at 1:15 to 1:16. Start with 15 g coffee to 240–250 g water at 92–96°C, adjusting upward for lighter, fresher roasts to tame acidity and highlight sweetness. Multi-pulse pours help cleanliness: bloom with 30–40 g for 30–45 s, then equal pulses to final weight while keeping a steady water level above the bed and avoiding filter abrasion.



Water chemistry matters. Mild hardness helps. Calcium and magnesium in moderate ranges enhance solubility of aromatics. Purely demineralized water yields flat cups; very hard water increases harshness. If you cannot measure minerals, choose a balanced bottled water.



Paper and gentle swirling are critical. White V60 filters often brew cleaner than brown, but rinse thoroughly. A brief swirl after each pulse evens the bed and prevents channeling. Inspect the bed: a flat surface signals uniform flow; a clean, conical bottom without heavy mud suggests proper grind. Use 18–22% extraction yield as a practical anchor via sensory checks: evaluate balance once the cup cools, as flaws show at room temperature.



Bottom line: no magic recipe. Start at 1:15.5, 94°C, 2:40 total time, equal pulse pours, light swirling. Adjust grind first, temperature second, and ratio last. This systematic approach delivers a repeatable V60 that showcases the coffee’s character instead of masking it.",1,1761389360.0,u_chemex4coffee,0,1.0,False

In one of her first cleaning videos when she returned she was folding her clean striped pool towels, so I believe she has been using her pool.""

Someone responded to me and said ""This sub is to support Emilie.  You should be banned!""  For that???  But it wasn't so funny because sure enough I got banned.

I should have screenshotted my comment, because I woke up this AM with a warning, saying I had violated the harrassment rule and could be banned from ALL Reddit subs now.  
  
WHAT??????  How is what I wrote harrassment?  Saying not to worry she couldn't face her back yard because I believed from the towels she had gone in the pool?

Context:
Na-experience n’yo na ba ‘yung ganitong kagrupo sa thesis?
‘Yung mga sobrang asikaso kuno, pero hindi naman makaintindi, tapos ang lakas pa mang-utos akala mo katulong nila ako! Sila pa ‘yung walang ginagawa. Siyempre, friends ko sila kaya minsan hindi ko rin matanggihan. Ang hirap talaga kagrupo kapag magkakaibigan, lalo na kung super close. Hindi maiwasan na magkaroon ng inis o tampuhan sa isa’t isa.

Sa grupo namin, ako lang ang hindi working, tapos lahat sila may trabaho. Eh paano naman ako? Ako na ang nag-e-edit ng lahat! Hindi pa nila magawang mag-edit sa iPhone nila kasi raw ako ang may laptop. So, kasalanan ko pa ngayon na may laptop ako? Huhu. Sana hindi na lang ako nagpa-bili! 😭

**The backstory:** I kept seeing the same pattern everywhere - friends, coworkers, random people at coffee shops - everyone has ""that app idea"" they talk about but never build.

Not because the ideas are bad. But because:

* Hiring devs = $20k-$50k (who has that?)
* Learning to code = months of tutorials (most give up)
* No-code tools = steep learning curve, still confusing AF
* So ideas just... die

This bothered me way more than it should. So nights and weekends, I started building **IdeazFlow**: [https://ideazflow.com/](https://ideazflow.com/)

**Here's how it works:**

* You share your app/website idea (free, no strings)
* I create a detailed MVP plan - features, tech approach, timeline (real human work)
* Like it? Pay **$5** to get started
* I build the initial version in under a week (AI + human expertise)
* After delivery, **you decide what it's worth**

**Why $5?** Because I want to remove every excuse. Financial risk? Gone. ""I'll do it someday.""? Not anymore. Either your idea is worth $5 or it isn't.

**The ""pay what you want after"" part?** Yeah, I might get burned. But it keeps me honest and focused on delivering real value.

**Current reality:**

* Still have my day job (bills, you know)
* Just launched the site
* Zero users so far
* No idea if this will work
* Honestly, kind of scared

**What I need from you:**

* Brutal feedback - does this sound legit or sketchy?
* If you have an idea collecting dust, let me help you test it
* How would YOU price something like this?
* What would make you actually trust this service?

I'm not trying to get rich. I'm trying to solve a problem that genuinely annoys me while building something people might actually use.

Never experienced traveling outside the province to celebrate my bday kasi nga Holiday: Araw ng patay. Usually close mga establishments at usually punuan ang mga bus/van/ usually wala din samin nagbybyahe.
Nag advance book ako ng flight to Palawan but I just woke up na narefund ng cebpac yung ticket ko so cancelled lol. Parang ayaw ni lord na lumabas ako sa bday ko a.

Any advice po where I can travel this Nov 1? Somewhere I can relax, sip coffee, sketch some sceneries and paint for the whole day, with wifi of course. ",1,1761388352.0,phtravel,6,1.0,False
1ofo9jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiranagar/comments/1ofo9jl/tired_of_these_posts_that_never_turn_into_real/,Tired of these posts that never turn into real plans? I built something for that from right here in Kodihalli.,"I’ve seen so many people try to plan things, game nights, runs, gigs, coffee meetups ,but it always stops at group chats or forms that go nowhere. I felt that too.

That’s why I built **AroundU,** a platform made to turn *intentions* into *actual experiences*.  
You can host or join meetups (its free, literally takes 2 mins to create or 30 mins to join), see who’s attending, and connect safely without dropping your number to randoms. 

Anonymity is great when you’re sharing thoughts online, but not when you’re meeting people in person. AroundU helps you find genuine folks nearby, and actually do things together.

Many of you might’ve already seen AroundU links floating around , please give it a try if you’re looking for real experiences, not just endless chats. You can even drop your AroundU links here on Reddit , it helps you reach genuine people, and helps us grow the community.

I’m **Diwik**, the founder, based in **Kodihalli**, so please support your fellow **Indiranagarian** (if that’s even a word 😅). If yoou want to connect with me on a founder basis, we have a small meetup planned as well on 2nd November.

Founders meetup link -> If you're around, this is where the vibe’s brewing 🌪. Check out this Founders meetup lobby on AroundU [www.aroundu.in/lobby/68f929a8b97ed4117b44d198](http://www.aroundu.in/lobby/68f929a8b97ed4117b44d198)

1ofo7yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ofo7yh/sf_emotional_superposition/,[SF] Emotional Superposition,"John was extra fidgety today. The future of his scientific career depended on what the committee decided. For the past seven years his supervisor - Steven Warner and he have worked only on one project: a superposition generator. 
 
Most projects last a couple of years and even less if they have no tangible results. But Steven and John worked on the project despite there being no solid experimental proof of the generator working. Sure, they had some theoretical success but everyone in the scientific community knew that until they had any experimental result to prove the concept, this would remain another ominous prediction and would be lost in the ever growing ether of “cool-scientific-idea-that will-never-work”. 
 
The only reason the project went for this long was because of how popular Steven was and his achievements in the field. But even that had its limits. With the government cutting funding, every penny needed to be accounted for and that meant shutting down research that made very little promise. John's research was the lowest hanging fruit in the department. 
 
“Steven, the project has to go.” Jeffery Rutheford, the head of school, started the meeting without much of a preamble “ I cannot justify the spending anymore. No results for seven-”
 
“But Jeff, the math is all there. We have worked it out. We just need some more time.” Steven replied cutting off Jeffery
 
“You have had seven years. I have people that need answering to and no I cannot push it any further with the military either” Jeffery said with a voice of finality. 
 
“And it is not fair on all the other grad students, Dr Warner. You have seen the reports, if we don't pour more money into the program we will lose some serious talent.” said Dr Malhotra 
“And that is not something we can afford.” Jeffery added. 
 
The meeting continued with Steven passionately arguing for the project, but John was lost in his thoughts. John knew they were right. It was unfair. The meeting ended with the committee unanimously deciding to gut the research.  
 
“I am sorry John, I know how much this means to you. Do you think we can get this done before the funding is over?” Steven asked him as they settled onto the bench next to the pond. 
This was their go to place for thinking. Steven said that watching the swans helped to clear his brain and sure enough this was where they had their best ideas. 
 
“I will try Steven” John replied with a tired smile 
 
“It won’t be the worst thing in the world if we can’t get the machine to work. Like all good things, this has to end somewhere too” Steven said.
“Yes, but it feels wrong to just leave it this close to completion”
“I know, kid. This is not the ending you want. But often times in science and even in life, you might not get the ending you want but that is not to say it’s a bad ending”
 
John realised that Steven was about to go off in a philosophical rant about life and science and he was in no mood for it.
“I better get back to work then” John said before Steven could add anything and started walking to the lab.
As he walked his thoughts drifted to his first introduction to quantum mechanics. When John first learned that one thing can be at different places at the same time, he was shocked and in a state of almost disbelief. Then they did the double slit experiment. Sure enough the light did work as if it was at two places at the same time. It was magical. They called it superposition. 
 
The more he thought of it, the more it intrigued him. If a photon can be at different places at the same time what else can do it? He soon learned that there is a quantum limit. The bigger the particle, the lower the chance of it to superposition. His then professor, now supervisor lowered his voice as he was teaching and said ""it’s a low chance but at least, in theory, there is an infinitely small possibility that anything can superposition""
 
Wow! A world where anything can superposition. He wondered what it would look like for platypus- his beloved snake plant to superposition? What if he could superposition? A John that could be at a lot of different places at the same time.
That thought brought a wave of sadness to him. It reminded him of the fire and how he wished he could be everywhere at the same time to pull them all to safety. 
 
He pushed the thought aside. There was sufficient funds for another couple of months and if he can get a breakthrough before that, he can keep the project. Time to get to work. 
 
He went through the routine again, turning on the lasers, getting the location ready and running the generator. He changed the temperature and pressure of the field generator. The machine started buzzing. He slumped down on the chair waiting for the magic to happen. Soon the exhaustion took hold of him and he slipped into a fitful sleep. 
 
“Mommy, daddy!” John screamed into his parents bedroom.
He could see smoke coming out of their room.
He continued screaming “mommy, daddy…”
Coughs and gasps were all he could hear and then his dad’s voice came out in a rush
“John, get your sisters out of the house now…. RUN!!” he coughed again “we are stuck here 
 
John stood there dumbfounded; frozen in the moment.
“John! Do it now!” his father coughed
 
He was running now, trying to open his sister’s  bedroom. But he couldn’t. Something was pushing against the door. He could hear them coughing and their shouts
“John… help” more coughs
He ran back and body slammed the door but it did not budge.
 
He was running as fast as he could to Mr. Patrick’s. He will help, John. 
 
“I need to get them out” he shouted to Mr Patrick. 
 
Next thing he knew there were red and blue lights all around him. Mr. Patrick had him on a tight hold. He is frantically trying to get out and run into the burning house. He needs to get them out.
 
“Let go! Let goo… please let goooo” he is screaming now. 
 
He woke with a start and gasped for air. It took a second for him to realise that he was in the lab and it was eerily quiet indicating a complete run of the machine. 
 
Time to analyse what went wrong this time. But coffee, first! 
 
Half awake he reached for the coffee cup but stopped mid way. The cup was not where he left it, it was all around the table and the image of the cup seemed to be buzzing.  He rubbed his eyes and concentrated. Yes, it was not his sleepy eyes playing a trick, the cup was superpositioning!
 
He hesitantly reached for the cup. When he touched it, the cup fell into itself. 
 
“Did that actually happen? Did the cup....superposition?” He wondered out loud. 
 
He ran to the superposition generator. Everything seemed fine at first glance but the software had a non-critical warning about a malfunctioning integrating board. It was just a temperature sensor and was not critical to the machine. 
 
Did the board malfunctioning somehow fix the superposition generator? 
 
He ran back to the control panel and sure enough the quantum field generator was focused at his table.
 
He scrambled through the software interface till he got to question 
“select region of superposition required”
 
He focused the machine’s camera to the cup again and pressed the RUN button. The humming noise filled the room again. His heart was beating a million beats at a time and his mind was filled with random rushed thoughts. 
 
It worked. A working superposition generator. 
Steven and I will be rich. 
 
Will this work on living objects?
 
Will I be able to superposition? Could I have been everywhere? I could have studied multiple different subjects at the same time, like what Dr. Strange did in KamaTaj. 
I could have stopped the fire. 
 
Oh! the strange and random thoughts of a man!
 
The silence drew his attention back to the present and there it was again. The cup is no longer there as a cup but as a buzzing image of itself around a portion of the table. The cup was superpositioning again. 
 
John decided that it was time to do some more testing. This time around, it should be a living thing. He brought over platypus- his beloved snake plant into the machine's quantum field and turned it on. 
 
Sure enough, the plant started to buzz. Soon a small portion of the table was occupied by the buzzing image of the plant just like the cup did. 
 
As he stood there trying to grasp the magnitude of what he just witnessed, the doors to the labs busted open.
 
“John, Steven is in hospital. He fainted!” Raj from the condensed matter group said.
 
“What? What happened?”
 
“The paramedics said he had a heart attack”
 
A heart attack!
 
Steven was the closest thing to a family John has had for a long time. John was smitten with Steven from that lecture on superposition. He pestered him with email to get a chance to work in Steven's lab. 
After a lot of “this work is too advanced for an undergraduate” and “you will never be able to enjoy uni if you start research this early”, Steven understood that John does not plan on backing down. And so, he offered him a position in his lab.
 
John took it, with the eagerness of a kid with a new toy. Afterall, what if he could create superpositioning firefighters? No one will die of a fire, all because of his invention.
 
Having no immediate family or friends, John started spending most of his waking hours in the lab. Soon, it was clear to Steven that if anyone could crack this enigma, it was them. Steven and John started spending more and more time together, working out the equations and the experimental setups. 
The lake became their favourite spot. During one of those deep discussions, John opened up about his past and about the fire. Until that point, John was another student, a good one, but this changed everything for Steven. Being an orphan himself, Steven saw himself in John. 
 
“John, John!” Raj’s desperate voice pulled him back from dream land. 
“He passed away!”
 
John’s mind was racing. Steven passed away?
 
And then he started to run. John was not sure where he was running to, but he needed to get away. A million thoughts rushed into his head. 
 
His first quantum mechanics class- listening to Steven talk of superposition. The meeting where John all but begged for Steven to hire him to work. The endless nights in the lab with takeout food. The first time John cracked a joke and got a laugh out of that placid face. It started as a reluctant smile, but you could see his brain catching up and then came the hearty chuckle that startled the swans. 
Now it was his dad chuckling at his own joke in his memory. He looked at his little sister and mom to see the “you- are-impossible” look on them. He remembered running around with the hose and spraying them, how his mother would get annoyed, but his dad would always jump on the beat to spray everyone else. 
Holding his sister’s arm as they walked to the school bus. The look on his mother’s face as John asked her a million questions about everything and nothing. 
 
And then he thought of his experiment, wishing he could superposition. This time not to save or fix anything but to be everywhere all at once, so he could soak in all their love and warmth. 
 
He found himself standing facing the lake. The setting sun made the bushland look as if it was on fire. The swans were swimming off into their homes. The thought came back in a rush.

1ofo7pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSMarketing/comments/1ofo7pp/tired_of_mailchimp_brevo_hoppy_copy_i_built_an/,"Tired of Mailchimp, Brevo & Hoppy Copy? I built an email platform on a $1 iCloud account. Check it out.","After a frustrating run-in with existing tools, I finally put together a fully functional email marketing platform. And here's the kicker: it runs literally on just a $1 iCloud account.

I've been through the wringer with platforms like Mailchimp, Brevo, Hoppy Copy, and a bunch of other 'enterprise solutions.' Honestly, they all feel the same: incredibly expensive, packed with a gazillion features you never use, and still clunky as hell when it comes to the basics. All I really needed was something that could send a high volume of emails, handle multiple domains seamlessly, and not break the bank.

So, out of principle and a strong desire for a better solution, I decided to build my own. This platform can:

Send a high volume of messages.
Manage multiple domains (tested and working!).
Generate email content on the fly (thanks to a bit of AI wizardry).
Handle contact list uploads smoothly.
And all of this for the cost of a coffee – quite literally, just that $1 iCloud storage plan. I'm genuinely surprised how robust this turned out to be.

I've decided to make it available for anyone who's fed up with bloated SaaS subscriptions and wants a dirt-cheap, functional alternative for their email marketing needs.

Check it out here: https://coresend.xyz/

What do you all think? Is this something you'd actually use? Would love to hear your feedback!
