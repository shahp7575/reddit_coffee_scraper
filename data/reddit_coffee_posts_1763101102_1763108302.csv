So I have been assigned to this audit client which is ""highly critical"" and apparently ongoing for the last 9-10 months. This is my third month on the job. 

This job is draining my energy because apart of not being closed it involves a lot of executive reviewers due to some restatements and other stuff. 

The other day, I was on my way home from the client side, I received a call from the manager on the job, I told him that I will connect with him in a bit. 30 minutes later, I get a call from my partner and officer leader stating that I ""wasn't available the entire week"".

Mind that the only time I have gone unresponsive is over the weekend since my view is if I am not getting overtime or comp off, why should I be working over the weekend? 

This engagement has taken a toll on my mental health and I have slept only 3-4 hours daily and have been surviving on energy drinks and coffee so badly that I have taken ""sick days"" just to get some sleep. 

I tried talking to my office leader but nobody wants to put another senior on the job since it includes auditing 4 years Financials. We are barely at the end of the first year. ",1,1763107985.0,Big4,0,1.0,False

If you've been putting off investing in your mental health, these deals make it actually affordable.

---

Hey everyone! Mental health apps can be genuinely life-changing, but they're also expensive AF. Black Friday is literally the only time of year these apps discount significantly, so I wanted to share what I've found.

I've personally used several of these (Headspace for 2+ years, tried BetterHelp for 6 months), and researched the rest extensively. Here's the breakdown:

## 🌟 Best Deals by Category

### 🏆 MEDITATION APPS

**1. Headspace – Best Overall**
- **Deal:** 50% off annual = $34.99/year (normally $69.99)
- **That's:** $2.92/month
- **Valid through:** December 4th
- **What you get:** 500+ guided meditations, mental health courses, sleep stories, focus music

**Why I love it:** Headspace is what got me into meditation. The instructors are actually good (not annoying), courses are structured, and it works for both beginners and people who've meditated forever. At $3/month, this is stupid cheap for what you get.

**Science:** Studies show users experience 14-28% reduction in stress after 10 days. I can vouch—it genuinely helps with anxiety.

---

**2. Calm – Best for Sleep**
- **Price:** $79.99/year (sometimes up to 60% off during sales)
- **What you get:** 500+ Sleep Stories (Matthew McConaughey, Harry Styles narrating!), calming music, breathing exercises

**When Calm beats Headspace:** If you struggle with sleep specifically. The celebrity Sleep Stories are weirdly effective at putting you to sleep. If your main issue is insomnia or nighttime anxiety, go with Calm.

---

**3. Insight Timer – Best Free Option**
- **Price:** $0 (seriously, completely free)
- **What you get:** 100,000+ free guided meditations, music, timer, community

**The catch:** There's no catch. It's genuinely free forever, not a trial. The library is huge. I started here before upgrading to Headspace because I wasn't sure I'd stick with meditation.

**Who should use this:** Anyone on a tight budget, or anyone unsure about meditation who wants to try before committing money.

---

### 💬 THERAPY APPS (Licensed Therapists)

**4. BetterHelp – Largest Network**
- **Deal:** 20% off first month
- **Price:** $260-320/month (after discount)
- **What's included:** Weekly 45-min video/phone session + unlimited messaging with your therapist
- **Network:** 33,000+ licensed therapists (PhD, PsyD, LCSW, LMFT)

**Who it's for:** Anyone needing professional therapy but don't have insurance or live somewhere without good therapists.

**Important:** BetterHelp does NOT accept insurance. It's cash pay. But they do offer financial aid if you can't afford full price.

**My experience:** I used BetterHelp for 6 months during a rough breakup. Being able to message my therapist between sessions was huge when I was spiraling at 2am. Matched with a good therapist within 48 hours.

---

**5. Talkspace – Best If You Have Insurance**
- **Price:** $69-109/week ($276-436/month)
- **With insurance:** Many people pay $0-30 copay
- **Accepts:** Aetna, Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, TRICARE, Medicare

**When Talkspace beats BetterHelp:** If you have insurance. Period. Talkspace can drop your therapy costs from $300+/month to literally $0-30 depending on your plan.

**Bonus:** Talkspace offers psychiatry (medication management), which BetterHelp doesn't. If you think you might need meds for depression/anxiety/ADHD, this is the platform.

---

**6. Cerebral – Best for Meds + Therapy**
- **Price:** $85-325/month
- **What you get:** Psychiatric evaluation, medication prescriptions + therapy
- **Who needs this:** People who need both therapy and medication in one place

If you suspect you need antidepressants, anxiety meds, or ADHD treatment, Cerebral handles the full spectrum: diagnosis → prescription → therapy.

## 💡 Pro Tips from Experience

### Tip 1: You Can Stack Apps

I use **BetterHelp (therapy) + Insight Timer (free meditation)** = $260/month total, but I get professional therapy PLUS daily meditation tools. My therapist actually recommended I meditate between sessions, so this combo works perfectly.

### Tip 2: Annual = Huge Savings

Headspace monthly = $12.99/month
Headspace annual = $34.99/year (with Black Friday) = $2.92/month

**You save $121/year** by going annual. Even if you only use it 4-5 months, you still come out ahead.

### Tip 3: Start Free, Upgrade If Needed

Don't drop $70 on Headspace if you've never meditated. Download Insight Timer (free), try it for 2 weeks, see if you actually USE it. If you do, upgrade to Headspace during Black Friday for the structure and polish.

### Tip 4: FSA/HSA Eligible

BetterHelp and Talkspace are usually FSA/HSA eligible. If you have a health savings account, you can pay with pre-tax dollars (effectively 20-30% discount). Check with your administrator.

### Tip 5: Therapy Matching Takes Time

Both BetterHelp and Talkspace let you switch therapists for free. If your first match isn't great, SWITCH. Don't settle. Finding the right fit is crucial. Most people find their ideal therapist within 1-2 switches.

## 🔬 Do These Actually Work?

**Real talk:** Yes, but only if you actually use them.

**Meditation apps:**
- 14-28% reduction in stress (studies with Headspace)
- 20-30% decrease in anxiety symptoms
- 15-20% improvement in sleep quality
- **Catch:** You have to do it consistently. 10 min/day for 2-3 weeks = measurable results.

**Online therapy:**
- Research shows online therapy is as effective as in-person for depression, anxiety, PTSD
- 60% of BetterHelp users wouldn't have sought therapy otherwise (accessibility matters)
- **Catch:** Still therapy. Still takes time. Not a magic fix.

**My personal results:**
- Headspace: Definitely notice less anxiety spiraling, better sleep (use it most nights)
- BetterHelp: Helped me work through relationship issues, gave me coping strategies I still use
- Insight Timer: Use it when I don't want structure, just want to relax

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is BetterHelp as good as in-person therapy?**
For most things (depression, anxiety, relationship stuff), yes. Research says online therapy is equally effective. But if you have severe issues (suicidal thoughts, psychosis), you need in-person care.

**Q: Headspace or Calm—which is better?**
- **Headspace:** Better for learning meditation, more structured, better courses
- **Calm:** Better for sleep, more celebrity content, more ""spa-like""
- **Winner at Black Friday pricing:** Headspace ($35 vs Calm's $80)

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
Yes, both meditation and therapy apps let you cancel. Annual subscriptions usually aren't refundable though, so if you go annual, commit to at least trying it.

**Q: What if my therapist sucks?**
Switch. Both BetterHelp and Talkspace let you change therapists for free, unlimited times. Don't stay with someone who doesn't work for you.

**Q: When do these deals expire?**
Most run through Cyber Monday (Dec 1), but Headspace's 50% off specifically ends Dec 4. Don't wait until Black Friday—deals are already live.

## 🎯 My Personal Recommendations

**If I could only choose ONE app:**
**Headspace at $34.99/year** (Black Friday price). It's $2.92/month for 500+ meditations, mental health courses, and sleep support. That's less than a single coffee. If you're even remotely interested in meditation or sleep improvement, this is a no-brainer.

**If I need therapy:**
- **No insurance?** BetterHelp with 20% off first month
- **Have insurance?** Talkspace (check if you qualify for $0 copay)

**If I'm broke:**
Insight Timer. 100% free, 100,000 meditations, zero catch. Start here.

**If sleep is my main problem:**
Calm. The Sleep Stories genuinely work. Matthew McConaughey's voice will put you to sleep whether you want it to or not.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Mental health care used to be $150+/session for in-person therapy, or meditation classes at $20-30/pop. Now you can get professional therapy for $65/week or guided meditation for $3/month.

Black Friday makes it even more accessible. These aren't just shopping deals—they're investments in not feeling like crap all the time.

I've dealt with anxiety for years. Meditation apps (specifically Headspace) taught me to manage it without spiraling. Therapy (BetterHelp) gave me tools to handle life stress. Both were worth way more than what I paid.

If you've been putting off taking care of your mental health because of cost, this is your moment. $35/year or $0 is not the barrier anymore.

**Take care of yourself. You deserve it.**

We were introduced one time to each other by the mgmt, exchanged calling cards, but we don't usually see each other and nakita ko lang sya once sa isang event sa office. But he really caught my eye. Sabi nga sa kanta ""'Di naman sya sobrang gwapo, ngunit sya ang type na type ko"" Muka syang soft, ung mga expat kasi rito samin kala mo laging galit. Haha.

As a straightforward girl, I sent him a message. I told him na naalala ko sa event sabi nya first time nya lang dito sa Pinas, and if he wanted to explore around here or his family, I'd be glad to help. Sabi nya na-appreciate nya raw and my message made his day. 

Since then, everyday na kami magkausap. But only, good morning, updates, kamustahan, etc. We decided to meet one time outside work, and it was great. We really jived. I asked him if he has a family na, and I learned na he's married na to his second wife, no kids. His wife doesn't mind naman daw na magkaroon sya ng friend na girl, since may mga guy na friends din daw ang wife nya. I could feel naman na genuine yung pinapakita nya with me, and like no malice. It's clear to me na rin that I have to draw some boundary. 

Nasundan ng ilang beses ung labas namin for coffee, meals, it's just the two of us lang, but for me walang malice rin talaga. We still message each other everyday, as in everyday. Nasa higher management sya and sobrang busy nyang tao, but nag-uupdate sya, well hindi naman bawat kibot, but I got to know small glimpse of what happened to his everyday life. Like, pauwi na sya, nasa office na sya, etc.

I really like him as a friend, I want to cherish this friendship. I don't want it to be awkward too, so I don't want to look deeply into it. But for guys, do you think we're beyond friends or not? I don't want to be a third-party rin kasi.

Read his incredible story below!

# JOSEF MALISZEWSKI’S INITIAL EXPERIENCE

On June 19, 1951, at about 2AM, Polish-born mechanic Josef Maliszewski heard a mysterious whistling sound from outside his summer residence in Mønsterkolonien 166, Sønderborg. He went outside and saw a strange-looking vehicle landing in a nearby field to the east, in the direction of the village of Sundsmark. The vehicle somewhat resembled an aircraft, but was 100 meters long – longer than the biggest commercial aircraft manufactured even today — and bluish silver in colour. The vehicle had halfmoon-shaped wings that folded out when landing, a rotor in the middle, and stood on landing gear with horseshoe-like feet. The vehicle had round windows on the side, similar to those on a seagoing ship.

Maliszewski ran towards the vehicle, but approximately 50 meters from it a mysterious force stopped him. He could not walk any further, but could still hear and see as well as move his arms and hands. He noticed that not just had the birds stopped singing, the cattle and horses in the field had also stopped moving. Maliszewski assumed for some reason that the occupants of the mysterious vehicle had come to abduct the livestock in the field, but he then suddenly heard a voice saying: ”Do not be afraid, we will not take any of them.”

*Sketch/model made by Maliszewski of the craft he encountered*

Maliszewski then saw eight small flying saucers exiting the vehicle, four from each side. The small saucers ascended into the sky, where they stayed hovering over the bigger vehicle making a slight wobbling sound. A type of escalator descended from the main vehicle and six crewmen walked out the vehicle through the escalator. Two of the crewmen began repairing the right wing of the vehicle, two others inspecting the vehicle’s left wing while the remaining two stood guard at the escalator.

The crew were unusually tall, dark-skinned and extremely graceful in appearance but perfectly similar to Earth humans – Maliszewski would later describe the crew as South East Asian in appearance, reminding him of Indonesians. They wore glittery dark blue one-piece spacesuits with no apparent seams, and transparent bubble-shaped helmets. Their faces were covered by a type of oxygen mask with tubes connecting to 2 oxygen tanks on each of their backs, similar to those worn by navy divers. Maliszewski saw more crew members in the vehicle’s windows, wearing the same uniforms as those outside the craft.

While Maliszewski watched the strange vehicle and the crew, he said to himself ”oh how we people on Earth are stupid” only to immediately receive a telepathic reply from the vehicle, about Earth people not being any less intelligent than the spacefarers, but now that we had entered the atomic age the space people had arrived to warn us about the importance of taking control over our destiny. The telepathic message from the space people mentioned that they had also mastered nuclear energy, but we had not yet learned to use it in a safe, cheap and peaceful manner. After the crew had finished repairing the spaceship’s wings, the wings retracted back into the ship’s hull and folded back out again.

The crew went back into the spaceship and the escalator was retracted. Maliszewski then received a final telepathic message from the crew: ”Farewell, we will meet again.” The spaceship ascended into the sky with a whistling sound. When it reached an altitude of 100 meters, the small unmanned saucers retracted into the spaceship as well, disappearing into doors on the sides of it — four saucers on each side. The spaceship then ascended further into the sky and disappeared in a flash of light that illuminated the entire sky, with sparks of light visible afterwards.

Maliszewski could suddenly move again, and the livestock in the field now began running away. The birds even resumed singing. He also noticed that the spaceship had left landing traces on the field with two clear marks from the supporting landing legs’ horseshoe-like feet. Each landing mark’s surface was 4 x 2 meters, and 35 footsteps were visible between the traces. Maliszewski later asked the neighbours, who told him that a lot of people had walked over to the field afterwards to get a good look at the mysterious traces.

Maliszewski also noted that his pocketwatch had stopped at 2:30. When he arrived back at his summer residence, he saw that the clock in his bedroom had also stopped at 2:30. A few days later, Maliszewski attempted to repair both his pocket watch and the stationary clock in his bedroom. He succeeded in getting the pocket watch to function as before, but not the clock.

In the days following his experience, Maliszewski had a weird acidic taste in his mouth and was constantly thirsty. He also had problems with falling asleep at night as well as diarrhea.

Maliszewski later told co-workers at the gas station where he was employed, about the incident. None of them believed him and replied that he probably had been hallucinating or dreaming, or gotten drunk and seen an aircraft that he mistook for an advanced spaceship. Maliszewski replied that he had never been intoxicated in his life. After work, Maliszewski made a sketch of the spaceship and contacted the local newspaper Sønderjyden (”the South Jutlandian”) about his experience.

# MALISZEWSKI’S SECOND EXPERIENCE

On May 18, 1954, Maliszewski went on a fishing trip at around 2 AM to his favorite spot, halfways between Høruphav and Sønderskov. There, Maliszewski saw a small and elegant-looking saucer-shaped craft flying towards him, over the water at a low altitude. The spaceship made a buzzing sound that Maliszewski later compared to that of a sewing machine. The flying saucer stopped close to him and a hatch popped open, with the pilot disembarking from the ship. He held a silver-coloured pitcher containing a blue liquid and poured it into a glass for Maliszewski, who at first hesitated to drink it. Maliszewski found his anxiety disappearing and drank the glass of blue liquid, which tasted similar to red wine.

The pilot then invited Maliszewski aboard the spaceship. When the spaceship had flown out over the ocean, the pilot played a tape recording of a message spoken in fluent Danish by a feminine voice. The saucer pilot also gave Maliszewski a piece of bread he had. The voice from the tape recorder told Maliszewski to eat the bread aboard the ship.

The saucer’s pilot played more tape recordings that described in fine detail how the spaceship’s engines functioned, and showed Maliszewski the machinery on board: Their nuclear reactors functioned according to different operating principles than the primitive ones on Earth, making them safer and less wasteful as well as cheaper to maintain, with the flying saucer being powered by a nuclear reactor located beneath its floor; their anti-gravity engines that used electromagnetic fields to compress air and create an air cushion, as well as how their spaceships could turn invisible.

Maliszewski asked the pilot where he came from, and the pilot played a new tape recording. This message revealed that the spacefarers came from a planet named Suton or Zutorn, in another solar system. (Different articles about Maliszewski’s UFO encounters use different spellings — Maliszewski never specified which spelling he preferred) Maliszewski would later clarify that Zutorn was not to be confused with Saturn in our own solar system, and had 4 moons and orbited a sun similar to our own.

The pilot also disclosed to Maliszewski that the Zutornians had a mothership in orbit around Earth where it would stay for a 15-year mission, and the saucer could not fly further away from the mothership than 50,000 kilometers. In the upper reaches of our atmosphere, the Zutornian vehicles flew on magnetic waves and not air cushions like they used closer to the surface.

Before the Zutornian pilot dropped Maliszewski off at the fishing spot, he told Maliszewski that they would return to pick him up again exactly 14 days later.

# Maliszewski’s Final Experience

On May 30, 1954 Maliszewski indeed met the same saucer pilot as a couple weeks before, again at his favourite fishing spot. Once more, Maliszewski was invited aboard the small saucer-shaped ship by the pilot, who smiled but did not utter a word, instead communicating by telepathy. The Zutornian pilot offered Maliszewski to show him how beautiful outer space was. This time, the saucer pilot took him up through the atmosphere to the kilometer-long Zutornian mothership in orbit around Earth.

From the saucer, Maliszewski could see the Earth and observe the aurora borealis near the poles, which Maliszewski described as a fire slinging up from the surface and shining as bright as the sun. Maliszewski saw this from a television screen aboard the saucer, not through its windows. He was also shown video recordings that the Zutornians had taken of other planets of our solar system, including Saturn and its moons.

The saucer eventually arrived at the mothership and entered through a circular airlock on its side, where the pilot and Maliszewski waited a minute before they could leave the saucer and take a walk aboard the mothership.

Aboard the mothership, Maliszewski met an extremely beautiful and extremely tall (approximately 2 meters) slender woman who wore a glittering suit, a miniskirt and a cloak. She was accompanied by similar-looking individuals who said nothing. The woman spoke fluent Danish and gave him three kisses – one on each cheek and one on the forehead. She then told him: ”You are my brother, and I am your sister. You should not believe that you are alone in this mighty universe”.

Maliszewski then asked her about how the society of the Zutornians was organised, as well as whether they had any type of religion and believed in a God or Devil like those of Christianity. The Zutornian woman told Maliszewski that they knew of an entity they called the Supreme Being, and that the only thing the Supreme Being requested was that you love your neighbor. The Earth was the Supreme Being’s colony, which he had used similar races to colonize who might have had different skin colors, but were the same underneath. She then said that the Supreme Being wished no evil upon his creations, but there existed also a being of envy who wanted to destroy everything, and who might be the same entity that humans called The Devil.

Maliszewski had a lengthy discussion with the Zutornian woman about the state of affairs on Planet Earth. She told him that the people of Earth ought to abolish militaries and the money-based economy, work less, as well as give independence to all our colonies, to bring our society closer in line to that of the Zutornians. The Zutornians had no use for passports, wandering freely between planets, and viewed life on Earth as similar to a prison since we kept restricting our lives for no reason.

Maliszewski was also told that space people similar to those on Zutorn and on Earth lived on many planets throughout the cosmos, all of which were ruled by the Supreme Being mentioned earlier, and that these space people did not age like we Earth humans did. Their planet also had plant and animal life similar to that on Earth. The reason that these space people had not yet officially contacted us on Earth, was that we were still not intelligent enough to avoid using nuclear power for

war, and if a third world war was to happen, then human life on Earth would not survive. The Zutornians had come to Earth to warn us against exactly that scenario. The Zutornian woman told Maliszewski, that on her planet “the small was as the great and the great as the small”, meaning that nobody had a position above anyone else. He was also told that Venus was inhabited by space humans.

The woman took Maliszewski on a tour around the mothership, which was 1 kilometer long and had a crew of 300 men and women, as well as 100 dwarves (!). Maliszewski saw gardens with flowers around the mothership, and was told that the inner machinery of the ship was made from steel and silver, whereas its exterior hull was made from a plastic-like material derived from the coffee plant. Maliszewski had no problems communicating with the crew, as the Zutornians had followed radio transmissions from Earth for long enough to perfectly understand every Earth language. In particular, they took great interest in listening to our church services.

When Maliszewski had been given a guided tour of the mothership, they took him back to the fishing spot where they dropped him off at half an hour past 5 AM. The trip aboard the Zutornian mothership, Maliszewski calculated, had lasted 3 and a half hours.

# FURTHER EVENTS

**1958, December**: The Danish magazine UFO-Nyt printed an article about Maliszewski’s sighting, containing an illustration he made of the spaceship he saw near Sønderborg, complete with details of its construction and equipment. The article reported that Maliszewski’s clock, which stopped working after the encounter and he could not get repaired himself, was later sent to a laboratory for analysis.

**1959**: Maliszewski became one of the main speakers at SUFOI’s annual conference.

**1963, March**: Maliszewski revealed in an interview with a local newspaper that he was working on a spaceship model and on his 80th birthday would gather the Danish press to invite them on a space trip to the Moon.

**1963, October 26**: Maliszewski died. His son, who lived in the town of Varde at the time, inherited the spaceship model.

# Commentary

The name Josef Maliszewski is virtually unknown today, and very little has been written about his experiences outside of Denmark. Even the many older Danish articles about Maliszewski only mention his first encounter in 1951 and not the following two encounters in May 1954 – perhaps

because of all the elements of ”high strangeness” such as the aliens gifting Maliszewski with bread and wine on the second encounter, or the third encounter revealing that the aliens believe in a Supreme Being and a Being of Envy similar to God and Satan in Christianity. That was probably a bit too much for largely non-religious danes to swallow. Today, his story will seem even more absurd and naive, but it has some interesting details that should make us hesitate rejecting it outright. That does not not mean, however, that we should just accept it at face value.

The Maliszewski case is the first in Denmark, where the witness actually identified the vehicle they saw as an extra-terrestrial spaceship and its crew as extraterrestrials: The Aarslev Enge case of the year 1600 happened before air travel was on the mind of most people — let alone space travel — hence the witnesses talking about ”a wagon with no horses” and ”strangely dressed people”; even the witness to the Kgs. Thisted case of 1944 interpreted what he saw as an experimental German military aircraft and its human pilots.

Maliszewski’s 1951 encounter was also one of the first classic contactee cases anywhere on the planet and, as far as we know, the first in Denmark. Maliszewski’s encounters with graceful, human-looking aliens in glittery jumpsuits who had come to our planet to warn us Earth people about our warlike ways, even predate his countryman George Adamski’s similar encounter with Orthon from Venus, which did not happen until November 20 of 1952. It should be mentioned that this scenario of human aliens travelling to Earth to warn us humans to get our own civilization in order, is the exact plot premise of the 1951 Hollywood science-fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still… yet this film did not premiere in Denmark until November 6 of 1952, more than a year after Maliszewski’s first encounter.

Some of Maliszewski’s later encounters follow the lead of other contactees, however – the encounter with the beautiful woman astronaut on May 30 of 1954 happened a year after the American contactee Truman Bethurum in 1953 wrote about his encounter with the female space captain Aura Rhanes from the planet Clarion.

Like many other UFO sightings, Maliszewski’s first encounter contains a perfect example of the “Oz Factor”, where time seems to stand still as the encounter happens as well as the witness feeling like in a bubble, with all sounds disappearing. Maliszewski getting physically ill after the encounter is also a common feature of close encounter cases and suggests that something tangible and physical happened to him. The same is the case for his pocket watch and the stationary clock that stopped working, something we have heard time again, yet at the time was not an established effect of UFO encounters. On a side note, it is curious that he had success repairing the pocket watch but not the clock inside his house. Also, the encounter did not just impact him but also the cattle and horses outside, as the neighbors even visited afterwards to investigate the mysterious markings in the field.

To 21st century readers, the small saucers discharged by the spaceship in the 1951 sighting sound very similar to drones. As far as the appearance of the spaceship itself goes, it is interesting that it looked very little like either the flying saucers or the cigar-shaped motherships that, according to George Adamski, functioned as flying aircraft carriers for the saucers. What the spaceship that Maliszewski encountered in 1951 instead resembled, more than anything else, was the Sänger Silbervogel (”Silver bird”) — a concept for a rocket-powered bomber aircraft that engineer Eugen Sänger drew during World War 2 for the German air force.

*The Silbervogel bomber. Compare to the illustration in the beginning of this article and you will notice the similarities.*

Later on, however, Maliszewski would encounter manned small saucer-shaped scout ships and long thin motherships orbiting the planet, similar to those described by Adamski. The small surveillance drone saucers being operated from a larger spaceship also sound similar to Adamski’s Telemeter Discs.

It is notable that Maliszewski described the Zutornians as looking perfectly human with their physical appearance being similar to that of people from Java in Indonesia. This was a pretty common description in early CE3 cases, but not something that came into focus until years later.

Another strange aspect of the Maliszewski case that is surprisingly common to UFO encounters across the planet, is part of the second encounter, where the flying saucer pilot gave Maliszewski a glass of wine and a piece of bread. A well known similar case is that of Joe Simonton, who in Northwoods, Wisconsin back in 1961 encountered aliens that gifted him with three small pancakes. It also has clear parallels to the fairy tale tradition of Europe (themselves built on a broader folk tradition stretching far back in time), but it was not until years after Maliszewski’s death that ufologists would start to explore these similar traits.

Ultimately, we do not know whether Josef Maliszewski was a complete fraud, a person with a very vivid imagination, or actually experienced what he said he did. Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between those three options. What we can say for sure, however, is that his story plays an important role in a ufological-historical context, and therefore deserves to be shared with a wider audience than it has so far.

We were sad for a while for losing the view.

so ,this new building construction is resulting in lots of noise pollution and dust but its not like we can do anything. There are other buildings in process of construction  too,but they dont cause as much commotion as this one. Others have construction noises too but never bothered anyone. This building is whole another level ,Its a noise that makes you have a headache at the end of the day,even closed doors and windows doesnt matter. I cant even sit outside with a cup of coffee and a book coz of the loud  hellish sounds. I spoke to one of our neighbours ,they had the same complaints.

Today while cooking for lunch , the deafening sound stopped suddenly. It felt so surreal,the peace and quiet. I went outside to see the building sealed by GHMC(I love you guys) coz apparently the construction is illegal according to the board they placed.Did someone in our street got genuinely irritated by the noise  that they complained to authorities?? or its a normal cease order for illegal activity?? 

Whatever ,I am happy for my ears and happy that i can sit out with my book after weeks of pollution. I know its not dignity to be happy for others sadness but its been too irritating. I know they might resume the construction after the issue is resolved but I'll get atleast some days of tranquility.",1,1763107244.0,hyderabad,0,1.0,False

I’m far from being an art expert, and professionally I deal with strings of 1s and 0s, but I really enjoy hearing how others interpret things. Impressionism has my heart, Monet and Van Gogh especially, though I also admire many other painters of the same era.

If you like slow museum walks, noticing small details in paintings, or just having someone to talk to while wandering around, feel free to reach out. I’d love to meet a few people who enjoy the same calm, thoughtful vibe.

**My Questions for the Community:**

1. **Realistic Timeline:** How long do you think it will take me to reach my goal of 80 kg at 12-15% body fat? I know it's a marathon, but I need a realistic timeframe.
2. **Diet Plan:** **This is my biggest struggle.** Given my staples (chicken, eggs, milk, 1 scoop whey), what should my daily diet look like? How many calories should I aim for? I feel extremely tired since I started, which makes me think my diet is not supporting my activity level.
3. **Routine Feedback:** Is my routine sustainable or is it overtraining? The two-a-days and 6-day split are intense, and the fatigue is real. Should I scale back?
4. **Loose Skin:** With this much weight to lose, what can I do in my diet and training to help minimize loose skin?

💬 “She’s not building a business. She’s building belief — one carousel at a time.”

Words: Martin T. 


✦ PART I — THE BIRTH OF THE BRAND

How to Monetize Your Personality Before It Fully Forms

She didn’t choose content creation — content creation chose her.
(Or maybe the algorithm did. Let’s not get theological about it.)

Once upon a Wi-Fi connection, she realized she could turn her chronic need for validation into a scalable business model.
She called it “building a personal brand.”

Her early feed was an awkward baptism: inconsistent filters, captions in lowercase, too much self-doubt per square pixel. But with time — and several YouTube tutorials — she became fluent in the language of digital divinity.

> “Learning to rest, not to quit.”
– Slide one of her first viral carousel, 2021



She found her niche: vulnerability, but with good lighting.
Her brand became her body, her body her portfolio.

The sacred trinity of modern relevance:
☕ Coffee. 💻 Content. 💫 Control.

Pull quote:

> “If it’s not content, did it even happen?”



(Editor’s note: theology professors still debating this one.)

✦ PART II — THE CHEF OF VIBES

Cooking With Self-Awareness and Too Much Branding

Now she’s not just a creator.
She’s an Executive Chef of Aesthetics.

Every post is a recipe:

1 tbsp curated vulnerability

2 tsp minimalist angst

A generous drizzle of “authenticity”

Garnish with emotional labor and a subtle affiliate link


> “I don’t chase trends — I set the tone,” she says,
while downloading her seventh Pinterest moodboard titled ‘Trends 2026 (Soft Grunge But Clean)’.



Her brunch table is a battlefield of ring lights, micro brands, and unpaid invoices.
No one eats — but everyone posts.

Pull quote:

> “I’m not selling products. I’m selling perspective.”
(Mostly to brands who pay in exposure.)



Every breakdown becomes content.
Every boundary becomes an opportunity.
Every collaboration — a spiritual awakening with a discount code.

(Editor’s note: she’s not toxic; she’s just rebranding her burnout.)

✦ PART III — THE ALGORITHM OF ENLIGHTENMENT

When Self-Optimization Starts to Look Like Self-Destruction

At some point, she begins to glitch.
The brand doesn’t fit anymore — or maybe she doesn’t fit the brand.

She posts:

> “I’m not creating right now, I’m just existing.”



And then boosts it for reach.

The followers flood in:
“This energy. So real. So needed.”
Her engagement rises. Her soul sinks.

> “I feel like I’m performing my own breakdown.”
– StarWannabe, unpublished Notes app draft



Her reflection in the café window looks more like a logo than a woman.
The hustle has become holy; her fatigue, aspirational.

Pull quote:

> “She built a temple to herself and accidentally became its priest.”



But even priests need followers — and she has 48K of them.
So she keeps posting.
Because the algorithm doesn’t believe in sabbaticals.

(Editor’s note: if she logs off, does she still exist? The data’s inconclusive.)


---

 EPILOGUE — THE CONTENT ALWAYS CREATES BACK

Somewhere in her curated exhaustion, there’s a spark of real emotion —
small, unsellable, unfiltered.

But before it reaches the surface, a notification pings.
A brand collaboration. A new aesthetic. A chance to stay visible.

She smiles. Adjusts her filter. Types:

> “Grateful. Grounded. Growing.”



And just like that — the gospel continues.

1owqguk,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1owqguk/called_center/,Called Center,"The elevator jolted to a halt on the fourth floor, the doors shuddering open with a metallic groan that sounded suspiciously like resignation. Elias stepped out onto the thin, industrial-grey carpet, immediately hit by the stale cocktail of recirculated air, cheap instant coffee, and the low-level hum of a hundred conversations happening at once.

This was ""Zenith Customer Solutions"", a name that promised a peak but delivered a basement, regardless of the floor number. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed with a headache-inducing flicker, casting a sickly pallor over the rows of fabric-walled dividers that stretched out like a maze designed to trap hope.

Elias adjusted his collar, which already felt too tight, and scanned the room. He was here for the ""Vital-Link Wellness Band"" account. The irony wasn't lost on him: he was about to spend eight hours a day explaining to angry strangers why their wristbands weren't effectively tracking their inner peace, all while standing in a room that actively depleted it.

He navigated the narrow aisles, dodging a supervisor with a clipboard who was walking too fast and a trash can overflowing with energy drink cans. The noise was a wash of white sound: ""Have you tried resetting it?"", ""I understand your frustration,"" ""Please hold.""

He found his assigned row, G, and counted down the numbers. G-14.

It was a corner cubicle, though that was a generous term for the three-foot expanse of particle board. The walls were pinned with the curled edges of old memos and a single, faded motivational poster of a cat hanging from a branch that someone had defaced with a mustache.

Sitting in the center of the desk was a computer monitor so old it had yellowed to the color of nicotine,stained teeth. Beside it lay a headset, its foam ear, pads flaking away to reveal the black plastic beneath, the cord tangled in a knot that looked impossible to undo. Elias dropped his bag, stared at the blinking cursor on the screen, and sat down.

It took him five minutes to untangle the cord and another five to guess the generic password written on a sticky note under the keyboard (Zenith1). The screen flickered to life, displaying a DOS-like interface with green text: VITAL-LINK SUPPORT v4.2.

He clicked 'READY'. Immediately, a shrill beep pierced his ear.

""Vital-Link, Elias speaking.""

""It’s red!"" A woman’s voice, high,pitched, bordering on hysteria. ""It’s just a solid red line. It’s hot. Is it supposed to be hot?""

Elias referenced the laminated sheet taped to the desk. *Status Light: Red. Protocol: Immediate Redirection.* He hadn't covered this in the twenty minutes orientation video, but the prompt on the screen was blinking urgently.

""Ma'am, I need you to take a deep breath,"" Elias said, his voice falling into a practiced calm he didn't feel. ""I can help you with that. Can you read me the serial number on the inner band?""

""It's... 44902.""

He keyed it in the numbers. The screen flashed. INPUT CODE.

""Thank you. Now, there are two small letters after the number. What are they?""

""Uh... 'RF'.""

He typed it. A block of text appeared on his screen, stark and specific. It wasn't a troubleshooting step.

""Okay... okay. North. Second right. I'm going."" Click.

He stared at the screen as it reset. What kind of tech support was this?

*Beep*

""Hello?"" A child's voice. Maybe seven years old. Sniffling.

""Hi there,"" Elias said, shifting in his creaky chair, ignoring the sweat pricking at his hairline. ""Is everything okay?""

""My bracelet. It's looking at me. It's all red.""

""It's okay, buddy. Don't be scared. Is your mom or dad there? No? Okay, I need you to be brave for a second. Can you read numbers?""

The kid read the serial through sniffles. Then Elias asked for the code.

""NK.""

The screen populated new text.

""Good job. Now, listen. Go out the front door. Turn left. Walk until the sidewalk ends. Turn right. Walk twenty steps. Stop. Close your eyes. Count to one hundred.""

""Okay."" The line went dead.

Elias rubbed his temples. This felt wrong. He looked over the divider; his neighbor was calmly explaining how to sync steps to an iPhone.

*Beep.*

The third call was a man, breathless, aggressive. ""I'm stuck in traffic on the bridge and this damn thing is blinding me! It's solid red! I can't turn it off!""

Elias didn't even blink this time. He felt like an automaton. ""Sir, pull over. Give me the serial.""

""88215. Fix it!""

""Code?""

""QX. Hurry up!""

""Leave your car. Walk forward in the direction of traffic. Count four pillars. Stop. Face the water. Wait.""

""What? I'm not gonna…""

""Those are the instructions, sir. Walk forward. Count four pillars. Face the water.""

The man hung up without a thank you, just the sound of a car door slamming.

Elias sat back, the headset heavy on his ears. The screen blinked back to READY, but he didn't click it again immediately. He looked at his hands; they were shaking slightly. He took a few more calls that afternoon, a teenager in a mall, an elderly woman in a library, all with the red light, all ending with him giving precise, nonsensical coordinates. Walk South. Turn East. Third bench.

At 5:00 PM, the system locked him out automatically.

He pulled the headset off, rubbing the black flakes from his ear. The office hummed on, oblivious. He grabbed his bag and walked back to the elevator, the mysterious instructions swirling in his head as the doors slid shut on his first day.

That night, Elias sat on the edge of his sagging mattress, bathed in the blue light of the evening news. He was nursing a lukewarm beer, trying to wash the sound of the beeps out of his head.

""Breaking news from the East River Bridge,"" the anchor announced, her face composed in practiced gravity. ""A multi,car pileup has resulted in one fatality. Police are investigating.Maybe DUI or malfunction.""

The screen cut to shaky helicopter footage. Ambulances, flares, twisted metal. Then, a brief, blurry zoom,in on a gurney being wheeled away. A limp hand hung off the side. On the wrist, unmistakable in the strobe of emergency lights, was a Vital-Link band. It was pulsing a rhythmic, angry red.

Elias froze. The beer bottle slipped from his hand, thumping onto the carpet and foaming over. He didn't clean it up.

The next day at work, during his fifteen minutes break, Elias huddled in the fire escape stairwell, the only place in the building where the WiFi reached but the supervisors didn't. His hands trembled as he opened the map app on his phone.

He typed in the coordinates for the East River Bridge. He zoomed into the northbound lane, right where the traffic would have stalled. He replayed the instructions in his head. *Walk forward. Count four pillars. Face the water.*

He traced the path on the screen with his thumb. One pillar. Two. Three. Four. He dragged the view to see what lay directly opposite that specific spot, facing the water.

His breath hitched. The phone nearly slipped from his clammy fingers. It made no sense, and yet, looking at the satellite imagery, it made terrifying, absolute sense. He shoved the phone into his pocket, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs.

He went back to his cubicle, but he didn't log in immediately. Instead, he opened a browser window and minimized it to a sliver. He searched.

*Woman heart attack apartment 6th Elm.*

A small local news item popped up. *Found deceased in a vacant building. Authorities are puzzled as she lived two blocks away. Wearing a 'health' bracelet that failed to alert paramedics.*

*Child death tire swing.*

Another article. *Tragedy in the suburbs. Seven years old boy was found beneath a neighbor's tree. Natural causes suspected, sudden cardiac arrest. Parents say he wandered off confused.*

He found another one, a case he hadn't taken but one that fit the timeline. *Child found dead in subway stairway.* The article mentioned the bracelet.

One oped piece caught his eye: *""Vital-Link or Vital-Sink? The wearable tech that watches you die.""* The journalist made a crude, scathing joke about how the only thing the bracelet accurately tracked was the time of death, calling it a ""countdown timer for the gullible.""

Elias sat there, the pieces clicking together with the cold precision of a locking mechanism. The red light wasn't a malfunction. It was a notification.

Over the next few days, he listened harder. He noted the serial numbers. He noted the two letters codes.

44902-DL. The support software, VITAL-LINK SUPPORT v4.2, used the numbers to locate the user, and his place of death.

And the letters.

No idea yet.

It hit him on a Tuesday, midway through a call with an old man gasping for air in a park. This time he asked him for his precise location, and tracked the instructions on his phone to the final location. A synagogue. And the others: a church, a mosque and a cemetery.

The realization washed over him, cold and absolute. The two letters weren't a model number. They were the religion. The belief system. The code determined the ritual, the position, the final comfort needed for the departure.

Elias looked at the old monitor, at the blinking green cursor waiting for his input. He wasn't tech support. He wasn't fixing glitches. He wasn't saving anyone.

1owqg2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1owqg2d/i_met_someone_amazing_but_im_not_feeling_the/,"I met someone amazing, but I’m not feeling the butterflies anymore","TL;DR: I (29M) lost the butterfly feeling about I girl (27F) I’m seeing in within a couple days, and I’m getting bad intrusive thoughts. This has happened in the past and ended potential good relationships for me. I’m afraid I follow an unhealthy pattern for relationships.

I (29M) met a girl (27F) from a dating app. I instantly fell for her when I saw her profile, and in the weeks that lead up to the date, I felt extreme joy every time she would reply to my messages. It took a few weeks to plan a date because she has recently gone through surgery and was not much on the phone, so she did not reply often (sometimes I was waiting 4-5 days for her texts). We went on our date last weekend and it was amazing. It felt like we knew each other for a few months already. We talked for hours, went for a coffee, then a beer, and we kissed at the bar where we had the beer. She eventually invited me over to her place and I spent the night. At the beginning I felt like the luckiest man in the world, she is gorgeous, smart, funny… everything I could look for. However, we have met a couple of times since then, and now it has become clear we are both very much into each other. For some reason, since I got the feeling she was into me and the uncertainty of being liked back was gone, so were the butterflies. Now I have these intrusive thoughts in my head saying that if I’m not feeling those butterflies she’s not the one and this shouldn’t be worth pursuing. This is a problem I have had in the past, and I have left very good relationships and potential relationships in which I felt comfortable because I was convinced I needed to feel those butterflies or that thrill every time I saw my partner, for that to be real love. 
I have now been single for over 7 years, and even though I have had a few situationships over the years, nothing seems to have stuck. The only two times I have felt those butterflies and I’ve been certain I was “in love” was when the girl I was dating was always somehow distant, or hesitant, or would not make it clear to me that things were stable.

I do not like being single, I do not enjoy being on the dating apps and I do not enjoy one night stands anymore as they make me feel empty. I have been wanting to get into a serious relationship for a while now, but I always seem to sabotage myself when I find someone that genuinely likes me, or fall for women that would not reciprocate. I’m really wondering if I’m confusing anxiety or uncertainty for love, and therefore security and stability for lack of love.

I know this is a long text for a girl I just met a week ago, but I am not only concerned about this specific person, but also for the bad pattern I seem to be following when dealing with love and affection, as I believe it could affect my love life forever.

I would really like to know if anyone else has gone through a similar situation or has had the same thoughts, and would also appreciate any advice. Should I keep going with this girl and ignore the intrusive thoughts? Or is the lack of butterflies and thrill a sign that this potential relationship won’t go anywhere?

1owqfst,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1owqfst/called_center/,Called Center,"The elevator jolted to a halt on the fourth floor, the doors shuddering open with a metallic groan that sounded suspiciously like resignation. Elias stepped out onto the thin, industrial-grey carpet, immediately hit by the stale cocktail of recirculated air, cheap instant coffee, and the low-level hum of a hundred conversations happening at once.

This was ""Zenith Customer Solutions"", a name that promised a peak but delivered a basement, regardless of the floor number. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed with a headache-inducing flicker, casting a sickly pallor over the rows of fabric-walled dividers that stretched out like a maze designed to trap hope.

Elias adjusted his collar, which already felt too tight, and scanned the room. He was here for the ""Vital-Link Wellness Band"" account. The irony wasn't lost on him: he was about to spend eight hours a day explaining to angry strangers why their wristbands weren't effectively tracking their inner peace, all while standing in a room that actively depleted it.

He navigated the narrow aisles, dodging a supervisor with a clipboard who was walking too fast and a trash can overflowing with energy drink cans. The noise was a wash of white sound: ""Have you tried resetting it?"", ""I understand your frustration,"" ""Please hold.""

He found his assigned row, G, and counted down the numbers. G-14.

It was a corner cubicle, though that was a generous term for the three-foot expanse of particle board. The walls were pinned with the curled edges of old memos and a single, faded motivational poster of a cat hanging from a branch that someone had defaced with a mustache.

Sitting in the center of the desk was a computer monitor so old it had yellowed to the color of nicotine,stained teeth. Beside it lay a headset, its foam ear, pads flaking away to reveal the black plastic beneath, the cord tangled in a knot that looked impossible to undo. Elias dropped his bag, stared at the blinking cursor on the screen, and sat down.

It took him five minutes to untangle the cord and another five to guess the generic password written on a sticky note under the keyboard (Zenith1). The screen flickered to life, displaying a DOS-like interface with green text: VITAL-LINK SUPPORT v4.2.

He clicked 'READY'. Immediately, a shrill beep pierced his ear.

""Vital-Link, Elias speaking.""

""It’s red!"" A woman’s voice, high,pitched, bordering on hysteria. ""It’s just a solid red line. It’s hot. Is it supposed to be hot?""

Elias referenced the laminated sheet taped to the desk. *Status Light: Red. Protocol: Immediate Redirection.* He hadn't covered this in the twenty minutes orientation video, but the prompt on the screen was blinking urgently.

""Ma'am, I need you to take a deep breath,"" Elias said, his voice falling into a practiced calm he didn't feel. ""I can help you with that. Can you read me the serial number on the inner band?""

""It's... 44902.""

He keyed it in the numbers. The screen flashed. INPUT CODE.

""Thank you. Now, there are two small letters after the number. What are they?""

""Uh... 'RF'.""

He typed it. A block of text appeared on his screen, stark and specific. It wasn't a troubleshooting step.

""Okay, ma'am. I need you to listen closely. Leave your location immediately. Walk North. Take the second turn to your right. Walk fifty paces. Enter the third door on your left. Do not move until you are approached.""

""Okay... okay. North. Second right. I'm going."" Click.

Brought to you by a tradie held together with cable ties, coffee, and pure despair.

7-step guide to making sure your job NEVER gets done before Christmas:



1. Call us last minute.

Ring up on Dec 20th and say:  
“I was gonna call you months ago, but I got busy.”  
Yeah mate, so did we — that’s how calendars work.

2. Book a time… then don’t be home.

We LOVE standing outside your house like we're casing the joint.  
Real professional vibes.

3. Drop a ‘quick little job’ on us.

“While you’re here, can you just do this one tiny thing?”  
If it starts with “just”, it’s NOT tiny.  
If it ends with “should only take five minutes,” you’re lying.

4. Offer your driveway… then treat us like valet parking.

Move forward. Move back. Move to the left.  
Mate, I came to fix your pipes, not audition for Fast & Furious: Suburban Drift.

5. No bathroom, no water.

But sure — let me crawl under your house dehydrated, busting for a piss, like a sewer goblin who doesn’t deserve basic human rights.  
Cheers for that.

6. Argue the bill.

Say things like:  
“Mate, I didn’t think it would cost that much.”  
Neither did I — until I met you.

And then the classic:  
“I’ll pay you when my bonus comes in.”  
Sweet as, I’ll just tell my power company the same thing.

# 7. OR — wild idea — DON’T do any of this.

Here’s the real talk:

Tradies aren’t robots.  
We’re flat out. We’ve got families, deadlines, and a to-do list long enough to wrap around your house twice.  
We’re trying to help — even if we look like zombies with tool belts.

So be decent. Book early. Be patient. Be human.  
We’d like to get your job done AND make it home before Santa does.",131,1763106202.0,newzealand,36,0.92,False

This project sits at the intersection of world-class design and unmatched accessibility. Elie Saab’s signature style powers every inch of these 3, 4, and 5 BHK residences, while Smart World’s urban planning expertise shapes a community built for high-performance living.

https://preview.redd.it/076uu9pef61g1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a2d722d8bc04372e8bbf65c403307b5686dd73f

Let’s start with mobility, because that’s where Sector 98 takes the crown. Sitting directly on the Noida–Greater Noida Expressway, the commute math becomes ridiculously simple. South Delhi? About 15–20 minutes through the DND Flyway. Corporate parks like Infosys, HCL, and Advant Navis? Practically around the corner. The Jewar Airport corridor opens global access, and the upcoming metro extension strengthens public transit. In a city where daily travel often leads to frustration, this neighborhood gives you an edge.

Then there’s the 75-acre Phil Ryan golf course—one of the project’s biggest assets. Most luxury towers talk about lifestyle; [**Smart World Noida**](https://www.smartworldproperty.com/residential/noida/) delivers it through its surroundings. You don’t just get greenery—you get a massive, open landscape that resets your senses. It’s rare to find a view that stays unobstructed and meaningful as the city keeps expanding, but Sector 98 offers exactly that. Living next to a course of this scale elevates your mental space, your health, and the overall look and feel of your home.

Inside the residences, the design influence of Elie Saab is unmistakable. Think clean layouts, premium materials, curated textures, and an elegance crafted for people who appreciate detail. You also get Noida’s first Elie Saab-branded commercial space within the development—perfect for professionals who want their morning coffee, meetings, and essentials handled without battling traffic.

Sector 98 is surrounded by top schools, high-end retail, major offices, and entertainment hubs like DLF Mall of India. Families benefit from quick school runs, professionals benefit from short commutes, and investors benefit from the location’s rising demand and low inventory of comparable luxury offerings.

If you want a home that mixes style, accessibility, and branded luxury without compromise, this project nails the formula.

30s. About 9 months on hrt. I'll admit I was starting from a very traditionally masculine build. Broad shoulders, deep voice, heavy brow, square jaw. The whole thing. 

But even after 9 months I still read very masculine to people. I'm sure it doesn't help that the kind of girl I am, or aim to be, is a relatively masc lesbian. I wear cargo pants and metal band shirts. I have tattoos, and chipped black nail polish. I don't get dolled up with makeup and nice clothes unless its for special occasions. 

A few months ago I started a new coffee job. I know how I present. I know how I'm received by people. I know how I look and sound. I compromised on my own identity for the sake of reducing friction. Told my coworkers they/them instead of she/her. Within a day everyone gave up or didn't bother trying. I don't wear any kind of pronoun pins on my work apron. I am sir'd and mr'd all day at work by my coworkers and customers. I smile and laugh and make the coffee.

It has infected my brain. I have dreams where people refer to me by my dead name. When I push back they get mad at me. I am haunted by the ghost of my former life. Even strangers who've only ever known the new me seem to see through what I'm trying to achieve. ",4,1763105816.0,MtF,1,0.75,False

We didn't chat much but there was some mutual curiosity towards each other. A couple of weeks later, I got her contact from a mutual friend. I texted her and she immediately responded. After a couple of texts, I asked her out for a cup of coffee and she accepted my invite. We were supposed to meet on Saturday. On Friday, I texted her to confirm and suggested a place. She replied at the end of the day confirming but she suggested another place at another time. I don't know why but I somehow misread the text. I thought she wanted to meet at another place at another time on another day i.e Su day(!!!)

So, on Saturday, while I was chilling at home, she texted me and asked where I was. I didn't mean what she meant so as a joke I replied: I am exactly where I was supposed to be. She replied: I don't see you. And I said: well, I don't see you either.
She asked: are you kidding? And that's when I realised that she was actually serious! I was like, I thought we were meeting tomorrow. She said, oh.... I immediately scrolled up the previous chat and realised my mistake. I texted her apologising and asked her to wait 10 minutes as I lived nearby. But she said she was going home and said, it's okay it happens.
I called her, left her a voice message and even the next day I texted her apologising and asking for another chance.

She read my message two days later but never responded. It's been a month now since this happened and I don't know what should I do.

I know I should leave her alone but my friends keep insisting that I shouldn't give up and try to ask her again.

Back in March/April I was going through the interview process for a Packaging Designer role at a dream company of mine. I made it to the very last round of interviews, which took 3 months total, and didn’t end up getting the job. Heartbreaking. But we move on and learn. One of the people who interviewed me was the Senior Packaging Designer who was incredibly lovely and very cool. I ended up sending her a request to connect on LinkedIn after the fact and she accepted immediately. Fast forward to today. I received an email this morning from a Senior Talent Manager at this company saying she’s seen my previous application and was wondering if I’m interested in speaking with her about a current role they just posted, a Senior Packaging Product Designer. When I tell you, my heart skipped a beat. This is dream job territory. I immediately set up a call with her and it’s coming up in a few days. 

I really would love a chance at this role. I had a thought to reach out to the Senior Packaging Designer and ask her if she has time for a 20 minute chat via video call or even an in person coffee to ask her for any advice she may have for me as she saw me through the interview process for the previous role. This current role isn’t directly related to her team so there wouldn’t be an immediate conflict of interest, but I’m still worried about if this is the correct thing to do professionally. I want to intentionally approach this and was wondering if this was a good or bad idea to reach out to her?

The Lycoris are all orphaned teenage girls who are trained to be cold hearted assassins, basically child soldiers, the plot centres on one Lycoris named Takina who is demoted from HQ due to disobeying orders and sent to work with another Lycoris named Chisato, they team up with the rest of her squad inside a coffee shop and they go around fighting criminals.

Nothing unique as a concept, there were plenty of anime of ""Little girls with guns"" in the early 2000s like gunslinger girl or Kanan, Takina is the pure Lycoris who is all serious on her job while Chisato is the more cheerful one, and unlike the other Lycoris she has this ""all life is precious"" ideology and as such use ""non lethal red paint bullets"" to take down bad guys instead of killing them, she is also OP and can dodge bullets at point blank range.

The rest of the cast are all just boring one dimonsional characters, glasses girl dose nothing, loli hacker is just an exposition dump and can use her bullshit hacking power when the plot feels like it, Mika is probably the only guy who isn't one dimonsional, the rest of the Lycoris ? Complete fodder to the bad guys.

As for the villains, the hacker guy is annoying as fuck, the Allan guy is just boring and one dimonsional, Majima is also pretty crappy villian, he has no motivation earlier in the series and dose nothing until he sees Chisato fighting once and he becomes the ""villian is obsessed with the MC because he saw them fighting once"" trope and then he reveals that his plan is to expose the normal civilians to what the government is hiding which is the finale and oh boy this finale had some of the dumbest writing I have ever seen.

So majima exposes the truth of Lycoris to the public through live TV and had guns distributed across public area, the regular citizens in this anime have a worse mentality than a toddler, one of them finds one of the guns majima distributed in a park and then sees a Lycoris girl nearby who he just saw them exposed as they fight bad guys on TV, and for some fucking reason, he couldn't resist the pressure or the urge to pick up the gun and shoots the Lycoris girl !?!?

Wtf was that, this has to be the dumbest civilian population I have ever seen in any story.

But things get worse, so the government reaction to the Lycoris being exposed and compromised is to send the ""Liliybells"" who are the male counterpart of the Lycoris, they send them to execute all the Lycoris !?!?

It's like the writers likes to write the most extreme reaction someone can do in this situation.

And then the fight of Chisato Vs Majima at the end where Majima says he has a bomb ready to explode to create chaos, but then the bomb is revealed to be a prank and just some fire works ?

Like his whole motivation as a villain is to cause as much chaos as possible to fight the government ""false security utopia"" but it's just a prank ? Did he chicken out or something ?

Dumbass villian, dumbass civilians and dumbass Government, that's basically this show finale arc.

Chapter 1: The Marriage Deal

Matthew Langford, a man in his thirties, carried a raw and unfiltered desire that was almost palpable.

Adriana Xander had lost count of how long he had been relentless. Her body felt as if it were unraveling, overwhelmed by a lust so fierce it left her gasping for air.

Matthew knew every inch of her intimately, his touch precise and deliberate. Not a single caress was wasted; his movements were smooth, practiced, and sure.

“Clear my schedule starting tomorrow. I’m taking the week off. Book two tickets to Neocoralis,” Matthew declared as he finally pulled away, standing beside the bed while slowly dressing.

Adriana shifted her aching waist, a spark lighting her tired eyes. “You’re taking me on vacation, Matthew?”

He paused, a slight frown crossing his face as he looked down at her. “I’m going with Natasha.”

Her smile faltered instantly, replaced by an awkward lowering of her gaze. “Okay, Mr. Langford…” she murmured, the words tasting bitter.

Noticing the sudden paleness that crept over her face, Matthew’s tone softened slightly. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.”

She met his eyes, forcing a tight, bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me. But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this… affair?”

Matthew’s expression darkened. He reached out to gently rub her head in an attempt to soothe her, then placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.”

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress,” Adriana said stubbornly, her gaze unwavering. She knew deep down he would eventually marry Natasha Jones.

“You’re jumping ahead. We’ll deal with that when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether this ends or not isn’t up to you.” Growing impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time before leaving.

As the door clicked shut behind him, Adriana’s ears rang with silence. The world around her seemed to fade away.

Adriana was an orphan. During her freshman year, her appearance had drawn the cruel wrath of Mia Langford, a wealthy girl whose bullying left Adriana deaf in one ear, with a crushed pinky toe, and almost blinded by a cigarette burn.

Someone had recorded the abuse and posted it online, sparking a scandal that engulfed the school.

The administration summoned the parents. Representing Mia was Matthew—her brother.

Perhaps to protect the Langford Group’s reputation, or maybe out of pity, Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first words he spoke to her were, “Don’t be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.”

Spineless. Pathetic.

Adriana had fallen for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fed every fantasy she held about love and safety.

She once believed he was her salvation. But now… he didn’t love her. He only refused to let her go.

At the Langford Group.

\*\*\*

Matthew had a meeting to finalize his handover. Natasha waited patiently in his office.

Soon, they would be flying to Neocoralis together, ready to spend seven romantic days side by side.

Adriana set a cup of coffee in front of Natasha, her chest tightening as if it were being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.”

Natasha glanced at her with a gentle smile.

She came from a privileged background, perfectly suited to Matthew. Childhood sweethearts, she exuded a refined, elegant aura. Born into wealth, she moved effortlessly with grace—just sitting there, her confidence burned into Adriana’s eyes.

Adriana knew she had lost. She never truly stood a chance.

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He only uses her to pass the time.

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office.

Confidence deserted her. The label of orphan, the weight of poverty, the scars left by abuse—all screamed insecurity from every fiber of her being.

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they return, the engagement will be announced. Both families have already given their blessing,” coworkers whispered in the pantry.

As Adriana poured herself a cup of tea, the boiling water suddenly splashed onto her hand, turning her skin bright red.

The cup slipped from her grasp and shattered on the floor. Startled, she hurried to run her burn under cold water.

Matthew and Natasha were getting married.

That meant she and Matthew were finished. And so was her internship at the Langford Group.

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. Jones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out.

She forced a bitter smile. Matthew… was merciless.

She knew this was deliberate. There were drivers available, but he chose her—to remind her of her place, to crush any foolish hopes she might harbor.

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies, just with different methods of breaking people.

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long moment before dialing a number she had once blocked.

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does that offer still stand?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

Marriage might be her only escape from Haldoria, and the only way to break free from Matthew.

“Think it through,” the man’s deep voice replied. “Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We’ll discuss the details.”",1,1763105543.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False

We're flying into Liberia and out of San Jose.  Beyond this, I prompted ChatGPT that looking for a fun and relaxing vacation, open to staying in a couple different locations, but not looking to be changing hotels daily.  This was what it came up with and wanted to 'gut check' this with you all and see if there is anything major I'm missing.



>Below is a smooth 3-stop itinerary designed specifically around your “not rushed, one main activity per day” preference — while giving your family three totally different ecosystems:

>1) Guanacaste Beach – dry, sunny, ocean fun  
2) Arenal / La Fortuna – rainforest + volcano + hot springs

Chapter 1: The Marriage Deal

Matthew Langford, a man in his thirties, carried a raw and unfiltered desire that was almost palpable.

Adriana Xander had lost count of how long he had been relentless. Her body felt as if it were unraveling, overwhelmed by a lust so fierce it left her gasping for air.

Matthew knew every inch of her intimately, his touch precise and deliberate. Not a single caress was wasted; his movements were smooth, practiced, and sure.

“Clear my schedule starting tomorrow. I’m taking the week off. Book two tickets to Neocoralis,” Matthew declared as he finally pulled away, standing beside the bed while slowly dressing.

Adriana shifted her aching waist, a spark lighting her tired eyes. “You’re taking me on vacation, Matthew?”

He paused, a slight frown crossing his face as he looked down at her. “I’m going with Natasha.”

Her smile faltered instantly, replaced by an awkward lowering of her gaze. “Okay, Mr. Langford…” she murmured, the words tasting bitter.

Noticing the sudden paleness that crept over her face, Matthew’s tone softened slightly. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.”

She met his eyes, forcing a tight, bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me. But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this… affair?”

Matthew’s expression darkened. He reached out to gently rub her head in an attempt to soothe her, then placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.”

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress,” Adriana said stubbornly, her gaze unwavering. She knew deep down he would eventually marry Natasha Jones.

“You’re jumping ahead. We’ll deal with that when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether this ends or not isn’t up to you.” Growing impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time before leaving.

As the door clicked shut behind him, Adriana’s ears rang with silence. The world around her seemed to fade away.

Adriana was an orphan. During her freshman year, her appearance had drawn the cruel wrath of Mia Langford, a wealthy girl whose bullying left Adriana deaf in one ear, with a crushed pinky toe, and almost blinded by a cigarette burn.

Someone had recorded the abuse and posted it online, sparking a scandal that engulfed the school.

The administration summoned the parents. Representing Mia was Matthew—her brother.

Perhaps to protect the Langford Group’s reputation, or maybe out of pity, Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first words he spoke to her were, “Don’t be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.”

Spineless. Pathetic.

Adriana had fallen for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fed every fantasy she held about love and safety.

She once believed he was her salvation. But now… he didn’t love her. He only refused to let her go.

At the Langford Group.

\*\*\*

Matthew had a meeting to finalize his handover. Natasha waited patiently in his office.

Soon, they would be flying to Neocoralis together, ready to spend seven romantic days side by side.

Adriana set a cup of coffee in front of Natasha, her chest tightening as if it were being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.”

Natasha glanced at her with a gentle smile.

She came from a privileged background, perfectly suited to Matthew. Childhood sweethearts, she exuded a refined, elegant aura. Born into wealth, she moved effortlessly with grace—just sitting there, her confidence burned into Adriana’s eyes.

Adriana knew she had lost. She never truly stood a chance.

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He only uses her to pass the time.

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office.

Confidence deserted her. The label of orphan, the weight of poverty, the scars left by abuse—all screamed insecurity from every fiber of her being.

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they return, the engagement will be announced. Both families have already given their blessing,” coworkers whispered in the pantry.

As Adriana poured herself a cup of tea, the boiling water suddenly splashed onto her hand, turning her skin bright red.

The cup slipped from her grasp and shattered on the floor. Startled, she hurried to run her burn under cold water.

Matthew and Natasha were getting married.

That meant she and Matthew were finished. And so was her internship at the Langford Group.

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. Jones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out.

She forced a bitter smile. Matthew… was merciless.

She knew this was deliberate. There were drivers available, but he chose her—to remind her of her place, to crush any foolish hopes she might harbor.

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies, just with different methods of breaking people.

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long moment before dialing a number she had once blocked.

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does that offer still stand?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

Marriage might be her only escape from Haldoria, and the only way to break free from Matthew.

“Think it through,” the man’s deep voice replied. “Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We’ll discuss the details.”",1,1763105443.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I recently got into the whole smart home thing, and one of the first questions I had was whether smart plugs were actually worth it or just another gadget trying to empty my wallet.

After using them for a few months, I can honestly say there's a pretty big difference between these things and your regular outlets.

**What Actually Makes Them Different?**

Regular outlets are just... outlets. You plug something in, it gets power. That's it. Smart plugs let you control whatever's plugged into them from your phone. Sounds simple, but it changes things more than you'd think.

I can turn off my coffee maker from bed if I forget. I can schedule my living room lamp to turn on before I get home from work. My phone charger automatically cuts power at night so I'm not wasting electricity. These are small things that add up.

**The Money Part**

Smart plugs cost more upfront, obviously. A regular outlet costs like nothing if you're just using what came with your house. But smart plugs can actually save you money on your electric bill over time. Devices left on standby mode still use power, and smart plugs can completely cut that off.

I checked out [a bunch of options here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and found some decent ones that weren't crazy expensive. Most of them work with Alexa or Google Home too, which is nice if you're already using those.

**Setup and Daily Use**

Traditional outlets require zero setup. Smart plugs need you to download an app and connect them to your wifi. It takes maybe five minutes per plug. Not hard, but it's an extra step.

Once they're set up though? Way more convenient. Voice control is actually useful when your hands are full. Automation is where it really shines – things just happen without you thinking about it.

**Should You Switch?**

Depends on what you need. If you're happy with regular outlets and light switches, there's no reason to change everything. But if you want more control over your energy use, like scheduling things, or just enjoy the convenience of controlling stuff remotely, smart plugs make sense.

I'm not saying go replace every outlet in your house. Start with one or two for things you actually want to control. Table lamps, fans, space heaters – stuff like that works great.

If you want to try them out, [check out some options here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and see what fits your budget. Start small and see if it's actually useful for your situation before going all in.

They're not magic, but they're pretty practical once you figure out what works for your setup.",1,1763105439.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

1owq54t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1owq54t/my_cousin_and_i_used_to_play_a_game_with_my/,My cousin and I used to play a game with my uncle’s Polaroid camera. I think something else is still playing it.,"When my uncle died, nobody knew what to do with his house.

He never married, never had kids. It was just him, his little two-story place on the edge of town, and his weird hobbies. He had been ""the strange uncle"" my whole life—the one who still used a landline, still collected VHS tapes, still had a paper TV Guide by the couch like it was 1998.

So when the lawyer told us he’d left the house to me, my first reaction was pure, selfish relief.

I was drowning in rent. I worked a crappy support job at a software company, taking calls from people who somehow managed to break things by turning them on. The idea of not having to split a one-bedroom with a stranger sounded like a miracle.

The house needed work, but it was structurally fine. Two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, creaky wooden floors. It smelled like dust and old coffee. It felt… lonely, but not in a creepy way. At least, not at first.

We started cleaning it out the Saturday after the funeral. It was just me and my cousin Lily, who’d been closest to my uncle besides me.

“He really didn’t throw anything away, huh?” she said, holding up a cracked lava lamp.

“Maybe he just thought everything would come back in style,” I said.

We laughed a little. It felt good to laugh.

The Polaroid camera was in the hall closet, on the top shelf, just where I remembered it.

“Holy shit,” Lily said, reaching for it. “Remember this thing?”

I did. When we were kids and got stuck at his house during family gatherings, we’d play this elaborate game where one of us would hide and the other would try to sneak around with the camera and take a picture without the other noticing. You got a point if you caught the other kid on film without them seeing you. Bonus point if they looked really scared.

We thought we invented horror photography.

Lily turned the camera over in her hands. “God, I loved this stupid thing.”

“Does it still work?” I asked.

She popped open the compartment. “There’s film in it.”

“Twenty-year-old film? That can’t be good anymore.”

“Only one way to find out.” She lifted the camera, pointed it at me before I could protest, and clicked.

The camera whirred and hummed and spat out a square. The picture developed slowly, colors muddy and washed out, but it was there: me, standing in the dusty hallway, mid-blink.

“Still works,” she said, satisfied, and set it on the entry table.

We went back to sorting boxes.

It wasn’t until later, when Lily had gone home and I was alone, that I opened the hall closet again and saw the photos.

Hundreds of them.

Stacked in shoeboxes, pinned to corkboards, taped to the inside of the door. Polaroids, all of them. It was like opening the door of some strange, analog Instagram addiction.

Most were ordinary: pictures of my uncle’s living room, his old car, his garden, stacks of books. A few were of people I recognized—me and Lily as kids, my mom, my grandmother before she passed.

But the majority were… backs.

People’s backs. People standing at the sink, hunched over the coffee table, bending to tie their shoes. Sometimes you could see a sliver of face in a mirror or window reflection, but usually it was just the back of someone’s head, the line of a spine through a shirt, shoulders drawn up or slumped.

All of them were taken from behind. All of them looked like the subject had no idea they were being photographed.

A weird, uncomfortable chill ran through me.

I told myself it was just his idea of art. Street photographers did candid stuff all the time. Maybe this was just his version, but… domestic. Creepy, but not illegal.

Still, I closed the closet door and tried not to think about it.



I moved into the house a week later.

At first it was almost nice. Lonely, yeah, but I kind of liked it. The creaks and groans became familiar. My uncle’s old recliner was surprisingly comfortable. I bought a thrift-store lamp, a cheap rug, tried to make it feel like mine.

The first few nights, I slept with the TV on because the silence felt heavy. But nothing too weird happened.

Until I woke up on Wednesday and found the Polaroid on my kitchen table.

I was sure I’d left it on the entry table by the front door. That’s where Lily had set it down. I hadn’t touched it since.

I picked it up, frowning, and found a fresh photo underneath it.

It was me, obviously. Sitting on the couch the night before, laptop open, blue light reflecting off my face as I scrolled through emails.

The photo was taken from behind.

I was wearing the same sweatshirt, my hair in the same messy bun. The TV was on in front of me, a blurry wash of light.

I stared at it, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

Okay. Okay, calm down.

There was a logical explanation.

I must have accidentally taken this. Maybe there was a timer function I messed with as a kid and forgot about. Maybe I somehow hit it while I was walking by and didn’t hear it over the TV. Maybe—

The rationalizations were flimsy even as I thought them.

“Lily,” I said out loud, relieved at the sudden possibility. She had a spare key. Maybe she was screwing with me. It was exactly the kind of shit she’d pull.

I texted her: **Very funny. You didn’t scare me, you just wasted old film.**

A minute later:  
**What are you talking about?**  
**The pic you took last night. Of me on the couch. Nice stalker vibes.**  
**I was at home last night? I worked a double, I was in bed by nine.**  
**You didn’t come by the house at all?**  
**No?? Why?**

I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting.

I sent her a photo of the Polaroid.

She took a minute to answer.

**Okay that’s actually creepy.**

**You really didn’t take this?**

**Dude, no. Why would that be my idea of a prank?? Burn that house lol**

I laughed, but it came out thin and shaky.

I put the Polaroid in a drawer, camera on top of it, and told myself that was the end of it.



The next one showed up two days later.

I was rushing to work, half-asleep, when I saw it on the small table by the front door: the Polaroid camera, and another photo underneath.

This one was me again, standing at the kitchen counter, pouring coffee into my travel mug. The angle was low, like whoever took it was crouched near the floor.

In the photo, my head was tipped slightly to the side. The back of my neck was exposed.

I ran my hand over that exact spot and felt goosebumps prickle on my skin.

I didn’t text Lily this time. I didn’t tell anyone.

Instead, I did the thing my uncle never would’ve done: I bought a security system.

By that weekend I had three motion-activated cameras set up—one by the front door, one pointing down the hallway toward the bedrooms, and one in the living room. I put the little yard sign out front: **PROTECTED BY SKYSHIELD SECURITY** like a charm against evil.

Just in case it wasn’t ghosts. Just in case some creep really was coming into my house at night.

The next night, I stayed up late on the couch pretending to watch TV while I kept one eye on the live feed from the cameras. Nothing. Just static, soft changes in light and shadow, the occasional flicker as the heater kicked on.

At 1:30 in the morning, my eyes burned. I finally gave up and went to bed.

I woke up at 3:12 AM.

Not because of a noise. Not because of a nightmare.

Because I suddenly felt… watched.

It was like someone had leaned over me while I slept. That suffocating awareness of another presence, inches away.

I lay perfectly still, heart pounding in my throat, and forced my eyes open.

The room was dark. The shadow of my dresser loomed against the wall, moonlight seeping through the edges of the curtains.

There was no one standing over me. No looming shape.

But the feeling didn’t go away.

I sat up slowly, flicked on the lamp, and scanned the room. Empty.

I slid out of bed, forced myself to walk down the hallway, past the dark bathroom and the empty second bedroom, into the living room.

The Polaroid camera was sitting on the coffee table, pointed directly at the hallway.

There was a new photo underneath it.

My hands were shaking as I picked it up.

It was me, asleep in bed, on my side, hair spilled across the pillow.

Taken from behind.

There was something else in the picture, too—something that made my stomach drop.

In the mirror of my closet door, you could see a sliver of the room. My back. The edge of my pillow.

And behind me, just at the limit of visibility, there was a suggestion of a shape. Darker than the rest of the shadows, a hint of height, a slight curve as if someone were bending over me.

I dropped the photo like it burned.

I grabbed my phone and opened the security app. My fingers fumbled with the password.

The hallway feed was empty. The living room feed, too. The time stamps ran smoothly, no gaps, no obvious glitches.

I rewound to 3:12 AM and watched myself on the bedroom camera (I’d put one in there too, after the first photo) roll over and sit up, then swing my legs out of bed and walk to the living room.

No one else. No shadows moving where they shouldn’t be.

And yet the photo existed.



I didn’t go to work the next day. I called in sick and spent the morning seriously considering booking a hotel and never coming back.

Instead, I did something stupider: I opened the closet with the shoeboxes again.

I don’t know what I was looking for. Confirmation that my uncle was just a weird artist. A note saying “lol got you” from beyond the grave.

What I found was a separate stack of photos, rubber-banded together, tucked behind the others.

They were all of the same person.

My uncle.

Sometimes he was sitting at the kitchen table with a newspaper. Sometimes he was in the recliner, head tilted back, mouth slightly open. Once he was brushing his teeth in the bathroom.

All of them were taken from behind.

Every single one.

In a few, you could see his reflection: a tired man with thinning hair, a worn face softened by age. In one photo, he was asleep in bed. In the mirror, behind him, there was the same suggestion of a shape in the shadows.

My hand went cold.

The last photo in the stack was different.

It was of the hallway, right outside the closet I was standing in. You could see the bedroom doors, the scuffed baseboards, the slightly crooked picture my uncle hung of a lighthouse.

It was empty.

Except for a pair of bare feet visible in the very bottom of the frame, heels turned outward, toes pointing directly toward the camera.

The skin on those feet looked wrong—too pale, veins like dark threads under parchment.

The angle was low, like the camera was on the floor.

Like something was lying on its stomach, looking up.

I shoved the photos back into the shoebox, hands shaking uncontrollably now.

I needed air. I needed light. I needed to not be inside these walls with… whatever this was.

I grabbed my keys and went to the front door.

The Polaroid camera was on the entry table, pointed at me.

There was a new photo underneath it.

I hadn’t heard it take anything.

I hadn’t seen the flash.

I forced myself to look.

It was me, standing in the hall closet, stacks of photos in my hands.

Taken from behind.



I didn’t leave the house.

I know how that sounds. I know every survival instinct should’ve had me sprinting down the street and never looking back.

But it felt like I’d already stepped too deep into someone else’s game. Like if I turned my back on the house now, something would crawl out of it and follow me.

Instead, I called Lily.

“Hey,” she answered, voice casual. “You alive?”

“I need you to come over,” I said. I hated how thin and brittle my voice sounded.

“You okay?”

“No.”

She didn’t ask more questions. “On my way.”

While I waited, I sat on the couch, the security feeds open on my phone, the Polaroid camera sitting on the coffee table between us like a third party in the conversation I wasn’t having.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Fifteen.

“Where are you?” I texted.

She didn’t answer.

Instead, I got a notification from the security app: **FRONT DOOR MOTION DETECTED.**

I switched to the live feed.

The porch was empty.

No Lily. No one.

My heart hammered.

Another notification: **HALLWAY MOTION DETECTED.**

The hallway camera feed clicked on.

The hallway was empty too.

The timestamp was live, the seconds ticking forward.

“Stop it,” I whispered, like I could scold the house into behaving.

My phone buzzed in my hand. New text from Lily: **Sorry, traffic’s insane, ten more minutes.**

A shutter sound made me flinch.

The Polaroid camera whirred.

My breath caught in my throat as it spat out a fresh square.

I didn’t touch it at first. I just watched the pale rectangle slowly darken, colors seeping in like blood through gauze.

When the image finally solidified, I almost dropped it.

It wasn’t the living room. It wasn’t me.

It was the front porch.

Taken from inside the house, through the peephole window in the door. I recognized the distorted ring of glass, the warped view of the street.

Lily was standing on the porch, one hand lifted mid-knock, her head turning as if she’d just heard something behind her.

The photo was taken from behind her shoulder.

I stared at the timestamp in the corner. My uncle had always loved writing on his Polaroids in that tiny, neat handwriting. The date on this one was scrawled in the border.

It was today.

Ten minutes from now.



I don’t remember making the decision. One moment I was staring at the photo; the next I was moving.

I put the Polaroid face-down on the coffee table. I grabbed my car keys and my phone. I dialed Lily as I shoved my feet into my shoes.

She picked up on the second ring. “Hey, I’m almost—”

“Don’t come to the house,” I said, already halfway down the hallway. “I’m leaving, I’ll meet you at the diner on Maple, okay? Right now. Just go there. Please, Lily, I’m serious.”

There was a pause. “Okay. Okay, yeah. You’re freaking me out a little.”

“I’ll explain everything there,” I said, and hung up before she could ask more questions.

I didn’t look at the security cameras. I didn’t look back down the hallway. I opened the front door and stepped out into the afternoon sun like I was surfacing from deep water.

Nothing grabbed me. Nothing whispered in my ear.

The air outside felt thin and too bright.

I locked the door behind me out of habit, sat in my car, and just… breathed.

I started the engine.

My phone buzzed with a notification.

Out of reflex, I glanced at the screen.

**New photo detected on Device: Hallway Cam.**

Against my better judgment, I opened the app.

The hallway feed snapped into view.

The door I’d just closed was there. The empty entry table. The closet door, shut.

And in the center of the hallway, just at the edge of the camera’s range, there was a shape.

Not a trick of shadows. Not a glitch.

Something tall. Bent at the waist in an impossible angle, like it was folding itself to fit inside the narrow hall. Its limbs were long and thin, hands resting on the floorboards like a person getting ready to crawl. Its head brushed the ceiling.

The frame froze.

The app crashed.

My phone went back to the home screen.

My reflection stared back at me from the black glass, pale and wide-eyed.

Something moved in the back seat.

Just a slight shift. The creak of old fabric.

I didn’t turn around.

I put the car in drive.

I backed out of the driveway, hands shaking so hard I could barely keep the wheel straight.

As I pulled onto the street, my phone buzzed again.

A text from an unknown number.

No message. Just a photo.

I opened it.

It was me, sitting in the car in front of the house, hands on the steering wheel, head turned slightly toward the phone.

Taken from behind.



I’m writing this from a motel two towns over.

Lily’s okay. We met at the diner. She thinks I’ve had some sort of breakdown. Maybe she’s right.

I told her some of it, the parts that sound the least insane. She made me promise to call a therapist. I promised. I don’t know if I’ll keep that promise.

The house is sitting there, empty, with all my stuff still inside. My uncle’s boxes. The shoeboxes of Polaroids. The camera.

I thought about calling a priest. A paranormal show. Burning it to the ground.

Instead, I just keep refreshing my phone.

Every few hours, another photo comes in from that unknown number.

Me at the gas station, putting the nozzle back.  
Me walking into the motel lobby.  
Me sitting on the bed, typing on my laptop.

Always taken from behind.

I checked the number once. No caller ID. No record.

It just says: **POLAROID**.

I don’t know who’s sending them.

I don’t know how far this game goes.

I only know one thing with absolute, cold certainty:

Zu mir: Ich bin hauptberuflich Softwareentwickler in DE angestellt und nebenbei selbstständig. Bisher hab ich eher kleinere Dev-Jobs gemacht, bisschen Webkram, Beratung, technischer Support, alles auf kleiner Stundenbasis, nichts Riesiges, aber solide.

Jetzt hat sich was Spannenderes ergeben: Ein kleines, aber eher kapitalstarkes Unternehmen hier aus der Nähe (DE, kein Hinterhofladen, gibt’s schon ein paar Jahre) will mit mir zusammen einen Shopify-Shop aufbauen. Die verkaufen Designer-Lifestyle-Zeug, u.a. importierte Sachen aus Japan und Specialty Coffee, wo das Kilo auch mal 70–100 € kostet. Der Shop soll nicht einfach ein Standard-Theme mit Logo sein, sondern schon eher custom und mit ihnen mitwachsen. Wichtig: Die wollen ausdrücklich keine Agentur oder irgendeinen Fiverr-Dev, sondern eine einzelne Person, die den Laden und die Produkte kennt und langfristig ihr Tech-Ansprechpartner ist. Ich bin da selbst schon länger Kunde und darüber auch an die Möglichkeit gekommen.

Ich ticke eher agil, hab wenig Lust auf „Pflichtenheft + Festpreis-Werkvertrag“, wenn eh klar ist, dass sich der Scope entwickelt, wir iterativ bauen und danach noch laufend Anpassungen, Fragen, Bugs, neue Features usw. kommen.

Mein aktueller Gedanke: Ich würde mit 70–75 € netto pro Stunde reingehen, ganz normale Stundenabrechnung mit sauberem Time-Tracking. Agenturen nehmen wohl zwischen 120-150 Euro die Stunde, daher denke ich, dass ich mit dem Stundensatz gut dabei bin.

Jetzt zu meinen Fragen an euch:  
Ist ein Stundensatz von 70–75 € für dieses Setup (Shopify, eher custom, kapitalstarker Kunde, langfristige Betreuung, ich als „ihr Tech-Mensch“) aus eurer Erfahrung/Meinung zu niedrig, okay oder drüber?  
  
Würdet ihr sowas eher über einen Dienst-/Rahmenvertrag mit Stundenabrechnung laufen lassen oder lieber mit einzelnen Angeboten pro Phase (Initial-Setup, dann später einzelne Features etc.) arbeiten?  
Letzte Frage, dann hab ichs auch: Wie regelt ihr dieses klassische „Meld dich einfach, wenn was ist“, ohne dass ihr am Ende halb auf Abruf seid und gefühlt ständig Kleinkram macht, der nirgends auftaucht und nicht direkt berechnet werden kann?

Ich mag die Leute wirklich und hab Bock, das langfristig aufzubauen, aber ich will es von Anfang an sauber und fair aufsetzen.

I have recently bought a new Elizabeth and wanted to use a bottomless portafilter instead of the double spouted one that came with the machine.

I had no leaks with the double spouted portafilter with the same basket but with the bottomless one there is always a leak. The first time I used 18gm of medium roasted coffee, i thought I may be overfilling the basket so I tried 17gms but leaked as well. 

I noticed that it leaks only after the pre infusion phase. When I purge water in the empty basket, it does not leak as well.

* For *transpo*, Grab lang ang gamit namin na app. Noong mga unang araw, may nakukuha pa kami discount, dahil siguro turista kami. Pero naubos din. We also used GSM (Xanh SM) one time. Pero mas convenient pa rin sa Grab talaga.
* For *food*, di naman kami masyado nagkakain sa sikat na restau. We only tried Tam Vi since hype na hype sa Tiktok. And di namin natype-an (ngek). Sana pala nag local food spot na lang kami.
* For *attraction,* included dito ang Fansipan peak tram, Hoa Lo prison ticket + audio guide, tickets to Temple of Literature, Vietnam Nat'l Fine Arts museum, at Ngoc Son Temple.
* For *pasalubong,* included dito ang pag-shopping sa Lotte Mart, local coffe stores (bought ground coffee, instant coffee, and tea), pati na din trinkets, magnets, and shirts we found while walking around Sa Pa and Hanoi.
* Miscellaneous gastos naman ay mga any-any na gastos gaya ng bayad sa CR sa stopover (going to Sa Pa and going back to Hanoi), withdrawal fee sa Agribank, pati na din ang nabasag na vase sa airbnb (LOL).

Overall gastos per person (2 lang kami) ≈ **₱ 48,739.**

Para sa aming itinerary, I'll include a screenshot of our planned vs actual na ganap for this trip. Check the first 2 photos na lang, 1st photo ay yung sumary ng aming itinerary, 2nd photo ay sample daily itinerary na prinepare ko.

**----------**

As for our immig experience, same with trip to Taiwan last May, wala na masyado tanong sa amin. Big factor siguro na 3rd trip na namin ito together, and bumabalik naman talaga kami sa Pinas. haha 

**----------**

**Mga** ***pulot*** **from this trip:**

* Plan your itinerary loosely para flexible ang mga ganap niyo. During our first day sa Hanoi, maulan talaga siya so hindi namin napuntahan yung mga plinano namin. So what we did ay nag indoor activities na lang kami (the activity being SHOPPING, ngek). 
* *Medyo* accurate ang weather app! Pag sinabi sa weather app na medyo sunny, sunny naman talaga. Noong nag Fansipan kami, ang pinaka worry namin ay baka magbago ang panahon. We were lucky na clear ang skies at maaraw during that day. Kasi before that, noong first half-day namin sa Sa Pa, maulan at ma-fog talaga. Same with Hanoi. Rainy ang forecast sa first day namin, then cloudy sa mga susunod. And accurate naman, except sa last day na ""cloudy"" ang forecast, pero maaraw naman with clear skies.
* Mag Fansipan kayo early in the morning. 7:45am ang unang funicular ride. Pangalawang ride na ang nasakyan namin pero maluwag pa din at at 3 4 couples lang kami sa cable car. Sa peak tram, diretso lang kami sa counter to buy roundtrip tickets. Pag akyat sa tuktok, nasulit namin mag picture at video kasi wala pa masyadong tao, and naabutan din namin ang flag raising ceremony. Noong pa-descend na kami around 10:30, sobrang dami nang tao, especially sa peak tram. Ikot na ang pila. Sakto din na 11:00am, nakababa na kami from the cable car at diretso na sa kaka-open lang na Van Sam restaurant to redeem ang buffet lunch na inavail namin kasama ng Fansipan tickets. Sulit!
* Try to look for unique food spots and attractions. Most of the time kasi yung mga nasa-suggest sa YouTube or Tiktok, either overhyped na or nagbago na ang quality ng food at ng place. May mga ilang restau kami na hindi na tinuluyan and pinalitan na lang namin ng local food spot na nahanap lang namin sa Google Maps. 
* Hindi ko alam if for that day lang, but on our first day sa Hanoi (Nov 8, Sunday), may ilang area around Hoan Kiem lake na sarado for cars and motorcycles. Bikes at pedestrians lang ang nakakadaan. Sobrang nakaka-happy maglakad-lakad at walang humaharurot na mga sasakyan. Perfect for family day talaga!
* Mas ok ang G8 Bus from our experience. Yung HK bus na nasakyan namin pabalik ng Hanoi, amoy kulob siya. So masakit sa ulo. awit
* DO NOT underestimate ang lamig ng Sa Pa. I've seen from Tiktok videos na akala nila parang Baguio lang. HINDI PO. Malamig na tagos hangga buto. So bundle up. Bumili ng heattech, at magbaon ng sweaters, jackets, gloves, at neck at head gear.
* If hindi kayo sigurado sa weather, pwede naman na on-the-spot na kayo bumili ng ticket. For example, yung Rong May Glass bridge ticket, sa KKDay namin binili on the same day na pumunta kami. Worried kasi kami na baka ulanin kami at di namin masulit yung bayad. Sa Klook sana namin bibilhin pero hindi pala pwede same day bilhin ang ticket. Take this into consideration din. Mapalad kami na maganda din ang weather noong nag sight seeing night bus kami sa Hanoi. We booked ang tickets for that noong October pa.
* Papunta sa Rong May at O Quy Ho viewdeck, nag avail kami ng private car service para walang hassle. Hinatid kami sa Rong May, tapos nagpa-drop off kami sa O Quy Ho viewdeck para magkape-kape, then final drop off sa amin ay sa isang cafe sa Sa Pa town. That is from 1:30pm to 5pm, for 600k dong lang! Super bait pa ng driver, at maingat sa kalsada. (Let me know if gusto niyong kunin ang WhatsApp contact number).
* SUPER sulit ng airport transfer na nabook namin sa Klook. Ang ganda ng sasakyan, lakas maka-mayaman, at on-time dumating ang driver. Walang ka-hassle hassle ang pag punta namin sa airport. Para kaming mga bossing. Mabango at malamig ang car, at very polite ang driver.
* Avail audio guides if you can. Na-appreciate namin ng sobra ang Hoa Lo prison tour because of it. Hesitant pa kami noong una kasi 100k dong din kaya isa lang muna ang inavail. Ending, nag avail pa kami ng isang audio guide for me.

If you have questions about our hotels, at pati na sa mga pinuntahan at kinainan namin, send a message lang or leave a comment.  TY for reading. :)

We’re restocking after close, just us in the IV room. She’s counting vials, I’m scanning bins. One glance her coat unbuttoned, collarbone glowing under red emergency lights and I lose it.  

I drop the scanner, grab her waist, spin her into the cleanroom wall. Hand over her mouth before she can speak. She freezes, then bites my palm and yanks my hair down to her level. Green light.  

Scrubs rip. I lift her onto the laminar flow hood vials clatter. No words, just teeth on her neck, hips slamming so hard the hood rattles. She claws my back under my gown, muffles screams into my shoulder, comes shaking with her legs locked around me. I don’t stop—flip her, bend her over the cart, finish while she’s whispering “I can’t walk” through gasps.

She looked exhausted, and before I even asked how she was, she said her coworker told her she’s “too soft.” All because she tried to keep a conversation calm instead of snapping back. I could hear the frustration in her voice, and honestly, I felt it too.

We started talking about how often women get labeled that way. You comfort someone? You’re emotional. You show empathy? Too sensitive. You stay calm? Must mean you can’t stand up for yourself. But when I think about the women around me, the strongest moments were always wrapped in some kind of softness. The friend who waits with you until your Uber comes. The girl who notices you’re about to cry before you say a word. The quiet check-ins, the “text me when you get home,” the little ways we protect each other.

Somehow, that gets treated like a flaw. But softness takes effort. You have to stay grounded, keep your boundaries, and still choose to be kind. That’s not weakness. That’s emotional weightlifting.

Before we left, my friend said she didn’t want to lose her gentleness, she just wished people would stop acting like it made her easy to push around. And honestly, same. I’m still learning that being gentle doesn’t mean I won’t speak up or walk away when I need to. It just means I won’t let the world turn me into someone I don’t want to be.",1,1763104373.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

It took me a long time to recover after our daughter’s birth, and my SIL was a god send. She was there from the moment I went into labor to the day my husband got home a week after the birth. After he was home, she would stop in almost daily just to make sure I was okay or to bring me a coffee or treat. My husband was also very involved and helpful as soon as he got home, however once I was back on my feet and “recovered” he changed. I became a single married mom almost over night. All the duties of caring for a baby, you name it, I was the only one doing it. I needed a more than 3 minute shower? SIL had to come over- I would never ask her but I’d come to the living room and there she was while husband was somewhere else in the house where our baby wasn’t. This has been our life for the last year and a bit. 

Recently at a family dinner, an aunt asked us when we were bringing another baby into the family. My husband responded with “when she will let me”. 

I reminded -with a laugh- my husband that we had been told that having another baby would be very deadly for me, and he responded with “we can’t let hypotheticals rob our daughter of growing up with siblings”. The whole table went silent. SIL was glaring daggers at my husband but he went on to talk about sports with his dad. The rest of the dinner felt strained and we went home and husband acted like nothing happened, but he has been dropping hints or flat out asking for us to have another child since. Fast forward to last week. 

SIL is a widow with a 4yr old son. She has been in school getting her medical degree since I married my husband. She took a break after her husband passed but is now graduating. She called my husband a few days after the awkward family dinner asking if we might consider taking her son for a week so she could go on a much needed vacation before her final exams. He agreed immediately without even consulting me. (I of course don’t mind but it’s still kinda rude he didn’t check with me first)

SIL left on her trip and the first night went pretty smooth. I was the one making the meals getting the kids to bed and my nephew off to school the next morning while my husband lounged around the house. On the second night as we were eating dinner, my husband smiled at all of us and said “look at how great we work as a family of four doesn’t this make you want to reconsider having another child”. I didn’t know what to say so I just laughed because was he actually thinking my life was so worthless to him?

He tried to bring the issue up again at bedtime, but fearing for how my temper would make me react I told him I had a headache and I went to bed. The next day was much of the same. I got the kids up. I got the kids ready. I took my nephew to school and my daughter and I hung out around the house while I cleaned and took care of my regular household duties while my husband worked. My sister-in-law checked in and I told her that things were going well, but that my husband was back on The getting me pregnant train no matter what the cost. She was obviously irritated and told me I should just leave the kids with him for the rest of the week and go treat myself and let him get a taste of what being a widower is actually like. At first I thought she was joking so I responded with a generic ha ha and what about the rest of my day. But that night my husband brought up us having another child again, and I reiterated that it was very dangerous for me to get pregnant and deliver another baby. He told me that he grew up without a mother, and it didn’t affect his childhood whatsoever as the rest of his family was involved and that my way of thinking was selfish, and I was robbing our daughter of growing up with a sibling. 

The next morning after my husband is at work, and my nephew was at school, phoned the babysitter that we use very rarely and asked her to come over and watch my daughter until my husband got home from work. I packed a small duffle bag of clothes and I found a hotel and I left. I kept my phone on until the babysitter texted to confirm that my husband had arrived home and then I turned my phone off. For the whole week. 

When I finally turned the phone back on I had over 400 missed calls and messages from my husband. I didn’t read a single one, and sent a quick “how was your week as a widow”

I needed leaders, not late nights.

It did not take her long to get into her very fancy and exceptional lifestyle and talked about owning property, a resort and she travels everywhere yada yada. She was basically very rich from what i could understand and she was about to go on a cruise and leave her appartment for a few months.

She kinda offered me to come and stay there while she is out as she needs someone to look after the house etc…

I did not promise anything but said i would whatsapp her (we exchanged numbers).

Through her speech i understood she does a very wide range of different activities and she knows rich and successful people. She seemed smart and cultivated as well we talked about geo-politics and stuff.

She told me i could come anytime to her appartement so that she show me her property and introduce me to her network.

I am a bit torn, if she was telling the truth all along i’d be very lucky to have that kind of connection but something just doesn’t add up. First, Why would you offer such a thing to someone you just met in a cafe?

I tried to check her in internet but haven’t found much, her company does not have a website. I forgot the name of the resort she said she owned but she said it was a very popular one. 

I have trust issues and do not believe things that are too good to be true, maybe she is rich but wants something in return? I dunno what to think honestly.

I started out with Flutterflow about 4 months ago after researching low-code no-code platforms with integrated AI. Flutterflow ticked all the boxes for me, especially because of it's local run feature, cross platform abilities and easy deployment to the google and apps stores.  
  
A few months later and I have a pretty strong MVP for my coffee price finding app (it's called BeanThere), that I've released! Super happy with that, and using the UI abilities within FF, the app actually looks decent too. That certainly wouldn't have been possible for me without Flutterflow.  
  
Now that the app is out there, I'd really like to start cleaning up the design elements. I'm not a designer, but I think I have a pretty good eye. I'd love to hear some opinions on how I can cleanup my shop detail page. There are a lot of elements on the page that I need to cover, such as:

Shop images, bookmark icon, like icon, check-in icon, name, ratings, open now status, shop tags, check in avatar, shop details, reviews, photos, coffee prices and digital loyalty card. See below for a screenshot of a typical shop page:

###Jonathan Johnson ✖️

###🆚

###Hagane Shinno ⚔️

#[JJ is X-Rated](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreihgyeikv2b7mvkze3e2vwcdmqfnceordnqkgmwvfgraeboutgnn4u@jpeg)

YouTube is about to get X-Rated, because “The Future” of Thailand pro-wrestling and IWA SETUP World Heavyweight Champ, **Jonathan Johnson**, has returned to Ichigaya! JJ kills it in every appearance, and while his those are rare, he is firmly part of the ChocoPro extended universe. This fiery youth has to be seen to be believed, but he’s got all the makings of a top star for the industry. The smooth way he moves is incredibly captivating, especially when flying through the air. You don’t hold gold that young without being an elite performer! If you’ve never seen him, prepare to be blown away by his explosive nature and roguish charm. He’ll be taking on someone who helped with the foundations of Thai wrestling in Hagane, but JJ is unfazed...despite also being fresh off fighting El Phantasmo! Remember, he was born to do this! *You should definitely check out SETUP, it’s a wonderful promotion that I am proud to support! Their star studded show that occurs just before this one (where JJ faces ELP) will be available to watch online roughly 10 days from today.*

While it might be autumn, prepare for a reminder that winter is cold and unforgiving. **Hagane Shinno** represents that freezing season with more than just his icy demeanor! This absolutely brutal striker has been nearly invincible in the series so far, a nightmare to face in singles combat (especially in ChocoPro)! His solemn ferocity makes him an instant favorite among new fans (with Hagane surprising most with his exceptional technical skill, emotionless demeanor, and explosive fighting style) while his byronic nature pairs well with his otherworldly eternal youth. Emi Sakura challenged Hagane to step up in this chaotic era, despite his reclusive nature, and he has done just that. He even stepped up to sub in (multi-classing as a bard, apparently) on 488. It is great to have the mysterious striker back in the regular rotation! Expect him to roll back the clock for a brutal training lesson from “Coach” Hagane.

###Dan the Dad ☕ & Tokiko “Otoki” Kirihara 💃

###🆚

###Shivam 🌟 & Chie Koishikawa 🏵️

#[The Dad & the King](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreigql2o3gzd2oegqtcnefvfijmq6rn2wuuozjwlta2ejk5mxgh3fh4@jpeg)

All of the kids rejoice, because **Dan the Dad** is back in ChocoPro! The coffee carrying father figure made quite the splash in his last appearance. He’s got a lot of life lessons to teach! Expect your Father’s Favorite Wrestler to impress, especially considering wrestlers that understand comedy always thrive in the Chocolate Square. Dan is an excellent technician, though he might need to finish his morning coffee during the match. It is really impressive how he manages to do so much while enjoying that mug of morning brown. *He’s a very entertaining guest that knocked it out of the park last time, so this should be a blast!* Meanwhile, get ready to shout “COMANECI”, because **Tokiko “Otoki” Kirihara** will be his partner. Otoki is considered Mei’s “Mom” in their rare tag team, so she kinda fits with a Dad. The ageless fighter, mountaineer, and underrated photographer is always a great support. Otoki is a straight forward combatant (with plenty of brutal attacks and bursts of speed) but also has a surprisingly sharp sense of humor! She is known for her hiking and heavy striking...but isn’t opposed to some slapstick (at the expense of her opponents). This dancing, kicking, Judo throwing, Showa Era fighter can go toe to toe with anyone put in front of her. Otoki has a killer style that utilizes a lot of her combat background, but she isn’t afraid of pulling out a classic cobra twist. All things considered, this is a great combo.

SHI-VAM! SHI-VAM! Another fresh off “A New Dawn”, also representing Thailand’s SETUP promotion, Janken King **Shivam** is effortlessly cool (and overwhelming in many ways)! *He’s a real global threat!* The visiting Ace oozes charisma, has a slick set of ChocoPro themed gear (to be fair, all his gear is awesome), and a flashy move set that will have you chanting his name along with the rest of us. This phenomenal talent manages to somehow excel in every category of pro-wrestling. He’s basically the ideal style of all-arounder, he makes every appearance memorable, and will have you wanting to seek out more of his work (which you should). He’ll be utilizing his prowess along side the girl with “Too Much Energy!” As ChocoPro Wrestling’s resident speedster, **Chie Koishikawa** has a killer pace, boundless potential, and a destiny beyond what any of us can fathom. Her charisma is unquestionable, with the Frantic Fencer warming the hearts of fans across the world with her emotional outbursts, quick alternative striking, and flamboyant style. The drama she brings is really next level (even in Janken after the show)! *Seriously though, if you are a new viewer be sure to check out how wildly expressive she is at all times. There is a reason she is one of the most popular characters in ChocoPro!* Her desire is rock solid and her passion burns bright. The shark girl is going to unleash those brutal strikes, tricky pins, and that blazing speed in an attempt to dash straight through her foes! This pair has a lot of potential. “Say Helloooo...to Chie-Vam!?”

###Right Bears!!! (Mei Suruga 🍎, Baliyan Akki ♠️, & Kaho Hiromi ⛵)

###🆚

###Team Hiyori (Sayaka Obihiro 💙, Hiyori Yawata ☁️, & JDL 🐓)

#[Right Back!](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreic6dnj43gcphblxu76zmn4xhbagce4rfrsq4tyfejppmvr6pzttv4@jpeg)

*They didn’t get to do this team up last time, so I’m just going to use it again!* The BestBros (**Mei Suruga & Baliyan Akki**) are “right bear” in Ichigaya! The circus-level synergy of the BestBros makes them one of ChocoPro’s top tag teams, and these two teaming with **Kaho Hiromi** makes total sense. She easily matches the team’s energy and enthusiasm, with a further dash of infectious mischief. First off, “Apple Goblin” Mei Suruga is a truly special talent. Ichigaya’s genius is a Pin Specialist and Submission Innovator with a vast ocean of charisma to match her relentless technical mastery. Someday the world will acknowledge Mei’s genius! Speaking of criminally underrated talent, Akki the Ace will be setting the bar for quality as always. His breezy strike combos and all around skills are unrivaled in the Square! Akki is a flying acrobat that can even control the ground (Keep an eye out for his brutal Kimagure Lock). He is their best bet against the unique trio they face, as Akki is ready for anything. Lastly, the Apple & the Ace will be joined by the latest prodigy of ChocoPro Wrestling. Sailboat Kaho is a quick and tactical student that astounds all manner of wrestling fans with her sheer creativity. She has a unique approach to the basics coupled with clever transitional setups to make up for her lack of size and power. It is always fun to see what she brings to the deep formula of the BestBros. Have they created any new triple team attacks? *When these three are together, the Trio is called “Right Bears!!!”*

Considering how important **Sayaka Obihiro** was to the genesis of **Hiyori Yawata**, this very blue version of Team Hiyori is always a fun one (and even more fun when bolstered by **Jake De Leon!**). These two will seek to deepen the synergy formed from their passionate bond (definitely check out their singles match back at New Dawn, Episode 479!). A certified chef and the beating Blue Heart of ChocoPro, Obi is a whirlwind of energy and sparking magnetic personality. Her unorthodox combos, blistering heavy chops, and sudden pinning flurries are staples of the wild thrill that is “Sprint” Obihiro. She supercharges the audience with her humor, fury, and fluid technique...and you’ll quickly see why she is called the “Soul” of the promotion. Meanwhile the artistic, camera-loving, and delightfully defiant Cloud Girl Hiyori Yawata continues to blaze a chaotic path through ChocoPro with her signature pom-pom hat, boundless enthusiasm, and indomitable drive. Her unique presence (inserting herself as much as she can), wrestling instincts (throwing off the veterans equally so), and magnetic connection with the crowd all point to another rising star in the making. Lastly, the Senyorito, JDL, will be the latest addition to Team Hiyori! *You don’t really get a choice, in the long run. She’s another REAL GLOBAL THREAT!* Once again, the Filipino Fighting Rooster will be showing off just how great “Mr. Philippine Wrestling” is. It has been a while since his last appearance during the “Hashtag Japan De Leon Tour”, but this warm personality has an effortless technicality that fits in at Ichigaya with ease. Even if he’s a bit rotten this time...but I guess that only makes him fit in more. *He’s the IWA Japan Tag Champ (come back to ChocoPro soon, Andruew Tang!) and Dexcon World Champion (and the Setup Thailand 24/7 Champ, I believe!) as of this writing, so many belts in the show today!* Expect him to hit that great smile and prove that RGT (and by extension JDL) is truly everywhere! *They don’t take part...they take over!*

*ChocoPro Wrestling is a free online & promotion (that also runs ticketed live in ring shows) run by AEW's Emi Sakura, that often takes place in the legendary Ichigaya Chocolate Square! It features a steady pace of Episode releases, fan interaction, long story arcs, and much more! A place where the turnbuckles are replaced with 14th floor windows, the ropes are replaced with fans, unforgiving walls provide creative avenues for skills otherwise unthinkable, and you can take solace in knowing that the referees usually do nothing. While it might be a shocking change at first, the intensity and storytelling will leave you wanting more. Think of it like the Hart Dungeon but as a promotion, if that helps!

My Ex (25M) and I (26F) were friends for a year turned best-friends in 2020 then lovers in November 2021. 

We were together for 2 and a half years but I broke up with him. I won’t go full detail but I know some of our arguments were immature on both sides and we were just two really young kids learning to love each other for our first real relationships. I know we’re each others first love and first real relationship we’ve always chose each other but I had bad trust issues with him that I won’t fully go into detail other than that it wasn’t that big of a deal our communication just wasn’t that great. 

I broke up in 2023. And we were in super super soft and little contact that entire time to 2024. 

In August 2024 I tried dating someone but I realized after a month or so later on that dating him was to fill the void of my ex. I wasn’t ready i still loved my ex and I didn’t realize that at the time cause I thought a year was a perfect time to try but it didn’t work because that guy I tried dating was cheating on me with his ex (of 8 years) the entire time while dating with me.

In Late December 2024 i knew I loved my ex and still do so I broke no contact with him. 

we started off as friends playing video games and texting and hanging with each other in January 2025.

 and I told him in the beginning that I wasn’t ready for a relationship at that moment I wanted to build towards one and he said he doesn’t mind he knows he wants me and knows I want him so he will be here building with me. 

Then it turned into more in March we were going out to eat together, going to fun places, we started holding hands and eventually turned into cuddling this entire year of 2025. We had sex one time though I wanted to do it more I just never initiated and our bedroom life wasn’t that great but it didn’t bother me. Then in September things got more serious We FaceTimed every day or night. We slept at each others houses almost every other weekend and showing up at each others family events and work events. His whole job knew about me and my entire job knew about him. 

Everyone was happy that we found our way back to each other again but they were confused as to why we haven’t made it official yet and stuck in a situationship when we act like a couple already. I was waiting on him to ask me and I guess he was waiting on me to bring it up neither of us did. Our communication on that part wasn’t the best And that’s where it takes a turn…

In October he took me to the pumpkin patch 3 times in different weekends, super surprised and spoiled me on my birthday, bought me flowers and coffee all the time our last date even him surprising me wirh flowers and coffee was on October 18th. 

but on October 24th-26th he started randomly getting distant, he barely texted, didn’t call, and promised me he’d come stay over at my house but didn’t two days in a row. He said no cause he wanted to play video games.. 

Then on October 27th I texted him what’s wrong, he tells me he doesn’t know what he’s feeling and confused.. while he stopped texting me I guess he took our pictures and my anniversary gift that was in his living room down in a different room and invited a girl over to his place and had intercourse with her on his living room floor with no protection. 

He calls me after she leaves and says he doesn’t know how to tell me this on call so he’s gonna come over in person next morning. Next morning comes and he is crying about how much he hates himself and told me what he did and showed me everything and answered every question I had. He said it was 100% lust and he wants me. 

So I figured out from him and looking on my own, she is a coworker of his (he talked about her once to me and said how dumb she is at his job cause he was training her) he added her on every gaming platform, steam, discord, World of Warcraft, Fortnite, and Instagram and Snapchat. they were playing video games October 19th til she said she wanted to do stuff with him and that’s when he invited her to his place while ignoring me. He said he felt like it was cheating too which is why he’s broken about it as well. 

Since then it’s been about 2 weeks now he’s deleted her off everything and has a new job position so he never sees her anymore, he called her and told her about how he had a girl and closed that door with her. 

He’s been trying to work with me and we’ve been going on dates, he’s called out of work a few times to come console me and show he’s here for me. But I told

Him I can’t be back into a Limbo 50/50 half in half out again while healing. I want to be in a relationship 100% and I’ll be able to heal. But he doesn’t wanna rush into a relationship he says he wants to build again and for me to build trust with him again first he wants to take it slow so we don’t get into an argument and explode. 

I just can’t heal without knowing I’m 100% what he wants it’s a security thing for me so I put my foot down saying it’s either relationship or not because I can’t keep sitting here in the half foot in half foot out situation again because we’re already doing everything a relationship does just without the label what’s the difference between building again when we’ve done it this whole year. I blamed myself for not communicating that I should’ve said relationship. But he didn’t even give the respect to communicate first before sleeping with another girl. 

I feel it’s unfair of me to have to sit here and wait for him to be ready when he’s the one who slept with another girl. It just feels like he actually doesn’t want me and trying to keep me until he makes up his mind. He swears that’s not what it is he just wants to build and be happy with himself first because he feels I deserve him at his 100% best and he doesn’t wanna mess us up.

TL;DR:

My ex and I dated for 2.5 years, broke up in 2023, and slowly reconnected throughout 2024–2025 until we were basically acting like a couple again. Neither of us formally asked for a relationship, so we stayed in a “situationship” even though it felt exclusive. In late October, he invited and slept with a coworker at his place. He told me the next morning, cut her off, and has been trying to show up for me since. But now he wants to keep “building slowly” before making things official yet again, but I feel I can’t heal or trust him without the commitment. It feels unfair to wait for him to be ready when he’s the one who slept with someone else. ",1,1763101505.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

This is not the best LRE, there is no data, and no one talked to me or my coteacher about 4 periods.
