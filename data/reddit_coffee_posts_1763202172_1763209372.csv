1oxq8ef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxq8ef,Making my buildings neater,"Hi all.

I don't actually own a rail set up, but a friend of mine is a little skint so I'm working on some 00/1.76 scale buildings for his set up.  I'm a scale aircraft and miniature figure builder and painter, and not a very good one tbh, but I'd like to make him something that he will be able to use. I've put together a couple from thick card and used brickwork paper for the walls. Made recesses in the wall so there's some depth, and matchsticks, and bits of coffee stirrers for the trim - but, it still looks tatty. 

Where the corners meet, the paper just kind of ends, and looks like paper stuck to the card. I put a green trim around those areas, but I still don't like it.  I'm sure beggers can't be choosers, but if I do something, especially for a friend, it needs to be done right. 

Any suggestions on how to make the brickwork corners meet up neatly would be greatly appreciated. I can't be putting a trim all the way around. ",2,1763208885.0,ModelTrainScenery,0,1.0,False

1oxq74d,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1oxq74d/networking_omg/,Networking omg,"So after 5 full months of unemployment I finally got a job (yay!), and the journey has not been easy. 

Ive been thinking of a career transition into project related jobs in a corporate environment. In my previous jobs I didn’t have that much exposure to large scale projects or programme, but I am confident in my capabilities and adaptabilities, and I’ve got relevant certificates. 
I thought as long as I highlighted my strengths and experience and tailored every single application I’d get a job easily. Omg I was so wrong. 

I’d spend at least 1 full day writing one cover letter, some even took me 3-4 days. Mixing the wording from the ad with my own voice to keep the genuineness, having friends check my applications, and upskilling through online courses etc. I’d also write follow up emails saying things like “hey I put a lot of thoughts and coffee into this application”, BUT most of the time all I got was a generic rejection email. My applications just seemed never landed on the manager’s desk. 

After 22 rejections I thought, fck this aint going anywhere, so for the first time I asked my friend who works at the organisation I’d applied a job to whether they happened to know the manager’s email address so I could send the follow up directly to the manager instead of the recruitment team. 
My friend went “oh we are on the same floor, let me go and have a chat with them!” And BOOM 30 mins later I was talking to the manager, and 4 days later I got an offer. 

Faaa no wonder some people on LinkedIn keep saying networking is everything eh. Kinda ironic but tailoring cover letters just seems less important even tho recruiters always stress about it. I’m ofc thrilled to be getting back in the workforce but faaa a 2-min chat through a connection did MORE for me than all that time and effort of perfecting my applications lol. Faaa.

So, here's to all you Mecha Man/Invisigal fans.*

  
It’d been a long day. Well, the last four days had been long days, damn long. He could feel them in his bones, in all the countless bruises that checkered his body in a patchwork of greens and blues and purples. In the dozens of small cuts that itched because they were starting to mend under adhesive tape. 

By the time Robert got to his door, his shoulders felt like they were made of rebar and wet sand. The corridor still smelled faintly of smoke and bleach. The whole building did. Maybe even the whole damn city. 

Repair and reconstruction were in full swing back at SDN, and across the city, and coordinating the team for that was almost as stressful as letting them handle villains. 

He spent most of the day routing Z-Team through reconstruction jobs: holding up unstable walls with hard-light, clearing rubble, patching power lines, keeping tempers from boiling over. Once again, he’d been a hero from a headset while others did the heavy lifting. But they were doing good. Real good. Despite the vacancy he - very hard - tried not to think about. 

His key stuck in the lock, like it always did. He jimmied, swore under his breath, and it gave in. Robert let the door snap shut after giving it a kick and put Beef down, who directly rolled onto his back. 

“Already wanting to sleep again, buddy?” he muttered and bent to ruffle the dog’s ears. “Did you help save the city today? Did you write three requisition reports about parking permits? No? Then you’ve got no reason to be so tired, Beef.”

He rose again and placed the brown paper grocery bag on the kitchen counter, blinking his eyes to adjust to the apartment’s twilight. Somehow, somewhere, Bruno had organized a big mattress the other day, letting him upgrade the sleeping arrangement from plastic garden chair to couch, and now to actually-could-become-a-bed. Besides that, the apartment still looked like shit. Barren. Mismatched. Damaged. He caught a reflection of himself in the kitchen sink. Almost poetic. 

Figures. 

For a moment, he fumbled with a fresh bag of dog treats. His fingers were bandaged, somewhat numb, and fine motor skills were not an overworked and sleep-deprived Mech Man’s best trait. Beef looked up at him, expectantly, tubby tail wagging, oblivious to Robert’s struggles with modern wrapping. “Come on,” he muttered, then let go of something that started as a frustrated moan and turned into a long yawn. His eyes teared up a bit, and he blinked, and to his surprise, he found he had actually managed to open the package. The treats were bone-shaped, but when he bowed down to give one to Beef, his trusty little sausage tilted his head, peaked his ears, and listened. Then, with a velocity most people wouldn’t have thought possible from the chubby dog, he did a one-eighty and ran past the edge of the kitchen counter, sniffing the air with rapid little huffs, nails ticking on the floorboards.

Robert’s hand went to where his utility belt *wasn’t*. Right. No suit at home. Just him, a tired guy in sweat-stale clothes.

“Beef?” he called. “Buddy?”

Something was off. Tensing his tired muscles like a coiled spring, moved past the kitchen counter. Late afternoon light leaked through blinds, slicing the space in gold and shadow. Dust made tiny halos in the air. They swirled when he walked through them, scanning the room. Nothing was broken, no window was pried. 

Beef was planted in front of the far corner of the room, his tail slowly swishing. Not stiff, not growling, not in ‘Little Sausage Attack Mode’. Just leaning forward, sniffing at…

Nothing.

He knew that sniff. A whole avalanche of emotions - anger, grief, sadness, desperation, but also hope - washed over him in just one tiny second. When he pushed himself up again, his face was calm in a mockery of the turmoil inside of him.

“I know you’re there, Courtney,” he said quietly. “Stop holding your breath. I know how taxing it is for you.”

For a heartbeat, the only sound was the far-off wail of a siren, somewhere outside.

Then the air in the corner *shimmered*, like heat over asphalt. It condensed, outlined, and suddenly there she was: hood up, eyes ringed with bruised shadows, hair flattened on one side like she’s been sleeping in it for days. A backpack slung one-shoulder, and one hand white-knuckled around a cheap plastic inhaler. She exhaled in a shaky rush. 

Beef immediately stepped forward and sniffed her ankles, tail wagging faster now that the “intruder” had a shape.

“Traitor,” she muttered down at him, voice raspier than he remembered. She reached out and rubbed behind his ear with two fingers, and Beef, oblivious to human drama, leaned into it, blissed.

Robert didn’t move. In the half-light she looked… smaller somehow. Not physically, but compressed. Coiled. Not for combat, like him. Like if he blinked, she’d either vanish or run like lightning.

“You know,” he unfurled his fist, his voice carefully casual. “Most people knock.”

Her mouth twitched. It wasn’t quite a smile. “Most people don’t have keys,” she answered, flicking her gaze past him. “You still hide the spare above the fire extinguisher, by the way. Super secure, Mr. Mecha Man.”

He should have said, *That’s supposed to be for emergencies*. He should have said, *This is breaking and entering*. He should have said a lot of things. What came out was, “You kept the key.”

She looked at him for the first time properly. For half a second, all the deflection dropped and there was just raw, exposed *something* in her eyes. Then the shutters slammed back down.

“I keep a lot of things I shouldn’t,” she said, her voice flippant, but without genuine humor. “Surprise.”

He noticed the backpack more now. It hung heavy and rigid on her shoulder. Something hard edged the worn fabric near the bottom; a corner or a curve?

The mask, his brain supplied. *Shroud’s* mask. Of course. He forced himself to slowly let go of the tension in his muscles. He had no inclination of there being a fight. In fact, he was just happy she was there and alive. 

But his throat was dry. “There’s beer in the fridge, Courtney. And we both look like we really could do one. So, uh, you wanna sit? Or you just standing in my corner being ominous all night?”

She snorted, the sound clipped short, like even laughing hurt. “I’m not here long,” she told him, but she stepped forward anyway, dropping onto the far end of the couch. 

Robert quickly grabbed two cold beers from the fridge, never fully taking his eyes off her, as if she would vanish the second she was no longer in his field of view. Back again, he lowered himself onto the other cushion, and the old couch dipped under their shared weight. Beef hopped up between them like a furry demilitarized zone and turned in a circle before flopping down, head in her lap, hind legs on Robert’s thigh.

For a few beats, none of them spoke. The city hummed outside, battered but alive. Somewhere, a drill rattled in the distance, reconstruction crews still going in the late afternoon. There’d be some hefty overtime bonuses coming for construction workers in the weeks ahead. 

Invisigal’s fingers curled into Beef’s short fur. 

Robert could see the fine tremor in her knuckles and the paleness of her skin. “You look like crap,” he told her, gently.

“Thanks, *babe*,” she fired back, but without heat or venom. “You really know how to woo a girl who murdered a guy for you.”

The word landed between them like a dropped wrench: *murdered*.

For a long moment he just stared ahead, then took a sip of beer. It was icy, and did absolutely nothing to soothe his mind. “He was trying to put a hole in my brain,” he turned the bottle in his hands, not looking at her. “You know I’m not… I’m not mad you stopped him.”

“Yeah?” She tips her head, watching him sidelong. “’Cause from where I was standing, you looked pretty mad I did it the way I did. “I even took your only opportunity to avenge your father from you. *And* proved to you I’m a villain,” she added bitterly.



“You saved my life, Visi!” Robert shot back. “Shroud was about to shoot me. I was out of my suit, and only had Beef in my arms. He’d have killed me if you hadn’t killed him first. Do you want me to yell at you for keeping me alive? Fuck, Visi, you killing him doesn’t make you a villain. Shroud was responsible for countless deaths all across LA. *He* was a villain. He killed *my father*. Had me tortured. Tried to kill me.” He let go of a deep breath he hadn’t realized he was holding in. “I’d have killed him myself, Visi. Hell, I told Chase as much before it all went down.” He looked down at the cold beer bottles in his hands, then up at her face again. “Sometimes, being a hero means doing what is necessary rather than what is good. Shroud got out of jail before; he’d have gotten out again. Killing him was the right choice. I’m only sorry that *you* had to make it, not me.”

 

He held out the other beer bottle. 



Invisigal studied it for a moment like an exotic animal, unsure what to do with it, with the whole situation. Wearily, she picked up the bottle and took off the mask that had covered her mouth.

“Fucking sure Blonde Blazer would disagree.” She took a sip but kept her eyes on him.



“Eh, instinctively yes, but Mandy’s pretty pragmatic at the end of the day.” His met hers. “She cares about you, Visi. A lot,” he told her quietly, smiling sadly. “You know, when I cut Coupé from the team, Blazer told me that even if you’d been last on the list, she still wouldn’t have cut you. She’s always believed in you.”



“And look where that got us.” Invisigal looked away and reached for the inhaler. She tapped it against her palm instead of using it, like she was punishing herself. “I know how this plays, Robert. I know which part I’m supposed to be in your head. The… catalyst. The tragic almost ex. The lesson.” Her voice frayed, and she looked away, jaw working. “I walked out,” she continued, quieter. “I know that. I made my choices. I’m not here to-,” she waved a hand, searching for the word,“ audition. For ‘Team Rebuild’. Or for… you.”

Robert swallowed. “Then why are you here?” he asked, the question sounding far simpler than it had a right to.

She opened her mouth. Closed it. Her fingers twisted tighter in Beef’s fur, but the dog huffed contentedly, unbothered.

“I don’t know,” she finally said, and he could hear it was the truth, naked and small. “I was halfway to the state line yesterday. Had a bus ticket. Backpack, cash, a really shitty motel on the map.” She sighed a breath, sounding unsure of herself and the world. “I made it as far as the terminal doors, and my chest locked up. So I went back to the crappy little room, put Shroud’s Halloween prop on the table and just… stared at it all night.”

Her hand shifted, and Robert heard a faint clink from the bag.

“It doesn’t shut up, you know,” Invisigal looked at him from the side. “The mask. Not literally, don’t freak out, it doesn’t have a voice. But when you put it on, it… pushes. Shows you what you *could* do. What goes wrong if you don’t. All the ways people screw you over if you give them an inch. It makes sense. Too much sense.”

Robert’s fingers curled on his own knee. “You wore it.” It wasn’t a question.

“Couple times.” She shrugged, entirely too casual to reflect her true feelings on the matter. “Just to see. Just to see what kind of girl kills a monster and then keeps his face in her backpack.”

“And?” Robert asked before he could stop himself.

She looked at him then, full-on, no dodge. “And I didn’t like her. But she makes some good arguments.” She took a sip of her beer, a big one. 

Silence settled again, deep and uncomfortable. 

Robert’s bottle was half empty when he spoke again, but felt twice as heavy. “Courtney,” he said softly. “When I didn’t untie you in the lab, when I… when I went around you instead of with you-”

She flinched like he had reached across the couch and slapped her. “Don’t, Robert. Don’t do the whole ‘I was wrong, actually, hindsight is twenty-twenty, come back, all is forgiven’ speech. I know how that episode ends.” Her face softened, if just for a blink of a second. “You’re a great dispatcher, Robert, but you suck at lying.”

He got up, because it suddenly felt as if the couch was suffocating him. He paced once, twice, the length of the little living room. Cuddled with Invisigal, Beef watched him, confused, head swiveling. 

“See, that’s where you’re wrong, Visi,” he shook his head. “I’m a pretty shitty dispatcher. Z-Team was about redemption, Visi. But I knew too little of all of you to help you properly. So I applied the same rules to everyone. But I was so wrapped up in my own fights. In trying to become Mecha Man again. Finding Shroud. I missed that everybody ticks differently. That you were trying to help, but only knew your way of doing it: someone who’s been stigmatized and used and taken advantage of her whole life.” He grimaced, and she looked away. “I should have realized that as your dispatcher. I should’ve damn well recognized it as your friend, Visi.” He paused and stared at his hands for a split second. When he continued, his voice was a hoarse whisper. “I should’ve fucking seen it as the man who fell in love with you, Courtney.” He looked at her then, pain in his eyes, pain that flooded to the forefront from reservoirs inside of him he had not known existed, and he blew out a breath, laughing at himself, tired. “All of it. There’s not a version of this where I say the perfect thing and the mask turns into a pumpkin and we kiss and roll credits.”

“Pretty sure we already did the kissing bit,” she muttered, looking anywhere but at him..

“Yeah,” he said, a small, sad smile flickering. “That part was actually pretty good.”

She ducked her head, and her shoulders loosened by a millimeter.

“Shouldn’t have left you tied up. But I was so pissed, at everything, and things kept happening, that I never got to really consider what you’d told me. I only saw that you had the pulse. If it’s any consolation, I got drenched in piss as a reward,” he joked weakly. 

For half a heartbeat, nothing. Then Courtney’s mouth twitched. 

“Kinky,” she snorted, a short, ragged sound.

“Not my thing,” he said with something that was almost a laugh. “Zero out of ten. Do not recommend.”

He was still on his feet, a little in front of the couch, beer bottle hanging from his bandaged fingers. She and Beef were sunk into the cushions behind him. Her hood shadowing her face, one hand in the dog’s fur, looking like she might fold in on herself and disappear into the fabric.

The almost-laugh died quickly. And the silence that followed had weight.

Robert scrubbed his bandaged fingers over his face, feeling the sting where adhesive pulled skin.

“I’m… sorry,” he said.

Courtney’s gaze flicked to him, sharp and wary, like he’d just pulled a weapon. “There it is,” she said flatly. “I was wondering when we’d get to the apology arc.”

He shook his head. “You didn’t let me finish.”

“Pretty sure I’ve heard the director’s cut.” She leaned back, propping one elbow on the couch arm, mouth twisting. “You were under pressure. You misjudged. You’ve got trauma. You didn’t mean it. You’ll do better next time.” She counted on her fingers. “It’s fine. You almost died. You’re allowed to want to feel better about yourself.”

“Courtney.” His voice cut through hers, steady but not loud. She stopped, jaw clenched.

He took a breath. “This isn’t about me feeling better.”

She opened her mouth to argue. He beat her to it.

“I have to live with what I did,” he said. “With *not* trusting you when it mattered. With tying you to a chair instead of standing next to you. With making you feel like Shroud was right about you.” He swallowed. “Nothing I say is going to magic that away. I don’t get to absolve myself just because I’m sad about it.”

She stared at him, lips pressed tight, like she didn’t know where to put that.

“I’m saying I’m sorry,” he went on, slower, “because *you* deserved better than that from me. From your dispatcher. From your friend. From the idiot who fell in love with you.” His fingers tightened on the bottle; glass clicked softly against his ring. “I’m not asking you to forgive me. I’m not asking you to say ‘it’s okay.’ I’m not trying to move this from the ‘Robert fucked up’ column to the ‘no big deal’ column.”

She blinked, thrown off for a second.

“I’m saying I’m sorry,” he continued, slower now, picking his words like his life depended on where they landed, “because I know how your brain works. I know there’s a little bastard in there who takes every bad thing that happens and writes it down under *Courtney’s Fucking Fault* in permanent marker.”

Her shoulders hunched, the tiniest flinch.

“You’ve already blamed yourself for the bomb, for Chase, for Shroud, for being poor and sick and desperate enough to work with him,” Robert said. “What I did in that lab? Me not trusting you? That’s on me. You don’t get to add that to the pile as proof you’re poison. I am not letting you turn my bullshit into another reason to hate yourself. That’s why I’m apologizing.”

She stared at him like he’d switched to another language.

“So yeah,” he said. “I’m sorry. Because you deserved better from me. As your dispatcher. As your friend. As-” He swallowed, the word sticking but coming out anyway. “As the man who, for some fucked up reason, loves you. And you didn’t get better. You got *me*. And that’s not on you. For once in your life, I really, really need you to not make *my* failure a new reason to hate yourself.”

Her throat worked. Her eyes were too bright, her jaw tight enough to crack.

“That’s not how it works,” she muttered, staring at the beer bottle like it might bail her out. “You don’t just… assign blame like a homework group project. I was there. I lied. I held onto the Pulse. I walked out. I killed Shroud. The common denominator’s me.”

“Yeah,” he said. “You were there. You made choices. Some of them were catastrophically bad. I’m not taking that away from you. But not everything awful that’s ever happened around you is automatically your fault by default.” He wet his lips. “Sometimes people just treat you like shit because *they* are shit.”

Her jaw clenched, a muscle jumping.

“You already carry enough,” he added, voice lower. “You don’t get to carry *this,* too. Not this one. That’s mine.”

She let out a breathy almost-laugh. “You really think one sorry is gonna fix twenty-seven years of… all this?”

“No,” he said. “But I hope maybe it puts one tiny crack in the story that says you deserve everything bad. That’s all.”

She stared at him for a heartbeat, then shook her head hard, like she could physically dislodge what he’d said. “I can’t…” she started, then stopped, teeth sinking into her lower lip. “I can’t stay for this. I can’t sit here while you talk like that. Like I’m…” Her mouth twisted. “Like I’m salvageable.”

“Of course you are,” he said softly.

She flinched like he’d burned her.

“Don’t,” she said sharply, pushing herself up. Beef grunted as her lap vanished, then slid to one side, confused. “Don’t say that. Don’t look at me like that. You don’t know what you’re signing up for.”

He watched her stand, watched her grab the backpack strap with white-knuckled fingers. His own free hand tightened.

“You don’t have to go,” he said, quietly pleading. “You can. But you don’t have to.”

“I do,” she snapped, stepping around the coffee table, heading for the door. “You’ve got a whole city to patch up and a boss who actually believes in you. You don’t need the girl who keeps lighting fuses in your living room.”

“Courtney—”

“You did your good deed,” she steamrolled over him, breath starting to go shallow. “You gave me a drink, you listened, you apologized, you said the L-word, very brave, ten out of ten character development. Roll credits. This is the part where I exit stage left and you get a nice montage about moving on.”

He took a step toward her. The bottle in his hand suddenly felt wrong, out of place. 

“I’m not looking for a montage,” he said. “I’m looking for-”

“For a happy ending,” she bit out. “You’re Mecha Man. A hero. That’s your thing. You drag the broken villain into the light and suddenly she’s fine. Newsflash, Robert: I don’t get fine. The kind of person who straps a bomb to you doesn’t walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand.”

His chest hurt. “Fucks sake, Courtney. You’re not just the bomb.”

“Yes, I am,” she said, more quietly now. “That’s the problem.”

He saw a familiar flash in her eyes.

“Courtney, don’t-!”

She flickered and vanished. One moment she was there, eyes blazing, body ready to bolt; the next there was only empty air and the faint sway of the backpack, then a dull thud as it hit the floor where she’d dropped it to move faster.

Beef barked, high and confused, spinning in a little circle.

There was no time to talk, or think. He listened instead. There — the tiniest scuff of a shoe against floorboards, the whisper of displaced air near the side of the coffee table. If he hadn’t spent hours upon hours listening to the way she moved over comms, he’d have missed it.

He didn’t think. He dropped the bottle.

It hit the hardwood with a dull clunk and rolled away, beer sloshing out in a foamy line. His hands were already moving, arms sweeping out in a desperate, wild grab where his brain screamed she had to be.

He collided with something that wasn’t empty air.

His arms closed around the shape of a body he couldn’t see. The impact knocked the breath out of him; it knocked something out of her, too — a tiny strangled sound, half wheeze, half protest, right against his bruised sternum.

He locked his arms, one hooking high around shoulders, the other cinched low around her middle. Invisible muscle and bone strained against him, twisting, bucking.

She fought like a cornered animal.

Her elbow drove into his ribs; white-hot pain flared through bruises, made his eyes sting. She writhed, trying to drop, twist, slip out of his grip; he followed, clumsy, stumbling, dragging both of them a half-step toward the wall rather than let her tear free.

Beef barked again, frantic, hopping at their legs.

“Courtney,” he gasped, tightening his hold. “Stop-”

She couldn’t dare answer. He could feel the locked-tight panic in her body, the rigidity of held breath. Her hands scrabbled at his arms, fingers finding every tender, taped-over cut, prying, digging, desperate to get away.

“I’m not—,” he wheezed as she drove them another step, his shoulder slamming into the wall hard enough to rattle the cheap picture frame there. “I’m not trapping you. I swear. I just— I can’t watch you vanish again.”

She jerked, harder. His grip slipped an inch. Fear knifed through him. He did the only thing he could: he held on. “Please,” he said, voice low, pressed close to the invisible hinge where her neck met her shoulder. “Please, Courtney. Don’t go.”

She struggled harder, almost hearing the protest she couldn’t voice in the way her fingers clawed at him, in the way her whole body screamed *let me go* without sound.

“Breathe,” he whispered, realization cutting through the adrenaline. “You’re gonna pass out. Courtney, breathe.” He felt the moment she hit the wall — not the painted plaster behind him, but the one in her lungs. Her body convulsed in his arms, a full-body jolt of need.

She broke. Air rushed into her in a ragged, horrible gasp she couldn’t hold back. Her invisibility shattered with it.

She flickered back into existence in his arms, like a glitch resolving: the hood, the wild eyes, the flushed, panicked face. Her fingers were still hooked in his sleeves; her chest heaved, fighting between the urge to stay unseen and the urge not to suffocate.

“Let go!” she rasped, now that air and voice were back, the words shredding her throat. “Robert, let me fucking go!” She tried to kick his shin; Beef yelped and darted out of the way, freaking out.

He shook his head, breath coming fast. “No. I am not watching you disappear into some motel room to talk to that mask alone until it sinks its claws in. I can’t.”

Her eyes widened, fury and terror tangled up. “Too late,” she shot back. “That’s already who I am. You don’t get to save me from myself, okay? That’s not how this works. You’re supposed to *hate* me. That’s how this story goes.”

Her voice cracked on *hate*.

He shifted his stance, bracing, letting her spend herself against him. An invisible elbow jabbed his ribs; he grunted, but held.

“I don’t,” he said. “I don’t hate you.”

“WHY?” It ripped out of her, raw. She stopped pulling for a second, just long enough to slam the word into him. “I strapped a bomb to you. I lied to you. I nearly got Chase killed. I killed *him*.” Her voice went lower, hoarser. “I walked away from you. You’re supposed to be yelling. Or throwing things. Or… or handing me over to Mandy. Not—” Her voice wobbled again. “Not saying you love me. That’s not… that’s not what happens to people like me. 

“Maybe it should be,” he said, quietly.

“That’s not—” She dragged in a fast, ragged breath around the edges of a sob. “You don’t get it. I *am* the bomb, Robert. I go off. That’s what I do. You hugging a grenade isn’t noble. It’s just stupid.”

“Maybe,” he said. “I’ve done a lot of stupid things for people I care about.”

“Stop it.” Her voice went smaller. “Stop saying that. Stop… making it sound like I’m worth—” The word strangled halfway out, turning into a broken noise. “Worth anything. I’m a fucking wreck!”

“We’re both wrecks,” he snapped, the words out before he could stop them. His voice shook as much as hers. “Have you *seen* me lately? I am nothing but bruises and bad decisions held together with duct tape and caffeine.”

That pulled her up short for half a second. She stared at him, breathing hard, eyes searching his.

“You’re still the hero,” she said, but the certainty had a crack. “You’re… you. You get to fix things. I break them.”

“I break things too,” he said. “I broke you in that lab. I broke your trust. I broke the whole damn promise of the Phoenix Program for you. That’s on me. And I am *not* gonna watch you take the pieces and carve ‘this is proof I’m unlovable’ into your bones with them.”

There was a long, shredding moment where he didn’t know which way it would go. His hand screamed. His ribs ached where she’d driven an elbow. He could feel her deciding, somewhere behind the invisibility and the old scripts.

“I’m not trying to drag you into some picture-perfect redemption arc,” he went on, softer but no less fierce. “I am not standing here because I think if I hug you long enough, you turn into a damn Disney princess. I’m standing here because when you run, you run straight into the arms of the worst stories about yourself. And I,” his voice wobbled, “I can’t make those stories vanish. But I can offer one other voice. Mine. Right here. Saying you don’t have to go alone.”

Her lips trembled and she swallowed hard. Her face was a mess. Eyes red-rimmed, wet, and her mouth clenched so tight her lips had gone bloodless. She looked like she was standing in front of a firing squad.

“That’s not fair,” she whispered. “You don’t get to… to say things like that and then stay. That’s not how this works.”

“Maybe we need a new way it works,” he said, holding on tight. “Because the old way has just been you getting hurt and me pretending I’m less broken than I am.”

Her face crumpled.

“Hey,” he murmured into her hair. It smelled like stale shampoo and dust and the faint metallic tang of the city. “Hey. You don’t have to list the charges. I know. I know.”

“I don’t know how not to screw everything up,” she sobbed. “I don’t know how to be anything but-” Another brutal breath. “But this. And you’re gonna wake up one day and realize you’re hugging a bomb and then you’ll… you’ll look at me the way they all do and…”

He tightened his arms around her, just a fraction. Not to stop her. To hold her together.

“Maybe,” he said, blunt and honest. “Maybe I will. Maybe we both will. But right now, tonight, I am choosing this anyway.”

She let out a sound that wasn’t quite a sob, wasn’t quite a laugh. Her hands had stopped pushing; now they just clutched at his jacket, seeking something solid.

“I don’t know how to stay,” she whispered. “All I know is running, and disappearing.”

“I know,” he said, and he could feel something wet in his eyes. “So we’ll… figure it out. Badly. Together. One breath at a time.”

Something in her went soft and sharp all at once. The last of her fight bled out in a shudder.

Her legs suddenly didn’t seem to know how to hold her. She sagged in his arms; his bruised knees locked to keep them both upright for a second, then gave. They sank, clumsy, to the floor, backs hitting the side of the couch. He kept his arms around her the whole time, pulling her in as if he could shield her from gravity.

That was when she really started to cry.

Not the tight, tearless kind she’d managed before. This was loud and ugly and raw. Her face pressed into his chest; a noise tore out of her that sounded like it had been waiting years for a way out. She shook against him, her whole body heaving.

He held on, one hand cradling the back of her head, the other banded around her back. His own chest hitched. They were both broken things, wrecked. Both filthy with dog hair and sweat and everything they’d done wrong. 

“I’m sorry,” she kept gasping against him. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry—”

“Me too,” he croaked into her hair. “Me too. So much.”

“I don’t know how to fix it,” she sobbed. “Any of it. I don’t know how to be anything else.”

“I know what you *think* you are. And I am still here. I am not here because I think you’re secretly a saint who got a bad edit. I am here because you are you. Because you are trying. Because you came back when you could have run,” he said, voice rough. 

Her face crumpled, a fresh wave of sound tearing out of her.

“That’s not fair,” she gasped. “You’re not allowed to just— just say that and expect me to— to *believe* you. I don’t… I don’t know how.”

“I know,” he said. His thumb brushed a tear track away; another one immediately took its place. “You don’t have to know how right now. You don’t have to believe me tonight. You just have to stay. That’s all I’m asking. All you’ve gotta do is *not* run.”

Her fingers bunched his shirt so tight he could feel the seams strain. “I’m so tired,” she whispered, the fight going out of her voice. “I’m so fucking tired, Robert.”

“I know,” he said, and meant it more than he’d meant anything in his life. “So rest. We can figure the rest out later. Tomorrow. Next week. Whenever. Tonight is just… this.” He shifted, easing them both down so they ended up half-kneeling, half-sitting against the side of the couch, his back taking some of her weight. 

Beef, sensing the storm had changed, crept closer and shoved his warm, worried body against their legs, whining softly. Courtney’s hand fumbled blindly down until she could curl her fingers into his fur too, as if anchoring herself to both of them.

Her sobs slowly shifted, from violent, tearing explosions to smaller, jagged waves. His own breathing evened out with hers, both of them wrecked, both of them still there.

“You’re safe,” he murmured eventually, when she was more gasping than crying. “Right here. You’re safe. I’m not going anywhere.”

She sniffed hard, hiccuped, tried to drag a sleeve over her face and only succeeded in smearing things around.

“You’re such an idiot,” she mumbled, voice raw and thick.

“Yeah,” he said, letting out a shaky breath that might have been a laugh. “Takes one to love one.”

She made a wet, hiccuping noise that might have been a laugh. Or a sob. Or both.

He rested his cheek lightly against the top of her head, eyes closing, arms still around her, not as a cage but as a promise.

Neither of them knew what came next.

But right now, four days after the world had almost ended for them, with the city still humming and bleeding outside his dusty windows, she was here. In his arms. Not invisible. Not running.

THAT TARRIFFS RAISES PRICES! WHO KNEW!,"[Trump Administration Prepares Tariff Exemptions in Bid to Lower Food Prices](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/trump-tariffs-food-prices.html)

Trump has officially solved the grocery price crisis by undoing his policy that caused it. He is incredible, inspiring and heroic...... If you ignore literally everything that happened before this week.

After months of insisting that tariffs would make America tougher, stronger, more self-reliant, and maybe even better looking, Trump has now reversed course and lifted tariffs on over 200 food imports. Beef, coffee, bananas, cocoa, tea, tomatoes and tropical fruit will all magically free from the “patriotic surcharge” he slapped on them in the first place. It’s like watching a firefighter proudly hose down the house he just set on fire — then demanding applause because, hey, the water pressure was phenomenal.

Here’s the twist that shocked absolutely no one with half a brain cell, **TARRIFFS RAISE CONSUMER PRICES.** That’s *common sense* but the administration treated the idea like it was some fringe conspiracy theory whispered by “globalists” and kindergarten math teachers. After grocery prices climbed, voters complained by electing Socialist Zohran Mamdani did Trump suddenly have a revelation that maybe taxing imported food is… bad. Amazing, call Bibi and tell him to amend his nomination of Trump for a Nobel, it should now be for PEACE and ECONOMICS.

The reversal isn’t being framed as a mess up. It’s being sold as a strategic adjustment driven by exciting new trade negotiations because nothing says “carefully crafted policy” like retroactively undoing your own rule before the ink is even dry. Let’s be honest: this isn’t about protecting American wallets so much as protecting poll numbers. When voters are choosing between paying rent or buying steak, even the most die-hard tariff evangelist has to consider the possibility that maybe the tariffs were not the best idea. the foods being un-taxed now are precisely the ones Americans actually consume. The stuff that fills carts, lunchboxes, and IG brunch stories. Turns out you can’t win hearts and minds by making people’s morning coffee cost as much as a studio apartment in Manhattan.

This is a walk-back of a bad idea that was loudly sold as genius. A policy that punished the very people it claimed to help. A trade war that was more like a food tax with a patriotic sticker slapped on top. So here we are, with tariffs quietly peeled back so grocery prices stop spiraling but don’t forget who started the death spiral in the first place.",7,1763208226.0,BreakingPoints,2,1.0,False

I have attached a photo of the living/dining space (imagine it’s empty as it’s the real estate photos) we don’t move in for a few weeks.

I have also attached a photo of my current sofa.

I was going to get a black oak flute style dining table (attached) as well as a matching coffee table and entertainment unit as these are all currently in stock at most furniture outlets.

However the only leather dining chairs I can find are lighter in colour to the sofa, and I’m not sure if this is going to cause issues or still work. I want some input if there’s a better alternative to make this all work together.

The only thing that can’t be changed is the sofa.

Appreciate all the help!

I’ll be in New York City from December 15th to 18th, staying in the Upper West Side. It’s my fourth visit, so I’m hoping for something a little different this time — fewer landmarks, more genuine moments, good coffee, and good conversation.

I’m shooting on a Fujifilm X-M5, and I’d love to connect with a few fellow Fuji shooters while I’m in town. Even an hour over a cappuccino to “talk shop” — film sims, lenses, favourite corners of the city — would be a welcome way to spend part of the trip.

I also have a model friend available for one of the days, so if anyone would like to tag along for a relaxed, collaborative street-style shoot, you’re more than welcome.

If you’re around and feel like meeting up, wandering a few blocks, or simply talking photography in a city that practically breathes it, I’d love to hear from you

1oxproh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1oxproh/how_do_you_deal_with_insecurities_in_your/,How Do You Deal with Insecurities in Your Relationship?,"Curious about something. Despite my age I’m new to dating or being in a relationship. Not currently in one. For those in a relationship how do you manage insecurity if your guy is surrounded by women? 

An example of an insecure thought. He broke up with me but we’re casually talking. He was honest with his expectations going forward and that it’s not what it used to be. He is not interested in me or my life to a big extent but says he likes me. 

I saw something funny today someone sent me and thought of sending it to him but I didn’t. I was a few girls he likes on social media posting stories about their life and one of them with provocative poses and my chain of thoughts went, “I don’t think it’s the right time to initiate conversation right now cuz I know he follows them and he would be distracted by seeing all of this he wouldn’t been be in the mood to look at anything I sent or is in the mood to even talk to me”. And I felt better about not sending anything. 

But it made me think about how other women do this. I really want to know. Do you just pick a man from the get go who doesn’t follow women on social media for example? What if his job entails meeting a lot of women and he’s the type that has a soft side to women in general. Like he may not hook up with them but he’s charismatic and his personality attracts a lot of women in general. He also has a flirtatious/bantering side which makes it easy to approach him unlike other guys for example I met in my life who are very guarded. 

Examples of things that triggered me in the past when I was with him, a girl wants to try his helmet (customer). I walk in and find one of them sitting on his bike and he’s taking selfies of her cuz she asked and putting on his helmet. 
Him saying he can’t go out with us because one in particular is always there around him. 

Stuff like this. 

I used to feel more secure before when he felt whenever I’m secure and then verbalized to me what I mean to him and how special I am to him in comparison to all these other girls. I still got triggered because I needed more validation whenever I felt insecure. I admit this was my mistake. When he was trying I felt I needed more. In my defense I’m not experienced so this is all new. 

Eventually he distanced himself and broke up with me but now he basically downgraded the relationship after I told him I could try casually seeing him. 

But I’m struggling a lot. I went from being insecure in a more serious relationship to being casual where he doesn’t hide his interest in other girls anymore. 

I’m really having a hard time accepting his change with me. This for me is the biggest pain. Seeing myself treated like a priority to something not that significant anymore. He doesn’t do me favors like he does with other girls. He lets his staff handle stuff I do when he got me so used to him being my person and he would help me with everything I need and whenever I need. Hearing things like “I’m never busy for you” “you’re my rest” “you’re so special and to me” “I want you in every way”. 

Everything is new to me now. And just the little shocks I get. I literally feel like someone slapping me every time I see the different way he speaks to me or treats me now. He’s not rude. And he gives solid reasons for him being busy but he’s also not getting out of his way to treat me in a special way. 

I know there’s a possibility I might feel seeing him casually is something I can’t do long term and he himself probably knows this. He’s not interested in me more so he’s not trying to fight for me or make me believe in what I have with him. “Take it or leave it” attitude. 

But I want to know for me—myself. If I meet someone later and fall in love again. How? How do I deal with things like when I see him say to a woman to stay longer or he’s happy to see her the next day and I’m not getting the same the same treatment. 

Is it simply your men make sure you’re always validated so when and if you see him giving someone a special treatment you don’t get jealous?

I noticed for example one of the girls I used to be very insecure about who’s a friend of his, telling him she won’t stay cuz she wants to go have coffee. And I know she did it because I was there. It was her way of telling him “she trusts him maybe or giving him space”. She knows he dumped me so there’s no reason for her to feel insecure maybe. He on the other hand couldn’t allow himself to be alone with me. The moment I came back with coffee for his staff and I got one for him, he told me to go call her and the friends to sit with us and chat. 

What makes a guy want to be this committed or considering towards a woman? Is it just love? 

I don’t even know what I’m asking. But I want to know how does insecurity work in your relationship? Do you tell your guy to give you validation? Does he do it himself without asking? 
When does a guy do this? From the moment he meets you? Or does he need to be sure about you? Fall in love with you first? 

And how do you deal with insecurities in your relationship? When and if you see a trigger or feel triggered, can you explain to me how do you go about addressing it?

I wake up, make coffee, open my laptop... and then the entire day feels like it runs me instead of the other way around. Tasks blur, time slips, and by evening I feel exhausted without knowing what I actually did. A month ago I tried something embarrassingly simple. Before touching my phone or opening a single tab, I sit down with a small notebook and write three sentences:

1. What absolutely needs to happen today  
2. What can happen if I still have energy  
3. How I want to feel by the end of the day

It takes maybe one minute. But somehow it changed the entire tone of my mornings. Instead of reacting to everything, I actually set the direction. And weirdly enough, when I decide in advance that I want to feel calm or proud or steady, I make choices throughout the day that match that. Another unexpected thing happened. I stopped carrying the whole day in my head. When I get overwhelmed, I just look at those three sentences and it resets me. No huge system, no calendar overhaul, no productivity hack. Just a tiny anchor I return to. I’m not suddenly hyper disciplined or someone who wakes up at 5am. But for the first time in a long while, my days feel like they have shape instead of noise.

1oxpp99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxpp99,Creating an App to Backup and Digitalise Typewritten Text,"I'm a writer and a few months ago decided I would write my next novel with a typewriter. I bought one... then I bought 8 more because... if you're on this subreddit, you know why. They're amazing!

I quickly ran into a problem though. I wanted to backup all my written text daily to my computer. I tried a myriad of existing solutions, but honestly, none did exactly what I wanted. Most OCR left much to be desired and most flows were too complicated. I just wanted to take pictures of the pages and have them sync to the cloud neatly organised into folders. I wanted to have all the pages added to a folder to be joined together when exported, making chapters. I wanted to access them both in my mobile and on my desktop computer and I wanted to be able to see both the page and the extracted text side by side to make sure all was extracted correctly and quickly make edits if not. I also wanted something that automatically could correct common typewriter mistakes and also erase the words I had ~~striken through~~. I also wanted to easily export to multiple formats, including markdown. Maybe I wanted too much, but this was the missing piece in making my writing flow with a typewriter perfect.

On a morning of desperation, I decided to just build it. I'm an AI engineer, so that helped make the decision. I'm posting now because I have built most of it and have been using it daily and I'm honestly super happy with the result. I can just snap a few pictures and make a cup of coffee while the text is extracted and uploaded and then I can go to my computer and make sure all is correct. And most times, I don't need to edit anything!

Unfortunately, to have great text extraction with error correction and also cloud sync, this doesn't come free. I have to call a few APIs and have a database running to sync things up. For the past 3 weeks, I scanned roughly 100 pages and it cost me slightly less than $3.

This leads me to the question I want to pose to this sub-reddit: would such an app be something you would like made public? Knowing that I couldn't make it free? I would be happy to publish the app in app stores and make the desktop webapp available as well if a few of you would be interested. I would also be happy to add more features and capabilities that you need and request. 

This is already a wall of text, sorry for that! Do let me know if anyone would be interested and if so, what extra features would make your typewriter flow easier! If you have an android and are curious to use the app, DM me and I can create a test version in the app store and share it. Happy to let you use it for free for a while in exchange for feedback. If I can make anyone else's writing flow easier, I'd be a happy man!

Reddit’s Insider Breakdown – Himalayan Asia Treks,"The **Annapurna Circuit Trek** is one of the most iconic trekking experiences in Nepal, attracting adventurers from around the globe. If you’ve ever scrolled through **Reddit trekking forums**, you’ve probably seen countless debates about the real cost of this trek. From budget hikers to luxury seekers, costs can vary dramatically. In this post, we’ll give you a detailed, insider breakdown of what to expect when budgeting for an **Annapurna Trek package in 2025**, based on real experiences and Himalayan Asia Treks’ expertise.

# 1. Factors That Affect the Cost of an Annapurna Trek

The cost of an Annapurna Circuit Trek depends on several key factors:

* **Duration of the trek** – The standard trek takes about 12–18 days, but short versions (7–10 days) or extended circuits (up to 21 days including Tilicho Lake or Upper Mustang) can change costs.
* **Type of trekking package** – Options range from budget, tea-house lodges, mid-range comfort lodges, to luxury or guided private tours.
* **Inclusions** – Packages may cover accommodations, meals, guide & porter services, permits, transportation, and sometimes flights. Some offer extras like hot showers, Wi-Fi, or cultural experiences.
* **Season** – Peak seasons (Spring: March–May, Autumn: September–November) can be more expensive due to high demand, while off-peak trekking is cheaper.

# 2. Budget Trekking Costs

If you’re a **budget traveler**, you can expect:

* **Accommodation**: $10–$15 per night in tea houses along the trail.
* **Meals**: $10–$12 per meal, though prices rise slightly at higher altitudes.
* **Permits**: ACAP (Annapurna Conservation Area Permit) $50, TIMS card $20.
* **Guide/porter (optional)**: $35–$45 per day for a guide, $25–$35 per day for a porter.

**Total estimated budget cost for 12–15 days:** \~$900–$1250.

Redditors often point out that **DIY trekking** (without a package) is cheaper but requires careful planning, especially in terms of permits, accommodation, and altitude safety.

# 3. Mid-Range Annapurna Trek Packages

Mid-range packages are ideal for trekkers who want **comfort without breaking the bank**:

* **Accommodation**: Tea houses with private rooms, some with attached bathrooms. $15–$55 per night.
* **Meals**: $10–$15 per meal, often including breakfast.
* **Guide & porter services**: Usually included.
* **Transportation**: Airport transfers, bus or private jeep to starting point (e.g., Besisahar, Chame).
* **Permits**: Included in the package.

**Total estimated mid-range package cost:** $950–$1,400 for 12–15 days.

According to Reddit posts, mid-range packages are the most popular as they combine convenience, safety, and local support. Himalayan Asia Treks’ mid-range Annapurna packages typically include **experienced guides, comfortable lodges, and cultural experiences**, which makes the trek far more enjoyable and stress-free.

# 4. Luxury Annapurna Trek Packages

Luxury Annapurna Trek packages are for trekkers seeking **comfort, convenience, and curated experiences**:

* **Accommodation**: 3-star or boutique lodges, private en-suite rooms with hot showers.
* **Meals**: High-quality meals, often continental options.
* **Guide & porter services**: Highly experienced guides, sometimes multiple guides for large groups.
* **Transport & logistics**: Private transfers, sometimes even helicopter pickups or luxury jeeps.
* **Extras**: Cultural tours, spa access, Wi-Fi, trekking photography services.

**Total estimated luxury package cost:** $2,000–$3,500+ for 12–15 days.

On Reddit, travelers often highlight that **luxury packages remove the stress of trekking logistics**, which is worth the cost if you’re short on time or prefer comfort at high altitudes.

# 5. Hidden Costs to Consider

Even with a package, there are a few **hidden costs** Redditors frequently discuss:

* **Tips**: Guides and porters usually expect $5–$10 per day.
* **Snacks & drinks**: Tea, coffee, and bottled water are extra, especially above 3,000 meters.
* **Phone & Wi-Fi charges**: Some lodges charge $2–$5 for Wi-Fi.
* **Altitude medication**: Diamox or emergency oxygen if needed.

Factoring in these extras can add **$150–$350** to your total budget.

# 6. Insider Tips from Reddit Trekking Communities

1. **Book early for peak season** to lock in rates.
2. **Negotiate local guides** if not booked through an agency—but Himalayan Asia Treks’ packages often provide safer and more reliable experiences.
3. **Check what’s included**—some “budget packages” don’t include permits or transportation, which adds cost.
4. **Consider altitude and fitness**—a package with a trained guide is worth the price for safety.

# 7. Final Thoughts: What Does an Annapurna Trek Package Really Cost?

Here’s a quick Reddit-style summary of **average costs** for a 12–15 day Annapurna Circuit Trek in 2025:

|Package Type|Estimated Cost (per person)|
|:-|:-|
|Budget|$600–$1150|
|Mid-Range|$1150–$1,400|
|Luxury|$2,000–$3,500+|

The truth? The **“real” cost** depends on your comfort level, trekking style, and the season. Himalayan Asia Treks’ Annapurna Circuit packages provide options for every type of traveler, whether you want a **budget adventure** or a **luxury trek with full support**.

If you’re planning your 2025 trek, the key is to **choose a package that matches your experience, budget, and safety requirements**—and yes, investing in a good guide often saves money and stress in the long run.",1,1763206837.0,Annapurnatrekinfo,0,1.0,False

1oxpg93,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1oxpg93/the_energy_reset_that_finally_worked_for_me/,The Energy Reset That Finally Worked for Me,"Last year, I realized I was completely physically drained. Every day felt like I was running on fumes. Whether it was crashing in the afternoon, needing coffee just to function, or feeling exhausted despite sleeping 8 hours, my energy was consistently terrible.

It wasn't just about feeling tired... I was irritable during normal activities. Simple tasks felt overwhelming, exercise seemed impossible, even getting through a conversation required effort.

So I decided to do something different: an energy reset. I knew I had to retrain my body to produce natural energy instead of relying on stimulants and quick fixes. It wasn't perfect, but it worked better than anything else I've tried.

Here's what helped:

1. **A 30-Day Sleep Priority**: I started by establishing a consistent sleep schedule over the first two weeks. I didn't change everything overnight, but I set strict bedtimes and wake times even on weekends.
2. **Redirect Energy Crashes**: Every time I felt the afternoon slump, I went for a 10-minute walk or did light stretching instead of reaching for coffee. It sounds small, but it made a huge difference in breaking the caffeine dependency.
3. **Strict Meal Timing**: I set up eating windows that were consistent breakfast within an hour of waking, no eating after 8 PM. It's wild how much better you feel when your body knows when to expect fuel.
4. **Relearn Rest**: At first, resting without screens or stimulation was hard. But over time, I realized real recovery happens in stillness. Now, I actually look forward to those quiet recharge moments.

It's been a few months, and I feel more energized, stable, and alive than I have in years. I'm still not perfect some days, I skip my routine and crash hard. But overall, I've learned that having consistent energy is about respecting your body's natural rhythms.",2,1763206262.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

My thumb was just moving. My brain felt crowded in a way I couldn't explain. So I put the phone down, turned the radio off, and just stood there listening to the sound of the kettle. It felt uncomfortable at first. Almost awkward, like I was waiting for something to happen. But after a minute the silence started settling in, not heavy, just... real. I noticed the warmth from the mug in my hands, the soft hum of the fridge, the fact that I could actually hear myself breathe. I hadn't noticed any of those things in months. Later that day I walked around my apartment without background noise for the first time in ages. No podcasts, no music, no endless chatter. I didn't expect it, but the stillness made me feel grounded in a way that shopping, cleaning, reorganizing never has. I think I forgot what my life feels like without constant input. I'm not trying to escape society or move to a cabin. I just think I want more moments like that. Little pockets of space where I'm actually present instead of running from task to task.

Hi there internet stranger !
I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :
I’m a 21 year old with ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then never listen to them again and end up hoarding them on my iPod. I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I’m up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click.

Things to expect if we become friends
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

I could have mastered the bagpipes, learned to play underwater, and almost summoned a small storm, reorganized my entire life alphabetically, by color, and by existential importance, or invented a gourmet recipe using only ketchup, ramen, and leftover dreams.

I could have trained a squad of squirrels to perform synchronized acrobatics in my backyard, completed a marathon in my mind, meditated through the finish line, or solved the meaning of life, lost it under the couch cushions, and started again. I could have become a professional-level interpretive air-guitarist while balancing on a yoga ball, organized a one-person flash mob in my living room, negotiated world peace between my houseplants, or even learned to juggle flamingos—surprisingly cooperative, by the way.

I could have started a conspiracy theory podcast that everyone listens to but no one admits, mastered extreme origami, built a castle out of coffee cups, or finally convinced my cat to reveal its life secrets. And yet, after all of that… I’m still sitting here, waiting, thinking maybe I should’ve just solved the problem myself 😅💸

He comes over for a week each year and she shows him the city, and they go to coffee together and such.

I told her how this dude is thirsty and i myself don’t deal with thirsty men because they can’t be trusted and screw it up for everyone for a whiff of validation and it’s damned uncomfortable tbh, got called a sexist and how she always chooses the guy over anything even over me. I resigned and said it’s ok then, i prefer not to hear about him.

I did hear about him, lots of times she brought him up in conversations how awesome he is, and i repeatedly expressed that i explicitly do not want to hear that name ever again. Her response ""You can’t police my language like that! You are insecure and jealous! Even my guy friend said you’re oppressive"" I ignored her, went to the gym nobody needs shaming, over a boundary.

I left with no explanation, and went lifting.

Then i reflected.

Why is it that women think they can have it all and not understand that this will cause conflict in relationships? And i realized my gf had no empathy and didn’t put herself into my shoes. She has probably never been told ""no"" that much in her life. The ""why"" doesn’t matter, she can do whatever she wants, i don’t need this in my life.

GF came over and said this guy friend will be here and visit our city for a week, she’ll have a coffee with him. She tried to seduce me and I avoided her thouch. She cried and couldn’t understand what was wrong.

Deep down i cringed the hell out.

I could not see her in a romantic way anymore. It’s like having a complete stranger in your apartment all the memories just vanished. Over the years there was so much drama surrounding this guy, i went completely numb.

She’s still crying, and can’t calm down anymore, i didn’t cared i haven’t asked for this. Told her she needs to go, i blocked her nr. never talked to her again. She’s free to do whatever she wants, i don’t have to have this shit in my life.",40,1763205289.0,self,44,0.81,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Texas A&M vs. South Carolina: A Lopsided Lone Star Showdown**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a football equivalent of a Marvel villain facing a coffee-powered toddler: **Texas A&M (9-0)** is about to host the **South Carolina Gamecocks (3-6)** on November 15, 2025, and the Aggies are so favored, the odds make it look like a math test. Let’s break this down with the precision of a SEC officiating crew and the humor of a coach whose playcaller just spelled “Hail Mary” as “Hail Mere.”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Foregone Conclusion

The moneyline tells a story of unflinching confidence: **Texas A&M is -1200**, meaning bettors need to risk $1,200 to win a measly $100 on the Aggies. Conversely, **South Carolina is +750**, implying a $100 bet on the Gamecocks would net you $750 *if* they somehow pull off the impossible. (Spoiler: They won’t. Keep scrolling.)

The spread is equally lopsided, with A&M favored by **17.5–18 points** across bookmakers. For context, that’s like betting on a cheetah to beat a snail in a 100-meter dash… and then *also* betting on the cheetah to finish before the snail’s breakfast digests. The over/under of **49.5 points** is tantalizing, too, especially since A&M’s offense averages 37.8 PPG (12th in FBS) and South Carolina’s defense allows 34.2 PPG (112th). This isn’t a game—it’s a points bonanza with a side of mercy rule.

---

### Team News: Aggies Bring the Hammer, Gamecocks Bring the “W”… Wait, No

**Texas A&M** is riding a wave of dominance. Their defense is a sack-happy juggernaut, leading the nation with **34 sacks** this season. Opposing quarterbacks? They’re treated like piñatas at a SEC party. The Aggies’ rushing attack (204.9 YPG) is about to collide with South Carolina’s **third-worst run defense**, which is so porous, it makes a colander look like a vault.

On the other side of the ball, **South Carolina** is a team in freefall. They’ve lost six of their last seven games, including a 30-14 drubbing by Ole Miss, and their star quarterback, **LaNorris Sellers**, is a dual-threat marvel… if you ignore the f

1oxoxp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step3/comments/1oxoxp1/finally_free_my_unofficial_step_3_qbank_review_ps/,FINALLY FREE! My Unofficial Step 3 QBank Review 🚀 (P.S. I FAILED THE FIRST TIME),"I'm officially on the other side, and honestly, the sheer relief is incredible. If you're an intern studying for this beast, first off, **I salute you**. Trying to cram pediatrics management between a 28-hour shift and getting three hours of sleep truly sucks. This whole ""take Step 3 during intern year"" thing is a genuine form of institutionalized cruelty. Your brain is soup, you're constantly running on adrenaline and cold coffee, and then you have to dedicate precious *weekend* time to studying for a two-day exam that mostly just gets you your independent license. Rant over, but seriously, it was brutal.

But for me, it was twice as brutal. I have to be completely honest: I failed my first attempt at Step 3. It was demoralizing, embarrassing, and truly soul-crushing to get that email, especially after being so mentally and physically exhausted from intern year. I had done the ""right"" thing: I finished UWorld, took the recommended practice tests, and still fell short.

When I signed up for the retake, I knew I definitely couldn't afford to fail again. A friend who passed on her first try kept nagging me to try a newer resource, and I finally caved.

Here are my genuine, no-holds-barred thoughts on **UWorld** (for my first attempt) versus **SmashTheBoards (STB)** (which saved me for the retake):

1. [UWorld.com](http://UWorld.com) (The Tried-and-True... But Not for Me)

**My First Attempt Experience:** I did 100% of the QBank. I’ve used UWorld for Step 1 and Step 2, so I trusted it implicitly.

**Why I Think It Failed Me:**

**Too Focused on Diagnoses:** UWorld is phenomenal for *diagnosing* a patient. But Step 3 often tests the *management* of common/chronic conditions and the next best step in outpatient care, which UWorld's questions didn't always reflect.

**Day 1 Disconnect:** I felt completely unprepared for the Day 1 Biostats and Ethics questions. UWorld's explanations are clear, but the actual questions weren't nuanced enough compared to the real deal. I walked out of Day 1 feeling awful, and that feeling translated directly into my failed score.

**The Cost:** After failing, having to pay for the subscription again just added insult to injury.

2. [SmashTheBoards.com](http://SmashTheBoards.com) (STB) - The Savior 🚀

**My Retake Experience:** I decided to ditch UWorld and commit fully to this new resource that my friend swore by.

**The Good (The Reason I Passed):**

* **THE QUESTIONS! (Closest to the Real Deal):** The questions on STB were uncannily similar to the actual Step 3 exam. Not just in content, but in *style* and *vibe*. They had that specific vague, ""what's the next most appropriate step in management for a condition you haven't seen since M2"" feel that the real exam loves. This was the key difference between passing and failing. It specifically prepped me for the clinical judgment that UWorld had missed.
* **Anki Flashcard Integration:** This was a total game-changer for an exhausted resident who was already demoralized. For every question I got wrong, STB generated a downloadable Anki flashcard with the concise fact. No more manual card making! It maximized my study time and focused my review entirely on my weaknesses.
* **Price:** This QBank was significantly cheaper than UWorld. Seriously, after shelling out $500 for the first attempt and the retake fees, the low cost of STB $99 for 6 months was a massive relief.
* **Gamification:** This sounds stupid, but the little details helped. When you get a question right, you get a celebratory burst of confetti 🎉. When you get one wrong, a funny meme pops up. It broke the monotony and actually made me look forward to doing questions, which is a miracle for a retake study period.

1. AMBOSS (A quick note)

*I had started to dabble in AMBOSS to shore up my Biostats, but honestly, once I found STB, I realized that the combination of STB's representative questions and its excellent Anki integration was a better use of my limited time than digging through AMBOSS's super-detailed articles.*

🏆 The Final Verdict for Step 3 Prep & Beyond 🏆

I'm only one person, but I have the data of two attempts. The standard advice is UWorld, UWorld, UWorld. But for Step 3, I think that advice is outdated, and my failure proved it. UWorld's style is no longer representative enough of the actual test questions.

My honest opinion is that SmashTheBoards was the best and most crucial resource for my PASS.

It was the cheapest, the questions were the most accurate, and the flashcards automation literally saved me dozens of hours of repetitive work. If you're an intern studying for this beast and feeling overwhelmed, or especially if you're facing a retake, please give STB a try. It specifically trains you for the unique flavor of the Step 3 exam.

The IM Boards & ITE Plan

Given how spot-on STB was for the complex, judgment-based clinical questions on Step 3—which, let's face it, is a lot of IM—I'm not stopping now.

* **For the ABIM Certification Exam (Internal Medicine Boards):** I'm planning to use STB as my core question bank alongside MKSAP. I know MKSAP is the gold standard for the Boards, but I'll use it to fill in the gaps and get my percentage up. My focus on STB will be for the sheer efficiency of the **Anki card creation** for every question I miss. The ABIM is massive, and having an automatically generated, customized Anki deck that perfectly tracks my weakest areas (Cardio, Pulm, looking at you!) is going to be non-negotiable for PGY-3 year.
* **For the Internal Medicine In-Training Exam (ITE):** The ITE is essentially a high-stakes predictor for the ABIM Boards. Starting with PGY-2, I'm going to start running STB questions on an *untimed* tutor mode for focused, daily learning. The goal isn't just to score well on the ITE, but to use STB's concise explanations and immediate spaced repetition (via those wonderful Anki cards) to build a solid, long-term knowledge base. I'll use the ITE reports to then fine-tune my STB blocks to the weakest subjects.

I am done trusting the old guard for my major exams. I'm sticking with what got me my Step 3 pass.

Good luck to everyone studying. The relief of passing after a retake is truly something special. Now, back to my post-call nap.",11,1763204420.0,Step3,0,0.87,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Bologna vs. Udinese: A Serie A Showdown Where the Odds Are as Clear as a Barista’s Espresso**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Bologna is the favorite here, and the bookmakers aren’t just throwing darts at a board. Across all platforms, Bologna’s implied probability of winning ranges from **47% to 51%** (thanks to decimal odds as low as 1.97 on BetRivers), while Udinese clings to a **26-29%** chance (with +380 odds, because apparently their attack moves as fast as a tourist in Florence). The draw? A tidy 30-33%, which is about the same chance as your local barista remembering your coffee order without you spelling it out.

The spread lines also tell a story. Bologna is favored by **-0.25 goals**, meaning they’re the “favorite by a nose” (or a penalty kick). Udinese, meanwhile, is +0.25 with higher odds, which is as comforting as a 30-year-old claiming they’re “ageless” on a dating app.

**Digest the News: Recent Form Is a Feast for Bologna**  
Bologna has been a well-oiled machine lately. They’ve strung together wins over Como (1-0) and Parma (3-1), including a **1st-minute goal** from Bernabé that’s the football equivalent of “scoring before your opponent realizes the game started.” Their defense? Tighter than a Neapolitan’s grip on their *sfogliatella*. In their last three matches, they’ve conceded just one goal—proof that their backline is a vault, not a vulnerability.

Udinese, meanwhile, has been… *adventurous*. Their 1-0 loss to AC Milan last month was a masterclass in “almost, but not quite.” They’ve managed t

Me (32M), on the other side, I am more like a casual PokemonGo player. - I am just connecting once in a while, catching some Pokemon, getting into some raids and whenever I am in another city or country (I travel a lot for work) I always try to find a nice postcard to send to him or catch some local Pokemon.

Catching and filling shinny ones is the new game objective for him. We usually meet for a coffee or lunch, exchange Pokemon (I usually give him all my shinnies), talk about them, check the details (Check the Annihilape description)... Having been distant in the past, this game has taken us back to the times in the 90s when we were gaming together and has given a nice excuse to meet more often and go for Pokemon walks.

I was thinking that would be great to have a shared Pokedex so we could start together a blank Pokedex, capture Pokemon, have a common objective and share the progress day by day. I visualize it as the group challenges, but indicating who captured which Pokemon and how much different Pokemon has each one catched. It would give a new objective for people usually playing together and, in my case, would be another excuse to keep having Pokemon days with my dad.

The smell is almost like a fruity coffee cake- the soft buttery/cream aspect of it is 🤤 I will be doing a personal test using ONLY the cuddle balm as my lip moisturizer for the coming week and will report back 🫡 
ALSO the jelly tip is to die for

are yall interested in the results? 
Day one has been ✨ magic ✨ 

Sincerely- a dude who owns every glossier balm and dedicates way too much space and money to makeup for not trying to be an influencer. (BUT I don’t use/own a lot of the other balms on the market)

Also - the eyeliner w micellar water feels revolutionary. I’m curious to take the mechanism apart 👀 and I’m curious how long the felt tip on the liner will last.

Nililenga the call but he calls two more times before stopping. So, it's been years since I've communicated with this guy and honestly I forgot about him but for a minute after that call I remembered.

Mr M was that guy who was at his peak. I'm talking about cars, money, connections to the business and political world, frequent business trips overseas and he was infact in a top leadership role of a prestigious university huku Kenya.

Dude gave me the world eeh!! Yani ushai kaa hivi and you're getting random gift deliveries, mpesa messages, words of affirmation through texts or calls, and also career/ educational advise? He'd ask me about my studies, side hustle, and tell me what's hot in the job market, what I can do to elevate and ask where I'd like to work aone kama akona connections, ananiambia niapply passport because of how I'd never been outside country and he'd like to give me that... He'd talk of how he appreciated the peace I gave him, my innovative mind, independence stance and how he'd found a friend in me. He was so open to me that he used to tell me a lot of stories and secrets

Anyways my mum found out about him. Apparently spotted us in public one day and she instantly recognized him from some pictures she'd seen on Google. Sat me down, talked with me and advised me on the prons and cons of being with him. Mostly cons...

After that, I ignored the guy. It was hard, he kept calling, texting etc but I managed and here I am years later glad I did because what if ningekuwa another Regina Daniels? (Yes, Kuna possibility maybe ingekuwa different but still..)

The guy probably saw me because that was a place he to go for outdoor business. Anyways big up to my lovely mum🌹

1oxojz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1oxojz4/a_complete_guide_to_the_hidden_interactions_of/,A complete guide to the hidden interactions of L2D Skins I personally own.,"After discovering that the in-game shop only displays hidden interactions for L2D skins you already own, I decided to fully catalogue every hidden interaction I could find. This involved a combination of thorough testing (tapping every possible spot on every skin) and scouring Reddit and community posts for confirmation. Though I may have missed some interactions.

I’ve documented **21 skins so far**, but I plan to expand this list.\] with your help.  
If you know any additional interactions or know of interactions for characters not listed, or notice something I’ve missed, please leave them in the comments, I’ll update this post and eventually make a Part 2 once the list grows large enough.

I originally created this collection for myself so I could always remember how to properly use my skins, especially the more interactive ones. For example, I didn’t even realise that **Laffey II’s bunny skin** had multiple hidden interactions, despite her being my favourite Azur Lane character. It was extremely obvious in hindsight, so yes, I feel a bit silly for missing it.

It’s also possible I skipped some skins I own, and I’m unsure whether any of the “animated but non-L2D” skins contain hidden interactions, so there may still be omissions.

I’ve tried to keep this list **safe-for-work in phrasing**, so it doesn’t require an NSFW tag.  
With all that said, here is the list.

That’s the sin. I was “on fire” I guess.

So why am I replaying the ONE weird moment I had all day, which in turn is opening the floodgates of doubt making me think I wasn’t confident and capable today, I was annoying and bossy and everyone could tell how stupid I am. 

It wasn’t even that weird, I was halfway through my morning coffee on an empty stomach (I know I know), having a quick chat with my boss who laughs and jokes with me all the time probably to a slightly unprofessional level, when he was struggling to find the x to close a window on zoom.

\- Turn off all components except for utilities at the computer when installing the upgrades or else it'll explode, use a wrench when removing the bolted in plates.

\- When using cement use it until the bucket is empty or else it'll dry up, water will NOT fix it.

\- Write down the satellite names on a paper sheet in case you forget which one you're collecting data from.

\- You don't need to clean all of the bathroom components to get the achievement just one of each.

\- Be more focused on adding coolers on the miner before going crazy on the GPUs, it'll explode and you'll lose the upgrades.

\- The buttons on the coordinates panel can be used, the ones on the left lock onto each selected dot while the ones on the right call for them.

\- You can store stuff in the crafting table now 

\- If you can't pick up your ATV to move it DO NOT DRIVE IT! Just repeatedly try grabbing it or pull it with the hook until it finally moves, if you don't you'll fly up in the sky at a random area of the map or just get tossed in general.

\- Cubicle frames can be separated by repeatedly hitting it. Sadly I have no idea so far how to connect back together or how to locked them in place on the ground.

\- The sauce can burn stuff 

\- When you collect the money stack from \[REDACTED\] you can separate them on the crafting table and put them into the atm to get the points.

\- Use gravity when driving down hill or normal levelled ground when driving the ATV to save on battery and fuel.

\- The coffee machine uses points instead of money.

\- You can add the soap bar to the water bucket to add a cleaning buff and I personally prefer using the mop as it last longer when cleaning in general.

\- Fixing servers still gives you points and bonus points if you beat the recorded time.

1oxogz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oxogz7/my_bosom_friend/,My Bosom Friend.,"I had a boyfriend in high school who was my absolute best friend ever. I thought he was THE coolest person ever (he kind of was), and I was actually in love with him long before he asked me to be his girlfriend. We would stay up late and talk and laugh about literally everything, and shared so many hobbies and opinions…I never thought we wouldn’t stay together.

Before I went nearly 12 hours away to college, the only world I had known was my own small town. Because I wanted to go a specific school out-of-state, I knew it would be tough on our relationship, but I felt a strong pull toward something bigger than myself. From the moment I arrived on campus I was slapped with the realization that 1) I was in a whole new world and 2) my life experiences had been really limited up to that point. I got extremely excited to be around so many new people and had no desire to go back to living I’m such a small scale world. I broke up with my boyfriend within a few weeks and didn’t think of him much for the rest of my college tenure.

Three weeks after college graduation, I married my college boyfriend. We were together for only 1.5 years, but we were having amazing sex and hated living with our roommates, so it seemed right. I remember thinking of my ex during my engagement, wondering how he would feel (clearly he still felt close to my heart), but i was caught up in the future I thought I was building.

Fast forward to our 1-year anniversary and the first year of marriage was so tough. My husband was consuming pornography regularly and neglecting the shaky foundation our relationship was built on (physical touch). I was so lonely and homesick. I reached out to my ex on reddit.

My ex and I ended up having a long distance “affair” for the better part of a year (we never had sex, but we met up on several occasions and things would get heated). In one year, we had more amazing memories than some couples have in a lifetime. He made me SO happy. I genuinely contemplated leaving my husband, but as a religious person, I kept hearing things/seeing signs that I was going to be making a big mistake. After a months-long struggle with pretty severe anxiety over the affair, I ended things with my ex and my anxiety evaporated. Life moved on. I never reached out again—the psychological burden that secrecy brings was enough to keep me from ever sending a text again. That was eight years ago.

Now, I have two kids, several rewarding careers on my resume, and my husband and I have traveled and lived in four different states (once we lived only minutes from my ex, but I still never reached out again). We just moved into the CUTEST historical home only a few hours from my hometown, and yesterday I spent the day crafting with a bunch of ladies from my church. I’m finding peace for the first time in nearly four years (we moved across the country in the midst of a pregnancy and then i got hit with pretty severe PPD) and my husband and I work really hard to make our marriage healthy for our kids...

That’s why these dreams are SO destructive. Vivid dreams about my ex, and the life we might’ve lived. Dreams about what he’s doing now, and his indifference toward me. Dreams where we stayed friends and drifted apart naturally. Last night I dreamt that we were dating but he kept forgetting about me for years at a time. 

At the end of the day, he was my best friend and an extension of my childhood and my home, and I grieve his “death” often. I tried to bring him up in therapy once, but my counselor didn’t seem to grasp the full impact that he had had on my life. He inspired my love of the outdoors, my formative years working at summer camps, my bend toward “Midwest melancholy” type music, my hatred of unnecessary abbreviations, my love/hate relationship with keeping journals, my appreciation for good coffee, etc. I often fight the urge to listen to “our” playlist, and will have to play uplifting music instead or I’ll get caught in a depressed funk. It doesn’t feel normal to spend the rest of my life being haunted by a ex, but here we are. 

I wish we could just…catch up over coffee. I’d give anything to hear his voice again. I’ve often thought how easy it would be to reach out and say hello, but no  line of communication would be appropriate anymore. Even though in reality we are probably unrecognizable to each other, in my mind we’ll always be 23 and super cool. But in the off-chance you see this, I hope you are doing well. I hope you are living the life you deserve. I hope you are so so happy. I’m sorry that I’ve never fully forgotten you… I’m kind of lame in that way. I hope our paths cross someday, but even if they don’t, I know I’ll see you again.

1oxoglh,https://i.redd.it/0fmgd50see1g1.png,Anyone else scrambling for last-minute Christmas preparations? I found a pretty good Christmas tree,"so i’ve been casually browsing [aliexpress.us](http://aliexpress.us) lately trying to find stuff that doesn’t take a month to ship... and surprisingly they actually have some decent stuff now, especially if you're into last-minute holiday shopping or just want something cheap but not trash-tier.  
  
i stumbled across a few things worth checking out – mostly homey vibes and random gift ideas. everything ships from their us warehouse so delivery was way faster than i expected (like 4–6 days).  
  
also randomly grabbed some working discount codes bc why not share lol  
  
heres what i saw / bought:  
  
“led string lights with remote and timer” – set of 3 strands, color changing, good for dorms or balconies  
  
“portable mini projector with hd resolution” – looks sketchy but works fine for movie nights lol  
  
“heated blanket with 3 heat settings” – winter essential tbh, soft too  
  
“vintage style coffee maker glass carafe” – aesthetic + functional  
  
and here’s how the discounts work at checkout (pretty standard tiered system):  
  
Spend 10, Save 2 (20%) → Code: ZXC2U  
  
Spend 25, Save 5 (20%) → Code: ZXC5U  
  
Spend 35, Save 7 (20%) → Code: ZXC7U  
  
Spend 50, Save 10 (20%) → Code: ZXC10U  
  
Spend 70, Save 14 (20%) → Code: ZXC14U  
  
Spend 100, Save 20 (20%) → Code: ZXC20U  
  
Spend 125, Save 25 (20%) → Code: ZXC25U  
  
Spend 160, Save 32 (20%) → Code: ZXC32S  
  
Spend 280, Save 56 (20%) → Code: ZXC56S  
  
Spend 320, Save 64 (20%) → Code: ZXC64S  
  
Spend 400, Save 80 (20%) → Code: ZXC80S  
  
Spend 500, Save 100 (20%) → Code: ZXC100S  
  
Spend 599, Save 120 (20%) → Code: ZXC120P  
  
tip: look for the tiny ""apply discount"" box during checkout — easy to miss and super annoying when you forget 😅  
  
not sponsored or whatever, just thought id throw it out there since people seem to still be scrambling for affordable finds this close to christmas. hope someone finds this useful!

1oxofny,https://i.redd.it/kijnml8iee1g1.jpeg,"6,7 kg winter haul","Hey repfam, just got a shipment in and thought I'd drop a quick review of the quality on these pieces 'cause I'm actually shocked at how good everything is. My wallet is crying but my closet is thanking me, you know how it goes.



Dior blue down jacket

Man, this jacket is legit, the reversible design is fire and it feels super puffy and warm, perfect for the coming cold. The full monogram print on the other side is actually really subtle, not too flashy which I appreciate about the quality and material.



Stone Island jacket

The metallic nylon finish on this Stone Island puffer is just stunning in person; it catches the light so well and feels heavy-duty. It's properly thick and plush—gonna keep me toasty without lookin like a giant marshmallow, definitely a good score.



SAINT MICHAEL Hoodie

If you like graphic tees, this hoodie is a must-have—the vintage American style and all-over graffiti print is crazy good. The detail on the 'Simpson/Madonna' design is crisp and the distressed fabric feels spot on like a genuinely old, worn-in favorite.



Thom hoodie

I picked up the zip-up version and the quality is definitely ""high version"" as advertised; the stitching on the signature four-bar stripe is totally flawless. It's a great weight for layering, you could wear it spring or fall easy, and sizing felt right.



Oakley sweatshirt

Really happy with this basic crewneck, the embroidery quality is top-notch and super clean—no loose threads or nothing. It's got that nice loose, casual fit, which is ideal for just lounging or grabbing coffee.



Canada goose vest

Don't sleep on this vest, it's way thicker than I expected and the ""export quality"" tag seems right because the construction is super solid. It's all about that warmth without the bulk, gonna be my new go-to for chilly mornings.



Stussy Beanie

Needed a solid beanie for winter, and this one fits my big head perfectly, which is always a struggle, lol. The knit is really tight and soft, plus the simple logo makes it easy to rock with anything.



Dior Scarf

Wow, this scarf feels really luxurious, the wool/cashmere blend is seriously soft and the double-sided print is a nice touch for versatility. The subtle ""D"" logo and tassels make it look high-end, and it's definitely big enough to wear like a proper shawl or wrap.

1oxofju,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1oxofju/anyone_else_hate_the_hacking_minigame/,Anyone else hate the hacking mini-game?,"Just finished the game, and as much as I loved everything else about it, one thing I absolutely HATED was the hacking mini-game.

Like, it wasn't bad at first.  Fun little puzzle to demonstrate Robert's smarts and how he's not ENTIRELY useless outside of the suit.  But things took a HARD turn when anti-virus programs got introduced, and suddenly this neat little puzzle game turned into a high stakes game of Pacman where you have to stop and type a ten-key password in the five seconds you have until the angry red ball gets you.

It got so bad that, in the final episode, I had to go into settings and turn on Unlimited Hacking Attempts just to get through it.  And when I did, I realized just how MUCH I would've had to do, under a time limit, with only four attempts, and it frankly just seems unfair.

In Adhoc's defense though, my PC *is* a potato from the far-off year of 2015.  Dispatch is thankfully *not* a graphically demanding game, but even so, my poor potato still couldn't run the game at its ideal frame-rate, which does NOT mix well with the second-delay in the hacking mini-game, which I'm told is SUPPOSED to be there.

Worst part is, without spoiling anything, I did NOT get a good ending, and I strongly suspect my numerous hacking failures were to blame.  It honestly left a bad taste in my mouth, like the game was punishing me for having a bad frame-rate.  I thought I made all the right choices, but apparently, the most important choice of all was whether or not to buy a better graphics card.

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm the only one who feels that the hacking mini-game is an ugly coffee stain on what is otherwise a masterpiece of interactive storytelling.",4,1763202570.0,DispatchAdHoc,2,0.83,False

1oxodo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MIDIcontrollers/comments/1oxodo1/pianomotion_give_life_back_to_selfplaying_piano/,PianoMotion - Give Life Back To Self-Playing Piano,"Bonjour! I’m a piano and tech enthusiast, and I just finished developing \*\*PianoMotion\*\* a bluetooth midi player for self playing piano, an Android app (totally free and free of ads!) that lets you play \*\*any piano MIDI file wirelessly via Bluetooth\*\* on your acoustic player piano (Yamaha Disklavier, Steinway Spirio, Bösendorfer CEUS, PianoDisc, QRS, …) no more need of DKC-900 or DKC-850...

📥 \*\*Download the APK here:\*\*https://github.com/KevinChopin/PianoMotion

IMPORTANT: The app is not currently on the Play Store. Installation must be done manually: download the APK from my GitHub repository and then run the file. It is essential that you have enabled the permission to 'Install unknown apps' in your device settings beforehand.

How it works:

1. Plug a \*\*Bluetooth MIDI adapter\*\* (Yamaha MD-BT01, CME WIDI Master, or any compatible model) into your piano’s MIDI ports.
2. Connect your phone via Bluetooth.
3. Load any piano MIDI file.
4. Press \*\*play\*\* – watch your piano perform!

\*\*Why I made it:\*\*

There are very few accessible apps that truly unlock the magic of these instruments. I wanted to create something \*\*simple, free, and ad-free\*\*, so anyone could enjoy their piano, no matter its age.

I built \*\*PianoMotion\*\* because it was frustrating to see manufacturers either \*\*offer only poor-quality apps\*\* for their pianos or \*\*abandon older instruments entirely\*\*, pushing you to buy a new one without proper software support. With PianoMotion, you can \*\*play your favorite MIDI tracks, record your own performances, revive old Disklavier floppy disks\*\*, (and soon even \*\*sing along while your piano plays the backing\*\*!). NB: App is currently in French but English version is coming soon.

Features:

\* 🎵 Play MIDI files wirelessly via Bluetooth
\* 🎹 Record and replay your own performances, record your old PianoSoft Plus or other floppy disks, as well as the songs stored in your controller’s memory.
\* 🔜 Soon: “Voice + MIDI” mode – sing while your piano plays + Spotify or Deezer auto convert stream to midi.
Also i'll integrate directly in apps some midi files and Yamaha E-competitions files.
\* 💖 Completely free and ad-free

\*\*Try it & Give Feedback\*\*

I’d love for everyone to try PianoMotion. Your bug reports, suggestions, and feature ideas are what will help make this app better and more enjoyable for the piano community.

If you want to see the disklavier in action : \[Alicia (Clair Obscur Expedition 33) on Yamaha Disklavier - PianoMotion App Demo\](https://youtu.be/GSs-DGnv-rc)

Thanks for reading, and let’s make our pianos sing again!
