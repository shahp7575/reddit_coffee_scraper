They gave me a welcome letter and explained all my benefits, $100 hotel credit, $110 breakfast credit for two. They also let me check in at 11:30AM, which was very nice. They upgraded my room from a street facing one to an ocean facing one, which was also very nice.

The $110 breakfast credit made a lot more sense when I saw the prices, but it absolutely covered breakfast for two with coffee, so that was nice. Overall great experience that was significantly enhanced by the FHR program.",1,1766182423.0,AmexPlatinum,0,1.0,False

I've been playing around with Web SDR listening on & off a bit for about a decade. I have did it on my phone in coffee shops, etc using my bluetooth headphones, but I really would like a dedicated device I can take out with me that has knob controls I could map the tuner to. Does such a thing exist or am I dreaming?? I do remember seeing a dial control one could buy to map the tuner to & I guess worst case scenario I could take that out with me & use a tablet. Even at home, the tactile feel of turning a dial would make the experience alot more enjoyable to me

Eventually one day I will get a regular SW radio, although what's been holding me back is my fear I won't be able to pick up much interesting.

1pqxx2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pqxx2o/pork_intolerance/,pork intolerance,"Hi I'm a hispanic 21f, 5ft2 140ish pounds living in the US. This is really long so bear with me please.

About 3 years ago, I ate Pernil (slow-roasted pork leg) on New Years and I was sick for about 3-4 days after. I kind of assumed it had something to do with the way it was prepared or the fact that it was sitting on the counter for a couple of hours before being reheated and served. That bout of sickness started the next day around 8ish hours after eating and it began with extreme bloating, nausea and intense sulfur burps to the point where no one could stand to be around me. I finally threw up about 2 days after eating the pork and it was black vomit with the worst smell you could ever imagine, worse than a normal vomit smell. It was as if the food I had eaten had been sitting and rotting in my stomach. I tend to vomit a lot from just stomach bugs and hangovers but this was completely different than that. The burps finally stopped after 4ish days and I just continued my life as normal thinking it was just a one off.

Later that year (6 months later) I was in Colombia and I ate Chicharron (deep fried pork skin/fat) from a hotel breakfast buffet and again I was sick for about 3 days, with similar symptoms as the first time. I tried to treat both times with antacids, famotidine, omeprazole, probiotics and any stomach pill I had on hand. Nothing works until whatever is in my system makes its way out completely.

I think those were the only 2 incidents I had in 2023, with maybe having had other small reactions that year but it wasn't as extreme or debilitating as the other 2 were, they might have been either only diarrhea/vomiting or only bloating for example. Both of those times were bad enough to make me be more cautious with how long my food had been sitting, and being extra cautious with pork but not avoiding it completely.

In 2024 I visited Colombia again, and this time I avoided eating pork completely and I still got sick. My family hired a local lady to cook for us for the day and I was with my aunt and her kids who asked the lady to make bacon for breakfast. I got to breakfast after everything was already cooked so I didn't see anything being prepared. My breakfast was a fried sweet arepa that doesn't have any sort of meat in it and I didn't touch the bacon at all. A couple of hours later right before lunch, I started to feel nauseous so I skipped lunch and ate watermelon instead. Then I felt even worse and at this point I thought that I must have accidentally ingested some pork since I started burping sulfur. I ended up trying to force myself to vomit digitally which didn't work. My grandma gave me sodium bicarb dissolved in water to try to help the nausea but she might have accidentally put too much because I drank it and I immediately threw everything up. That definitely helped because I wasn't sick for as long with the vomiting and diarrhea lasting only a day ish and the sulfur burps for a while longer. Later on, I thought about everything I had eaten 12-24 hours before I got sick and figured it was probably cross contamination from the bacon grease and whatever oil was used to fry my arepa. I didn't know at the time but it was probably also worsened by the watermelon.

At that point, I figured I probably just should avoid eating pork as much as possible. Again, I still ate it sometimes because I do really like pork (the same way lactose intolerant people will sometimes eat ice cream). So I decided to stick to deli meats (ham, pepperoni, prosciutto) only since I figured they weren't really cooked but cured. The only cooked pork I had that year I think was probably around the holidays since it's hard to avoid pork during the holiday season. Nothing that I can remember gave me the same reaction that I had before.

I know that this isn't normal food poisoning because whoever I'm with will also eat the same food as me and I'm the only one who ever gets sick. I also got sick that same year in Scotland from eating fish and chips. My dad and I shared that plate and we both got sick with the worst food poisoning we had probably ever had (ex. projectile vomiting so severe I could feel my entire abdomen clenching up from the force). This sickness was horrible but it still wasn't as bad as what I felt like those 3 other times after eating pork.

I only got sick one other time in December, not from pork and without the same symptoms, that I'm bringing up because there's a condition that has a sensitivity to all red meats (Alpha-gal syndrome). I went to a friends grad party at night and I had eaten ground meat for dinner the night before (over 24 hours before) and that night during the party I felt nauseous, so I made myself throw up and I threw up the ground beef I had eaten like 30 hours earlier, whole and undigested. I freaked out and thought I had gastroparesis but I don't think I've had anything like that since so it probably isn't that. Since then, I have gotten really bloated and gassy, sometimes even diarrhea from ground meats, both beef and turkey, and steak sometimes gives me the same effect but not every time. 

From then I don't think I had any other reactions, but I might be forgetting stuff. I was still cautious with what I ate but after maybe 8ish months with no reactions I got lulled into a false sense of security and I started eating pork again. Not as much as I used to but at home once in a blue moon or if it was something I really loved or a bite or 2 from a plate that had bacon in it. It seems really dumb to me in hindsight but my thinking at the time was that I didn't want to alter my whole diet forever because I had 3 really bad reactions to pork and it didn't happen every single time I ate pork. I slowly started introducing some pork back into my diet over the beginning of this year, focusing mainly on things that weren't extremely fatty/greasy and bit by bit.

In August 2025, I went to the Dominican Republic and stayed at an all inclusive. One of the nights we went to the Brazilian restaurant, where they bring you the meat on skewers and slice it onto your plate. I avoided the skewers of pork completely and stuck to only eating meat and chicken, but I wasn't really thinking about the sausage that was most definitely pork. I ate maybe a quarter of it or so, since I didn't really like it. I went to sleep that night and felt a little gassy and bloated. I passed gas a couple of times and it smelt so bad that it woke my sister up. At some point in the night, I woke up and felt like I needed to fart again but I decided to be a good sister and go to the bathroom. I proceeded to have 3 hours straight of simultaneous watery diarrhea and vomiting. I had to call my mom to come in from the room next door and hold me up because I was actively fainting but couldn't get off the toilet or let go of the trash can. I was again burping up sulfur. She basically held me up until everything was out of my system. This was possibly the most extreme I got sick to the point I thought I might have to go to the hospital.

We woke up kinda early the next day to go to this waterfall in the middle of the jungle that you had to hike to. That morning since it was early and I didn't have that much of an appetite, I probably had mainly fruit (mango, granadilla, and watermelon) that morning. It's also important to note that I woke up feeling better, with no sulfur burps so I assumed that I had gotten all the pork I ate out of my system.

I'm not sure if this is important to the pork thing but this might be a pre-existing medical condition/symptom but this can be skipped. The week before we left, I had gone to study at a local coffee shop and I walked there, like a mile away. I got to the shop and immediately started feeling faint and I passed out completely for maybe a minute or so. I was wearing my apple watch so I could see that my heart rate increased to the 180s and dropped to the 60s. I'm prone to fainting and vasovagal syncopes but I've never passed out completely before that.

That day at the waterfall everything was fine until about 1 pm when we started to hike back up. I'm also deathly afraid of heights so by the time we made it back up again, I'm not sure if it was a combo of fear, low stamina, and whatever heart problem had happened to me the week before, but I started to faint again. This time I didn't faint completely but I had to sit for a while. We went back to the hotel and grabbed lunch and as I'm walking around the buffet line I feel faint again. I check my watch and my heart rate won't go down from 160-150 even after I sat down for about 20 minutes. I try to drink salted water for electrolytes and more watermelon thinking I'm probably dehydrated. I start to feel nauseous and burp sulfur again, so I go to the bathroom and projectile vomit water and watermelon. I almost faint again and dry heave until I can't anymore.

I take it easy later that day and stick to plain rice and chicken. I start to feel better after sleeping the whole day and not eating anything. I also hadn't burped at all a couple of hours after throwing up. I then decided to eat a slice of pepperoni pizza for dinner, because I'm an idiot and because pepperoni had never affected me before, with a large side of watermelon.

Once again I got sick that night with the exact same symptoms, just less extreme. I later looked it up and watermelon increases sulfur content in the stomach so maybe my body was weak from the night before and a small amount of pepperoni that wouldn't normally affect me did and it was made worse by all the watermelon I had been eating all day.

From that point I've been too scared to eat any pork at all including deli meats, as well as watermelon in case I ate something contaminated and that makes it worse. I've been avoiding everything that has ever even touched pork briefly since I was lowkey traumatized from that. 

Now why I'm asking about this now. I just came back from a trip to Colombia a couple of days ago where I got sick again but this time I've been avoiding pork for months without any incidents of contamination either. I went to the mall and had a burger there. My sister and my dad both got bacon burgers from the same place and neither of them got sick. This is the part that's different from every other time I've gotten sick; I took maybe 2 bites of my burger and started to feel nauseous immediately. Normally, if I got contaminated it takes between 2-12 hours to start to feel the effects, but I felt bad immediately, as if it was food poisoning. I then started thinking that although my burger didn't have bacon on it, it was probably cooked where bacon had been or even with it. My stomach started to hurt worse so, not thinking I was sick already, I went to the bathroom and had diarrhea. Most of my family had already been having diarrhea just because our bodies aren't used to the water there so I assumed it was that, plus a mixture of anxiety because of the burger. I'm still sitting there when I feel the urge to vomit. I text my family and proceed to projectile vomit everything I had eaten that day. Again assuming it's food poisoning, it's not until we're trying to leave and I have to stop to dry heave again that I burp and it smells like eggs. We had to visit family all day after so I threw up again after getting to their house, took an anti-nausea pill and fell asleep in someone's room. I'm still bloated the rest of the day but after that last bout of vomiting I don't think I burped sulfur the rest of the day. I think the fact that I hadn't really digested any of the food before I threw it up, made this time only last about a day.

Nobody else in my family has any sort of pork allergy or intolerance. I've seen that there are 2 options for what I could have but neither really fits, Pork-cat syndrome and Alpha-gal syndrome. I recently developed/found out I have a cat allergy about 2ish years ago, but from what I understand the reaction from pork would be more similar to a normal allergic reaction with hives and anaphylaxis etc. I also don't think I was bitten by a tick over 3 years ago (i feel like i would know right?), and even though I get some indigestion with other red meat it's never as bad.

Please help me figure this out as I don't really want this to be permanent. Also the sulfur burps kill me as I hate eggs with a passion and I don't want to deal with those burps for the rest of my life. If this is something I have to learn to live with I want to learn what exactly it is and what can make it better or worse if I do eat something contaminated with pork, and if I have to avoid other foods that don't necessarily have pork but are made out of pork products like gelatin. Thanks and I appreciate any help or advice, especially on how to decrease sulfur burps if it ever happens again.

  
TLDR: 3 years of gi reactions and sulfur burps after eating pork, lately increasing in intensity, severity and now consistently every time I eat something that touched pork.

Date: Late September 2025

Destinations: Miami - Key West - Bimini

Room Type: Sea View (lock it in rate)

  
My husband and I (30's) went on our first VV cruise this September and overall had a great experience! I have been on two cruises before 10 years ago with other cruise lines (I think RC and Carnival) and I was completely fine with never going on a cruise again after those two given a very ""meh"" experience. However, we wanted to have a little getaway vacation and thought we'd give it another shot and decided to try Virgin! So glad we did.

  
The Ship:

I was so impressed with the ship overall. Very clean and all of the spaces were beautifully decorated. It was so fun to just take a self tour and get acclimated, though I will say I wasn't familiar with the location of things for at least a full day, simply because it's so big. My favorite spaces in particular were the Runway/Perch (so lovely to walk/jog and see the gorgeous views), and also the Cafe that was up there that serves poke bowls, sometimes we ended up taking food up from the Galley to that area to have lunch. 

  
The Restaurants/Food:

Completely impressed with the food, especially compared to the other cruise line food we've had. Because we booked very late, I think only 3-4 weeks before the cruise, almost every restaurant was booked. Some of them had openings at 9pm, which is simply too late for us (lol) so we ended up not booking everything as we had the impression that you could also get your name on a waiting list. Spoiler alert for us: the waiting list never worked, it was always a ""we'll see if we can get you in at 9pm"". So, we ate a lot in the Galley.

Galley: Because we ate here probably more than most, I will say, I loved it! The first dinner we had they had this really tasty Indian dish. I also loved the build your own salad station. So much in fact that I had a caesar salad every time. We really enjoyed the breakfast station here every morning as well. The bananas and Nutella bread was so good! So was the avacado toast! I also loved the refrigerators next to the doors that you could take food on the go - caesar salad (of course) and other types of salads, trail mixes, charcuterie meats and more were all available. We enjoyed taking these back to our room on the nights we stayed in to watch a movie. 

  
Gunbae: We initially had a 9pm reservation booked just to book something, but initially thought we were just going to cancel it because we ate in the Galley a little earlier. However, we ended up going to a show, and after the show it was about 9pm, and thought, might as well show up for the late dinner! I'm really glad we went, because we ended up meeting a fun group of ladies who we ended up getting together with later on in the cruise as well. The food itself was pretty good, though I was limited on what I ate because I don't eat pork or seafood. What I did have though I enjoyed. My only gripe here was the location of the bathrooms; there are none in the restaurant so you have to walk all the way across the Galley on the other side. I would recommend booking Gunbae earlier on in the cruise so you can have the chance to meet some people!

  
Extra Virgin: This place was completely booked the entire time, not even 9pms were available on the wait list. However, because of the friends we met the day before, they tried to see if they could get us two in with their reservation, and luckily, it worked! I'm so glad, because the food was delicious. The tableside affogato was a great touch!

  
Unfortunately, we weren't able to try the Wake at all or Pink Agave due to them being completely booked up even with the waitlist. 

  
The pizza place was a nice change from the Galley for one night, and super easy to get to go if you would prefer that. We also loved Lick me Til for their ice cream, and we did indulge every day. 

My only cons with food: The free coffee included isn't the best, I'm not a coffee snob but it did leave me wanting for a more elevated coffee (which we could have just bought one but I didn't want one bad enough to spend $7). Also, the water stations had the water jugs sitting really low on the table, so it was difficult to get the water cups under them, I found you couldn't fill them up all the way because they had to be at an angle. 

  
Entertainment:

We are apparently old at heart because we just stayed in the room for two nights instead of going to the parties! Not going to lie, there was just something so novel and fun about getting food to go and bringing it back to the room and watching movies. We saw a few shows, the first one being Around the World with the diva which I could have done without. The actors were all great, it was just not my style. Ship Show however was insane! The acts were all truly incredible. Side note - the food served here was also super good! We tried to get in to the magician's show but the only seats that were left were upstairs and you couldn't even see the stage at all, so we left. 

Activities:

We signed up for a 3 hour spa pass the very first evening and it was a great decision! Almost nobody was in there, and it was so wonderful to relax after a stressful travel day. I loved the steam room and the salt room!

  
I signed up for a salsa class and the instructor was great, kept it light and fun and easy to follow along. We enjoyed the basketball court to ourselves for a bit.

  
Staff: Top notch! Everyone was super friendly and attentive. One morning, the breakfast line was quite long and an employee approached me and said he'd be happy to get my order and bring the breakfast to me, which I was taken aback honestly. Great customer service! I also appreciated how, in the rooms, there are two bottles of water with glasses you can use. If empty, place outside your door, and they'll bring a new refreshed one by when they clean the room! Fantastic!



Port Cities:

I have been to Key West before, and I'm glad I did because we had signed up for an excursion that I would NOT recommend. I thought it would be exploring a nearby beach/state park and wildlife area, and technically it was, but it did not say that the bus ride taking you to this state park was over an hour long each way. The state park/beach was by a bridge and it was tiny and unimpressive. The rest of the tour we spent most of the time in the car, talking about infrastructure and bridges. The wildlife center that we got out at had no wildlife to look at. All in all it took 4-5 hours and we had no time to check out the actual city/downtown, which if you've never been, I would recommend. 

  
Bimini:

  
I'm so glad Bimini was beautiful so we could have an enjoyable day out! The beach club is fun, with jams that I appreciated (being a millennial). The pool party looked fun, but we stayed on the beach area. A con would be there are not enough beach chairs for everybody. We first had to just find a spot and put out towels, but eventually, after maybe 45 minutes, two chairs opened up. The ocean/water was beautiful, it was so fun to just swim around out there and lounge on the beach for most of the day!



All in all, we had a great time. We ended up booking another cruise; Greek Island Glow for next year! Can't wait!

That bout of sickness started the next day around 8ish hours after eating and it began with extreme bloating, nausea and intense sulfur burps to the point where no one could stand to be around me. I finally threw up about 2 days after eating the pork and it was black vomit with the worst smell you could ever imagine, worse than a normal vomit smell. It was as if the food I had eaten had been sitting and rotting in my stomach. The burps finally stopped after 4ish days and I just continued my life as normal thinking it was just a one off.

Later that year (6 months later) I was in Colombia and I ate Chicharron (deep fried pork skin/fat) from a hotel breakfast buffet and again I was sick for about 3 days, with similar symptoms as the first time. I tried to treat both times with antacids, famotidine, omeprazole, probiotics and any stomach pill I had on hand. Nothing works until whatever is in my system makes its way out completely.

I think those were the only 2 incidents I had in 2023, with maybe having had other small reactions that year but it wasn't as extreme or debilitating as the other 2 were, they might have been either only diarrhea/vomiting or only bloating for example. Both of those times were bad enough to make me be more cautious with how long my food had been sitting, and being extra cautious with pork but not avoiding it completely.

In 2024 I visited Colombia again, and this time I avoided eating pork completely and I still got sick. My family hired a local lady to cook for us for the day and I was with my aunt and her kids who asked the lady to make bacon for breakfast. I got to breakfast after everything was already cooked so I didn't see anything being prepared. My breakfast was a fried sweet arepa that doesn't have any sort of meat in it and I didn't touch the bacon at all. A couple of hours later right before lunch, I started to feel nauseous so I skipped lunch and ate watermelon instead. Then I felt even worse and at this point I thought that I must have accidentally ingested some pork since I started burping sulfur. I ended up trying to force myself to vomit digitally which didn't work. My grandma gave me sodium bicarb dissolved in water to try to help the nausea but she might have accidentally put too much because I drank it and I immediately threw everything up. That definitely helped because I wasn't sick for as long with the vomiting and diarrhea lasting only a day ish and the sulfur burps for a while longer. Later on, I thought about everything I had eaten 12-24 hours before I got sick and figured it was probably cross contamination from the bacon grease and whatever oil was used to fry my arepa. I didn't know at the time but it was probably also worsened by the watermelon.

At that point, I figured I probably just should avoid eating pork as much as possible. Again, I still ate it sometimes because I do really like pork (the same way lactose intolerant people will sometimes eat ice cream). So I decided to stick to deli meats (ham, pepperoni, prosciutto) only since I figured they weren't really cooked but cured. The only cooked pork I had that year I think was probably around the holidays since it's hard to avoid pork during the holiday season. Nothing that I can remember gave me the same reaction that I had before.

I know that this isn't normal food poisoning because whoever I'm with will also eat the same food as me and I'm the only one who ever gets sick. I also got sick that same year in Scotland from eating fish and chips. My dad and I shared that plate and we both got sick with the worst food poisoning we had probably ever had (ex. projectile vomiting so severe I could feel my entire abdomen clenching up from the force). This sickness was horrible but it still wasn't as bad as what I felt like those 3 other times after eating pork.

I only got sick one other time in December, not from pork and without the same symptoms, that I'm bringing up because there's a condition that has a sensitivity to all red meats (Alpha-gal syndrome). I went to a friends grad party at night and I had eaten ground meat for dinner the night before (over 24 hours before) and that night during the party I felt nauseous, so I made myself throw up and I threw up the ground beef I had eaten like 30 hours earlier, whole and undigested. I freaked out and thought I had gastroparesis but I don't think I've had anything like that since so it probably isn't that. Since then, I have gotten really bloated and gassy, sometimes even diarrhea from ground meats, both beef and turkey, and steak sometimes gives me the same effect but not every time. 

From then I don't think I had any other reactions, but I might be forgetting stuff. I was still cautious with what I ate but after maybe 8ish months with no reactions I got lulled into a false sense of security and I started eating pork again. Not as much as I used to but at home once in a blue moon or if it was something I really loved or a bite or 2 from a plate that had bacon in it. It seems really dumb to me in hindsight but my thinking at the time was that I didn't want to alter my whole diet forever because I had 3 really bad reactions to pork and it didn't happen every single time I ate pork. I slowly started introducing some pork back into my diet over the beginning of this year, focusing mainly on things that weren't extremely fatty/greasy and bit by bit.

In August 2025, I went to the Dominican Republic and stayed at an all inclusive. One of the nights we went to the Brazilian restaurant, where they bring you the meat on skewers and slice it onto your plate. I avoided the skewers of pork completely and stuck to only eating meat and chicken, but I wasn't really thinking about the sausage that was most definitely pork. I ate maybe a quarter of it or so, since I didn't really like it. I went to sleep that night and felt a little gassy and bloated. I passed gas a couple of times and it smelt so bad that it woke my sister up. At some point in the night, I woke up and felt like I needed to fart again but I decided to be a good sister and go to the bathroom. I proceeded to have 3 hours straight of simultaneous watery diarrhea and vomiting. I had to call my mom to come in from the room next door and hold me up because I was actively fainting but couldn't get off the toilet or let go of the trash can. I was again burping up sulfur. She basically held me up until everything was out of my system. This was possibly the most extreme I got sick to the point I thought I might have to go to the hospital.

We woke up kinda early the next day to go to this waterfall in the middle of the jungle that you had to hike to. That morning since it was early and I didn't have that much of an appetite, I probably had mainly fruit (mango, granadilla, and watermelon) that morning. It's also important to note that I woke up feeling better, with no sulfur burps so I assumed that I had gotten all the pork I ate out of my system.

I'm not sure if this is important to the pork thing but this might be a pre-existing medical condition/symptom but this can be skipped. The week before we left, I had gone to study at a local coffee shop and I walked there, like a mile away. I got to the shop and immediately started feeling faint and I passed out completely for maybe a minute or so. I was wearing my apple watch so I could see that my heart rate increased to the 180s and dropped to the 60s. I'm prone to fainting and vasovagal syncopes but I've never passed out completely before that.

That day at the waterfall everything was fine until about 1 pm when we started to hike back up. I'm also deathly afraid of heights so by the time we made it back up again, I'm not sure if it was a combo of fear, low stamina, and whatever heart problem had happened to me the week before, but I started to faint again. This time I didn't faint completely but I had to sit for a while. We went back to the hotel and grabbed lunch and as I'm walking around the buffet line I feel faint again. I check my watch and my heart rate won't go down from 160-150 even after I sat down for about 20 minutes. I try to drink salted water for electrolytes and more watermelon thinking I'm probably dehydrated. I start to feel nauseous and burp sulfur again, so I go to the bathroom and projectile vomit water and watermelon. I almost faint again and dry heave until I can't anymore.

I take it easy later that day and stick to plain rice and chicken. I start to feel better after sleeping the whole day and not eating anything. I also hadn't burped at all a couple of hours after throwing up. I then decided to eat a slice of pepperoni pizza for dinner, because I'm an idiot and because pepperoni had never affected me before, with a large side of watermelon.

Once again I got sick that night with the exact same symptoms, just less extreme. I later looked it up and watermelon increases sulfur content in the stomach so maybe my body was weak from the night before and a small amount of pepperoni that wouldn't normally affect me did and it was made worse by all the watermelon I had been eating all day.

From that point I've been too scared to eat any pork at all including deli meats, as well as watermelon in case I ate something contaminated and that makes it worse. I've been avoiding everything that has ever even touched pork briefly since I was lowkey traumatized from that. 

Now why I'm asking about this now. I just came back from a trip to Colombia a couple of days ago where I got sick again but this time I've been avoiding pork for months without any incidents of contamination either. I went to the mall and had a burger there. My sister and my dad both got bacon burgers from the same place and neither of them got sick. This is the part that's different from every other time I've gotten sick; I took maybe 2 bites of my burger and started to feel nauseous immediately. Normally, if I got contaminated it takes between 2-12 hours to start to feel the effects, but I felt bad immediately, as if it was food poisoning. I then started thinking that although my burger didn't have bacon on it, it was probably cooked where bacon had been or even with it. My stomach started to hurt worse so, not thinking I was sick already, I went to the bathroom and had diarrhea. Most of my family had already been having diarrhea just because our bodies aren't used to the water there so I assumed it was that, plus a mixture of anxiety because of the burger. I'm still sitting there when I feel the urge to vomit. I text my family and proceed to projectile vomit everything I had eaten that day. Again assuming it's food poisoning, it's not until we're trying to leave and I have to stop to dry heave again that I burp and it smells like eggs. We had to visit family all day after so I threw up again after getting to their house, took an anti-nausea pill and fell asleep in someone's room. I'm still bloated the rest of the day but after that last bout of vomiting I don't think I burped sulfur the rest of the day. I think the fact that I hadn't really digested any of the food before I threw it up, made this time only last about a day.

Nobody else in my family has any sort of pork allergy or intolerance. I've seen that there are 2 options for what I could have but neither really fits, Pork-cat syndrome and Alpha-gal syndrome. I recently developed/found out I have a cat allergy about 2ish years ago, but from what I understand the reaction from pork would be more similar to a normal allergic reaction with hives and anaphylaxis etc. I also don't think I was bitten by a tick over 3 years ago (i feel like i would know right?), and even though I get some indigestion with other red meat it's never as bad.

Please help me figure this out as I don't really want this to be permanent. Also the sulfur burps kill me as I hate eggs with a passion and I don't want to deal with those burps for the rest of my life. If this is something I have to learn to live with I want to learn what exactly it is and what can make it better or worse if I do eat something contaminated with pork, and if I have to avoid other foods that don't necessarily have pork but are made out of pork products like gelatin. Thanks and I appreciate any help or advice, especially on how to decrease sulfur burps if it ever happens again.

  
TLDR: 3 years of gi reactions and sulfur burps after eating pork, lately increasing in intensity, severity and now consistently every time I eat something that touched pork.

I left directions, and trail maps with highlights roughly around where I saw the new trail maker, with my husband this morning in the unlikely event that I am away longer than a day. I finished my coffee, kissed the love of my life goodbye and told him to call me by nightfall if he didn’t see me before then. I generally get decent reception in the forest, save for a few heavily wooded areas, but the marker was near a more sparsely covered area where I knew my reception was good.

I felt some trepidation at the thought of going into this new area blind, but the naturalist forum, where the pictures and information were meant to be posted, had been down all week for maintenance, and I was too excited about exploring the new area to put off this excursion any longer. I spent the walk to the trailhead oscillating between easing my anxiety and tempering my excitement.

It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining and the colder temperatures were still holding off for the most part. So, I only wore a hoodie, fleece-lined pants, and sturdy hiking boots for my trip. I was optimistic that this unseasonably warm and sunny day would mean a pleasant and well-illuminated walk on the new trail. Though should the weather turn I had included additional clothing and provisions in my backpack. Fire starters, a sleeping bag, food and water, to name a few. I had also armed myself with bear mace and a hunting knife. I’d only cause to use the knife once against a sickly coyote, so I was not particularly skilled with the weapon, but I felt safer having it all the same.

After several minutes of searching, I was able to find the trail entrance again with some difficulty. I started to wonder if someone had moved, or possibly removed the sign entirely as I walked up and down the main path. I must’ve passed the entrance to the desire trail twice before noticing the straight lines of a short wooden stake a little further back from the main trail than I remembered.

I picked up speed as I made my way towards the post, sighing at the thought that other people would mess with the sign, but stopped when I noticed that the sign hadn’t just been removed, but broken off the stake rather aggressively. If the splinted wood and tear outs along its length were any indication on this person’s emotional state. This also confirmed my initial suspicion that the stake had been moved back away from the main trail. It was almost nestled behind an oak tree that was to the left of the path, and would have missed it entirely if I hadn’t approached from the west on my second pass.  

It was as though someone couldn’t bare to remove the marker entirely, and moved it further back into the trees to make it harder to find. Then appeared to have thought better of it and broke the sign off to remove the previously welcoming trail marker as well.

I was suddenly reminded of something that I had been mulling over since the first night I checked the forum after finding the trail marker. If there were new species hidden in this part of the forest, then it appeared this naturalist wanted to make a definitive claim on undocumented finds. This theory was bolstered by the fact that they didn’t remove evidence of the trail marker entirely. It was the only conclusion that fit with the placement of the stake and the frenzied removal of the sign.

With renewed vigor, and a degree of smugness, I picked my way through the underbrush to the trailhead while trying to remember if there had been this many bushes and juvenile trees blocking the path entrance the last time I was here. I decided that it must have been and I had been too distracted by the trail marker, and what it might mean, to notice. There was no way that this thick of a tangle could’ve sprouted in only a weeks’ time.

I hadn’t been able to see how far back this route traversed from the main path. However, as I got closer to the opening between a scattering of oak and basswood trees I noted that the path was a straight shot for about 30 feet before dipping down a hill and disappearing from sight. The path was heavily lined with trees of all types native to this area which had created an eerie darkness from the congested tree canopy above. I marveled at the fabricated darkness and felt a visceral tug. As though the creeping dark was beckoning to me to explore its shadowy secrets.

I absently wondered if there would be any bioluminescent species of flora or fauna that might live in this ever-darkening expanse of forest. This musing turned into a dedicated focus that caused dread to claw up my throat as I imagined willingly throwing myself into the dark.

My thoughts were interrupted as my foot caught on something in the path and my world shifted. I fell onto my hands and knees with a grunt of pain and surprise then all I saw was red. I choked out a strangled gasp and rolled sideways away from the source of that unsettling crimson color. I sprang to my feet, hunting knife in hand, ready to slash out at whatever was dying in the hole I tripped over when I realized that the source of my terror was glowing faintly.

I reevaluated the hole, approaching slowly and still keeping my knife at the ready, and noted that some sort of vegetative body was growing out of the ground. Perhaps growing is the wrong word. It appeared as though it was breaking through the hard-packed earth.

I stared for what felt like hours as my brain attempted to catalogue which taxonomic kingdom the glowing red ‘root’ might belong too. I cycled through trees, flowers, lichen and then, with a flash of clarity that rivalled a lightning strike, it suddenly occurred to me that some mycelium glowed and would often push up hyphae or their fruiting bodies through things like packed earth, strangled gardens, and even concrete.

I dropped down to my knees again, a slight zing of pain singing up my leg as I made contact with a rock, and got closer to the hole to observe the glowing growth. I could see broken roots of the surrounding trees through the maw that the mycelium had opened in soil – reminiscent of the latticed indusium of the veiled lady mushrooms.

Needless to say, I was entranced by this marvel. All of my previous fear was forgotten for the moment as my captivation gave way to overwhelming giddiness. I had never read or seen anything like this. Most mycelium was white, beige, orange, brown or even gold, but never red. I had also never heard of mycelium of this width. All the specimens I could remember had delicate filament-like structures.

With my hunting knife already in hand I started to cut away the tree roots surrounding the vibrant and hauntingly beautiful mycelium so I could get a better look into the small fissure. Whether by fate or due to the anxious shaking of my limbs I nicked the mycelium with my knife and the ground shuddered beneath my feet.

I paused, still staring into the hole, transfixed by the ichor that slowly seeped out of the cut my clumsy hands had created. The light of the mycelium dimmed as the fluid continued to flow and then the ground shook again with greater ferocity. I fell onto my ass in the dirt and watched as the thick rope of mycelium pulled itself deeper underground, pulling the earth down with it.

Fear-laced adrenaline filled my veins and scrambled back on my hands before turning over to get to my feet and sprinted down the eerie expanse of track back to the main trail. I didn’t stop or slow as I raced through the woods.

So when Denji, this orphan devil hunter (effectively also a child soldier by the level of danger) who was also forced into extremely dangerous work from a young age, also had his organs removed/replaced (sold in the black market vs human experimentation), also likely rarely got a warm or good meal to eat (in his case, barely anything), tells her that he chooses her over the happy life that he currently has, knowing full well that his quality of life will be significantly worse as a fugitive and is guaranteed to a fate worse than death (loyal devils get no human rights, a devil who aids and abets a murderer would go through something unimaginable), that kind of love and devotion would have been overwhelming for someone as isolated as her.


She couldn't even keep up her lie of never having loved him, she tried to make the Bomb Devil side seem like the only truth, but it was the orphan child soldier who ran up to and hugged another orphan child soldier who chose her over his dream life, until she realized she will condemn the him to a fate worse than death, and made the most genuine hug she ever gave to someone seem like a fake-out with the neck snap. She effectively cursed herself with the lie that was supposed to protect him.


All of Denji's loved ones got to show how much they loved him except for Reze. Denji knew how much Aki cherished him and Power, Power gave him her blood and helped him regain his will to live, Nayuta saved Denji from the mob at her own expense, Asa showed that make him happy for a long time, and save him the way he saved her, even if it's at her expense, Pochita always fought tooth and nail for Denji to have a chance to live out his dreams, even if the world fought to crush those dreams.


She never got to show him that she is willing to be doomed by the eldritch abomination that is Makima if it meant being with Denji for a few more hours or a few more days. The lie she told to protect him was twisted to look like the truth.


Even after all of that, Denji chooses to see her as the girl at the cafe amused by his intolerance of coffee, one of the people he loved and lost. The world gave Denji every reason to see her as the Bomb Devil toying with his feelings for a week before trying to kill him, and he chose to see her as Reze.


That's why, even if they don't end up canon, even if they never see each other again, even if Denji never finds out that Reze actually did love him because lingering curse agenda, I hope that somehow by some miracle Reze atleast gets to know that Denji saw her as his first love, someone he loved and lost, not an assassin who played with his emotions then tried to kill him.

I (20m) went to a party like 8 months ago with my friend looking to talk to some girls, unfortunately that didn’t happen, but that wasn’t the end of the world, we just decided to chill and have fun

Until a couple of drinks later where these two girls separated me and my friend so they could dance with us

I had such a good time with the girl who grabbed me, we were singing together, dancing together, apologies if this is TMI but she started to twerk on me and i enjoyed that very much lol

Eventually the party ended but the girls were out of their mind drunk so me and my friend stayed behind to make sure they got home safely (which they did)

The girl who was dancing with me gave me her snapchat, and this is where i think i failed

I didn’t escalate anything from the party because i assumed she was just drunk and having fun we’ve only been texting sporadically since then

However, i decided to send her a message couple days ago and we’ve been talking ever since, she’s been pretty reciprocative and engaging in the conversation

1pqxiym,https://app.lumo.coffee/early-access,Just launched Lumo.coffee app - a digital espresso recipe handbook & dialing helper,"Hello everyone
I’m Yan, a passionate home barista & IT guy and I recently built a web-based digital espresso recipe handbook (with smart features) that helps you keep track of your favorite recipes and learn to dial-in faster.
I made it because with every new coffee bag I had the same issues….I’d get close to what I liked, change too much, forget what worked, and somehow dialing in the coffee cost me half the bag.
What Lumo App does:
1. Save recipes + shot logs (dose / yield / time / temp / grinder / notes, etc) so you can use the same recipe.
2. Full Recipe creator: snap a photo of the coffee bag or paste the roaster page URL, and it generates a solid starting recipe for straight espresso or milk based drinks.
3. Recipe optimizer: just tell it …this tastes sour, bitter, astringent etc …and it suggests what to change and why (grind, ratio, temp,time) so you’re not guessing and wasting beans
4. Save your home, office or other equipment and link it to the recipes so you know exactly what you used.
+ more features and a lot more to come soon

Works on mobile, tablet & desktop so your recipes are always with you.

If you love coffee and want to check it out, I’m offering an early access for free for the first 100 users in the link below

there are two parts to this post.  
The first one explains why I might be overly cautious.  
The second one is the actual situation I’m dealing with now.

I’ll separate them clearly, so feel free to skip the backstory if you want.

\-----------

How I became cautious (backstory):

This happened back in the 2000's  
Online dating wasn’t really mainstream yet, at least not where I lived.

I met someone in an online chat. We talked there for a while, then exchanged ICQ numbers (yes, that long ago).  
After some time we started talking on the phone, exchanged pictures (no nudity ofc). We spoke regularly for days, maybe weeks. I don’t remember exactly.

Eventually, we decided to meet in person. She lived about 200 km away (\~3 Hours by train), but since things felt really good, I agreed to meet her in her hometown.

I went there, went to the agreed meeting spot, and no one showed up.  
There was only a young couple nearby who kept looking at me and giggling, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

After waiting for about an hour, I accepted that she wasn’t coming and traveled back home.

The next day I received a message.  
She told me she was actually a guy and had been catfishing me “for fun.” but now it was enough.  
When I thought I was talking to her on the phone, it had been his girlfriend. They were both in on it and apparently had a great time at my expense.

I was devastated. I felt humiliated, betrayed, and honestly pretty awful.

That experience stuck with me and made me very cautious when meeting people online.

\-------------

Fast forward to today:

After 15 years of relationship and marriage, I’m single again and back in the dating world.  
I’ve had a few good dates, but nothing serious so far.

Recently, I matched with a woman online, and my gut keeps telling me that something feels off, even though I can’t clearly point to a single red flag.

She says she lives nearby and moved to Germany for work about five years ago.

Her name is very short and not German, which by itself means nothing. It could be a nickname or an international name.

Our texting on Bumble is very minimal.  
Her replies are polite but very short, unemotional, and mostly closed one-sentence answers.  
She rarely asks questions back.

At the same time, she explicitly said she prefers real conversations over endless texting.  
When I suggested meeting for a coffee, she agreed immediately. No hesitation, no excuses.

Now here’s where my doubts kick in:

I usually do a quick sanity check before meeting someone, nothing extreme.  
But I can’t find anything about her online.

* no reverse image search results
* no LinkedIn
* no Facebook
* no professional footprint
* nothing at all

I know some people avoid social media entirely.  
But an international person, working in Germany, around 40 years old, usually leaves some kind of digital trace.

Another thing that adds to my confusion:  
Her profile itself is almost empty. Very little text, no interests listed. The pictures carry the entire profile.  
Some of the pictures also look very polished or heavily edited. Not obviously fake, just unusually clean and “perfect.”

So now I’m stuck between conflicting signals:

* no online footprint at all, feels fishy
* very polished, photogenic pictures, feels fishy
* almost no profile text, feels fishy
* short, closed chat replies, feels fishy
* but clear willingness to meet in public, feels okay

I’m not accusing her of anything, and I’m not trying to catch someone.  
I’m genuinely unsure whether I’m seeing normal variation in communication styles or projecting old experiences onto a situation that doesn’t actually deserve it.

Even if this is a ""scam"" why would someone do this? She didnt try to sell me bitcoin, asked me to join another dating site or tried to move the chat off to Whattsapp or whatever. It just feels like my old experience somehow...

Am I being reasonably cautious here, or am I overthinking this?",0,1766181296.0,datingoverforty,9,0.5,False

**Background:** nearly 2 decades in IT (application development + design). On AWS for a few years (largely serverless/architecture).[](https://spring.io/projects/spring-webflow)**Exam vibe:** scenarios were readable, but most questions came down to two very close answers. I usually found it manageable to eliminate two options,  the real challenge was choosing the best trade-off across networking, security, DR, and multi-account/Organizations. Pacing and mental stamina mattered as much as the technical knowledge.

**What helped most:**

* u/AdrianCantrill course/labs (strong on the “why” behind decisions)
* **Udemy (** u/stephanemaarek **) + Tutorials Dojo practice exams** \- great for benchmarking where you stand, exposing weak areas, and then revisiting those topics to polish them.
* **Neal Davis (Udemy)** \- helpful for a quick final review (often at 1.5×) and to focus on a few weak areas. My prep was on/off over \~2.5 years with a “build knowledge first, certify second” approach, so I used Neal Davis’ shorter course mainly as a quick final revision pass to target a few weak areas.
* **AWS docs/whitepapers** to resolve contradictions
* **AI tools/LLMs** as a rubber-duck for reasoning through tricky options (to understand *why*, not to shortcut)

**Practical tips:**

* Identify the main constraint first (ops vs cost vs resilience vs security) - it usually decides the answer.
* Don’t get stuck: choose best, **flag**, move on, revisit later. I fell into the “perfect answer hunting” trap in the first \~10 questions and had to remind myself frequently ""this isn’t a practice exam"".
* If you can, consider a **test center** \- quick reset breaks (water/coffee/stretch) helped me stay sharp. I honestly think it would’ve been harder to maintain focus at home with everyday interruptions and fewer “reset” moments.

Until a couple of drinks later where these two girls separated me and my friend so they could dance with us

I had such a good time with the girl who grabbed me, we were singing together, dancing together, apologies if this is TMI but she started to twerk on me and i enjoyed that very much lol

Eventually the party ended but the girls were out of their mind drunk so me and my friend stayed behind to make sure they got home safely (which they did)

The girl who was dancing with me gave me her snapchat, and this is where i think i failed

I didn’t escalate anything from the party because i assumed she was just drunk and having fun we’ve only been texting sporadically since then

However, i decided to send her a message couple days ago and we’ve been talking ever since, she’s been pretty reciprocative and engaging in the conversation

I'm running a post-mortem to try and re-recruit for SY, but I want to know if I even stand a chance. 

This is my context/potential excuses to what happened. Will fully disclaim by saying I know I messed up and am trying to bounce back:

\- First time recruiting in the US. Had no idea what a coffee chat was or how to take advantage of one  
\- Tell Me About Yourself was super weak in the beginning. Did not put enough effort early on to perfect it so it was a bit sloppy for initial coffee chats with firms.  
\- Changed cities mid-way. I realized I didn't like the city where I was recruiting for and pivoted in the middle of the process  
\- Struggled to build advocates. I wasn't diligent enough to find people in most firms that I clicked with.   
\- Got super overwhelmed half way: resulted in sloppy execution (delayed thank-you emails, not looking for advice from SYs and career services, etc.)

All being said and done, I realize I didn't stand a chance recruiting for MBB as thing stand. Decided to get serious about all these things, got my resume checked, reached out to all the people I had built relationships, and got the ball rolling in the right direction but I think it was too little too late. 

Now I'm wondering, what does SY recruiting look like? What should I spend time in? How can I set myself up for success to get a second chance at consulting?

• I love stories - books, anime, games, travel - if it has lore, I’m in. If it has *world-building*, I’m emotionally invested.  
• I collect physical media because the apocalypse can take many things, but it will not take my Blu-rays.  
• I’m laid-back, affectionate, mildly goofy, and emotionally available (yes, really).

**What I’m hoping for:**  
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something real - ideally with laughter, mutual hype, and a shared blanket during rainy afternoons. I want stargazing nights, lazy mornings with coffee, and spontaneous adventures that start with “we’ll just go for a bit” and end three hours later.

Bonus points if:  
• You enjoy bad puns  
• You will laugh *with* me when my baking experiments go wrong  
• You understand that “one episode” is a lie we tell ourselves

1pqx5oc,https://i.redd.it/ph4k2t72d88g1.jpeg,Breville Oracle BES980 Auto tamping issue!,"My Breville Oracle recently had an O ring fail resulting in a very damp interior of the machine... This (I assume) led to the failure of the Auto tamping feature.

Currently it grinds coffee but seems to time out rather than stop at the correct dose (overfilling the basket) and never continues running the tamp fan after the grind has stopped.

I pulled opened up the casing for the tamp motor assembly and found the switching mechanism for the dose (picture attached)

It seems to be a sliding potentiometer, it was reading high resistances across the whole slide until I sprayed contact cleaner into it, which cleaned out a bit of rust and debris and got 2ohms at one end, Kohms in the middle and Mohms at the other end.

Without a part number and data sheet I'm assuming these readings are incorrect and that this is the culprit for the failing tamp but I haven't looked at the control board it's connected to yet.

Does anyone else have experience with this?

I am an outside hire for the Food/Bev TL position at Target. From my understanding, I will mostly be managing the Starbucks. I start in a couple weeks.
I've heard some horror stories on Reddit about the Food Team Lead position being one of the toughest ones. 

Background: I have 5 years of management experience in a coffee chain, and about a year of retail experience as a grocery delivery dispenser and organizer (non management) I also worked in a very short staffed nursing home for a couple years, so chaos and heavy work load doesn't phase me too much.

I nervous, and couldn't of any questions on the spot, not that it's settled in some, I have a few.
 If anyone experienced is willing to help me out, I'd really appreciate it. 

How throughough is the training? It seemed like they really just focused on encouraging work ethic, high morale and energy. But, of course, there's more I need to know. 

What does the typical day look like, and what are some daily or weekly tasks/goals expected? I'm aware it's a heavy work load, but what all does that include?

Specifically, what kind of managerial duties are typically carried out by this role, and what things aren't. Who exactly is above me, and what resources do they offer for barriers I may run into. 

Does upper management assign tasks for me, or is that something I'll need to figure out? 
How involved is upper management and how is performance tracked?

How do you go about deligating tasks at target? Is it more correction while working and observing as a team member/setting annexample
Or is it less personal? I'm used to working as a team member, and doing managerial duties on downtime.

During my role, I became aware of widespread unpatched security vulnerabilities across numerous customer environments. These sites were under active maintenance contracts with my employer. Despite repeated internal requests and written recommendations to address these risks, remediation was consistently deprioritized in favor of commercial considerations.

When I escalated these concerns beyond my direct reporting line to regional leadership, I was instructed by my manager to stop pursuing the matter. Shortly thereafter, I was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan and subsequently terminated. I have formally challenged this termination before the Swiss Employment Court.

Due to the sensitive and ongoing nature of the case, I cannot disclose identifying details publicly. However, I am looking for informed perspectives to help me stress-test my arguments and prepare for upcoming hearings. I am also considering responsible engagement with media at a later stage.

I am looking for 5–6 volunteers who would be willing to:  
• Review selected case documents  
• Share professional opinions  
• Help identify strengths, weaknesses, and counter-arguments

Relevant backgrounds include:

1. Swiss employment / labor law
2. Technology or cybersecurity journalism
3. Cybersecurity regulation or policy
4. Senior cybersecurity professionals
5. Social media professionals with experience in public-interest cases

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Been thinking a lot lately about how we chase these massive, life-altering goals, and don't get me wrong, that's awesome. But sometimes, the sheer scale of it all can feel… well, overwhelming. We get stuck, waiting for that perfect moment or that massive surge of motivation that never quite arrives.

What if the real secret sauce to incredible progress wasn't about giant leaps, but about consistent, almost imperceptible steps?

Think about it. We're talking about the power of tiny habits, the ripple effect of small decisions.

*   **Waking up 15 minutes earlier.** Just enough time for a quiet coffee, some stretches, or to jot down your top 3 priorities for the day.
*   **Adding one extra serving of veggies to your dinner.** Small nutrition win, big long-term health impact.
*   **Taking 5 minutes to do some deep breathing when you feel stressed.** Instant calm, better decision-making.
*   **Sending a quick, genuine compliment to someone.** Boosts their day, and yours.
*   **Reading just one page of a book you love before bed.** Never underestimate the power of consistent learning.

These aren't earth-shattering changes, right? They don't require a complete overhaul of your life overnight. But over weeks, months, and years? The compound effect is absolutely mind-blowing. You build momentum, gain confidence, and suddenly, those ""huge impacts"" you were dreaming of start showing up.

It’s about cultivating that **feeling** of progress, day in and day out. It’s about giving yourself permission to start small, to be imperfect, and to trust the process.

Sometimes, when we're navigating these shifts, even the small stuff can feel heavy. If you're ever looking for extra support and guidance to help you through, I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) to be incredibly helpful.

What are some of your favorite ""small changes, huge impact"" wins? I'd love to hear what's been working for you! Let's inspire each other. ✨",1,1766179963.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I want to have a very chill day walking around and trying pastries, maybe seeing some art or churches. Do people have recs on what I can explore?

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your secret weapon for making money while you sleep, travel, or binge-watch your favorite shows. 🚀

Here are **3 actionable ways** to leverage AI for content-based passive income—no tech degree required!

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The ""Set It & Forget It"" Goldmine)**
- **Pick a micro-niche** (think ""vegan meal prep for busy parents"" or ""budget gaming setups for college students""). The more specific, the better!
- **Use AI tools** like Jasper or SurferSEO to generate SEO-optimized blog posts. Feed it a few keywords, tweak the output, and boom—content that ranks.
- **Monetize with ads + affiliates**: Slap on Google AdSense or Amazon Affiliate links. Once traffic rolls in, you’re earning while you sip coffee. ☕
- **Pro tip**: Automate social media promo with tools like Buffer or Hootsuite to drive traffic on autopilot.

**Why it works?** AI writes *fast*, and niche blogs have crazy-low competition. Scale this to 5-10 sites, and you’ve got a portfolio of income streams.

---

### **2. AI-Powered YouTube Shorts/TikTok Clips (Viral Content on Repeat)**
- **Repurpose long-form content** (or let AI generate scripts) into bite-sized clips. Tools like Pictory or InVideo turn blog posts into engaging videos in minutes.
- **Use AI voiceovers** (e.g., Murf or ElevenLabs) to narrate scripts—no camera-shy excuses!
- **Automate posting**: Schedule clips with CapCut or TikTok’s built-in tools. Consistency = algorithm love. ❤️
- **Monetize**: Ad revenue, sponsorships, or funnel viewers to your blog/affiliate links.

**Why it works?** Short-form video is *still* king in 2026, and AI lets you pump out content without burning out.

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The ""Lazy"" Influencer Hack)**
- **Find a hungry audience** (e.g., ""AI tools for solopreneurs"" or ""sustainable fashion deals"").
- **Use AI to curate content**: Tools like Curated.co or Beehiiv’s AI assistant scrape the web for trending topics in your niche. Add your 2 cents, hit send.
- **Monetize**: Sponsorships, paid subscriptions (via Substack), or affiliate products. Even 1,000 subscribers can net $500+/month.
- **Grow it**: Use AI to write Twitter threads or LinkedIn posts promoting your newsletter. Cross-promo = free subscribers!

**Why it works?** People *crave* curated info. AI does the heavy lifting; you just add personality.

---

**Final thought:** The key to passive income? **Start small, automate fast, and scale smart.** Pick *one* of these, test it for 30 days, and refine.

Oh, and speaking of scaling—**I recently stumbled on a community that’s all about automated reselling with *guaranteed* 10x ROI.** They send daily ""secret deal"" alerts, and I’m experimenting with it now. If you’re curious, here’s my affiliate link to check it out: [https://clipwise.ai/?utm_source=affiliate&linkId=lp_603470&sourceId=liveitup-deals&tenantId=clipwise&affS1=reddit].

1pqwvz6,https://tipstor.com/shop/kindle-paperwhite-2/,Kindle Paperwhite,"Airports are where good intentions go to die. Travelers lug novels the size of bricks through security, swearing they’ll finally finish them between flights and hotel bars. By the end of the trip, the books have done little more than add weight and guilt. The smarter travelers—the ones who’ve evolved beyond literary masochism. Carry an e-reader. The Kindle Paperwhite and its rivals are the best travel hack for anyone who loves words but hates the baggage that comes with them.

It’s not just about convenience. It’s liberation. A Kindle weighs less than a cup of coffee and holds an entire library. Thousands of stories, guides, and guilty pleasures inside a shell thinner than a passport. The glare-free screen reads clean in any light, from a sun-drenched beach in Lisbon to the dim overhead flicker of a budget flight over the Atlantic. The battery lasts weeks, not hours, which feels like sorcery in a world where phones die faster than optimism.

On Amazon, the Kindle Paperwhite sits around USD 150, while the more stripped-down models hover near USD 100. Alternatives like Kobo or PocketBook play in the same price range, each one giving travelers the freedom to carry a bookstore in their jacket pocket. Load it with a few travel memoirs, a local phrasebook, or even something pretentious for late-night train rides. It all fits without the burden of bulk or broken spines.

There’s a quiet dignity in reading while in motion, flipping through digital pages as cities blur past the window. An e-reader doesn’t just save space. It restores an old rhythm to travel. The unhurried pause, the moment of reflection, the story that bridges the distance between places. The best travel hack isn’t flashy or high-tech. It’s the one that brings silence back to the journey. A Kindle doesn’t beep, buzz, or demand attention. It just waits, patiently, for the next chapter.

# Weather & This Weekend's Outlook:

As you could probably already tell, Friday morning's 55 mph gusts turned into super heavy rain this afternoon. Temperatures are crashing tonight with rain flipping to snow so watch for icy spots as standing water freezes. Saturday brings some morning sunshine before clouds roll back in, and Sunday looks like a few flurries with highs in the 30s. Monday turns properly cold with lows in the teens, but a Tuesday snow event could build the snowpack and improve our odds for a White Christmas.

1pqwszf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pqwszf/dd_pt_1/,DD Pt 1,"""How long did you say?"" Asked the scrawny man sitting in the passenger seat. A raspy tone filled his voice from years of smoke inhalation. Likely responsible for the stench within the cabin.



The driver let off the gas a moment, and released his left hand from the worn wheel of the 1987 Ford Lariat. He began to quickly roll down the window. \*cough\* ""About 9, wanna take over?"" His voice had a drawl, but with the same accent as his passenger; West Coast. He takes a moment to inhale a long breath while pellets of hail bombard the interior, followed by a strong gust of icy wind. 



The passenger partially guards his face with the collar of his hoodie, yelling over the cliff's downdraft. ""Of course Bro! Let's just st-"" before he could finish, the driver rolled up the window. ""You could've left that open, it's cool.""



""I'm all right now; just wanted a little fresh air."" The driver scratched at a patch of razor burn high up on his cheek. ""How 'bout we swap in Bridgeport after we grab some coffee?""



""Sounds good.""



The interior of the cabin was littered with various sports drinks and to-go bags, a bottle on the floor was filled halfway with a black, tarry substance. Several grocery store bags sit behind the men; Filled with more bottles, wrappers, and bottles filled with the tar. Besides all the garbage, the interior is in pristine condition. In the bed of the truck are three large bags, one significantly larger than the two. A few moments of silence passed, and the men pulled off the highway and into the nearest mini-mart.



The driver hopped out of the truck. He wore a burgundy sweater, size 14 hiking boots, and a pair of dark-grey cargo-style pants with a large pocket on either side, that bulged slightly. His rear pockets appeared empty while his wallet and phone sat in his left and right front pockets, respectively. Letting out a large groan, he stretched and then looked into the back seat as the passenger leapt out of the vehicle. ""Yo, Theo!""



Theo let out a similar groan as he stretched his legs and began touching his toes. He wore an oversized hoodie stuffed with a bag of marijuana, a small glass pipe, a paperclip, and an empty Bic lighter. Baggy blue jeans sat crooked on this thin waist in absence of a proper belt, the ends being tucked-in to the tops of his size 12 Osiris'. ""What's up?!"" He shouted beneath the truck. 



The direction of the sound made the driver jump momentarily. He scanned his surroundings and saw a large dumpster alongside the minimart. ""Let's toss this shit before we head out; getting ripe in there.""



""Copy that. The usual?"" Asked Theo.



The driver nodded, and the pair split up as soon as they entered the establishment, Theo went straight for snacks and necessities, while the driver went for coffee. 



The driver seemed displeased with the coffee selection. He tried the Maxwell House, but winced at as he did so. Next he began to try the Folgers, but noted that the grounds in its reservoir was completely full, while the dispenser and subsequent tray beneath, was covered in dust. ""You must be the un-popular one,"" he muttered to himself. Deciding on the Red Diamond roast for the both of them. He topped off his own brew with some creamers, then unloaded ten creamers into the passenger's cup, and filled the remaining volume with fresh steaming coffee. The steam felt good on the driver's face, so he opted to forego the lid on his own cup and sip right out of it. He capped-off the passenger's coffee, pocketed an extra handful of creamers and started walking towards the counter.



The two men head towards the cashier. She must have been around 50 years old. A short woman, with hair that fell to her shoulders. Theo gingerly rested a pile in front of the woman: Two bags of peach rings, two bags of butter-toffee peanuts, two bags of southwest trail mix. A bottle of Ibuprofen, a six pack of Coronas, a new lighter, and a tall can of sour cream and onion Pringles. ""Hey, do you guys have a restroom?"" Asked Theo.



She nodded and turned to grab a key with a large toilet scrubber attached by a length of paracord.

""Just down the hall,"" she pointed down a short hallway. ""Door on the right. That towel things likes to jam, be nice to it.""



Theo nodded and made a brisk walk down the hall, quickly shutting the door behind him.



""Where're you boys headed'?"" Her voice was calm and trustworthy, but frail, as if she had been crying. A stark contrast from her hands that raced across the surface of the table, grabbing and scanning the items.



The driver grabbed the Ibuprofen and sat it back on the shelf before she could scan it, ""We're visiting every National Park; On our way to Glacier right now.""



""Gotcha, are you sure this will be enough then?"" The woman asked with what felt like genuine concern. 



""Should be, but if not, we'll be passing through Spokane in a few hours; We can stock up there.""



""Fair enough, I.D?"" She held out her free hand, the other placed on top of the Coronas.



The driver quickly pulled a card out of his wallet and handed it to her. She froze, her voice choked as she fought back tears. ""I-I'm sorry I just need your drivers license."" She handed it back, he looked down at his Common Access Card and apologized. 



""Sorry ma'am, my mistake."" He pulled his drivers license out and handed it to the woman, he waited a moment as she inspected it, slowly. ""You okay?""



She looked up from the card and wiped her eyes. ""Y-yes,."" She composed herself, ""That'll be $15.97.""



\*The bathroom door creaks loudly as it swings open, grabbing the cashier and driver's attention\* 



Theo walks out patting his hands on his hoodie and pants, noticing the receipt in the driver's hand he shouts from across the mini-mart, ""What the hell man? Thought I was getting this one.""



""You are."" The driver turned his attention to the cashier, ""Can I also get $50 on pump 2?""



""Of course, dear."" She said warmly.



""Oh so it's like that?"" Theo said sarcastically, handing the woman a crumpled $50 bill out of his hoodie. She looked down at the bill with a minor look of disgust before swiping it with a pen to confirm its legitimacy. 



""Should be good to go now, here's the receipt."" She starts handing the receipt to Theo, but he refuses. 



""Sorry ma'am, I don't wanna leave a paper trail."" Said Theo as he turns towards the automatic double-doors. She rolled her eyes and threw the receipt into a small trash can behind the counter. The driver followed behind shortly after. 



As the driver was about to leave, she ran around the counter. She firmly wrapped her thin arms around the drivers waist and buried her face into the small of his back, sobbing. The driver was stunned, unable to speak, all he could do was try to turn around to see the woman's face.



""I'm so sorry."" She sobbed, stepping away. ""M-my son was, he. He was. They sent him t-""



""It's okay, what was his name?"" Asked the driver in a soft tone of voice.



""Nicolas,"" she sniffled then looked up at the driver, ""his friends in the Guard used to call him 'Saint Nick', after he grew out his beard"" she chuckled, so did the driver. 



Theo looked back at them through the storefront's windows, from the pump stall. Once he got the driver's attention he mouthed 'what the fuck?' and gestured at a imaginary watch on his wrist. The driver nodded. 



""I oughta get going ma'am, I'm sorry about your son.""



""Please,"" she wiped her eyes one last time, ""just be careful,""



""I will."" The driver walked out of the mini-mart with a waving gesture towards the old woman.



""What the hell was that about?"" Theo squinted at the driver as he approached.



""Her son was National Guard, we was killed during the Liberty Collapse. His name was Nicolas...""



""Woah. Sounds like bad juju Nik, lets get the fuck out of here.""



""Copy that.""



Nik and Theo hop back into the truck, taking time to adjust their new seats before pulling back onto the highway. 



An hour into the drive, Theo says ""-Oh shit, we totally forgot to dump all this"" Theo gestured with his thumb at the mound of trash in the back seats. ""There's a Safeway in Spokane, we can just unload there.""



""Sounds good...  you sure we weren't supposed to take that exit?"" asked Nik as he began rolling his window. The storm had died down to just a couple hard gusts. He sat staring at the swollen Spokane River, watching the churning waters eat up vegetation along the banks, rising diligently.



""Yes dude, says right here on th-"" Theo began to fiddle with their map.



In an instant, a large portion of the road in front of them is swallowed whole. 



""Fuck!"" Screams Theo, in a panic he slams on the breaks and veers the car to the right, away from the river. Upon leaving the paved road, the passenger-side tires lurch downward as more of the road's foundation slips away. Theo starts backing up, but the tires find no purchase on the asphalt. ""What the fuck did I say Nik?!""



""Yeah, yeah bad fuckin' juju. Just get out!"" Yells Nik as he begins to unbuckle. Have they done this before?



 The truck begins to slip further into the river while Theo easily climbs out. As he does so, the weight distribution is thrown off; Nik's side is sent further down. Theo sprints to the bed, grabs ahold and squats down; Slightly altering the course of the careening Lariat. Nik scrambles out of his seatbelt, crawls over the center console and falls on top of the remaining road. Letting out a loud grunt as he fell onto his right shoulder. As Nik falls, so does the Lariat; Forcing Theo to lose his grip, slicing open his palms, and sending him backwards, slamming the back of his head on the unkempt road.



Nik dusts himself off as the Lariat is eaten by the ravenous current, ""I'm sorry,"" he whispers to himself. 



To his right, he sees Theo unconscious. Turning him over to inspect his injuries, Nik let's out a sigh of relief and scoops him up off the ground, as if carrying an infant. As the rain grew more intense and pieces of the highway unraveled, Nik's only choice was to venture in to the woods.



He goes on for what must have felt hours, until coming across my clearing. In the dark, illuminated by the full moon, Nik spots the small shack. A large wooden door marks the entry. As Nik drew closer, he couldn't help but appreciate the neatly chip-carved geometry of the door. Curves undulated across it's surface, as if it were seen through murky waters. A dark, somber hue, stained the main body of the wood a lovely, deep-red color while the border was etched with charcoal-colored runes. He hoists Theo onto his shoulder, and takes hold of the handle. His hand sank deeply into the bronze casting, the ergonomic fit beckoning, urging him into the frame, across the threshold. 



""Go."" I whispered as he began to turn the handle.



Nik looked back, startled, as we walked through the frame together before losing his footing, and landing face first on to wet cobblestone streets.

Ironically, I ended up more focused afterward.

Grind is on factory setting which is 3 and it did seem bitter.

Also important to note that this was the 4th drink I made (the 3 before I tossed) and the first milk drink.

then she stops by the shop again and needed to meet her sister at the mall for christmas shopping and i met her sister with a coffee i made her. we have a date planned for sunday in nyc.

I’m not a “big gifts” person, but I do care about effort. I planned the whole night: I booked a little Italian place we both like, dressed up, and I made him a small photo book at home with dumb inside jokes (it took forever, my printer hates me). I also got him a nice chef’s knife because he’s been cooking more and keeps stealing mine.

At dinner he slid a small envelope across the table and did that grin like “wait for it.” Inside was a receipt and confirmation email for a weekend “coffee immersion” workshop. Sounds cute, right. Except it’s at the fancy roastery he’s obsessed with, it’s all about dialing in espresso, milk texturing, latte art, etc. I don’t even drink coffee. I have maybe 3 iced lattes a year, and he always teases me for ordering “dessert drinks.” He said “I got it under your name so it’s your gift, but obviously we’ll go together and you’ll finally learn to appreciate real coffee.”

I just kind of stared. He started talking about the machines they use and how he’s going to ask the instructor a million questions. I said, very calmly at first, that this doesn’t feel like it was for me. He got annoyed and said I’m being ungrateful, that it’s an experience, and “couples do stuff together.” I said couples do, yeah, but usually it’s something both people actually enjoy? He rolled his eyes and did the “wow” thing, like I was embarrassing him.

Then he said, in the middle of the restaurant, “You always make gifts into a test.” That hit a nerve. I paid for my part, stood up, and left. I didn’t yell, but I definitely was shaky. Now he’s texting me that I ruined our anniversary, and his sister messaged me saying I’m a jerk for storming out over “a thoughtful gift.”

TL;DR: He bought an anniversary gift in my name that’s basically his hobby, and I left dinner when he got snippy about it. AITJ?

You will thank me later :)

Okay back to the review...

# 🧩 1. What Is Marsses Supposed to Be?

https://preview.redd.it/4kf46ze1788g1.jpg?width=332&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afd4c6c988dfc7e761a5226ea46647dc24174896

According to Marsses, they are:

• a staking platform  
• a DePIN infrastructure  
• a validator network  
• a liquid staking protocol  
• a marketplace  
• a financial services ecosystem  
• possibly a small country judging by the claims

All rolled into **one website**.

This pitch sounds impressive until you realize it’s the same recycled crypto buzzword soup — just arranged with cleaner icons and longer paragraphs.

Marsses claims users can earn:

💰 **0.48% – 0.88% daily**  
💰 **Up to 250%+ total returns**  
💰 “Full asset custody”  
💰 “No smart contract exposure”  
💰 Zero-risk vibes (somehow)

If that sounds *too* perfect…  
That’s because it is.

# 🧮 2. Let’s Talk About the Math (Because Math Still Exists)

Daily returns sound small until you zoom out:

• **0.5% daily ≈ 182% annually**  
• **0.8% daily ≈ 292% annually**  
• Some plans magically exceed **200–250% total ROI**

That’s not conservative staking.

That’s **hedge-fund-level returns** without hedge-fund-level:

• disclosure  
• audits  
• regulation  
• accountability

Real validators don’t promise fixed daily ranges.  
Real staking rewards fluctuate.  
Real protocols don’t guarantee outcomes.

Marsses guarantees **confidence**.

# 🧊 3. “Trusted by 5,000,000 Users” — Sure…

This one deserves a pause.

Marsses claims:

• 5 million users  
• $193M+ staked  
• 98.8% uptime  
• global infrastructure  
• enterprise partnerships

Yet somehow…

• no public on-chain dashboards  
• no widely referenced audits  
• no protocol transparency matching that scale  
• no third-party validation proportional to the claims

If Marsses truly had **5 million users**, they’d be one of the largest crypto platforms on Earth.

Coinbase has fewer *active* users than that.

Yet Marsses mostly exists in…  
its own ecosystem.

Interesting.

# 🧠 4. The Leadership Team (AKA: The AI Avengers)

https://preview.redd.it/y58pz7c2788g1.jpg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c550bbd9476ec0f59d56de1b0bcf6939677ac7de

Now for my favorite part.

The leadership lineup reads like a LinkedIn fantasy draft:

• CEO with “global experience”  
• CTO “specializing in advanced systems”  
• CFO with elite finance background  
• Legal officer from a top law school  
• Data scientists with PhDs

And yet…

• several executives have **brand-new LinkedIn profiles**  
• some X (Twitter) accounts are **banned**  
• others have **no digital footprint**  
• profile photos look suspiciously… *generated*

Not low-key professionals.  
Not privacy-focused builders.

More like:  
**stock photo + AI headshot + corporate Mad Libs**.

If you’re running a $190M+ platform, your leadership doesn’t disappear when someone Googles them.

# 🍽️ 5. The “Everything Platform” Problem

Marsses offers:

• node staking  
• liquid staking  
• validator delegation  
• RPC infrastructure  
• DePIN nodes  
• perpetual markets  
• affiliate systems  
• high-yield pools  
• automated rebalancing  
• institutional-grade protection

That’s not focus.

That’s **feature inflation**.

Real projects specialize.  
Shady ones accumulate features to distract.

If you can’t clearly explain:

• where yield comes from  
• how risk is managed  
• what happens in drawdowns  
• who eats losses

Then the complexity isn’t sophistication —  
it’s camouflage.

# 🔁 6. Affiliate Program: The Quiet Centerpiece

This part matters more than most people admit.

Marsses runs a **deep, rank-based affiliate structure** with:

• multiple levels  
• turnover requirements  
• investment commissions  
• income-based rewards  
• rank incentives

Affiliate systems aren’t automatically bad.

But when **expansion mechanics get more clarity than the product**, priorities show.

Many platforms don’t collapse because markets fail —  
they collapse because **recruitment outpaces sustainability**.

And Marsses spends a *lot* of screen space on growth mechanics.

# 🛡️ 7. Security, Insurance & Comfort Words™

Marsses uses phrases like:

• “insurance guarantees”  
• “protection fund”  
• “multi-layer security”  
• “legal compliance”

Here’s the issue:

Words are cheap.

• Insurance without policy details = decoration  
• Protection funds without proof = vibes  
• Compliance without filings = marketing

Nothing here is independently verifiable **at the scale claimed**.

# 🔍 8. The Pattern Is Familiar

If you’ve seen enough of these platforms, the pattern jumps out:

• big numbers up front  
• polished design  
• heavy marketing language  
• endless features  
• aggressive compounding  
• mystery leadership  
• affiliate-driven expansion  
• minimal hard verification

Marsses isn’t uniquely bad.

It’s painfully familiar.

# ⚖️ PROS & CONS

# ✅ Pros

• Polished website  
• Wide asset support  
• Clean UI  
• Appealing yields (on paper)  
• Easy onboarding

# ❌ Cons

• Unrealistic long-term returns  
• Leadership credibility issues  
• Marketing > transparency  
• Affiliate-heavy growth model  
• Lack of proof matching claims  
• “Too many things at once” syndrome

# 🚨 Final Verdict — Should You Trust Marsses?

https://preview.redd.it/jfw04s63788g1.jpg?width=2495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01bf5d878f6ce58a8eb4f93fa561a1d7b22e2a2c

Here’s the honest take.

Marsses isn’t obviously legit.  
And it’s not obviously dead.

It lives in the **danger zone** where:

• early users may get paid  
• everything feels professional  
• numbers look reasonable *at first*  
• but foundations raise more questions than answers

That’s where people lose money **slowly**, not instantly.

If you’re looking for:

• transparent protocols  
• verifiable leadership  
• sustainable yield  
• real accountability

Marsses does **not** check those boxes.

If you’re comfortable with:

• elevated risk  
• marketing-heavy platforms  
• affiliate-driven growth  
• trusting claims over proof

At least be honest about what you’re participating in.

# 🧠 Final Thought

Marsses doesn’t fail the smell test because it looks cheap.

It fails because it looks **too perfect**, too busy, too polished —  
and too vague where it matters most.

And in crypto, when **everything is promised and nothing is proven**…

That’s usually the real product.

# 💰 Want Cashflow Without Guessing?

If you’re tired of:

• shiny dashboards  
• mystery teams  
• “up to” returns  
• hoping withdrawals keep working

There *are* ways to earn **3%–10% per month** in crypto:

• no trading  
• no bots  
• no leverage  
• no presales  
• full asset control

1pqwb1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1pqwb1n/olympic_orchards_review/,Olympic Orchards review,"I recently got into perfumes, and have been having fun exploring a wide range of samples.  I got a set of 10 samples from Olympic Orchards (which are outrageously affordable, especially with the current winter sale) and wanted to share my thoughts!  I don't have a super sensitive nose, but thought these reviews might be useful for others like me.

Overall, I was really impressed by this house!  I tend to have a very low hit rate for finding fragrances that I love, and there were at least 3 that I'll consider getting larger samples of.

**OLYMPIC RAINFOREST**  
*Notes: cedar leaves, green sword ferns, rhododendron, forest mushrooms, beebalm, myrtle, wildflowers, oakmoss, black spruce, balsam fir, Port Orford Cedar, earthy accord.*  
Opens very green.  A hint of pine, but not overwhelmingly so. I get a light floral and a light sweetness.  It’s much smoother than I expected.  I think this is sweeter than I want for a fragrance that’s meant to smell like a forest.  3/5

**SEATTLE CHOCOLATE**  
*Notes: dark cacao, black Bourbon vanilla, sweet poplar bud, evergreen wood, oakmoss, gourmand musk, silver fir, and fir balsam absolute.*  
I get the green, I get the chocolate, I get some earthiness.  This fragrance is fairly subtle on me.  I don’t have strong feelings about it. I think, for me, these notes don’t feel like they belong together.  2/5

**WOODCUT**  
*Notes: Fractional distillations of pine and cedar, oakwood absolute, tolu balsam, olibanum, caramel, burnt sugar, vanilla.*  
A warm aromatic wood, resinous and a little smoky.  From reviews I expected this to be dusty and dry, but I don’t get that at all.  There’s a little bit of creaminess, so maybe that’s the vanilla coming through.  This feels like the punk rock younger sister of Liis Bo.  I love it!  5/5

**TUCSON**  
*Notes: ponderosa pine, Southwest juniper, acacia, sagebrush, and chaparral.*  
Very aromatic and dry - definitely getting sage, and possibly some smoke or incense?  I’m not sure I get the pine or juniper, though there’s a little greenness there if I really look for it.  This is very different from my usual favorites, but I like it a lot! 4/5

**OSAFUME**  
*Notes: anise, magnolia heliotrope, vanilla, airy notes, and white musk.*  
Opens with a strong super-sweet candy-like note.  It then tones down quite a bit, and I honestly can’t get much from it at all.  Just a subtle sweetness.  2/5

**MARDI GRAS**  
*Notes: Orange blossom, neroli, cistus, benzoin, vanilla, civet, special musk blend.*  
Initially I get the sweet lightness of the orange blossom and neroli, and then WHOA the civet and musks come through.  I haven’t tried much in the way of animalics before, and I think they’re just not for me. They do tame down after a bit.   2/5

**CAFE V**  
*Notes: espresso-roast coffee, dark cacao, vanilla, cream, spicy chai, cardamom, leather, and well-worn wood.*  
I’m befuddled by this perfume.  Right off the bat I feel like I’m smelling mint.  I also kind of get the chocolate, but this is so much lighter and fresher than I expected it to be based on the notes.  After lots of sniffing my wrist and looking at the notes, I think I must be smelling the cardamom. Google tells me that cardamom can have hints of mint. It’s not really cinnamony like I’d normally expect, but a light fresh spicy.   I don’t know.  I don’t get coffee, I don’t get leather, but I really like this. 4???/5

**AFRICAN ORCHID**  
*Notes: Orchid, jasmine grandiflorum, ylang-ylang, nectar, birch, clove, passionfruit, light woody musks, New Caledonian sandalwood, Madagascar vanilla.*  
Sweet, humid, tropical florals with a musky note, occasionally reading as a burnt plasticy note.  This one isn’t for me! 2/5

**BALLETS ROUGES**  
*Notes: Bergamot, aldehydes, red mandarin, fresh rose accord, rose de mai absolute, ylang-ylang, red thyme, oakmoss, patchouli labdanum, and musks.*  
I read online that this fragrance was powerful, and that’s VERY TRUE.  This is a perfume that swaggers into a room.  This is a perfume that I fear would wear me, instead of the other way around.  I honestly can’t pick out any of the individual notes, though they all make sense.  The only way I can describe this is that it feels like some kind of soft, velvety fabric in a deep wine red color.  That’s all I got.  I just started my fragrance journey a few months ago - I’m going to stick this in a drawer for a few years and see how I feel then!  For now, not for me.  2/5

**CAROLINA**  
*Notes: longleaf pine, hay absolute, magnolia, kudzu flower, tea, honeysuckle, star jasmine, vanilla, tonka, and tobacco leaf.*  
Opens with a bit of spice, and quickly goes green. The florals slowly come in, and the overall impression is very sweet and grassy.  The first time I wore this I wasn’t super excited, but the second time it gave me strong impressions of working in my garden.  It smells like spending hours pulling weeds amongst my flowers, which is one of my favorites places to be. 4.5/5

1pqw9y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pqw9y4/a_crisis_line_caller_knew_my_thoughts/,A crisis line caller knew my thoughts.,"I volunteer on a crisis line a couple nights a month. It’s not heroic. It’s not a calling. It’s a job you do with a headset on, in a room where everyone speaks quietly like noise might break something.

You learn the scripts. You learn the protocols. You learn how to keep your voice steady when someone else’s isn’t.

Most calls are lonely, not dramatic. People who don’t want to wake their partner up. People sitting in their car in a parking lot because going home feels worse. People who are not actively dying, but are thinking about it too much.

You get used to the rhythm.

Greeting. Name of the service. Consent to continue. Basic safety questions. Then the real work, which is mostly just staying with someone long enough that the moment passes.

We’re told not to take things personally. We’re told not to try to be a savior. We’re told to keep boundaries.

And we’re told, a lot, that the calls are recorded.

That part matters.

The night this happened, the room was half full. Low lights. Computer monitors. The sound of other people murmuring into headsets. I was three hours into my shift and feeling that specific kind of tired where your body is calm but your thoughts start to drift.

I remember thinking, very clearly, that I wanted to get through the rest of the night without anything heavy.

Then my line lit up.

No caller ID. That happens sometimes. Some carriers block it. Some people use apps. It’s not automatically weird.

I clicked accept.

“Thank you for calling,” I said. “You’ve reached the crisis line. My name is Joe. What’s going on tonight?”

There was a pause. Not dead air. Breathing. Like they were smiling quietly on the other end.

Then a voice said, “Hi, Joe.”

Not “hello.” Not “sir.” Not “I need help.”

Just my name.

My stomach did that small drop it does when something isn’t following the pattern.

I kept my tone the same. Professional. Neutral.

“Hi,” I said. “What can I help you with tonight?”

Another pause.

Then: “You always do that. You always pretend it’s normal first.”

I sat a little straighter in my chair.

Prank calls happen. Usually they’re sloppy. Teenagers trying to shock you. People breathing heavy. People trying to bait you into breaking script so they can laugh.

This didn’t sound like that.

This sounded… familiar. Not the voice. The cadence.

Measured. Controlled. Like someone who knows the rules.

“Okay,” I said. “It sounds like you know me. Can you tell me your name?”

The caller breathed out, almost like a laugh, but smaller.

“I’m calling ahead,” they said.

“Calling ahead of what?”

“Of you,” they said, like it should’ve been obvious. “Of what you’re going to do.”

I felt my mouth go dry. I glanced at the monitor like it would give me a normal explanation. Call timer running. Recording indicator on. Everything standard.

In the background, across the room, someone’s printer started making that grinding sound like it was eating paper.

The caller said, “Don’t look at the screen like it’s going to save you.”

My fingers went cold on the mouse.

I didn’t speak for a beat. I forced my voice back into place.

“Are you in danger right now?” I asked. It’s a standard question. It’s the first step. It’s also the fastest way to find out if someone is messing with you, because prank callers don’t like being steered into anything real.

“No,” they said. “Not yet.”

“Are you thinking about harming yourself?”

A pause.

Then, softly, like they were being kind: “You are.”

My heart kicked hard once.

I almost laughed. Not because it was funny. Because it was insane. Because it was such an overreach that my brain wanted to swat it away.

“I’m not,” I said.

“You don’t have to lie,” they said. “You do that thing where you tell the truth with your body and deny it with your mouth.”

I swallowed.

“I don’t know who this is,” I said, “but if you’re calling to harass staff, I’m going to end the call.”

“Right,” they said. “That’s what you tell yourself you’ll do.”

I waited.

They continued, calm as anything.

“You’re going to hover over the end button,” they said. “Your hand’s going to shake a little, but you’re going to keep your voice steady because you like being the steady one.”

My hand was already hovering over the end button.

I pulled it back like it burned.

Across the room, the printer jammed fully and made a loud thunk. Someone muttered under their breath.

The caller said, “There it is.”

I felt my face go hot. My ears started ringing. I stared straight ahead and forced my breathing to slow down, because that’s what you do when you can’t afford to fall apart.

“This is a crisis line,” I said, careful. “If you need support, I can help you. But I need you to tell me what’s going on for you tonight.”

“You’re still performing,” they said. “You’re still trying to turn this into a normal call.”

“It is a normal call,” I said, and hated how thin my voice sounded.

The caller sighed, like they were disappointed in me.

“Okay,” they said. “Let’s do it your way. Let’s do the questions.”

Then they changed their tone slightly, like they were reading from a screen.

“Client reports increased anxiety,” they said. “Client endorses intrusive thoughts. Client presents with guarded affect. Client expresses fear of saying too much.”

My skin crawled.

That wasn’t just clinical language.

That was my language.

That was how I write.

The caller said, “You’re going to write this down. You always do.”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

They kept going.

“Denies intent. Denies plan,” they said. “States: ‘I’m not afraid of dying. I’m afraid of being kept alive for it.’”

My stomach dropped through the floor.

Because I had thought that sentence once, in my car, with the windows up, when I didn’t trust myself enough to say it out loud.

I hadn’t told a friend. I hadn’t told a therapist. I hadn’t written it in a note.

I had just thought it.

The caller’s voice softened.

“I’m calling ahead,” they said again. “I’m trying to help you stay in the script. Because if you go off-script tonight, they’re going to make it official.”

I finally found my voice.

“Who are you?” I asked.

A pause.

Then they said, almost gently, “You already know. You just don’t want to.”

And then, in the most normal tone in the world, like it was a routine part of the job, they asked:

“Are you safe right now, Joe?”

I didn’t answer right away.

Not because I didn’t have an answer.

Because the second you answer that question, you’re not just on a call anymore. You’re in a process. A fork in the road. Something that gets written down.

The caller waited. Patient. Like they already knew what I’d say and they were just letting me arrive at it on my own.

My mouth felt dry.

“I’m safe,” I said.

The caller hummed, like they were considering that. Like it was a weak argument.

“That’s the polite answer,” they said. “That’s the one you say because you like being the steady one.”

My hand went to the keyboard without me deciding to. I clicked the little internal chat window we use to flag weird calls to the floor lead.

It was greyed out.

Not “offline”. Not “try again.”

Greyed out like it had never existed.

I blinked at it and then looked around the room.

Everyone else was still on calls. Heads down. Typing. Nodding. The soft murmur of other voices. Normal.

I tried to tell myself it was a glitch. A permissions thing. A bad update.

The caller said, “Don’t look around. They can’t help you until it’s documented.”

“What do you want?” I asked.

“Do the questions,” they said, like we were back at the beginning. “Location. Supports. Means. Timeline.”

My stomach tightened.

“I’m not doing an assessment on myself,” I said.

“You already do,” they replied. “Every night. Quietly. In your head. I’m just putting it into the system.”

The way they said *the system* made it sound like a place. Not software. Not policy. A place you can end up.

I clicked mute.

A tiny icon changed on my screen. I watched it like it was a life raft.

The caller kept talking.

“Mute doesn’t stop this,” they said. “It just stops you from feeling like you’re heard.”

I stared at the mute icon. My finger hovered over it like I could force reality back into shape by clicking harder.

“How are you doing that?” I said.

“Calling ahead,” they replied. “You’re behind. You always are.”

My heart was doing that slow, heavy thud it does when I’m trying not to show anything on my face.

“Okay,” I said, carefully. “If you’re not in danger, and you’re calling to harass me, I’m ending the call.”

There was a pause.

Then the caller said, gently, “You can try.”

My cursor drifted to the end button again.

I could feel my hand shaking now. Not a lot. Enough.

The caller said, “You’re going to justify it to yourself first. ‘This is inappropriate.’ ‘This is outside protocol.’ ‘This isn’t a real caller.’”

My jaw clenched.

“That is what it is,” I said.

“And then,” they continued, “you’ll feel that little pinch in your chest because you’ll imagine the one time you hang up on a real person. The one time you get it wrong.”

My finger stopped a millimetre above the button.

Because they were right.

That’s the cruel part of this work. You can’t fully stop caring, because caring is the whole job. But caring is also a lever people can pull.

The caller’s voice softened again.

“I’m not trying to hurt you,” they said. “I’m trying to keep you from making it worse.”

“Worse than what?” I asked.

A beat.

Then they said, “Worse than being recorded.”

I looked at the top of my screen where the recording indicator sat. A tiny red dot. A comfort, usually. Proof that things happened the way you remember. Proof that you can be defended if someone says you did something you didn’t.

The caller said, “Go ahead. Open the transcript.”

We don’t usually have transcripts. Not live. Recordings are stored. Pulled later if needed. Nobody is out here making realtime subtitles of pain.

But there was a new tab.

I didn’t click it at first because I didn’t want it to be real.

Then my hand moved anyway.

A pane opened on the right side of my screen.

CALL TRANSCRIPT.

My name was already at the top as the responder.

Under it, in neat little time stamps, was everything that had been said so far.

Including things I hadn’t said out loud.

**\[00:04:12\] RESPONDER:** (thinks) *Don’t mess this up.*

My throat closed.

I scrolled.

**\[00:04:37\] RESPONDER:** (thinks) *If I hang up and he’s real, I’ll never forgive myself.*

I felt like I’d been caught naked in public.

The caller said, “There you go. Honest.”

I looked up from the transcript and realized something else.

The caller wasn’t labeled as CALLER.

The caller was labeled as RESPONDER too.

My hands went numb.

“That’s wrong,” I said.

“Is it?” the caller asked. “Read it.”

I read the line where they’d said my name.

It was tagged:

**RESPONDER.**

The line where they’d said *I’m calling ahead.*

**RESPONDER.**

The line where they’d said *You are.*

**RESPONDER.**

It was all coming from me, according to the system.

I backed out of the transcript like closing it would undo it.

The caller said, “You can’t close it now. It’s already saved.”

Across the room, someone laughed quietly at something their caller said. A normal human laugh in a normal human room.

I felt insane in the most clinical way. Like if someone walked up behind me right now and asked how my shift was going, I could answer politely and not show any of this on my face.

That’s the scariest kind of panic. The kind that looks functional.

I tried the transfer button.

It let me click. It made the sound. It brought up the list.

When I selected “Floor Lead”, it didn’t route.

It sent me back to myself.

My own greeting played in my ear.

“Thank you for calling,” my recorded voice said. “You’ve reached the crisis line. My name is Joe. What’s going on tonight?”

I pulled the headset off one ear like I could outrun audio.

The caller said, “There it is. Looping. You always loop when you’re scared.”

I looked down at my screen again.

A new notification had appeared in the corner. Bright little box. System tone.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEW INITIATED**

My stomach dropped.

I clicked it.

A form opened.

INCIDENT REPORT.

The fields were already filled out.

Not generic. Not blank.

Filled out in my cadence. My phrasing. My punctuation. The way I write when I’m trying to sound neutral and I’m actually trying to survive.

**Incident Type:** Staff safety concern  
**Description:** Responder presented with guarded affect and incongruent calm. Responder denied intent/plan but endorsed intrusive thoughts and fear of “making it official.” Responder demonstrated impaired use of supports (failed to access floor lead), repeated checking behaviors, and dissociative features (reported “looping” and transcript anomalies).  
**Interventions:** Responder prompted to follow protocol. Responder resisted. Responder continued to perform.  
**Recommendation:** Immediate supervisor consult. Remove from line. Do not leave alone.

I stared at the last line.

Do not leave alone.

The caller’s voice was quiet now. Almost kind.

“I’m calling ahead,” they said again. “Because you’re about to do what you always do.”

“What?” I whispered.

“Try to handle it yourself,” they said. “Try to stay calm. Try to look normal. Try to not be a problem.”

My hands were shaking hard enough now that I had to put them flat on the desk to stop them.

I glanced up.

My supervisor was standing across the room.

I hadn’t seen her walk out.

She wasn’t rushing. She wasn’t panicked.

She was just looking at me like she’d been expecting this tab to open all night.

And in my headset, my own voice played again, crisp and professional, like a recording from a training module.

“Are you safe right now, Joe?”

I didn’t answer. I just sat there with my hands flat on the desk like I was trying to hold myself in place.

My supervisor leaned in close enough that I could smell her coffee and said, quietly, like she was trying not to disturb the room, “Okay. We’re going to log you out now.”

My screen refreshed on its own. The incident report timestamp updated. The status changed from **DRAFT** to **SUBMITTED**.

i’d really like to stay for about a week or a bit more, and keep it under like 1.5k in costs, but the lower the better as i’m broke 😂 i’m looking for all sorts of advice on safety measures as i’m a solo female (and how safe different areas are), navigating an airport, anything i should buy/have on hand, where i should stay, activities,traveling to paris, taking the train/transportation in general, and really anything you can think of! as much or as little as you’d like to share is totally fine. thanks so much for helping me out, i’m nervous and want to be as prepared as possible :)

my interests/things to keep in mind: 

\-love music, movies, books, coffee, tea, pasta, photography, antiques, perfume, journaling, anything that is slightly reminiscent of period pieces or pride and prejudice, hiking, etc. 

\-i don’t love huge crowds, like i know london is a big city of course but i’m not too worried about attending stereotypical tourist spots like the eiffel tower or notre dame, not because they aren’t cool but i know the experience would be less enjoyable for me because of the stress of navigating a tourist spot, if that makes sense? if it’s something particularly interesting or cool to me i would brave the crowd of course. 

\-i’m currently trying to upscale my wardrobe a bit with more high quality items and procuring them slowly, rather than buying new cheap things every year. i don’t want designer, but i’m also trying to stop buying things made of polyester that will break in a year. any good clothing stores that house cozy and classy clothes that are good quality but not designer would be appreciated :) (for example: i really want this sweater from sezane, it’s baby alpaca which is a cashmere dupe and it’s 170. i would love to come back with 1-2 staple pieces like that!)

My natural hair is around a level 5. He ended up lightening my entire head and dyed it to a level 7.0 instead of doing balayage. It turned extremely orange, especially against my skin tone. There was zero dimension at all.

I cried so much that he tried to “fix” it the next day by doing a root melt and toning with 7.1 + gloss. It looked passable for about a week, but then the orange warmth came right back.

I specifically told him I’m leaving soon for an exchange program and won’t have access to a professional hairdresser while abroad, and now I’m stuck with uneven dark roots and brassy orange mid-lengths. Multiple colorists I consulted afterwards told me the only fix is to go darker, which feels like such a waste because my hair got damaged from lightening for absolutely nothing.

I never even got to enjoy the process or the color, and looking in the mirror now really depresses me.

1pqw19w,https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1pqw19w/i_read_snow_at_ninety_degrees/,I Read Snow at Ninety Degrees,"While you’re up there in winter, coats on your backs, fireplaces going, hot coffee in your hands, windows fogged over, down here in Brazil the world just melts. That’s not a figure of speech. It’s a hellfire kind of heat, the sort that could fry an egg on the asphalt without asking permission, the sort that softens your thinking and makes cathedrals sweat. Ninety degrees in the shade. Dead air. The sun coming down like a hammer.

I was sitting in a chair on the porch, trying not to think too hard about anything, listening to a book on my phone.

I’m blind. I say that up front because it changes everything.

I read with my ears. In this case, with eSpeak TTS, a text-to-speech engine famous for one thing: it doesn’t try to sound human. There’s no emotion there. No interpretation. It’s a machine reading digital text in the rawest way possible, hard syllables, merciless rhythm, zero artistic intent. To make matters worse, or stranger, I listen fast. Very fast. Somewhere around six hundred words a minute. There’s no room for savoring. Only forward motion.

The book was Doctor Zhivago.

I have never seen snow. Not ever. No childhood image tucked away somewhere, no old movie lodged in memory, no visual reference to borrow from. Snow, to me, has always been a printed word, a foreign concept, the kind of thing that belongs in thick novels and far-off countries.

And yet, at some point in the reading, I felt cold.

It was a short, involuntary shiver, the kind your body makes before your mind has time to catch up and argue. Real cold. Displaced cold. An absurd kind of cold in that end-of-the-world heat. Nothing around me had changed. The porch was the same. The sun was still doing its obscene work. The eSpeak voice stayed metallic and indifferent.

But for a few minutes, I wasn’t in Brazil anymore.

I was in the Soviet Union.

Not seeing landscapes. Not building pictures. It was something else entirely: vastness, heavy silence, ordinary lives crushed under History, the steady feeling that everything is bigger than any one person. Pasternak doesn’t just describe a place, he imposes a condition. And that condition settled into me like weather.

My chest tightened. My throat closed up. I cried. Not pretty. Not theatrical. Short, dry crying, almost embarrassed by itself.

There was no music helping along. No human voice guiding the emotion. No dramatic pauses. Just a machine dumping words at a barely civilized speed.

I forgot where I was. I lived in the Soviet Union for a moment.

Then it was over. Everything came back at once: brutal heat. Wrong country. Wrong voice. Wrong speed.

Brazil returned with its noise, its sweaty slowness, its lack of subtlety. The Soviet Union folded itself back into the book. Lara stayed somewhere that doesn’t exist anymore.

Sorry, this will probably be long but I feel some relevant back story is needed for context. We need advice, guidance, solidarity.... I don't know. It's a new situation I've found myself in that's similar but different to the history of NPD I've known from my own NM. With Xmas a few days away, it can either kick off again, or rug sweep, or whatever other way and I need to know my / our new boundaries is right. 


Usually I read and lurk. It's helped immensely over the years. But a recent situation with the in laws has me and husband (HB) wondering wtf. I need advice, or just to know I'm not going crazy seeing way too much into this. On mobile and due to lack of making my own posts, apologies if the format goes wrong. If so will try to fix it. 


My mother is uNPD, and around 10-12 years ago it was suggested BPD (more histonic). My grandmother seems along those lines. I've been NC with her for around 5 years and NC with NM for 3 years now. Middle sibling is NC with NM too for several years, youngest is low contact. We seem the rarer kind of just ignored of NC. There's no chasing, no forced monkeys, nothing. 



The players who I'll keep vague-ish are myself (hitting 40). Husband (HB, late 30s, got together 15 yrs ish, married 13, separated but cohabiting since beginning of year). I have my eldest, now adult, then together there is two under five (Little 1 and Little 2). 
There's his parents, FIL and MIL (early 60s) separated well over 20 years but very close, daily talks, frequent holidays, visits etc. SIL 1 is couple years older than HB. Has a near adult child. SIL 2 adult, 10-15 yrs junior from MIL second / current marriage. 


Before we got together he'd only ever see MIL at Xmas or if they did a family occasion. After we lived together and before we had Littles, MIL would drive past our home to visit SIL 1 and or FIL and just not stop to say hi. We lived several streets away from both, in the middle of their homes. Didn't bother him but he said he was used to it. Then Little 1 came and it went from seeing the females of the family 4-6 times a year at most instead of maybe 2 times. 

Then HB changed. He started displaying behavior that reminded me of my NM. Selfishness. Always the victim. Shift blaming and gas lighting. He would instantly go into defence mode and react. By then I had already fallen pregnant with Little 2. I was still dealing with my NM at this point. I am the eldest. The therapist. The scapegoat. The one who parented my siblings and her. 

She would always drink after work (functioning alcoholic) and if there was some slight she felt then that was when the trianglation started. There was many a verbal fight between any of us where either had taken her at her word and jumped to defence. Around 7-8 years ago they agreed to ask the other/me before reacting as usually there was proof. It stopped and I never thought I'd see or be a part of triangulation again. Boy was I wrong. 

Biggest of all was just the lies. I swear she would tell herself and others something so many times, she could've passed a lie detector test about it after a week. I used to say Google it with surface stuff but unless whoever was the friend of the week said it, everyone/thing was wrong and she was right.

 It was like the veil became thinner as she aged. On the last sibling moving out with his wife and child, she ""pretended he still lived there"" for like 8 months, blanking any mention they'd moved and she now lived alone. Didn't text or call and unless she turned up at mine (always without warning and which my In Laws always said I should tell her to contact first) and they were there, she never saw them. She said she was purposefully pretending as it hurt her how her last child left. That was around 8 years ago. He dropped the rope and blocked around 6 years ago. Childhood I don't need to mention but you can guess it's similar to many here and isn't relevant. Only that she has never tried to acknowledge or contact. She has my eldest number and his older child's number, no birthday text, no Xmas text. Never anything. Just like we don't exist in her world now which I'm thankful for, now. 



With Little 1 it was baby rabies. People would take photos and then not bother. Either coming shortly visits rarely or like NM, be in the house several times and not interact with Little or eldest, instead preferring to spend hours discussing herself and whoever caused a slight now. I put up with it for my siblings. I always had. She'd leave them alone with her stressors, her big drama (which they took years to learn wasn't true or over exaggerated to be the victim. Pity/sympathy equalled attention and she lapped it up with a warped reality). But as Little 2 pregnancy was progressing it wasn't going as smoothly as it should. I was less focused and patient. Her vocal veil thinning and dropping for any sort of reaction. If she couldn't be the victim for someone else, she'd bait to be the victim of me. I continued to grey rock. 8 months pregnant being told I needed an urgent C-section and she was so focused on herself she never acknowledged or noticed I was pregnant again. 

Within the space of a week or two, days after learning and having to prepare, she ""by accident"" caused a known allergy reaction to Little 1 and then made a long explanation on where a certain SEN comes from. She didn't even bother to add the usual ""not you/him/her of course"" about eldest who has it. I just stared at her. My HB and children with the other side of the window. They didn't hear but I just looked at her and realised she isn't safe. Not for my children and not for me. Before I could say anything she said she better go, I said yea you should. The next day I texted I had too much things to focus on so was taking space from everybody including her. She tried to argue but I blocked. Siblings understood and respected. I spoke to the In Laws about it and they each agreed it was the right thing. Triangulation and being essentially bullied was not healthy and something we should let our children see. And if the veil was gone for attention, with THAT straw comment, I was done. 



Little 2 born. (All healthy and fine now). HB gets worse. SiL 1 keeps saying I should be open and honest with her about it. So beginning of 2024 I do, I text somewhat frequently and at times she speaks with him. He starts therapy. We all try to find the cause in this switch. He would see it afterwards but just react the moment anything would push him into defence mode. I told him I wouldn't have it around the children so he needed to figure out where and why this was coming from as it was only towards me.

 A few times, someone else would offer to come or meet up, and it got to the point he'd say *I* would be uncomfortable with it, or I wouldn't want to etc. I was never asked and actually pushed him to go mingle with family and friends. He never had a close relationship with MIL/SIL and he certainly didn't want one now. In Laws always seemed to have the family trait of rug sweeping, avoiding conflict, etc.

On having Little 2 and this behaviour, at the end of 2023 I drop the rope of taking his responsibilities re In Laws. Birthdays, Xmas, etc I now had two littles with health needs, my own auto immune condition flared (we now know a second started). I wouldnt chase contact. I wouldn't be the responsible one for his side for it. I wouldnt buy and make hampers and go buy and drop off cakes. If I'm picking up his slack at home he could deal with his own family. I didn't have capacity to. I'd still be me and interact, attend, talk but my mental load was full. I had just gone no contact with NM and needed to deal. He was fine with this and of course meant it never happened lol. 


End of 2024 MIL came for a chat we requested, which I think was the total of third and last visit for 2024. All three sat and I went through his behavior he had already told her. I asked if there was signs of some kind of neurodivergence as a child, maybe that's something we can look into. I wanted to talk to her as I did not accept this behaviour for myself especially in front of my children, we both wanted to see if there was a reason why. Yes some looked like NM sliver but my ND eldest can come across the same and maybe the responsibility of having to grow up now he had two littles kids meant the masking stopped? I just wanted to see if this was a life thing or a recent thing. 

She said no nothing, he was just like her, crap with money, hates feeling bad. (Side info, late 2018 me and HB had a tragic situation out of our control.) Then she said that where I had a trauma childhood (she doesn't know the half of it so wtf), I have a ""thicker skin"" whereas HB didn't so the 2018 event was harder on him, he didn't get enough help (neither did really) and when Little 2 was born it set it off. I just said ""right."". She would always excuse it so just accepted and stopped. He scrolled the whole time two feet away. We had a discussion after how the whole purpose was to talk to his mum and he didn't bother. That id tried.  It started before Little 2, they knew this. I was upset as he let her use that as an excuse and not take accountability or remind her it started before. He didn't want to upset her to her face. So he let her. I said he needed to get more therapy and as far as I was concerned I wanted to separate. 

I later found out in a conversation about a visit he said I'd be uncomfortable due to her comment of excusing his behaviour what happened to us in 2018. That caused an argument. He said he didn't understand why he said it as he knew it wasn't true and would tell MIL this.

Another time she randomly rang to stop by on the way to a day trip her and FIL were going. Instead of saying ""we were just about to bathe them and then pop out"" as was the case, he said they can't as it would make *me* feel uncomfortable. I overheard. When he hung up he was upset. I said why lie, he said he doesn't want to upset her. I said but you did but ""threw me to the wolves"" when I did and said nothing. Again. He apologised and said he doesn't know why. 



New years I found the truth. For many years he had an online addiction that escalated to dating sites. I told him I knew. I didn't cry, even now. The dates on visits after it escalated matched to events of behaviour. And it started before 2018 so that as I thought, it all had *nothing* to do with it. We talked. Alot. He said he felt shame. I said he knew this all along and hadn't been honest with anyone, not me, them or therapists. How did he expect to address something he hid? He signed up for specific therapy. I told SIL 1 with proof. I told her she deserved to know as did his mother. That I told him he should meet them for coffee as to allow them to believe excuses when he knew the truth, wasn't fair and the first step in any progress is being honest and taking accountability. I told her I had left the ""family chat"" as I had already withdrawn socially the past year due to everything and now we were separated, he needed to explain things. Not me feeling uncomfortable when I'm asked if I'm good and I say no. I won't and can't pretend. He can explain why we are separated now if anyone asks, his family, his responsibility. Like me with mine. She said she understood. That was Jan 2025. 

I had slowed contact with SIL mid 2024 and stopped end 2024, it felt like she would wave her finger and tut to the behaviour and or him but nothing actually meaningful. There was no coffee meets, no visits, no help with talking to either really, very surface level. In Feb 2014 Little 1 needed urgent medical so she came at 10pm to sit with other so we could take her in until 6am I think. I don't think we actually saw her at all for 2024 after that. 

Noone wanted to visit despite many offers, none wanted to actually do as they said they would by being closer to him. So after Jan 2025 I just haven't reached out to any of them. I told him he needed to meet them and be honest but I was done. 

With MIL, he and I had noticed a switch the year or two previous towards me in hindsight. On the odd occasion his mum would visit, I'd start talking and she would just turn to him and start a different conversation. The offers? Still happened and then no follow up, and when he said it upset him, she'd say she understands and she means it this time. Nope. So in Jan I told him it's fine. I'll still do my ""monkey dance"" as I called it.of being polite and interact but I'm using my energy on my kids and bettering my health (which the last 12-18months has physically nosedived). I don't need to chase a second family when I'm the only one not excusing his behaviour, hoping for change that we hadn't had from them in 15 years. In calls to arrange MIL would again bring up whether I'd be comfortable with her coming and every time he'd say he has already explained many times she did not make me uncomfortable, I had no problem with any of them nor anyone coming, I've always encouraged it due to lack of grandparents my side. (I would bite my tongue if/when something happens/said or the huge difference in treatment to him and.just smile and surface level. With the switch with FIL this year I act normal and try to interact as normal but I've emotionally distanced and try to give physical space when he surprise visits in case he's waiting to talk to HB). 

He said he understands and agrees to try to meet his mum for coffee, as he agrees anything like that should not be round Littles. 

Feb 2025 he met MIL. After he told her what he had been doing that was causing the behaviour (he said he got to dating sites before she got too upset), she said SIL already told her. She praises his honesty and she wants to be a bigger part of his life and to help. She asked if I was still uncomfortable with the excuse she gave for him Nov 2024. He said he told her several times before then she didn't, explained I was upset with him when especially now it's proven it had nothing to do with it. He told.me he had to say a couple of times I have never and don't hold ill will towards her and reiterated how it was him that caused it by feeling on the spot, worried about upsetting her so used me as the excuse and he apologised again, asking if she finally understands and will stop asking. She says yes. He said if at any point she wants to talk to me about it, the separation, etc then not around the kids. It has to be when the kids are not around so if we went for coffee or something. She said she understands and agrees that's best for them. (Remember this part).

Weeks later we were told that after that coffee meet, days later she had to be rushed to hospital as she thought she was having a heart attack. Bad knees (hence excitable big dogs not good). She doesn't like to drive past lunchtime as it gets busy hence any visits were always mid morning and short and needed to be planned. (Works shifts and travels ok for that). ""Wears her heart on her sleeve"" emotional person. They didn't need to use the words he caused it for it be felt that. It turned out to be her anxiety. He told me how she's always been overly emotional and that's why no one ever wants to upset her for her reaction - I actually said he needs to sit and think of who that reminds him of. Maybe that was an angle to bring up in therapy as a learnt technique to avoid confrontation and accountability. He fully agreed it was possible.

Since then we have had at least 5-6 occasions, as per normal since the littles came, where MIL arranged to visit and then cancels within 24 hrs of coming. The last few she didn't even bother with the excuse to say she was having ""sniffles"" and if he asked if she's ok and she just said yes but plans have changed, last attempt in August. That point he said he can't be bothered with chasing the same treatment of him, me and the kids. 

Side note - For years when she would come or when he would speak to SIL or MIL, or we met at Xmas,  a day out, a visit, a meet was offered for largely me but sometimes all of us to join. He / I agreed it would be fun. He'd then see on social media it went ahead without us/me. It didn't bother me (remember I'm ""thick skinned"" 🙄) but it upset him. He told MIL once or twice on the next offer this but nothing changed. He never understood why not only he wasn't treated differently to siblings but me and our children too. This week,  it makes sense lol. 

FIL still dropped by randomly through out the year. Nothing was ever brought up so we assumed he probably knew but like them all just avoided it to avoid creating conflict or upset. We cohabited and yes a shoddy husband but he's a good father. The cause coming to light has meant real work started and change happens. We worked well together for over a decade and have this year focusing on kids first. This year he has learnt alot. Grown a lot. He also recognised he was acting like a mix of my own mother and his. This year has been calmer with shared goals, there's been no online searching of ego boosting validation from others (I did check randomly). With visits we appear normal. We weren't touchy before so on the outside it hasn't changed that much, but I found my strength, my voice and myself this year. So ie spoiler alert - no ""problems at home"" and certainly, none that was told or seen of to/by any In Law lol. 

But apart from a fleeting passing stop spring time, that's it for this year of me or kids seeing SIL 1 since Feb 2024, contact since Jan. That and a funeral for HB. No other contact. MIL been here once (plus last month) since Nov last year.  Last month was the first time I spoke to her since Nov 2024. He hasn't spoken to them really since Feb unless it was MIL arranging/canceling. If FIL had been told, his visits weren't any different. But both of us noticed a switch around May time. He would only talk family personal or financial with HB when I left the room or they were alone otherwise it felt very surface like I was an outsider. So we believed he had been told and I said to HB that's fine. It's ok if they don't expect us to remain open between ourselves despite the closer of his parents. We'd probably get the same from everyone as that's normal after separation. 


End August 2025 FIL comes as he received a midnight text from NM. First type of any contact to or for/against me since NC started. She said she had learnt we had had another baby (she knew three years prior, I told her and along the way, had minimal knowledge via sibling). She said I cut contact as she went on holiday (she wen on several every year so why would that matter lol). She wanted FIL to ""ask HB why she hasn't held baby. Why. "" I told him to ignore it. By that point she would've been at least 2-3 cans in and probably someone at work had a kid and she needed someone to feel sorry for her. We all three agreed we knew it was lies, exaggeration, being a victim and wanting sympathy. She was just trying to triangulate me and even HB now from his dad. I thanked him to telling us and giving us all a laugh. HB asked if she had messaged MIL too and he said as far as he knew, no. 

Now bare in mind that several times throughout the year, every year, he sends everyone his shift pattern. 

*Beginning of the End*
End October MIL and FIL suddenly turns up to bring Little 1 gifts. I had the dogs in the utility, all the toys and lounge stuff in the kitchen and the lounge floor pulled up, half way through laying the underlay. Dogs start going mad (young and excitable), Little 1 does the normal shy hide and quiet, Little 2 goes running round the room excited. Chaos. All later heard  by HB on the doorbell camera. They say ""not a good time? Haha"" and I say no not really. I'm told they won't be long. I had to move part of the new flooring to part open the door, FIL had to squeeze through, move more to open etc all while the dogs busted into and through the kitchen, then into lounge all excited and FIL gets mad, I'm losing my shizzle trying",1,1766177335.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,0.67,False

1. Thou shalt upvote first, read later.
Skimming the title is sufficient scholarship for strong opinions.

2. Thou shalt argue with strangers at 3 a.m. For thy sleep schedule is a burnt offering to internet discourse.

3. Thou shalt post walls of text and call it “a bit of a r4n7.”. Verily, no one shall read past the second paragraph.

4. Thou shalt demand sources, then not read them. “Source?” is merely a ritual greeting.

5. Thou shalt accuse all who disagree of being bots, shills, or both. Nuance is for other websites.

6. Thou shalt repost, then deny all knowledge of the original. Time is a flat circle and so is the front page.

7. Thou shalt treat karma as meaningless, except when boasting.
It is both “just internet points” and also thy entire personality.

8. Thou shalt mock influencers while secretly wanting their sponsorship deals.
Hypocrisy is the true cross-platform feature.

9. Thou shalt DM mods as if they are customer support. And be shocked when they are also gremlins in pajamas.

10. Thou shalt never touch grass without posting about touching grass. For if it is not upvoted, did it truly occur.


** Facebook **

1. Thou shalt overshare thy personal life to distant acquaintances. High school lab partners must know about thy gallbladder surgery.

2. Thou shalt post once yearly, yet judge all daily posters. Inactivity is the highest form of dignity.

3. Thou shalt argue in the comments of a minion meme. Political philosophy belongs beneath low-resolution clip art.

4. Thou shalt RSVP “Interested” to all events and attend none. Commitment is symbolic, like engagement rings in messenger.

5. Thou shalt tag twelve people in a post no one wanted. “This reminded me of you” is both threat and omen.

6. Thou shalt join groups and mute them instantly. Community without interaction is the modern ideal.

7. Thou shalt share articles thou only read the headline of. Critical thinking dies in the preview text.

8. Thou shalt upload 97 photos of one evening out. For a single drink requires documentary coverage.

9. Thou shalt stalk exes discreetly and then accidentally like a 2014 photo. This is the digital equivalent of tripping in public.

1. Thou shalt live thy life primarily for the photo. Experience is but the loading screen for content.

2. Thou shalt not post without editing thy face beyond human biology. Pores are a pre-2015 technology.

3. Thou shalt write “no filter” on heavily edited photos.
Honesty, but make it performative.

4. Thou shalt humblebrag in the caption. “Can’t believe this is my life” is the new victory parade.

5. Thou shalt post stories of every meal. Nutrition is measured in views and reaction emojis.

6. Thou shalt save candid photos for precisely scheduled uploads. Spontaneity must be carefully planned.

7. Thou shalt follow, mute, and never unfollow. Social politics require silent, private loathing.

8. Thou shalt treat the grid as sacred architecture. Symmetry is more important than emotional stability.

9. Thou shalt buy things thou didst not know existed 30 seconds ago.
The shop tab is thy shepherd; thou shalt not want, yet thou shalt purchase.

10. Thou shalt measure self-worth in likes, then claim not to care.
Enlightenment is reached at precisely 10k followers.

** X / Twitter **

1. Thou shalt form immediate opinions on events thou barely understand. Research is for the second draft that never comes.

2. Thou shalt tweet into the void and still fear cancellation. Obscurity and paranoia walk hand in hand.

3. Thou shalt treat every typo as a personal tragedy. There is no edit button in the valley of regret.

4. Thou shalt retweet articles thou hast not opened. Headlines are the new scripture.

5. Thou shalt mistake outrage for relevance. Anger is the algorithm’s chosen incense.

6. Thou shalt subtweet instead of communicating directly.
Passive aggression is the official language.

7. Thou shalt go viral once and spend years chasing that high. All subsequent tweets shall be pale imitations.

8. Thou shalt block liberally and mute enthusiastically. Curating reality is the only self-care policy.

9. Thou shalt treat 240 characters as a peer‑reviewed journal. Footnotes are replaced by vibes.

10. Thou shalt never log off, only briefly close the app in despair.
The timeline is eternal; thou art the battery.

5. Thou shalt treat every niche as a lifestyle. Cottagecore today, corporate goth tomorrow.

6. Thou shalt participate in trends exactly three weeks late. True authenticity means permanent mild lateness.

7. Thou shalt film strangers in public “for content.” Privacy is a vintage concept.

8. Thou shalt share productivity hacks instead of doing any work. Efficiency is best enjoyed hypothetically.

9. Thou shalt believe thou art shadowbanned whenever views are low. It is never the content; it is always the conspiracy.

10. Thou shalt vow to close the app after “one last video.” And awaken two hours later a changed, yet unchanged, person.

** LinkedIn **

1. Thou shalt disguise bragging as gratitude. “Honoured and humbled to announce” is the official prayer.

2. Thou shalt call all coworkers “incredible humans.” Even Kevin from accounts, who microwaves fish.

3. Thou shalt treat endorsements as currency. Verily, “Public Speaking” from a cousin is legal tender.

4. Thou shalt write posts longer than classic literature. Every minor workplace incident requires a 14-paragraph “leadership reflection.”

5. Thou shalt add “storyteller” to thy job title. Updating spreadsheets is now “narrative-driven data curation.”

6. Thou shalt celebrate work anniversaries thou didst not remember. “Four incredible years” of staring at the same email client.

7. Thou shalt message strangers with networking requests at dawn. Cold outreach is the new good morning.

8. Thou shalt react to posts with profound emojis instead of raises.
Applause icons are cheaper than pay rises.

9. Thou shalt speak only in buzzwords and frameworks. Synergy, alignment, and impact shall flow like lukewarm coffee.

10. ⁰Thou shalt never log out, only “open to opportunities.” Eternal job-hunting is the modern afterlife.

_Far-Future Era. Day 21, AJR._

Another day passed in realspace time. The galaxy was changing rapidly, and many events had been playing out across countless worlds.

The Wordsmiths were both dead, Maiura had fallen to the Plague, and Tarus II was destroyed by the Volgrim in a last-ditch attempt to finally eliminate the human threat once and for all. This had left humanity badly weakened and on the brink of destruction.

The Volgrim had lost 95% of their Psions to the machinations of Creator Demila and Demon Deity Mephisto, reducing their war strength to a fraction of what it once was.

The Kolvaxians were revealed to not be a hivemind of unknown origins, but the deliberate creation of Archangel Uzziel as part of her revenge against the demons, Volgrim, and humans.

Emperor Crow had attacked Cassiel and Soleil, ultimately killing the latter before being mercilessly slaughtered by Demon Emperor Gressil. His ploy removed Cassiel's protective detail and brought her to the edge of despair.

On top of everything else, Uriel had been separated from Barbatos's body, but she, Michael, and Gabriel had formed a united front against Raphael and Uzziel, allowing Barbatos to escape and report everything he had seen to the demons, as well as the rest of the galaxy.

So much had happened. So many events had played out that the formerly static and barely changing galactic playing board of the Milky Way from less than a decade earlier had been completely upended. Now, multiple factions were frantically racing to try and pick the pieces back up, conquer new territory, prevent expansion into their existing territory, and simply defend whatever scraps they could.

The galactic situation was not looking good for many disparate species across the Milky Way. The Kolvaxians were united under one ruler. They were numerous and powerful, with no apparent weaknesses. They could traverse the Void at great speeds and infest distant worlds in secret through a method nobody had properly deduced.

On top of all that, the Kolvaxians had gained two immense power-ups in the fact that Artoria's biological essence had raised every Kolvaxian's physical durability to the level of a Middle Cosmic, and that Raphael was now acting as a strategist for the hive itself.

But despite all of this, the slumbering giant known as the combined power of all Sentients across the galaxy... _had not yet given up._

There was still a fight to be had. Humanity would not bow, and they had made a decision that would set them on the path of leading the other species, despite seemingly being 'weak' and 'useless' without their Wordsmiths...

...................................

_The world of Pixiv. Humanity's Sole Settlement: Neil City._

""Less than a day, people!"" General Chadwick shouted. ""Pack only the essentials. Don't worry about food, or water. Only bring along weapons and technology!""

Men and women, soldiers and civilians, children and adults. All the humans on Pixiv hurried to and fro, racing to grab every last item they could, focusing their efforts on bringing along as much wartime munitions, weapons, and armor as possible.

Nobody smiled. Nobody laughed. A pallor of fear and desperation hung in the air. But mixed with the negativity, there was also a grim determination.

Humanity had originally planned to live on Sharmur and Pixiv, separate from one another. Many humans still believed in human supremacy, especially those among Jepthath's Legion. They did not want to fight or live alongside demons. As such, they had moved to the Fairy homeworld, intending to make a new life there.

But now, barely three weeks after being uprooted from Maiura, they were once again moving their belongings, a sense of despair in their hearts.

How many times would they become refugees? How many more times would they have to uproot their lives as if tearing hair from a scalp?

The common people didn't know what was going on. Their leaders assured them this was a good thing, and their lives were about to improve, but nobody truly believed this to be the case.

Even though the humans were transferring to Sharmur, the fairies were not. In fact, the fairies insisted on remaining behind, even after Commander Chadwick privately briefed Fairy Queen Calanthra on the new plan. He thought it was obvious the fairies would be better off taking up refuge inside the Cube.

Instead, Calanthra had merely smiled and told them to take the humans away. If the Cube could come to swallow up Pixiv directly, then that would be acceptable, but under no circumstances would she allow the fairies to abandon Pixiv to the Plague. As for her reasons why, she would not say, leaving some among the human leadership to wonder...

General Chadwick marched around the Warpgate, barking orders at various groups of personnel. He told them which boxes of goods to take first and which to save for the last day. Eventually, he stopped for a short coffee break, and to speak with someone important.

""Henry!"" Chadwick shouted, causing the young man to turn and look at him. The two men stood inside a tent less then 500 meters from the Warpgate. ""What has she decided?""

Henry nodded. He walked toward a table in the center of the tent, where a starmap of the Milky Way was laid out.

""This is the Southern Sector."" Henry said, marking out the bottom 'quarter' of the Milky Way. ""You can see the Plague-controlled worlds encroaching on the east and west edges here and here. There are thirty Plague-controlled worlds inside the Southern Sector's borders located here, here, and here. Maiura is one of them.""

He drew several lines between various dots on the map. It was a map the Volgrim had given humanity, one which positioned the galaxy in a semi-flat way, with a chosen cardinal direction to be the Galactic North. As the galaxy rotated, the stars stayed in vaguely the same relative positions, but the universe outside would also rotate, so there was a Galactic North for mapping the interior of the Milky Way, and a Universal North that always pointed toward the origin point of the universe. These two Norths were completely different from one another.

The northern, eastern, and western sectors of the Milky Way were almost entirely controlled by the Kolvaxians. These days, aside from a few scattered worlds barely within the southernmost edges of the East Sector and West Sector, the Volgrim had fully fallen back to the Southern Sector, and the Plague were already starting to nibble at the Southern Sector. With the loss of the Psions, the Southern Sector's fate was looking increasingly dire.

""This is where the ruins of Ancient Earth are located, roughly 26,000 lightyears (ly) from the galactic center, near the end of this spiral arm. And this star here? That's Sharmur, roughly 9,500ly west of Earth.""

""This is Pixiv. You can see it's about 2,300ly northwest of Sharmur. In galactic terms, a stone's throw. Look over here. The Tarus system is 7,200ly east of Sharmur, and Hell Harbor is another 9,300ly east of the Tarus system. The Cube started out in Hell Harbor, and was moved west by Jason until it came to a rest in the Tarus system, where it remained until the planet's destruction. It can travel roughly 1,500ly per day at max speed, so to get it from the Tarus system to the Sharmur system would require...""

""A little less than five days."" Chadwick answered, doing quick calculations in his head. ""It's been eighteen days since the Cube departed, so it should have already arrived inside the Sharmur system...""

Henry shook his head. ""Not quite. The Cube's travel speed is quite fast at max speed, even compared to Volgrim starships, but much slower than High Psions who specialize in Spatial Psionics. At Warp 8.0, a Volgrim starship would take just over a week to travel the 7,200 lightyears between Tarus II and Sharmur, or it would take a little more than three days at Warp 8.1. Thus, we can say the Cube is capable of traveling at top speeds between Warp 8.0 and 8.1.""

He continued. ""The problem is, to maintain secrecy, the Cube had to take a more roundabout route, making it move at a speed comparable to Warp 7.5. Still, it will arrive within the next twelve hours, thus the difference isn't too large.""

Henry pointed at Sharmur with his left index finger, and the destroyed Tarus system with his right index finger.

""The Cube does not strictly travel at any level of Warp Speed. Instead, it travels at Lightspeed through the dimension called P-Space, where distances between stars are far, far smaller. It has to avoid the gravity well of stars, black holes, and other such stellar phenomena, so its speed isn't as constant as a Volgrim ship traveling at standard Warp Speed.""

A short moment passed as Chadwick gave Henry a long look. ""This is good to know and everything, but what does this have to do with Linda's decision?""

The greater point of their meeting was not to casually discuss interstellar distances, but to instead discuss what actions humanity should take after the Cube arrived inside the Sharmur system. Thus, Henry's expression became solemn.

""Our immediate goal is to place the entire Sharmur system inside the Cube. The problem is, we don't know whether or not this will damage Demon Deity Melody, or maybe even kill her. If all goes well, we can move the system inside the Cube and gain a Middle Cosmic powerhouse to defend the Cube. But if things go wrong, Melody will die, and humanity will lose our strongest protective talisman.""

Henry continued. ""Let's assume everything goes badly, Commander. The Cube swallows the Sharmur system and Melody suffers catastrophic damage or even dies. The decision of what to do next is easy. We will have confirmed that the Cube cannot preserve the power of Stellar Wardens, and thus we would only cause damage by trying to swallow their systems. We would move on to Pixiv, which is a short 2300 lightyears away, and within a day and a half, we would scoop up the Fairies and add them to the Cube's internal worlds. Beyond that, we would simply have to pray the Plague hadn't noticed our actions, or else adding other worlds to the Cube would become impossible.""

The two men looked at one another, giving Henry a moment to collect his thoughts. However, it was Chadwick who spoke next.

""I understand now. If the Cube can preserve Melody's power, then that would prove we could do the same for the other Stellar Wardens. Those Demon Deities would become powerful assets if we merged them into the Cube. Thus, going to Pixiv next might not be the best idea.""

Henry hesitated. ""...If the problem only involved empowering humanity and making us more fit to fight the Plague, the decision would be easy. But it isn't.""

Darkness fell over Chadwick's eyes. ""Mmm. Because of trust.""

""Because of trust."" Henry confirmed. ""Even if the Cube can preserve a Warden's power, do we really trust the Demon Deities enough to add one, two, or perhaps even more of them into the Cube? After all the things they've done? Maybe it's my inner Jepthath talking, but I don't trust those scumbags as far as I can toss them.""

""My opinions are obvious."" Chadwick said, his voice low. ""Nobody on Pixiv trusts the demons. Many people are angry they have to pack up and leave. I would prefer we just stick to the plan of adding Sharmur and Pixiv to the Cube and just leave these demons to themselves.""

""You would still have to place your trust in Melody though."" Henry pointed out.

""Of course. But I don't mind her much, and I believe she's proven her loyalties decently well. She's gone to bat for humanity several times already."" Chadwick said. ""Besides, what choice do we have? Melody and Beelzebub are our only powerful protectors. We must rely on them, at least for now.""

The young man squeezed his superior's shoulder gently. Henry sighed. ""With no Wordsmiths, we're low on options. I pray the Wordsmith's children are able to rise to the challenge. Of Hope's three children, I think Mandy has the best shot of assisting us on a strategic level. Her Runic powers are great for making powerful artifacts, weapons, and armor. Levi is a solid frontline fighter, but when the enemies are Cosmics, I don't think he'll be able to do much. Blake is young and inexperienced, but he certainly has potential.""

Chadwick touched his chin. ""What about Jason's son? Timothy? Shouldn't he be around... oh, I don't know... 16 years old by now?""

""I can't say for certain, but I think he's closer to 18 or 19 now."" Henry said. ""Jepthath doesn't have any Legionnaires inside Chrona, so we can't communicate directly with them. Our best bet is that the fairies can establish communication with Blinker, or maybe Marie Becker can get in contact with her Cybernite liason.""

""We don't even know if Timothy has powers."" Chadwick said. ""It's best not to rely on an unknown variable. We should work with what we know we have. It's entirely possible Timothy won't get any powers at all.""

A short lull in the conversation followed. Henry communication with the Legion for a minute or so, then his expression darkened.

""Something's been bothering me, Chadwick.""

Chadwick's eyebrows shot up. ""What's the matter?""

The Norwegian man's portly body shook as he noticed Henry's unease.

""Remember how Jason Hiro supposedly removed the 'flaw' from human bodies?"" Henry asked.

""Of course."" Chadwick responded. ""It's made our people able to impregnate basically any species.""

""Right... and as weird as that is, that's all we've really seen happen."" Henry pointed out. ""I thought removing the Flaw was supposed to give us Heroes galore, but so far nothing has really happened. Demons like Kiari have become impregnated by human lovers, but beyond that, not much has changed. We don't see any powerful new Heroes rising up. We don't see incredible feats happening. Everything just seems... the same.""

Chadwick stared down at the galactic map laid out on the table. His eyes bored into it with deep intent, yet his gaze was unfocused, as if he couldn't see anything in front of him in particular.

""It hasn't even been a month yet."" Chadwick concluded. ""Perhaps not enough time has passed for humans to develop any powers. Perhaps our current generation won't be able to develop any abilities, but the next one will.""

""You might be right, but the uncertainty is killing me."" Henry complained. ""We NEED champions. Now more than ever. The Archangels deceived us, and they're going to gobble up the whole galaxy if we don't fight back.""

""The situation is dire, but I do not believe it's hopeless."" Chadwick said with a knowing smile. ""We are not yet backed into a corner. If the only thing we do is place the Sharmur system inside the Cube, and even if Melody dies, I believe that as long as we hide the Cube in a corner of the galaxy and increase its time dilation, we will be able to advance rapidly. Who knows? Perhaps we may even be able to develop a single star system to the point humanity alone can fight back the Plague!""

Henry didn't seem to buy into Chadwick's argument. ""The situation _is_ 'hopeless.' Hope literally died. I don't see humanity making it another decade, let alone a hundred years.""

""Oh, ye of little faith."" The Commander said with a snort. ""Just take it from a tired old man. Humanity is not so weak that we will bow to the Plague.""

After a minute of wrapping up the discussion, Chadwick pointed at the map.

""Tell Linda my recommendation is to swallow the Sharmur system, then the Pixiv system, no matter what. As for the Demon Deities, we should only determine whether or not to swallow one or more of their systems after we have saved our closest allies first.""

""Alright."" Henry said. ""I'll pass that on to her.""

The young man turned and strode out of the tent, leaving Chadwick behind. The Norwegian man snorted derisively.

""Neil was right. We mustn't trust the demons any more than is necessary.""

...................................

_The world of Numaria, deep underground, beneath a mountain._

Barbatos's body twitched. Beside him, Emperor Belial stood, her hands placed upon his chest, pouring her feeble mortal healing energy into him. Emperor Leeroy was there as well, and the two of them worked tirelessly to do their best to heal Barbatos's grievous wounds as best as they could.

""Brother Barbatos."" Auger said, as he walked over to stand on the opposite side of the bed Barbatos had been laid upon. ""There is a matter I must consult with you about.""

Barbatos slowly opened his eyes. A deep gloominess filled his vision; the result of witnessing his brother's death, and the sadness and loneliness that came along with it. For the entire past day after crash-landing on Numaria, his mind had ached with mental pain far greater than the torture his body endured. To lose the only brother he ever had in the world, a brother who had once given his life to save Barbatos, that fact seared his soul's very foundation.

Barbatos was in more pain than anyone knew, but he never let it show.

""Speak..."" Barbatos rasped.

Auger hesitated, seeing the pain in Barbatos's eyes. But he ultimately relented. ""I have spoken to the Volgrim. They informed me of a possible way we demons might be able to stand a chance against the Plague, but... it would require the help of a High Cosmic, or even better, an Apex Cosmic.""

Barbatos slowly blinked. His eyes slid to the left to look at Auger's face. He said nothing, simply waiting for Auger's explanation.

Sensing Barbatos's intent, Auger cleared his throat, bowed his head, and serenely clasped his hands together in front of his waist.

""Unarin believes it may be possible to relocate the star systems of our Middle Cosmics. To do so would require the power of a being terrifying beyond belief. By moving not only the star itself, but also the planets, we might be able to slowly 'drag' Numaria, Hell Harbor, and other such systems together, within just a few lightyears of each other. Middle Cosmics are barely powerful enough to 'nudge' the direction of a system's natural travel orientation, but High Cosmics can exert enough power to directly pull systems in a desired direction much more quickly. Apex Cosmics would be able to do the same feat, but far faster and with less effort.""

Barbatos's eyes opened and closed, ever so slowly.

""You wish... for me... to move Numaria?""

""Not now. You are injured and weak."" Auger said, bowing his head. ""I would certainly not presume to order you around. I have spent the past 16 hours testing out the range I can project my power. I can travel up to 10 lightyears from Numaria's star before my power begins to wane. Once I travel 15 lightyears, my power starts to drop rapidly, and as such, I believe 10 lightyears is my maximum 'force projection distance.'""

Auger continued. ""I have not yet spoken to the other Deities about this, as I wanted to run it past you first. You are the strongest demon in the Milky Way, and as such, everyone is looking to you for leadership. Do you believe, once you are recovered, you will have the strength to move our star systems together? If we can position ourselves closely enough, all the Demon Deities will be able to multiply our power and cover for one another! We will be able to fight back if the Plague arrives and carve out at least one small, tiny sliver of the Milky Way as a bulwark the Archangels won't be able to penetrate!""

Auger paused.

""All of this, of course, is only possible if you are willing to assist us once you've healed. If not... I will continue to look into other alternatives.""

A long silence followed. Barbatos's eyes drifted open and closed. He stared up at the ceiling, feeling Belial and Leeroy's healing magic slowly healing his broken body, a little bit at a time.

""Very... well..."" Barbatos said quietly. ""Once I am... healed. I will try.""

Auger's gaze brightened.

""Many thanks, Barbatos. I will do everything in my power to speed up your healing.""

He bowed his head respectfully, then turned and walked away.

Now, it seemed possible that the demons had acquired an alternative method of protecting themselves...",8,1766176820.0,HFY,5,0.9,False

_Far-Future Era. Day 21, AJR._

Another day passed in realspace time. The galaxy was changing rapidly, and many events had been playing out across countless worlds.

The Wordsmiths were both dead, Maiura had fallen to the Plague, and Tarus II was destroyed by the Volgrim in a last-ditch attempt to finally eliminate the human threat once and for all. This had left humanity badly weakened and on the brink of destruction.

The Volgrim had lost 95% of their Psions to the machinations of Creator Demila and Demon Deity Mephisto, reducing their war strength to a fraction of what it once was.

...................................

_The world of Pixiv. Humanity's Sole Settlement: Neil City._

""Less than a day, people!"" General Chadwick shouted. ""Pack only the essentials. Don't worry about food, or water. Only bring along weapons and technology!""

Men and women, soldiers and civilians, children and adults. All the humans on Pixiv hurried to and fro, racing to grab every last item they could, focusing their efforts on bringing along as much wartime munitions, weapons, and armor as possible.

Nobody smiled. Nobody laughed. A pallor of fear and desperation hung in the air. But mixed with the negativity, there was also a grim determination.

Humanity had originally planned to live on Sharmur and Pixiv, separate from one another. Many humans still believed in human supremacy, especially those among Jepthath's Legion.

In fact, the fairies insisted on remaining behind, even after Commander Chadwick privately briefed Fairy Queen Calanthra on the new plan. He thought it was obvious the fairies would be better off taking up refuge inside the Cube.

Instead, Calanthra had merely smiled and told them to take the humans away. If the Cube could come to swallow up Pixiv directly, then that would be acceptable, but under no circumstances would she allow the fairies to abandon Pixiv to the Plague. As for her reasons why, she would not say, leaving some among the human leadership to wonder...

General Chadwick marched around the Warpgate, barking orders at various groups of personnel. He told them which boxes of goods to take first and which to save for the last day. Eventually, he stopped for a short coffee break, and to speak with someone important.

""Henry!"" Chadwick shouted, causing the young man to turn and look at him. The two men stood inside a tent less then 500 meters from the Warpgate. ""What has she decided?""

Henry nodded. He walked toward a table in the center of the tent, where a starmap of the Milky Way was laid out.

""This is the Southern Sector."" Henry said, marking out the bottom 'quarter' of the Milky Way. ""You can see the Plague-controlled worlds encroaching on the east and west edges here and here. There are thirty Plague-controlled worlds inside the Southern Sector's borders located here, here, and here. Maiura is one of them.""

He drew several lines between various dots on the map. It was a map the Volgrim had given humanity, one which positioned the galaxy in a semi-flat way, with a chosen cardinal direction to be the Galactic North. As the galaxy rotated, the stars stayed in vaguely the same relative positions, but the universe outside would also rotate, so there was a Galactic North for mapping the interior of the Milky Way, and a Universal North that always pointed toward the origin point of the universe.

Henry continued. ""Let's assume everything goes badly, Commander. The Cube swallows the Sharmur system and Melody suffers catastrophic damage or even dies. The decision of what to do next is easy. We will have confirmed that the Cube cannot preserve the power of Stellar Wardens, and thus we would only cause damage by trying to swallow their systems. We would move on to Pixiv, which is a short 2300 lightyears away, and within a day and a half, we would scoop up the Fairies and add them to the Cube's internal worlds. Beyond that, we would simply have to pray the Plague hadn't noticed our actions, or else adding other worlds to the Cube would become impossible.""

The two men looked at one another, giving Henry a moment to collect his thoughts. However, it was Chadwick who spoke next.

""I understand now. If the Cube can preserve Melody's power, then that would prove we could do the same for the other Stellar Wardens. Those Demon Deities would become powerful assets if we merged them into the Cube. Thus, going to Pixiv next might not be the best idea.""

Henry hesitated. ""...If the problem only involved empowering humanity and making us more fit to fight the Plague, the decision would be easy. But it isn't.""

Darkness fell over Chadwick's eyes. ""Mmm. Because of trust.""

""Because of trust."" Henry confirmed. ""Even if the Cube can preserve a Warden's power, do we really trust the Demon Deities enough to add one, two, or perhaps even more of them into the Cube? After all the things they've done? Maybe it's my inner Jepthath talking, but I don't trust those scumbags as far as I can toss them.""

""My opinions are obvious."" Chadwick said, his voice low. ""Nobody on Pixiv trusts the demons. Many people are angry they have to pack up and leave. I would prefer we just stick to the plan of adding Sharmur and Pixiv to the Cube and just leave these demons to themselves.""

""You would still have to place your trust in Melody though."" Henry pointed out.

""Of course. But I don't mind her much, and I believe she's proven her loyalties decently well. She's gone to bat for humanity several times already."" Chadwick said. ""Besides, what choice do we have? Melody and Beelzebub are our only powerful protectors. We must rely on them, at least for now.""

The young man squeezed his superior's shoulder gently. Henry sighed. ""With no Wordsmiths, we're low on options. I pray the Wordsmith's children are able to rise to the challenge. Of Hope's three children, I think Mandy has the best shot of assisting us on a strategic level. Her Runic powers are great for making powerful artifacts, weapons, and armor. Levi is a solid frontline fighter, but when the enemies are Cosmics, I don't think he'll be able to do much. Blake is young and inexperienced, but he certainly has potential.""

Chadwick touched his chin. ""What about Jason's son? Timothy? Shouldn't he be around... oh, I don't know... 16 years old by now?""

""I can't say for certain, but I think he's closer to 18 or 19 now."" Henry said. ""Jepthath doesn't have any Legionnaires inside Chrona, so we can't communicate directly with them. Our best bet is that the fairies can establish communication with Blinker, or maybe Marie Becker can get in contact with her Cybernite liason.""

""We don't even know if Timothy has powers."" Chadwick said. ""It's best not to rely on an unknown variable. We should work with what we know we have. It's entirely possible Timothy won't get any powers at all.""

A short lull in the conversation followed. Henry communication with the Legion for a minute or so, then his expression darkened.

""Something's been bothering me, Chadwick.""

Chadwick's eyebrows shot up. ""What's the matter?""

The Norwegian man's portly body shook as he noticed Henry's unease.

""Remember how Jason Hiro supposedly removed the 'flaw' from human bodies?"" Henry asked.

""Of course."" Chadwick responded. ""It's made our people able to impregnate basically any species.""

""Right... and as weird as that is, that's all we've really seen happen."" Henry pointed out. ""I thought removing the Flaw was supposed to give us Heroes galore, but so far nothing has really happened. Demons like Kiari have become impregnated by human lovers, but beyond that, not much has changed. We don't see any powerful new Heroes rising up. We don't see incredible feats happening. Everything just seems... the same.""

Chadwick stared down at the galactic map laid out on the table. His eyes bored into it with deep intent, yet his gaze was unfocused, as if he couldn't see anything in front of him in particular.

""It hasn't even been a month yet."" Chadwick concluded. ""Perhaps not enough time has passed for humans to develop any powers. Perhaps our current generation won't be able to develop any abilities, but the next one will.""

""You might be right, but the uncertainty is killing me."" Henry complained. ""We NEED champions. Now more than ever. The Archangels deceived us, and they're going to gobble up the whole galaxy if we don't fight back.""

""The situation is dire, but I do not believe it's hopeless."" Chadwick said with a knowing smile. ""We are not yet backed into a corner. If the only thing we do is place the Sharmur system inside the Cube, and even if Melody dies, I believe that as long as we hide the Cube in a corner of the galaxy and increase its time dilation, we will be able to advance rapidly. Who knows? Perhaps we may even be able to develop a single star system to the point humanity alone can fight back the Plague!""

Henry didn't seem to buy into Chadwick's argument. ""The situation _is_ 'hopeless.' Hope literally died. I don't see humanity making it another decade, let alone a hundred years.""

""Oh, ye of little faith."" The Commander said with a snort. ""Just take it from a tired old man. Humanity is not so weak that we will bow to the Plague.""

After a minute of wrapping up the discussion, Chadwick pointed at the map.

""Tell Linda my recommendation is to swallow the Sharmur system, then the Pixiv system, no matter what. As for the Demon Deities, we should only determine whether or not to swallow one or more of their systems after we have saved our closest allies first.""

""Alright."" Henry said. ""I'll pass that on to her.""

The young man turned and strode out of the tent, leaving Chadwick behind. The Norwegian man snorted derisively.

""Neil was right. We mustn't trust the demons any more than is necessary.""

...................................

_The world of Numaria, deep underground, beneath a mountain._

Barbatos's body twitched. Beside him, Emperor Belial stood, her hands placed upon his chest, pouring her feeble mortal healing energy into him. Emperor Leeroy was there as well, and the two of them worked tirelessly to do their best to heal Barbatos's grievous wounds as best as they could.

""Brother Barbatos."" Auger said, as he walked over to stand on the opposite side of the bed Barbatos had been laid upon. ""There is a matter I must consult with you about.""

Barbatos slowly opened his eyes. A deep gloominess filled his vision; the result of witnessing his brother's death, and the sadness and loneliness that came along with it. For the entire past day after crash-landing on Numaria, his mind had ached with mental pain far greater than the torture his body endured. To lose the only brother he ever had in the world, a brother who had once given his life to save Barbatos, that fact seared his soul's very foundation.

Barbatos was in more pain than anyone knew, but he never let it show.

""Speak..."" Barbatos rasped.

Auger hesitated, seeing the pain in Barbatos's eyes. But he ultimately relented. ""I have spoken to the Volgrim. They informed me of a possible way we demons might be able to stand a chance against the Plague, but... it would require the help of a High Cosmic, or even better, an Apex Cosmic.""

Barbatos slowly blinked. His eyes slid to the left to look at Auger's face. He said nothing, simply waiting for Auger's explanation.

Sensing Barbatos's intent, Auger cleared his throat, bowed his head, and serenely clasped his hands together in front of his waist.

""Unarin believes it may be possible to relocate the star systems of our Middle Cosmics. To do so would require the power of a being terrifying beyond belief. By moving not only the star itself, but also the planets, we might be able to slowly 'drag' Numaria, Hell Harbor, and other such systems together, within just a few lightyears of each other. Middle Cosmics are barely powerful enough to 'nudge' the direction of a system's natural travel orientation, but High Cosmics can exert enough power to directly pull systems in a desired direction much more quickly. Apex Cosmics would be able to do the same feat, but far faster and with less effort.""

Barbatos's eyes opened and closed, ever so slowly.

""You wish... for me... to move Numaria?""

""Not now. You are injured and weak."" Auger said, bowing his head. ""I would certainly not presume to order you around. I have spent the past 16 hours testing out the range I can project my power. I can travel up to 10 lightyears from Numaria's star before my power begins to wane. Once I travel 15 lightyears, my power starts to drop rapidly, and as such, I believe 10 lightyears is my maximum 'force projection distance.'""

Auger continued. ""I have not yet spoken to the other Deities about this, as I wanted to run it past you first. You are the strongest demon in the Milky Way, and as such, everyone is looking to you for leadership. Do you believe, once you are recovered, you will have the strength to move our star systems together? If we can position ourselves closely enough, all the Demon Deities will be able to multiply our power and cover for one another! We will be able to fight back if the Plague arrives and carve out at least one small, tiny sliver of the Milky Way as a bulwark the Archangels won't be able to penetrate!""

Auger paused.

""All of this, of course, is only possible if you are willing to assist us once you've healed. If not... I will continue to look into other alternatives.""

A long silence followed. Barbatos's eyes drifted open and closed. He stared up at the ceiling, feeling Belial and Leeroy's healing magic slowly healing his broken body, a little bit at a time.

""Very... well..."" Barbatos said quietly. ""Once I am... healed. I will try.""

Auger's gaze brightened.

""Many thanks, Barbatos. I will do everything in my power to speed up your healing.""

He bowed his head respectfully, then turned and walked away.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

1pqvpr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pqvpr6/wailing_mountain_part_1/,Wailing Mountain [Part 1],"I should probably start by saying I'm not a superstitious man. I'm a man of numbers, of spreadsheets, and the cold, hard logic of algorithms. You can call me Ben. Thirty-two years old, junior data analyst at a mid-sized firm that optimizes supply chains for a living. My world is one of quantifiable metrics, efficiency reports, and the soul-crushing glow of a monitor at 3 a.m. I believe in what can be measured, what can be tested, and what can be replicated. Ghost stories, mountain curses, folk tales of things that go bump in the night—those are the currencies of the credulous, the soft-headed, the people who buy lottery tickets with their rent money.

So when I inherited my grandfather's cabin—a place I hadn't seen since I was ten and had largely erased from my memory—I didn't see it as the acquisition of some hallowed family ground steeped in local legend. I saw it as a data point in my life's equation: a variable. An asset. A sudden, unexpected, and frankly, welcome escape hatch from the urban treadmill I'd been mindlessly jogging on for a decade. The property, nestled deep in the Appalachian wilderness of western North Carolina, was described by the lawyer in sterile, legal terms: ""a rustic dwelling on a sizable parcel of land, bequeathed by your paternal grandfather, Lazarus Blackwood, upon his passing."" The cause of death was listed as ""a long and private illness."" I remember him vaguely. A quiet, intense man with hands like gnarled oak roots and eyes that seemed to hold the shadows of the deep woods he inhabited. We never connected. My father had fled these mountains as a teenager and never looked back, marrying my mother and settling into the suburban flatlands of Ohio, where the most mysterious thing to happen was the occasional power outage during a thunderstorm. My father died when I was twelve, and it was an, albeit unwelcome, surprise to see him go long before my grandfather.

The drive up was a nauseating exercise in surrendering control. My Prius, a vessel of modern efficiency and environmental consciousness, whined in protest as the paved roads gave way to gravel, then to rutted dirt tracks that seemed designed by a vindictive deity to punish hubris. The forest pressed in on all sides, a cathedral of ancient, indifferent hardwoods. Canopy so dense it blotted out the sun, dappling the road in shifting patterns of gloom. The air changed, too. It grew thicker, heavier, saturated with the sweet, cloying scent of decay—wet leaves, rotting wood, the damp, fungal perfume of a world that lived by its own rules.

The drive up was a journey through layers of civilization peeling away. The six-lane arteries of the city thinned to four, then two. Pavement gave way to asphalt, then to a winding, potholed scar of gravel that twisted up into the mountains like a dying serpent.

I stopped at a lowly convenience store about 30 miles out to get a drink and snacks. A woman with hair the color of rust and eyes the color of moss gave me a look as I paid for my supplies. She was wearing an old, faded t-shirt that was so stained I couldn't tell what the original design was.

“You're that Blackwood boy, ain'tcha?” she asked, her voice a dry rustle.

The question hung in the air, thick and uncomfortable. I forced a smile. “Yeah, hi. Ben. Just heading up to the cabin for a bit.”

She nodded slowly, her gaze unwavering. “Be careful up there. Them mountains… they got their own ways.""

*Well*, I thought, *just kill me now*.

My GPS signal died twenty miles out, and my phone followed suit shortly after. I was officially off the grid. The final few miles were navigated by memory—or what I could dredge up of it—and the rudimentary map the lawyer had included, a hand-drawn thing my grandfather had apparently made decades ago. The cabin didn't appear so much as it resolved itself out of the mist and the towering, brooding sentinels of ancient pines. It was larger than I remembered, built from massive, dark logs that seemed to absorb the weak afternoon light. A stone chimney, patched and repatched over the years, clawed at the sky like a broken finger. There was a profound, almost suffocating silence here, a silence so dense it felt like a physical presence after the constant, subliminal hum of the city.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of pine, dust, and something else... something vaguely medicinal and metallic. Decades of my grandfather's life were layered here. Books on botany and regional folklore were crammed into makeshift shelves. Mason jars filled with unidentifiable herbs and tinctures lined a kitchen counter. Everything was solid, heavy, and functional, built to last longer than the men who made it. It was a fortress against the wilderness, and against something else, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was the kind of place that made you feel like an intruder, even if you owned the deed.

I spent the first two days in a state of blissful decompression. I unplugged. I read. I hiked a few of the trails marked on the old map, the cool mountain air a welcome balm to my city-scorched lungs. I fixed a loose shutter, chopped firewood, and generally reveled in the simple, tactile reality of it all. At night, the silence was absolute, so profound that the occasional hoot of an owl or the scuttling of some unseen thing in the walls was a startling, almost violent event. I slept like the dead, a deep, dreamless sleep I hadn't experienced since childhood. I felt, for the first time in years, genuinely restored.

I explored every corner of the cabin, trying to piece together the ghost of the man I barely knew. In a desk drawer, beneath a stack of yellowed botanical charts, I found a small, leather-bound journal. The handwriting was a cramped, precise scrawl, almost impossible to decipher. The entries were sporadic, spanning decades.

September 12th, 1978: *The graft took. The old root is holding. The land is satisfied. Must maintain the balance.*

March 3rd, 1985: *Another tremor. Tap-tap. It grows weaker. I grow stronger. The paradox is a crucible.*

June 21st, 1992: *The sickness has returned. Not to it. To me. The mountain rot takes its tithe.*

The entries were cryptic, a mix of what looked like vague agricultural notes and something far more esoteric. It read like the ravings of an eccentric old man, a folk doctor who'd spent too long talking to his plants. I dismissed it as the ramblings of a loner who'd created his own private mythology to stave off the crushing solitude. More mountain nonsense.

On the third night, it started.

I was drifting off to sleep, cocooned in the unfamiliar scratch of the wool blankets, when I heard it.

*Thump.*

A single, deep, resonant sound. I blinked my eyes open, my mind instantly cataloging possibilities. Settling. The cabin was old. Wood expands and contracts. I lay there, listening. Nothing. The silence rushed back in to fill the void. I rolled over, chalking it up to my own hypersensitivity in this new, quiet environment.

A minute later.

*Thump-thump.*

Same spot, same sound. But two in quick succession. Low, almost sub-audible, but definite. Muffled. Coming from... below me? Or maybe the walls? I just hoped to God it wasn't from outside. I sat up, straining my ears. My rational brain kicked in. Thermal contraction of the beams. A pinecone falling on the roof. The possibilities were mundane, plentiful. I told myself to relax, to get a grip. I was a grown man, not a child afraid of the dark. I lay back down, forcing myself to breathe slowly, deliberately. Sleep eventually reclaimed me, a fitful, restless sleep haunted by the echo of that sound.

The next morning, I almost convinced myself it hadn't happened. I went about with a slight undercurrent of unease, but it soon washed away at the sight of the sun-drenched valley from the porch.

On my hike that afternoon, I went deeper into the woods than before, following a deer trail that twisted through a dense stand of ancient hemlocks. The beauty was staggering, a cathedral of green and brown and dappled gold. I came across a strange symbol carved into the trunk of a massive, lightning-scarred oak. It was a crude, primitive thing: a circle with a spiral inside it, and three jagged lines radiating out from the bottom like roots. My grandfather's mark, perhaps? A boundary marker? Or just some random act of vandalism from some other, more primitive hiker.

As I continued down the trail, I noticed other things. The land on this property was unnervingly fertile, a lush, riotous green that stood in stark, almost unnatural, contrast to the thinner, paler vegetation on the neighboring properties I'd seen on the drive in. The trees here were giants, their trunks impossibly thick. There was a sense of life here that was almost aggressive, palpable. It felt... old. Primordial.

Then, I heard it.

It was not a bear, not a coyote, not a fox, not a wild boar, and not any other animal I had ever heard before. It was a low, guttural, and mournful cry, a sound that seemed to be ripped from the very earth itself. It was a sound of immense pain and loneliness, a sound that vibrated in my bones. It was the kind of sound that made the hairs on my arms stand on end, the kind of sound that made me want to turn and run. I stood frozen for a full minute, listening to the echoes die away, my heart hammering against my ribcage. It wasn't a roar or a snarl. It was a lament. And it was close.

I practically sprinted back to the cabin, the joy of my nature walk completely evaporated, replaced by a primal fear I hadn't felt since I was a child. I burst through the door, slamming it behind me and leaning against it, my chest heaving. The silence inside the cabin was suddenly menacing, not peaceful.

I spent the rest of the day inside, my mind replaying the cry, the symbol, the unnatural fecundity of the land. The rational part of my brain, the part that had served me so well for thirty-two years, was fighting a losing battle against a rising tide of irrational dread. I found myself drawn back to my grandfather's desk, to the cryptic journal. I devoured the entries again, this time not as the ramblings of an old eccentric, but as potential clues.

*The graft took. The old root is holding.*

What if ""root"" wasn't just a metaphor for a plant? What if it was something else? Something more… fundamental?

*The mountain rot takes its tithe.*

The mountain rot. I'd heard whispers of it in town. A wasting sickness that supposedly afflicted families who had lived on the land for too long, a localized curse that bled the life from them slowly, over generations. Folklore. Just folklore. But the words on the page, combined with that terrifying cry in the woods, were weaving a new, more horrifying narrative in my mind. I started tearing through the other books on the shelves, not looking for botany charts anymore, but for anything on local history, on folklore, on the ""mountain rot.""

I found a dusty, leather-bound tome titled ""The Blood of the Land: A Compendium of Appalachian Folk Practices."" The author was anonymous. The pages were filled with handwritten notes in the margins, in my grandfather's familiar, cramped scrawl. I flipped through it, my hands trembling. Most of it was the standard stuff I'd expect—cures for warts using potato peelings, charms for good weather, stories of the Cherokee Little People. But then, tucked between a passage on dowsing rods and a recipe for poultice made from ""graveyard dirt,"" was a chapter that made my heart stumble a bit.

It was titled ""The Root Graft.""

The theory was… monstrous. It posited that the land itself, particularly in these ancient, isolated mountains, was a living entity, a primordial organism. Some families, the ""First Bloods,"" who had settled and tamed the land generations ago, had developed a symbiotic relationship with it. But like any symbiosis, it had a parasitic side. The land would eventually turn on its inhabitants, draining them of their vitality. The ""mountain rot.""

It was insane. It was the stuff of cheap paperback horror novels. But my grandfather had clearly believed it.

As the fourth night fell, the cabin felt less like a sanctuary and more like a cage. I locked the door. A useless, pathetic gesture against an enemy I couldn't even name, if it wasn't just my own mind. I was wide awake, reading a worn paperback by the light of a battery-powered lantern, when it began. Not a single thump, but a steady, maddening rhythm.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump... thump-thump...*

It was a heartbeat. A slow, ponderous, impossibly deep heartbeat. Amplified. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. From the floorboards beneath my feet. From the very walls of the cabin. From the stone hearth of the fireplace. It vibrated through the bedframe, a low, resonant hum that sank into my bones. I shot up, my heart hammering in my chest in frantic, arrhythmic counterpoint to the slow, deliberate beat from below.

I got out of bed, my bare feet silent on the cold wood. I crept from room to room, a hunter stalking an unseen prey. In the kitchen, the sound was clearer, but still muffled, as if originating from deep within the earth beneath the foundation. I pressed my ear to the floor. The vibration was stronger here, a physical pressure against my eardrum. My mind raced, a frantic flurry of rationalizations. An old generator? A water pump with a failing pressure switch? A well pump, maybe? Yes, that made sense. Grandfather probably had a well. The pump must be malfunctioning, cycling on and off. A relief, a mundane explanation for a terrifying phenomenon. I could fix a pump. I could call a well service. I just needed a phone signal.

But the sound didn't stop. It continued, a relentless, metronomic pulse. A slow, steady beat that stretched into the night. I didn't sleep at all. I just sat in the worn armchair by the cold fireplace, a blanket wrapped around my shoulders, and listened as the hours bled into one another. The sun rose, a pale, anaemic disc in a sky the color of bruised plums, and the sound finally, blessedly, faded away with the last fragments of darkness. I was left hollowed out, my nerves frayed, my body aching with a fatigue that went bone-deep. The silence that returned was now a mockery, a temporary reprieve. I knew it would be back.

The next day was an exercise in psychological torment. Every creak of the floorboards was a potential prelude. Every gust of wind whistling through the eaves was a distorted echo of the rhythm. The cabin was no longer a refuge; it was a resonant chamber for a sound that was systematically dismantling my sanity. I decided to spend the day down the mountain in the small town I'd passed through. I needed supplies, yes, but more than that, I needed the noise of civilization, the anodyne clamor of traffic and people, to drown out the memory of the night's horror. I also needed to ask about a well service.

The drive down was nerve-wracking. Every shadow on the road seemed to coalesce into some new horror. The rustling leaves sounded like whispers. I was becoming one of them. One of the credulous, the soft-headed.

The town was called Harrow's Creek. It was a place that looked like it had been forgotten by progress, a cluster of dusty storefronts and faded clapboard houses clinging to the side of the mountain. I parked in front of the general store, the same one where the rust-haired woman had worked. She wasn't there today. Instead, a man with a beer gut straining against a grease-stained t-shirt was leaning against the counter, reading a dog-eared copy of Field and Stream. He looked up as I entered, his eyes a pale, washed-out blue.

""Afternoon,"" he grunted, not unfriendly.

""Afternoon,"" I replied, my own voice sounding thin and reedy. ""I was wondering if you could help me. I'm up at the old Blackwood cabin.""

His expression didn't change, but a flicker of something—recognition? apprehension?—passed through his eyes. ""The Blackwood place, eh? Your kin?""

""My grandfather's. Lazarus Blackwood.""

The man nodded slowly, a deliberate, thoughtful gesture. ""Old Lazarus. A quiet one. Knew these woods better than any man alive. Kept to himself, mostly."" He looked me up and down, a frank, appraising stare. ""You don't look like much of a woodsman.""

""I'm not,"" I admitted, a little too quickly. ""Look, the reason I came down is... the place has a well, right?""

""I'm sure it does.""

""I think the pump is acting up,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady, casual. ""It's making this... noise. A thumping. A rhythmic thumping, like... like a heartbeat."" The word slipped out before I could stop it, a crack in my carefully constructed veneer of pragmatism.

The man's face, which had been a mask of rural indifference, tightened. His eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward slightly over the counter, the springs of the old stool beneath him groaning in protest. The air in the store grew heavy, thick with unspoken things.

""Heartbeat, you say?"" he said, his voice now a low, deliberate murmur. ""How... regular is it?""

The question was so specific that I was taken aback a bit. He wasn't surprised. He wasn't trying to diagnose a faulty pressure switch. He was confirming a suspicion.

""It's... it's very regular,"" I stammered, my composure finally shattering. ""Thump-thump... thump-thump. All night long. It starts at dusk and stops at dawn. It's driving me insane.""

The man, whose name was, according to a patch on his shirt, Rocky, didn't answer right away. He stared past me, out the dusty window at the brooding green expanse of the mountains. He seemed to be wrestling with something, a decision. Finally, he let out a long, slow breath that smelled of stale coffee and regret.

""Look, son,"" he said, turning his washed-out blue eyes back to me. ""I'm not going up there. No one is.""

""What? Why? It's just a pump! I'll pay whatever it takes!"" My voice was rising, tinged with the hysteria I'd been fighting all morning.

""It ain't the pump,"" Rocky said, his tone flat, final. ""And it ain't just a noise. Some things on this mountain... they ain't meant to be messed with. Your grandfather, he understood that..."" He trailed off, shaking his head. ""You should go back to the city. Just... walk away from that place. Tear up the deed. It ain't worth it.""

""Understood what?"" I demanded, my hands clenching into fists on the counter. ""What the hell is going on up there?""

Rocky's gaze dropped to the worn countertop. ""Best you leave now,"" he mumbled, suddenly refusing to meet my eyes. ""Before it gets dark.""

A cold dread, far more profound than the fear induced by the sound, seeped into my bones. This wasn't about a faulty well pump. This was something else, something the locals knew, something they feared. It was the same look the rust-haired woman had given me, the same cryptic warnings. I'm quite the skeptic, but my brain wasn't exactly running to rationality in the moment.

""But I can't just leave,"" I pleaded, the words feeling pathetic even as I spoke them. ""It's my cabin. My inheritance.""

Rocky finally looked up, and in his eyes, I saw a flicker of something that looked an awful lot like pity. ""Son, that ain't an inheritance. It's a chain.""

With that, I left the store in a daze, my arms full of canned goods, bottled water, and a flashlight with extra batteries I'd bought on pure, primal instinct. The ""chain"" he'd spoken of felt real, a cold, heavy weight settling around my neck. I got back in my car, my mind a scattering of Rocky's words, the rhythmic thumping from the night before, and the cryptic entries in my grandfather's journal. I couldn't leave. Not yet. My own brand of stubbornness, a trait I must have inherited from the very man who'd left me this nightmare, refused to let me flee with my tail between my legs. I had to understand. I had to know.

I drove back up the mountain, the setting sun casting long, monstrous shadows across the road. The cabin, when I reached it, was a dark, hulking silhouette against a sky bleeding from orange to a deep, bruised purple. The silence was already waiting for me, a coiled serpent ready to strike. I unloaded my supplies, my movements quick and jerky, my head swiveling at every rustle of leaves. I locked the door behind me, the deadbolt sliding into place with a sound that was both comforting and utterly futile.

I ate a cold dinner of canned beans, my appetite gone, the food tasting like ash in my mouth. I barricaded myself in the main room, piling a heavy armchair and a small oak table against the door, a pathetic little fort against the unknown. The last rays of light faded, and the cabin was plunged into a profound darkness, broken only by the weak, yellow beam of my flashlight.

I didn't have to wait long.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump... thump-thump...*

It started right on cue, as the last vestiges of twilight surrendered to the night. The sound was different tonight. Clearer. More insistent. It was no longer just a sound; it was a presence. It felt personal, directed. It was the sound of a malevolent intelligence, a slow, deliberate mockery of life itself. I could feel it in the floorboards, in the air I breathed, in the fillings of my teeth. My own heart was a frantic, trapped bird fluttering against my ribs, a panicked counterpoint to the slow, steady pulse from below.

I looked around for any well or pump, any source, but I couldn't find anything. It was like the sound was coming from the very dirt under the cabin. The floorboards were old, but they were solid. I decided to pull up a small area rug to see if I could find a hatch or a trapdoor. Nothing. Just a dark, stained wooden floor. But the thumping persisted, a steady metronome marking the seconds of my sanity's slow decay.

I paced the room like a caged animal, my flashlight beam cutting frantic arcs through the suffocating darkness. The journal entries swirled in my head, a maelstrom of madness. *The graft took. The old root is holding.* *The mountain rot takes its tithe.* The pieces were there, but they refused to connect, forming a picture of sheer, unadulterated insanity. Out of pure desperation, I tried to call my mom, a desperate, childlike need for a familiar voice washing over me. I fumbled with my phone, the screen's cold light a small anchor in the overwhelming darkness. Of course, I had no data. But I was intent on getting a signal. I decided to go outside, to a small clearing I'd noticed on my hike. Maybe, just maybe, I could catch a single bar from some distant tower. The idea was insane, a fool's errand, but the sound was driving me to it. I needed to hear my mother's voice.

I threw on my boots and a jacket, my movements clumsy with fear. I unlocked the door, my hand trembling so much I could barely fit the key in the lock. I stepped out into the night, and the cold mountain air hit me like a physical blow. The stars were out in force, a dazzling, indifferent canopy of ice and fire above. The woods were alive with the sounds of the night—crickets, the rustle of unseen things, the distant hoot of an owl. But beneath it all, I could still hear it.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump...*

It seemed to follow me, a constant, oppressive companion. I made my way to the clearing, my flashlight beam bobbing erratically ahead of me. The clearing was about a hundred yards from the cabin, a small, open space carpeted with moss and ferns. I held my phone up, the screen's glow a tiny beacon in the vast darkness. I scanned the area, my eyes darting from shadow to shadow. For a fleeting, absurd moment, I thought I saw a flicker of signal. One solitary, ephemeral bar. It was enough. I mashed my thumb against my mom's contact photo, a desperate prayer to the gods of telecommunications.

The phone rang once, twice. A connection, a tenuous thread back to the world of sanity, of spreadsheets and rush hour traffic. She picked up on the third ring.

""Benjamin? Honey, is that you? You're cutting out.""

""Mom!"" I cried, my voice cracking with relief. ""It's me. I'm at the cabin.""

""Ben, I can barely hear you. It's all static. Are you okay? You sound... frantic.""

The static was intense, a crackling, hissing wall of white noise. But through it, her voice was a lifeline. ""I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine. Just... the quiet is getting to me, I think.""

And then, it happened.

As I spoke those words, as I tried to downplay the eldritch horror that had become my reality, the rhythmic thump-thump from the cabin suddenly intensified, as if it were reacting to the electronic signal piercing its domain. The very air in the clearing seemed to thicken, to grow heavy and charged, the way it does right before a thunderstorm. The static on the phone became a cacophony, a roar of digital chaos.

My mother's voice was a jumbled mess of static and fragmented words.

And on top of it, a new sound layered itself over the rhythmic thumping. A high-pitched, metallic tapping. A desperate, staccato counterpoint to the deep, ponderous beat.

*Tappity-tap... tap-tap-tap... Tappity-tap...*

It was faint, but it was there. A frantic Morse code of misery. The combined sounds—a monstrous bassline of biological machinery and a piercing, percussive cry for help—created a symphony of absolute dread.

""Honey? I'm losing you! Are you there?"" My mother's voice was swallowed by a final, deafening burst of static, and then... silence. The screen of my phone went black. The battery was dead. The single bar of signal had been a cruel mirage, a siren's song luring me into the very heart of the horror. I was alone again, utterly and completely alone, with the amplified sounds of my nightmare now echoing in the small clearing. I pocketed the dead phone, my hands shaking so violently I thought my bones would rattle apart. I stumbled back toward the cabin, no longer a refuge, but the very epicenter of the madness. I didn't just hear the sound anymore; I felt it in my marrow, a deep, sickening vibration that resonated with the fear liquefying my insides. I burst back inside and slammed the door, my breath coming in ragged, painful gasps. I retreated to the armchair, my pathetic fortress, and waited for the dawn, listening to the relentless, rhythmic torture.

Sleep was impossible. The sounds were a physical assault, a ceaseless barrage of low-frequency dread and high-frequency anxiety. The deep, resonant thump-thump was the foundation, the bedrock of the horror. It was the sound of immense, ponderous pressure, of something massive and ancient being forced to perform a function it was never meant for.

Sleep was just a memory to my discordant mind. My eyes, I had guessed, were bloodshot and with large bags underneath them. The only thing I could think about was my new theory. My theory, which was just that, was that there was not one, but two sources of the noises. A large, deep, resonant thump and a smaller, more desperate-sounding tapping. My mind raced, trying to reconcile the impossible with the logical. The pump was a plausible, however improbable, explanation for the thump. But the tapping? The tapping was different. It had a pattern, a desperate, almost human cadence. *Tap-tap... tap-tap-tap... tappity-tap...* It wasn't the random ticking of a loose pipe. It was communication.

As the sun broached the dreary surface of the mountains, the sounds stopped. Just as before, it was as if someone had flipped a switch, plunging the cabin back into its state of malevolent silence. I didn't feel relief. I felt dread. The silence was no longer an absence of noise; it was a promise. A promise that the night, and the sounds, would return. I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to my core, that I couldn't just wait this out. I couldn't call for help. I was the only one who could find the source. I was the only one who could stop this.

I had to find the source.

I started with the most logical place. The fireplace. The thumping felt strongest there, a deep, resonant hum that seemed to emanate from the very stone of the hearth. The chimney was a hollow column, a natural conduit for sound from below. I began my search with a crowbar I'd found in the shed, a heavy, rusted thing that felt like an extension of my own growing desperation. I worked like a man possessed, fueled by a potent cocktail of caffeine-fueled adrenaline and pure, unadulterated terror. I pried at the hearthstones, my body aching, the grout cracking and crumbling like old bone. The dust filled the air, a choking cloud of soot and decades of neglect. I coughed, my throat raw, my eyes watering, but I didn't stop.

After what felt like an eternity of back-breaking labor, I managed to loosen a large, central flagstone. I wedged the crowbar under it and threw my weight into it. With a groan of protest from the ancient mortar, the stone shifted. I heaved again, my face contorted in a grimace of exertion, and the stone finally came free, crashing onto the floor with a deafening crash that echoed in the unnaturally quiet cabin. I peered into the dark, rectangular void I had created. The air that rose up was damp, earthy, and carried that same faint, metallic, and medicinal scent I'd noticed when I first arrived. But there was nothing else. Just dirt. I shone my flashlight down, its beam cutting through the gloom. It was just a crawlspace, filled with packed earth and a few rat-chewed sacks of what looked like old grain. No pipes. No machinery. No source of the thumping.

A wave of crushing disappointment washed over me. I'd been so certain. I had staked my last shred of hope on the fireplace, on the logical assumption that the chimney was the conduit. My frantic energy dissipated, leaving me feeling hollowed out, my body aching with a fatigue that went soul-deep. I sank to my knees, the crowbar clattering from my numb fingers. I had failed. The source wasn't under the hearth. The rhythm wasn't coming from below. It was coming from... somewhere else.

I sat there for a long time, my mind a blank slate, the dust settling on my shoulders like a shroud. The cabin was a wreck. The hearth was a gaping wound in the floor, a monument to my futile, desperate search. I had torn apart the only thing that felt like the heart of the cabin, and I had found nothing.

I had to rethink. The tapping... the tapping was different. It was higher, more localized. It was a desperate plea, a frantic cry for help. But where was it coming from? I closed my eyes, my mind replaying the sounds, trying to isolate them, to triangulate their origins. The deep thump-thump was the bass note, the foundation. The tapping was the treble, the melody of misery.

I stood up, my body protesting with a symphony of aches and pains. I took a deep breath, the air thick with the dust of my failure. I decided to wait until dark to start my search again.

This time, I was more methodical. I walked the perimeter of the main room, my ear pressed against the log walls, my hand flat on the rough-hewn wood, feeling for vibrations. Nothing. I moved to the small bedroom, then the tiny kitchen. Still nothing. The sound was a phantom, a disembodied presence that mocked my efforts. I was on the verge of a complete psychological collapse, my rational mind finally surrendering to the maddening, inescapable reality of my situation. I was going to die here, my sanity eroded by a sound that I couldn't find, couldn't explain, and couldn't escape.

Then, in the main room, I saw it. It was illuminated by the spectral glow of the rising moon, a single beam of light piercing through a grimy window pane. It was a section of the floor, a small, rectangular area in the corner left of the fireplace, that was a slightly different color than the rest of the floorboards.

It was a single plank of wood in the floor, in the corner of the room. It was almost unnoticeable at first, a subtle discrepancy in the otherwise uniform pattern of the aged, dark floorboards. But once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it. This single plank was... different. The wood was a lighter shade, a honey-blonde hue that stood out starkly against the dull, weathered gray of its neighbors. The grain was tighter, the surface less worn, less scuffed. It was newer. Brighter. It was a patch. A deliberate, carefully crafted patch.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump.* That noise, the tempo to my undoing, had never been so loud.

My heart, which had been thrumming with a frantic, arrhythmic panic, suddenly seized. This was it. This had to be it. My exhaustion was burned away by a surge of adrenaline, a cold, clear certainty that washed over me. The source was here. The source had been hidden here.

I grabbed my crowbar and flashlight to get a closer look. I knelt down, my knees burning, and ran my fingers over the surface of the plank. The wood was smooth, almost sanded, and I could feel the faint outline of a seam where it met the older, rougher boards. I set my light beside me. I wedged the flat end of the crowbar into the thin seam of the newer plank. I took a deep breath, my lungs burning with the dust-laden air, and I pulled.

The wood resisted. The nails holding it in place screamed in protest, their rusted heads biting into the wood. I put my back into it, my muscles straining, my face a mask of grim determination. With a series of sharp, splintering cracks, the plank began to give way. I worked the crowbar back and forth, my movements becoming more frantic, more desperate. I wasn't just prying up a floorboard; I was performing an exorcism. I was tearing out the heart of the beast.

Finally, with one last, monumental heave, the plank came free. I wrenched it from its moorings and threw it aside. It clattered against the wall, a hollow, metallic sound. I leaned forward, my breath held tight in my chest, and shone my flashlight into the dark, rectangular void I had created.

Etched into the rough-hewn joist that supported the floor, right there in the damp, earth-smelling darkness, was a symbol. A circle, with a spiral inside it, and three jagged lines radiating out from the bottom like roots.

The symbol in the woods was a marker. A boundary. A warning. And the symbol here, hidden beneath the floorboards, was the source. The nexus.

I forced myself to look closer, my flashlight beam trembling in my unsteady hand. The symbol wasn't just carved. It was stained. A dark, dried substance, the color of old blood, was caked into the grooves of the carving.

The thumping stopped.

The sudden, absolute silence was more jarring, more terrifying than the sound itself. It was as if I had pulled a plug, and the entire world had been plunged into a deafening vacuum. The tapping, however, continued. It was clearer now, more distinct. *Tap-tap... tap-tap-tap... tappity-tap...* It was coming from below.

I had to go down there. I had to see.

The space beneath the floor was a tight, claustrophobic crawlspace, maybe three feet high. The air that wafted up was a foul mixture of damp earth, mildew, and something else... something antiseptic and coppery. I squeezed my body through the opening, my shoulders scraping against the rough joists, my flashlight beam cutting a nervous, jerky path through the oppressive dark. I was in the belly of the beast, in the space between the world above and whatever hell lay beneath.

I crawled forward, my hands sinking into the damp, cold soil, my breath fogging in the beam of my light. The tapping grew louder with every inch, a frantic, metallic percussion that seemed to vibrate through the very dirt beneath my knees. I could feel it in my teeth, a high-frequency hum that set my nerves on edge.

After a few feet of agonizingly slow progress, my light hit something solid. It wasn't wood. It wasn't stone. It was a smooth, gray, unyielding surface.

Concrete.

Someone had poured a concrete floor beneath the main floor of the cabin, sealing off the crawlspace from whatever was below. A full, reinforced concrete slab, complete with what looked like a small, square metal hatch set into its center. The hatch was about two feet by two feet, made of thick, rust-spotted iron, and was secured by a heavy, industrial-looking wheel-valve, the kind you see on old water mains. The tapping was coming from directly beneath it. It was a frantic, desperate plea, the sound of someone trapped on the other side of a tomb.

I felt a wave of nausea, a hot, sour bile rising in my throat. This was no search for a faulty pump. This was an excavation.

The hole in the floor was too small. I needed to make it bigger. I went back to the crowbar, my movements now fueled by a singular, maniacal purpose. I began to rip up the floorboards, one by one, my body aching, my lungs burning with the dust and soot. I worked like a man possessed, my mind a blank slate, my only thought the relentless, driving need to find the source. The boards splintered and cracked. The hole grew larger, a gaping wound in the floor of the cabin, a maw opening into the dark, earth-smelling unknown.

The thumping faded in again and was deafening now. The entire cabin seemed to shake with each ponderous beat. *Thump-thump... thump-thump...* It was the sound of a giant's heart, a deep, resonant pulse that vibrated through the floorboards, through the crowbar in my hands, through my very bones. My mind raced to a million folkloric explanations, each more outlandish than the last. A buried giant? The heart of the mountain itself? A trapped god? I was a data analyst, a man of logic and reason, but in that moment, I would have believed any of them. The rational world had dissolved, and I was adrift in a sea of primal fear.

The tapping, however, ceased. The frantic, metallic cry for help had been silenced. It was as if the tapper gave up, and had succumbed to the relentless, oppressive rhythm.

I had created a hole large enough to lower myself through. I sat on the edge, my legs dangling into the void, my heart hammering against my ribcage. I took a deep breath, the air thick with the dust of my own destruction, and I lowered myself down, my hands gripping the joists, my feet searching for purchase on the smooth, cold concrete. I reached to open the hatch, my fingers closing around the cold, rust-spotted iron of the wheel-valve. I turned it, my muscles straining, my breath held tight in my chest. The valve groaned in protest, a high-pitched, metallic shriek that echoed in the oppressive dark. I looked inside.

There was a ladder that was caked in rust and grime, descending into a darkness that felt alive, a darkness that seemed to press in on me, to swallow the beam of my flashlight. I took a final, deep breath of the cabin's dusty air, and I began to climb down, my flashlight clutched in my teeth, my knuckles white on the rungs of the ladder.",1,1766176728.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1pqvpng,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pqvpng/appalachian_sprites/,Appalachian Sprites,"I’ve lived in the mountainous region of southern West Virginia my entire life, my family lived in a tiny town about 45 minutes south of Charleston by the name of Whitesville. (we no longer live there, and yes I’m aware of the famous family that lives there) Every year right at the change of the seasons my grandmother would have me go with her to take offerings to invisible creatures she’s only explained to me as sprites. I’ve only seen them once and now that I have, I wouldn’t refer to them with a name that has such a kind connotation. The winter of 1998 was particularly bad early on, my grandmother had issues with her knees and was unable to take the offering due to our recent snowfall. 

Since the timing of the offerings were so important she insisted that I did it myself, at the time it wasn’t a big deal since these loaves of bread and sweets that she had left would always sit there for a few days before getting taken by what I assumed were animals. I found out very quickly my assumption was wrong and I wish I had taken it more seriously to this day. I grabbed the bread and homemade sweets and headed for our three spots, one was at the mouth of a creek. The second spot was an opening used by deer and other animals in the tree line of a small forest near us, and the final spot was at the base of a mountain at the edge of town. I walked to the creek first then the forest and placed the offerings, but it was getting cold and dark so instead of walking to the mountain’s offering location I hopped in my side by side and rode it there. Even after my grandma specifically told me to walk.

I got out of the vehicle and walked the 50 or so feet to the offering plate and glanced up the mountain as I set down the food. When I looked up I saw my grandma standing on a cliff facing away from me speaking softly to something in her hands. I called out to her and she didn’t move so assuming she hadn’t heard me I hiked up the small but steep trail to get to her. I continued to call out to her as I hiked but never got an answer, finally I reach the cliff edge she was on and touched her shoulder to get her attention. As soon as my finger touched her I noticed that all of the noises around us stopped. The wind stoped blowing, the birds stoped, the snow was no longer crunching under my feet. The snow wasn’t even cold any more, before I could realize what was happening i say

“What are you doing out here”

She continued to mutter at something in her hands that I couldn’t quite see, I tried to speak again but the sound was muffled like hearing my own voice coming from a separate room. I tried to turn her around but she didn’t budge, it was like trying to turn a stone pillar. Just as cold too, there was no warmth to her. I tried to speak again and no sound came out at all, suddenly the birds all started to caw at once. A gust of wind nearly knocked me down and the snow was colder than ever, it felt like snow had seeped in through my boots to hug my feet. I hear a voice come from all directions, it sounded like her but wasn’t. A combination of the gusts of wind and the chirping birds created a noise that sounded like her saying the sentence

“You broke the pact”

I freaked out, I ran back down the trail as fast as I could. I jumped into the side by side and looked to the cliff side where that thing that looked like her stood. It was now facing me and I could finally see it was holding a small pool of blood and a still beating heart  in its hands. I looked up to where its face should’ve been and to my horror saw a constantly shifting mass of rock and gravel folding into itself. There was another powerful gust of wind that I was forced to shield my face from by looking down, a few seconds later I looked back up and she was running at me on all fours. I stepped on the gas and hauled ass back to the house, I had no idea what to do but I knew my grandmother would. I looked back checking occasionally to make sure that thing was no longer following me and saw that I was finally in the clear just before I pulled up to our front door. I ran inside to ask her what to do, but she was nowhere to be found. A fresh still steaming cup of coffee was on the end table next to her chair and her shoes were still by the door. We never found her, and I never saw that “sprite” again. A few days later I packed a bag and stayed with a friend up north near the Ripley area, I’ve never set foot in that particular holler since and never will.",2,1766176720.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

However, 2025 was the year I felt the greatest, almost no pain. I was able to go back to church and attend the services weekly, even joined a music program for worshippers (since walking can be painful for me, I don’t go out much and attending church has always been an issue for me). But three months ago the pain came back. I had to stop going to church, and now I can barely get out of bed to go to the kitchen and make a cup of coffee, making me very dependent on my family members for help.

Especially if you’re broke and don’t enjoy bar-hopping every weekend.

I’m thinking about starting a Discord server for young adults in the greater Nashville area to make it easier to meet people and actually do things.

The idea:

A Discord to connect and chat

Monthly or bi-monthly low-cost meetups (coffee, parks, game nights, etc.)

If the group gets enough traction it could potentially develop sub-groups or spinnoffs (DND, Chess, Cooking, Etc)

Think “school clubs,” but without the school

Age-wise it would mainly be aimed at people in their 20s (roughly 18-28), but I’m not trying to be strict, more about shared stage of life than a hard cutoff.

Before I make a Discord or plan anything I’d like to see:

Would people actually be interested in this?

What kinds of meetups would be interesting to the community?

Preferred platform for communication if not Discord?

Drop your Discord in the comments or shoot me a DM. Thanks for reading : )

Edit: discord link: https://discord.gg/FMRmrtw7H7 (really still a work in progress but If you want to go ahead and join I'll do my best to get as much done as I can when I get off)

Edit 2: This post was to discuss the creation of a group for meetups for young adults, not a request for advice on making friends or for burnt out 30/40yr olds to complain abt how hard they have it. Not trying to throw any shade but if you don't have anything relevant, or just want to shit on me/my idea could you like just move on instead?",4,1766176457.0,nashville,33,0.59,False

When you take your socks off, don’t put them back in a ball or they’ll go through the wash and dryer like that. 

When you go to the washroom and the toilet paper runs out, put a new roll on.

When you make a can of soup, don’t leave the can on the counter. Wash it out and throw it in the garbage.

he also did a lot of things for me, like things you don't offer to a random friend. i was also putting in effort, suggested plans, complimented him, listened to him talk a lot. all this time there was no physical contact or any conversation about our feelings - to me it was kind of a talking stage(?) or just initial phase before dating. i assumed he might be interested but we are both very shy so i thought it's the issue here.

but since a few days i feel he is very different. like i must have done something wrong or say something that he sees as a red flag. the contact is very irregular and dry. it's understandable, everyone can change their mind, but i value communication and a) want to know the issue to see what to change in myself for the future b) know what did he see all of this as. 

at the same time i don't think we were on that level of closeness yet or maybe nothing really happened but he just sees me as a friend and me asking why he became distant would reveal my feelings and turn him off.

1pqvevb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pqvevb/i_hate_getting_gifts_from_my_mum/,I hate getting gifts from my mum...,"Im just going to start off with I know this is going to sound extremely entitled but this has honestly given me such a complex and kinda makes me dread December (my bday+holidays) even tho it used to be my fave time of the year. 

My mother has historically never been the best at giving gifts. Which is fine, not everyone is good at it, it presented a bit of a problem growing up however as we really didn't have any money to spare. We were going through some financial difficulties, huge debt and all that comes with it (it wasnt my parents fault they just got hit by some rotten luck). So the only time of year I would actually get things I needed, or occasionally just wanted was around my birthday/xmas. Any hobbies I wanted to do for the whole year, any clothes I needed, any makeup or accessories I wanted to keep up with my peers, that was the only time I would get them, because thats how my mum was able to budget it. This became an issue pretty quickly when she just wouldn't buy me things I liked, or could use. She generally bought me things that she liked or was interested in from shops that she shopped at. I could tell her what I wanted and why, but she would always just get what she wanted, and she has some pretty unique taste. Itd be stuff like Id ask for a new rucksack and shed get a cath kidston makeup bag, and some other sets from cath kidston (that would all work out to the same price as the bag I asked for) so then I would both have an object I didn't like and will not use, and I would not have the thing I wanted and needed. Often shed buy me clothes in sizes that didn't fit, would get offended if they didn't fit me and then return them and just keep the money instead of exchanging for something that fits me. (This frustration would be doubled when a few months later shed get my sister the exact same thing I asked for and would deny any recollection of me telling her about it and writing it down on a list)

If I asked for her to just give me the money instead shed get offended, if I didn't use the stuff she gave me or expressed that it wasnt my cup of tea she would get extremely offended and guilt trip me bc we didn't really have the money for this stuff in the fist place. So I tried to be more specific spend hours making extremely specific detailed lists with links and instructions, she would complain it was too overwhelming and instead of using it would just get me something she wanted instead. So i tried sending her pictures, giving her clear sizes, giving her brand info, colours, everything as clearly as possible. That was a bit more successful but generally I would be lumped with a bunch of random stuff that I didnt really want, or like that made me feel like i dressed weird compared to other kids, and we couldnt afford any other clothes/art/hobby stuff for the rest of the year so that was it.

As an adult this matters a lot less now. Ive spent a great deal of time and effort becoming independent and doing my best to make sure I actually have everything I need so gifts are now much more in the category of 'nice free stuff that someone is giving you because they care about you.' My parents are also no longer in debt thankfully. Honestly usually if anyone gets me anything Im thrilled, and if anyone gets me anything I actually like Im double thrilled. Ive also always believed Im actually a pretty easy person to gift for in something like secret santa. I like art, if you got me a sketchbook or something vaguely art related, or some dairy free chocolate (im lactose intolerant) Ill think the sun shines out of your arse. 

However every year my mum makes me make her a list of stuff I want, every year she either ignores the list or the clothes dont fit me and I get more disappointed, because its happening AGAIN, and she gets more offended and will pick a fight about something ridiculous and use it as an excuse to say the worst things imagineable and make me cry. Even if I pretend to like it and the clothes just dont fit, she will get extremely offended and pick a fight. Sometimes she will even give me a version of the item I specifically asked for her to not get, one year I lost my (deceased before I was born) grandmothers nacklace. I was gutted as it was the only thing of hers I owned. An octagonal st Christopher necklace. I asked for another octagonal one like my grandmothers to remind me of her (but not a circle one please not a circle one, I know theres lots available but I dont like how they look and my grandmothers was octagonal). So naturally my mother gave me an engraved circular one, so I couldnt return it. 

The real kicker is for a few years running now what i really NEED is driving lessons (i missed my opportunity thanks to covid and just havent been able to scrape together the money since, cheers cozzie livs) every year what Ive asked for is money to put in a pot to go to that, and every year Im told she just wants to get me one or two little bits or shell feel bad, then she spends loads of money on a bunch of stuff I dont want and theres no money left for lessons, try again next year. Ive been sitting here thinking and its been a few years since then, if theyd have actually listened to me and wacked it all in a pot, it wouldn't be loads of money but Id be a lot closer to that elusive test than right now (plus id have probably racked up some interest) instead of spending hours i dont have shopping for my birthday to compile an information sheet for my mother that then transaltes to things I dont like and dont want that also dont fit.

This year I feel a bit more frustrated than usual to be honest, largely because I had such a lovely time for my birthday. My parents are going thru a messy divorce so I decided to skip going home and stay with a friend for the weekend, and the day went perfectly. Id saved up enough money to get everything I wanted/needed, and lucked into getting a freebie product they were giving away for xmas that Id been dying to get but couldn't justify the price. I was able to see everyone I planned to and squeezed in coffee with my brother where he got me a little book at a cute bookshop we went to (he didn't have to it was v kind), I went for a meal with friends that was perfect and went to a concert my friend got tix for (I didnt know the band but they were an absolute blast - i even got a t shirt to commemorate). Luck was defo on my side, and for the first time in over a decade i didnt cry on my birthday!!!!

Because it didnt see them over the weekend my parents sent me gifts in the post, I told them not to (ill see them for xmas anyway and its the same month) but they have. My dad sent me a gift himself for the first time this year (usually my mum just buys them). When he asked I told him this year I just want to focus on getting a driving license, anything he would have spent on me I would just need in cash and I will put it away to save, a bit rubbish but the only thing I need in life rn is that license. He sent me in the post a one for all giftcard with the money for driving lessons on it. Enormous L. So now I have to figure out a way to use this card, Ive heard you can use it in food shops so its not a total disaster but it is an absolute pain in the arse bc now I need to figure out a way to spend the giftcard on necessities and save my money. At least he did give me money in a form so its close to what I need? I won't be able to take driving lessons consistently until my savings pot is much larger anyway so it might be good that the money is temporarily inaccessable?

My mum on the other hand has been struggling financially since the separation, I originally asked her for driving lessons but I didn't want her to spend so much on me when she needs it so much more so I told her not to send me money, that she didn't have to get me anything, she insisted she wanted to so i told her I could really do with another jumper (ideally something vintage (they're about £20 usually)), or a tote bag with pockets, or I could really do with new scarf/hat/gloves, and nothing else plz dont spend lots of money on me, in fact plz dont even send the whole list just pick one or two things. I sent her example photos of some brown toned patterned vintage jumpers on vinted, told her I wear xl mens jumpers (oversized and work with my wide hips). Told her Id like a cream or red or purple or green bag or scarf if poss, and thought (which I do every year) no way she can go wrong with this. Knitwear is hard to mess up, vintage jumpers all look the same, they're mostly brown, a tote bag is a tote bag and thats not too much money to splash out, hopefully shell spend less than £60. Then I wont have to feel the deep consuming guilt I feel each year for not liking her gifts. I have now received two packages in the post, Im told theres more on the way. She has very clearly spent more than £80. I honestly wish I hadnt felt bad and let her send me the money. So far she has sent me (and im now going to be very unkind about this jumper largely out of frustration) the most hideous jumper I think the 80s could have ever cooked up. Now this jumper confuses me so deeply because it is unquestionably ugly and unfashionable, but its also not something i could imagine my mother picking out for herself, so i dont know why she picked it. She could have asked me or my brothers and she definitely didnt. Its a VERY light grey (a challenging colour for a lot of people, but especially for me because im ginger, I have never worn light grey and generally avoid grey as a rule) with a very minimalistic pattern in like two rows on the top and the bottom of the jumper in a very saturated electric blue (another colour I avoid like the plague.) I think in very bright natural light the blue looks like it may have once been purple and green (maybe thats why she picked it?) but now it just looks blue. To top it all off its actually too small for me and doesn't fit so I cant even suck it up at xmas and wear it out of politeness. Im not sure why she picked THIS jumper, especially when it deveates so drastically from any reference photo I sent her AND the vast majority of jumpers available to buy. Its like she went out of her way to get it? I also dont really know what to do with it now? I cant tell her i dont like it, Im not sure I can even tell her it doesn't fit, but I also dont want to be given more jumpers like this in the future. Maybe one of my brothers will think its cool idk? Ive got a blonde friend he might like it? 

The second thing she sent me, that I received today, the one that really frustrated me and actually prompted me to write this was she sent me a set of clinique skincare and makeup. Now this is a lovely gift, and if I was my mother Im sure I would be thrilled. The first thought that went into my mind was omg this is so expensive I didn't want her to spend too much money on me. The second thought was, I dont even like clinique. The only makeup of theirs I own is black honey (because their makeup is expensive and doesn't really work), and theres only one moisturizer of theirs I can use, all their other stuff breaks me out. This set contains black honey (once again, I already own it) and that moisturizer i can use, but everything else in it is actually unuseable for me, so now she has given me something really expensive that I didn't ask for, didn't need and dont like. I would have rather not been given the moisturizer and she kept the money, I own and use a different moisturizer, my skin is really good atm, I just don't need it. And it frustrates me because SHE loves clinique. Its her ride or die. Not mine. I have never been fussed about brand name skincare, my skin is difficult, I like things that work. Shes wasted money she doesn't have and to be completely honest its a gift for herself, the only thing she has given me by sending me this ludicrously expensive set is intense feelings of shame for being ungrateful, guilt that she spent money on me that she needs far more and frustration that my own mother seemingly knows me less than anyone else in my life.

This is a very entitled rant I know. It just seems like there is no solution to this issue that consistently frustrates me more and more each year. Sometimes i wonder if shes doing it on purpose, Im genuinely not sure what reaction she expects when she ignores 8 different options because one of them was sold out and picks something wildly different. Thing is Im not opposed to surprises, I actually love them, shes just completely incapable of guessing things I will like, or even things close to what I would like - hence the lists, and I think all the work makes it more annoying when she gets it so wrong. I think I might just ask her not to get me anything next year, or firm it with a financial contribution to some long term thing Im saving for if she insists. I just really dont like wasting money on things I wont use, I could use that money for driving lessons, mum could use it for legal fees!

Tldr- my mothers poor gift giving ability stresses me out and causes arguments each year. I have tried to mitigate the problem by sending her thorough suggestions. She ignores them, and makes me feel horrid for not using her gifts bc we dont have much money. This year she has done it again, and its stressing me out bc she needs that money for legal fees and I will not use what she has sent me.",2,1766175955.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I've never been closeted--first time I fell for a woman, I was simply not going to let anything stop me from being with her. Today, I'm happily married to a woman I've been with for 20 years.

I joined a hobby group about 2 years ago at around the same time as another woman who set off my gaydar. After a few meetings, we went out for coffee together. She's 70 years old, married 50 years with children and grandchildren, active in her religious community as well as the community at large. So, in my head, I toggle that demographic switch in my head to ""straight woman,"" and also toggled ""religious."" Because of the trauma I went through during coming out, ""straight, religious woman"" comes with big warning flags. But she seemed really friendly and interested in knowing me, and didn't seem judgy or uncomfortable the way some religious folk can be around queer folk. So we start hanging out maybe once a month or a little more--always for coffee. And I'm always on my best behavior as a lesbian because I don't want to scare the religious grandmother. For me, it was a casual friendship.

About 4 months ago now, she comes to coffee very agitated, and starts telling me about how  her dead mother traumatized her, and she's speaking angrily in a way that feels directed to me. It's hard to put this into words that doesn't sound crazy, but I came away knowing she was angry at me for reasons I didn't understand, she needed to know I loved her and trusted her, and my amends had to be more than simply ""I'm sorry."" Let's just say, it became clear to me she is one of those old time dykes who marries and carries on super-secret affairs with women on the side. And I know that in eras before I came out, these women spoke to each other in the subtext of their conversations--she would've been 20 in 1975 or so.

It turns out, she has been trying to get my attention and seduce me for like 2 years now. I'm not going there with her--I love my wife and would never hurt her like that. But she cannot seem to break out of this code speak. She is super protective/secretive. I don't mean like, ""I don't tell people at work."" I mean like so closeted that she never says it out loud--like Children's Hour closeted, for those who know the classic movies. I let her know that I care about her and that she's safe with me, but the head games of this code speak is exhausting. Like, she stays underwater, she's so deep under cover. I want to be supportive, but I don't know how to talk to her. Anyway, I'm frustrated.

Does anyone know what I mean about the old lesbians speaking in code? I've always been out, so I just never used it and am totally tired of the double speak.",12,1766175812.0,LesbianActually,0,0.93,False

I'm a man of numbers, of spreadsheets, and the cold, hard logic of algorithms. You can call me Ben. Thirty-two years old, junior data analyst at a mid-sized firm that optimizes supply chains for a living. My world is one of quantifiable metrics, efficiency reports, and the soul-crushing glow of a monitor at 3 a.m. I believe in what can be measured, what can be tested, and what can be replicated. Ghost stories, mountain curses, folk tales of things that go bump in the night—those are the currencies of the credulous, the soft-headed, the people who buy lottery tickets with their rent money.

So when I inherited my grandfather's cabin—a place I hadn't seen since I was ten and had largely erased from my memory—I didn't see it as the acquisition of some hallowed family ground steeped in local legend. I saw it as a data point in my life's equation: a variable. An asset. A sudden, unexpected, and frankly, welcome escape hatch from the urban treadmill I'd been mindlessly jogging on for a decade. The property, nestled deep in the Appalachian wilderness of western North Carolina, was described by the lawyer in sterile, legal terms: ""a rustic dwelling on a sizable parcel of land, bequeathed by your paternal grandfather, Lazarus Blackwood, upon his passing."" The cause of death was listed as ""a long and private illness."" I remember him vaguely. A quiet, intense man with hands like gnarled oak roots and eyes that seemed to hold the shadows of the deep woods he inhabited. We never connected. My father had fled these mountains as a teenager and never looked back, marrying my mother and settling into the suburban flatlands of Ohio, where the most mysterious thing to happen was the occasional power outage during a thunderstorm. My father died when I was twelve, and it was an, albeit unwelcome, surprise to see him go long before my grandfather.

The drive up was a nauseating exercise in surrendering control. My Prius, a vessel of modern efficiency and environmental consciousness, whined in protest as the paved roads gave way to gravel, then to rutted dirt tracks that seemed designed by a vindictive deity to punish hubris. The forest pressed in on all sides, a cathedral of ancient, indifferent hardwoods. Canopy so dense it blotted out the sun, dappling the road in shifting patterns of gloom. The air changed, too. It grew thicker, heavier, saturated with the sweet, cloying scent of decay—wet leaves, rotting wood, the damp, fungal perfume of a world that lived by its own rules.

The drive up was a journey through layers of civilization peeling away. The six-lane arteries of the city thinned to four, then two. Pavement gave way to asphalt, then to a winding, potholed scar of gravel that twisted up into the mountains like a dying serpent.

I stopped at a lowly convenience store about 30 miles out to get a drink and snacks. A woman with hair the color of rust and eyes the color of moss gave me a look as I paid for my supplies. She was wearing an old, faded t-shirt that was so stained I couldn't tell what the original design was.

“You're that Blackwood boy, ain'tcha?” she asked, her voice a dry rustle.

The question hung in the air, thick and uncomfortable. I forced a smile. “Yeah, hi. Ben. Just heading up to the cabin for a bit.”

She nodded slowly, her gaze unwavering. “Be careful up there. Them mountains… they got their own ways.""

*Well*, I thought, *just kill me now*.

My GPS signal died twenty miles out, and my phone followed suit shortly after. I was officially off the grid. The final few miles were navigated by memory—or what I could dredge up of it—and the rudimentary map the lawyer had included, a hand-drawn thing my grandfather had apparently made decades ago. The cabin didn't appear so much as it resolved itself out of the mist and the towering, brooding sentinels of ancient pines. It was larger than I remembered, built from massive, dark logs that seemed to absorb the weak afternoon light. A stone chimney, patched and repatched over the years, clawed at the sky like a broken finger. There was a profound, almost suffocating silence here, a silence so dense it felt like a physical presence after the constant, subliminal hum of the city.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of pine, dust, and something else... something vaguely medicinal and metallic. Decades of my grandfather's life were layered here. Books on botany and regional folklore were crammed into makeshift shelves. Mason jars filled with unidentifiable herbs and tinctures lined a kitchen counter. Everything was solid, heavy, and functional, built to last longer than the men who made it. It was a fortress against the wilderness, and against something else, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was the kind of place that made you feel like an intruder, even if you owned the deed.

I spent the first two days in a state of blissful decompression. I unplugged. I read. I hiked a few of the trails marked on the old map, the cool mountain air a welcome balm to my city-scorched lungs. I fixed a loose shutter, chopped firewood, and generally reveled in the simple, tactile reality of it all. At night, the silence was absolute, so profound that the occasional hoot of an owl or the scuttling of some unseen thing in the walls was a startling, almost violent event. I slept like the dead, a deep, dreamless sleep I hadn't experienced since childhood. I felt, for the first time in years, genuinely restored.

I explored every corner of the cabin, trying to piece together the ghost of the man I barely knew. In a desk drawer, beneath a stack of yellowed botanical charts, I found a small, leather-bound journal. The handwriting was a cramped, precise scrawl, almost impossible to decipher. The entries were sporadic, spanning decades.

September 12th, 1978: *The graft took. The old root is holding. The land is satisfied. Must maintain the balance.*

March 3rd, 1985: *Another tremor. Tap-tap. It grows weaker. I grow stronger. The paradox is a crucible.*

June 21st, 1992: *The sickness has returned. Not to it. To me. The mountain rot takes its tithe.*

The entries were cryptic, a mix of what looked like vague agricultural notes and something far more esoteric. It read like the ravings of an eccentric old man, a folk doctor who'd spent too long talking to his plants. I dismissed it as the ramblings of a loner who'd created his own private mythology to stave off the crushing solitude. More mountain nonsense.

On the third night, it started.

I was drifting off to sleep, cocooned in the unfamiliar scratch of the wool blankets, when I heard it.

*Thump.*

A single, deep, resonant sound. I blinked my eyes open, my mind instantly cataloging possibilities. Settling. The cabin was old. Wood expands and contracts. I lay there, listening. Nothing. The silence rushed back in to fill the void. I rolled over, chalking it up to my own hypersensitivity in this new, quiet environment.

A minute later.

*Thump-thump.*

Same spot, same sound. But two in quick succession. Low, almost sub-audible, but definite. Muffled. Coming from... below me? Or maybe the walls? I just hoped to God it wasn't from outside. I sat up, straining my ears. My rational brain kicked in. Thermal contraction of the beams. A pinecone falling on the roof. The possibilities were mundane, plentiful. I told myself to relax, to get a grip. I was a grown man, not a child afraid of the dark. I lay back down, forcing myself to breathe slowly, deliberately. Sleep eventually reclaimed me, a fitful, restless sleep haunted by the echo of that sound.

The next morning, I almost convinced myself it hadn't happened. I went about with a slight undercurrent of unease, but it soon washed away at the sight of the sun-drenched valley from the porch.

On my hike that afternoon, I went deeper into the woods than before, following a deer trail that twisted through a dense stand of ancient hemlocks. The beauty was staggering, a cathedral of green and brown and dappled gold. I came across a strange symbol carved into the trunk of a massive, lightning-scarred oak. It was a crude, primitive thing: a circle with a spiral inside it, and three jagged lines radiating out from the bottom like roots. My grandfather's mark, perhaps? A boundary marker? Or just some random act of vandalism from some other, more primitive hiker.

As I continued down the trail, I noticed other things. The land on this property was unnervingly fertile, a lush, riotous green that stood in stark, almost unnatural, contrast to the thinner, paler vegetation on the neighboring properties I'd seen on the drive in. The trees here were giants, their trunks impossibly thick. There was a sense of life here that was almost aggressive, palpable. It felt... old. Primordial.

Then, I heard it.

It was not a bear, not a coyote, not a fox, not a wild boar, and not any other animal I had ever heard before. It was a low, guttural, and mournful cry, a sound that seemed to be ripped from the very earth itself. It was a sound of immense pain and loneliness, a sound that vibrated in my bones. It was the kind of sound that made the hairs on my arms stand on end, the kind of sound that made me want to turn and run. I stood frozen for a full minute, listening to the echoes die away, my heart hammering against my ribcage. It wasn't a roar or a snarl. It was a lament. And it was close.

I practically sprinted back to the cabin, the joy of my nature walk completely evaporated, replaced by a primal fear I hadn't felt since I was a child. I burst through the door, slamming it behind me and leaning against it, my chest heaving. The silence inside the cabin was suddenly menacing, not peaceful.

I spent the rest of the day inside, my mind replaying the cry, the symbol, the unnatural fecundity of the land. The rational part of my brain, the part that had served me so well for thirty-two years, was fighting a losing battle against a rising tide of irrational dread. I found myself drawn back to my grandfather's desk, to the cryptic journal. I devoured the entries again, this time not as the ramblings of an old eccentric, but as potential clues.

*The graft took. The old root is holding.*

What if ""root"" wasn't just a metaphor for a plant? What if it was something else? Something more… fundamental?

*The mountain rot takes its tithe.*

The mountain rot. I'd heard whispers of it in town. A wasting sickness that supposedly afflicted families who had lived on the land for too long, a localized curse that bled the life from them slowly, over generations. Folklore. Just folklore. But the words on the page, combined with that terrifying cry in the woods, were weaving a new, more horrifying narrative in my mind. I started tearing through the other books on the shelves, not looking for botany charts anymore, but for anything on local history, on folklore, on the ""mountain rot.""

I found a dusty, leather-bound tome titled ""The Blood of the Land: A Compendium of Appalachian Folk Practices."" The author was anonymous. The pages were filled with handwritten notes in the margins, in my grandfather's familiar, cramped scrawl. I flipped through it, my hands trembling. Most of it was the standard stuff I'd expect—cures for warts using potato peelings, charms for good weather, stories of the Cherokee Little People. But then, tucked between a passage on dowsing rods and a recipe for poultice made from ""graveyard dirt,"" was a chapter that made my heart stumble a bit.

It was titled ""The Root Graft.""

The theory was… monstrous. It posited that the land itself, particularly in these ancient, isolated mountains, was a living entity, a primordial organism. Some families, the ""First Bloods,"" who had settled and tamed the land generations ago, had developed a symbiotic relationship with it. But like any symbiosis, it had a parasitic side. The land would eventually turn on its inhabitants, draining them of their vitality. The ""mountain rot.""

It was insane. It was the stuff of cheap paperback horror novels. But my grandfather had clearly believed it.

As the fourth night fell, the cabin felt less like a sanctuary and more like a cage. I locked the door. A useless, pathetic gesture against an enemy I couldn't even name, if it wasn't just my own mind. I was wide awake, reading a worn paperback by the light of a battery-powered lantern, when it began. Not a single thump, but a steady, maddening rhythm.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump... thump-thump...*

It was a heartbeat. A slow, ponderous, impossibly deep heartbeat. Amplified. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. From the floorboards beneath my feet. From the very walls of the cabin. From the stone hearth of the fireplace. It vibrated through the bedframe, a low, resonant hum that sank into my bones. I shot up, my heart hammering in my chest in frantic, arrhythmic counterpoint to the slow, deliberate beat from below.

I got out of bed, my bare feet silent on the cold wood. I crept from room to room, a hunter stalking an unseen prey. In the kitchen, the sound was clearer, but still muffled, as if originating from deep within the earth beneath the foundation. I pressed my ear to the floor. The vibration was stronger here, a physical pressure against my eardrum. My mind raced, a frantic flurry of rationalizations. An old generator? A water pump with a failing pressure switch? A well pump, maybe? Yes, that made sense. Grandfather probably had a well. The pump must be malfunctioning, cycling on and off. A relief, a mundane explanation for a terrifying phenomenon. I could fix a pump. I could call a well service. I just needed a phone signal.

But the sound didn't stop. It continued, a relentless, metronomic pulse. A slow, steady beat that stretched into the night. I didn't sleep at all. I just sat in the worn armchair by the cold fireplace, a blanket wrapped around my shoulders, and listened as the hours bled into one another. The sun rose, a pale, anaemic disc in a sky the color of bruised plums, and the sound finally, blessedly, faded away with the last fragments of darkness. I was left hollowed out, my nerves frayed, my body aching with a fatigue that went bone-deep. The silence that returned was now a mockery, a temporary reprieve. I knew it would be back.

The next day was an exercise in psychological torment. Every creak of the floorboards was a potential prelude. Every gust of wind whistling through the eaves was a distorted echo of the rhythm. The cabin was no longer a refuge; it was a resonant chamber for a sound that was systematically dismantling my sanity. I decided to spend the day down the mountain in the small town I'd passed through. I needed supplies, yes, but more than that, I needed the noise of civilization, the anodyne clamor of traffic and people, to drown out the memory of the night's horror. I also needed to ask about a well service.

The drive down was nerve-wracking. Every shadow on the road seemed to coalesce into some new horror. The rustling leaves sounded like whispers. I was becoming one of them. One of the credulous, the soft-headed.

The town was called Harrow's Creek. It was a place that looked like it had been forgotten by progress, a cluster of dusty storefronts and faded clapboard houses clinging to the side of the mountain. I parked in front of the general store, the same one where the rust-haired woman had worked. She wasn't there today. Instead, a man with a beer gut straining against a grease-stained t-shirt was leaning against the counter, reading a dog-eared copy of Field and Stream. He looked up as I entered, his eyes a pale, washed-out blue.

""Afternoon,"" he grunted, not unfriendly.

""Afternoon,"" I replied, my own voice sounding thin and reedy. ""I was wondering if you could help me. I'm up at the old Blackwood cabin.""

His expression didn't change, but a flicker of something—recognition? apprehension?—passed through his eyes. ""The Blackwood place, eh? Your kin?""

""My grandfather's. Lazarus Blackwood.""

The man nodded slowly, a deliberate, thoughtful gesture. ""Old Lazarus. A quiet one. Knew these woods better than any man alive. Kept to himself, mostly."" He looked me up and down, a frank, appraising stare. ""You don't look like much of a woodsman.""

""I'm not,"" I admitted, a little too quickly. ""Look, the reason I came down is... the place has a well, right?""

""I'm sure it does.""

""I think the pump is acting up,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady, casual. ""It's making this... noise. A thumping. A rhythmic thumping, like... like a heartbeat."" The word slipped out before I could stop it, a crack in my carefully constructed veneer of pragmatism.

The man's face, which had been a mask of rural indifference, tightened. His eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward slightly over the counter, the springs of the old stool beneath him groaning in protest. The air in the store grew heavy, thick with unspoken things.

""Heartbeat, you say?"" he said, his voice now a low, deliberate murmur. ""How... regular is it?""

The question was so specific that I was taken aback a bit. He wasn't surprised. He wasn't trying to diagnose a faulty pressure switch. He was confirming a suspicion.

""It's... it's very regular,"" I stammered, my composure finally shattering. ""Thump-thump... thump-thump. All night long. It starts at dusk and stops at dawn. It's driving me insane.""

The man, whose name was, according to a patch on his shirt, Rocky, didn't answer right away. He stared past me, out the dusty window at the brooding green expanse of the mountains. He seemed to be wrestling with something, a decision. Finally, he let out a long, slow breath that smelled of stale coffee and regret.

""Look, son,"" he said, turning his washed-out blue eyes back to me. ""I'm not going up there. No one is.""

""What? Why? It's just a pump! I'll pay whatever it takes!"" My voice was rising, tinged with the hysteria I'd been fighting all morning.

""It ain't the pump,"" Rocky said, his tone flat, final. ""And it ain't just a noise. Some things on this mountain... they ain't meant to be messed with. Your grandfather, he understood that..."" He trailed off, shaking his head. ""You should go back to the city. Just... walk away from that place. Tear up the deed. It ain't worth it.""

""Understood what?"" I demanded, my hands clenching into fists on the counter. ""What the hell is going on up there?""

Rocky's gaze dropped to the worn countertop. ""Best you leave now,"" he mumbled, suddenly refusing to meet my eyes. ""Before it gets dark.""

A cold dread, far more profound than the fear induced by the sound, seeped into my bones. This wasn't about a faulty well pump. This was something else, something the locals knew, something they feared. It was the same look the rust-haired woman had given me, the same cryptic warnings. I'm quite the skeptic, but my brain wasn't exactly running to rationality in the moment.

""But I can't just leave,"" I pleaded, the words feeling pathetic even as I spoke them. ""It's my cabin. My inheritance.""

Rocky finally looked up, and in his eyes, I saw a flicker of something that looked an awful lot like pity. ""Son, that ain't an inheritance. It's a chain.""

With that, I left the store in a daze, my arms full of canned goods, bottled water, and a flashlight with extra batteries I'd bought on pure, primal instinct. The ""chain"" he'd spoken of felt real, a cold, heavy weight settling around my neck. I got back in my car, my mind a scattering of Rocky's words, the rhythmic thumping from the night before, and the cryptic entries in my grandfather's journal. I couldn't leave. Not yet. My own brand of stubbornness, a trait I must have inherited from the very man who'd left me this nightmare, refused to let me flee with my tail between my legs. I had to understand. I had to know.

I drove back up the mountain, the setting sun casting long, monstrous shadows across the road. The cabin, when I reached it, was a dark, hulking silhouette against a sky bleeding from orange to a deep, bruised purple. The silence was already waiting for me, a coiled serpent ready to strike. I unloaded my supplies, my movements quick and jerky, my head swiveling at every rustle of leaves. I locked the door behind me, the deadbolt sliding into place with a sound that was both comforting and utterly futile.

I ate a cold dinner of canned beans, my appetite gone, the food tasting like ash in my mouth. I barricaded myself in the main room, piling a heavy armchair and a small oak table against the door, a pathetic little fort against the unknown. The last rays of light faded, and the cabin was plunged into a profound darkness, broken only by the weak, yellow beam of my flashlight.

I didn't have to wait long.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump... thump-thump...*

It started right on cue, as the last vestiges of twilight surrendered to the night. The sound was different tonight. Clearer. More insistent. It was no longer just a sound; it was a presence. It felt personal, directed. It was the sound of a malevolent intelligence, a slow, deliberate mockery of life itself. I could feel it in the floorboards, in the air I breathed, in the fillings of my teeth. My own heart was a frantic, trapped bird fluttering against my ribs, a panicked counterpoint to the slow, steady pulse from below.

I looked around for any well or pump, any source, but I couldn't find anything. It was like the sound was coming from the very dirt under the cabin. The floorboards were old, but they were solid. I decided to pull up a small area rug to see if I could find a hatch or a trapdoor. Nothing. Just a dark, stained wooden floor. But the thumping persisted, a steady metronome marking the seconds of my sanity's slow decay.

I paced the room like a caged animal, my flashlight beam cutting frantic arcs through the suffocating darkness. The journal entries swirled in my head, a maelstrom of madness. *The graft took. The old root is holding.* *The mountain rot takes its tithe.* The pieces were there, but they refused to connect, forming a picture of sheer, unadulterated insanity. Out of pure desperation, I tried to call my mom, a desperate, childlike need for a familiar voice washing over me. I fumbled with my phone, the screen's cold light a small anchor in the overwhelming darkness. Of course, I had no data. But I was intent on getting a signal. I decided to go outside, to a small clearing I'd noticed on my hike. Maybe, just maybe, I could catch a single bar from some distant tower. The idea was insane, a fool's errand, but the sound was driving me to it. I needed to hear my mother's voice.

I threw on my boots and a jacket, my movements clumsy with fear. I unlocked the door, my hand trembling so much I could barely fit the key in the lock. I stepped out into the night, and the cold mountain air hit me like a physical blow. The stars were out in force, a dazzling, indifferent canopy of ice and fire above. The woods were alive with the sounds of the night—crickets, the rustle of unseen things, the distant hoot of an owl. But beneath it all, I could still hear it.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump...*

It seemed to follow me, a constant, oppressive companion. I made my way to the clearing, my flashlight beam bobbing erratically ahead of me. The clearing was about a hundred yards from the cabin, a small, open space carpeted with moss and ferns. I held my phone up, the screen's glow a tiny beacon in the vast darkness. I scanned the area, my eyes darting from shadow to shadow. For a fleeting, absurd moment, I thought I saw a flicker of signal. One solitary, ephemeral bar. It was enough. I mashed my thumb against my mom's contact photo, a desperate prayer to the gods of telecommunications.

The phone rang once, twice. A connection, a tenuous thread back to the world of sanity, of spreadsheets and rush hour traffic. She picked up on the third ring.

""Benjamin? Honey, is that you? You're cutting out.""

""Mom!"" I cried, my voice cracking with relief. ""It's me. I'm at the cabin.""

""Ben, I can barely hear you. It's all static. Are you okay? You sound... frantic.""

The static was intense, a crackling, hissing wall of white noise. But through it, her voice was a lifeline. ""I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine. Just... the quiet is getting to me, I think.""

And then, it happened.

As I spoke those words, as I tried to downplay the eldritch horror that had become my reality, the rhythmic thump-thump from the cabin suddenly intensified, as if it were reacting to the electronic signal piercing its domain. The very air in the clearing seemed to thicken, to grow heavy and charged, the way it does right before a thunderstorm. The static on the phone became a cacophony, a roar of digital chaos.

My mother's voice was a jumbled mess of static and fragmented words.

And on top of it, a new sound layered itself over the rhythmic thumping. A high-pitched, metallic tapping. A desperate, staccato counterpoint to the deep, ponderous beat.

*Tappity-tap... tap-tap-tap... Tappity-tap...*

It was faint, but it was there. A frantic Morse code of misery. The combined sounds—a monstrous bassline of biological machinery and a piercing, percussive cry for help—created a symphony of absolute dread.

""Honey? I'm losing you! Are you there?"" My mother's voice was swallowed by a final, deafening burst of static, and then... silence. The screen of my phone went black. The battery was dead. The single bar of signal had been a cruel mirage, a siren's song luring me into the very heart of the horror. I was alone again, utterly and completely alone, with the amplified sounds of my nightmare now echoing in the small clearing. I pocketed the dead phone, my hands shaking so violently I thought my bones would rattle apart. I stumbled back toward the cabin, no longer a refuge, but the very epicenter of the madness. I didn't just hear the sound anymore; I felt it in my marrow, a deep, sickening vibration that resonated with the fear liquefying my insides. I burst back inside and slammed the door, my breath coming in ragged, painful gasps. I retreated to the armchair, my pathetic fortress, and waited for the dawn, listening to the relentless, rhythmic torture.

Sleep was impossible. The sounds were a physical assault, a ceaseless barrage of low-frequency dread and high-frequency anxiety. The deep, resonant thump-thump was the foundation, the bedrock of the horror. It was the sound of immense, ponderous pressure, of something massive and ancient being forced to perform a function it was never meant for.

Sleep was just a memory to my discordant mind. My eyes, I had guessed, were bloodshot and with large bags underneath them. The only thing I could think about was my new theory. My theory, which was just that, was that there was not one, but two sources of the noises. A large, deep, resonant thump and a smaller, more desperate-sounding tapping. My mind raced, trying to reconcile the impossible with the logical. The pump was a plausible, however improbable, explanation for the thump. But the tapping? The tapping was different. It had a pattern, a desperate, almost human cadence. *Tap-tap... tap-tap-tap... tappity-tap...* It wasn't the random ticking of a loose pipe. It was communication.

As the sun broached the dreary surface of the mountains, the sounds stopped. Just as before, it was as if someone had flipped a switch, plunging the cabin back into its state of malevolent silence. I didn't feel relief. I felt dread. The silence was no longer an absence of noise; it was a promise. A promise that the night, and the sounds, would return. I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to my core, that I couldn't just wait this out. I couldn't call for help. I was the only one who could find the source. I was the only one who could stop this.

I had to find the source.

I started with the most logical place. The fireplace. The thumping felt strongest there, a deep, resonant hum that seemed to emanate from the very stone of the hearth. The chimney was a hollow column, a natural conduit for sound from below. I began my search with a crowbar I'd found in the shed, a heavy, rusted thing that felt like an extension of my own growing desperation. I worked like a man possessed, fueled by a potent cocktail of caffeine-fueled adrenaline and pure, unadulterated terror. I pried at the hearthstones, my body aching, the grout cracking and crumbling like old bone. The dust filled the air, a choking cloud of soot and decades of neglect. I coughed, my throat raw, my eyes watering, but I didn't stop.

After what felt like an eternity of back-breaking labor, I managed to loosen a large, central flagstone. I wedged the crowbar under it and threw my weight into it. With a groan of protest from the ancient mortar, the stone shifted. I heaved again, my face contorted in a grimace of exertion, and the stone finally came free, crashing onto the floor with a deafening crash that echoed in the unnaturally quiet cabin. I peered into the dark, rectangular void I had created. The air that rose up was damp, earthy, and carried that same faint, metallic, and medicinal scent I'd noticed when I first arrived. But there was nothing else. Just dirt. I shone my flashlight down, its beam cutting through the gloom. It was just a crawlspace, filled with packed earth and a few rat-chewed sacks of what looked like old grain. No pipes. No machinery. No source of the thumping.

A wave of crushing disappointment washed over me. I'd been so certain. I had staked my last shred of hope on the fireplace, on the logical assumption that the chimney was the conduit. My frantic energy dissipated, leaving me feeling hollowed out, my body aching with a fatigue that went soul-deep. I sank to my knees, the crowbar clattering from my numb fingers. I had failed. The source wasn't under the hearth. The rhythm wasn't coming from below. It was coming from... somewhere else.

I sat there for a long time, my mind a blank slate, the dust settling on my shoulders like a shroud. The cabin was a wreck. The hearth was a gaping wound in the floor, a monument to my futile, desperate search. I had torn apart the only thing that felt like the heart of the cabin, and I had found nothing.

I had to rethink. The tapping... the tapping was different. It was higher, more localized. It was a desperate plea, a frantic cry for help. But where was it coming from? I closed my eyes, my mind replaying the sounds, trying to isolate them, to triangulate their origins. The deep thump-thump was the bass note, the foundation. The tapping was the treble, the melody of misery.

I stood up, my body protesting with a symphony of aches and pains. I took a deep breath, the air thick with the dust of my failure. I decided to wait until dark to start my search again.

This time, I was more methodical. I walked the perimeter of the main room, my ear pressed against the log walls, my hand flat on the rough-hewn wood, feeling for vibrations. Nothing. I moved to the small bedroom, then the tiny kitchen. Still nothing. The sound was a phantom, a disembodied presence that mocked my efforts. I was on the verge of a complete psychological collapse, my rational mind finally surrendering to the maddening, inescapable reality of my situation. I was going to die here, my sanity eroded by a sound that I couldn't find, couldn't explain, and couldn't escape.

Then, in the main room, I saw it. It was illuminated by the spectral glow of the rising moon, a single beam of light piercing through a grimy window pane. It was a section of the floor, a small, rectangular area in the corner left of the fireplace, that was a slightly different color than the rest of the floorboards.

It was a single plank of wood in the floor, in the corner of the room. It was almost unnoticeable at first, a subtle discrepancy in the otherwise uniform pattern of the aged, dark floorboards. But once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it. This single plank was... different. The wood was a lighter shade, a honey-blonde hue that stood out starkly against the dull, weathered gray of its neighbors. The grain was tighter, the surface less worn, less scuffed. It was newer. Brighter. It was a patch. A deliberate, carefully crafted patch.

*Thump-thump... thump-thump.* That noise, the tempo to my undoing, had never been so loud.

My heart, which had been thrumming with a frantic, arrhythmic panic, suddenly seized. This was it. This had to be it. My exhaustion was burned away by a surge of adrenaline, a cold, clear certainty that washed over me. The source was here. The source had been hidden here.

I grabbed my crowbar and flashlight to get a closer look. I knelt down, my knees burning, and ran my fingers over the surface of the plank. The wood was smooth, almost sanded, and I could feel the faint outline of a seam where it met the older, rougher boards. I set my light beside me. I wedged the flat end of the crowbar into the thin seam of the newer plank. I took a deep breath, my lungs burning with the dust-laden air, and I pulled.

The wood resisted. The nails holding it in place screamed in protest, their rusted heads biting into the wood. I put my back into it, my muscles straining, my face a mask of grim determination. With a series of sharp, splintering cracks, the plank began to give way. I worked the crowbar back and forth, my movements becoming more frantic, more desperate. I wasn't just prying up a floorboard; I was performing an exorcism. I was tearing out the heart of the beast.

Finally, with one last, monumental heave, the plank came free. I wrenched it from its moorings and threw it aside. It clattered against the wall, a hollow, metallic sound. I leaned forward, my breath held tight in my chest, and shone my flashlight into the dark, rectangular void I had created.

Etched into the rough-hewn joist that supported the floor, right there in the damp, earth-smelling darkness, was a symbol. A circle, with a spiral inside it, and three jagged lines radiating out from the bottom like roots.

The symbol in the woods was a marker. A boundary. A warning. And the symbol here, hidden beneath the floorboards, was the source. The nexus.

I forced myself to look closer, my flashlight beam trembling in my unsteady hand. The symbol wasn't just carved. It was stained. A dark, dried substance, the color of old blood, was caked into the grooves of the carving.

The thumping stopped.

The sudden, absolute silence was more jarring, more terrifying than the sound itself. It was as if I had pulled a plug, and the entire world had been plunged into a deafening vacuum. The tapping, however, continued. It was clearer now, more distinct. *Tap-tap... tap-tap-tap... tappity-tap...* It was coming from below.

I had to go down there. I had to see.

The space beneath the floor was a tight, claustrophobic crawlspace, maybe three feet high. The air that wafted up was a foul mixture of damp earth, mildew, and something else... something antiseptic and coppery. I squeezed my body through the opening, my shoulders scraping against the rough joists, my flashlight beam cutting a nervous, jerky path through the oppressive dark. I was in the belly of the beast, in the space between the world above and whatever hell lay beneath.

I crawled forward, my hands sinking into the damp, cold soil, my breath fogging in the beam of my light. The tapping grew louder with every inch, a frantic, metallic percussion that seemed to vibrate through the very dirt beneath my knees. I could feel it in my teeth, a high-frequency hum that set my nerves on edge.

After a few feet of agonizingly slow progress, my light hit something solid. It wasn't wood. It wasn't stone. It was a smooth, gray, unyielding surface.

Concrete.

Someone had poured a concrete floor beneath the main floor of the cabin, sealing off the crawlspace from whatever was below. A full, reinforced concrete slab, complete with what looked like a small, square metal hatch set into its center. The hatch was about two feet by two feet, made of thick, rust-spotted iron, and was secured by a heavy, industrial-looking wheel-valve, the kind you see on old water mains. The tapping was coming from directly beneath it. It was a frantic, desperate plea, the sound of someone trapped on the other side of a tomb.

I felt a wave of nausea, a hot, sour bile rising in my throat. This was no search for a faulty pump. This was an excavation.

The hole in the floor was too small. I needed to make it bigger. I went back to the crowbar, my movements now fueled by a singular, maniacal purpose. I began to rip up the floorboards, one by one, my body aching, my lungs burning with the dust and soot. I worked like a man possessed, my mind a blank slate, my only thought the relentless, driving need to find the source. The boards splintered and cracked. The hole grew larger, a gaping wound in the floor of the cabin, a maw opening into the dark, earth-smelling unknown.

The thumping faded in again and was deafening now. The entire cabin seemed to shake with each ponderous beat. *Thump-thump... thump-thump...* It was the sound of a giant's heart, a deep, resonant pulse that vibrated through the floorboards, through the crowbar in my hands, through my very bones. My mind raced to a million folkloric explanations, each more outlandish than the last. A buried giant? The heart of the mountain itself? A trapped god? I was a data analyst, a man of logic and reason, but in that moment, I would have believed any of them. The rational world had dissolved, and I was adrift in a sea of primal fear.

The tapping, however, ceased. The frantic, metallic cry for help had been silenced. It was as if the tapper gave up, and had succumbed to the relentless, oppressive rhythm.

I had created a hole large enough to lower myself through. I sat on the edge, my legs dangling into the void, my heart hammering against my ribcage. I took a deep breath, the air thick with the dust of my own destruction, and I lowered myself down, my hands gripping the joists, my feet searching for purchase on the smooth, cold concrete. I reached to open the hatch, my fingers closing around the cold, rust-spotted iron of the wheel-valve. I turned it, my muscles straining, my breath held tight in my chest. The valve groaned in protest, a high-pitched, metallic shriek that echoed in the oppressive dark. I looked inside.

There was a ladder that was caked in rust and grime, descending into a darkness that felt alive, a darkness that seemed to press in on me, to swallow the beam of my flashlight. I took a final, deep breath of the cabin's dusty air, and I began to climb down, my flashlight clutched in my teeth, my knuckles white on the rungs of the ladder.",1,1766175724.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Before I get into this deep dive (that I could honestly STILL expand upon in so many places), a huge shoutout to Dump Stat (cited in comments), which has deep dives on the history of many D&D concepts and classes. This resource helped me map out the timeline of D&D classes, which is relevant, because D&D in 1983-1987 is very different than D&D in 2025. It also helped me figure out what is and isn’t an anachronism in Stranger Things, which allowed me to ask why certain anachronisms exist in the show at all and what it might mean regarding the narrative.

As someone who has gotten very into D&D over the past year and who is now watching the show with that context, I’ve seen a lot of people ask why Mike calls Will a Sorcerer when Warlock is a much more accurate class. The short answer: it’s better for Will’s character arc. The long answer? Well…

**Dungeons & Dragons: A Quick and Dirty Debrief (from a noob)**

For those who aren’t super D&D literate, here’s a very simplified, fast rundown of the various classes that are invoked within the show and fandom when speaking about Will:

CLERIC: Introduced in the first edition of D&D (referred to as 1e) in 1973, clerics are skilled in both magic and hand-to-hand combat. They pledge themselves to a certain deity and obtain powers (especially healing powers) through their devotion to that deity. This is slightly different from a paladin, whose divine magic comes from upholding a certain oath, much like a knight’s code of chivalry.

WIZARD: Introduced in 1e as a term for a highly skilled (level 11+) member of the Magic-User class, wizards learn magic by studying. Without arcane focuses, such as spell books and staffs, they cannot cast spells. As a tradeoff, however, wizards have the most versatile range of spells in the game, and can literally alter the world around them (at a cost) with the 9th-level spell Wish. They’re not born; they hone their craft through intense study and research.

WARLOCK: Originally a term used to describe a level 8 Magic-User in 1e, Warlocks weren’t really a proper subclass until the second edition (2e) of D&D in 1990 as the male version of the witch subclass. They aren’t a standalone class until an updated version of the third edition of D&D in 2004 (3.5e.) Warlocks make pacts with powerful beings (not necessarily gods) and are able to channel their patron’s power because of that deal. Think of something similar in nature to Dr. Faustus: selling your soul to the devil in order to obtain great riches and powers when you’re alive.

SORCERER: Originally a term used to describe level 9 Magic-Users in 1e, this class is first introduced in the third edition of D&D (3e) in 2000. Sorcerers are different from all of the other spell casting classes because they do not seek out or learn magic; it comes to them. Oftentimes, they are descended from a powerful being or spell caster and gain magic as a result of that bloodline. Like Mike says, their powers are innate.

Looking at these classes, I would say that Will’s powers are closest to that of a warlock. He didn’t actively make a pact with Vecna or the Mind Flayer, but he siphons power specifically through the connection they have made with him; with what little we’ve seen of his powers by the end of Volume 1, he can only control other vessels of the Mind Flayer’s power. If he hadn’t gone missing on November 6, 1983, he would probably not have powers (according to what the show has suggested so far.) Contrast this with El and Kali, whose powers can affect anyone and anything regardless of its connection to Vecna. They are closer to being sorcerers, as their magic is the result of blood tests. In El’s case, her mother has developed these powers as well, mirroring the concept of bloodline magic first introduced by the sorcerer class. So, if Vecna and the Mind Flayer disappear, we can assume that Kali and El’s powers will remain.

With all this being said, why does Mike call Will a sorcerer when it’s both a less accurate term and an anachronistic one?

The only period accurate classes I mentioned regarding Will are the wizard and the cleric. Neither of these terms really fit him in the context of his newfound powers. Like Mike says, wizards study their magic, which Will has not done. Will is also mechanically not a cleric, because he doesn’t actively devote himself to Vecna or the Mind Flayer and pray to them for a surge of strength. It’s difficult for there to be an unwilling cleric, because they are specifically powered by their own belief in a higher power. However, warlocks are often stuck in pacts that they no longer want to uphold or that they were tricked into by their patron. Compare this to Holly, who has also been called a cleric by Mike in the show. Until Max tells her the truth about Henry, Holly believes in Mr. Whatsit and is comforted by his words, which is more accurate to how a cleric draws their power than to how a warlock draws their power. Holly is being given the illusion of choice by Henry; Will was not.

So, we’ve established that Will is mechanically a warlock. But Mike, D&D supernerd, calls him a sorcerer. Why? The narrative, of course.

**The Allegory in the Room**

Simply put, to be hive-minded is to be physically violated. We see it happen to the Flayed in Season 3 and in the visceral opening scene of Season 5. The process of being warlock-ed by Vecna is reminiscent of oral r___. Will’s journey can very much serve as an allegory for survivors of SA: his trauma responses, his heightened sensitivity, and his hyperawareness of his ab_ser’s presence are all parallels to various experiences of SA survivors. Going back to Holly and the other kids, we see Vecna gr___ing his next victims and lulling them into a false sense of security, which are also patterns displayed by predators.

Stranger Things presents multiple characters recovering from various traumas, the main two being El and Will. Trauma and recovering from trauma are central themes of the show. If you take a look at recommended PTSD treatments (see the WHO web page on PTSD cited in the comments), the common thread among them is that they are meant to give survivors a sense of control over their lives. Of course, this needs to be done in a specific way and in stages, but the ideal outcome for those suffering from PTSD is to be able to live a normal life where they don’t have to actively avoid certain triggers due to a past traumatic experience. Not everyone is able to achieve this, and that’s okay—any recovery is still recovery.

So, if we need to give Will a sense of control in order for him to activate his powers, we can’t call him a cleric or a warlock. Both of those are subject to the whims of a more powerful being (although, after seeing S5 V1, I’m personally determined to DM a D&D campaign in which the warlock eventually discovers they can mess with their patron, because that’s just… cool.) Mike telling Will that he’s more like a warlock would most likely make Will retreat from using his powers, because it perpetuates the idea that his ab_ser controls him, that he has no agency, and that if he uses his newfound powers, he is doomed to inflict the same harm onto others that was inflicted onto him. These are all narrative ideas that I think the show could still explore, but it’s vital that even though Will is using the powers of another, he is assured that the powers come from him and are his to control and wield. It allows him to break free of a victim mindset and potentially use Vecna’s powers against him.

Think about the interaction in the field. Mike compares Will to Vecna. Will describes Vecna as an “evil wizard hellbent on destroying the world.” If Mike responds to that by saying, “Well, you’re more like a warlock, because you’re actually kind of bound to Vecna and you’re, like, a vessel for his powers,” *what is that narratively doing for Will?* It’s affirming his deepest fears and traumas. It’s not allowing him to imagine a world where he can be sensitive AND strong and overcome the rhetoric he’s been fed his whole life from Lonnie, Vecna, and the society around him: that he’s weak, worthless, and unloved; that he has no power and is doomed to be a bystander and victim; that he has nothing good to contribute other than being a walking antennae for the Big Bad Evil Guy’s presence.

Instead, Mike calls Will a sorcerer. On an audience level, he’s equivocating Will’s strength to El’s, not in order to say that they’re the same or to make Will feel like a second-rate El, but because the whole party (and the GA) admires El’s strength and courage. “With El gone,” Mike says, “we could really use some magic up here.” And sure, he means literal magic! But he’s also talking about El’s immense confidence and self esteem.

To bring this back to D&D, both sorcerers and warlocks use their Charisma to cast their spells. A D&D character with high charisma is not necessarily a smooth talker or a persuasive person. Charisma in D&D refers to the assertion of one’s self. El is a perfect example of this. She’s blunt and straightforward. She’s bullied in California. She isn’t traditionally charismatic. But she is always herself, and she rarely allows others to sway her. When she sets her mind on something, she does it. This is D&D charisma.

When Will awakens his powers, he has accepted his whole self—his sensitivity, his strength, his love for his family, his queerness—and is able to use those core parts of his identity to save the people he loves. Recall that trauma recovery heavily depends on the ability of someone to regain a sense of control in their lives, and recall that the characters whose traumas are most central in their stories are El and Will. Yes, we know that El is mechanically a sorcerer and that Will is mechanically a warlock. But the bounds of both of their magical abilities rely on how concrete their senses of self are. In order for Will to gain strength through his self-esteem, he has to believe he’s a sorcerer.

**Okay, but what in the 2000s is the word “Sorcerer” doing in 1987?**

Now that we’ve established the narrative necessity for sorcerer over warlock, let’s talk about why Stranger Things would invoke and reiterate a D&D term that is inaccurate to the time period.

Mike calling Will a sorcerer is an anachronism; for those who don’t remember or know, an anachronism is an occurrence of something inaccurate to the time period in a piece of media. Oftentimes, it’s accidental and not super plot-relevant. The first example that comes to mind for me is the infamous coffee cup from the last season of Game of Thrones. This is an extreme example and an obvious goof, and it was quickly corrected once audience members pointed it out.

Anachronisms occur far more often in literature than you’d think, though. Shakespearean texts are full of them: a character in Julius Caesar, set in Ancient Rome, refers to Caesar’s “doublet” despite the fact that there were no doublets in Ancient Rome. This anachronism is probably there because Shakespeare’s company wore costumes that were contemporary to Elizabethan England, so rather than reference a more period accurate costume piece, Shakespeare decided to skip the suspension of disbelief and just call the article of clothing as it was, which was an Elizabethan doublet. Additionally, anachronisms help contextualize period pieces for modern audiences. The average member of Shakespeare’s audience was not as educated as the average member of a modern audience. If one actor pointed at another actor’s costume and called it a toga, you ran the risk of an audience member focusing on a) the fact that it was very much not a toga or b) what in the world a toga was. The anachronism is well worth the tradeoff because despite how much I’ve just talked about costumes in Julius Caesar, the plot of Julius Caesar doesn’t revolve around a toga or a doublet whatsoever. It’s a political play that’s inspired by a historical assassination. If Shakespeare does his job right, then the doublet/toga debacle is the least of the audience’s worries.

Okay, so what about intentional anachronisms? I mean, we have to assume that if the anachronism slipped the minds of the Duffer Brothers and the rest of the cast, then *someone* on Stranger Things’s enormous production team recognized that sorcerer wasn’t a period-accurate D&D term. A Volume 2 clip even doubles down on this term being used for Will. This isn’t an accident. It’s entirely intentional.

But the Stranger Things production team puts a lot of effort into trying to recreate the 80s. They have a mix of authentic vintage clothes and modern clothes that have been altered to feel more 80s-specific. The soundtrack is period appropriate, as are the nostalgic callbacks to various 80s media. So, like… why this? Why now?

For one, D&D’s popularity has increased significantly over the past several years. Anecdotally, I’ve always been into nerdy media, but I only started getting into D&D a little over a year ago. As we’ve established, D&D has changed significantly since its inception in 1974. It’s literally over 50 years old. Because the Duffer Brothers are dealing with such a long-running game that is still changing to this day, they have to balance accuracy with audience comprehension.

To demonstrate, I have attempted to cobble together what I think would be a period-accurate response to Will from Mike. The most accurate edition of D&D to the mid 80s would be the Advanced 1st edition, published in the late 70s. I scanned through the classes and tried my best to classify Will. Which of these is more compelling?

1.	⁠⁠“You’re more like a cleric, because you… well, I mean, you kind of get your powers from Vecna, but you don’t really worship him, so maybe you’re like the druid subclass of cleric. Nature’s your religion. And that nature would be the Upside Down, I guess? You’re, like, channeling the Upside Down, but I guess you aren’t trying to preserve it. You’re kind of stuck in a deal you don’t want to be part of… I don’t know, maybe you are a wizard like Vecna after all, but like, one without a spell book, and you can maybe control the undead like a cleric. Yeah… uh, we could really use some more magic around here couldn’t we?”
2.	⁠⁠“You’re more like a sorcerer, because your powers don’t come from a book of spells. They’re innate.”

Yeah, I think the accuracy tradeoff is worth it. Innate spell casters just… aren’t a thing in 1e D&D. And sure, they could have generally called Will a mage the same way they do with El, but the whole narrative point of this exchange is to differentiate Will from Vecna, and in 1e, “wizard” is just a term for a high level mage. El doesn’t need that distinction from Vecna or between innate/learned spell caster because she doesn’t really care about D&D and she can cast magic without Vecna’s influence. Will, on the other hand, *does* need the distinction. He understands that there are different sources of magic in D&D and that they thematically influence a character’s background and their arc throughout a campaign. He understands why Mike is telling him that his powers are innate and what that suggests about how Mike views him, and how he could view himself as a force against Vecna.

Secondly, I think the anachronism maybe suggests something about the plot as a whole…

**Oh my god please are you telling me this is proof of B-**

[Caleb McLaughlin voice] BYLER!!!

In all seriousness, consider about how much Stranger Things loves to toe the line between following tropes and subverting them, especially in the context of the 80s. We’ve seen this ever since Season 1, and I don’t really feel like I need to pull a ton of examples of this because they’re all over the place (think Nancy surviving while Barb dies, Steve living and redeeming himself over the seasons, Robin’s obsession with Steve stemming from jealousy rather than attraction.) There are countless pieces of media and literature that can be interpreted as queer. Certainly some of it (or a lot of it) was by accident. But certainly some of it (or a lot of it) was on purpose, because for most of history, it’s been the only way that writers and directors could safely explore queer perspectives and identities without being censored, harmed, or imprisoned. The camp of 80s media really lends itself to this, too—in the comments, I’ll link a fun article about the queercoding of vampires in cult classic The Lost Boys (which, serendipitously, was released in 1987 and features a teenage protagonist named Michael with a textual attraction to a woman and a subtextual attraction to a man. Coincidence? I don’t believe in those anymore.)

Here’s the thing: queer people have always existed. Obviously, Mike isn’t giving Will a compliment from the 2000s because the Duffer Brothers are implying that being gay started in the 2000s. But this blatant anachronism being part of a major interaction between these two isn’t a mistake. Maybe it’s completely intentional. And if it is intentional, that it could signify that Will and Mike’s relationship is meant to break the confines of 80s media. After all, the Duffer Brothers turned the queercoded character of Will into… well, a straightforwardly queer character. That’s one step. A further step would be to take the queercoded relationship between Mike and Will and turn it into a straightforwardly queer relationship. And given that this whole interaction is initiated by Mike, who (unlike Will) has not been explicitly confirmed as queer—given that *Mike* is the one who calls Will a sorcerer and therefore is the one who says something inaccurate to the 80s, *thereby breaking the rule of what is appropriate for the time period they’re in*—I think maybe, just maybe, their relationship will transcend the tropes of the 80s and become something wholly modern and unseen on a scale this large in media. And despite their bond being demonstrated through the anachronistic term of sorcerer, their love would be just as accurate to the 80s as any other ship in the show, because queer people and their joy always have existed and always will exist, no matter what the tropes lead you to believe.",16,1766175575.0,byler,3,0.95,False

1pqv8dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pqv8dq/the_cat_on_the_doorstep/,The Cat on the Doorstep,"(3,835 word count. New writer, first story on sub.) The noises were new. We closed on the house a month ago and moved in a couple weeks after that, but I was positive these were not the typical creaks and groans I’ve come to expect from the new construction. The low, disembodied howling of the winter storm outside didn’t help with my growing feeling of uneasiness. “Honey, are you awake? Do you hear that?” I whisper to my wife, gently squeezing her shoulder as she sleeps on her side, facing away from me. It’s like I’m talking to a rock. She sleeps through just about anything, and right now it makes me jealous. There it is again. That sharp, repetitive sound. Like needles being dragged across glass, along with a small jingling sound. I hadn’t imagined it, though it had worked its way into my dreams just before waking me up. It was a dream I haven’t had since I was a kid. A nightmare, really. One that I used to get all the time.

In the dream I’m a kid again, alone in my old house at night. I can’t sleep and I’m hungry, so I get up and walk to the kitchen for a snack. On the way there, I pass by the glass door that opens out to our deck. I feel something watching me from the other side as I walk, and try my hardest not to look as I hear three distinct scratches against the outside of the glass. I stop dead in my tracks, because this is exactly what Pringles used to do every time he wanted to get inside. Pringles (you should have seen his ears) was my first cat, and had grown up with me until I was nine. By that time he was around fourteen and had lost most of his hearing, and some of his vision. He slept in the garage, usually under a car, even though I had set up a nice bed for him. It was my job to let him back inside before I left for school. One morning, I forgot. My stepdad was leaving for work one day and didn’t check under the car. He also didn’t notice what he had done on his way out. I was the one who found him when I came home. I was devastated. They never could get the blood out of the concrete. It was after this that the nightmares started up. Every time it was the same. I’d turn to the door, slowly, to see his glowing amber eyes staring pleadingly at me. Not wanting to, but willed by some force outside my control, I’d walk up to the door and switch the outside light on. Pringles’ deformed body would be fully illuminated, his black fur matted with blood. He was dragging his shattered back legs behind him, and his abdominal area was flattened, organs trailing on the wooden boards of the deck. It was at this point I would usually scream for help, and wake myself up in doing so.

Sitting up in bed now, trying to forget the dream, I was careful not to move my legs until I knew where our kitten was, who sleeps by my feet every night. Though for the first time since we adopted him a few months ago, he’s missing from his usual spot on the corner by my left foot. “Maybe it’s him making all that noise.” I think, as I grope around my nightstand for my phone. I feel my hand close around it, and take it off the charger. I turn on the flashlight as I swing my legs over the bed, planting my feet on the cold wood of the floor. As I’m standing up, the phone buzzes repeatedly and my screen lights up. I squint through the blinding light to read the notifications. There are two warnings from the National Weather Service.

“Severe Cold Warning NWS: Wind chills -25 to -35. Dangerous cold tonight into tomorrow. Limit time outdoors.”

“Winter Storm Warning NWS: Heavy Snow & ice tonight- Fri., Dec. 19. 6-12” snow, icy roads, dangerous travel.”

“Fuck,” I say quietly to myself. Why did we have to move to Montana, of all places? I walk down the hallway and stairs that lead to our living room, where unplaced furniture and scattered moving boxes create a strange and unfamiliar landscape, bathed in the weak yellow of my phone light. “Baby!” I call to my cat in a high-pitched, sing-song voice. “Baby” was supposed to be a placeholder name for him while we thought of something better, but it seems like it may be sticking. No response. But I hear the intermittent scratching sound once again, coming from around the corner. It hurts my ears, the same way the scraping of silverware against ceramic plates does. I round the corner into the dining room, which on the far wall has the sliding glass door that opens out into our concrete porch. It’s there, at the door, that I find Baby. He’s absolutely transfixed by whatever he sees on the other side. I watch him as he once again begins to drag his razor-sharp little claws against the glass, the tag on his collar hitting the door as he does. I don’t know what he sees that would possibly be out in this weather, but something has him completely entranced. “Mystery solved.” I say sleepily as I bend down to pick him up. On the way back up, I freeze in terror as I catch a glimpse of what’s on the other side of the door. A pair of luminous, amber eyes, with wide slits for pupils, stare directly into mine from out of the black. My thoughts race back to my childhood nightmares, still fresh in my mind, as I try to stay rational. “That’s not possible.” I think to myself, as Baby goes rigid in my arms and emits a low growl I’ve never heard from him before. He begins to squirm relentlessly to escape my hold on him and I release my grip, my eyes still locked on the other’s, unblinking. I prepare myself to shine my light on the object of my dread, wanting only to prove myself wrong, I lift the light up towards the glass. Illuminated on the concrete below is what I knew would be waiting there. It’s Pringles. The black sheen of his coat, the dark yellow gleam of his eyes, the ears. “Wait a second.” I think to myself. The ears. They’re normal. There’s no way it could be Pringles. A wave of relief washes over me as the grip loosens on my phone and I take a deep breath. “Of course it’s not Pringles, man.” I say to myself. “How old are you now, twenty-eight?” I can’t believe I let that get to me so bad.

My thoughts turn to the poor cat, who has to be freezing to death in this storm tonight. I look into its eyes, full of desperation, confusion, and fear. I know I have to get it inside. At least for the night.

I switch the lock on the door as quietly as I can and slide it open, about a foot. A blast of freezing air and snow whips against my face and the ice, like razors, slices into my eyes. I’m blinded for a solid minute, squeezing my eyelids together hard in an attempt to relieve the sting. I rub my eyes with the back of my hands until I see spots, and then wipe the tears away before opening them back up. The cat is gone. The only traces of it left are the paw prints leading up to the patio and the small, donut-shaped indent where it curled up by the door. Something about the paw prints seems off, though. The snow already threatens to cover them up, so I quickly crouch and lean out of the door to get a closer look. It’s the toes. There’s…too many. I count six toes on each of the pawprints. I try to look at the path of them to see where the strange visitor ran off to, but the relentless snowfall has covered what’s left of them before I can tell. All that I find is a trail of small puddles leading from the edge of the doorway, right into my living room. “At least it’s inside for the night.” I think to myself. I close and lock the door, turning around with my light to look for Baby and the six-toed cat.

I begin my search in the maze that is my living room, systematically peeking in and behind every box and piece of furniture until I’ve exhausted every place a cat could fit. With no success, I figure he must be hiding in or behind some of the moving boxes (one of his favorite hobbies at the moment), and finally return to bed. It’s there I find him, curled up in his usual spot, waiting on me to join him. With a sigh, I reluctantly decide to give up my search for the night, gladly assuming my position, and wait for a sleep that doesn’t come.

I wake up Saturday morning to hear my wife already downstairs, giving Baby his breakfast. I smell ours cooking as well, something in the toaster oven, and something buttery frying in a pan. Probably eggs to go with our toast if I had to guess. “Didn’t sleep much?” My wife asks, setting my plate down as I slouch over my second cup of coffee at our table. I got a solid three hours last night, and I guess it’s pretty apparent. I smile weakly and nod. “Yeah, I don’t have your superpower, unfortunately.” I say dryly. I don’t tell her about the nightmare or the cat. I’m honestly embarrassed that my childhood fears still have such a hold on me. I also don’t want to sound crazy. I’ve decided I’ll look for it right after breakfast, while she works upstairs. She places one of her warm, soft hands on my bristly cheek. “Well, I hate to be the one to tell you, but our cars are absolutely buried.” She says with a gentle smile as I let out a defeated groan. “It would be really nice if you would help out Charlie as well. He’s been out there for at least an hour already, and his driveway looks exactly the same. I check on him every ten minutes or so, I’m worried he’s gonna keel over.” Charlie is our neighbor across the street. He’s…..well, I don’t know how old he is, really. I’m pretty sure he’s in his eighties, and lives alone from what I can tell. “Yeah I can help out. Just keep the coffee coming.” I say, bringing my plate to the sink to finish the dishes from breakfast. I guess the cat will have to wait. I doubt it’ll come out from whatever hiding spot it's found anyways. “Thanks for understanding.” She says. “I just know it would mean so much to him to have you helping out.” She gives me a short kiss on the cheek as I scrub out the pan, before heading upstairs to work at her desk.

“Morning Charlie!” I yell across the street as I work my way over the snowdrifts and brown slush the plows created. The snow is still violently whipping through the wind, which cuts through my several layers of gear like they’re nothing. I get to Charlie’s driveway to find him wearing blue jeans, rubber boots, a white undershirt, and the most moth-eaten flannel I’ve ever seen. He smiles and lets out a chuckle when he sees me, I’m guessing at the cocoon of clothing I’ve wrapped myself in. “S’pose it takes some gettin’ used to, eh?” He says, with a feeble attempt to scoop up a small pile of snow. “Yeah, no doubt about that.” I say. “It was either this, or no job. Still debating my choices on that one.” He laughs without looking up, continuing to chip away at his pile. “Well, did you bring that shovel on purpose, or did you just come over to stand there and freeze?” Charlie asks mockingly. “Not the nicest old man.” I think to myself, as I wedge a large pile of snow into my shovel. We work this way, in silence, for about half an hour. My thoughts drift to the events of last night. The cat. Did it wander off from one of the neighbors? Maybe they lost it. Suddenly, an idea pops into my mind. “Hey Charlie?” I ask, turning to face him. He stops and looks up at me, winded. “You’ve lived in this house for a long time, right?” “Sixty years.” He says without missing a beat. “I was wondering, do you know if any of the neighbors are missing a cat?” I ask. He looks back at me blankly. “A black cat. With six toes on each paw. Showed up on my porch last night.” I add, looking for any hint of recognition in his eyes. Suddenly his tired face lights up, animatedly. “I’ve only seen one cat with paws like that my whole life.” He says, and pauses to spit into the snow. “That was the neighbor’s old cat, Mittens. On account of the…” He mimes, holding up his own mittens and smiling. “Think they lost track of her in the fire a couple years back. You’d know all about that, I suppose.” I do. I remember learning about it the first time my wife and I toured the house. On the drive into the neighborhood, I noticed that all the other houses were much older construction, with ours only being built last year. I asked the realtor about it during our tour. She said the home was built on the foundation of the last one, which had burned down. Thankfully, the previous family was able to get out in time, and none of them were injured. “Mother, father, and a daughter, right?” I ask, wondering how on earth that cat could have survived two years on its own. “That’s right.” He nods slowly. “Fire happened right before Christmas. The twentieth I believe. Real shame.” He says distantly, shaking his head and remembering while he looks across the street to my house. “That little girl there loved that cat to death. I’m sure she’d be over the moon to know you saw her.” He bites off one of his mittens, tucks it under his arm, grabs his phone from his pocket with his free hand. “Here. Let me give you the mother’s phone number so you can reach out about Mittens.” He says, showing me a contact screen for “Lucy”. I copy down the number. “Uh…by the way.” Charlie says, pretending to knock the snow off his boots. “Thanks for helping me out with the snow. You never get used to it, you know. Not being able to do it yourself.” He says earnestly. “Happy to help. I needed the exercise to wake myself up anyway.” I say. We finish up his driveway and I decide to take a break to sort out the new cat issue before starting on my own driveway.

“Not the meanest old man.” I think, as I pour myself the third cup of coffee for the day. I hear my wife upstairs, still clacking away at the keys in her office. I know she doesn’t like too much noise when she writes, so I head down to the basement before I make the phone call.

The first call didn’t go through. I’m on my second attempt, pacing around the basement with my coffee to warm myself back up, when someone answers. “HELLO!” A little girl shouts into the phone, as I yank it away from my ear by reflex. “Uh…hello!” I answer in a friendly tone, now keeping the phone at a slight distance. “I’m guessing you’re Lucy’s daughter?” “That’s my mom.” She says vacantly. “Would you mind putting her on the phone for me? I just had a question about one of your kitties.” “Mittens?” She whispers solemnly. “Yeah, That's right! I was just wondering if you guys were still missing her?” There’s a solid five second pause on the other line, and I move the phone up against my ear to hear better, before she bursts out into a sorrowful wail. “I…miss…Mittens…” She gasps out between sobs. The phone is now back in its old position, about a foot away from my head. “Every…day!” She exclaims, and I hear a clunk on the other end as she drops the phone on the floor. I hear someone pick it back up a few seconds later. “Hi. So sorry about that. She’s been wanting to answer my phone for me lately. Makes her feel more like a grown-up.” A gentle voice says from the phone. “Hello.” I return. “Am I speaking to Lucy by chance?” I ask warily. “You are. Can I ask why you’re calling? What did you say to my daughter?” She inquires. I try to answer quickly, not liking this suspicion being thrown my way. “Oh, I was just wondering if you guys were still missing your old cat, Mittens? I live at the new address, where your old place used to be. I saw a black cat last night on my porch with-” “No, I’m sorry” She interrupts. “There’s no chance that was her.” She says, and lets out a long sigh. “The week after the fire, James and I had to go out to the house with the insurance adjuster to check the damages and all that. Well, after the fire, we just assumed Mittens had gotten trapped in one of the rooms and…” She stops and pauses before going on. “Well, that’s not what happened. She had made it out somehow.” “Oh good! Where did you find her?” I ask, relieved. She continues with her story, ignoring me. “Mittens spent a lot of her time outside. She had learned that if she just waited, curled up by the door, that somebody would eventually see her and let her back inside. The temperatures were a record low that week. About what they have been lately.” She adds flatly. “We walked around the back of the house, and that’s where we found her. Curled up right where the old door used to be. God knows how long she waited for us…before-” She breaks off into tears. She doesn’t have to finish her story for me to understand. Mittens froze to death, waiting for her family to return. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t know. I was just positive that-” I catch myself before I say it. “I’m sorry for wasting your time.” I finish. “No, no, it’s perfectly fine.” She says shakily, collecting herself. “I’m glad you reached out to check. I hope you can find that kitty’s home, wherever it is.” She hangs up.

I’m left loosely holding the phone in my hand, staring blankly into space as my coffee becomes cold. I know what the implications of this new information are, and I battle against my own logic and reasoning for a long time to accept it. In a last-ditch effort to disprove what I already know is true, I attempt one last complete sweep of the house for the cat. No box is left un-opened, no piece of furniture un-flipped. After 2 hours, despite my best efforts, I find no trace of her anywhere. I go through the rest of my day as normally as possible, thoughts of a stranded and freezing Mittens, of her apparition disappearing into my house, never far from my mind. I finish up my driveway, meal-prep for the week, and my wife and I watch a couple movies before we head off to bed. As I lay there staring at the ceiling, through my uneasy thoughts, I realize that I did a good thing for Mittens. Someone finally let her in. With this thought to comfort me, I’m finally able to drift into sleep.

Last night I had that dream again, the same one that tortured me as a kid. Except this time, I’m positive it will have been the last. It starts the same as it has since the first night I dreamt it, and already dread grabs a hold of my stomach as it begins to drop with the weight of my fear. I look down at my bare feet, my small hands, tracing the familiar steps that lead to the door. As I pass by it, I hear the three distinct scratches at the door. I turn stiffly and look into the glowing depths of two expectant orbs watching me through the glass. Instinctively, I start to walk towards the door and reach for the light. As my finger touches the switch, though, I stop myself. I remember Mittens, waiting for her family who never came, and how similar an end came to Pringles. He’s not here to haunt me, or remind me what I’ve done. He just wants to be let in. He wants his family, his best friend, to comfort him. I take my hand away from the switch and use it to flip the lock on the door instead. Prepared to face what I’ve avoided for so long, I slide the door open. From the shadows into the dim light of the hall comes Pringles’ head, his eyes widening as they meet with mine. I squeeze my own eyes shut, and take several deep breaths, as I wait for him to drag the lower half of his mangled body through the threshold. I feel him rubbing up against my legs, and hear one of his weak meows coming through between his thrumming purrs. After a few seconds that feel like an eternity, I slowly force my eyes open, and can’t believe what I’m seeing. Pringles is standing there, on all four legs. No blood, broken bones, not even the graying fur or cataracts from his old age. He’s a kitten again, about Baby’s age. I break into a laugh of utter disbelief and feel my eyes begin to well up as I soak up the sight of him.

I bend down to scoop him up and then carry him to my room while he contentedly purrs, his eyelids drooping with relaxation. I lay down in bed and let him settle into his usual spot, right on top of my chest, and begin to drift off. It's then, when I’m on the verge of sleep in my dream, that I awake in reality. Strangely, though, I still feel the warm and comforting weight of Pringles on top of me. I raise my head in half-asleep confusion, wondering if I’m still dreaming somehow. What I see isn’t the black sheen of Pringles’ fur, but the brown and mismatched stripes of Baby.

Instead of his usual spot, he’s decided to curl up right on my chest.",1,1766175507.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pqv7hj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqv7hj,"Nespresso Up, Two Weeks Later","Hello, coffee friends!

I posted two weeks ago that I got my Nespresso Up in the mail. I've used it at least twice a day for the past two weeks.

Before this, I used a Vertuo Plus for over a year.

My main desires for wanting to upgrade were the faster heat up time, temperature controls, and being able to change brew settings. I also wanted to be able to fit a larger travel mug without having to move the drip tray.

The Up did meet all of those expectations. I also think the machine looks very nice. It holds more water than my Plus did as well. My tall Owala smooth sip fits with a little room to spare.

However, as I'm sure you could surmise from the images on this post, the discard bin makes a big mess.

In my Vertuo Plus, the worst thing to ever happen with the discard bin is that it would be full and the next discarding pod might get stuck until you clear it. Easy. It sometimes had dried grounds in the back part but, for me, there was never pooled liquid.

The Up discard bin is a nightmare. It's ALWAYS full of coffee. It needs to be drained and cleaned every time you empty it. Multiple pieces. And, while the discard bin is pulled out, liquid drips into the spot where the bin slides in. Another thing to clean.

I'm really bummed because I do like the other features. I'm not someone who needs an app but I love being able to set it to descale from an app instead of trying to remember the right button combos to trigger it like on the Plus.

Overall, if you're looking to upgrade, I'd really weigh the benefits against the cleaning inconvenience. I drink at least two pods a day, so it fills up quickly. It's a little better if I fold up some paper towels in there to soak up the liquid, but still not ideal.

hi everyone! i hope ur all having a good day.

posted this on r/adulting and someone also told me to come on here and ask for some help! 

i’m a high school senior turning 18 this summer, and i’m looking for general financial advice as i prepare to move out and manage my own finances. i’ve been accepted to yale university and will be moving to new haven, ct (i know it's expensive there, so that's why i'm mentioning this).

my education is fully funded, and i plan to complete my undergraduate degree in biology with the goal of becoming an immunodermatologist (so lot's of school left </3).

since tuition isn’t a concern, i’m mainly looking for guidance on things like which financial accounts to open and how to set myself up responsibly early on, especially as someone who will be in school for a long time.

one of my biggest questions is whether it’s smart to work during undergrad even if i don’t need the income for the purpose of investing. any additional advice would be greatly appreciated.

**some extra info**

\- i 'm currently at an ECHS (early college high school) and graduate high school with my associate's degree (all my credits transfer, i will only have 2 years of my bachelor's degree before i graduate with a B.S. i'm mentioning this bc it means ill take lots of hard classes in the next two years).

\- i am incredibly organized and productive so i think i could handle having a job in college? however, they are more difficult courses + more hours so ofc it depends but throughout high school i managed a job, stuco president + more so i think i might be capable.

\- i plan on minoring in chem and philosophy (more crazy credit hours there..)

\- i plan on going to med school right after my undergrad.

\- i have worked around 35hrs per week (more hours over breaks) since my since 10th grade year and currently have around $25k in savings. what should i do with this..?

\- i'm at around $15 an hour now working for a coffee company and have stocks as well.

\- this figure could be higher but isn't. this is because i have pretty bad spending habits. i'm super girly and spend a lot of money on things like shoes, makeup and clothes + i go out a lot and love giving gifts/paying for strangers/etc. was wondering if anyone had any tips on this as well? kind of a problem, my collection is getting out of hand lmao 

any and all advice is appreciated so much, thank you all so much and have a wonderful day <3",2,1766175426.0,MoneyWhispers,3,1.0,False
