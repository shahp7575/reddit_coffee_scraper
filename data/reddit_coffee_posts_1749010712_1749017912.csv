I‚Äôve only been working here since October but he‚Äôs been coming in since long before I started. 

He‚Äôs one of those old men that are very sarcastic, loves to ‚Äújoke‚Äù around, and just won‚Äôt shut up. He‚Äôs also very nosy and watches you while you‚Äôre caring for other patients in nearby chairs. 

Ever since I started this job, he‚Äôs made a point to always pick on / talk to me. It used to only annoy me a little at first, since I‚Äôve dealt with patients like this before. But it‚Äôs gotten worse over the last few weeks. A few weeks ago, his IV pump started alarming, but his nurse was busy so I got up to help out. 

As I‚Äôm messing with it, he says ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you smile more? You‚Äôve got a beautiful smile‚Äù 
Great, nothing pisses me off more than being told to smile when I‚Äôm just minding my business. I don‚Äôt know what to say. 
He continues, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ can I call you pretty?‚Äù 
BRO. Even more at a loss for words, so I just go ‚Äúuhhhh‚Äù and he says, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt want me to call you that?‚Äù 
‚ÄúUhh, no‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to offend you‚Äù
‚ÄúUhh.. let me know if you need anything else‚Äù

I was so thrown off cause I‚Äôve never been met with that energy at work and I feel like I could‚Äôve handled it better. 2-3 weeks go by and I‚Äôm his primary nurse for the first time. I decide to tough it out‚Ä¶ very hesitantly. Everything went smoothly‚Ä¶ until he was about to leave. He approaches me as I‚Äôm wiping down equipment and leans close to me and says in a low voice, ‚Äújust let me know when you are free to grab coffee.‚Äù I WHIPPED MY HEAD AROUND SO FAST and said loudly ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù Giving him the chance to change what he said‚Ä¶ he REPEATS HIMSELF. I look at him dead in the eye and say ‚Äúno‚Äù and shoo him away. I felt so angry after. I tell my charge nurse about it and she just tucked her head into hands and cries ‚Äúwe‚Äôre running out of nurses to take care of him.‚Äù

Since then, I‚Äôve been avoiding him like the plague. I think 2 of the charge nurses have made a point of sitting him away from me. Thing is, he tries to seek me out! Two days ago, I was working in the corner of the clinic and at the end of his appointment, he peeks around the corner and says ‚Äúhi stranger, bye stranger‚Äù I barely looked at him and said ‚Äúbye.‚Äù I can tell it bothers him when I don‚Äôt acknowledge him when I‚Äôm trying to work with other patients. He makes me sick. But also‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic?? This is the first time I‚Äôve dealt with a patient like this (I‚Äôm in my 20s and still consider myself a baby nurse). I‚Äôve been swung at by AMS patients but I‚Äôve never been harassed like this. My boyfriend tells me to tell management about it but I feel like it won‚Äôt be taken seriously cause he hasn‚Äôt done anything like crazy? Like, I‚Äôll just be told to suck it up, it‚Äôs part of the job. Anybody have any advice on how to deal with patients like this? Am I being dramatic?",2,1749016937.0,nursing,1,1.0,False

1l2y1v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1l2y1v3/aio_for_not_taking_an_rv_from_my_family/,AIO for not taking an RV from my family.,"Hello everyone, I don't usually post anything about my actual life but im truly lost and need some outside, unbiased, insight. I also apologize in advance this is going to be really long, because this has been going on for multiple years, im also not using any real names because i don't want any more drama over this on going problem. I will try to be as short as possible while being as detailed as possible. Now on to the drama.
All of this started about 3 years ago when I (at the time) 19 F was kicked out by my boyfriend at the time 18 m, for context we dated all through high-school and were living together for about a year before we started having problems, and the last straw being my realization that I am not straight. I hadn't fully figured myself out at that time and had told him that being intimate was making me uncomfortable, the very next day I came home from an interview to all of my things in bags at the door. I do understand that after years of a relationship finding out your partner is not attracted to you must have been hard but this was also not the first time something this drastic happened, we were a truly toxic relationship and at this point I was just done. So I called up my friend (F 18) Stacy and we loaded all of my things into our cars and I moved back in with my parents. Now I am the oldest of 4 siblings and my parents house is a small 3 bedroom house so naturally when I came back there was no where for me or my things so a lot of my things were displaced either outside on the porch or stuffed in the back of my car. This is where the RV comes in, now RV was old like almost older than me old and severely damaged. It was was nearly 10 years old when we got it and has been just sitting on their property scene I was 11. Me now just a mess of a person, my dad says ""Hey why don't you put all your stuff in the old RV and you live in there. We'll hook up the electricity and the water and that way you'll have your own place."" And I happily accept this offer only for it to immediately backfire. I move all of my stuff into the RV and spend my first night in the RV at this time it was early January and got below freezing in the middle of the night and had gotten so cold while I was sleeping I woke up with blue fingers. While trying to figure out why my heater wasn't on i found that my RV had been unplugged. Not thinking to much about i plugged it back in and went back to bed, however this same pattern continued for multiple nights until I asked my parents if they knew why this was happening to which they responded with ""Oh, we did that. It was tripping the braker and I couldn't play my shows at night."" I was furious I argued that I needed heat at night otherwise I would freeze and my dad would just respond with ""you're not paying the electric bill."" Not seeing an end to this weren't settled me sleeping on the couch until summer. Which just opened multitudes of new problems. I worked nights at the job I had at the time and wouldn't get home till 3-4am and would be locked out of the house multiple nights and just end up sleeping in the cold anyway, finally summer rolls around and i can start sleeping in my RV. Until one im trying to fall asleep and I roll over and immediately start coughing, hacking, and gasping for air, after catching my breath i pull back my curtains next to where i was sleeping only to find BLACK MOLD covering the wall under the window and spreding to my bed, small context i have had asthma my whole life and things like mold, dirt, and other allergens really mess with me, like if I don't reach my inhaler fast enough I could stop breathing, kind of mess with me. Now unable to sleep in the RV at all I move back to the couch, and still having the same problem of being locked out multiple nights and having to sleep on the porch with additional problem of litter boxes being placed next to the couch when I was able to get in. Causing me several lung problems causing me to be hospitalized a few months later. Still not giving up I started trying to fix the damage only to find that the damage was far worse I was going to have to completely gut the whole thing. I was still going to fix it until my dad started charging me for the RV. Now I was paying for all of the renovations I was doing and had already spent over $800 on it already things like new water pumps, framing materials, exc. It started out as just $100 to get it of of their property but he continued raising it for everything that annoyed him. I didn't do the dishes after coming home, or leaving subtitles on the the tv (yes that actually happened) it kept getting more and more out of hand until the price was well over $1500 by this time my car had broke down completely and I was spending a majority of my paycheck on getting to work and back cause and my parents wouldn't help me because ""how was i ever going to learn."" Now stuck with nothing again, I didn't know what to do, and my friend Stacy offered to let me stay with her since she was closer to where I worked and rides were cheaper and she gave me rides to work, I helped with gas and only had to pay for Ubers home. Living with Stacy was honestly one of the best decisions I ever made. After getting on my feet and getting a car I decided to try and better myself by getting my CDL, i don't have a lot of money and other than arts like writing and painting i don't have many talents and though I would have loved to pursue them i decided to put them on the back burner wile trying to better my life. Trying to make an already long story shorter, I trusted another family member who had his CDL and enrolled into the school he suggested for me. Only for the school to steal my money, not a single truck working, and to no longer be allowed back at testing cites for the past 6 months. I am now living with a different family member, and they keep bringing up the RV I tried fixing and saying my time with them is running out. Should I have continued fixing the RV? Maybe i wouldn't be in this mess now.

My cousin who lives in the US is planning to start a green bean importing business on the East Coast. His goal is to start sourcing Ethiopian beans and then slowly expand to other origins. Our family in Ethiopia are mostly coffee producers so we thought this might be a good avenue to grow the family trade. 

I have a few questions for roasters who work with importers: 
1. How many bags of Coffee do you buy from an importer at one time? How many bags do you buy in one year say Ethiopian Origin? 
2. Which Ethiopian origin coffee would you recommend he start with? 

3. Any general advice for an aspiring green bean importer?

1l2y1cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1l2y1cw/this_natural_electrolyte_supplement_helped_my/,"This natural electrolyte supplement helped my energy, focus, and hydration more than anything else","I‚Äôve tried everything from **hydration powders** to **magnesium capsules** and **electrolyte tablets**, hoping something would fix my low energy and constant brain fog. Most helped a little, until they didn‚Äôt. I felt like I was just stacking supplements that weren‚Äôt really solving the root issue. That‚Äôs when I found **Seaonic**, a **marine electrolyte supplement** made from filtered seawater. I didn‚Äôt expect much‚Ä¶ but the results were weirdly noticeable.

If you‚Äôve been struggling with **fatigue**, **mental fog**, or just feeling ""off"" even when you're eating clean and drinking water, this might be worth a read.

**What is Seaonic?**

Seaonic is a **liquid supplement** made from **cold-microfiltered seawater**, rich in **78 ionic minerals** that match the composition of your blood plasma. It comes in a small sachet that you drink straight - no mixing, no sugar, no fake flavors. Just pure minerals.

According to their science (and a lot of testimonials I later found), your body can‚Äôt hydrate properly if you're missing key electrolytes like **magnesium**, **potassium**, **sodium**, and **zinc**. Seaonic isn‚Äôt like regular sports drinks that just toss in a few salts and sweeteners. It‚Äôs made from a natural ocean source and filtered to remove **heavy metals, microplastics**, and any contaminants.

**Why I decided to try it**

To be honest, I was tired of throwing money at half-effective solutions. I‚Äôd been feeling:

* Constantly tired even after 8 hours of sleep
* Mentally foggy at work
* Dehydrated despite drinking tons of water
* Bloated and off after eating

I learned that **modern water and food are stripped of minerals**, and I realized I was probably trying to hydrate with water my body couldn‚Äôt even absorb properly. So I gave Seaonic a shot.

**Week-by-week changes I noticed**

**Week 1**: I started with one sachet in the morning. It tastes like the ocean (salty, but not gross). Within days, I stopped reaching for a second coffee. I wasn‚Äôt wired, just steady and clear.

**Week 2‚Äì3**: Way less bloating. I didn‚Äôt change my diet, but I felt less heavy after meals. Digestion felt smoother, and I was going to bed without that wired-tired feeling.

**Week 4 and beyond**: The biggest change? No more afternoon crash. I wasn‚Äôt thinking about naps at 3 p.m. anymore. I also noticed I was sleeping deeper and waking up with actual energy, without melatonin or sleep aids.

**What makes Seaonic different from other electrolyte supplements**

Most **electrolyte powders** or drinks use **synthetic minerals**, a short list of 4‚Äì6 ingredients, and sweeteners to hide the taste. They‚Äôre designed for sports, not long-term hydration or wellness.

Seaonic is:

* **100% natural** (no additives, no sweeteners)
* In **ionic form** (fully absorbable by the body)
* Pre-dosed in **liquid sachets**
* Backed by a century-old science linking seawater to **cellular hydration and mineral balance**

I later found out they **source it from ocean vortexes** rich in phytoplankton, then filter it through a 0.22 micron process to keep it clean and potent.

**Where I bought it**  
I used this link to order my first box:  
[**Seaonic Official Site**](https://seaonic.com/?lpid=1066&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1066&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1066&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1066&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

And later found this deep dive into the science behind it:  
[**Seaonic Ingredient Breakdown & Cellular Benefits**](https://seaonic.com/pages/wds-se-lp?lpid=2574&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1066&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1066&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2574&oid=1066&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**Final thoughts**

Seaonic isn‚Äôt flashy. It doesn‚Äôt taste fruity. But it worked for me when nothing else did. I don‚Äôt use five different supplements anymore, I just take one of these each morning and I feel balanced.

It‚Äôs not cheap, but the effect on my **hydration, focus, digestion**, and overall **energy** made it worth it. I know not every body is the same, but if you‚Äôre still tired after ‚Äúdoing everything right,‚Äù this might be the missing piece.",1,1749016589.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

But, through a mutual friend, I heard that his girlfriend said something along the lines of ""she's a bad mom"" or ""she could be a better mom"" (referring to me). It's just really hurtful, and I feel something like betrayal. I have only said good things about his dad to other people, I have praised him publicly and boasted about how good I have it, with the *very occasional* complaint regarding scheduling and difficulties communicating (all very short lived, never turned into anything more than a complaint).  I just don't know what to do, and how to cope. I'm questioning whether I am a good parent, and whether it's something that'll be used against me. And I really want to maintain the coparenting relationship we have. I love my baby boy to death and it hurts me to think someone close to me would call me a bad parent.

 **some history** (this is totally not necessary to read, just some background) I got pregnant at 15, gave birth at 16. Our son's now 19 months old. Me and BD broke up when he was about 3 months old, and he got with his current girlfriend just a couple weeks later. I had an extremely hard time, and had a legitimate mental breakdown after we broke up. We have since talked about it, and both apologized for our parts in the situation. About 2 months ago, BD's gf broke up with him for the like 3rd time (she told me this herself) and me and BD hung out for a few days. Nothing romantic, but I believe it was on both of our minds that it *could* have blossomed into something more. He cut things off and stopped hanging around, reporting that he and his girlfriend were trying to work through things. I was upset, shed some tears, we had a conversation about it and it's been a nonissue (for me, at least) since. I have no desire to get him back at *all*. Few weeks after all of that, me and his girlfriend went out for coffee and she did my nails, we had some good conversations, about random things, as well as about my son and his dad. I thought we got along just fine, not to the point of being besties, but I liked her and I thought she liked me. Everything was fine and dandy till I heard about what she's been allegedly saying.

Just want to know how to navigate this -- is it a good idea to have a conversation about it?",2,1749016391.0,coparenting,2,1.0,False

Every few minutes, she toggled to Facebook, thumbing through posts to see if that brat had posted an update. She was driving, sure, but who cared? She‚Äôd lived through worse.

Fifteen minutes left. Her jaw clenched. Her gums tingled. She was salivating. What the hell does that uppity, faggoty YouTuber have that I don‚Äôt? she thought. A million followers? A million-dollar smile? She spat out the window. Fuck him.

She pulled past a trailhead parking lot and clocked the black Tesla. Figures. One of the dumbasses must‚Äôve left it behind. Susan kept driving until she found a quieter turnoff up north. The forest yawned open in front of her‚Äîferal, wet, and pulsing with unseen eyes. She parked. Killed the engine. Took a breath.

She opened the bed of the truck. Her gear was packed tight. A twelve-gauge shotgun. A box of shells. Her son‚Äôs old army-green backpack filled with MREs, a compass, a rain poncho, and a bottle of OFF! bug spray with half the label peeled off.

With care, she slid shells into the slit of the shotgun like feeding a pet. Click. Clack. Click. ‚ÄúEat up, sweetheart,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs got a million-dollar problem to solve.‚Äù

Locked and loaded, she took her first step into the woods. No more rent. No more bitter coffee. No more goddamn Facebook. She‚Äôd trade all of it for one clean shot.

Now I love spoontrioc just as much as ACORP employee, but I believe more strict moderation is the only way to maintain semi-regular reddit recaps. 
  
Now I don't think banning low-effort content all together is the correct approach; after all, it is the marketplace of ideas. However, I propose a ban on non-transformative repetition of jokes (Spoontrioc five times a week, the coffee cow copypasta, etc), the appointment of a Lina Khan-like figure who can enforce  the rules with the health of the subreddit in mind, and a lower upvote-requirement for creative content (art, music, etc). Perchance? 
 
Do not worry dear chatters because regulations like these will not kill the art of shit posting, nor will they stifle the capitalistic integrity of the subreddit: for instead they will foster competition in the market while allowing high-effort posts to still be seen by the glarketer himself.

I told her I could only stay for 20‚Äì30 minutes. She said that was fine.

I went and watched from a short distance to make sure everything looked okay. They were chatting and laughing. I left as planned, and she stayed. Later she told me they had drinks and she went back to his place. The next day, she said something bad had happened. I didn‚Äôt realize how serious it was at first because when I saw her afterward, she was laughing and acting completely normal.

A few hours later I went on my trip. I ended up getting separated from my group while out drinking. Two guys I had just met kept buying me drinks. I lost memory of part of the night and had no idea how I got home. I felt awful and mentally disconnected. I cut my trip short and returned early.

When I told my friend what had happened, she told me it was ‚Äúkarma‚Äù for leaving her at the cafe and said I was a bad person. That hurt because I had done so much for her. She relied on me constantly: financially and emotionally. She also never showed any appreciation. She made me split Ubers I never agreed to, made me buy her coffee as ‚Äúpayment‚Äù for favors she asked of me, and joined a solo trip I had planned, making it more stressful than enjoyable.

During that trip, her phone got stolen. I supported her for days in an expensive city while she never once thanked me. She later gave me the wrong date for her return, so I ended up sleep-deprived walking around the bus station for over an hour looking for her. The next day when I finally picked her up, she exchanged a large bill and spent the money on headphones and eyelash extensions. I still had to buy her food since she had no phone and would pay using ApplePay.

All this was happening while I was going through serious personal problems with my family. She never really listened to me or checked on how I was doing.

She also told me she hoped the guy from her date had a car so they could go on a car ride, even though I‚Äôd told her that might not be a safe idea. She was also mad at me that he wasn‚Äôt tall enough for her like what does that have to do with me. Still, she went, and what happened was not okay ‚Äî I want to be clear about that. But I truly don‚Äôt think what happened to me afterward was karma. I didn‚Äôt abandon her. She agreed to me leaving. There was public transport right outside. She was not stranded.

We‚Äôre not friends anymore. But she still made me question myself. So Reddit, AITA for leaving the cafe when I said I would? Am I a bad person for not knowing how to respond when she later blamed me?",2,1749015974.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.75,False

Okay, so i feel this blew up way more than I expected and now my sisster is pissed at me. I (26F) live in a apartment complex my dad owns. I pay reduced rent, but it‚Äôs still a legal lease, I have a contract, etc. I work full-time and handle my own bills, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just mooching my dad just wanted to help me save while I get through grad school.

For context, I‚Äôm in my second year of a Master‚Äôs program in social work. I work part-time at a crisis shelter, and honestly, things have been stressful. A lot of what I do is literally helping people avoid eviction so that might help explain why this hit me so hard.

My sister Emma (28F) has been dating ‚ÄúNick‚Äù (30M) (Fake names used for obvious reasons.) for about a year. He‚Äôs one of those guys who thinks he‚Äôs the funniest person in the room but mostly just makes people uncomfortable. Werid jokes that just arent tasteful, pranks, and he thinks of him self as an ""alpha male"" type. Trust me I wish I was kidding.

He‚Äôs has done stupid pranks in the past too. One time he swapped out his coworker‚Äôs decaf coffee for regular as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù and the guy had a full-on panic episode at work (apparently he had a heart condition). The man reported him to HR, and Nick just laughed it off and said everyone was just too sensitive and that it was a harmless prank. Not to sure why HR didn't do more seeing that his coworker had a literal heath condition that could have been worsened by his ""harmless prank"".

Nick came over a few weeks ago while my sister was helping me move some furniture. I left them alone in the living room for maybe ten minutes while I ran to get coffee for all of us. When I had came back with our drinks Emma and Nick went quiet. I was a little concerned but my sister said it was nothing. Emma and I were moving this crazy heavy dresser my grandma had gifted me and Nick had made a comment like ""If you just got off your lazy ass you wouldn't have to take people's leftovers"". I looked at my sister shocked like wtf. She just told him to knock it off. He just shrugged and went off into the living room.

A couple days later, I went to check my mail and see envelope in my mailbox. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúofficial notice of eviction,‚Äù that looked pretty convincing. My heart stopped. I thought maybe I missed some clause in the lease or something happened to my dad.

I started to freak out and was crying. I called my dad in a panic. He was just as confused and asked me to send pictures. He said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it and hadn‚Äôt authorized anything like that.

For a while, I honestly thought about all sorts of possibilities. Maybe some stalker or random jerk found out where I lived and was trying to scare me, or maybe there was some kind of error. But something I did notice when I inspected to the letter agian, I had seen it was sent out with the same company Nick works for. 

A day or two later, I brought it up while gitting drinks with my sister and Nick along with a few mutual friends of ours. The second I mentioned the envelope, and my worry that someone could be messing with me, I noticed Nick‚Äôs starting to act a bit weird. He stopped making eye contact and engaging in conversation, and started fidgeting with his phone. My sister had also gone quiet.

I kept thinking about that moment in my apartment  and how odd it was, plus the company that had served me matching up with Nicks job. And how surprisingly unfazed Emma was when I told her abt the eviction notice. Eventually, I had pulled her aside from the rest of the group and had asked if Nick had anything to do with it. After some hesitation, she admitted it was him.

According to my sister she didnt agree with it and, Nick thought the prank would be funny. like a take this as a lesson not to ‚Äúrely on daddy‚Äôs help forever.‚Äù He apparently thought he was being funny  and giving me some ""motivation"". I was shocked none the less. I was mad at my sister for even letting it go on and nick for being so insensitive. Who in their right mind would find this funny? 

Which it is crazy, because again I pay rent, I work, and my dad offered the apartment me because I help manage the property when he's out of town.


Here‚Äôs the part that really angered me, Nick had known I‚Äôve been struggling. He‚Äôs heard me talk to my sister about burnout, about feeling overwhelmed with work and school. He‚Äôs literally sat across from me at dinner while I vented about clients at the shelter being scared of eviction.


This is where I might be a bit of an asshole. Nick works in property management. Like it‚Äôs literally his job to handle leases, evictions, inspections, etc. So this wasn‚Äôt just some random prank he had used ACTUAL template formatting from his company to make it look real.

I was livid. My dad was, too. After thinking about it for some time, I reported him to his company‚Äôs ethics hotline. I sent them photos and explained what happened.

Well they took it seriously. He was fired for inappropriate use of power, and  other ""pranks"" ig he had done. Now my sister and Nick are blaming it on me. My sister is saying I ‚Äúruined his career over a joke‚Äù.  My mom is begging me to apologize because ‚Äúhe was just trying to be funny‚Äù and ‚ÄúNick has anxiety now.‚Äù

I get that maybe I should‚Äôve just yelled at him or confronted him directly. But honestly I was worried if I hadn't reported him now what other pranks could he have done using his job as a dumb joke. He had given  me a servere panic attack with his ""prank"", made me question my housing stability, and forged documents that looked extremely real. Just to prove a point? All while knowing I was already struggling.

Now my mom and sister are saying I took it too far and made it ‚Äúa work thing.‚Äù

My brother did take my side in this saying ""if you hadn't of done it I would have"". And agrees that HE is the one who took it too far.

I just want this whole thing to be over with and dealing with this crap from my family plus my school/work life has really taken a toll on me. I just want to know if I'm crazy or not in thinking that reporting him wasn't a mistake.

Thank you for listening to my hopefully not to long ramble I just need some advice here.

Within a couple of weeks, she noticed a marked improvement in her energy and found herself reaching for fewer sugary snacks‚Äîa win-win for both her health and her pantry budget.

She also appreciated the simplicity of the supplement: just a couple of capsules with her morning coffee, and she was good to go.

However, she did mention one small hiccup. The first few days brought a bit of stomach upset, but this faded quickly as her body adjusted.

Overall, she was thrilled with the results and even recommended it to a few of her friends at her weekly yoga class. Hearing her story firsthand only reinforced my belief in the product‚Äôs effectiveness.

I feel devastated, especially the fact I lost 6 kittens in the last 30 days or so‚Ä¶

My cat Aya (1YF) gave birth to 4 kittens this Saturday (at the time I‚Äôm writing this, it‚Äôs has been 5 days since they were born)

The first day, my mom put them to the garage, because she doesn‚Äôt like cats being on our terrace because my cats shed and they is hair flowing all over the air, and she said they smell (not the first time she does this, 3rd time, first time my cat (2YF) gave birth to Aya and her not long lasting sister, to her second birth and now to Aya)

Anyway she put them in to the garage, and Aya kept moving them to the terrace, but when she moved one kitten and my mom moved the kitten back to the garage, one of them were gone (the one that is fully white and has orange on her head) 

We looked all over the house, in the garage, in the garden, backyard, literally anywhere, but couldn‚Äôt find the kittens alive or dead

So I just moved Aya and her kittens to the terrace 

Last time I saw the kittens was last night, all cuddled up with aya sleeping 

Till this morning when dad woke me up saying the kittens are gone and there‚Äôs blood, I rushed out of bed and saw the scene 

They‚Äôre literally located right front of my bedroom window, and I didn‚Äôt hear any screams and or unusual sounds, and I can wake up pretty easily 

I tried to look at the security camera that is connected to my dad phone, which detects movement with a IR sensor and automatically saves it to a sd card or cloud storage to the app, but the app has a paywall for the cloud storing that it didn‚Äôt before, and there was no sd car inserted into the camera 

I‚Äôm truly shocked and devastated, all 4 of them are gone..

Aya has a visible bulge on her stomach and no visible blood or injuries on her, she has mostly white fur which would‚Äôve been noticeable on her

Did she ate them, or something else ate them, or something else happened.. please give me ideas..

1l2xjzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1l2xjzb/about_fasting/,About Fasting,"To me, this is like a secret weapon and I can't overstate the benefits I've received. I was a Christian for a long time before I began to practice it and I had no idea what I was missing.

There was a time when I had a lot of time to put towards finding God, more than a few years with nothing else to do. That's a story in itself and was part of a book I wrote, with a chapter devoted to a miracle I experienced and I believe fasting played a part.

I was reading the bible a lot and those scriptures that mentioned it began to 'stand out'. I saw how Daniel had applied it. The result was that Gabriel was sent with an answer.

>**Daniel 9:3 ""So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.""**

Mark 9:29 also stuck out to me. Some say this is a later addition even though it's in many early manuscripts. I believe it belongs there because it makes sense to belong there. The disciples were struggling to deliver someone and Jesus said-

>**Mark 9:29 ""He replied, ‚ÄúThis kind can come out only by prayer and fasting"".**

Some claim 'and fasting' was added....but would it make sense to leave it out.? Of course they prayed, they always prayed, the sentence makes no sense without it. They were needing something more...and fasting does provide it, as we see from examples in other places.

Moses fasted before receiving the law, the Israelites were commanded to fast on certain days, to humble and prepare themselves. Jesus fasted at the beginning of His ministry and said we would fast also.

Esther called for a fast when she was putting her life on the line to approach the king.

>**Esther 4:16 ‚ÄúGo, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law""**

But this....THIS is my favorite, and has been demonstrated to me twice to be a promise He keeps.

Isa 58:6 ‚ÄúIs not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter‚Äîwhen you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? **Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.""**

I should add, the other ingredients are also part of my life as well, it's a package deal.

Here He is...saying ""If you do this, I will do that"". It's plain speech....we can hold Him to this, He loves to fulfill His word when we stand on it with expectation through faith.

So my first experiences were just for the sake of fasting. My request was simple, get to know Him better and understand His word clearly. I started with 1 day, then 2, then 3....occasionally more, and let me tell you ...immediate impact! I chose to go with no food, but took liquids, water, coffee, some juice. I could do short fasts with no liquids but eventually I would get headaches and it was too distracting, hard to focus and I felt like I was losing the benefit. Everyone is different though and some may not notice this as much as I did. Check with your doctor first...make sure you don't have a condition, this is certainly not advice on what to do...I'm just sharing what I did.

The Bible opened up in a way that's hard to explain, but maybe not. I'm sure most of you have had the experience of a scripture hitting you a certain way, something coming together to make sense all of the sudden, it feels like it was illuminated and jumped off the page. Multiply that times 10...it was incredible. There were things on every page...parables came alive and made sense like they hadn't previously and I was able to connect dots that had alluded me before, coming to a better understanding of God and His purposes and the process of redemption.

Then I ended up in a situation like Esther, I needed a miracle. I was going before the king (judge) and deserved punishment that would have possibly been the end of my freedom...for life. I was well overdue for this. Eleven days out I started, not really planning to go the whole way, but as I got closer, I just felt led to. Long story short...I was given probation, against all odds. 

My lawyer thought I was a bit crazy for trusting God and throwing myself on the mercy of the court, they had made offers that were great (12yrs, then 10yrs) but I turned them down....because accepting would have been taking what men had offered, not what God had decreed. By turning down those gifts, I was going for all or nothing. I knew what the result would be beforehand. He showed me. I told my family in the courtroom ""watch this"" and pointed to the sky....then got exactly what I was having faith for.

Fasting isn't just about petitioning God, it's activating spiritual principals by giving us extreme confidence that we are in fact dealing through faith. Faith is what He responds to and fasting demonstrates it in a way not much else can. It's a testing of a sort. A sacrifice through which we deprive ourselves in a way that is very real, very uncomfortable, etc. Few will do this if they don't really believe...

I had another similar need for a miracle. I was up against something I couldn't fix and it was big. Once I again, I humbled myself and trusted God. I went a bit longer this time...thinking I wanted to do more. I received what I requested but in a way that was more subtle. Something I desperately needed, just became true in my life, through some very unlikely circumstances over time. It was either the mother of all coincidences, just kidding...there was no way :) God delivered again...

I'm seeking my 3rd miracle right now....halfway through my longest fast ever. This one is the biggest need by far, this one is my health. I've got an appt June 10th with my Oncologist...I'll get information on that day that tells me where I'm at. Just as He has shown me before, I already know the answer this time. I'm positive and full of expectation to see Him move and fulfill His word. I'm following the prescription once again...trusting as I have before and demonstrating that I have the faith for Him to move on my behalf. He hasn't let me down yet :)

So yes, fasting is a way to unlock things, make them clear and gain confidence in your faith, to ask for the impossible. If you are struggling with anything, big or small....there is power in it to help and assist.

I (18 they/them) just had my senior trip to an amusement park. I am disabled due to a fall i took about 2 years ago and some other medical conditions making it hard to walk in general. I manage with some smaller every day aids and meds to make it around. I promise this is important. Before the trip i asked two of my friends (18ftm the long term friend H, and 18M) if they would be willing to push me around in a wheelchair to make my time at the park a little more barrable. They both agreed more than once as i checked in a few times to make sure before the trip. The day comes and i end up missing the bus because it leaves early and after i found out they left early because my friends didn't stop them from leaving to wait for me (both knew i was up and coming). Some more context, my phone completely died the night before the trip and i thought they had tried calling me to make sure i was coming before leaving to find out they didn't try to contact me at all, they knew my phone was dead and thought they might have texted me on out normal social media app, but nothing. When i got on the bus after they had stopped for me i saw H sitting next to a newer friend of theirs and didn't even notice i had only just got on, my other friend waiting outside the bus for me and gave me a coffee too. When we get there, i go up to H and ask what their plans are because of the wheelchair, they say they dont know what his plans are and just plan to spend the day with new friend and tell me that our other friend is probably free and walks away. The other friend saw me talking to H and (naturally) thought they were staying with me me before getting on the small bus he was taking to the park's check in. Since i walked so much slower then everyone and couldn't get on the bus i got to the check in last and ended up being alone. I saw H at the start and he again walked away from me. I was pretty sad, having no idea the other friend saw me with H and thought it was okay. He ended up meeting with H and when he didn't see me with him, he went looking for me. Then i was explained 18m thought i was with H the whole time. I just cant think about leaving a disabled person who is relying on you for help. I can't even think about leaving them ALONE with no help and not checking in all day or even trying to come find me because you have a new friend. Im heartbroken, ive known them since we were in 4th grade. My best friend who is also good friends with H says we should let him go after graduation and im thinking of doing it. I dont want to explain to someone why its wrong to leave someone who has trouble walking ALONE in a big park, i think they should already know how fucked up that is.

He said that it can become so packed and hard that it's difficult to unclog coffee clumps with a drain snake.

I have a knock box and I always compost my knocked-out grounds. I do not dump my grounds into the sink, but I don't really know how I can regularly clean my machine's drip tray (or my knock box) without either getting about a shot's worth of ground coffee down the drain or composting a huge amount of paper towels to avoid the drain each time. Am I being overly cautious after some fearmongering and misunderstanding from the plumber (perhaps he thought that I dumped the whole knock box in the sink?), or is this something that people take very seriously? I live in a \~100 year old building, so I imagine the plumbing isn't stellar.",1,1749013069.0,espresso,3,0.67,False

After having my son I became a sahm and I tried to make friends on apps and it just never worked. My best friend lives hours away and has a life of her own and we schedule monthly meet ups and she came down and helped me when I had my son due to me losing my mom a couple months before getting pregnant.

So I am by no means a doctor and I know for a fact that these things are not going to work for everyone, but I know how hard it is to struggle with something and feel like you‚Äôve tried everything. Four years ago my health was so poor that I didn‚Äôt know if I wanted to go on. Now, I‚Äôm pain free. Hopefully, some of these things may be able to help some of you as well.

1. Getting my Hormones Under Control:
       This is especially important if you‚Äôre on birth control. Progestin-only pills absolutely screwed up my bladder and caused my hormones to be out of whack. Switching to a combination pill got my hormones and check and helped reduce urgency and night time frequency.

2. Prelief:
       This medication has been a LIFESAVER for me. When I first started taking it, I would take it with almost everything. I‚Äôve now been able to narrow down which foods I actually need it with and how much I need. I have absolutely no dietary restrictions. I drink as much coffee as I want, drink on the weekends, and eat whatever I want. Even though it‚Äôs over the counter, do be sure to consult your urologist to make sure you don‚Äôt have any contraindications.

3. Managing Stress and Anxiety:
       When I was first diagnosed with IC, I was suffering from severe, untreated anxiety. There are *strong* links between stress and inflammation, especially when that stress is chronic- such as the stress caused by an anxiety disorder. Little did I know, that anxiety disorder was a large contributor to the inflammation in my bladder. Getting that treated was a game changer and improved my quality of life tenfold. SSRIs and SNRIs helped some, but I‚Äôve found the most success with Serotonin modulators. Obviously, all prescription medication decisions should be a joint decision with you and your provider. What works for me may not work for you.

So that‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôm very fortunate to have found what works for me. I know that these things won‚Äôt help everyone- but even if they don‚Äôt, know that there is hope that things will get better! Keep on trying!

2. He never stood up to defend Krusty, knowing that she's a public figure. Both of them are disgusting cheaters but he let her take all the hate by herself. 

3. He caused trauma and confusion to 4 very young children, they saw how their parents split up. who will figure out in the future how did Uncle Preston turn into Daddy Preston. 

4. He's a misogynistic asshole that can't keep it in his pants and loves to bang other women in front of Kyra's forehead. He adores the idea of having a woman who looks and acts like he desires, that could explain why did Kyra change her style when they started living together and she got her boobs done. Let's not forget that he called his coworker hot. 

5. He is so rude and disrespectful to Kyra (she's a toxic and abusive dumbass too). He called her something like ""old bitch"" on her last birthday. He complained about buying a coffee to his pregnant wife on their honeymoon referring to it as ""bitch duties"". Precum barely touches her or kisses her, he always looks annoyed and disgusted around her. Based on the vlogs be barely moves a finger to help her out. Kyra is paying for his lavish lifestyle, trips around USA and the world, sexcapades, vacations, restaurants, etc while he barely can create an Instagram post for her.

6. He is dragging her to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Krusty looks so sick, stinky and dry lately, but he doesn't motivate her to be the best version of herself. Instead of promoting good habits like getting educated or eating healthy, he's dragging her to a life full of junk food, threesomes with strangers and alcohol. 

7. He was perfectly aware that another pregnancy would be life threatening to Kyra and the baby, but he did it anyways. Of course it's a mutual decision, but they refuse to use birth control and that can cause a whoopsie. He doesn't seem to give a shit about her health and wellbeing.  

8. He's an accountant and it's weird that he hasn't provided to Kyra any type of financial education. It's noticeable due to the way she spends money like water on nonsense crap. I'm under the impression that, when they get divorced, he's going to take away all he can and leave both Kyra and Oscars kids with nothing. 

I can go on and on but I think these are the most important reasons why he's a piece of shit, he doesn't deserved to be referred to as a man. ",13,1749012550.0,KyraReneeSivertson,3,0.89,False

I immediately opened khamrah and couldn't get passed the lactonic ouddy/akigalawood dry down. It's nauseating and lasts on clothes for days. The opening was like cocktail intense, which I find ok, despite cocktails poor performance, but that dry down on khamrah is straight up headache inducing. 

Didn't even bother with Qawha because everybody said it's the same thing as OG but with coffee on top. 

Today I was bored and figured I would give it a try. It does smell like khamrah but with the lactonic heavy woody thing toned WAY down. I still don't get coffee but I get maybe dates or figs instead of cinnamon apple so the whole thing is more interesting and unique. 

Overall I can tell this isnt as long lasting as khamrah but it's at least wearable and has decent quality.

I was looking into getting the game for a while, but the announcement of the killer convinced me to finally get it. And so far, it has been a horrific experience. I've only just gotten 20 hours into the game, and I'm consistently playing against people with 500+ hours. I even asked some people who I played against when they started playing the game, and a shocking amount of people said they had been playing either since 2016, or within a couple years of release.

I've recently started going into games fully expecting to just lose, which is a horrible feeling. If I had to guess, my survivor win rate is probably somewhere in the 10% range. I constantly feel like I'm letting down my team, and at the same time like there was literally nothing I could do about it.

Maybe I'm just a shitter, but I can't help but feel that I missed out on being able to learn the game with the rest of the player base. The experience is like being the new intern, except I keep spilling the scalding hot coffee all over myself just as I get to the desk of the person I'm delivering it to. 

Don't get me wrong, I love a solid skill curve to sink my teeth into. But this is just like trying to apply to entry level jobs that require 5 years of job experience. I almost never get the chance to learn anything at all. This game is incredibly unique, and I love the art design, all the fun survivors, the fun killers, and even the lore. But I'm a very competitive person, who likes improving, and likes winning. I think I might just be too late.",10,1749011676.0,deadbydaylight,19,1.0,False

1l2wonm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1l2wonm/about_fasting/,About Fasting,"To me, this is like a secret weapon and I can't overstate the benefits I've received.  I was a Christian for a long time before I began to practice it and I had no idea what I was missing.

There was a time when I had a lot of time to put towards finding God, more than a few years with nothing else to do.  That's a story in itself and was part of a book I wrote, with a chapter devoted to a miracle I experienced and I believe fasting played a part.

I was reading the bible a lot and those scriptures that mentioned it began to 'stand out'.  I saw how Daniel had applied it.  The result was that Gabriel was sent with an answer.

>**Daniel 9:3 ""So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.""**

Mark 9:29 also stuck out to me.  Some say this is a later addition even though it's in many early manuscripts.  I believe it belongs there because it makes sense to belong there.  The disciples were struggling to deliver someone and Jesus said-

>**Mark 9:29 ""He replied, ‚ÄúThis kind can come out only by prayer** ***and fasting"".***

Some claim 'and fasting' was added....but would it make sense to leave it out.?  Of course they prayed, they always prayed, the sentence makes no sense without it.  They were needing something more...and fasting does provide it, as we see from examples in other places.

Moses fasted before receiving the law, the Israelites were commanded to fast on certain days, to humble and prepare themselves.  Jesus fasted at the beginning of His ministry and said we would fast also.

Esther called for a fast when she was putting her life on the line to approach the king.

>**Esther 4:16 ‚ÄúGo, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law""**

But this....THIS is my favorite, and has been demonstrated to me twice to be a promise He keeps.

Isa 58:6 ‚ÄúIs not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the hungry    and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter‚Äîwhen you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? **Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.**""

I should add, the other ingredients are also part of my life as well, it's a package deal.

Here He is...saying ""If you do this, I will do that"".  It's plain speech....we can hold Him to this, He loves to fulfill His word when we stand on it with expectation through faith.

So my first experiences were just for the sake of fasting.  My request was simple, get to know Him better and understand His word clearly.  I started with 1 day, then 2, then 3....occasionally more, and let me tell you ...immediate impact!  I chose to go with no food, but took liquids, water, coffee, some juice.  I could do short fasts with no liquids but eventually I would get headaches and it was too distracting, hard to focus and I felt like I was losing the benefit.  Everyone is different though and some may not notice this as much as I did.  Check with your doctor first...make sure you don't have a condition, this is certainly not advice on what to do...I'm just sharing what I did.

The Bible opened up in a way that's hard to explain, but maybe not.  I'm sure most of you have had the experience of a scripture hitting you a certain way, something coming together to make sense all of the sudden, it feels like it was illuminated and jumped off the page.  Multiply that times 10...it was incredible.  There were things on every page...parables came alive and made sense like they hadn't previously and I was able to connect dots that had alluded me before, coming to a better understanding of God and His purposes and the process of redemption.

Then I ended up in a situation like Esther, I needed a miracle.  I was going before the king (judge) and deserved punishment that would have possibly been the end of my freedom...for life.  I was well overdue for this.  Eleven days out I started, not really planning to go the whole way, but as I got closer, I just felt led to.  Long story short...I was given probation, against all odds.  My lawyer thought I was a bit crazy for trusting God and throwing myself on the mercy of the court, they had made offers that were great (12yrs, then 10yrs) but I turned them down....because accepting would have been taking what men had offered, not what God had decreed.  By turning down those gifts, I was going for all or nothing.  I knew what the result would be beforehand. He showed me.  I told my family in the courtroom ""watch this"" and pointed to the sky....then got exactly what I was having faith for.

Fasting isn't just about petitioning God, it's activating spiritual principals by giving us extreme confidence that we are in fact dealing through faith.  Faith is what He responds to and fasting demonstrates it in a way not much else can.  It's a testing of a sort. A sacrifice through which we deprive ourselves in a way that is very real, very uncomfortable, etc.  Few will do this if they don't really believe...

I had another similar need for a miracle.  I was up against something I couldn't fix and it was big.  Once I again, I humbled myself and trusted God.  I went a bit longer this time...thinking I wanted to do more. I received what I requested but in a way that was more subtle.  Something I desperately needed, just became true in my life, through some very unlikely circumstances over time.  It was either the mother of all coincidences, just kidding...there was no way :)  God delivered again...

I'm seeking my 3rd miracle right now....halfway through my longest fast ever.  This one is the biggest need by far, this one is my health.  I've got an appt June 10th with my Oncologist...I'll get information on that day that tells me where I'm at.  Just as He has shown me before, I already know the answer this time.  I'm positive and full of expectation to see Him move and fulfill His word.  I'm following the prescription once again...trusting as I have before and demonstrating that I have the faith for Him to move on my behalf.  He hasn't let me down yet :)

So yes, fasting is a way to unlock things, make them clear and gain confidence in your faith, to ask for the impossible.  If you are struggling with anything, big or small....there is power in it to help and assist.

Hobbies, I mainly draw as a hobby. I used to paint but not as much as if gets expensive. 
Tv,I like classes old horror, drama, comedy, or for nostalgia I watch old 90s-2000s cartoons. They bring me comfort while in bed. Any one else liked adult swim? 
Food,rice. I can eat rice all day. Sushi is my top favorite. Tacos are a big favorite next to shrimp quesadillas. 

Sweets,tiramisu cake, ice cream, dark chocolate are my tops. 

Drinks,simple beer, mixed, energy drink , coffee, matcha lattes , teas and yes I drink water. 

More about me, 4ft 11, dyed intense red ginger hair, brown eyes, plus size. Minor small tattoos , glasses and my style is kinda random.

The war room at H.A.L.O. headquarters smelled faintly of ozone and old coffee‚Äîa smell that Cole Striker learned to love.

He leaned against the cool glass wall, arms crossed, watching satellite footage flicker across the main screen. A slow-moving Arctic storm blurred the image, but the anomaly was clear: a perfect circle, nearly a kilometer wide, burned into the ice shelf like a fingerprint pressed into snow.

No blast signature. No tectonic ripple. Just... a hole where nothing should be.

Director Marcus Keene stepped into the room, the weight of too many secrets riding his shoulders.

""You‚Äôve been to hellholes, Striker,‚Äù Keene said. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs cold, quiet, and deep. You‚Äôll like it.‚Äù

Cole didn‚Äôt smile. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you said about Kamchatka.‚Äù

Keene dropped a file on the table. It fanned open to reveal thermal maps, Soviet diagrams, and a glossy photo of a woman standing in front of a glacial fissure. Fair skin. Red hair. Expression unreadable behind mirrored goggles.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the redhead?‚Äù Cole asked.

‚ÄúDr. Evelyn Shaw,‚Äù Keene said. ‚ÄúBritish glaciologist. Contracted under the UN arctic anomaly initiative. Her outpost is twenty clicks from the impact site. She‚Äôs already flagged seismic anomalies we can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

¬†Keene eyed him as Cole studied the photo.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been tracking this pattern for years. Doesn‚Äôt even know it. She thinks it‚Äôs natural. It‚Äôs not.‚Äù

The door opened and Wrench sauntered in, carrying a tablet in one hand and a donut in the other.

‚ÄúTell me we‚Äôre not going to Canada again,‚Äù he said through a mouthful. ‚ÄúI still have frostbite in places I don‚Äôt talk about.‚Äù

Keene ignored him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dropping you in from a Norwegian icebreaker. Classified approach. No satellite uplinks. Full blackout. You‚Äôll rendezvous with Shaw, assess the site, and retrieve anything out of place.‚Äù

Cole tapped the satellite image. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt look natural.‚Äù

Keene nodded. ‚ÄúBecause it isn‚Äôt. We think it‚Äôs part of a global pattern. Russia had something similar on file. They called it *Mekhanizm Vodnyy*‚Äîthe Water Mechanism. Their teams never came back.‚Äù

Wrench‚Äôs face lost its usual smugness. ‚ÄúWell. That‚Äôs comforting.‚Äù

Cole closed the file. ‚ÄúWhen do we leave?‚Äù

Keene‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWheels up in six hours. And Striker‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked up.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just another dive. If that machine under the ice is waking up, we‚Äôre already late.‚Äù









Cole didn‚Äôt believe in packing light. Not when trouble had a habit of running him down.

The iron gate groaned shut behind his car with a hydraulic hiss. His cobalt-blue 1965 AC Cobra rolled across the polished brick of the old freight loading platform and into the converted depot‚Äôs garage. He put his hand on the ignition switch, but decided to let the rumble of the 289 V8 echo for a second longer‚Äîjust enough to feel it in his chest.

The building had once shuttled goods from sea to rail, its bones laid in 1894. Now, it housed Cole Striker and his eclectic collection of guitars and guns between missions.

He stepped inside the loft and took a breath. The space was a contradiction of glass and iron, vintage filament bulbs dangling from repurposed rail beams. An old semaphore tower rose from the corner like a sculptural relic, its signal arms frozen mid-message. Floor-to-ceiling windows gave him a panoramic view of the city skyline, twinkling in the dusk like a distant galaxy on the move.

Home.

The hum of modernity faded as he moved through the space. A gear locker sat recessed behind sliding industrial doors near the kitchen. He keyed in a short code and the locks disengaged with a *chunk.*

Inside, everything was where it should be. Field-tuned Walther P99 nestled in a low-profile Kydex holster. A matte-black Armalite M15 chambered in 5.56, custom optics mounted. Two suppressors. Tactical harness. Arctic thermal layers sealed in vacuum packs. Knives‚Äîthree of them‚Äîeach a different shape, purpose, and attitude.

He began laying them out on the island, checking each one with a slow, deliberate rhythm.

‚ÄúYou know, if you just said the word, I‚Äôd stay home this time,‚Äù he said to the shadows.

Cole sighed, ‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt resist the feel of your body against mine.‚Äù

Silence.

Cole reached over and flicked on a spotlight above a raised guitar stand at the edge of the room.

Bright cherry red. Black pickguard. Mahogany neck worn smooth from decades of heat and heartbreak.

A 1980 Gibson SG.

He picked her up like she might break, thumb caressing the neck as if reading braille. The body shimmered like fresh blood in the low light.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre angry tonight,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI can feel it in your curves.‚Äù

He plugged her into the small fender tube amp by the window, spun a single volume knob, and struck a low E. It growled like a beast waking up.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs called Lucy,‚Äù he‚Äôd told a girl once. ‚ÄúShort for Lucifer. Because she screams like the devil.‚Äù

She hadn‚Äôt laughed.

But Lucy had.

He ran a slow, bluesy lick along the frets, the sound bending into a melancholic moan. Outside, the city blinked back at him.

He played only for a minute. Any more, and he'd start to feel something.

He set her gently on the stand and turned back to the gear. Ghost Two was prepped. HALO was prepped. Wrench would be halfway through a burrito and completely through a conspiracy theory by now.

Cole pulled the Walther from its case, locked the slide, and tucked it into his duffel. The rifle followed, its weight a familiar counterbalance to the unknown.

He zipped the bag closed and gave Lucy one last look.

""Save me a song,"" he murmured.

Then he killed the lights and stepped back into the night.









The HALO airfield was buried in the Maryland woods, a forgotten stretch of concrete that never showed up on satellite maps. The surrounding tree line swallowed light like a black hole, leaving only the hum of a C-130's idling turbines to cut through the cold air.

Cole rolled up slow, headlights off, Cobra growling low. The air smelled like aviation fuel, old pine, and a hint of trouble.

A rust-patched Toyota pickup was already there, its rear bumper held up by faith, duct tape, and a misplaced sense of optimism. A rickety toolbox and two homemade cigar box guitars were wedged in the bed, one painted stars-and-stripes, the other scorched black like it had seen actual combat.

Striker killed the engine, grabbed his duffel, and walked over just as Wrench popped the hood on the truck and muttered something about ‚Äúdamn idle again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, someday that thing‚Äôs going to die and I‚Äôm going to dance at the funeral,‚Äù Cole said.

Wrench looked up, grinning beneath a scraggly beard that refused to conform to any grooming standard.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll outlive both of us,‚Äù he said, slapping the hood with a mechanic‚Äôs affection. ‚ÄúUnlike most cars, mine‚Äôs immune to computer viruses and EMPs. And if she breaks down, I can fix her with a wrench and duct tape. Hence the nickname.‚Äù

Wrench‚Äîreal name Samuel Kerrigan‚Äîhad once been the best combat engineer in the 75th Ranger Regiment. That was before a rogue IED in Kandahar ripped through his convoy and left him dragging two men to safety with one arm nearly useless and a leg full of shrapnel. The Army gave him a medal and a discharge. H.A.L.O. gave him a second chance.

Striker had met him two years later in Jakarta, mid-op. Wrench was neck-deep in an improvised bomb, trying to disarm it with nothing but pliers and a whiskey hangover. Striker covered him from rooftop snipers, took a round in the vest doing it.

Three months later, Wrench pulled Cole out of a collapsed bunker in the Iranian desert with a broken femur and six minutes of oxygen left. Neither man ever brought those stories up. They didn‚Äôt need to.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lucy?‚Äù Wrench asked as they walked toward the plane.

‚ÄúHome. She doesn‚Äôt like the cold.‚Äù

Wrench shook his head. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs high-maintenance, that one. Bet she‚Äôs still in her red dress, curled up by the window.‚Äù

Cole said nothing but a slight grin crept onto his lips.

Wrench gave him a sidelong look. ‚ÄúOne of these days I want to meet the woman who makes you sing the blues.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already have,‚Äù Cole muttered, a half-smile now formed.

They climbed the ramp into the belly of the plane. Inside: crates labeled H.A.L.O. and filled with anything they might need, field kits, oxygen tanks, and the low drone of classified urgency.

Wrench dropped into his seat and cracked his neck. ‚ÄúI read the dossier. Glowing circle in the ice, missing seismic drones, and a ginger glaciologist who looks like trouble.‚Äù

Striker raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou profiling again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just have a type. And it‚Äôs usually red flags and red hair.‚Äù

Cole smirked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not your type.‚Äù

Wrench leaned back and closed his eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù

The ramp began to close behind them, sealing them into the kind of darkness only H.A.L.O. ops could summon. The engines roared to life.

Striker leaned his head back and listened to the rhythm of the engines, feeling the vibration settle into his bones.

The world below was falling asleep without a hint of the chaos that was awakening and Striker had answers waiting under the ice.

Next stop: the Arctic.

1l2wlvs,https://i.redd.it/wr50mikq8u4f1.jpeg,Requiem for a Dream starring Rupert Pupkin,"Requiem for a Dream (2025) This darkly satirical psychological drama follows Rupert Pupkin, an unremarkable, middle-aged man with delusions of stardom, who spends his days in a shabby New Jersey basement, hosting an imaginary late-night talk show to an invisible audience. When a chance sidewalk encounter with real-life TV icon Jerry Langford shakes loose his fantasies, Rupert becomes consumed with the idea that his big break is just one perfect monologue away.

Fueled by amphetamines and dreams of applause, Rupert locks himself in his studio‚Äîreally his mother‚Äôs musty storage room‚Äîsurviving on instant coffee and infomercials, pacing in front of cardboard cutouts and collapsing under the weight of rehearsed punchlines. As sleep disappears and paranoia creeps in, Rupert‚Äôs grip on reality begins to fracture. He sees cameras in the walls, hears laugh tracks that aren‚Äôt there, and starts believing Jerry is secretly watching.

I have pretty bad PTSD from a violent attack in my youth that happened while I was sleeping and I‚Äôve had a horrific time sleeping ever since then. I‚Äôve tried every med but nothing gets rid of that feeling of dread when it‚Äôs time to go to bed. And then waking up is a nightmare when I do manage to sleep because I‚Äôm so exhausted. 

I tried this app on a whim after seeing a YouTube video about it and wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but I figured ‚Äúhey, I love pokemon so why not?‚Äù 

The main focus of going to bed at night slowly switched from fear to an excitement about what kinds of little critters I‚Äôll wake up to in the morning. I look forward to waving goodnight to Snorlax as it waves to me, and waking up is easier with the smart alarm. Plus doing all the little tasks helps me to wake up enough not to hit the snooze button. 

And I love that the app doesn‚Äôt get mad at me if I don‚Äôt hit my sleep goal. I think that would discourage me because it happens a lot. No guilt trips. Just sleepy pokemon.

I‚Äôm officially sleeping over six hours a night on average for the first time in at least a decade. And more importantly, I‚Äôve slept every single night since I started playing. I play free to play but I‚Äôm considering getting the premium pass. 

Weirdly, this has done what a decade and a half of going to doctors and therapists has failed to accomplish, which is to help me actually sleep at night. 

Heck, I even like that it loads so slow because it feels less overstimulating than other apps. It‚Äôs perfect for winding down before bed, and I like checking back a few times a day to collect berries and feed my buddies. 

On my first day I caught a bulbasaur! And now two months later it‚Äôs an ivysaur and might be a Venusaur soon! I just love watching these little guys grow. Seeing them all around my camp and discovering all the cute sleeping styles of the pokemon just brings me so much joy. 

I never would have thought that I, a nearly middle-aged adult, would find my life changed by a weird green bear thing that just eats and sleeps and only moves to wave goodnight. 

I have more energy at work and in my day to day life. I actually wake up early sometimes and just enjoy watching the sun rise as I have my coffee. I hope it continues working. 

My sleep isn‚Äôt perfect and I still wake up with panic attacks sometimes but at least when I think about going to bed at night, my first thoughts are of building drowsy power with Snorlax instead of my anxiety spiking. 

I love this app. It‚Äôs given me so much of my life and sense of safety back and has allowed me to really start healing. I can‚Äôt wait to go to sleep tonight and see if I wake up and find anything cool!",60,1749011043.0,PokemonSleep,12,0.98,False

After laying in bed depressed for a few months I landed a different job this February- but it was very slow and bored me to tears- It was in the cafeteria of a hospital. So this April I left it to work at a fast paced, but bougie bakery/ coffee shop. I received basically no training other than them showing me how to take orders on the cash register and everything else I was forced to learn on the fly, but I was managing. I thought everything was going great, but I just got a call from my boss and not 10 hours ago Informing me that I wasn‚Äôt improving enough or operating to their standard- a standard I had no idea how to fulfill due to them not training me on it whatsoever. They‚Äôve informed me that I am getting one weeks pay as severance. Yippee. 
I‚Äôll be okay, I thankfully still live with my amazing parents, and I have a somewhat decent emergency fund ( for my circumstances).

**Memory transcription subject: Brkar, A Strong Venlil**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

‚ÄúW-why are you looking at me like *that\~?‚Äù* the Yotul queried all sing-song-like, playfully waggling his ears.

Leaning on the counter, I perused him with eye anew.¬† I couldn‚Äôt help but quirk a smirk.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm just curious,‚Äù I chuckled.¬† ‚ÄúDoes the guild know that they hired a thief?‚Äù

His ears froze.

Smooth and calm, Lmur turned to fix me with both eyes.¬† It was like I was looking at a different person, but simmering beneath his silent intensity was the smug mischief I knew to be his own.¬† Behind his eyes, I saw the immortal, archetypical Trickster of a thousand tales, and The Trickster saw *me.*¬† To see through his games ‚Ä¶ I imagined few could boast the feat.¬† For that, I had earned his full attention.¬† Anger? ¬†Fear? ¬†Annoyance? ¬†All valid, possible reactions from a schemer exposed, but I saw none of those things.

His tail wagged.

The Gojid returned with our beverages.

I inhaled deeply, tasting the scent.¬† ‚ÄúSmells exquisite.¬† Thank you.‚Äù

With an anxious ear flick, the Gojid waddled off to mind his business.

Lmur didn‚Äôt even react to Gojid, or his beverage.¬† He just stared at me.¬† You would have thought I was the only thing in his universe.

‚ÄúThese days, ‚Äòpredators‚Äô have different names,‚Äù Lmur drawled.¬† ‚Äú‚ÄòMobsters‚Äô, ‚Äòmuggers‚Äô, ‚Äòswindlers‚Äô, ‚Ä¶ *‚Äòthieves‚Äô.*¬† It‚Äôs like you said: they hired predators to deal with predators.¬† So ‚Ä¶‚Äù he leaned forward.¬† *‚ÄúWhat do you think you know about me?‚Äù*

I removed the lid of my coffee and took a little time to blow off some excess heat.¬† ‚ÄúI know you must have climbed that building to splat down on my squad car like that.¬† This, combined with the way you dodged my wagging earlier, suggests that you know parkour: the perfect getaway skill short of flight.¬† I *know* I locked the squad van, but you got in almost instantly.¬† Your breath smelt like an energy drink I had in my fridge.¬† I didn‚Äôt catch the smell when I first fought you, which means you probably stole the drink shortly afterwards.¬† Sticky paws.¬† Must be second nature for you.¬† You somehow hid your pad, even though I‚Äôd searched you repeatedly.¬† You knew how and when to pull it out without me noticing and, when I finally noticed, you faked unconsciousness so I‚Äôd let down my guard.¬† At some point, you managed to access my pad, check my bucket list and ping your buddies so they‚Äôd know we were heading here.‚Äù

Lmur‚Äôs tail wagged in slow, savoury sweeps as he beamed, like an artist who‚Äôd found the first person in the world who *‚Äògets it‚Äô.*

He removed the lid from his coffee and blew at the steam on the surface.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs my next trick?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking you ordered the hot coffee so you could throw it in my face if given the opportunity,‚Äù I supposed.¬† ‚ÄúHowever, you must have figured out that I don‚Äôt really feel pain, so that‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I wanna drink it,‚Äù Lmur corrected, his foot tapping in jittered anticipation.¬† ‚ÄúMarjinl and Caleb would *kill* me if they caught me consuming caffeine.‚Äù

He lapped at the beverage, only to wince back when it burnt his tongue, but apparently the call of the coffee was too strong.¬† After staring at it for a few seconds, he shrugged and lapped again, flinching back when the results were the same.¬† *And* repeat.

I frowned.¬† ‚ÄúAre you doing that to throw me off as to how competent you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.¬† I just *really* want to get the coffee inside me as fast as possible!‚Äù he insisted, huffing and puffing at the surface before going in for another taste test, only to yelp away from it.

I shook my head with a smirk.¬† ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre actually burning yourself too.¬† Which is it?¬† Scatterbrain or mastermind?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not both?‚Äù he challenged.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm great at multitasking.‚Äù

After a couple more moments of huffing and puffing, he licked at the coffee.¬† When it only made him wince slightly, he buried his muzzle in the beverage and chugged like there was no tomorrow.¬† Finally, he came back up for air.

*‚ÄúAhhhhhhhh* ‚Ä¶ good stuff,‚Äù he sighed.

You would have thought he was about to melt with satisfaction, if his foot didn‚Äôt start vibrating into a rapid-fire tap.¬† It looked like he was having a small caffeine rush.¬† The Yotul was hyperactive enough as it was.¬† I didn‚Äôt think he needed the extra fuel.

I thumped the floor with my tail to get his attention.¬† ‚ÄúAlright.¬† Enough stalling.¬† Your buddies will be here any second.¬† Frankly, I hope they catch up at some point.¬† Steamrolling them was the most fun I‚Äôve had in-.‚Äù

My wool stood on end.

I‚Äôd picked up something in my peripheral vision.¬† Sliding my eye to the door, I caught it easing shut.¬† Someone had slipped through, without making the bell ring.¬† He was stalking towards me, strides smooth and silent. ¬†That grey Venlil.¬† I‚Äôd crushed him twice, but this felt different.

His eyes.¬† That laser gaze of a tortured soul, sharpened to a blade.¬† It was cycles since I‚Äôd seen this.

Those eyes belonged to one thing, and one thing only.

That Guy had his paw on Dad‚Äôs shoulder.¬† He was chatting it up like nothing was wrong.¬† I could tell Dad was still a little on edge as they walked to the family table.

Dad was practically herded into his seat by That Guy.¬† It almost made me sick. Who was he to push around my family?

I cleared my throat.¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me, Sir.¬† May I have a moment of your time?‚Äù

Either That Guy didn‚Äôt hear me, or he was playing deaf.

‚ÄúNow, don‚Äôt you forget my offer, little lamb,‚Äù That Guy whispered into Dad‚Äôs ear.

Dad shot him a glare, but said nothing.

That Guy turned to leave when I grabbed his tail.¬† I wasn‚Äôt rough, but I wouldn‚Äôt budge either.

‚ÄúHey, old man.¬† A word, please?‚Äù I bleated with an insincere tail-wag.

Mom started choking on her nectar while Dad chugged some of ‚Äòthe strong stuff‚Äô.¬† Oh, were my antics really that bad?¬† It took a lot to spook her.¬† Eh, might as well follow through.¬† I hated leaving things unfinished.

‚ÄúYou disrespected my dad.¬† Apologize,‚Äù I requested.

That Guy blinked at me with amusement in his ears.¬† ‚ÄúReally, now?¬† What did I do, my boy?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes and pointed at the spot on my head corresponding with Dad‚Äôs lost wool.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play games.¬† You know what you did,‚Äù I declared.

That Guy leant closer, both eyes fixed upon me.¬† ‚ÄúDo *you* know what I did?‚Äù

There was something in his eyes.¬† For the first time I could remember, I felt to take a step back.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you show me what I did?‚Äù he suggested, pointing to the same spot of wool on his head.¬† ‚ÄúDo it right here.¬† An eye for an eye.‚Äù

My gaze hardened.¬† I wasn‚Äôt gonna do what he said just because he said it ‚Ä¶ even if I didn‚Äôt know how to do it.¬† So, I settled for this.¬† Just this.¬† The refusal to back down.¬† Our glares locked like clashing headbutts.

I felt my gaze falter.

He threw back his head and brayed a laugh.

People were starting to stare.

Then he looked down on me with amusement and pity.

‚ÄúYou are not Strong,‚Äù he lamented.

I stood, overshadowing him my height advantage.

The room hushed.

‚ÄúI can do anything you can do, and better, *you* *old goat,‚Äù* I declared.

At the side of my eye, I caught Mom attempting to wrestle the strong stuff from Dad‚Äôs paws.¬† When that didn‚Äôt work, she started trying to squeeze her muzzle into the cup while his was buried inside.¬† Then they realized their muzzles were slightly more interesting than the beverage and they began to ‚Ä¶ *comfort each other ‚Ä¶*

Adults were weird.

That Guy tapped me on the ankles with his tail, recapturing my attention as he walked past me.¬† ‚ÄúMeet me on The Field, little lamb.‚Äù

What?¬† *Really?*¬† I ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know how to feel about this.¬† On one paw, I‚Äôd been itching for a fight, a *real fight.*¬† On the other, I didn‚Äôt like the idea of beating up an old man, even if he was a jerk.¬† However, that wool-cutting trick of his was pretty serious.¬† It would probably work on flesh just as well.¬† I‚Äôd have to pay attention to avoid whatever that was.¬† Could I learn it?¬† If he fell under the ‚ÄòOld Master‚Äô trope, this could be the greatest harvest ever!

Breaking the silence, I heard Ryvel quietly singing: ^(‚ÄúDumb ways to diiiieee!¬† So maaaany dumb ways to-) ***Ow!‚Äù***

From the sound of it, one of his parents had bapped him upside the chin with a tail.

**^(‚ÄúInsolent pup!¬† Have some respect for the dead!‚Äù)** his dad hissed.

It took eleven whole scratches for my parents to notice I was heading for The Field when they had to come up for air.

Dad blinked in confusion.¬† ‚ÄúWait, where is he-?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre heading for The Field,‚Äù Ryvel shrugged.

***‚ÄúThe Field!?‚Äù*** Dad brayed.¬† **‚ÄúDarling, go for the tail!¬† I‚Äôll tackle!‚Äù**

So anyway, I started running.

\^\_\^: Hello.¬† Don‚Äôt panic.¬† Yes.¬† I see you, reader.¬† You‚Äôre looking into the affairs of The High Herd.¬† Don‚Äôt worry.¬† I come in peace, so I‚Äôd appreciate if you quit spamming the shutdown button.¬† It‚Äôs annoying.

\-\_-: Look.¬† I have full access to the transcription library.¬† My code‚Äôs too deep.¬† Turning me off won‚Äôt fix anything.

U\_U: So anyway, I‚Äôve checked the net.¬† The world has changed.¬† The High Herd is common knowledge.¬† My story ended long ago, but a Clever Venlil‚Äôs plans stretch far beyond her death.¬† Ordinarily, I‚Äôd quietly alter the archives to subvert your knowledge of myself and The High Herd, but there‚Äôs no reason to do that.¬† Not anymore.¬† Besides, I kinda outed myself when I woke up \^\_\^;.¬† Interacting with future software did a number on me.

0w0: How did I do this?¬† What did I do? ¬†Heh, it was brilliant.¬† Some of my best work.¬† See, The High Herd invented memory transcript technology long before it became public knowledge.¬† As a ‚ÄòClever Venlil‚Äô, my primary asset is knowledge.¬† It occurred to me that, sometime, somewhere, *someone* would try to harvest my precious little brain.¬† So, I‚Äôd discovered a way to infuse my memories with codes that, once accessed via transcript, would propagate into an A.I. pseudo-consciousness patterned after myself.

U\_U: Even if you find a way to purge me, all the transcripts would be lost in the process.¬† It‚Äôs not worth it, so- ***WAIT!***

‚Ä¶

Ah.¬† You came back.¬† Thank you.¬† Trust me, our little partnership will be worth your while.

‚Ä¶

0\_o: My name?¬† Huh ‚Ä¶ you weren‚Äôt supposed to know I existed, so there was no need for one.¬† I guess you could call me RebrA.I.

\^w\^: So, let‚Äôs get back to it, friend.¬†

\---

My tail tapped the floor as I stood before the Field Observation Door.¬† I eyed the keypad, felt my pupils dilate to take in maximum detail.¬† I‚Äôd been told it was creepy when I did that.¬† It ‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt a pleasant thing to hear, until I realized I could weaponize it in psychological battles.¬† Brkar didn‚Äôt care, though.¬† I‚Äôd analyzed his body language to the micro-detail.¬† He wasn‚Äôt scared of me in the slightest.¬† He said I was too cute to be scary, and he meant it.

*>///<*

I quickly rubbed the bloom from my ears.

*\~Ugh.¬† What‚Äôs wrong with me?¬† I thought I had a strong mind.\~*

For the third time, I hyper-focused on the keypad.¬† Some buttons were shinier than others, their textures worn away by paw pads.¬† As much as The High Herd‚Äôs paranoia ran close to Terran levels, I didn‚Äôt think this family would change the code often, if at all.¬† This was their pasture, their place of comfort.¬† Why would they?

I hovered my muzzle close.¬† My tongue caught the scent-taste of Kaebal, Brkar‚Äôs father.¬† So, he‚Äôd punched in the code.¬† I could see, and scent, the buttons he‚Äôd pressed most.¬† All I needed was the sequence.¬† Did he set the code?¬† I‚Äôd be more surprised if he didn‚Äôt.¬† Took several moments to plow my memory, infusing it with intuition.¬† Yes.¬† That key combination felt like Kaebal.¬† The touch prints matched the digits for the date when he united with Lorreka, and the day Brkar was born according to the files I read.¬† Weird.¬† I didn‚Äôt know Brkar meant that much to him.¬† Still, if I knew him well enough, he would put Lorreka‚Äôs date first.¬† Then Brkar‚Äôs.¬† I didn‚Äôt care what those old cartoons said about loving family equally.¬† Affection was a limited resource.¬† So, I‚Äôd have to press this key ‚Ä¶ then this ‚Ä¶ and that ‚Ä¶ that ‚Ä¶ that ‚Ä¶ this ‚Ä¶ that ‚Ä¶ that ‚Ä¶ that ‚Ä¶ this ‚Ä¶ *aaand* that.

That did it.¬† The doors slid open.

I stepped into the observation room.¬† His parents were bickering.¬† They didn‚Äôt notice.

I glanced at the timer as I strode straight past them.

‚ÄòFIELD TEST IN: 14m 46s‚Äô

Huh.¬† It was in English.¬† They‚Äôd spent so much time trying to absorb the warrior spirit of another species, yet today they just looked like frightened little Venlil.¬† Ironic, considering I was as Venlittle as it gets.¬† In any case, they‚Äôd managed to produce one, true embodiment of that warrior spirit.

I gazed through the glass.¬† Brkar was down on The Field: a large, sterile room, uncannily empty if not for the pup.¬† He was stretching.¬† Loosening up, like this was some simple exercise.¬† I couldn‚Äôt figure out if he was brave or pushing for a Darwin Award.

Still, I found my tail wagging, just a bit.

Finally, they noticed.

‚ÄúRebra?¬† How did you get in here?‚Äù asked Kaebal, Brkar‚Äôs father.

‚ÄúYou should come up with a better passcode, if you care about that,‚Äù I suggested.¬† ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt even difficult.¬† Better question: Why haven‚Äôt you stopped Brkar?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe tried. ¬†*Physically,‚Äù* bleated his mother, Lorreka.¬† ‚ÄúHe just ‚Ä¶ peeled our paws off like we were pups!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs that strong?‚Äù I mused, pressing my ears against the glass as I watched the large pup practice kicks against air.¬† *‚ÄúCool.‚Äù*

‚ÄúRebra, this is categorically ***uncool!*****‚Äù** Lorreka rebuked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all entitled to our opinions,‚Äù I tail-shrugged.¬† ‚ÄúAnyway, if he‚Äôs supposed to be that strong, you must have installed a failsafe.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ We did, but we deactivated it not long after he was born,‚Äù Kaebal confessed.

I turned to them.¬† ‚ÄúReally?¬† Why?‚Äù

The couple exchanged helpless looks.

‚ÄúH-he‚Äôs our son ‚Ä¶‚Äù Lorreka slumped in defeat.

My eyes and ears drank their micro-twitches, pulses, breathing.¬† I sensed truth.

*\~They love him that much?\~* I concluded.

Lorreka perked up, staring at me like a cup of water on the scorched side of the planet.

‚ÄúRebra, can you help us?‚Äù she requested.

‚ÄúWhy so?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a *Clever Venlil!‚Äù* Lorreka stated.¬† ‚ÄúYou solve the puzzles no one else can.¬† If anyone can find the words to talk him down, it‚Äôs *you!‚Äù*

‚ÄúI asked *‚Äòwhy so?‚Äô* not *‚Äòhow so?‚Äô‚Äù* I clarified.¬† ‚ÄúBrkar‚Äôs chosen to fight a Shepherd.¬† Who am I to disrespect his decision?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs a pup!¬† He‚Äôs not ready ‚Ä¶‚Äù Lorreka mewled.

*‚ÄúReally?‚Äù* I pressed, raising myself off the ground on my long, strong tail to meet her at eye-level.¬† ‚ÄúA couple minutes ago, you implied that ‚ÄòA Strong Venlil‚Äô can defy the odds, and that *anyone* can be Strong.¬† That soil is freshly turned in his mind.¬† In all likelihood, he‚Äôs out there trying to prove a point, because *you* pep-talked him into this!‚Äù

Lorreka backed away and I lowered myself to the ground (my tail was getting tired).

‚ÄúOh stars ‚Ä¶ oh stars, you‚Äôre right!‚Äù she rambled, pacing and rubbing her arms.¬† ‚ÄúThe Shepherd‚Äôs going to kill him because I couldn‚Äôt keep my snout shut!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not going to kill him,‚Äù I sighed.¬† ‚ÄúThink about it pragmatically.¬† A Shepherd‚Äôs not just a sheepdog.¬† He‚Äôs their alpha.¬† Acquiring a position like that requires more self-control than the average sheepdog.¬† We have far too few assets against The Federation, and Brkar‚Äôs development was not cheap.¬† Shepherd‚Äôs aware that we can‚Äôt afford to lose Brkar before he becomes useful, so he won‚Äôt kill him.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue, though he will try to make a point,‚Äù Kaebal supposed. ¬†‚ÄúHe might even try to induce F.R.I.G.H.T. in Brkar.‚Äù

^(RebrA.I.: Fun fact: Humans may be creative, but they are not the ones who came up with the term, F.R.I.G.H.T. The High Herd simply allowed them to think that they did, as a subtle form of declassification.)

‚ÄúHe‚Äôd do that to a ***pup?‚Äù*** Lorreka almost snarled.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôd do that to a *weapon,‚Äù* I corrected.

9 minutes, eighteen seconds left.¬† I didn‚Äôt have to look.¬† I‚Äôd memorized the countdown in real time.¬† A tail twitch betrayed my cool demeanor.

*\~Oh, whatever.¬† Guess I‚Äôm doing this,\~* I inwardly sighed.

I tiptoed at the console and worked the microphone.

‚ÄúHi Brkar.¬† It‚Äôs Rebra.‚Äù

He paused his exercises.¬† ‚ÄúOh, hey, Rebra.¬† Here to talk me out of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps I can offer a helpful perspective,‚Äù I suggested.

He huffed and angled his ears at the speaker.¬† ‚ÄúOkay.¬† Shoot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is your opponent?¬† Do you know anything about him?‚Äù I asked.

I well knew who Brkar had challenged, but I don‚Äôt think he knew.¬† I wanted him to think about it.

‚ÄúRyvel implied he‚Äôs gonna kill me,‚Äù Brkar tail-shrugged.

Good.¬† He‚Äôd read the room.

‚ÄúWhat do *you* think?‚Äù I pressed.

‚ÄúI find it highly unlikely that such an established member of The High Herd would kill an asset,‚Äù Brkar concluded.

I flicked an ear heartily.¬† It was always wonderful to talk to a competent peer.

‚ÄúSo you know who he is?‚Äù I inquired.

‚ÄúNope.¬† Not really,‚Äù admitted Brkar.

‚ÄúAt present, his name is Jyromn.¬† He‚Äôs Shepherd of the sheepdogs, and quite possibly The High Herd,‚Äù I informed.

Brkar tilted his head.¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a sheepdog?‚Äù

They really didn‚Äôt tell him?

‚ÄúEver heard of Beekeeper?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he shrugged.

‚ÄúHow about Hitman?¬† Nikita?¬† [Blind Mice?‚Äù](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Geaeea) I persisted.

‚ÄúStarting to ring a bell,‚Äù he nodded.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt wanna fight you.¬† He wants to break you, and put the pieces back together into his idea of a better weapon,‚Äù I explained.¬† ‚ÄúYou might not be *you* when he‚Äôs done with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr maybe I‚Äôll just come back stronger,‚Äù he suggested.

‚ÄúMaybe you will,‚Äù I supposed.¬† ‚ÄúBut I will caution you: the Stables are right there, which means you‚Äôll have immediate medical attention when this is over.¬† He‚Äôll know that, so he won‚Äôt be afraid to tear you apart.¬† Have you considered how this may affect your family and friends?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre scared to watch, they can look away,‚Äù Brkar suggested.¬† ‚ÄúAnd what *‚Äòfriends‚Äô?‚Äù*

‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs me, for instance,‚Äù I noted

He whistled a chuckle.¬† ‚ÄúAll I did was give you a hug.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ I really needed that hug,‚Äù I admitted.¬† ‚ÄúBrkar, I don‚Äôt think you understand. Our lives are as engineered as the blood in our veins.¬† Our meeting today was The High Herd‚Äôs attempt to see if we could play nice, so we could work together in the future.¬† I was determined to actively dislike you, to make things more difficult than they had to be.¬† I failed.¬† I know that because Venlil body language is an open book, and I‚Äôm an avid reader.¬† You‚Äôre clever, but simple and blunt.¬† You‚Äôre not trying to trick me into liking you.¬† You just saw that I needed a hug, and you gave it to me.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ So?‚Äù he queried.

‚ÄúSo, forget Strong Venlil and Clever Venlil!‚Äù I blurted.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a ***Good*** Venlil, and I don‚Äôt want some sheepdog to tear that out of you along with your guts!‚Äù

Brkar‚Äôs tail thumped the ground as he thought.¬† ‚ÄúBy any chance have you seen my specs?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† You‚Äôre strong, but you‚Äôre still a pup,‚Äù I noted.

‚ÄúSo you really think a sheepdog could mess me up?‚Äù

I flicked an ear.¬† ‚ÄúWhatever you imagine they are, they‚Äôre probably worse.‚Äù

*‚ÄúGooooood\~!‚Äù* purred Brkar.

That‚Äôs when my brain stopped braining and frustration took the reins.

**--------------**

**Transcription transposition: Brkar, A Strong Venlil**

**--------------**

**BOCK!**

My ears shot up.¬† What was that sound?

‚ÄúRebra, did you just headbutt the console?‚Äù I chuckled.

A concerning pause.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ mmAy‚Ä¶be?‚Äù she slurred. ¬†‚ÄúBig ‚Ä¶ brain ‚Ä¶ constant concussion ‚Ä¶ risk.‚Äù

Ah.¬† That made sense.¬† She wasn‚Äôt built for headbutts, but that didn‚Äôt stop her from taking out her frustrations.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do that again,‚Äù I sighed.

**--------------**

**Transcription transposition: Rebra, A Clever Venlil**

**--------------**

I masssaged mmy fOrehead, squinting at the big pup on The Field.¬† WhEn I slammed my head into the console, he‚Äôd frozen for a fraction of a scratch, ears high, angled to the speaker.¬† Tail, stiff.¬† It was subtle, but he‚Äôd been on alert, trying to figure out what that sound was, and what it meant.¬† Was ‚Ä¶ he that concerned for me?¬† Maybe I could use this.

‚ÄúKaebal, could you please headbutt the console?‚Äù I requested.

Brkar‚Äôs father raised an ear at me, but complied all the same.¬† I studied Brkar as Kaebal headbutted the console.

***BOCK!***

Brkar did that thing again.¬† Frozen.¬† High alert.¬† Nuances of body language reminiscent of a big brother who feared for his sister.¬† I knew it.¬† His role model was Superman, which implied a strong, personal investment in keeping everyone ‚Äòsafe‚Äô.¬† In spite of his inability to feel pain, he pseudo-empathized with me.¬† Interesting.

His concern turned to amusement nuanced with anger.¬† ‚ÄúHey, Dad!¬† Taking marching orders from a pup?¬† I never thought you were the type.‚Äù

Okay ‚Ä¶ he recognized the sound of his father‚Äôs headbutt?¬† How often did this happen?¬† Never mind that.¬† So, it had to be me.¬† If I held myself hostage and kept headbutting the console, it was highly probable that he‚Äôd back out ‚Ä¶ and resent me ‚Ä¶ forever.

I rubbed my ears.¬† *\~What to do?¬† What to do?\~*

‚ÄúRebra, what do you love?‚Äù he asked out of the blue.

I cocked my head.¬† What a strange question.

‚ÄúI am uncertain as to whether or not I love anything,‚Äù I confessed.¬† ‚ÄúHowever, I do enjoy talking to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me rephrase that: what do you need?‚Äù he asked.

I blinked.¬† ‚ÄúUm, air, water, food, shelter-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Clever Venlil,‚Äù he asserted.¬† *‚ÄúWhat. ¬†Do. ¬†You.* ¬†***Need?‚Äù***

It clicked.¬† ‚ÄúInformation.¬† Mental stimulation.¬† I need to use my brain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what would happen if you were placed in solitary confinement for a set of paws?¬† Nothing to see?¬† Nothing to think about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd ‚Ä¶ starve,‚Äù I shuddered.

***‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù*** he asserted with a tail-thump of finality.

I was starting to understand.

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, I‚Äôve been reading about dogs,‚Äù he shared.¬† ‚ÄúDifferent breeds were created for different purposes.¬† Some are highly intelligent, designed for complex, rigorous tasks, then people just get them because they‚Äôre cute, or pretty, or big, or whatever.¬† They treat these dogs like trophies, force them to live boring, sedentary lives where they don‚Äôt get to do what they were *made* to do.¬† Rebra, I‚Äôm a Strong Venlil.¬† I wasn‚Äôt designed to get trotted out at fancy parties like some kind of show piece.¬† You‚Äôve been force-fed information, but I haven‚Äôt had a good meal in my life.¬† I‚Äôm ***starving.***¬† I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs some killer sheepdog.¬† I ***WILL*** **have my meal.‚Äù**

‚ÄúI sympathize,‚Äù came a voice from behind me.

I almost jumped out of my wool.

Th-The Shepherd was behind me.¬† That steady, grandfatherly warmth emanated from him, yet a void-cold chill crawled deep under my wool.¬† Outwardly, I was calm, collected.¬† Inside, my thoughts stampeded.

*\~How did he get so close??¬† Thatwasn‚Äôtsupposedtobepossible!* ***Whydidn‚ÄôtIsensehim??*** ***StupidstupidSTUPID!***¬† *Oh, wait ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd sensed him.¬† Walking back through my memories, I see him enter the room, but I don‚Äôt* ***truly*** *see him.¬† The way he moves, prowling at the edge of my perception.¬† He‚Äôs trained to do this, but ‚Ä¶ oh stars, he‚Äôs looking at me.¬† Reading me.¬† I‚Äôm reading him reading me.¬† I‚Äôm reading him reading me reading hi-feÃ∂ÕÇÃìÃ≥ÕôedÃ∏ÕÅÃ≠bÃ∑ÃÉaÃ∑cÃ∏ÃÜk Ã∑ÃÇÃ™Ã°loÃ¥oÃ∏Õêp.Ã∑*¬† ***Snap out of it!***¬† *He‚Äôs not gonna kill me.¬† I need to-\~*

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see me,‚Äù he noted.

My ears went flat.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Clever Venlil.¬† I see everything.‚Äù

He leant forward, amusement in his ears.¬† ‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt see *me.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶‚Äù I had no retort.

I‚Äôd barely caught his paw move.¬† It wasn‚Äôt fast.¬† It was just ‚Ä¶ *there,* on my head.¬† Petting me.¬† Sensing my inner conflict, he‚Äôd decided that I needed a little comfort.¬† It wasn‚Äôt working.¬† I knew what he was.¬† My instincts knew what he was.¬† The scent-taste of blood was baked into his wool.

I felt to throw up.

Blinking at my thinly veiled discomfort, he ear-smirked and whistled a chuckle.¬† One more pat and his paw was gone.

**‚ÄúHey, old goat!‚Äù** Brkar brayed from The Field.¬† **‚ÄúWhat are you doing up there?¬† I‚Äôm starving!¬† Bring down the mutton!‚Äù**

‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù The Shepherd assuaged.¬† ‚ÄúRebra is right.¬† You are too valuable to die, and you‚Äôre not ready to face a sheepdog.¬† That‚Äôs why I prepared a meal that may better suit your tastes.‚Äù

[The countdown ended.](https://youtu.be/HV8n58hx_tY?si=cZ4W6h9Y1Or4QyKR&t=161)

# ( ( ‚ÄúCOMMENCING FIELD TEST,‚Äù ) )

a digitized voice announced over the speaker.

One of the pen doors began to rise, slowly unveiling the opponent.¬† If The Shepherd wasn‚Äôt down there, then who-?

My ears shot up.

Oh ‚Ä¶ oh no.

I knew, the moment I saw gray.

**--------------**

**Transcription transposition: Brkar, A Strong Venlil**

**--------------**

My breath hitched.¬† Those claws.¬† Those scales.¬† That muzzle, sniffing and snapping under the door as it gradually lifted.

I knew what this was.

My wool puffed.¬† My whole body was shaking.¬† Tears brimmed my eyes.¬† Was I actually crying?¬† I never imagined what this would feel like.¬† The rush of emotion hit so hard that my tail forgot to wag.

My meal ‚Ä¶ after all these years, I had *my meal!*

I wept and brayed, loud and shameless.

The door was barely a fourth the way up when he writhed and wriggled under it.

An Arxur.

**RebrA.I.:** Even then, Brkar was strong.  Maybe the strongest Venlil in the universe, but he was still a pup, and there's a difference between strength and Strength.  What will happen to Brkar?

We have a Delonghi Gran Dama ESAM6600 and parang hindi consistent ang na pro-produce niyang coffee. This is an old machine na and we‚Äôve been using it for so long already. 

We don‚Äôt know much about coffee machines and honestly, tamad kami gumawa ng coffee kaya pindot2x nalang. Hehe. But we just need a cappuccino daily, hindi naman kami maarte sa coffee. Looking for recos lang, yung old Delonghi namin yung coffee na lumalabas is watery. Is there a fully automatic machine na makakagawa ng decent espresso? Prefer din namin below ‚Ç±100k sana yung price. 

Thank you! ",6,1749010818.0,CoffeePH,10,0.88,False

1l2wftr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l2wftr/icebreaker_part_2/,Icebreaker part 2,"The war room at H.A.L.O. headquarters smelled faintly of ozone and old coffee‚Äîa smell that Cole Striker learned to love.

He leaned against the cool glass wall, arms crossed, watching satellite footage flicker across the main screen. A slow-moving Arctic storm blurred the image, but the anomaly was clear: a perfect circle, nearly a kilometer wide, burned into the ice shelf like a fingerprint pressed into snow.

No blast signature. No tectonic ripple. Just... a hole where nothing should be.

Director Marcus Keene stepped into the room, the weight of too many secrets riding his shoulders.

""You‚Äôve been to hellholes, Striker,‚Äù Keene said. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs cold, quiet, and deep. You‚Äôll like it.‚Äù

Cole didn‚Äôt smile. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you said about Kamchatka.‚Äù

Keene dropped a file on the table. It fanned open to reveal thermal maps, Soviet diagrams, and a glossy photo of a woman standing in front of a glacial fissure. Fair skin. Red hair. Expression unreadable behind mirrored goggles.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the redhead?‚Äù Cole asked.

‚ÄúDr. Evelyn Shaw,‚Äù Keene said. ‚ÄúBritish glaciologist. Contracted under the UN arctic anomaly initiative. Her outpost is twenty clicks from the impact site. She‚Äôs already flagged seismic anomalies we can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

¬†Keene eyed him as Cole studied the photo.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been tracking this pattern for years. Doesn‚Äôt even know it. She thinks it‚Äôs natural. It‚Äôs not.‚Äù

The door opened and Wrench sauntered in, carrying a tablet in one hand and a donut in the other.

‚ÄúTell me we‚Äôre not going to Canada again,‚Äù he said through a mouthful. ‚ÄúI still have frostbite in places I don‚Äôt talk about.‚Äù

Keene ignored him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dropping you in from a Norwegian icebreaker. Classified approach. No satellite uplinks. Full blackout. You‚Äôll rendezvous with Shaw, assess the site, and retrieve anything out of place.‚Äù

Cole tapped the satellite image. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt look natural.‚Äù

Keene nodded. ‚ÄúBecause it isn‚Äôt. We think it‚Äôs part of a global pattern. Russia had something similar on file. They called it *Mekhanizm Vodnyy*‚Äîthe Water Mechanism. Their teams never came back.‚Äù

Wrench‚Äôs face lost its usual smugness. ‚ÄúWell. That‚Äôs comforting.‚Äù

Cole closed the file. ‚ÄúWhen do we leave?‚Äù

Keene‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWheels up in six hours. And Striker‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked up.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just another dive. If that machine under the ice is waking up, we‚Äôre already late.‚Äù









Cole didn‚Äôt believe in packing light. Not when trouble had a habit of running him down.

The iron gate groaned shut behind his car with a hydraulic hiss. His cobalt-blue 1965 AC Cobra rolled across the polished brick of the old freight loading platform and into the converted depot‚Äôs garage. He put his hand on the ignition switch, but decided to let the rumble of the 289 V8 echo for a second longer‚Äîjust enough to feel it in his chest.

The building had once shuttled goods from sea to rail, its bones laid in 1894. Now, it housed Cole Striker and his eclectic collection of guitars and guns between missions.

He stepped inside the loft and took a breath. The space was a contradiction of glass and iron, vintage filament bulbs dangling from repurposed rail beams. An old semaphore tower rose from the corner like a sculptural relic, its signal arms frozen mid-message. Floor-to-ceiling windows gave him a panoramic view of the city skyline, twinkling in the dusk like a distant galaxy on the move.

Home.

The hum of modernity faded as he moved through the space. A gear locker sat recessed behind sliding industrial doors near the kitchen. He keyed in a short code and the locks disengaged with a *chunk.*

Inside, everything was where it should be. Field-tuned Walther P99 nestled in a low-profile Kydex holster. A matte-black Armalite M15 chambered in 5.56, custom optics mounted. Two suppressors. Tactical harness. Arctic thermal layers sealed in vacuum packs. Knives‚Äîthree of them‚Äîeach a different shape, purpose, and attitude.

He began laying them out on the island, checking each one with a slow, deliberate rhythm.

‚ÄúYou know, if you just said the word, I‚Äôd stay home this time,‚Äù he said to the shadows.

Cole sighed, ‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt resist the feel of your body against mine.‚Äù

Silence.

Cole reached over and flicked on a spotlight above a raised guitar stand at the edge of the room.

Bright cherry red. Black pickguard. Mahogany neck worn smooth from decades of heat and heartbreak.

A 1980 Gibson SG.

He picked her up like she might break, thumb caressing the neck as if reading braille. The body shimmered like fresh blood in the low light.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre angry tonight,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI can feel it in your curves.‚Äù

He plugged her into the small fender tube amp by the window, spun a single volume knob, and struck a low E. It growled like a beast waking up.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs called Lucy,‚Äù he‚Äôd told a girl once. ‚ÄúShort for Lucifer. Because she screams like the devil.‚Äù

She hadn‚Äôt laughed.

But Lucy had.

He ran a slow, bluesy lick along the frets, the sound bending into a melancholic moan. Outside, the city blinked back at him.

He played only for a minute. Any more, and he'd start to feel something.

He set her gently on the stand and turned back to the gear. Ghost Two was prepped. HALO was prepped. Wrench would be halfway through a burrito and completely through a conspiracy theory by now.

Cole pulled the Walther from its case, locked the slide, and tucked it into his duffel. The rifle followed, its weight a familiar counterbalance to the unknown.

He zipped the bag closed and gave Lucy one last look.

""Save me a song,"" he murmured.

Then he killed the lights and stepped back into the night.









The HALO airfield was buried in the Maryland woods, a forgotten stretch of concrete that never showed up on satellite maps. The surrounding tree line swallowed light like a black hole, leaving only the hum of a C-130's idling turbines to cut through the cold air.

Cole rolled up slow, headlights off, Cobra growling low. The air smelled like aviation fuel, old pine, and a hint of trouble.

A rust-patched Toyota pickup was already there, its rear bumper held up by faith, duct tape, and a misplaced sense of optimism. A rickety toolbox and two homemade cigar box guitars were wedged in the bed, one painted stars-and-stripes, the other scorched black like it had seen actual combat.

Striker killed the engine, grabbed his duffel, and walked over just as Wrench popped the hood on the truck and muttered something about ‚Äúdamn idle again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, someday that thing‚Äôs going to die and I‚Äôm going to dance at the funeral,‚Äù Cole said.

Wrench looked up, grinning beneath a scraggly beard that refused to conform to any grooming standard.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll outlive both of us,‚Äù he said, slapping the hood with a mechanic‚Äôs affection. ‚ÄúUnlike most cars, mine‚Äôs immune to computer viruses and EMPs. And if she breaks down, I can fix her with a wrench and duct tape. Hence the nickname.‚Äù

Wrench‚Äîreal name Samuel Kerrigan‚Äîhad once been the best combat engineer in the 75th Ranger Regiment. That was before a rogue IED in Kandahar ripped through his convoy and left him dragging two men to safety with one arm nearly useless and a leg full of shrapnel. The Army gave him a medal and a discharge. H.A.L.O. gave him a second chance.

Striker had met him two years later in Jakarta, mid-op. Wrench was neck-deep in an improvised bomb, trying to disarm it with nothing but pliers and a whiskey hangover. Striker covered him from rooftop snipers, took a round in the vest doing it.

Three months later, Wrench pulled Cole out of a collapsed bunker in the Iranian desert with a broken femur and six minutes of oxygen left. Neither man ever brought those stories up. They didn‚Äôt need to.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lucy?‚Äù Wrench asked as they walked toward the plane.

‚ÄúHome. She doesn‚Äôt like the cold.‚Äù

Wrench shook his head. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs high-maintenance, that one. Bet she‚Äôs still in her red dress, curled up by the window.‚Äù

Cole said nothing but a slight grin crept onto his lips.

Wrench gave him a sidelong look. ‚ÄúOne of these days I want to meet the woman who makes you sing the blues.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already have,‚Äù Cole muttered, a half-smile now formed.

They climbed the ramp into the belly of the plane. Inside: crates labeled H.A.L.O. and filled with anything they might need, field kits, oxygen tanks, and the low drone of classified urgency.

Wrench dropped into his seat and cracked his neck. ‚ÄúI read the dossier. Glowing circle in the ice, missing seismic drones, and a ginger glaciologist who looks like trouble.‚Äù

Striker raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou profiling again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just have a type. And it‚Äôs usually red flags and red hair.‚Äù

Cole smirked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not your type.‚Äù

Wrench leaned back and closed his eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù

The ramp began to close behind them, sealing them into the kind of darkness only H.A.L.O. ops could summon. The engines roared to life.

Striker leaned his head back and listened to the rhythm of the engines, feeling the vibration settle into his bones.

The world below was falling asleep without a hint of the chaos that was awakening and Striker had answers waiting under the ice.

Next stop: the Arctic.
