Is developing acid reflux common after a thyroidectomy? Ever since the second surgery to remove the rest of my thyroid my acid reflux and burpiness is bad. I take prilosec OTC at night or when it acts up and it helps a bit, but has anyone found any other things that help? My ENT gave me 'the list' of foods to avoid and I'm trying but they are going to have to pry coffee and tomato sauce from my cold dead hands. 

I had acid reflux a bit as a kid, but it kind of went away in adulthood. Now its back and I hate it. ENT did an endoscope and found that it was even making my 'pharynx' a bit red and swollen which she said was likely causing my 'clicking' feeling when swallowing and the sort of phlegmy drainage I feel in the morning.

They hang out in places like Port Baku, wearing fake designer clothes, sipping overpriced coffee, and talking like they own half the city. I’ve seen some of them literally look down on waiters and regular people, like they’re royalty.

One of the most entitled things I’ve seen was a kid bragging about how his dad “pays for the police anyway” so rules don’t apply to him. Another one tried to flex by saying “we never fly economy,” only for his Instagram stories to accidentally show he was very much in economy.

It’s honestly wild how much entitlement comes not from actual success, but from pretending or riding on shady family money.

1ndxlfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1ndxlfd/the_untold_story/,The Untold Story,"```
Behind the villainous reality that separates us  
We crossed the raging oceans together,  
Climbed hundreds of towering mountains,  
Traveled thousands of miles,  
Until we reached the quiet forest.  

There, you became the sun in my sky,  
My remedy for every misery,  
And the last puzzling piece of my jigsaw.  

I love you the way I long to relive every beautiful dream I’ve had.  
You remind me of my favorite morning coffee,  
The scent of delicate flowers in the garden,  
And the dazzling moonlight above.  
What a seamless canvas you've become to my sight!  
You're such a breathtaking masterpiece,  
One who painted passion into my soul.  

Our hearts, flowing to the same cue,  
Created a sea of sensations.  
Every aching moment caused by flying bullets  
Was healed by wildflower bandages.  
Every gap between our heartbeats was filled with love.  
That's how it became a vicious cycle —  
A cycle we became addicted to,  
A cycle we can no longer escape, even through a loophole.  

I created poetry for you then,  
Writing with my pen dipped in the blood flowing through my veins.  
I was moved by your story.  
And it was the kind of movement that didn’t push me away —  
It pulled me closer.  
Close enough to hear music in your heartbeat,  
And close enough to create space for unspoken thoughts.  

Indeed, a love without frontiers, yet separated by distance —  
Not between us, but between the reality and truth that contradict us.  
Cheek by jowl, we hold on to what keeps us  
Alive in the midst of what kills us.  
But where will it lead us?  

We're like birds, but we can't fly —  
Because it sinned us.  

Does it ever feel better?  
Mistake after mistake,  
Just to fulfill a destiny?  
I wanted the ending to be beautiful,  
But I don’t want to see the end.  
How paradoxical it is — to hope for something good when it's over,  
Yet not want it to be over.  

Sure, I'm in love with you.  
And it’s the kind of love that’s been tattooed into my body,  
A kind of love carved into my bones.  

You are my untold story —  
A priceless treasure I hid in a jar,  
A perfect dress I locked in the closet,  
And the tears I covered with a smile.  
You are my untold story.  
The forever great love of my life.  
Our love may not be visible,  
But it's written in the stars.  
```

I wanted to share a little secret with you all that's just begging to be discovered this fall: **Havre de Grace, Maryland**. Seriously, if you haven't been, you are missing out on one of the most charming, picture-perfect towns in the state... and only between 1.25 min and 1.5 hours north of Bethesda.

Picture this: The air is getting crisp, the leaves are starting to change, and you're strolling along the waterfront with a cup of coffee. That's Havre de Grace in the fall, and it's pure magic. It's got that cozy, small-town vibe you dream of, but with tons of cool stuff to do.

What makes it so great?

* **The Views:** We're right where the Susquehanna River meets the Chesapeake Bay, so the scenery is absolutely stunning. It’s the kind of place you'll want to take a million photos.
* **Main Street:** It’s straight out of a movie. Quaint shops, art galleries, and some seriously good food. You can easily spend an entire afternoon just exploring.
* **The Lighthouse:** You can't come here and not see the historic Concord Point Lighthouse. It’s a landmark for a reason!
* **Fall Feels:** The whole town gets into the autumn spirit. Think farmers' markets, fall festivals, and a relaxed atmosphere perfect for unwinding.

Now, to make planning your trip super easy, I want to introduce you to a new local platform for all things Havre de Grace:[ **The HdG Beacon**](https://www.hdgbeacon.com). It’s basically your go-to guide for everything in town. No more sifting through a dozen different websites or Facebook pages.

Me and my partner recently bought a Delonghi Magnifica S auto coffee machine, but it continues to make watery coffee. 

It’s really bad, and I have tried to fix it with no luck. 
I tried adjusting grind size, but I’ve found no difference no matter the size adjustment. Also yes, I only adjusted it one bit at a time, while the machine is running, resulting in a huge waste of my coffee beans :(
I have the coffee amount to max, I don’t really understand how to adjust the water levels but supposedly I tried. 
I just timed how long a normal shot took to come out, and readjusted it to be a little less longer, hoping it decreased the water levels. 
Please help, I really don’t know what else to do to fix it. I’m not too much of a coffee nerd, more of a beginner, I know the basics but when it comes to measurements and ratios and all of that I’m dumbfounded.

Also if I’m in the wrong area please let me know where else to ask for advice

But the scary part starts now — I haven’t received my salary. May, June, July, and August have all passed, but still no payment. I followed up multiple times, but nothing has been received.

In April, I noticed his lifestyle looked very comfortable — spending ₹250 on coffee, living in a house with ₹60,000 rent, and so on. He convinced me to invest ₹6 lakh in his other startup related to manufacturing. Believing him, I even borrowed money from my mother and gave it to him.

Later, in September, I found out that he had also taken ₹5 lakh from different people under different pretexts. One of my mutual friends gave him money, and some others didn’t.

Now, I have requested him to refund my money. He has sent me an email saying that he will refund the amount within 60 working days. But I don’t trust him at all.

What legal help can I seek if I don’t receive the money?
And what does “60 working days” even mean? Does the process really continue in working days only and it continuously happens in working days??

He was one of the sweetest people by talking, but now all my trust is gone.

For example, let’s say 12:03 or 12:04 is a starting point. Assuming the clock is fully functional, would the 1:33 later in the series indicate that he intentionally set that time or that they were talking for about an hour and a half? Same with 4:19 to 5:26 to 6:06 etc.

I haven’t looked into this myself, but if you look to the coffee cups, lock, and Tucker, you could theoretically narrow down times to ones that he intentionally set prior to the interview.

I prepared myself a coffee, ate some fruit, and went outside. I got on my motorcycle—it was a super sport bike—and I rode to a hangar located behind the city center. The hangar was completely empty, but I was aware that it belonged to me. Inside, there was only one elevator on the wall. When I arrived, there was a biometric sensor. I scanned it, entered a pin, and then the elevator opened. I got in and went down quite a few floors, but there were only 2 levels: the one I got on and the one I would get off.

When I got off, I saw a room—this room was as big as the hangar, even bigger. Every side of it was covered with plates twice the size of a human, and the room was rectangular. In the middle, there were two semicircles made of hexagons, cut right down the middle by a platform. Under this platform, inside another hexagonal circle, there was a sphere, completely metallic. On the platform itself, four metallic extensions came in from the sides toward the center. Besides that, on the left and right sides of the machine there were servers—supercomputers. At the front, the side I entered from, there was a desk with a normal computer setup of three monitors. A person was sitting there. To the left, four people were monitoring the four servers placed side by side. On the right side, there was a gap between two servers and then two more. Facing those right-side servers, further back in the room, there were three people. On my side, two people. And in the middle, three people preparing the pilot who would use the machine. On top of the machine itself, one person was standing.

Then I walked to the person standing next to the computer and said something. After that, I went to the pilot and spoke with him a little, checked his helmet and suit. Then I went over to the people monitoring the servers on the left. Finally, the person standing on top of the machine began walking toward me when I arrived in front of it. There were glass stairs leading up to the machine. This person was a tall, blonde woman in formal clothing, holding a checklist. Like me, she was doing inspections. She told me, “Our investor will definitely be satisfied with this.” But deep inside, I knew I didn’t like her much. Then, as she joined us, everyone else stepped back. We stood behind the computer, and the pilot stepped onto the machine’s platform.

I told the computer operator to start. Immediately, the metallic sphere beneath the hexagonal barrier began to spin, endlessly. Then the arms started moving, and the upper hexagonal dome began to close. The metallic sphere, along with its hexagonal barrier, rose through the solid platform and came to the point where the four extensions met. At the same time, gravity disappeared in the room, and we all started floating in midair. I was positioned directly in front of the sphere, aligned with it. The only one unaffected by the loss of gravity was the pilot—he still had it.

Then, from the hexagonal-shielded sphere, a bright blue light shone. The moment I saw that light, I felt as if I had lived thousands of different lives. Right after that, everyone suddenly dropped to the floor, and I saw that the pilot had vanished.

I had this dream. Now here’s the interesting part: I experienced this dream in such a vivid, indistinguishable way that I was absolutely convinced it was real. I was around 25 years old in the dream, but when I had it, I was only in the 3rd year of middle school (out of a 4-year system). What’s strange is this: none of the people I saw in that dream, at that time, were people I knew in real life. In fact, I saw them as their older selves. But as I grew up, I ended up meeting them—some in high school, some in university, some through friends of friends. And now, at 22, I’ve met everyone from that dream except for the blonde woman on the platform.

My question to you is: how could I have seen in a dream, back in middle school, the 25-year-old versions of people I didn’t know yet, only to later meet them in real life? Does this possibility make the reality of the dream stronger?",3,1757557575.0,DreamInterpretation,2,1.0,False

For quick backstory/stats, I am a 50 HLM married to a 48 LLF. Since we had sex to conceive our son 11 years ago, we’ve had 6 sexual encounters. Our DB has a lot of reasons - inability to communicate about sex, her mental health and trauma issues, COVID, parenting, etc. BUT, of the 6 sexual encounters in the past 11 years, 2 have been in the past few weeks - Yay!

One (maybe) important data point is that I haven’t initiated at all over the past 11 years, though I have expressed my desire for her a few times and in the past couple of year, I have asked multiple times to talk about our sex life, but it has never really happened.

A few weeks ago, I decided to try initiating…I ended up giving her a massage that night which ended up with my hands down her pants, getting her off. This last weekend, I again asked if we could do something physical. She wasn’t feeling up for it that night, but said we would do something the following night - which we did! She was really into it and we had a good time including ending the night with intercourse.

I let her know the following day that it was a really special and connecting night, but I want to bring it up again with her soon. I really feel like we’ve turned a corner here, and I am wondering how much of it was just me needing to start initiating again. But this is where I’d love the perspective of any LL women who have recovered a DB:

1) This last time, she got close to orgasm but didn’t make it there. I am not sure if/how to bring it up. I don’t want to put an pressure on her to feel like I want/need her to orgasm. At the same time, I want to make sure if we are going to revive our sex life that it is good/satisfying for her. Any advice here on how to talk about whether these two recent encounters were satisfying for her

2) I feel like in part we are where we are because I was finally able to express my own needs/wants in a clear way, and she has been very receptive to that. Along the same line, I want to find a way to talk more about where we are and where we can go from here…BUT I don’t want to push too hard to seem too overbearing. For any women who have been in this early part of recovering a DB, how would you want your partner to have reacted/talked to you about where to go from here?

3) We have a regular Friday coffee date. I want to take a few minutes this week to just let her know how much I love that we have found our way to a place where I can initiate, she can turn me down/push it off, but we do find a way to connect. This seems so silly, but it really is as meaningful to me as the actual sex itself. Is this something worth expressing? 

I don’t know if anyone has perspective on the dynamic we are in now, but would love any advice anyone could offer here!",1,1757557547.0,DeadBedrooms,2,1.0,False

Nowhere else has a sustainable place for my thoughts in... my reality, at the moment. So for that reason, I hope this isn't taken down by moderators.

Kirk was an abhorrent piece of shit who would do and say most things to draw a reaction out of a crowd. He liked it- he used rhetoric to justify every facet of hate that he could come up with. I don't know whether or not he really believed his daughter should have to deliver a baby if it is forced upon her. But he did say that to argue a point.   
He said that every life a bullet took was worth it to hold a gun in America. I think he did not value the lives of people that opposed him or stood in his way. And if he did, I've seen no evidence of him indicated that he *did.* The image that he projected was a purely hateful one demonstrating the worst of the MAGA movement. Several lives have probably been worse off because of what he's said.

Did he deserve it? I don't know. If you believe that a life is only valued exactly by the actions you take- I don't think he made any good decisions on his behalf. At best, he was incredibly greedy and ready to betray every virtue possible to line his pockets. At worst, he was incredibly hateful and believed that his demented philosophies were driving this country down a good path. 

\-

All of this being said, if you celebrate his death, you are a ***huge*** part of the problem.

I'm not of the perspective that just because he was a loving father and husband for that reason alone you should be shocked and horrified at people celebrating his death. I am saying this because hate and anger is blind, ignorant, and stupid.

I saw someone today comment in this subreddit today something like: ""I would advocate for shooting them all, except for the fact that our side would lose some too."" And I cannot tell you how alien that sentiment is to me. The left vs. right argument has become so extremified it is now cartoonish. Reality is so cartoonish that nobody believes in it anymore. Our leading democracy is purely self-interested, and pedestrians are so busy on their phones they will no longer make eye contact with the person who makes their coffee. Let alone even attempting to help someone in need.   
I'm not attached to the internet. I know good people still exist and I know them well. But on a whole, something has happened. Media worked- society shifted- and there are simply more people without a soul than there ever has been.

The real problem with Luigi is that the vigilante that takes his place won't know their right arm from their left, and decide to shoot Conan O'Brien or Billie Eilish because they are capitalist-scum that has profited off a corruptive system that left the rest of us in the dust. That's what you saw here today.  
  
No matter what Charlie advocated for, realistically his listeners were already hooked into the rabbit hole and looking for even more reasons to be hateful. His death does nothing but aggravate a sore muscle. He's a *bad target* picked by a fucking moron. This does nothing to disable a movement. Only radicalize it. And again and again every year it happens on 'both sides' and every single year it gets worse. The world spins quicker until we're all paste on the pavement. I remember reading what people thought about the two Democratic senators being shot and the people celebrating their deaths look exactly the same as the people celebrating Kirk's death today.

All because some news sites wanted some clicks and some money. 

\-

There will be no revolution in America. There is no King Louis XVI to point at and blame for everything. People are too scattered, and the land is too massive. It will literally just be fighting and more fighting until... people will just be worse off.

Yes, Ethan and Hila are in (hypothetical) danger. All it takes is one in the millions of people who have been motivated by Hasan's cronies who have been bathing in an environment where getting rid of ""Zionists"" is a great thing. To be clear, Hasan is in danger too. I don't know, does HASAN deserve it? Where do you draw the shooting people line? Nobody listens, anymore. Nobody cares what each other has to say past the initial THING that made them angry. Whether misinformed or otherwise.

We are now in an environment where it's societally 'okay' to do this, and it's been proven to be effective more than once. And I think it's... inevitable. Because of our media, because of our government, because people are bored and want the pendulum to shift. You've seen it in history and you've seen it in psyche. There were what, 2 other school shootings today? The news doesn't care to cover it because they don't profit off of it. Hatred and ignorance is winning and I'm so sick of it. This isn't the norm, this wouldn't have been in the past.

I thought it was crazy growing up but I can honestly say the drug Haldol 2mg was the trick to recovery for me. It’s like the lowest dose but enough relaxation to control the ticks and stims without getting tired. Please consult with your doctor first as guys may not be the right treatment for everyone. It works right away and usually you can the it at night beside bed and it regulate the ticks and stims the next day.

Please reach back out to let us know if it ever helped a tone else. When I drink coffee I tick out very bad. It seems like in the morning my head is the clearest and by night time I’m a waking tick bomb! It’s also because of the caffeine I consume during the day.

I eat a very clean diet and keep the toxins out except for coffee. Ha, I do t drink alcohol anymore but that worked but wasn’t my right thing to do.

When I mediate it helps. What I found out was right when you feel the urge to tick, concentrate on something else for 10 seconds and it passes. Being nearly 47 years old I have learned a lot the tricks to contain it. At times I have to go in the bathroom and freak out! Ha, but that’s on bad days. I feel like when I’m outside in fresh air it helps and when is crazy when  I sit on my couch and watch tv. The nervous energy is too much so I try to think about the beach for 10 seconds. I Also  learned to scratch my arm or do something other than tick to help the urge go away.

The worst of my ticks happens when it gets stuffy and warm inside the home when I keep my AC on 61 compare to 67 degrees it mates a night and day difference.

Once again this is speaking  for myself only just if any one of you want to try the after alternatives take what you want from this message and leave the rest.

It’s also hard and disappointing they do t go night researching on this to find a cure!  They can find out how to clone things are have a robot act as a human but motion with Tourette’s. It’s probably an easy cure to soft part of the brain to adjusted with medical treatment, laser surgery. It may be just a drug that blocks  the singular in the brain to make us switch or tic. Just like they can get other medicine to block  the nerves from feeling pain.

I live a good life but it’s torture every day without my med. Most days I’m cloudy and not well. If zi to my therapy I’m good to go. I hope this helped anyone who reads it. Please excuse any misspells as well. I typed this very fast on my excerpted bike with one hand! lol

I never thought I’d post in here but my boyfriend (30M) of 4.5 years broke up with me (30F) suddenly after arriving home from a 2 week trip to Europe together. He said we were going to go camping on Friday night to be together without distractions and work on things, and instead he moved his belongings out of our home while I was at work. 

Bit of backstory, we met when we were both 25 in 2021. We had only known each other for about 2 weeks when we found out his Mom had brain cancer. It was a hard beginning to our relationship navigating an exciting time in our lives together while also dealing with a terminal illness of his parent. The first time I met his Mom was after brain surgery, when she came out of the hospital in sock feet and gave me a big hug. 
His mom was sick for the next 2 years before she sadly passed away. We went through so much within that time.

His father has had issues with any females in both his son’s lives and claims that the women are taking them away from him. He never did like me and was rude to anyone he crossed. I’m sure this wasn’t easy for my partner either because there’s nothing him and I wanted more than getting along with great in-laws. 

We had a beautiful relationship. We loved fast and especially in the beginning we both said “when you know, you know”. He told me he loved me after 1 month of being together and I felt that with my entire being. He was kind, compassionate, caring and all around the ideal person for me to start a life with. We remained inseparable throughout our relationship.

We travelled a lot and were constantly doing things every weekend. Continuing weekly date nights when he wasn’t away because he travelled a lot for work and hobbies so that was a hard pill for me to swallow in the beginning. I wanted to be selfish and be with him. 

I don’t have a lot of friends or major hobbies so that bothered him because he knew I would get bored and sometimes sad while he was away and it made him feel guilty. I got over it 2 years into our relationship and learned to enjoy my alone time again to do whatever I wanted. I had lived alone prior to being with him for 5 years. I’m also an only child to a single parent so I spent majority of my childhood in solitude. I never wanted him to feel guilty for leaving me for weeks at a time. I’m a big girl and can handle it. We never really fought or argued during our relationship so in my opinion I thought everything was okay.

Fast forward to last November of 2024, my Mom got extremely sick and ended up in the hospital. She almost died from a staph infection that was caused by an abscess on her spinal cord. She lost all mobility during that time. While being in the hospital for over 3 months, she was also diagnosed with endometrial cancer. My boyfriend stood by me though all of it and we decided it was best to move into her house with her to help out.

February 2025 we moved into my Moms house. We had an agreement that she would “gift” us the house to get a head start in our lives and a place to grow together. We needed to renovate the house before we moved into it so my boyfriend worked hard on the house during my mom’s time in the hospital. The only catch was that the payment of the renovations were tied to a Home Equity Line of Credit that was under my mom’s name and we had to pay off the loan. We picked out appliances, paint, flooring and fixtures and we were both so excited for this new chapter. We were living in basement suites for the last almost 10 years so having a larger place was nice. 

It was only this year that I started actively talking about engagement rings and saying that we’re coming up to our 5 year anniversary and it would be nice to be engaged. Family and friends started asking him and bugging him about it too and I admit it went too far at times. There were words exchanged that I regret saying. Mostly along the lines of how I shouldn’t have to beg for a ring. 

We had a trip planned to Europe (we’re from BC Canada) in August 2025 for two weeks. It was a vacation for us and I would later fly home solo while he was competing in an Olympic level rifle match in the UK for an additional week.
Our trip was great in my opinion, there were zero fights but it was constant go-go-go and extremely hot. This took a toll on my energy and my feet were so swollen. During our trip we weren’t intimate at all. It was on my side of things where I was so exhausted and my body just ached from all the walking and travelling we were doing. Our sex life has slown down a lot because of me. I have gained weight and am no longer comfortable with myself. I also deal with some other mental heath issues that contribute to the matter. He was always understanding about it but I feel so guilty. It was never about not being attracted to one another anymore.

He arrived home a week after me and was only home for 2 days before leaving again for another 4 days. We didn’t get to even discuss our trip and reflect on anything.

He went away to a rifle match and when he came back something had switched. Monday Sept 1, we went for breakfast like normal and went to the shops for groceries. We decided to make cocktails in the backyard and enjoy the last weekend of summer weather. We no sooner sit in the patio and he says “I’ve been thinking that we should breakup”. My hear shattered instantly and I asked if we could go inside to discuss.

He didn’t really have solid reasons, everything he told me were fixable issues such as more alone time, space, finding common hobbies, working on solo hobbies, more intimate time. He left for a couple hours for a drive and returned back that night.
I asked if we could get together the next night to chat and he agreed. We went for a drive and had dinner. The conversation continued for the worst and he still wanted to break up. He agreed to go camping on Friday night just the two of us with no distractions.

What I didn’t know is that he was plotting on emptying the house while I was at work on Friday instead of going camping like he lead me to believe. I got home from work and immediately noticed the coffee maker was gone.  I went to our bedroom and all of his belongings were gone. 

I called him and he said this was the only way he could get it through to me that he was done. 

We met up last night to give me the house key back and chatted for 1.5 hours that went no where except me in tears feeling distraught.
Haven’t slept or eaten much for 6 days now. He’s left me with the debt of this house and unfinished renovations not to mention a very sad little kitty that misses her person. 

I made my first counselling appointment for next week to help me process everything.

I feel like I’m dying inside.

Milk is milk, right? Let’s say so.

My mistake was trying to achieve the perfect balance of sweet, not acidic, not bitter, in the espresso part of the recipe. I succeeded, but I never really got to the flavor of that latte I enjoy at coffee shops.

One day, I ordered a 3-shot latte, but I asked them to put the 3rd shot into its own cup. When I tasted that, I realized why I never got my home latte to taste the same. Their espresso tasted very acidic, sour to the point that I couldn’t enjoy it as an espresso. But my latte was that perfect taste I’ve been craving.

By the way, that 3rd shot was actually a double shot split into two cups, so I know I got consistent shots.

So, I went home, impatiently waited for a couple of hours so I don’t overdose on espresso, and then I dialed it in to produce that sour double shot. But when I mixed it with steamed milk, it wasn’t sour anymore. It was that similar tasting latte I go to coffee shops for. 

I asked. Apparently it’s the blend of acidity of espresso shot and sweetness of milk that gives that distinct flavor that I enjoy. When you mix sweet espresso and sweetness milk, then you just get a chain coffee shop tasting  latte. 

Took years to get to this. For a long time I gave up but finally got it. Talk to your barista and they can teach you lots. ",2,1757557033.0,espresso,1,0.75,False
1ndx1ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1ndx1ul/had_a_vivid_futuristic_dream_at_13_years_later/,"Had a vivid futuristic dream at 13 — years later, the people from it entered my life","I wake up one day in an apartment, and this apartment was in a high-rise building. I prepared myself a coffee, ate some fruit, and went outside. I got on my motorcycle—it was a super sport bike—and I rode to a hangar located behind the city center. The hangar was completely empty, but I was aware that it belonged to me. Inside, there was only one elevator on the wall. When I arrived, there was a biometric sensor. I scanned it, entered a pin, and then the elevator opened. I got in and went down quite a few floors, but there were only 2 levels: the one I got on and the one I would get off.

When I got off, I saw a room—this room was as big as the hangar, even bigger. Every side of it was covered with plates twice the size of a human, and the room was rectangular. In the middle, there were two semicircles made of hexagons, cut right down the middle by a platform. Under this platform, inside another hexagonal circle, there was a sphere, completely metallic. On the platform itself, four metallic extensions came in from the sides toward the center. Besides that, on the left and right sides of the machine there were servers—supercomputers. At the front, the side I entered from, there was a desk with a normal computer setup of three monitors. A person was sitting there. To the left, four people were monitoring the four servers placed side by side. On the right side, there was a gap between two servers and then two more. Facing those right-side servers, further back in the room, there were three people. On my side, two people. And in the middle, three people preparing the pilot who would use the machine. On top of the machine itself, one person was standing.

Then I walked to the person standing next to the computer and said something. After that, I went to the pilot and spoke with him a little, checked his helmet and suit. Then I went over to the people monitoring the servers on the left. Finally, the person standing on top of the machine began walking toward me when I arrived in front of it. There were glass stairs leading up to the machine. This person was a tall, blonde woman in formal clothing, holding a checklist. Like me, she was doing inspections. She told me, “Our investor will definitely be satisfied with this.” But deep inside, I knew I didn’t like her much. Then, as she joined us, everyone else stepped back. We stood behind the computer, and the pilot stepped onto the machine’s platform.

I told the computer operator to start. Immediately, the metallic sphere beneath the hexagonal barrier began to spin, endlessly. Then the arms started moving, and the upper hexagonal dome began to close. The metallic sphere, along with its hexagonal barrier, rose through the solid platform and came to the point where the four extensions met. At the same time, gravity disappeared in the room, and we all started floating in midair. I was positioned directly in front of the sphere, aligned with it. The only one unaffected by the loss of gravity was the pilot—he still had it.

Then, from the hexagonal-shielded sphere, a bright blue light shone. The moment I saw that light, I felt as if I had lived thousands of different lives. Right after that, everyone suddenly dropped to the floor, and I saw that the pilot had vanished.

I had this dream. Now here’s the interesting part: I experienced this dream in such a vivid, indistinguishable way that I was absolutely convinced it was real. I was around 25 years old in the dream, but when I had it, I was only in the 3rd year of middle school (out of a 4-year system). What’s strange is this: none of the people I saw in that dream, at that time, were people I knew in real life. In fact, I saw them as their older selves. But as I grew up, I ended up meeting them—some in high school, some in university, some through friends of friends. And now, at 22, I’ve met everyone from that dream except for the blonde woman on the platform.

My question to you is: how could I have seen in a dream, back in middle school, the 25-year-old versions of people I didn’t know yet, only to later meet them in real life? Does this possibility make the reality of the dream stronger?",1,1757557023.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

I'm an Iced Coffee fiend, usually, when I go to this Blends Coffee Bar near me, they sell me an Iced White Chocolate Mocha, which I get sometimes with oatmilk (usually whole milk now) and extra caramel. It's the most delicious thing ever, and the white mocha powder they add in is why. It's such a distinct, recognizable flavor. I called them, and unfortunately, they refused to tell me what they used because it is ""against company policy."" Obviously, I didn't push further, said thank you, and hung up.

I bought the Ghirardelli White Chocolate Powder yesterday; it arrived today, but it doesn't taste like it, which is disappointing. It just tastes like sweet milk, with a strong, overbearing white chocolate taste (in a bad way).. I guess? I can't really describe further what it tastes like, it just tastes very artificial and not like white chocolate. I should've noticed when I saw how the Ghirardelli white chocolate powder doesn't mix well unless you use a frother (The Blends Coffee one just melts into the coffee.)

The Blends Coffee white chocolate powder tastes rich; it makes the coffee very creamy, and it's sweet. It isn't overbearing, but the more you add of it, the sweeter it is (I ask for extra.) It's so addictive, and I always order it every time.

I've been doing my research, and there are many white chocolate powders to choose from (Hollander, The Coffee Bean, etc). I did see that the Hollander one is better than Ghirardelli.. but I don't know what it might be, and I don't want to waste my time buying the wrong ones.

1ndwx55,https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/comments/1ndwx55/coffee1tbs_creamer_at_7am_until_lunch/,Coffee...1tbs creamer... at 7am until lunch?,"Hello!

Can I drink my morning **coffee** with 1 tablespoon of creamer (5g of carbs)...**then** do an **Atkins** 30g High Protein Shake at 11:00 for lunch?

Or do I REALLY have to do the shake within 30 minutes of waking up?

My history:

Currently age 57, 5'9"" @ 173. Been plateaued at low 170's for a while. I am on about 550 days of continuous daily workouts...after reading **Younger Next Year** in Feb of 2024...and getting up off the couch at 190 (but down from 243 about 13 years ago). Most of the 550 days of works outs were cardio, but started getting serious with the strength training about 2 months ago, and making sure I get two days of weights per week...cardio the other 5.

Read **Sugarless** in Dec of 2024...started working to cut out and reduce sugars...especially added sugars.

Then, picked up **4HB** this summer (enjoying immensely...read **4HWW** in Feb). I am a slow reader, and have a ways to go...but trying to start some aspects of the **SCD** now...at least by continuing to reduce carbs and added sugars in all foods.

**But as I consider embracing a FULL SCD**, I have questions about the timing of things. I have read the pages about the timing, but don't yet understand Tim's focus in current day podcasts on 16 hour fasts (which I do not want to do) and why in the 4HB he is saying the first meal has to be first thing upon waking.

I don't want to fast. And, I don't want to prevent my body from starting a process by introducing the small amount of creamer...but I would rather wait to consume the Protein shake until 9:15 am...or 11:00...if I can wait that long.

For the last decade, my morning has started with 16 oz of coffee, with creamer. I cut the creamer in half to about 1 tablespoon (this is the 2nd reduction...used to drink about 30 oz of coffee and easily 2-3 tablespoons of creamer).

**Here is my routine:**

* 6:00 am - Wake Up and get to work.
* 7:15 am - coffee/creamer in hand
* 9:15 - Granola bar 15g carbs (6g sugar), 2g protein - this is for 1 bar...used to do 2 (or both) bars last year...I split it over two days...this gets me through to lunch.
* 11:00 - meal drink...last 10 years...it has been slimfast Meal Replacement (not protein shake).
* 3:00 - schools out...eat some peanut butter
* 4:00 - home...workout
* 5:30 supper...usually veggie or salad dinner...frequently with salmon, or eggs and spinach

So...today was the first day I dropped the slim fast meal drink, and went with Atkins High Protein Shake. I drank the shake at 6:30 on the way to school...with in 30 minutes of waking. Usually coffee at 7:15...and was surprisingly NOT STARVING even at 11:00.

**Was that because I did the Protein shake first thing?** Slim Fast Meal Drinks have never held me over that long. And any protein drinks I have incidentally consumed at lunch time never held me over that long either. Is that why it is so important to get the 30g of protein first?

Thanks for reading all this...and for any feedback. Looking forward to joining in on the SCD.",3,1757556623.0,4hourbodyslowcarb,1,1.0,False

Still more debugging to do before I share the build with Coreboot and Libreboot.

To Deguard ignore the ‘AssertionError.’ HAP bit must be enabled in Descriptor. Also, change in the Descriptor 80 to A0 at 0x307.

For Dell Precision 3420 Tower, use Dell 3050 Micro as base. Modify devicetree.cb, romstage.c, [gma-mainboard.ads](http://gma-mainboard.ads), and include new data.vbt to match system specs. In nconfig make sure you choose, ‘Board can contain Coffee Lake CPU.’ To stop the kernel panic when using all 4 ram slots, you must also choose ‘Perform MP Initialization by FSP’ and ‘Always clear all DRAM on regular boot.’

Grub has been unstable. SeaBIOS had issues with TPM. No issues with edk2 (MrChromebox’s fork). I haven’t tried uboot yet.

Currently using edk2 (MrChromebox’s fork) with Fedora.

My AMD FirePro W4100 works with edk2 (MrChromebox’s fork), just need to select ‘Load and Execute OpROMs on PCIe devices.’

The i3-9100T (4-core) with b0 stepping is drop in without any pin mod. All ports and both PCIe x4 and x16 slots working. 

Stepping u0 and r0 require the full pin mod to be safe. Use kapton tape to isolate and either copper foil with conductive adhesive or silver paint for the connection (SKTOCC pin of the CPU socket has to be shorted to the GND, otherwise cpu is not detected and powered on). 

With the Xeon E-2124G (4-core) with u0 stepping, the ports are working but only the PCIe x4 works. This needs further debugging. I’m not convinced this is the same issue that the CoffeeTime modders have. The processor is recognized as the Intel® Xeon® E-2124G @ 3.40GHz, bridge shows 8th Gen Core 4-core Workstation Processor Host Bridge/DRAM Registers \[Coffee Lake S\], and 6th-10th Gen Core Processor PCIe Controller (x16). I ordered an i5-9400 that also has u0 stepping for a comparison. I will additionally be testing to see how the build handles the i5-9400’s 6-cores. 

With the i7-9700T (8-core) with r0 stepping, the ports are also working along with both PCIe slots (x4 and x16). I’ve been running stress tests and so far no issues.

I have a Librebooted Dell 3050 Micro and plan to rebuild it this weekend. I want to see if it will accept the i7-9700T.",1,1757556580.0,coreboot,0,1.0,False
1ndwwhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ndwwhm/i_found_a_dead_guy_in_my_car/,I Found a Dead Guy in my Car,"I know how most of these start. “I’m a normal guy with a normal job, my life is normal.” Well let me tell you what happened to me was NOT.

I don’t have to be to work until 10 most days. I was thanking whatever god that’s up there for this arrangement the whole morning as I nursed the worst hangover of my life. The warmth of my coffee seeped through my thermos as I dragged myself down the stairs of my apartment building. 

My hands were full so I used my pinky to open the back door of my car. I let out a big yawn and set my laptop bag in the back seat. When I went to get in the front seat I jumped back, dropping my coffee and letting out an embarrassingly high pitched shriek. 

Sitting in my passenger was a man. He was wearing a tattered suit. Deep reddish brown stained the once white shirt. His skin was pale and his eyes were stuck in a wide stare.  

I guess… I panicked. I kept having irrational thoughts like, If I call the police would they think it’s me who did this? Was it me who did this? Will I be charged  a crazy fee for calling the ambulance? I can’t even afford my WiFi bill! How could I afford to call an ambulance? He’d still be dead even if I drove him wouldn’t he? 

He would be. That’s what I decided. It wouldn’t change anything to call an ambulance. And it wouldn’t change anything to just drive him. So I’ll just drive him to the hospital, explain the situation and everything would be fine. 

 Swallowing my fear and disgust, I got into the car. I sat rigid in the driver’s seat, I started the car and grabbed the steering wheel. I looked over at him again and cringed at his expression. There were slits in his shirt amongst the blood stains. Stan wounds? With a shakey hand I shut his eyes. His seat belt was already on. 

Did I get plastered and go to the morgue? Where the hell did this guy even come from? 

I shook my head and started on the rout to the hospital. The roads weren’t busy and thankfully I hadn’t hit any stop lights driving through town. I couldn’t believe it, no stops, no nosy pedestrians, no police. 

I took a deep breath and rested my head on the steering wheel. I let my eyes shut and that’s when I heard it. 

Breathing.

My whole body jolted up and i saw him suck in another dreadfully wet breath.  

“Ohhhhh no. No, nope. No-“ I yelled desperately trying to unbuckle myself. 

“You’re going to go in there,”His words came out in airy rasps. “and you’re not going to come out.” 

Finally my thumb found the button and I threw myself out of the car. I mean literally, like I fell onto the pavement. My legs kept moving without my permission and I ran through the automatic doors to the ER. 

The receptionist sat calmly chewing gum and reading over something in front of her. She jumped up as I clamored up to the desk.  “How can I-“

“There’s a-there’s-hmmmm” I couldn’t breathe, my heart was slamming against my chest. “There’s a dead body in my car. I don’t know how it got there-I know! I know I sound crazy, but really there is I don’t know what to do or where it-he?it? I don’t know, please you have to help me” I blubbered. I didn’t think it through at all, what normal person would believe a single thing that I’m saying? 

The woman nodded her head slowly and then said, “okay why don’t you just sit down right over there and we’ll get this figured out.” 

I stared at her, trying to figure out if she believed me but then did what she said. I sat down so that I could look out the doors. The view was obstructed with causation stickers, but it wasn’t long before another person walked through giving me a clear view of my car. 

Maybe my sight is going…maybe it’s my mind, but there isn’t a body there anymore. ",14,1757556565.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

- Mail/call handling\
- Access to meeting spaces\

- “Presence” in premier locations (think Bahrain Bay or Seef) without ongoing overhead\
Personal aside: My first CR application years ago failed because I tried using a home address in Janabiya—a naive move that led to weeks of Sijilat back-and-forth. Virtual offices would have solved it in 48 hours.\

- Sole Proprietorship (with restrictions)**\
Insider tip: The Sijilat portal updates (since March 2025) now flag virtual office addresses by provider license number, so always choose a MOICT-approved virtual office, or risk CR rejection.\
Foreign Ownership Options\
Bahrain allows up to 100% foreign ownership for most activities (retail, IT, consulting) except a few strategic sectors—confirm latest lists via Keylink BH: foreigner-friendly activities and Keylink BH: 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain.\
\
Compared to the UAE, where mainland offices may require a local sponsor or complex flexi-desk setups, Bahrain’s virtual office path is simpler, faster, and often more affordable.\
\
Challenge I faced: Navigating LMRA’s E-key portal for labor approval using a virtual office address—initially flagged for “capacity mismatch.” Solution: Provide a provider-generated tenancy letter and CR-linked utility bill. Saved me two weeks of resubmissions.\

- Services included: mail handling, call answering, meeting access, tenancy/utility proof\
Pro tip: Avoid peak volumes by applying for new CRs on Wednesdays before local holidays—processing is faster, queues are shorter at government buildings.\
2. Reserve Your Address & Obtain the Required Documents\
\
Lease agreement (virtual office contract)\
Tenancy letter (from provider)\
Utility bill (sometimes shared or provider-issued, but must match address)\
Provider trade license copy (for Sijilat verification)\
\
Document shortcut: Many reputable providers (WorkSmart, Regus) now issue digital tenancy letters pre-filled for Sijilat uploads, saving hours of manual paperwork.\
3. Start Your Online Application via Sijilat\
\
Register with Bahrain Sijilat portal (https://www.sijilat.bh/)\
Enter the exact virtual office address—double-check for formatting (typos cause delays!)\
Upload all supporting documents (CR, tenancy, utility, provider license)\
Follow prompts for desired entity type and activity codes (based on MOICT’s approved list)\
\
4. MOICT and LMRA Compliance\
\
After Sijilat pre-approval, follow up with MOICT for any clarifications\
LMRA (labor) approval for companies sponsoring staff—ensure virtual office capacity matches planned headcount\
Some activities (e.g., retail, manufacturing) may not qualify for fully virtual address—seek hybrid packages if needed\
\
5. Post-CR: Activate Mail Handling, Meeting Room Access\
\
Set up forwarding instructions, phone notifications\
Book meeting rooms as needed for investor/client appointments\

“How much does a virtual office cost for Bahrain company formation?”\
Probably the most frequent question I get. And the answer is: It depends—location, provider, and included services drive the fee.\
\
Typical pricing:\
- Basic legal address package: 300–450 BHD/year\
- Full-service package: 500–900 BHD/year (includes mail, calls, limited meeting access)\
- Premium address (e.g., Bahrain Bay, Financial Harbour): 900–1200 BHD/year\
One major pitfall: Entrepreneurs often select the lowest-cost address, unaware that some MOICT officers cross-check for “shared” addresses during random audits. Always confirm your provider’s approval and reputation.\
For updated, detailed breakdowns, see Keylink BH: Bahrain company formation cost.\
Additional government fees (2025 update):\
\
CR application: 50–100 BHD (activity-dependent)\
Sijilat portal fees: 10–15 BHD per submission\
LMRA labor fees: 72 BHD per expat staff member/year\
\
Time-saving hack: Pay all government fees online via BenefitPay during Ramadan—queues at MOICT shrink sharply after 2pm.\
Bahrain’s 2025 Regulatory Update: Virtual Office Rules\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. for audit prep)\
Common mistake: Letting your virtual office lease expire or lapse on government systems—this can instantly invalidate your CR. Set reminder alerts 30 days before renewal.\
Insider Tips: Saving Time, Money, and Reputation\
\
Best locations: Diplomatic Area and Seef for easiest MOICT approvals; Bahrain Bay for attracting high-tier clients\
Optimal timing: Avoid CR renewals or changes in early January—Ministries are swamped with “New Year” backlog\
Document prep: Upload all files as PDF, under 3MB, using provider’s exact template—wrong file types are a common rejection factor\
Networking: Use majlis-style meetings in office lounges to build rapport with local partners—sharing traditional coffee signals respect, especially before Ramadan\
\
My own experience: Once, MOICT flagged my CR for “non-matching address format.” After three rejected attempts, I switched to a bilingual tenancy letter, triple-checked by the provider. Application approved the next morning.\

Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes\
\
Trying to register a new CR with an unlicensed virtual office address\
Failing to renew the virtual office contract on time\
Using non-standard document formats for Sijilat submissions\
Overlooking activity-specific restrictions (e.g., trading vs. consulting) on address eligibility\
\
Prevention strategies:\
- Work only with vetted providers recommended on MOICT or by seasoned consultants\
- Set digital reminders for every renewal and bureaucracy deadline\
- Double-check all uploads—seek a second set of eyes if possible\
- Always clarify with the provider whether your planned activities are 100% virtual-compliant\
Final Thoughts: The Smarter Path to Flexible, Compliant Bahrain Company Formation\
Virtual office solutions aren’t just a “budget hack”—they’re a strategic asset in Bahrain’s pro-business landscape. By aligning your office address, documentation, and timing with local expectations and regulatory updates, you can launch and grow a business here almost as easily as the region’s top business hubs.\
And don’t forget: the best resource is always a strong local network—sometimes, the right cup of Arabic coffee shared in a Seef District lounge will open more doors than any document.\
\

I tried bluetokai's easy pour bags and really liked it, no bitterness, I could drink without adding any sugar

According to my research so far, having a good grinder is important. So if I get a grinder between 4-6k, what would be the brewing options with no other equipment? And with equipment like moka pot, drip coffee machine, etc what would be better?

2nd option, I get an aeropress and already grinded beans for it

Which of these options is better? Initially i thought about french press but read it leaves the coffee a bit muddy and aeropress is better 

Cannot get both the grinder and aeropress at once as it would be too expensive 

Additionally, is there any way to get that cafe like coffee smell in the kitchen? Does that come from espresso machines only? Or a drip coffee machine can do it too?

1ndwqv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ndwqv5/should_i_address_what_happened_at_work_today/,should I address what happened at work today,"Idk if it should be here. So I (26F) am not trans whatsoever, but I have hirsutism. So sometimes I have stubble underneath my chin and I shave every 3-4 days. 

I started this job like three weeks ago. Today, before work, I was in the break room having breakfast when the custodian walked in. Took maybe three steps, saw me, turned around. 


He came back with the manager. They start making coffee. Small talk. Talking about something that happened in Chicago I think? Then change the subject. They were saying something about needing god or jesus or whatever whatever, right? 

So it gets quiet and the manager asks me, “How are you today? How is the job going?” 
I said, “it’s fine.” 

The custodian was going through his phone. Walked up to her, showed her an image of something on his phone without saying a word.

She goes, “…is it?” 

He goes, “I don’t know.” 

“And that’s?” 

“Rachel Levine. He’s…”

“Tran.” yeah not “trans,” but “tran”. Anyways.

Then they take their coffee and leave. 

At this point I’m like, “who is Rachel Levine?” 

I google and it’s the former assistant secretary of health or something like that. A trans woman. 

So I’m like, “Oh, they think I’m a trans woman. That’s so funny.”

So it doesn’t really bother me that they think I’m not a woman, because I only ever shave because I want men to be attracted to me. There’s literally no other reason for me. I’m not attracted to my female manager and I don’t really have the hots for my 54 year old coworker. All of my coworkers are female so I actually care if they think I’m a woman or not. Unless someone felt creeped out and me being around them made them feel uncomfortable because they think I’m a trans woman. Then yeah, I would want them to know that I’m not. But it seems like that’s not the case. 

I’m kind of scared because I can tell the manager doesn’t like me and I’m not doing a super great job. I feel as though they may have kept me on because they want to avoid a lawsuit of discrimination. It feels more and more like that everyday. 

Should I address the situation to them or just let it be? Again, I don’t think I care that they think I’m a man, but I also don’t want anyone to be uncomfortable.

In about 3 months, my family and I are finally moving to a farm — something I’ve been dreaming about for years. I work as a developer and run my own saas/app company developing indie projects. I’ve been fully remote for over 10 years. My daily routine is just waking up, grabbing coffee, and heading to my home office… and now that office will be surrounded by trees, fresh air, and open space.

The only reason this is even possible is because we finally have decent internet where we’re going (thank you, Stalink!).

Right now, I’m just imagining all the upsides:

* No more city noise or traffic.
* Space for my kids to run around and actually be kids.
* A calmer lifestyle and (hopefully) lower stress levels.
* More time to focus on building cool projects without the constant rush.
* Create animals and plants as hobbies.

But I’m wondering — am I only seeing the good side here?

For anyone who already moved to the countryside or is thinking about it:

* What are the downsides nobody talks about?
* Anything you wish you knew before making this move?

Would love to hear from people around the world who’ve done this (or want to) — the good, the bad, and the “wish I’d known this earlier.” Thanks!",1,1757555803.0,TheFounders,2,1.0,False

I’m moving to Oakland and have toured a few apartments, but I’d love to hear honest feedback from people who’ve lived in them, visited, or just know the neighborhoods well. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what day-to-day life would really feel like.

How I’m feeling about the apartments so far:

	•	1717 Webster → Just felt “meh” to me

	•	Pros/cons of these specific buildings or their neighborhoods
	•	Safety, noise, management, and maintenance
	•	Any hidden costs or quirks you’ve run into
	•	The vibe: social vs. quiet, places nearby worth walking to, actual food/coffee recs
	•	Whether you think the value matches the rent in these buildings

I’ve already toured them, but outside perspectives are really valuable. Would love to know what you think or what you wish you’d known before choosing a place here.

Thanks so much!

They say, “Grief is the price you pay for love.”  
They say, “Grief is love with no place to go.”  
They say a lot of wildly unhelpful bullshit.  
None of it helps when it’s 3 a.m. and the walls are closing in.

When I was pregnant with my first, my mother in law said, “You’ll never sleep again.” Her tone exuding more joy than pity. Turns out the bitch was right. Only, I slept great when I had a newborn. It was only *after* she turned ten that my real sleep issues began. 

If grief is the price you pay for love, I’ll counter that with, ‘Insomnia is the price you pay for grief.’ Every night I toss and turn like the princess and the pea. But, in my case, the pea isn’t some hidden vegetable causing a lump in my mattress, it’s the mounding self-hatred for what I’ve done, or what I failed to do, that keeps me up at night. 

Grief being “love with no place to go?” Now that takes flippant stupidity to a whole new level. Grief has plenty of places it likes to show up. In the checkout line at the grocery store when you’re buying Super Plus tampons. When a telemarketer calls asking if you’d like the chance to win a free trip to Disneyland. Or in the crick of your neck as you wiggle into a sports bra for a spin class that you’ll sob the whole way through. 

Grief will follow you anywhere and everywhere. Even to Montecito. 

Count the sheep, all the money in your bank account, the number of lovers you’ve had.

Buy the $20K Ralph Lauren Brook Street bed.

Chase a tiny blue Trazadone with a half a bottle of Sav Blanc. 

You still end up staring at the clock all night. Tick. Tick. Tick. **SPASH**!

Because you can’t sleep if you don’t have a clear conscience. 

The houses here look like Nancy Myers sets. And the women look like Gwyneth Paltrow Fuck, the women ARE Gwyneth Paltrow. Leaning over the hedge from her backyard to yours for the occasional borrowed lemon. 

Everything here smells like jasmine, everything sounds like the sea. But behind the stucco walls, the air reeks of guilt. And secrets seeping through like damp rot. 

I should know. I buried three friends in less than a year.

And buried my son the year before that.

That’s a hell of a lot of rot.

**The Drowning**

My name is Reese. Before Montecito, I worked as a chef in Beijing with my husband, Jacob, and our two children. My son, Sammy, was six. My daughter, Mandy, ten.

They say, “*Life happens when you’re busy making other plans*.”

But really, life happens when you’re busy looking the other way. Sammy was splashing in the rooftop pool while Mandy, her arm still in a cast from last month’s break, sat at the edge brushing her doll’s hair with her one good arm. 

“Stop splashing me! I can’t get my cast wet!” Ever since she turned ten, Mandy had become very serious. Things, like a splash of pool water, had never bothered her before. Now everything Sammy did was a total and utter annoyance. I told Mandy to keep an eye on Sammy while I ran downstairs to check on the cake I was baking to celebrate him turning six. Mandy promised they’d stay at the edge of the pool until I got back. And I chose to believe her.

*But kids don’t always do what they say they will*. 

When I returned with the cake, I saw Mandy first. Kneeling next to the pool. Panic twisting her not-so-cherub face. Sammy was floating face down in his purple swim trunks. Like a discarded toy. I don’t remember anything after that, only what they told me later. I had dived in to pull him out and nearly broken my neck. 

I was shocked back into reality by the touch of the cold stiff body I was left holding in my arms. I thought, “If I hold him tight enough, if I warm him up, then I can bring him back.”

But he was already gone by then.

And Mandy… my daughter just kneeled there. Watching. She’d tried to pull him up but she said he was too heavy. She just kept repeating, “Dad said not to get my cast wet.” No ten year old could’ve lifted him using only one arm\*. But was she really so afraid of her father that she refused to save her baby brother?\*

After the funeral, Jacob left us. Did you know that 80% of couples who lose a child divorce? I read that somewhere. Or maybe I made it up so that I would feel less alone.

Living in our condo after Sammy and Jacob were gone all I could see was gray. 

Gray sky. 

Gray appliances. 

Gray people.

Gray life.

So we left. I told Mandy we needed to “start over.” Bought us one-way tickets to LAX and rode the air bus up to Montecito which only took an hour and a half. I’d read about Montecito in a magazine. It’s called the American Riviera because it’s like living in the south of France. Without the language barrier and the slow bureaucracy. 

“Unincorporated. Only one stop light in town. Montecito doesn’t even have its own police department.” Some people would consider that a downside. But I knew it was exactly what Mandy and I needed.

Arriving in Montecito the world felt different. Everything was now in technicolor. Like landing in Oz after the tornado. I no longer saw gray. It was blue, and green, and…purple.

I met Shari first. She was walking past our bougainvillea vined fence with the perfectly styled cunty little bob. 4 karat diamond studs holding it behind her ear. 

“I’m so happy you moved in! Now I won’t have to see that Ugly-Devil-Gerby-Baby on my walks anymore.” I glanced around for a child before realizing she meant the stone angel statue the movers were setting in the garden. The former owners had asked if I wanted to keep it but after Shari’s harsh verdict I told the movers to haul it off immediately.

Shari asked me to join “the girls” at the Coral Casino for brunch. I turned her down politely saying I needed to stay and help the movers. “Worried they’ll steal? Watch them on your ring.”  I gave an apologetic smile to the men who’d obviously overheard. “Bethica’s daughter is your daughters age! Shellian’s a great “in” if your daughter plans on having any kind of social life.” If anyone needed an “in” it was Mandy. Before Sammy’s accident she was noticeably shy but after, she seemed almost translucent. 

I told Shari I’d see them at the Coral at ten and rushed in the house to tell Mandy. As I walked up the stairs, I heard muffled voices from behind Mandy’s closed door. “I know I should but I don’t think she would understand. She doesn’t get it!” 

*What wouldn’t I get?*

I quickly opened her door. Mandy was sitting in front of her vanity applying a wing tip liner to her eyes. She looked up, surprised to see me. “Who were you talking to?”

“Huh?” She blinked back her confusion leaving black ink in the creases of her eyes.

I knew I had to tread lightly, “You weren’t talking to dad, were you?”

“*Why* *would I be talking to dad*?”

I looked at her face for signs that she was lying but with Mandy there were no ‘tells.’ Not like Sammy who pulled at his lip anytime he tried to fib.

“Do you want a sandwich before I head out?” I sat down on the bed, straightening imaginary creases on her comforter. “I’m meeting some women in town for brunch. One has a daughter in your class. A potential new friend!”

Mandy looked skeptical. “She’s probably some stuck up bitch.”

“Mandy, you gotta be open! This is a chance to start over. Aren’t you ready to be happy again?” Mandy didn’t answer. But her face seemed to say, “Happy? What’s that?”

“Nana used to say, “If you perform the life you want well enough, eventually that’ll be your life. Whether it’s true or not.” Mandy groaned, “What’s that even mean?”

I tried to sound cheerier than I felt, “Fake it till you make it! One day, you won’t have to fake it anymore.” Mandy smirked, “Fake being happy. Got it.”

Before I could object to her twisting my words, a LOUD BANG rattled the front door. I hurried down the stairs, my feet slipping on the damp steps. “Mandy, why are the stairs wet?!” Before she could answer before the front door creaked open on its own. “Knock knock!” A mousy haired woman entered carrying a tray of muffins on a Dixie plate. She looked like the Temu version of Shari. More Old Navy than Chloe. 

“Aunt Annie’s Roadkill Muffins. Apple walnut oat. I made a batch for the church last week and froze them. Figured I had to bring something if I was going to come introduce myself. I’m Karen.” Karen had the kind of voice that instantly makes you feel claustrophobic. Like you should start planning an exit strategy. Unfortunately, I was in my own home. I eyed the muffins. Yep, they were definitely a week old. She called it a welcoming gift but it was really a cover. Karen wanted the scoop on Mandy and me for the paper. “You write for the LA Times?” I asked.  

Karen looked embarrassed. “The Montecito Journal. It’s a free paper. Comes out Thursdays. You can find one outside of the coffee shop in town.” Karen didn’t get paid for her writing but that didn’t matter. It gave her access into other people’s lives that she was unable to get through true friendships. “I’d love to do a writeup on your family. Is it just you and your daughter or….?” She let the question hang there like she had already gone through my mail and knew that Jacob was no longer in our lives.

I had to get her out of my house before Mandy heard her ask anything else, “I’m so sorry I’d love to talk but I’m heading out to brunch. With Bethica Mandeville.”

“Wow. You’ve been here 24 hours and Bethica’s already let you into her little group? I’ve lived here my whole life and those women have only said five words to me.” I waited. Karen counted on her fingers as she spoke, “No. We. Don’t. Have. Room.”

**BEIGE IS THE NEW BLACK**

I met Shari at the valet. Poppy arrived in beige, matching her tan Range Rover. Bethica wore a cream scarf with her cream Rivian. The women in town seemed to be in some sort of unspoken contest as to who could appear coldest in 74 degree weather.

The Coral Casino, like most things in Montecito, wasn’t what it seemed. Not a casino at all but instead a prestigious beach club that wouldn’t get you in without a $250,000 membership or an invite from someone willing to pay your guest fee. When the Waiter passed us our menus, Bethica turned him away, “Breakfast is for children and fat people.” I chewed on the rind of my lemon hoping to silence my growing hunger.

Poppy, an ex-soap star from “The Sun Also Rises,” was glamourous, magnetic, and obsessed with social media. An ex addict, “Rehab. Threepeat offender” who still slipped mushrooms in her smoothies for “therapeutic purposes.” She cared more about her follower count numbers than the amount of friends she had in the room. She promised to “help me rebrand” my life.

Bethica was harder to read. The self-proclaimed “First lady of real estate in Montecito.” She knew everything about everyone in town. “Marital status, credit score, drug of choice.”  The power she wielded lied in the unspoken knowledge that she could tell someone how much you have in your savings account after too much wine at a PTA meeting. Bethica had sharp eyes which she closed when she spoke as if speaking to others was utterly exhausting. She asked questions she already knew the answers to just to see if you would tell her the truth. 

Half way through my second glass of wine, a woman in her 60s walked into the club. Everyone turned to look. Muffled whispers spread throughout the room. “What’s she doing here? I thought she was moving?” The air in the room had changed. *What made her so special?* “Who’s that? The richest woman in town or something?”

“More like the saddest.” Shari answered. 

“Her daughter Sophie died in the 2018 mudslide.” Poppy said, her eyes welling up Soap Opera style. Bethica was less sympathetic. “Caroline Collins. Before the mudslide she was a social pariah. Cheated on her husband, Kyle, who everyone adored. He divorced her. He kept the house and their social circle.”

After Sophie died, Caroline became the ethereal symbol of anguish in Montecito. The mud wiped away her house *and* her social debts. Caroline shot Bethica a look so full of hatred I had to wonder if she had lipread what Bethica said. Bethica returned her stare with a self-satisfied smirk. “Careful, honey. Wealth whispers.” But Caroline didn’t look afraid of Bethica. She looked angry.

Bethica turned her attention back to me. She seemed unimpressed with my job *and* lack of alimony. “Being a personal chef is basically 21^(h) Century slavery.” Then she got to the question I knew she’d wanted to ask before the waiter had even pulled out my chair. “So, why’d you ditch the ex in China to move to Mayberry with money?””

I glanced at Caroline, thinking about the pseudo-sympathy they’d offered knowing her trauma. I thought of Mandy, and how badly she needed a friend, how much I wanted her to be happy, and I knew it was time to tell them about Sammy. 

About Mandy’s survivor’s guilt…. 

Aaaannd…about the new cookbook I was writing. “Turning Grief to Gourmet!” 

And with that, I’d done it. I’d sealed my place within the elite friend group. My grief story became my ticket into their hearts. And my ambition to overcoming that grief would become my redemption arc. 

**HILTON**

And what better way to round out that arc than with a new love interest? We bumped into Hilton on his way into the club for a game of pickleball. He was wearing head-to-toe James Perse and a casual smile. “Impossible. You girls let in a fourth? I thought there was only- (kissing Shari hello) Earth- (pointing at Poppy) Wind- (pointing at Bethica) and fire. I guess that makes you water.”

“That’s a compound.” I said. *I mean, I was pretty sure it was*. I was trying my best to show that I could keep up with his wit. I hadn’t been properly flirted with in ages.

Hilton bounced the proverbial wit right back to me. “Much more complicated than the other elements. You mustbe special. Bethica wouldn’t let Poppy in til she won Dancing with the Stars.” Hilton offered me a ride home after Shari said she had to get on a call with the “Dutchess of Difficult.” She gave me a wink and leaned in, “Go for it. He’s in the 1% of the dating pool here. Montecito’s full of the newly wed and nearly dead. He’s neither.” 

I slammed the door to his Jaguar as Caroline Collins walked out. Seeing me with Hilton, she sent me a silent plea with her eyes, “Use caution.” I chose to ignore the warning. Hilton was handsome, charming, and (let’s face it) I hadn’t been laid since before Sammy died. Besides, the kind of sex that Jacob and I had wasn’t exactly the kind a woman misses. I had a feeling many, many, women missed Hilton. 

We drove with the top down as he pointed out the sights. Hilton was a self-proclaimed “Cito Rat.” Born and raised in Montecito, he had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks but worked his way to the “right side” through contractor work on the multi-million dollar houses being sold every other hour in town. “I do Bethica’s dirty work fixing up the houses that she then sells for three times what they were worth before.” 

He was also her ex-husband. 

**Death #1: Karen**

The morning Karen died, she had called me to rat out Mandy. “I saw her riding on the back of Shellian’s purplee-bike! And she wasn’t wearing a helmet!” Karen said she’d done a write-up in the paper a couple weeks earlier about the dangers of e-bikes. “No one’s going to listen me until someone ends up dead!”

When Shellian picked Mandy up that morning for school, I made her swear not to ride on the bike. Shellian seemed embarrassed on behalf of Mandy saying, “No e-bike, we get it.” She walked it next to Mandy as they headed down the driveway. 

But, like I said before, *kids don’t always do what they say they’ll do*.

After Karen’s urgent call, I’d driven straight to the school. I found Shellian’s e-bike parked near the front lot. After taking a quick look around, I wrestled it into the back of my car for safe keeping. It’d only be until I was sure the girls would listen to me. 

*I had to protect Mandy*. 

Karen came up to my car window in the school pick up line and shoved a notecard with her Aunt’s recipe into my hand. “It’s for your grief cookbook!” I accepted it with a sigh. The muffins had been shit. Just like everything else Karen touched. 

I didn’t have time to cover the bike. *Had she seen it*?

Then she started in about Sammy’s death. Saying it was important for her story. “It will give it heart, open up doors to new friendships.” I told her I had enough friends and to, “Leave it alone. We came here for a fresh start, not to dwell on the past.”

Mandy got into the car as Karen was giving me a funny look and saying, “*Dwell* on your son’s death? That’s a funny way to put it.”

Just hearing her brother’s name said aloud Mandy turned an angry shade of red that frightened me. “Listen you fucking snoop-“ I rolled up the window before Mandy could finish. Later that night I received a text from Karen asking for me to join her at Douglas bluffs for wine at sunset. “We don’t even have to talk about *you know what*.” She texted and texted all night. I hit “ignore” on her final call to me.

Karen’s body was found at the bottom of the bluffs the next morning. Shellian’s purple e-bike lying on top of her crumpled body. A tube sock shoved deep inside her mouth. A symbol. Someone wanted her to stop talking and whoever it was knew that the e-bike was in my car. They called it a drunken accident even though it was clear she’d been murdered. Montecito likes to keep its tragedies clean. 

Housing prices go *down* when crime goes *up*.

**DR PILL PUSHER**

Like I said. I couldn’t sleep. And my neck was getting worse and worse. Bethica gave me the number of a guy she called Dr. Pill Pusher. “He refills Shellian’s Adderall prescription on an endless loop. “I put her on it at 8- to keep her weight down. He’ll give you whatever you want. No questions asked.” 

Dr Pill Pusher looked like he should have retired years ago. He immediately offered me unlimited refills of Percocet and a number to support meetings for grieving parents. He thought that my neck pain was tied to the emotional trauma of losing Sammy.

That night I popped two pills, hoping to sleep through the night, but woke at 2 a.m. with racing thoughts. *What happened to Karen*? *How did whoever killed her get Shellian’s bike from my car*? *Should we be scared?*

I stared out the kitchen window, drinking glass after glass of water. Fill it, drink it, fill it, drink it. My reflection stared back. *Why couldn’t I sleep? I barely liked Karen why would I grieve her*? Then my reflection shifted. Bloated, bruised, and unmistakably…

**Karen**. Her eyes pleaded, “*What happened to me*?” I tried to blink her away but it didn’t work. She raised a finger pointing at me. Or *behind* me.

A small voice whispered, “What are you doing?” I jumped out of my skin. Dropping my water glass on the floor and shattering it into hundreds of tiny, shards of translucent glass.  Mandy stood behind me. A look of worry mixed with irritation on her face.  “The pills I got for my neck. They’re making me thirsty.” Mandy stared at me a moment then turned on her socked heels to go upstairs. “You didn’t take Shellian’s bike out the other night, did you? To try and sneak it back to her?”

Mandy’s eyes turned dark. “No, mom. *I* didn’t.”

**SAD MEETINGS FOR SAD PEOPLE**

I walked into the grief meeting at All Saints By the Sea and took a seat. Hoping no one would notice me. The parents around me shared the same empty posture. Like a bunch of deflated balloons who lost all of their air the day that they buried their child.

Fred was mid-share. He’d lost his adult daughter to suicide. “She was in pain. Pain that I wasn’t equipped to fix. Dads can fix a lot of things. But I couldn’t fix the hole in her heart.”  Caroline Collins popped a cough drop into her mouth angrily, “Ill-equipped. What an eloquent way to say that we failed.”

The group leader was a rich pseudo-hippy named Tabitha who wore flare Paige jeans and stacked jewelry that cost more than my first car.  “Caroline, how do you feel that you failed?” 

Caroline shifted in her seat, irritated. Maybe it wsa the shitty folding chair she was stuck sitting in, or maybe it was just at life. “Sophie and I went to bed January 9th knowing that rain was coming. But we had no idea that we were living in a house that would be nothing but a floating piece of scrap wood by daylight.” 

There were some knowing nods on either side of me. Obviously having lived through the Thomas Fire and mudslides that followed when it hit Montecito. “We locked eyes and she said, “Mom, what do we do?” And all I could say was, ‘Hold on.’ And she did. We got pulled into the creek clasping one another’s hands. But the current was stronger than us. I got tangled into a tree. Nearly tore off my arm. But Sophie kept going. She was found in the surf by the bluffs. Cold, broken, alone.”

Tears fell from my face. It took everything in my power not to break down into heavy ugly sobs. I imagined Sophie in the sand of the bluffs. Hand outstretched reaching for her mother. Like a lost little girl. But slowly her face dissolved into Karen’s. The purple e-bike lying on top of her. Sock shoved deep in her mouth.

Another woman, Amy, interrupted my train of thought.  “I’d a never  bought a house on a creek. Too noisy.”  Amy had decided she qualified for grief meetings when her son decided he couldn’t have a relationship with a mother who’d voted for Trump. “He’s dead to me now.” Her total lack of empathy was probably the bigger factor in her gay son cutting ties with Amy. But it was easier for her to blame her politics.

Caroline wrang her hands angrily. “You’re right, Amy. I never should’ve bought a house on the creek. But the person who sold me the house knew it wasn’t built to withhold years on that land. But they happily took my money. I would’ve done anything to protect Sophie. But I couldn’t. Not from them.”

*Them*? Them who?

Tabitha interrupted my thoughts. “Newbie, would you like to share?” I  didn’t. I actually wanted to run from the room. Separating myself from being clumped into this angry, sad, depressing group of people. But I stayed, rolling my neck (fuck it was hurting) and speaking with a shaky voice that I almost didn’t recognize. “I’m Reese. A year ago, I lost my son. Sammy. He was six. It was a swimming accident. He drowned, he dry-drowned, holding his breath. My daughter, Mandy, jumped in to save him but he was too heavy. I jumped in. Almost broke my neck.” 

Caroline rubbed her arm, remembering her own pain trying to save Sophie. “I kept thinking, *If I get him warm, if I dry him off, he’ll be okay.* They took his body away, and I held my daughter. All I could think was, *She’s so dry, so warm… and he’s so cold. Why can’t he be warm like Mandy?* I don’t know why, but that thought just stuck with me.”

A strange look came over Caroline’s face. Something about my story wasn’t sitting right. She waited until the end of the meeting to approach me. “Be careful of who you trust your stories with around here. Some people may use them against you.”

She walked out before I could ask her who she meant.

**SEX AND SECRETS**

The girls had decided to throw a gala to bring awareness to “Dry-drowning.” The official ‘cause of death’ listed on Sammy’s autopsy. “Nobody knows what the fuck dry drowning is. I had to google it.” Bethica lamented. They had agreed to call the foundation “Sammy’s Smile.” The gala would go hand in hand with the release of my cookbook, Grief to Gourmet.

Mandy called it ‘Grief Porn.” She asked how I could agree to this type of public exposure. “Didn’t we come here to get away from dad? If he finds out---""

“He won’t find out.” Mandy had seen how Jacob reacted when Sammy’s drowned. How angry he was at her. How angry he was at me. She had every reason to be afraid.

Hilton invited me to come check out his house so I could see the space we’d be using for the gala. Or at least that was the official reason I was asked to come.

He walked me across the sweeping expanse of his impossibly green lawn, past his Schumacher wallpaper lined library, and into his media room- complete with a concession stand. He put on The Graduate and, as I reclined in the red velvet theater chair, I knew I wasn’t leaving without climbing onto his lap to fuck him first.

After a rinse off in the double headed shower, I walked ahead of him, towel-drying my hair, he suddenly screamed out, “Reese, Stop!”

I almost laughed, thinking he was joking, until I saw a gaping hole less than a foot in front of me. It was covered by a clear plastic tarp. “You’re standing over the atrium. A glass ceiling. It’s not finished!” He coaxed me back to him with an outreached hand just as a door  below us slammed. “Hil? Hellllo?!” a shrill voice called up the stairs.

“Bethica! What’s she doing here at ten o’clock at night?” The last person I wanted to have to do the walk of shame in front of was Bethica. An ex is an ex no matter how superficially cordial of an act they put on.

“She had some contracts she wanted me to look over. I had no idea she’d want those done tonight.” I searched his eyes, was he telling the truth? Or could it be the ‘cordial act’ they put on was *more* than cordial? 

“Is there another way out? Bethica’s the last person I want to see right now.” Hilton ushered me to the back staircase and gave me quick kiss before walking down the hallway to the front stairs. When I heard him get to the landing Bethica sighed dramatically, “There you are! I brought those contracts for you to go over.” 

I felt a sense of relief. He had been telling the truth. “I was in the shower.” I peeked from my spot at the bottom of the stairs and saw them standing in the kitchen. Bethica was ruffling his wet hair flirtatiously. “I can see that.” I felt a pang of jealousy. Yuck. I quietly opened the  backdoor when Bethica said something that stopped me dead in my tracks. “Caroline Collins is breathing down my neck again.” I leaned in. Caroline? 

Hilton whispered urgently, “So just give her whatever she’s asking!” I quickly realized the only reason he would whisper like that is if he thought I may still be in the house. He was afraid of what I’d hear. Bethica snorted, “She’s asking for a public apology.“ 

There was a long pause then Hilton asked, “Are you ready to give her that?”

“Are *you*? I thought all the lawsuit B.S would be put to bed with Karen gone.” Bethica sounded more annoyed than afraid. Hilton cleared his throat, “Who else knows?” Bethica was hesitant, “Poppy. But she was wasted when I told her. I wouldn’t worry.”

I felt sick to my stomach. *Bethica and Hilton were involved in Sophie’s death?* And Poppy knew.  *Had Karen known*? *Is that why she was dead*? I snuck out the backdoor before I would be forced to hear more. 

**MANDY**

I tiptoed into the house and bumped straight into Mandy. “What are you doing up?” I ran my fingers through my hair. Hoping that the shower had erased any smell of all the insanely good sex that I’d just had.

“Where were you?” She asked. Eyes seeing through me like she already knew. “With the girls.” I glanced down at the book she was reading. “Everything I Never Told You” by Celeste Ng. “What’re you working on?”

“Book report. It’s about this Chinese family. The middle sister drowns.” She looked at me as if she wanted me to have some big reaction. I tried to keep my voice as casual as possible. “How did she drown?”

“She’s scared of water. But she wants to impress her parents, they’re like really intense, so she goes swimming in the lake. Then she drowns. Just like Sammy.” She turned a page and used her purple highlighter to underline a passage.  My voice was shaking, “Sammy didn’t drown trying to impress me.”

“Sure he did. Don’t you remember?” She changed the pitch of her voice to sound more like Sammy, “*Mommy, watch me hold my breath! Watch me, mom*.’” 

I felt the heat in my cheeks rising. It took everything in me to steady my voice and not fall to my knees. “Mandy, sometimes you can be so cruel.”

She capped the pen and looked right at me. “It’s not my fault you have selective memory.”  I reached for my bottle of Percocet but when I turned it over several  chewable Vitamin Cs landed in my hand. “Mandy, did you take my pills?” 

Mandy looked from me to the pill bottle. Then put on her most defiant voice. “You probably did it during one of your sleep walking episodes.” I tried not to sound defensive, “Sleepwalking episodes, what’re you talking about?” 

“The chugging water, staring out the window all creepy, in the middle of the night. Or when you think I’m talking on the phone when I’m clearly not.”

“Mandy, don’t gaslight me.” 

“I didn’t take the damn pain pills. I prefer *uppers* not downers.”

“What? Have you been taking Shellian’s Adderall? I want the truth!”

Mandy slammed the book shut. “Until you can start being honest with me I’m done being honest with you.”

**Death #2: Poppy**

Poppy came over to help me get the “Sammy’s Smile” Instagram up and running. “Content night,” she called it. She started by taking down photos of all the food I had posted on my Instagram and inserting more photos of Sammy. 

That’s when she found Jacob’s Instagram account. **FREEJACOB1**.

I had forgotten to un-tag Jacob from a photo of Sammy. Gapped toothed and blowing a pink bubble. With that one mistake, Poppy now had an all-access pass into all of the details about my ex that I had purposely omitted from our friendship. 

“I’m in the Forbidden City. Alone but the walls bulge with ghosts. This palace isn’t a palace at all. It’s a prison. They left me here, didn’t they? Abandoned. Secrets crawling through my veins. I’m the true ghost now. Recognize me?”

“Oh shit.” Poppy’s mink-lashed eyes fluttered in disbelief. “He really lost it.”

Mandy walked into the house just  as Poppy clicked on a photo of her father’s emotionally damaged face. She raced up the stairs and slammed her door.  I ran after her as she screamed, “Stop her or she’ll find out everything!”

That night as I scrolled through the Sammy’s Smile Instagram and saw a new DM. 

**FREEJACOB1** “*Monotonizing on our son’s death*.” He included a photo of him leaning against a Palm Tree. #paradise.

There aren’t Palm Trees in China. He knew where we were. He had found us.

I asked Poppy to go on a hike the day before she died. I thought it’d be nice to offer up an activity that didn’t revolve around drinking. Every occasion in this town seemed to come with a monogrammed glass of Veuve champagne.  Poppy had offered me her recipe for her Mushroom Detox smoothies to use in my cookbook so I’d blended us up two thermoses to celebrate when we reached the top of the mountain. 

I’d only used half of the recommended dose of psilocybin. I’d never used mushrooms before and didn’t want to find out how I’d react when I was 3 miles up a steep ravine. Just as we were got to the peak overlooking Montecito, Poppy admitted something to me. “I had an  affair with Greer. Back when I was using.”

“Does Shari know?” 

“No. AA says to only make amends if it will not cause further damage to the person you’ve wronged. Shari has had a rough year. With Matilda transitioning to Matty and all. She puts on a brave face but I know this would kill her. But Bethica knows.”

“Aren’t you afraid she’ll tell Shari?”

“She’s got her own secrets she doesn’t want out.”

I wanted to find a way to tell her that I already knew, “I don’t think secrets don’t stay secrets for long in this town.” Poppy looked at me. “Not even when you come all the way from China to hide them.”

My head snapped to look at Poppy. “Hiding? What am I hiding?”

Poppy came clean. “I did a deep dive on Jacob. I couldn’t help myself It was hard because, China news and all, but I know what he said about Sammy’s death. Did he blame you...and Mandy.” I played dumb. To see how much he knew, “What do you mean?”

“Jacob said it was your fault.”

“It wasn’t Mandy’s fault. Jacob told her not to get her cast wet.”

She took a breath then said, “Reese, why did Jacob go to jail?”

I was at a loss for words, and frankly, irritated as hell. So I said the only thing I could think of to avoid having to answer. “Why’d you set the Instagram to public? You swore it’d be private…Have you relapsed?”

Standing at the edge of the cliff Poppy looked very small. I was so angry I could have shoved her from the cliff then and there. She vehemently denied changing the account settings. “I had a slip. I’m sorry.”

Hearing her own-up to what she did quieted my brain. It was an accident. She made a mistake. “Let’s forget it. Here, I made us Detox smoothies from the recipe you gave me to celebrate when we reached the top!” I handed her a thermos.  “To Paradise!” Poppy clinked my cup. “To paradise.” 

Less than 12 hours later Poppy was dead.

Bethica, Shari, and I found her body balled up on the floor at her Holistic Haven clinic the next day. She had relapsed. Overdosed on pills. 

A purple sock shoved deep into her mouth. Red foam soaking the edges. Everyone in town called it auto-erotica gone wrong. It was a far more glamourous cause of death than a simple overdose.  Edgy. Dramatic. 

The way that Poppy would have liked to be remembered. ",1,1757555447.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Chapter Seven – The Last Page

Elena stared at the message on her phone “Will you survive saying it out loud?” and felt a strange calm settle over her. For the first time in her life, she realized that the question wasn’t about fear, it was about courage. Every night of swallowing secrets, every time she had looked the other way, every unspoken memory of Isabel, Rosa, or herself had led to this moment.

The next morning, she didn’t go to work. Instead, she carried the journal, heavy in her hands, to the local community center. The same place she had once attended poetry nights as a teenager, when the world felt small and safe. The auditorium smelled faintly of old wood and coffee, and folding chairs were scattered across the floor. She approached the microphone, feeling the tremor in her hands, the weight of the past pressing down like gravity.

“My name is Elena Torres. I have something to say,” she began, her voice shaky but clear. She paused, took a breath, and opened the journal.

She read first about Isabel, the girl who survived one foster home after another, whose quiet strength had been invisible to everyone but the diary. Then she spoke of Marisol, Rosa, the cousins, the friends, the neighbors whose silence had hidden decades of abuse. Elena read her own memories aloud, memories she had buried so deep she thought they were gone: the night at fifteen, the stepfather, the lost friend, the unspoken shame.

The room was silent at first. Heavy silence, the kind that presses into your chest and makes every heartbeat thunder in your ears. People shifted in their chairs, some gripping hands, some clutching the edges of their sleeves.

Then, from the back of the room, a soft voice broke: “Me too.”

Another followed. And another. Slowly, quietly, one by one, women and men began standing, some crying, some shaking, sharing pieces of themselves, names, events, moments they had never spoken aloud. The silence that had protected abusers and hidden the truth was crumbling in real time.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 31M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

This is my first date that that I am going on after being assaulted (for sake of keeping this safe not going into details) and I want to know how to tell if this is going to be a positive interaction prior to actually going on the date.

We have been casually talking for a week, but I have known of him for at least two years, as he went to the neighbouring university to the one I attended. He was very positively involved with the university, and from doing background research, I can’t find anything remotely negative about him from anyone. We haven’t talked too much- I think mostly because he is working and goes to the gym often, but he has asked me to meet him for coffee (I hate coffee but am willing to find something else to try) at a cafe near me on Friday. He has not set a date or time and I haven’t heard much from him today, so I’m starting to get a little weary.

How much do people tell about themselves to someone on the first date? Do you mention being autistic/having ptsd? What conversations should I stay away from, and what are red flags that I should leave the date? I plan on talking to my therapist tomorrow about how to approach this, but I thought I would ask some other autistic people for opinions and advice.

**For both of our safety:** Let's exchange pictures of ourselves in DMs (we can also do it on TG or WhatsApp, if you want). Just to be sure we can trust each other. If we end up both being attracted to each other by seeing our pictures, then let's go for it! Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

Recently I have been also realising that I may have been sexually abused by her as well.. no physical touch, but some very wierd memories keep going through my mind, and I needed to share.

I cannot go through all the details but my mother (clearly autistic too), always spoke very openly about sex in the house. She would tell me about sex from a very young age, and i remember she gave me a childrens book that was very graphic, showing penetration and other very implicit stuff. From memory, this book was very innapropriate for my age. I was around 5. One day I brought the book to my friends house, and their mom was FURIOUS. I was then told not to go to their house for a month. My mother was upset, and would vent it out to me, as if I could understand her.

She would walk around the house naked, take baths with the door open, and always talked to me in a very.. flirty way. I was asking questions about her pubic hair, and she was VERY open about it. Later in my life she would put on very light clothing that was see through, and we could clearly see her nipples. She would dress like that in front of my friends and family, and still does.

At around 10 years old I started having sexual relationships with guys that were 5 year older than me that lived across my house. They were way too old for me and I was made into doing wierd stuff. I was in love with one of them and my mother would often ask questions about our sexual life. I think she was trying to educate me about it in a way, but looking back she always seemed exited by it, and would kinda mock me.

Many years later, during a dinner with my current partner at my parents house, I was showing them pictures of old friends, now that they were adults. When i got to the guy I was in love with (the guy that was too old for me) she started saying that i « wanted to have sex with him when I was young!». I was uncomfortable and I told her, but she was laughing, and mocking me in front of my dad and partner.

Around the same age she offered me white panties for Christmas, saying in front of my whole family that they were for me to wear for my boyfriend. I repeat, I was around 10 year old. Nobidy said anything..

She would often tell me about her sexual life with my dad, saying that « they had fun last night » or that « it was going well lately ». Always in a very aroused and flirty way. She rarely gave details, but sometimes did. My dad would grab her breast in front of me and she would look at me laughing. Also, my dad always said that I was « almost as pretty as my mother! », maybe once a week for my whole life. It never made me feel ugly, but again, looking back it’s just so wrong. If my partner said that to my child, i would be upset, and ask him to stop.

My mom would often question me about my relationships, leading the conversation around sex sometimes, or talk about her, and ask me if I was the same. When I was a teenager I realised I am asexual and when I told her, she did not listen to me. She was elsewhere. Overtime she kept asking me about those things, and i kept telling her I wasnt much into it, but she never really listened.

I was always more masculine than feminine, and both my parents always shamed me for it. I would tell my mom that my partners liked me the way I was, but she never believed it, saying they would prefer me as a girly girl.

The most recent thing that happened is a year ago. I was visiting my parents (I have to take a plane to get there). I was quite busy and I had plans to see friends, so I could not spend more time with my parents that day. I was in the living room with my mother when my dad got in the room, looking very sad and angry. He told us he was heading to the mall to have a coffee by himself. I was sad because I would have loved to go and have a coffee with him. When he left I started crying. I was very tired and I thought that the reason he left was maybe because he was mad at me. I told my mother and her answer was « oh no he is not mad at you, he is upset because I didn’t want to have sex with him last night. » That was so wierd… i ended up telling my mom that she shouldnt force herself and such… But i dont believe he left for that reason. She just used that for fucked up reasons..

Eniways.. I wont go throught the narc abuse in itself, because I would spend the night writing. But trust be, she checks every single box, on many different levels..

It stood out to me more than other brown dial models because of the richer more colourful red and gold accents. I was also more interested in brown sunburst rather than a matte ""tropic"" brown fauxtina dial because they rarely look convincingly aged. I also think patinas look better when they are real.

I got the sapphire crystal version and wanted to compare it to my WD1016 as they are a similar size but there are a few differences:

1. **The brushing direction on the lugs** \- WD1960S is linear, WD1016 is circular.
2. **The bezel** \- WD1960S is brushed, WD1016 is polished.
3. **The side of the case** \- WD1960S is brushed, WD1016 is polished.
4. **Drilled lugs** \- WD1960S has drilled lugs, WD1016 does not.

I really like the linear brushing on the WD1960S lugs and that it blends seamlessly with the bracelet endlink. On the WD1016 the circular brushing contrasts with the linear brushing on the endlink making the lugs reflect light differently. There are no quick-release springbars but they aren't necessary with drilled lugs.

The watch is beautiful, especially the dial. It's always interacting with the light, coming alive when it's sunny but most of the time it's unobtrusive looking. The dial is warm and cosy, the brown and gold colours make me think of coffee, the woods, autumn, bows and cavemen (especially with the arrow shaped hour hand). I can't help but think of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer when I look at it because of the red seconds hand 🤣. The brown dial also makes me think of the planet Mars while simultaneously the arrow shaped hour hand evokes Mars the Roman God of War.

The 3,6,9,12 dial layout feels right for the *Pioneer* like the four cardinal directions and with an arrow hand to point the way.

The legibility is good, the BGW9 is colour matched and the lume performs well. The screw pin bracelet was quick and easy to adjust using the supplied screwdriver.

I hope the WD1960S case is used for more dial designs in the future, well done Watchdives!

1ndw5vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/groomingvictim/comments/1ndw5vi/my_narc_mother_groomed_me_as_a_child/,My Narc mother groomed me as a child,"I (31F) have been going through a very intense year in which I discovered I am autistic and a child of a narcissistic mother. Recently I have been also realising that I may have been sexually abused by her as well.. no physical touch, but some very wierd memories keep going through my mind, and I needed to share.

I cannot go through all the details but my mother (clearly autistic too), always spoke very openly about sex in the house. She would tell me about sex from a very young age, and i remember she gave me a childrens book that was very graphic, showing penetration and other very implicit stuff. From memory, this book was very innapropriate for my age. I was around 5. One day I brought the book to my friends house, and their mom was FURIOUS. I was then told not to go to their house for a month. My mother was upset, and would vent it out to me, as if I could understand her.

She would walk around the house naked, take baths with the door open, and always talked to me in a very.. flirty way. I was asking questions about her pubic hair, and she was VERY open about it. Later in my life she would put on very light clothing that was see through, and we could clearly see her nipples. She would dress like that in front of my friends and family, and still does.

At around 10 years old I started having sexual relationships with guys that were 5 year older than me that lived across my house. They were way too old for me and I was made into doing wierd stuff. I was in love with one of them and my mother would often ask questions about our sexual life. I think she was trying to educate me about it in a way, but looking back she always seemed exited by it, and would kinda mock me.

Many years later, during a dinner with my current partner at my parents house, I was showing them pictures of old friends, now that they were adults. When i got to the guy I was in love with (the guy that was too old for me) she started saying that i « wanted to have sex with him when I was young!». I was uncomfortable and I told her, but she was laughing, and mocking me in front of my dad and partner.

Around the same age she offered me white panties for Christmas, saying in front of my whole family that they were for me to wear for my boyfriend. I repeat, I was around 10 year old. Nobidy said anything..

She would often tell me about her sexual life with my dad, saying that « they had fun last night » or that « it was going well lately ». Always in a very aroused and flirty way. She rarely gave details, but sometimes did. My dad would grab her breast in front of me and she would look at me laughing. Also, my dad always said that I was « almost as pretty as my mother! », maybe once a week for my whole life. It never made me feel ugly, but again, looking back it’s just so wrong. If my partner said that to my child, i would be upset, and ask him to stop.

My mom would often question me about my relationships, leading the conversation around sex sometimes, or talk about her, and ask me if I was the same. When I was a teenager I realised I am asexual and when I told her, she did not listen to me. She was elsewhere. Overtime she kept asking me about those things, and i kept telling her I wasnt much into it, but she never really listened.

I was always more masculine than feminine, and both my parents always shamed me for it. I would tell my mom that my partners liked me the way I was, but she never believed it, saying they would prefer me as a girly girl.

The most recent thing that happened is a year ago. I was visiting my parents (I have to take a plane to get there). I was quite busy and I had plans to see friends, so I could not spend more time with my parents that day. I was in the living room with my mother when my dad got in the room, looking very sad and angry. He told us he was heading to the mall to have a coffee by himself. I was sad because I would have loved to go and have a coffee with him. When he left I started crying. I was very tired and I thought that the reason he left was maybe because he was mad at me. I told my mother and her answer was « oh no he is not mad at you, he is upset because I didn’t want to have sex with him last night. » That was so wierd… i ended up telling my mom that she shouldnt force herself and such… But i dont believe he left for that reason. She just used that for fucked up reasons..

Eniways.. I wont go throught the narc abuse in itself, because I would spend the night writing. But trust be, she checks every single box, on many different levels..

I guess I just needed to share ..",1,1757554337.0,groomingvictim,0,0.67,False
1ndw5bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ndw5bq/aitah_for_refusing_to_do_my_wife_favours_i_didnt/,AITAH for refusing to do my wife favours I didn’t agree to?,"Well, my wife is clearly going through some growing pains (emotional). I don't blame her, adjusting to my new life approach will be difficult for her as I’ve begun to set some boundaries

My wife’s cousin has her stuff in our garage as she was moving places. I didn’t mind it as long as my wife didn’t make me responsible for stuff because she sometimes can volunteer me for things I don’t agree to. It’s her cousin, her responsibility.

Yesterday, I get home from what was the best day of work I've had in a long while. I told my wife about it during the day that it has been insanely busy the past several weeks and I wanted to spend some time playing with my daughter. More background: I rarely see my daughter during the week, since I leave before she wakes up and come home after she's already asleep. Yesterday I came home from work a little early so I could spend some time with her. My wife’s cousin (let’s call her Emily) starts to pack up when my wife walks in. I'm playing with my baby at this point, and Emily is gathering her things together to carry with her to her car, which was a few blocks away. My wife tells her she'll bring down a few bags and wait for her in the lobby of our building until she pulls the car around. Emily leaves, wife turns to me while I'm playing with baby, ""Well, baller, will you bring down those bags for Emily?"" ""No, I'm playing with Daughter before she goes to sleep.""

Now, in the past, if my wife asked me for anything, I would drop everything to do it.

""What do you mean you won't bring down the bags?""
""You told your cousin you'd bring them down. I'm playing with Daughter, who I haven't seen all day (shouldn't have explained myself). You can bring them down.""
""You're really not going to help.""
""I'm playing with Daughter. You can take them down as you agreed to."" ""I can't believe you. Emily asks for one little thing (she didn't ask, Wife did.), and you can't do it? After all that she does for us?"" (She sometimes babysits our daughter when my wife requests her to) ""Wife, if you continue speaking to me like this, you'll never get your way.""
""Fine."" Storms out of apartment to bring bags downstairs, something that took her all of 5 minutes.

Comes back up, while I'm changing our daughter, who has since created quite an explosion all over her clothes. ""I can't believe the level of disrespect you just showed my cousin (this never happened, only my wife’s ego was bruised here).”

You would never act like that if it was your family (I let out a slight chuckle). You would have run downstairs to help her without her even asking."" I have a ridiculous grin on my face for my daughter to keep her laughing while I'm changing her. I don't change my expression or demeanor at all. She continues spouting nonsense at a high audible level while my daughter is on the changing table and I'm trying to keep her calm.

""If you continue to speak to me like this, I have no reason to interact with you. I have better and more productive things to do.""

“You don't think of anyone but yourself. You should've volunteered to help her. I'm so hurt right now. Frankly, you should be embarrassed about how you just acted.""

At this, I can't help myself, and I let out a pretty hearty chuckle. Nothing too loud, just a, ""heh heh."" She then leaves the room, I finish changing our daughter and come out of Daughter's room. She tries to grab our daughter out of my hands. ""Excuse me?""

""I'm ready to feed her to put her to bed.""

""That's not how you ask.""

She says, ""can you please give me our daughter so that I can feed her and put her to bed?"" Before I have a chance to respond, she again grabs for our baby. At this point if I don't relent, it will turn into a safety hazard, so I give her our daughter. I hate, HATE that she got our daughter involved in this, and that she would put Daughter's safety in jeopardy just because of this. I'm so furious at this point I know that if I say or do anything else, I'll turn into the bad guy. As she starts feeding our daughter, I quietly and calmly put on my sweatshirt, grab my book, and head out the door. I then spend the next three hours out of the apartment with my phone off, reading at a coffee shop. When I get home, she's sleeping. I go about my business, get into bed, wake up before the crack of dawn, and head to the gym, then to work.

Next night, I came home after attending a work party and wife was in bed, and when I got into bed, she asked me how it was. ""It was awesome. [brief explanation of event].""
""Oh, I'm glad you had fun....(2 minutes pass)...I'm really sorry about how I acted last night.""
""Wife, I appreciate your apology, but again, I'm much more interested on what you're going to do in the future to avoid this sort of thing.""
""I'm going to try to ask you before I volunteer you for things (I hadn't even brought that up, she just came to that on her own).""
""Okay. What I'm more disappointed in, though, is the fact that you used our daughter as a prop in our fight.""
""What are you talking about?""
""You tried to grab her away from me, and created a dangerous situation.""
""I don't even remember doing that...""
""Well, you did, and it's simply unacceptable. I'm not going to tolerate that kind of behavior. No matter how angry or frustrated you get, it's never okay to resort to physical violence, especially when it includes our daughter.""
""You're absolutely right. I didn't even realize what I had done...."" ""Okay.""

Her: ""You know, you could take some responsibility for your actions as well.""
I just ignore that.

Next day, up before dawn, out to the gym. I come home from work after not speaking with her all day yet again, and she is all over me.

I'm a F and its my first time on the apps. I'd downloaded them very briefly a couple of years ago but I didn't take it seriously and I deleted after someone was not very nice to me. I'm still cool if I'm single but I decided to give the apps an honest shot anyway and took the plunge.

I do get that men tend to swipe right on anything and a connection doesn't mean interest (on both sides) but I've noticed that even once we get to the talking stage, most people will be talking fine and then when I suggest that we can get coffee and see if we vibe, they don't commit or they drop off. This makes no sense to me cos I have enough friends and I don't want to be texting back and forth for months. I'd rather just meet and see whether there's a connection and move on.

This makes me think that a whole bunch of people are on the apps just to kill time or stroke their egos. I'm not the most good looking person out there & I'm probably between 4-6 but tbh I swipe on people who I think are in a similar category also, not necessarily the most good looking profiles in the app and this still happens.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Orioles vs. Pirates: A Parlay of Perseverance and Porous Pitching**  
*By The Baseball Oracle of Laughter and Lineups*

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Baltimore Orioles (-150) are the clear favorites here, with implied probabilities hovering around 60% across books. The Pittsburgh Pirates (+400) are a long shot, hovering near 33% implied odds, which is about the same chance I have of explaining a baseball walk-off to a goldfish. The total runs line sits at 3.5, with the under priced at 1.51 (66% implied) and the over at 2.48 (40%). Given the Orioles’ pitching staff has allowed 12 HRs in their last 10 games and the Pirates’ offense is hitting .222, this feels like a game where the only thing going over 3.5 runs is the collective sigh of relief when the umpire calls “Time.”

**Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Skenes’ Superhuman Skills**  
The Pirates are on a four-game losing streak, which in baseball terms is about as sustainable as a diet of only cupcakes. Their pitching staff has allowed nine HRs in the last 10 games—imagine a pitcher’s nightmare where every pop fly turns into a moonshot. Paul Skenes, their 23-year-old ace, is a statistical deity (1.98 ERA, 10.1 K/9), but even he can’t out-pitch a team that’s hit more home runs in a week than they’ve had wins in a month.

The Orioles? They’re September magic incarnate. A 6-1 record in the division’s final stretch, including four one-run walk-off wins—yes, they’ve had more walk-offs than the average coffee shop has espresso shots. Their offense is led by Jackson Holliday (.368 BA) and Jeremiah Jackson (4 HRs), who’ve turned Camden Yards into a batting cage for the ages. Starter Tyler Wells isn’t a Cy Young contender, but his 3.60 ERA is better than the Pirates’ collective ERA (3.40) despite facing hitters who’d struggle to hit a balloon.

Clean, great-tasting water is one of the simplest upgrades you can make at home, and a good filter pitcher or dispenser offers an easy way to get there. They’re convenient, affordable, and require little effort to use. For many households, these countertop solutions are the most straightforward entry point into water filtration, helping reduce common contaminants and improve taste.

That said, pitchers and dispensers are not the only options. After years of looking into home filtration systems, we’ve found that under-sink and faucet-mounted filters generally perform better overall. They tend to last longer, filter more contaminants, and provide water more quickly, all while being surprisingly easy to install. Still, for those who want something simple with no plumbing involved, a pitcher or dispenser remains a practical choice.

It’s also worth keeping expectations realistic. Most home water filters, regardless of type, do not remove bacteria or other pathogens, so they won’t protect against waterborne illness during emergencies like boil-water advisories after natural disasters. For those scenarios, specialized portable and high-capacity systems are more reliable. But for day-to-day use, a well-chosen pitcher or dispenser can provide excellent drinking water for your household.

## 🏆 Best Overall Pitcher: [Brita Standard Everyday Pitcher](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#brita-standard-everyday-pitcher)

The Brita Standard Everyday Pitcher is one of the most recognizable water filter pitchers on the market, and for good reason. This 10-cup model, available with a SmartLight replacement indicator and an Elite filter included, strikes a strong balance of convenience and performance. Its design makes it easy to disassemble for cleaning, avoiding the buildup that can occur in pitchers with more complex construction. A thumb-flip cap allows for quick, one-handed refills at the sink, while the SmartLight tracks water usage to clearly signal when it is time for a filter change. The C-shaped handle is comfortable to hold and more user-friendly than other designs Brita has offered.

Although Brita sells similar models in stores, such as the Tahoe Water Pitcher, the Standard Everyday remains distinct for its straightforward design and comfortable grip. The Tahoe’s angular D-shaped handle, by contrast, is less intuitive and harder to manage, particularly when the pitcher is full. This makes the Standard Everyday the more practical option for everyday use in most households.

Despite being labeled as a 10-cup pitcher, the Standard Everyday can hold closer to 11.5 cups, making it well suited for small households that need a reliable daily supply of filtered water. At a little over 7 pounds when full, it is manageable for most users, though those looking for a lighter option may prefer Brita’s 6-cup Space Saver model. That smaller version is easier to lift at around 4.5 pounds when full, but it comes with a standard Brita filter rather than the Elite, requiring a separate purchase for those seeking higher performance.

Compatibility is also a strong point for this pitcher. Any Brita pitcher or dispenser that uses the company’s standard Pitcher and Dispenser Filter will also accept the Elite filter, offering flexibility and easy upgrades. The only exceptions are Brita’s Stream pitchers, which use a different filter system.

From a technical standpoint, the Elite filter performs consistently well across Brita’s lineup. Certification requirements vary slightly depending on whether the pitcher includes a performance indication device that measures water volume directly, but in either case, the filters are tested under far harsher conditions than typical tap water would ever present. This ensures that the Standard Everyday Pitcher delivers safe, clean, and great-tasting water in a package that is both practical and dependable.

## 💸 Best Budget Pitcher: [Waterdrop Water Filter Pitcher](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#waterdrop-water-filter-pitcher)

The Waterdrop 10-Cup Water Filter Pitcher delivers excellent value without compromising on performance. Its sleek, refrigerator-friendly design includes a clear exterior that lets you easily monitor the water level. Refilling is a breeze thanks to a hands-free lid that opens automatically when water hits it, and a smart LED indicator alerts you when it’s time for a filter change by shifting from blue to flashing red or solid red.

This pitcher comes with an NSF-certified filter (NSF/ANSI 42 and 372) that effectively reduces chlorine, odors, heavy metals, and harmful “forever chemicals” like PFAS. It noticeably improves taste, making everyday hydration, and even coffee, better. Its filter lasts up to 200 gallons or about three months, which is up to five times longer than many competing filters, helping reduce waste and save on replacement costs.

Waterdrop’s pitcher stands out for its efficient filtration and thoughtful design. With a fast flow rate, it fills quickly despite the multi-stage filter, and the transparent body makes it easy to see when it needs refilling. The LED light system adds a layer of convenience and clarity for maintenance. It strikes a strong balance between ease of use, effective performance, and sustainable design.

In short, the Waterdrop Water Filter Pitcher offers clean, better-tasting water with minimal fuss. It brings NSF-certified filtration, long-lasting filters, intelligent indicators, and a user-friendly form factor, all at an appealing price. This makes it a solid choice for those in search of the best budget-friendly pitcher filter that doesn’t skimp on quality.

## 🏆 Best Overall Dispenser: [Brita Ultramax Dispenser](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#brita-ultramax-dispenser)

The Brita Ultramax Dispenser is designed with large households in mind, offering an impressive 18-cup capacity in the main compartment along with an additional 10 cups in the upper refill reservoir. This dual-reservoir system ensures there is always filtered water ready while the top chamber continues to process new water. The size makes it an excellent fit for families or anyone who consumes a high volume of drinking water throughout the day. Its elongated, slim design also helps maximize refrigerator shelf space without crowding out other items.

One of the key advantages of this dispenser is its practicality. The spigot makes it easy for users of all ages to pour water, including young children who might find a heavy pitcher difficult to handle. The spigot is self-closing, which minimizes the chances of spills or drips. In addition, unlike a traditional pitcher, the dispenser allows you to fill a glass while the filter continues to work, ensuring a steady supply without interruption.

The Ultramax is available in a version that includes a SmartLight filter indicator and comes equipped with Brita’s Elite filter, providing efficient reduction of chlorine, lead, and other common contaminants. This filtration performance ensures the water is not only convenient to access but also clean and great tasting. For households seeking a reliable source of filtered water, the combination of capacity and performance makes this dispenser especially appealing.

The main tradeoff to consider is weight. When both the bottom compartment and top reservoir are full, the unit can weigh around 15 pounds, which may make it cumbersome to move when cleaning or refilling. Despite this, the Ultramax remains one of the most convenient solutions for keeping cold, filtered water easily accessible, particularly for families who want a simple, high-capacity alternative to smaller pitchers.

## 💎 Best Upgrade Dispenser: [LifeStraw Home Dispenser](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#lifestraw-home-dispenser)

Best known for its outdoor water filters, LifeStraw also makes excellent options for home use. While its pitchers are less ergonomic due to their tall and narrow design, the LifeStraw Home Dispenser stands out for its ease of use, large capacity, and straightforward operation. Much like Brita’s Ultramax, it is simple for children to use thanks to the spigot design, and it offers the added benefit of being certified to remove bacteria and parasites. This extra level of protection makes it a compelling choice for those who want broader filtration, though bottled water is still the safer option during a boil-water notice. The dispenser is also more resistant to clogging from sediment compared to many competitors, making it a strong upgrade for households that deal with water quality issues.

The filtration system in the LifeStraw Home Dispenser is notably robust. It holds ANSI/NSF certifications for the reduction of chlorine, lead, and mercury, and has been tested to a wide range of additional standards. These include NSF/ANSI Standard 401 for emerging contaminants, as well as cadmium, chromium (III), copper, glyphosate, and asbestos. Importantly, it is also tested for bacteria and parasites, a level of certification not often found in other home dispensers. Independent evaluations through IAPMO US and IAPMO India, both accredited organizations, add further credibility. The company also publishes its test results, which makes its claims transparent and trustworthy.

The system uses a two-stage filter. First, water passes through a hollow fiber membrane with 0.2-micron pores that physically block bacteria, parasites, and fine sediment. Afterward, it flows through an activated carbon and ion exchange filter, which captures metals, organic compounds, and other dissolved contaminants. The carbon filter is designed to last for 40 gallons or about two months, while the hollow fiber filter has a longer lifespan of 264 gallons or up to a year. Replacement filters can be purchased individually or on a subscription basis, ensuring that performance is easy to maintain over time.

The LifeStraw Home Dispenser offers a rare combination of convenience, capacity, and advanced filtration. It stands out not only for its ability to handle everyday water concerns such as chlorine and heavy metals but also for its resistance to clogging and effectiveness against bacteria and parasites. For anyone looking to upgrade from a standard dispenser, it delivers a higher level of protection and reliability without compromising ease of use.

---

Clean drinking water is one of those essentials that makes a noticeable difference in everyday life, and the right filter can help provide peace of mind as well as better taste. While the level of filtration varies by model, even basic pitchers and dispensers can reduce common contaminants and encourage healthier hydration habits at home. They also serve as a convenient, low-barrier way to bring filtration into households where more complex systems may not be practical.

At the same time, it is worth remembering that no single solution is perfect. Filters need regular replacement to stay effective, and each type has trade-offs in capacity, speed, or breadth of contaminant reduction. The best choice ultimately depends on your household size, water quality, and how much convenience matters to you.

Whichever option you choose, a pitcher or dispenser can make a lasting improvement to daily routines. They offer an affordable balance of simplicity, reliability, and improved taste, making it easier than ever to enjoy fresh, clean water straight from your own kitchen.",2,1757553789.0,productbible,0,1.0,False

Many posts in this sub has definitely taught me a lot about Cholesterol. I just got my test results and I am really happy. I hope this post serves as encouragement to others in this journey.


I am a vegetarian south asian(Indian) male have always had high LDL cholesterol. Dad also has high cholesterol and had a heart surgery at 52. 

- 2017 - Age 24 - LDL -> 131
- 2023 - LDL -> 134
- 2024 - LDL -> 161 (1 month travel and unhealthy food preceded this test)
- 2025 - LDL -> 94

All tests were done in the month of December except 2025

Changes I did in 2025

- Replaced carbs with quality protein.(Whey, beans, chickpeas)
- Reduced unhealthy snacks
- Incorporated healthy fats like Walnuts, Chia Seeds, Avacodo
- Cardio twice a week for 20-30 mins
- Started incorporating a little bit of salad every day


Changes in the 3 weeks after reading this sub
- Started 10 g of Psyllium husk 
- Replaced whole milk with fat free in my coffee. 2x a day
- Removed butter and replaced it with olive oil for my scrambled eggs
- Shifted from eating 10 eggs yolks to 5-6 egg yolks per week. 
- Reduced eating Indian cottage cheese ( Paneer). Replacing it with Tofu sometimes or just eating less quantity of it.
- Still had fried falafel, a slice of Pizza, small garlic bread and cheese once in a while but trying to keep saturated fats under 13-15 gm per day.


I personally feel the results are too good to be true. 
 
I will try to continue maintaining my diet and get it tested again in December. It will also give me a chance to see if I can maintain the diet that I have been doing for past 1 month. 

Some questions 
- Do you think the last 3 week changes had a big impact on the numbers?

Ever hit that midday slump and felt like you’re dragging your feet across the floor? 😩 You know the feeling—it's like your brain and body are just... done. Well, I’m here to let you in on a little secret that might just save your day—*and it's not your daily coffee fix.* 

Picture this: you're barely halfway through your day, your eyelids are heavy, and your motivation is hanging by a thread. Sound familiar? You’re not alone! We’ve all been there. But what if I told you a simple, 10-second ritual could reboot your energy levels like a jolt of espresso—without the jitters? 

**Here’s the deal:**

1. **Take a Deep Breath (or Five)**  
   - Sounds so simple, right? But trust me on this. Inhale deeply, hold for a moment, and exhale like you’re blowing out candles on a birthday cake. 🎂
   - Bonus points for imagining your stress flying away with those breathy puffs!

2. **Get Moving**  
   - Stand up! Stretch it out, do a little shimmy, or even shake your arms like you’re at a concert! 🎉 Just a few seconds of movement can get your blood pumping and brain buzzing.
   - Pro tip: Put on your favorite jam and let loose for 30 seconds. You’ll feel like a rockstar!

3. **Hydrate Like a Boss**  
   - Water, guys! It’s your best friend. When you’re feeling tanked, sip on some water. You might just be a bit dehydrated, and a quick splash of H2O could boost your clarity.
   - Try drinking half a glass while thinking about something that makes you smile. Instant mood lift!

4. **Visualize Your Best Self**  
   - Close your eyes for ten seconds and picture the most energized version of you. What are they doing? How do they feel? 🌟
   - It may sound woo-woo, but visualizing success can supercharge your motivation. Who wouldn’t want a little boost?

5. **Gratitude in a Snap**  
   - Think of one thing you’re grateful for right this second. Maybe it’s your comfy chair or your morning pastry. Whatever it is, it shifts your mindset from “Ugh, this day” to “Okay, I can do this!” 

**Why It Works:** 
- These tiny bursts of care for yourself can make a huge difference. They tap into your body’s natural rhythms, boost your mood, and help you break free from monotony. And when you feel good, you perform better. It's like having your own mini cheerleading session! 🙌 

And hey, who doesn’t need a little energy boost now and then? Life can feel like a marathon, and these quick rituals can be the hydration stations that keep you running strong.

Training and guidance? None. If you mess up, you get called out in front of everyone or even dragged in group chats.

Some people don’t even climb the ladder. They just leap. Imagine having a role lower than OM and suddenly becoming SOM. All because they’re close to senior leadership. Insane.

A lot of TLs are still tagged as “agents.” Their only way to earn extra is OT pay. And managers can edit that. Tell me that’s not fraud.

Payroll delays? Don’t worry, leadership has a trick. Instead of fixing it, they’ll throw client incentive money at you to shut you up—especially if DOLE gets mentioned. Meanwhile, site budgets cover their daily food and coffee runs. Employees scrape, bosses feast.

Confirmations take months. Retro pay never comes. And when it finally does, the money isn’t even from the company—it’s from the client.

Alorica sells the dream of fast growth. But the reality? Favoritism, fraud, and employees left undervalued and disrespected.

Anyone else in BPOs see this kind of setup?

But after 30 days of actually applying James Clear's methods from Atomic Habits, I'm a different person.

Here's what happened when I stopped reading about habits and started building them:

* I started stupidly small. Instead of ""I'm gonna work out for an hour every day,"" I committed to one push-up. That's it. Sounds dumb, right? But I actually did it. One turned to five. Then five turned to 10. I now do 20 pushups in a set when it's chest day.
* I made it impossible to fail. Put my workout clothes right next to my bed. Left a water bottle on my nightstand. Put a book on my pillow. When I woke up, healthy stuff was literally in my face. I also stopped buying junk food and soda's. No more fast food deliveries too.
* I piggybacked on stuff I already do. ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do my push-up."" ""After I pour coffee, I'll read one page."" I attached new habits to things I was already doing automatically. Same thing where I'll meditate after making my bed.

What happened week by week:

* Week 1: Doing my one push-up feeling like an idiot. But hey, I did it every day.
* Week 2: Started doing 5 push-ups because one felt too easy. Read 2-3 pages because one wasn't enough.
* Week 3: 15-20 push-ups felt normal. Reading for 10-15 minutes became automatic.
* Week 4: Full 30-minute workouts. Reading 30+ pages daily. It just happened. I realized this what compound growth means.

I stopped thinking of myself as lazy. I became ""someone who works out daily"" and ""someone who reads."" My brain literally rewired itself.

What I learned:

* Small and consistent beats big and sporadic every time. I'd rather do one push-up every day for a year than 100 push-ups once.
* Your environment matters more than your willpower. If you make good choices easier and bad choices harder, you'll naturally do better.
* Missing one day doesn't matter. Missing two days in a row starts a bad pattern.

Biggest mistake I made was tying to change everything at once. I focused on just two habits exercise and reading. That's it.

If you want to try this: just Pick ONE tiny habit. Make it so small it feels almost stupid. Do it for 30 days. Don't worry about results, just show up.

I went from zero exercise and zero books to working out daily and reading 2-3 books a month. Not because I became more disciplined, but because I made it easier.",76,1757552945.0,nonfictionbookclub,5,0.81,False

You and MY HUSBAND have made decisions based on yourselves and only yourselves. 
I feel very sorry for both of you but not nearly as sad as I feel for those who've been affected by your selfishness. Your children are an example of what you are.
Change things to the best of your abilities.
Pray for you everyday and I believe in prayer.

I'm curious. Do you guys have a routine with your beloved labrador?  
For example i have a night routine with my dog.  
  
At 6pm he gets his dinner together with us, then we'll have a coffee and our dog gets a small cookie, then we go for a walk. 

After our last walk for the day, i go upstairs and i livestream on twitch, and when i'm done, i always hear my dog going to the bathroom when i go down the stairs.  
And when i'm downstairs and go to the bathroom, he always waits for me to hop in the shower.  
  
i'll take my shower and our lab just naps and lays there like in the picture on the ground, and then after showering, we cuddle for 15 minutes on the couch before i head back upstairs to bed!",2,1757552266.0,labrador,0,1.0,False
1ndvg2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1ndvg2a/motorcycles_muscle_spasms_and_survival/,"Motorcycles, Muscle Spasms and Survival","Since this just happened to me today, I figured I'd offer some advice to anyone else who dreads a limb locking up while riding. For some context, I'm a 50 year old, one-year rider at this point(going to my ARC class this Saturday) and I prefer long-distance riding. I started on a 2012 Suzuki Boulevard C50T, and I now ride a 2025 Yamaha Tracer 9 with 5,500 miles on it, all me. I rode from Southern New Jersey, to Belleville NJ, about 95 miles for an Indian Demo Day at the Motorcycle Mall. I road three bikes, spent about two hours there, and was one third of the way coming back home, when my left leg suddenly locked up and started to seize. I was in 2nd gear thankfully, and I made it to a gas station to soothe my leg.

This is going to be in three parts: **Survival, Prevention,** and **Avoidance.** Survival gets you home safe, Prevention applies to what you do to yourself, and Avoidance applies to your riding habits.

**Survival**

**- Step 1:** Try **not** to Panic.  
Yeah, easier said than done. Riding a motorcycle is a constantly updating physics experiment: grip, balance, lean, location, speed, traffic conditions, road conditions...muscle spasms throw a lot of Chaos Theory into that experiment. And it **can** overwhelm you if you let it. Understand that just because **you** are having a muscle spasm, the **bike** isn't. It'll still follow your orders, even if you have to change how to give them. If you had a stable bike before the spasm, you most likely still have one. Breathe, try and slow down your mind and heart, and keep rational.

**- Step 2:** Put on your hazards as quickly as possible.  
You have an emergency, even if it's just you looking silly. But to other drivers, they don't know what's going on. Imagine a cager having a muscle spasm and you see it through their window....what are you seeing? Someone looking like a complete nutjob behind the wheel: making faces, ignoring the road, rubbing or whacking themselves frantically. Even on a motorcycle, you still look bug-nutty. Your hazards tell everyone: *""This is serious! I am having problems, stay back!""*

**- Step 3:** Look for a place to get out of the flow of traffic. Get there if you can safely...but come to a complete stop if you absolutely must.  
This goes best to worst case scenario, then everything in between:  
**Best Case:** The spasm is minor, controllable, and you have a clear line to a parking lot or an off-ramp somewhere close by. Gauge how impaired you are, and re-route your controls to safely exit the roadway. In my case, I couldn't shift for example. So I stayed in 2nd, signaled my way over, got into a gas-station lot, and was able to barely get off my bike.  
**Worst Case:** The spasm is not one, but **several** muscles. The pain is causing you to lose focus on the road and traffic(this was my level of pain: left calf, inside left thigh, and the back of my left hip, all wanted to lock up.). And you're on a single lane road with no shoulder. Gently use your brakes to bring the bike to a stop. If you can't pull in the clutch, you'll have to carefully rev-match down to 2nd or 1st, and then try and squeak into neutral so the bike doesn't lurch you off when you stop. If you can't use the throttle, downshift into 1st or 2nd, feather your clutch and stay in the friction zone so you can move right to where you want to be. If one brake isn't available, use the other. It **will** feel weird, but your goal is surviving the spasm.  
**Everything Inbetween:** You need to apply your judgement here. Above all, control is your priority. It doesn't matter how near or far safety is, if you can't get yourself and your bike there in a controlled state. Take the **safest** course, not the shortest. Cutting people off or jamming on brakes doesn't help your situation, and makes theirs much worse. Most people aren't jerks. Work with traffic, and *usually,* it'll work with you.

Get over, but get over to a SAFE position to get off. Don't perch your bike right on the edge of a no-shoulder ditch, because you want to avoid other cars. Conversely, avoid just stopping in the middle of the road ***if you can help it.*** If it's that bad and you have no choice, stop where you are, but try and get out of the way as quickly as possible if there's traffic around you. With your hazards on, people will probably back off, or give you a hand.

**- Step 4:** Do not just sit and wait for the spasms to stop - move the muscles to break up the spasm.  
This is hard enough with only **one** muscle. My calf wanted no weight, my inside thigh wanted my right leg elevated, and my hip wanted me bent over. There are video games with that kind of body positioning as a boss-level move. But you need to restore blood flow and get the muscles moving to beat the spasm. If it's your arms, try pushing off a wall or the ground. Legs? Walk around. Again, be careful. It's easy to over-exert a seizing muscle and **tear** it a bit...trust me, you'll think you were asleep before.

And...accept it's going to hurt. Young folks might only get a light limp or an ""ooh oh, ahh ahh"" pain that lasts a few minutes....I was considering vomiting just from the pain. I've had pins drilled into my ankle, I've had a spiral fracture up my tibia, and I've put my forehead through a windshield in an auto-accident. Nothing compared with the blistering pain of three muscles fighting to make me a modern-art figure, while I'm trying not to look like I need emergency medical assistance...and I tell you now: had some passerby asked me if I needed help, I would have enthusiastically said **YES!!!** It's going to hurt, but you need to get through the hurt to the healing.

**Step 5:** Don't immediately jump back on the bike. Give yourself time to recover.  
The fastest way to get right back to Step 1, is to think the spasms gone, you jump onto your bike and gun it for home. You don't just want to feel the spasm is gone. You want to feel that you are back in control of your body. Take some time, sit and relax if you can, walk around if you can't. You've just had a confidence shattering event...rebuild that confidence before you twist the throttle again.

Once you're out of the danger zone, take some time to think through your next steps, which leads us neatly to...

**Prevention**  
This isn't step by step, because no two people are exactly the same, riding the exact same bike with the exact same issues. But it is little things you can do both before or after a spasm, to reduce the risk of one.

**- Stop, Rest and Refresh**  
Yeah, you just stopped and rested to get rid of the spasm. Your body feels fine, so you can make it the rest of the way. Or maybe you felt one coming on, got off the bike and worked the muscles free again. Why stop a 2nd time?

Because it's safer than **surviving** a spasm. Maybe it's a long ride, a new bike or mod, or maybe it's just you. Stop somewhere, get some time out of the seat, and decompress. Evaulate what caused it, and if you can stop it from happening again. Maybe those new pegs need to be dropped down. Maybe you need to squeeze the tank harder with your legs, to take the load off your arms. But none of that's gonna happen if you just rip back up to speed, and a spasm could still be in your future.

**- Drink Water. Not Soda, Coffee, or Energy Drinks: WATER**  
Barring not exercising, spasms are most often caused by dehydration. The simplest solution, is to drink plain water. Drink it before your ride, get a camelback pack or throw a bladder and tube or just some bottles into a backpack. Drink water, and your body will be less likely to lock up on longer riders. Avoid sodas, coffee, tea, energy drinks and especially salty snacks like chips, fries or pretzels. If you get a spasm, drink water, and give your body a few minutes to get it distributed through you.

**- Carry an analgesic cream and OTC ibuprofen on a ride if possible.**  
These can literally save you after a bad spasm. Ben-Gay, Icy-Hot, some Advil or Alleve, are all designed to KO a spasm cold. Keep them them in a pocket on your backpack or in a plastic bag in your tank bag or panniers, A good addition, is a small spray-bottle of 91%-95% Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Analgesics work best when applied directly to the skin of the affected area. Head to a bathroom, spray down your skin with the rubbing alcohol, clean with a paper towel, and you'll wipe dead skin, dirt and sweat out of the way, adding effect and speed.

For the pills, add in a granola bar of your choice. You want something that is going to be digested well, won't spike your sugar or salt levels, and will act as a base for the ibuprofen(they usually say you should eat something first anyways.) You don't need a big meal, just have something you can gnosh down quick so you're not at the mercy of whatever lies in a convenience store warmer.

Just make sure to always bring them in with you when you're done riding for the day. Both the creams and the pills are meant to be in a nice, dry, temperature-controlled bathroom cabinet or closet. In a bag on your bike that can go from 2 degrees to 102, you're going to damage both the pills and the creams. If you're lucky, they just work a bit less...when you need them most.

But all of that is countering or evading the trap of a spasm. The best defense is avoiding the trap before it even springs. Which goes to...

**Avoidance**

**- Know Yourself**  
Maybe you're a 30 year biker that started on Sport Bikes and now rides a cushy Goldwing for hours on end. Maybe you're a Day one rider, that's still trying to decide between a Naked Bike, a Cruiser, or a Street Missile. But knowing yourself, your limits and your habits will give you the awareness to spot spasms before they come on.

You'll generally get a few warning signs before you hit spasm territory. You'll feel a dire need to stretch, or you'll keep feeling a muscle stay stiff even after you relax it, or you want to flex the muscle repeatedly because it's bugging you. These are the sirens warning you that your body's getting worn down, and you need time out of the seat. An Iron Butt or Saddlesore award isn't worth the risk to your life and those around you. **Nothing is worth fighting through a spasm.** Get out of the seat and give your body time to recover.

**- Know your Bike**  
For new riders, or new owners of a bike, this one's tricky. Especially if you're going from one style to the next. Sport Bikes rev higher than Cruisers/Baggers/Tourers. ADV bikes are often top-heavy compared to Nakeds. Every bike is going to hit you in different ways.  Does the seat turn a nerve tickle into a compliance hold after an hour? Do you have to slightly dislocate your foot to shift or rear-brake? Are you hunched forward on the handlebars? Know how **your** bike hits **your** body. Those are the only two you'll have one of(multi-bike owners, you know what I mean :-) )

**- Know your Ride**  
Group rides or solo, it's deceptively easy to ignore what the ride itself is doing to your body. An hour on the highway atop a sport bike, is an hour in a fairly tucked jockey-style posture. On a Bagger/Tourer, it's an hour of your butt taking every bump and dip in the road. Street driving's just as bad, replacing prolonged positions, with repetitive movement strain. On my way up to Belleville, I stopped at a service center for a quick lunch, and was taken aback by how much my right knee hurt when I started moving it. I'd been riding for a little over an hour at that point, split fairly evenly between street and highway, But once I swung my leg over, I though I had a rock or something hit me. Once I started walking, I was fine. But I had ignored it probably right up to the danger zone myself.

Try to plan little stops on long rides. If you can't find a service center or rest stop, go sightseeing. Find a historic area, hop off for 20 minutes or so, and just look around. Find a mall or a restaurant you want to go to, and chill.

**Epilogue**

There's going to be a thousand and one little moments of terror on a motorcycle. We're not(well, **most of us are not)** daredevils, out to chase an adrenaline high. Spasms can be some of the worst. But if you manage them well, deal with them when they come, and keep your head, there's never going to be a spasm that stops you from riding by CHOICE. I hope that this little offering helps someone deal with a moment like this, and they grow stronger from the surprise. Riding has its ups and downs. Keep your head up and aware, and you'll have a lot fewer downs.",0,1757552244.0,motorcycles,4,0.5,False

9/10/25

If there is anything nefarious to know about the history of this building, it has not been left in plain sight. Here is what I know so far: The university was founded in 1878, and for a while, the library was a single room in one of the academic buildings. The library building I work in now wasn’t built until 1908, when an anonymous alumnus made a generous donation. I tried to find out who the man was by cross-referencing the name of the library against last names of notable members of the community from that time, to no avail.

After failing to find anything else of interest in university reports, I dove into local news from 1907-on. Even just browsing these old articles is time consuming and monotonous. None of it is digitized, so I had to break out our dusty collection of microfilm. For those of you who might be unfamiliar, these are reels of film, sort of like the ones you see on old movie projectors. Each frame contains one page of a document. I have to flip through them slowly on our microfiche machine, looking for key words or images since I’m not even sure what exactly I’m looking for. I was only midway through 1908 when someone rang the bell on the counter of the circulation desk, signaling for my attention.

“Hi, can I help you?”

The girl was dressed in sweats with her hair in a messy bun, MacBook secured under her arm. “Yeah, um, I just thought I should let you know, the printer downstairs is doing something weird.”

“Something weird?” I inquired as I moved around the desk, prepared to help her fix a jam or replace the ink cartridge.

“Yeah… you should probably just go see for yourself.”

She followed me to the ground floor into the computer lab, where the printer was still spitting out pages. There was a pile of paper on the ground where the catch tray must’ve overflowed. I turned to look at the girl. “How big was your print job!?”

She shook her head, “just five pages. But they didn’t come out right, look.” She pulled the papers out from where she’d sandwiched them in her laptop and handed them over. It was an essay titled, *Modern Applications of A.I.*, but across every page was a sort of watermark made up of connecting lines, like a maze.

I tried to flip the off switch on the printer, but it didn’t respond. Maybe it wouldn’t shut down until its current print job was complete. Picking up some of the papers on the floor, avoiding the pages that were continuously spilling out of the catch tray, I noticed they also had the maze watermark, but that wasn’t all. Each page looked like PDFs of a photocopied book, with the telltale spine indentation down the middle of two open pages. I recognized the title printed in small font at the top of every other page.

“You didn’t also attempt to print the entirety of Sun Tzu’s *The Art of War*, did you?”

Eyes wide, the girl responded, “definitely not.”

“Alright, I’m sorry for the inconvenience here, but I’m clearly going to have to call Tech Services. Do you think you can use the printer in the student center instead?” I asked, tucking her botched print job in with the pile I was picking up off the floor. She agreed, seeming relieved to walk away from the issue without having been blamed for it. 

It crossed my mind that it could’ve been a prank. Some tech-savvy student arguably could’ve hacked into our system settings and added the watermark to every foreseeable print job. But suspecting that the incident was more inline with the other occurrences that have been happening lately, I decided to investigate myself before calling for backup. When I printed a test page from one of the lab computers, it came out completely normal.

I collected the watermarked *Art of War* print outs and made my way back upstairs. Instead of throwing them right in the recycling, I was compelled to put the pages in order. The maze-like symbol scratched at the back of my mind. I thought of Daedalus’ Labyrinth from Greek myth. Daedalus built the huge maze on commission for King Minos to contain the Minotaur. His creation was so successfully confusing that he could not find his own way out upon its completion. The watermark also kind of resembled the folding ridges of a brain. These were stray thoughts I mentally filed away for later.

And why *The Art of War*? I can’t say it’s ever been on my reading list. A brief google summary told me it covers topics such as when to fight and when not to, how to mislead the enemy, and the importance of knowing oneself as well as the enemy. I’m not sure what to make of that. Am I the enemy? I’m not sure what I could’ve done to get on a library ghost’s shit-list, other than occasionally vaping in the bathroom.

I went back to the microfilm. Two hours of scrolling through reels didn’t turn up anything helpful and my eyes were starting to blur, so I decided to pack it in for the night. As I was winding the tape back onto the reel though, I noticed a spot where the film had been doctored. I hadn’t noticed it before. It must’ve only been a small section of the paper from one day in April, 1908, but someone had removed it. I might be grasping at straws, but on the chance this is a lead, I decided to request the same film real, but from a different library, through a resource sharing program the university offered. It was available at a library in the next town over, so I would just have to wait a few days for them to ship it here.

…

I’m home now, but writing again while the details of the last hour are fresh in my mind. I didn’t dare stay in the library long past 3:00AM, but on a whim, I decided to sit in my car for a while in the parking lot. My trunk is still full of board games and things that I used to entertain kids at my last job. I would say I never had time to clean it out, but the truth is I’m just kind of lazy about things like that. Amongst the pile of coloring books and stray battleship pegs was a pair of binoculars. I had picked them up from a thrift store as an excuse to go outside with a client whose home was infested with rats. But that’s a whole other story. The point is, I had binoculars. They were old and the lenses were scratched, but they did allow me to see into the library windows.

The ground floor is essentially a basement, and therefore has no windows. But if anything strange happened on the first or second floors, I hoped to catch it. I cracked my windows to maybe hear any noises coming from inside as well. I know it might seem stupid that I didn’t just go home and mind my business. At this point though, I’ve gotten invested in the mystery. All the potential clues I uncovered today got my research motor going, and the thought of uncovering something more was too tempting.

Nothing happened for a while. I scrolled on my phone a bit, regularly glancing up for signs of movement through the windows. I cringed when I checked Facebook and saw a post from a girl I went to high school with. She’d written, “3:33, make a wish… I wish that Derek would pay his f\*cking child support”. People are so messy online.

That’s when the first noise came. It was muffled, and to someone just walking by they might not think much of it. I recognized it though. It was the same length and pitch as the bang I heard that first night in gov-docs. I put my phone down, binoculars back in hand.

Now, I couldn’t see that far into the building because I always turn the lights out before I leave. But there are a few emergency lights that always stay on, and those provide a little illumination. A few moments later, there was another sound like groaning metal, again muffled by the distance. I’m not exactly sure, but I think I saw the long metal rows of bookshelves shift. Where before they were lined up in neat rows with enough spacing to pass a fire inspection, now they connected together in some places, or angled off in others.

I stared in disbelief. The sheer weight of one shelf, books included, had to be around half a ton, maybe more. There was no logical explanation for the ease at which I’d seen them move. It did not occur to me at the time to try and photograph it with my phone, but even the thought of doing so now feels sacrilegious somehow.

The next bit of movement shocked me out of my frozen state. I held up the binoculars, trying to focus on whatever it was. A figure streaked across the top floor. A moment later it appeared down on the first floor, less quickly this time. It was a man in a black jacket. He was stumbling a little and it was hard for me to make out much detail. He paused for a minute, placing his hand against the window as he caught his breath. Then he startled, looked back, and started running again, leaving behind a bloody handprint on the glass. If something had been chasing him, it must’ve taken another direction because I never saw it.

Despite my previous resolution not to call Campus Police again, I had to now, right? Even disregarding the thing with the shelves moving, I had definitely seen a man in the building and he was bleeding. With a bad feeling in my gut, I dialed the number.

“Hello, campus police.” The same woman from before answered.

“Hi, this is Mary from the Library. I just saw a man-”, but she cut me off.

“Hold on one second.” I took a breath, worried she was going to hang up. Instead, a man picked up, “Hello Mary, this is Chief Jackson. Are you currently inside the Library?”

“I- no, I’m sitting in my car outside, but I saw-” He cut me off again.

“Okay, that’s good. Now I want you to listen to me very clearly, Mary. Turn on your car and drive home. Can you do that for me?”

“Sir, can you just listen for a second?”

“Mary, you need to forget about whatever you saw. Turn on your car, and drive home.”

“But…”

“I will personally inspect the building tomorrow morning. By then, this will all feel like a strange dream. Now, go home Mary. Just trust me.” I opened my mouth to argue, but he hung up.

I’m home now, and I’m afraid to fall asleep. The officer said it would feel like a dream in the morning. What if that means I’ll forget what happened? I’m going to make some coffee.",2,1757552197.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
