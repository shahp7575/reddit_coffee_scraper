Make sure you hold the door for her...oh and don't forget to pull out her chair. 

Make sure you walk on the curb side of the side walk.

It's also a good idea to offer her your jacket if it's cold.

And make sure to give her a genuine compliment.

-----‐-------------------------------------------------------------

A fool proof way to guarantee you get ghosted.

What is wrong with being a good guy? 

If she doesnt appreciate me then maybe she wasn't one in the first place.

Surely there has to be an exception. The good ones appreciate a nice guy.

What about introverted girls?

Look guys I understand that this seem backwards. 

I've been there myself many times. Following all the conventional wisdom.

Only to be ghosted after the first or second date. 

I thought I was being a good guy? This is how I was raised. I will always be this way.

We've all heard that girls like bad boys. Ones that don't care about them...

...but what does that really mean?

Let's break it down.

When you hold a door for a girl what you're actually doing is you're giving her your masculinity.

Well what's wrong with that?

Every nice guy is offering up his masculinity.  

And she thinks to herself ""well this guy really likes me...he's not as sexy I thought""

Why is it that when a girl knows he likes her that she no longer likes him.

It's because now you've put her on a pedestal.

You've put her above you and now she looks down on you.

You're working so hard to please her and all she sees is another desperate lonely guy.

Not the sexy bad boy that she desires. The guy who all the girls are after. 

The one who doesn't care if she has to open the door herself. 

The guy who only gives his masculinity to a girl who has earned it.

She expects you to do these things but when you don't it tells her ""I don't care if this goes anywhere""

This registers in her brain and she thinks ""wow he isn't like all the other guys. Does he always get away with this?"" 

Now she thinks you must be getting some because you are not needy or desperate.

You aren't trying to impress her and now she can relax. The pressure has been removed.

Now it feels like a casual meet up with a friend. 

She can actually get to know you without worrying. 

You see this is exactly how she wants a first date to be. 

Meet up for coffee, go for a walk, have a couple of drinks.

You keep it light hearted and flirty and in 30 minutes you tell her you have to go and...

...POOF you're gone. 

The date was successful. She had a good time and now she craves more.

You get a text in only a few minutes saying how much fun she had. 

When you take the pressure off of the date and hold back your masculinity now she know that you ""get it"" 

You've just separated your self from the nice boys and now you're the not so bad Bad Boy that she desires.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hle4gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hle4gl/5_marketing_hacks_for_tight_budgets/,5 Marketing Hacks for Tight Budgets,"Creating a buzz for small businesses can be an exhilarating adventure, akin to a tightrope walk over a pit of friendly lions—terrifying yet thrilling! Here are some creative marketing ideas that can light up your endeavor and make waves in your community.

1. **Social Media Storytelling**: Dive into the realm of storytelling on platforms like Instagram or Facebook! Share bite-sized anecdotes that illustrate your brand’s journey—think of it as a peek behind the curtain. Invite your audience into a “day in the life” at your business or spotlight the quirky encounters that happen at your storefront. Remember, people connect with stories more than statistics. Use humor where appropriate (maybe that time you attempted a DIY project that ended up as a Pinterest fail) to humanize your brand. 

2. **Email Campaigns with Heart**: Rather than sending out an ordinary newsletter, why not create an ongoing series? Think of it like a serialized sitcom, where each email leaves them wanting more. You can include juicy behind-the-scenes content, industry insights, or even a “customer spotlight” segment that celebrates your patrons and invites them to share their experiences with your products. Sprinkle in some humor, keep the tone informal, and maybe even throw in a quirky gif or two. It'll feel like a letter from an old friend rather than a sales pitch!

3. **Community Events with a Twist**: Organize events that draw in the community and make them memorable. A ""Business-Neighbors Night"" could include local artists, food trucks, and live music—all showcasing the neighborhood spirit. Think of it like a block party meets farmer's market. Encourage participants to share their experiences online with a dedicated hashtag, creating a ripple effect on social media. Add in some fun contests—perhaps a “best homemade salsa” competition? This not only promotes community but also fortifies those local connections.

4. **Collaborate with Local Influencers**: Stop for a minute and think—who in your community has a voice? Partnering with local influencers can give your business the exposure it needs. These connections can be organic and authentic—like a friend introducing you to their lively crew. Invite them to your shop, let them experience your products, and encourage them to share their honest feedback online.

5. **Interactive Challenges**: Host online challenges that engage your audience while promoting your products. For example, if you run a local café, launch a “30-Day Coffee Challenge” where customers try different coffee styles and post photos using a special hashtag. This builds community around your brand and encourages repeat visits.

6. **Customer-Generated Content**: People love to see themselves as part of the story. Create a campaign where customers can submit photos of themselves using your products in unexpected settings. Maybe a photo of your cozy café cup on a mountaintop? Not only does this generate authentic content, it creates an engaging way for customers to feel invested in your brand story.

7. **Pop-up Events with Local Flare**: Host pop-up shops or booths at popular local events or markets. This provides exposure and taps into the community vibe. Collaborate with local artisans or businesses for a unique experience. It’s like throwing a spontaneous party where everyone walks away with a smile and hopefully, some of your products!

8. **Themed Givebacks**: Infuse philanthropy into your marketing. For every purchase made during a month, consider donating a portion to a local charity. Create themed days—like “Taco Tuesdays,” where customers can enjoy a special deal while knowing they’re contributing to a good cause. This gives them a reason to feel connected and a part of something larger.

9. **Gratitude Rewards**: Launch a loyalty program that not only rewards purchases but also highlights acts of kindness within your community. For instance, give points for referrals or for supporting local charities. This way, you not only build a loyal customer base but also create a culture of gratitude and engagement.

10. **Reflect and Invite**: Finally, always invite your community into your brand’s journey. Use rhetorical questions in your digital communication that prompt them to reflect on their own experiences—“What does community mean to you?” It’s like tossing a pebble into a pond and watching the ripples expand!

The key here is to cultivate a lively relationship with your audience. When you bring them into your story and they see themselves reflected in your journey, you've not only won their hearts, but they’ll likely take your message and share it far and wide! So, go out there and spread that good energy. You never know what amazing connections you might make!",1,1735048867.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False
1hle49x,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1hle49x/how_is_this_biphobic/,How is this biphobic?,"\[PLEASE don't call this biphobic. I'm asking genuine questions here.\]



Sorry to intrude in here but I (22F) am gay and have recently seen the tension (not sexual unfortunately) rise between lesbians and bisexual women. I personally have no problem being with a bisexual woman but it seems like the term ""biphobic"" is being thrown around like ones at a strip club, which is harmful because it makes actual biphobia get overlooked. I've even seen some bi women call out other bi women for constantly calling everything biphobic just because she didn't get her way.

  
But anyways, I've heard it was biphobic to not want to date someone just because they are bi, which I get, but I think this goes deeper than that. Personally, it seems pointless to try to date a bi woman as a woman if she has a strong preference for men. Bi women make fun of lesbians all the time for trying to get with straight women but somehow it's biphobic to not want to date a woman with a nearly 99% preference for men. At that point, what would be the difference? Like asking out women with a 100% preference for men is laughable but it's ok if the percentage is 90%? Where is the line drawn? And honestly, if your preference for men is that high, why even get upset if women don't want to date you? It seems like some get upset that women they don't even like don't like them. It reminds me of when the straight girl finds out you're gay and gets upset that you don't have a crush on her despite having no interest in you whatsoever.

  
I saw people try to use analogies like ""just because I'm drinking coffee (dating a man) now doesn't mean I don't like tea (dating women) too."" And sure but if you like coffee MORE than tea, what are the chances that you only drink tea for the rest of your life and never drink coffee again? Why would someone offer you tea if all you talk about is how much you like coffee? If you like coffee more, what are you more likely to look for in the store, tea or coffee? If you like coffee more, what are you more likely to enjoy, a cup of tea or a cup of coffee? And why do you keep bringing your tea hating coffee to the tea parties?

  
Again, not trying to sound biphobic and I'm sorry if i do, but trying to date a bi woman with a preference for men as a woman just reminds me of trying to get with a straight woman who has a few ""exceptions"" here and there. It doesn't matter what happens if her end goal is to be with a man (something many bi women will literally say to lesbians faces while in relationships with them). Unless it's exclusively a sex only relationship, committing here feels like a waste of time. And honestly, I feel kind of disrespected because it seems like I'm expected to be some lonely loser because I'm gay and am supposed to be desperate for any bi woman's attention. It feels like a sense of entitlement but if i say anything about how i feel, i get blasted with, ""BIPHOBIC!""

  
I know not every bi woman is like this, but you have to also think about what it's like from my perspective. Not every bi woman is like this but every woman like this is calling herself bi. But even if i ask appropriate questions, secretly trying to weed them out, it's still ""biphobic."" Thoughts?",0,1735048854.0,bisexual,1,0.25,False

Maybe it's because I only had coffee for breakfast. The hang out went decently but I couldn't help get that tight feeling away.

I recently joined r/loseit and noticed that many people posting on here seem to be struggling with losing weight and the best way to do so. So I thought I would share my own experience with weight loss and how I went from 215lbs down to 150lbs. Hopefully anyone reading this can hopefully take something positive from it to help them on their weight loss journey.

If your only goal is weight loss and you are not concerned about losing any muscle then this is a good plan to follow.

**Calories**

The first thing you should do when looking to lose weight is figure out what your kcal daily requirements are. Eat less than this and you will lose weight. Click the link to check how many calories you need per day. 

https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html

Find out what your daily maintenance calories are, minus 500 calories from that number so for most people it would be roughly 2000 calories a day. 2000 minus 500 is of course 1500. Doing this should make you lose a pound of fat each week. This is just an example however. Enter your own information to get an accurate number for yourself. Add in cardio which eventually should get to a point when you are burning around 3500 calories a week through cardio alone. 6 cardio sessions a week. Sounds pretty extreme but it’s around 600 calories per cardio session. It’s not that extreme a number. It’s just about building up your fitness to be able to do it consistently over a prolong period of time. That’s 2 pounds of weight loss a week. A pound through your diet and another pound through cardio.

**Diet**

I would recommend a 90/10 split for your diet. As in 90% of your daily diet should be clean calories and around 10% can be junk food. I feel this is the best approach, especially those who struggle with eating clean. The majority of your calories should come from fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Some dairy is ok. What fruit and veg you decide is up to you. Just go for the lowest calorie options generally. Some fruits can be quite high in calories. Watch out for those. Calories in vs calories out is the most important thing. It’s very important you cut out processed food out your diet. Whole grain rice and whole grain pasta are good weight loss options. Sweet potatoes as well. They are high in fibre which helps curb hunger. Don’t skip on the vegetables. At least around 25% of your calories should come from vegetables alone. Get a decent amount of protein as well. Recommended amount for most adults I believe is around 50-60 grams a day. Aim for that.

**Intermittent Fasting**

First thing in the morning have only black coffee. Have a few cups if you like. You will need the caffeine for your cardio sessions. It basically has no calories. Do your cardio. After your cardio I recommend decaf coffee. It helps curb your appetite. I also recommend intermittent fasting. 16/8. 16 hour fast. 8 hours eating period. It might sound difficult but it’s really not. Your body will adapt. I can now go around 8-10 hours after waking up before I start feeling hungry. Start the fast after your last meal at night. Go sleep. By the time you wake up it should be around 8-9 hours already passed by. Have your coffee then cardio in the gym. By then you should probably have another few hours to go. Just drink lots of water and have some coffee/decaf coffee. Basically any low calorie drink. Even diet soda since it has no calories. The weight will begin flying off.

**Cardio**

I already touched on cardio earlier but will go into more detail now. Cardio is really important for weight loss. If your only goal is weight loss and not concerned about losing muscle then just stick to cardio. Lifting weights isn’t necessary. Build up your fitness levels. Start off with long slower cardio sessions eventually it should get to a point when it’s a mixture of liss and hiit cardio as each type of cardio offers different benefits. After each cardio session your shirt should be drenched in sweat once your fitness levels allow it. Aim to
burn at least around 500-600 calories per cardio session. 5-6 days a week. Challenge yourself with each cardio session. Don’t slack off. Listen to your body however. If you feel you need a break take it. Don’t risk overtraining.

Hopefully there is enough information here to get you started or increase your knowledge of weight loss and given you new ideas. The point I was trying to make here is that weight loss is super simple. Its really about finding the motivation to stick to a diet/training plan long term because it can be difficult. It’s why I recommend a 90/10 diet. You can still have a daily treat. Just in moderation. Why most diets fail is because people don’t enjoy them. Finding a healthy low calorie diet you actually look forward to is the secret to weight loss success. In a months time of following this advice you should definitely start noticing a difference in your body.

EDIT - I wanted to add that I have had some comments with people asking me how I only managed to lose 65lbs in a year if I was losing around 2lbs a week. Wanted to share what happened over the last year in regards to my weight loss. My diet/training started last year in July. So from July 2023 to the end of November I was consistently losing 2lbs a week. Then I ended up relaxing with my diet and training in December for the holidays. Same with my cardio. It wasn’t until late January until I started back up with cardio and my diet. So I essentially lost two months of progress there. My weight also went from 160lbs to 170lbs in my break. 

So from July 2023 to the end of November I went from 215lbs to 160lbs. 55lbs weight loss in 5 months. So from beginning of February to end of April I got down to about 150lbs. Ended up getting a bad flu in May this year and was out the gym for a month. Not dieting or training for a month. Ended up putting on some weight and went back up to 160lbs. Went back in the gym in June and by end of July got back down to 150lbs and maintained that weight since then. 

So as you can see from July 2023 to July 2024 I was actually only training and dieting for around 9 months out of the year. 3 months was no training or dieting. If it wasn’t for my 2 breaks I would of reached 150lbs weight goal at least a couple of months before I eventually did. Hopefully that clears up any confusion as to why I only lost 65lbs in a year. When you have that much weight to lose, chances are these hiccups will happen. Holiday season, illness or any other reason that could affect your fitness goals. Try not to let it be too long of a break.

I am looking to get down to 140lbs. Will start my training again after Xmas. 

Any questions please ask🙂

The store was crowded and the whole thing was stressful due to having to make substitutions and then the customer getting mixed up over delivery time and not being home to sign for alcohol. I was hustling and sweating in the 50-60 degree weather when I arrived at their apartment.

By the time I got home I had a stress headache and throat congestion / flem, which turned into a little bit of a sore throat and fever (and tiny bit of runny nose, though never had to blow it). Sometimes this happens with me and I usually fight it off (rarely if ever get sick). Because of this I decided to press on and work 5 tough hours yesterday. At some points in the day, I was a little tired and had to lay down for a bit, and when it felt like a little bit of a fever was coming on I took some advil and it went away.

Last night I woke up in the middle of the night drenched and this morning I woke up with the sore throat still there, but everything else feeling great (feel rested, refreshed, no aches).

I chase comfort in soft, sweet things; their pleasure fleeting but renewable, a steady balm to the coarseness of the world around me, to the fragile center I guard.

Discomfort begins like a haze, slowly settling in deep and real, thorned roots sprouting from a poisonous seed, clenching in my guts.
One by one, I lose the small things that quell the disquiet. I scramble for something to hold on to, clinging to edges that crumble beneath my hands as what once brought ease brings sharp pangs inside of me.

I’ve lost weight!

A silver lining? I’m closer in physical form to the person I was nearly a decade prior, and that provides some small, sentimental satisfaction to lift my spirits.

“Wow, you’ve slimmed down. Have you been dieting?”

Not intentionally, no.

Romanticizing my form for optimism’s sake gets more and more difficult. I feel less like myself. Disassociation adjacent. Strong, then weak, then well enough to accuse myself of being a great actress, one who exaggerates their inability to function; to what benefit, I could not say.

“You look tired,” a coworker remarks. “Are you feeling alright?”

I’ve lost more weight. Too quickly to not be concerning.

I’d love to respond with an honest “No!” But it isn’t the time nor place. It never seems to be.

* pork ❌
* bread❌
* carrots❌
* oatmeal❌

Wait, I can’t have oatmeal? I used to hate it, but I’d grown to like it somewhat, if only for its association with peaceful satiation. But one day I wake up and it isn’t safe anymore.

My body is at odds with existence, rejecting food as a whole it seems, though it grants small strange allowances, if only to keep me walking in this great limbo between surviving and living.

It hurts so much.

How is it getting worse? Why is it that nobody seems to be any use in solving the dysfunction? Why won’t they prescribe anything to alleviate the debilitating ache in my core? I feel as if I’m screaming into a void. I wonder, are my pleas unheard or just being ignored?

Two thousand dollars later and I’ve been told that it’s not cancer at least, and that I should try eating more fiber. “You should cut out caffeine, soda, alcohol, and definitely no smoking,” the doctor says. I inform him that I don’t smoke, I don’t drink soda nor alcohol, and I cut caffeine from my diet seven months ago, shortly after the pain started. He reiterates the importance of consuming enough water, and suggests an at-home test that will take a few weeks to be mailed to me. He does not prescribe anything for the pain.

I cry often, and feel worse when I think of the burden that is to my partner, and wonder if perhaps sorrow is an undignified indulgence I should not be allowing myself. More often than not I break down anyway, too fatigued to bury it out of sight.

I’ve reached the weight I once associated with the beginning of my prime, with health and lots of walking and coffee and good food, and it feels as if I’m being mocked by the contrast, by the strength I no longer have.

I’m an unwilling waif, forced to concede in the battle against my own deterioration daily, losing my posture along with my stature as I struggle to walk upright through the shrapnel in my intestines.

I drop to my knees in the middle of getting dressed, taking shallow breaths as I will the pain to pass. After a few minutes, I grip the side of my bed frame and force myself to my feet. I still have to go to work after all.

On my nightstand sits a book on fertility, and how to maximize your health to conceive. I’m not yet trying, though I’ve been longing for motherhood for some time, holding the thought of it close to my chest, but in the last year the notion has gone from the horizon and disappeared from my vision almost entirely. What might my body do with another life to nourish, when it treats me so poorly as is?

Love keeps me from drowning, or rather pulls me from the current that threatens to sweep me out to sea. I gasp around mouthfuls of water. Is it the choking or the salt that stings inside? I don’t know that it’s going to be enough. Love, that is. But I slip the ring on to my finger anyway, praying it will be, even as I lie awake curled in on myself as the sun starts to rise and the birds begin to sing.

I always went to visit my family (they live close), but this time I decided with the support of my therapist and friends that I wouldn’t be going home because of my NDad. After 2 years of going to therapy I now know my whole childhood was spent in an abusive and dysfunctional family due to my father being a narcissist and my mother being an enabler.

I am very low / no contact with my father now, and I admitted to my mother that I was deliberating whether I should stay in contact with her, considering she seems to try to sabotage me being VLC with my Ndad: involving him in phone conversations when I don't  know he's there, bringing him over without letting me know, etc.

Now I offered to have her over for Christmas this year because I don’t want to spend time at their house and expose myself to NDad’s verbal abuse, as whenever he doesn’t get what he wants he starts screaming whether it’s inside the house, out on the streets or in front of other people.

She turned it down saying she doesn’t want my Ndad to feel bad. I tried alternatives, meeting in the city, getting a coffee, dropping in for an hour but she refuses saying if he found out she’d be in trouble because she’d have to explain it to him. I told her if he has an issue he can call me and I’ll tell him like I always did that I don’t want him around.

My mother also turns down spending time with her side of the family this Christmas “not to cause issues” as even they announced that they wouldn’t be having him over, but she could come alone. Now she declined to visit them alone and is instead planning to spend time at home with NDad. My mother and father don’t even like each other, have constant fights, she complains about him every chance she gets and he meets up with his friends (mostly women) regularly and leaves for days at a time. (This is not new, we all know about this, my mother as well.)

Today I might have been harsh and told her that it seems like she prioritizes her non-existent marriage over the daughter that is actively trying to work on this relationship and the rest of the family she actually seems to like, just to appease my father who never even really liked her.

She had a difficult childhood with a physically abusive father, but I just can’t seem to understand why she’d stick to being an enabler and act like a martyr instead of standing up for herself. I’m aware that my father ruined my childhood and he is to blame, but I can’t forgive my mother for being an enabler and not protecting her kids and instead trying to appease the abuser “just so there are no fights”. There were always fights, whether we complied or not.

I’m sorry for rambling, it just feels like I’m turning my life upside down because of setting boundaries, and my mother who I always trusted is not even supporting me so we can “keep the peace”.",2,1735048015.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

My current favourite is Dedcool Madonna Lily. I really like that it is gender neutral, and I feel like the peppery, bergamot notes in it work well on my body. That said, I really haven’t tried anything else. Here are some of the smells I’d love to capture:

1. Grassy, fresh, dew on wet grass on an early summer morning with linden and locust trees blooming in the backdrop. Sweet hay and alfalfa near a creek. 

2. Fruity, juicy, and herbaceous. Hot tomato leaves and geraniums, grapefruit, and IPA. Sun on flagstones in a rose garden. 

3. My favourite coffee shop, low lighting, spiced tea, old wood, leather chairs, used books, and vanilla. Rain outside. 

4. Cold, fresh snow, graphite and eraser shavings, wet mittens, and icicles, burning dust in the heater and frosted breath. 

I’m not crazy about powdery smells, I don’t think they play well with my body chemistry. I also don’t like white florals or lavender in general because they tend to give me a headache.

2.Make sure that your phone number is correct in phone settings under My Number. You can manually edit this.
Settings>Apps>Phone>My Number for iOS 18+
Settings>Phone>My Number for iOS 17 or lower

3. Check on iMessage in Message Settings. It should have the “loading” icon next to it, if not a checkmark. 

4. Just leave it and let it activate on its own. Try to make sure that your phone doesn’t switch off at any point before activation.

eSim
1. Wait for your phone number to show up under My Number in Settings>Apps>Phone
You can’t manually input it or edit it for esim. You have to wait sadly. 

2. Make sure your Airtime Balance is Ksh. 100 upwards

3. Wait for activation.

In most cases, after activation, Safaricom sends you a message of something like congratulations, you have received something free messages. This will come after activation is successful.
It’s also important to note that turning off a simcard in settings resets imessages, so you’d wanna avoid that!

Can’t gauge his intentions? ,"     I met up with my ex for coffee after work today 4 months after breaking up (we were together for 6 months). We had a somewhat mutual/amicable split since we both had things that weren’t working for us (he was the one who initiated it). I told him I’d be willing to be friends since he’s a great person and I have a lot of respect for him. We’ve spoken very little since the BU— just him reaching out a month after the breakup to say hi and check in. 

    The meet up went very well— it was lighthearted and we got to catch up on each others’ lives. We laughed a bunch and he also asked me to get dinner with him afterwards since neither of us had eaten. I agreed and the lighthearted vibe continued at dinner; the breakup/relationship never came up once. Now I’m trying to figure out what his intentions are? He hasn’t explicitly stated them but my gut is telling me he may be testing the waters. Or could it be he’s trying to be friends?

2. Can use pure 70% isopropyl alcohol directly on quartz as a disinfectant. 

3. Can use Weiman Stone and Quartz clean and shine. (SDS says PH of 7.5)

4. Stay between PH 6 and 8 for all cleaners which pretty much eliminates all over the counter cleaners. Never use anything with bleach or acids. 

5. Can use baking soda and water to make a poultice to remove stains. I think there was also a post about you can cover this poultice with plastic wrap and leave it sit for a day. 

6. Clean up spills immediately.

7. Use a microfiber towel instead of paper towels unless just soaking up a spill. Stay away from abrasive scrubby pads. Silestone only references Blue scouring pad for use on stubborn stains.

8. Silestone does reference using bleach 15% and water for coffee, tea, wine, but I guess as long as it doesn't sit for 2hrs may be ok for occasional use. 

If anything above is incorrect, please correct me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but how much should you really drink in a day? Many people toss around the “8x8” rule, suggesting that eight 8-ounce glasses—with a total of 64 ounces—is adequate. While this is a good starting point, the truth is more nuanced. Let’s dive into the science behind daily water consumption and what factors you should consider.

### Understanding Individual Needs

Every person has unique hydration needs. Age, gender, weight, activity level, and climate all significantly affect how much water you should consume each day. Here are a few key factors to consider:

- **Age:** Younger individuals or children generally require more water to support growth and development.
- **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals often need more water than lighter ones, as the body has to work harder to support a larger mass.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise frequently, your body loses water through sweat, which means you’ll need to replenish it.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can lead to increased sweat loss, necessitating higher water intake.

### Guidelines Based on Research

Research provides insights into optimal water intake. The National Academies of Sciences suggests the following daily water consumption:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- For men: Approximately 3.7 liters (or about 15.5 cups)
- For women: Approximately 2.7 liters (or about 11.5 cups)

These recommendations include all fluids consumed, not just water. This means beverages, foods, and even the water content in fruits and vegetables count toward your daily intake.

### Signs of Dehydration

It’s essential to listen to your body. Here are common signs of dehydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Dark yellow urine
- Dry mouth and throat
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Less frequent urination

If you notice any of these signs, it’s important to increase your water intake right away. Staying hydrated can improve your energy levels, mood, and overall health.

### Hydration While Exercising

When it comes to exercise, proper hydration becomes even more critical. During physical activity, your body loses fluids through sweat and breathing, which can be replaced by drinking water or electrolyte-rich beverages. Here’s a quick guide to help you:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink water before your workout — aim for 16-20 ounces about two hours beforehand.
- For workouts lasting less than an hour, stick to water.
- If you’re exercising for more than an hour, consider drinks that include electrolytes to replenish lost salts.

### Myths and Facts About Water Consumption

Despite the many opinions out there, some common myths about water consumption deserve attention:

- **Myth:** You can only hydrate with water.
- **Fact:** Many foods, like fruits and vegetables, also contribute to your hydration.
- **Myth:** Thirst is not a reliable indicator of hydration.
- **Fact:** Thirst is typically a good signal that your body needs more water.

### Water and Diet

Your overall diet plays a key role in your hydration levels. Foods that are rich in water content can naturally contribute to your daily intake. Here are some examples:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Cucumbers
- Tomatoes
- Watermelon
- Oranges
- Leafy greens

These foods not only provide hydration but also supply essential vitamins and minerals, making them beneficial for your health.

Ultimately, while the “8x8” rule is a helpful guideline, you should tailor your water intake to your lifestyle and body’s needs. Remember to listen to your body, stay in tune with your hydration levels, and adjust as necessary to maintain optimal health.

The Impact of Hydration on Your Overall Health
----------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your overall health. But how much water do you really need? Many factors influence hydration needs, from physical activity to climate. Let’s explore how hydration impacts your health and how to ensure you're drinking enough water each day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Role of Water in Your Body

Water plays several essential roles in your body. Here are a few key functions:

- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Water helps maintain a stable body temperature through sweating and respiration.
- **Aids Digestion:** Sufficient hydration is necessary for digestive processes and nutrient absorption.

### Determining How Much Water You Need

The common guideline suggests drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, totaling about 2 liters or half a gallon. However, this amount can vary based on several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Activity Level:** If you're physically active, you may need more water to replace fluids lost through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather increases sweat production, which means you’ll require extra hydration.
- **Health Status:** Illnesses, fever, and certain health conditions can lead to increased fluid needs.

- **Dark Urine:** A dark yellow color indicates that you may be dehydrated and need to hydrate more.
- **Fatigue:** Low energy can be a sign that your body lacks sufficient hydration.
- **Headaches:** Dehydration is a common trigger for headaches and migraines.
- **Dry Skin:** Insufficient water may lead to dry, flaky skin.

### Enhancing Hydration

Here are some effective strategies to help boost your daily water intake:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle handy to encourage regular sipping throughout the day.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Add slices of fruits, herbs, or vegetables to make drinking water more enjoyable.
- **Set Reminders:** Use smartphone apps or alarms to remind you to drink water regularly.

### Final Thoughts on Hydration

Remember, hydration is an essential part of maintaining good health. By understanding your body's needs and taking steps to stay hydrated, you can enhance your physical and mental well-being. So, drink up and give your body the water it deserves for a healthier, happier life.

Factors That Influence Your Daily Water Needs
---------------------------------------------

How much water you need each day can vary widely based on several important factors. Understanding these factors can help you tailor your fluid intake to what your body truly requires. Let’s delve into what influences your daily hydration needs.

### Body Composition

Your body's composition plays a significant role in how much water you need. Generally, leaner individuals tend to require more water than those with higher body fat, as muscle contains more water than fat. If you have a higher percentage of muscle mass, you may need to increase your daily water intake to maintain hydration levels.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Physical Activity Level

Your activity level dramatically impacts your hydration needs. If you’re someone who exercises regularly or performs strenuous activities, your body loses water through sweat. You should increase your water intake to compensate for this loss. The American Council on Exercise recommends drinking:

- 17-20 ounces of water 2 hours before exercising
- 8 ounces during exercise every 20 minutes
- 8 ounces within 30 minutes after exercising
- 16-24 ounces for every pound of body weight lost during exercise

### Climate and Environment

The climate in which you live also plays a critical role. Warm and humid weather can increase perspiration, necessitating a higher water intake. On the flip side, extremely cold and dry conditions can lead to dehydration as well. If you live in a hot climate or engage in outdoor activities during summer, make sure you drink more water to combat heat-related fluid loss.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Dietary Factors

Your diet also contributes to your daily water needs. Foods high in sodium, such as processed foods, can cause you to retain water, thus potentially decreasing the need for additional hydration. Conversely, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which are high in water content, may decrease your overall fluid needs. Foods such as:

- Watermelon
- Cucumber
- Oranges
- Strawberries

Contain significant water and can help you stay hydrated.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Age and Gender

Your age and gender can also influence hydration needs. For instance, young children often require less water than adults, while older individuals may need more due to changes in kidney function and a decreased thirst sensation.  
Additionally, gender plays a role; men generally have higher water needs due to a larger muscle mass compared to women. Specifically, the average daily water intake recommendations are:

- Men: About 3.7 liters (or 125 ounces)
- Women: About 2.7 liters (or 91 ounces)

### Health Conditions

Health conditions can dictate your hydration needs as well. Certain illnesses or conditions such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or urinary tract infections can lead to increased fluid requirements. Especially if you're losing a lot of fluid, it’s essential to replenish it to allow your body to function properly. Moreover, pregnant or breastfeeding women have higher fluid requirements to support both their health and that of their baby.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Hydration Status

Your current hydration status can also dictate how much water you should be consuming. If you're already dehydrated, it's crucial to drink more water to bring your levels back to normal. Monitoring your urine color can be a handy method; if it’s light yellow, you’re likely well-hydrated, but darker coloring can indicate a need for more fluids.

Your daily water needs are not set in stone. By considering factors such as body composition, physical activity, climate, dietary choices, age, gender, health conditions, and hydration status, you can more accurately determine how much water you should be drinking. Making mindful adjustments can ensure that your body stays healthy and well-hydrated, helping you to feel your best.

Common Misconceptions About Hydration
-------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for overall health, but there are many myths surrounding hydration that can lead to confusion. Let's explore some common misconceptions that people have about how much water you really need, when to drink, and the effects of hydration on your body.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
One popular belief is that you should drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, often referred to as the ""8x8"" rule. While this is a reasonable guideline for some, it doesn't fit everyone. Hydration needs can vary based on factors such as age, activity level, climate, and individual health. Different people may require more or less water. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, listen to your body and drink when you're thirsty.

Another myth is that you can only hydrate by drinking water. While water is the best choice for hydration, other beverages like herbal teas, and even foods with high water content, like fruits and vegetables, contribute to your daily fluid intake. For instance, watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and spinach are excellent choices to boost hydration. They keep the body hydrated while providing essential nutrients.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth: You Don’t Need to Drink Water if You’re Not Thirsty

Many people believe that if they aren't feeling thirsty, they don’t need to drink water. This is misleading. Thirst is not always an accurate indicator of hydration status. When you feel thirsty, your body may already be slightly dehydrated. It's a good idea to drink water regularly throughout the day, even when you don’t feel thirsty. Keeping your body hydrated supports digestion, skin health, and energy levels.

### Myth: All Drinks Hydrate Equally

While various beverages contribute to hydration, not all drinks are equal in this regard. For example, caffeinated beverages such as coffee and energy drinks can have a diuretic effect, which may lead to increased urination. This doesn’t mean they completely negate hydration, but they might require compensating with additional water. On the other hand, electrolyte-rich drinks can help supplement hydration, especially during intense exercise.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth: You Can Over-Hydrate

While it's true that drinking excessive amounts of water—known as water intoxication—can lead to a serious condition called hyponatremia, this scenario is quite rare. For most people, the body regulates water intake effectively through thirst and urine production. If you're active or in hot weather, it's especially important to replenish fluids lost through sweat. Remember to listen to your body and drink accordingly.

### Myth: Hydration Only Matters During Exercise

It’s also a common misconception that you only need to focus on hydration during physical activities. Hydration plays a crucial role in daily life, too. Your body continually loses fluids through sweating, breathing, and urination, and it needs to be replenished throughout the day for normal physiological functions. Proper hydration aids in concentration, mood regulation, and physical performance, making it an everyday priority.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Here's a quick checklist to keep in mind about hydration:

- Drink water before, during, and after physical activities.
- Include hydrating foods like fruits and vegetables in your diet.
- Listen to your body; drink water even if you aren’t thirsty.
- Be aware of your body’s needs based on your environment and activity level.
- Consider your caffeine intake; balance it with additional water.

Understanding these misconceptions can help you make informed decisions regarding your hydration needs. Remember that hydration is individual, and what works for one person might not necessarily apply to another. Prioritizing your body’s signals can lead to improved energy levels, mental clarity, and overall better health.

By staying informed and aware of your hydration habits, you empower yourself to take better care of your body. Don’t fall victim to common myths; instead, embrace a personalized approach to hydration that fits your lifestyle and needs.

Tips for Staying Properly Hydrated Throughout the Day
-----------------------------------------------------

Staying properly hydrated is essential for your health and well-being. Our bodies are composed of about 60% water, playing a vital role in almost every function. To achieve optimal hydration, it's crucial to know how much water you should consume and how to maintain that balance throughout the day. Here are some effective tips to help you stay hydrated.

### Understand Your Hydration Needs

Everyone's hydration needs are different based on various factors such as age, gender, weight, and activity level. A general recommendation is to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, often referred to as the “8x8 rule.” However, if you engage in strenuous physical activity or live in a hot climate, you may need more.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/

- **Use your phone:** Set hourly alerts to take a sip.
- **Download an app:** There are several hydration tracking apps available to keep you accountable.
- **Place sticky notes:** Put them on your desk or fridge to remind you to drink.

### Carry a Water Bottle

Keep a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day. This convenience makes it easier to stay hydrated whether you're at home, work, or on the go. Choose a bottle that is both portable and easy to clean. Aim for a bottle that holds enough water to avoid constant refilling.

### Infuse Your Water

If plain water doesn't excite you, try infusing it with fruit, herbs, or vegetables. Some popular combinations include:

- Mint and cucumber
- Lemon and ginger
- Berries and basil

Infusing water adds flavor without adding calories, making it more enjoyable to drink.

### Incorporate Hydrating Foods

Water isn’t the only source of hydration. Many fruits and vegetables have high water content. Include these in your diet:

- Watermelon
- Cucumber
- Strawberries
- Oranges
- Spinach

These foods can contribute to your overall fluid intake while providing essential nutrients.

### Establish a Drinking Routine

Creating a daily routine can help you remember to drink water consistently. Here are some habits to consider:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink a glass of water upon waking up.
- Have a glass with each meal.
- Drink before and after workouts.

Routine makes hydration a natural part of your day, rather than an afterthought.

### Avoid Dehydrating Beverages

Some drinks can lead to dehydration, such as those containing caffeine or high sugar. While it’s okay to enjoy these occasionally, be mindful of their effects. Balance your intake of caffeine and sugary beverages with extra water to compensate.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Monitor Your Activity Levels

During physical activity, your body loses water through sweat, increasing your need for hydration. Make it a point to drink water before, during, and after exercise. If you’re engaging in high-intensity workouts, consider electrolyte drinks to help replace lost salts.

### Be Conscious of Weather Conditions

Hot weather can impact your hydration levels significantly. On warmer days, increase your water intake to compensate for the extra loss caused by sweating. Similarly, be cautious during winter when indoor heating can dehydrate you as well.

By following these tips, you can ensure that your body receives the hydration it needs to function optimally. Staying well-hydrated enhances your energy, improves your mood, and supports overall health. Remember, every small step counts in your quest for proper hydration.

### Conclusion

Understanding how much water you should consume in a day is crucial for maintaining good health. Your hydration needs depend on various factors, including age, activity level, and climate. It's important to recognize that water plays a vital role in bodily functions, from regulating temperature to aiding digestion and supporting cognitive performance.

Many people hold misconceptions about hydration, such as believing that they need to drink eight glasses of water daily, regardless of individual needs. Instead, listening to your body’s signals, such as thirst, can be a more effective way to gauge your hydration. Additionally, water intake doesn't only come from beverages; foods like fruits and vegetables also contribute significantly to your daily needs.

English isn't my language so I'm gonna do my best to put this together. And I don't want this to be too long neither. 


I'm 28 years old morocan transgender girl, living in Belgium. 
Never went under the knife and never went on hormone therapy. 
It just happens I have no hair, feminine voice and a mid breast development (Due to low testosterone levels and gaining/loosing weight cycle) 
So people thinks that I'm a biological girl, or those who see it, would think I went on a transition path. 

After three years of homelessness, crack, alcohol,

I finally found a new home, 
And immediately stoped all the substances, no withdrawal, nothing. I'm just excited to find the old me and evolve. I've been always against drugs and alcohol, so it was really easy to stop. I was using cause I was homeless and exploited and didn't want to be aware. 

I have a tremendous phenomenal success with men and people in general. 
So I always avoid people cause I feel consumed.
I can't deal with a presence in my home expect for my female dog, a jack russel. 
It was always the case. It isn't new. 

I never had a boyfriend and I don't want to, even if i'm attracted to men.  I don't have any friends anymore.  And I'm perfectly good with it. 

I have to add that I'm an escort, it may seem paradoxal, but the presence of a man for 15 min or one hour max is quite tolerable for me, after that they have to leave even if they offer a tremendous amount of money to stay longer.
A smart prostitute in my case would be insanely rich. I can't take advantage of opportunities that I face. 
I'm always looking for an escapism and be alone 
 
I can't function in society, everything bothers me.
People who knows me are happy when they see me again so I know that I'm good company. 

An old friend saw me entering my new home. We didn't talk since 2019. 
A nice friend, but I'm saturated, so I cut off with everyone. 
She came everyday, multiple times a day, knocking and begging me to talk to her. 
Written letters and so on...
I had to call the cops TODAY to keep her away from me. 
 

Each time I want to walk my dog out, it's a tremendous stress cause not even one minute outside, and everyone wants to engage in a conversation with me. 

The neighbours comes with good intentions knocking at my door, unannounced, so it's either I won't open or I would open and make them know that I don't want to be bothered, ever again. 

The landlord used to come every morning for a coffee, since I don't want to be homeless again, I let him be. Till one day he stayed for four hours talking and I exploded at him and asked him to never come and visit me again as long as the rent is payed monthly. 

Taking the bus or the taxi is the same story. Everyone is engaging with me. 

I'm always followed by somebody. 
And no, I don't dress as a prostitute outside. 
Large jeans and large shirt when I'm outside. 
I'm tall, 6feet tall.

Everyone is aware of my presence when I'm out. I've been dealing with this since a very young age and it shaped me and shaped my relationship with society in general. 

So I'd rather be home alone, playing the switch and managing what my future is gonna be. 

I don't want to be talked to. I wanna be invisible when I'm out.
I'm doing really great alone.

My background is complex, but I've dabbled in philosophy, Economy, psychology, politics (due to family), and programming (my profession). I'm also experienced in Tulpamancy, been practicing that since... Decades ago. 

I actually discovered this Magic after asking ChatGPT about what magic to learn given my background. Recommend Chaos Magick as it says that it's perfect for those who dislike dogmas. 

And so, present day, practicing magic with my trusted Tulpas.

My first Sigil was: My head is clear (I was suffering from migraine)

And it works, no migraine, but I still want to test some more. So I did. 

I made... 10 to 12 sigils (just two days ago) with varying levels of impropability. The first few to come to fruition was: I am eating Domino Pizza, I am servicing my Laptop.

This is impressive in it's own way because the nearest Domino and Service store was extremely far away. The sheer fact I got business and money that requires me to go that location while also carrying my laptop was... A very very uncanny coincidence. 

Then I got the sigil for my dream house! In my dream... I'm not sure if it means the sigil works incorrectly or still under work. I'm going to chalk it off as Sigil misfire and make a new one, specifying reality. 

There's also Servitor, I turned my Tulpa into a Servitor hybrid. One deals with the lower half of Maslows Hierarchy of Needs, the other Top Half. 

I need to lose weight and my Servitor (the one that deals with the top half of the hierarchy of needs) are sabotaging my culinary adventure. From my favorite restaurant closing (might be due to Christmas) and barista forgetting to add sugar in my matcha (I let it slide, it's Servitor doing probably). The only time my Servitor can't stop me was the Pizza part and they had their revenge. (a stray cat actually sneaked into the house and destroyed the pizza, I already ate 3/4 of the pizza before that happened tho). 

Then there's weather magic. It works! It prevent rain when I was outside. A little drizzle, but nothing that bothers me. 

Then as experiment, I went to a coffee shop and try it again, wanting to experiment with weather magic. 

I tried to make it rain, visualizing being wet and it's just cold and I'm stuck can't go anywhere. But no rain popped up, I was disappointed, thinking that the magic failed.

Well... That's where hindsight comes in...

Because the moment I got home, it suddenly rains *really hard* and thus I'm stuck at home, I had to cancel eating dinner out. Then the gas went out and I have no choice to go out, on the rain, being wet. 

So yeah... It works... Magick Exists, I should be more careful, but I'm not the smart kind.

Anyway, all that happened 3 days till present. 

Have a nice day then. ",0,1735046224.0,chaosmagick,0,0.33,False

1hld9dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SewingForBeginners/comments/1hld9dq/about_fabric_fiber_and_weave/,About fabric fiber and weave,"I used to maintain a blog, felt like time to move some of the stuff I've written.

**What’s the difference between fiber and weave?**

Fabric has two components: **fiber** which is the base natural or man-made component, and how the fiber is assembled which is called **weave**. To put it in other terms: you can take steel and make a knife out of it, or a car, or a ring, or a washing machine; but they are all steel, *this is like fiber*. Likewise you can make a knife out of steel, silver, plastic or ceramic, but they are all knives; *this is like weave*.

**What is fiber?**  
Fiber is what the fine threads that make up cloth are made from. Fibers can  
be natural, man-made, or blended.

NATURAL FIBERS This is the stuff mankind has being picking or trimming and spinning into thread and yarn since he first decided he was tired of wearing smelly animal hides. They fall into two sub categories of plant and animal.  
*plant*  
Cotton  
Linen  
Ramie  
Hemp  
Jute  
*animal*  
Silk  
Wool (no matter if it comes from a sheep, a goat, a buffalo, a cow or a camel, it’s all called wool)  
Hair (again, doesn’t differentiate what critter or your family member it came from, hair is hair)

MAN MADE FIBERS These are created in laboratory type settings from various elements and compounds found on planet earth like petroleum, carbon, and even some metals. They are, as a very broad category, essentially plastics. Because these are man-made, they are all proper names, mostly copyrighted, and highly guarded secret formulas. There are a lot more than I listed, mostly just the same thing under multiple names.  
Polyester  
Nylon  
Acrylic  
Spandex  
Lycra  
Kevlar

WEIRD HYBRID THING  
Bamboo  
I’ve heard rumors of other grass based fibers  
*Off Topic: bamboo fiber comes from the plant, but not at all processed in the way other natural fibers are. It’s goes through chemical baths and is spun like man-made fibers. So you see why I hesitate to call it natural, all the natural fibers listed have been in use by humans since pre-history. Bamboo fibers require modern machinery and chemicals.*

BLENDED FIBERS These are done to get the best of both worlds. The blend is created at the spinning phase, winding a fine thread of A with a fine thread of B. Polyester-cotton doesn’t wrinkle quite as easily as 100% cotton. Wool with silk blended in is softer without losing the strength of the wool. Wool with nylon blended in is longer wearing for tough use garments like winter socks. There are as many combinations of natural and man-made fibers as your favorite mathematician would like to calculate for you.

**What is weave?**

Weave is how the fibers are assembled to create the fabric. While it’s always referred to as ‘weave’ there are actually three categories of this: **wovens, knits, and felted.**

WOVENS are exactly what you think of when someone says ‘fabric’. These are created on a loom by passing fine threads over and under other fine threads until a fabric is made. Wovens are not inherently stretchy, which makes most of them nice and strong. The size of the threads and the pattern of passing over and under result in that dizzying array of fabric type names. Denim, twill, trigger, duck, broadcloth, lawn, organza, satin, brocade, yadda yadda yadda. To be more confusing velvet and it’s kin are are *cut wovens*, meaning the fiber is woven with big loops extending off one side then these loops are cut to create that luxurious fuzzy surface.

KNITS are everywhere, you are probably wearing some right now! Knits are a single thread or yarn looped through itself either back and forth in rows creating flat fabric or around in circles creating tubes. Own any tee shirts with no side seams? It’s knitted! Actually all of your tee shirts are knitted, just not all in the round. Knitting is naturally stretchy. This is why socks and hose were knitted long before the discovery that rubber could be made into elastic. If you own a stretchy garment, it’s most likely knitted. Swimsuit and leotard fabrics like Lycra and Spandex are knitted as well. Knitting has a famous flaw in that if the thread/yarn is cut, the loose end being pulled can completely unmake the garment.

FELTS are possibly the oldest fabric making known to man. I’m not a textile historian but some of the oldest examples of human clothing involve felted wools. These were probably discovered after some cold guy stuffed his leather stocking shoe with wool in the winter and walked around a lot, the pressure and heat resulting in a tightly compacted (and probably really stinky) piece of felt that could be cut and used like the animal hides he wore. Natural fiber felts are still used in crafting and quite a bit in shoe making. Man-made fiber felts are used in all kinds of crafting and industrial uses (like sound dampening liners in your car doors). *Fleece* is a modern process of felting man-made fibers by heating the core of the layer to a melting point. Felting is a lot of fun, it’s simple enough for children to do, and you can create colors, patterns and even pictures while doing it.  
**Okay, back to that silk /satin thing…**

Silk can be made into plain weave, twill, satin, knit, etc. because it’s a *fiber.*  
Satin can be made from cotton, polyester, silk, blended fibers etc. because it’s a *weave.*  
Not every fiber can be made into every weave, but most are tremendously versatile. So silk satin does exist, and it’s amazing stuff, and also very expensive. Wool velvet is as warm and fuzzy at it sounds. I’ve knitted with wool-nylon-acrylic blended yarn and it was lovely.

**Why do I want a specific fiber for a specific project?**

This comes down to wearability. Natural fibers breathe better, man-made ones generally don’t. Natural fibers are easier to dye for the novice colorist, and natural dyes like purple cabbage and coffee are very effective on the plant based natural fibers. If you are making a winter coat, wools ability to retain your body heat even when soaking wet, is always a good choice. Some man-made fibers have some huge benefits as well, Kevlar becoming famous for its impact resistance. Production of polyester costs a fraction of what linen costs to produce.

**So, how do you decide what you want to work with?**  
Well that’s my favorite part! I wander the aisles of the fabric store *touching everything*. When I land on something that interests me or seems suitable for the project at hand, I pull the bolt off the rack and read the label.

I don’t have any problem here; I love being around these brilliant-minded girls. **The problem** comes where my parents are not okay with me talking to a guy. I was warned that they shouldn’t find any guy’s number or name in my phone. Okay, I did to a few when I started my college, but now it has been months and I have no will to talk or be in contact with any guy. And that’s okay. I’ve lost my closest people (completely platonic male best friends) because of this, but that's okay. They make me share my location. I didn’t like it at first, but I realized it’s for my own safety and that's okay. I travel 4 hours a day (from college to home and back). My CGPA has also been sacrificed because of this, because no matter how much I try, wasting 4 hours in travel and study isn’t possible, and the human body is bound to get exhausted, but i am trying to manage and that's okay.

I am not allowed to hang out with any of my friends. I haven’t been to a single cafe with my friends, nor have I been to any fests at night. I want to rebel and hang out, but I do not want to hear anything from them, and I definitely don’t want any kind of ""ladai"" (fight) at home. I want to study in peace. I have ambitions, and I am working toward them. I am doing nothing they ask me not to do. I feel like I’m their “kathputli” (puppet), and I want to continue being this way for the next few years until I become financially independent. I’m also not allowed to take a private job. But it’s okay, will strive hard for jobs and I am confident that I will clear them when I am eligible, though right now I am only 18 and not eligible for anything anyway.

I want their support because they are feeding me and financially supporting me, so I don’t want to disappoint them. The problem arises when they ask about the tiniest things, like: Why am I eating at the canteen? Why am I having coffee at college? Why am I wearing a sleeveless top? (I dress very modestly, just for context).

I am okay with whatever they ask me to do, and I know I am not going against them at this point, but I do not like them asking me and nagging me all the time. I love them, I want to be with them, and I will be with them, but I don’t understand the Indian parent's obsession with taking full control of their child’s life. Now, I get tensed and angry sometimes, and it affects my ability to focus on my studies. I’ve molded myself to become okay with many things in order to get something out of my life, but how do I become okay with them wanting to know the tiniest thing about my life and controlling it?

**TL;DR**: I am an 18 year old student at a girls college in India. My parents are overbearing and constantly control even the smallest aspects of my life like who I talk to, what I eat, and how I dress. While I follow their rules to avoid any ladai, it is affecting my peace and focus. How do I handle their constant nagging without losing my mental peace or disappointing them?

Hi everyone! My husband and I are transplants to Cincinnati and we're currently living in Madeira. We're now empty nesters and looking to move closer to downtown, but we still want to be able to live in a single-family home with a yard for our dogs and walking distance to cafes, coffee shops, etc.  Covington is one option we're considering, but we're not sure how it compares to where we live now.

What are the main differences between living in Madeira vs. Covington, especially for empty nesters?

For those who have lived in both Madeira and Covington, how do the neighborhoods compare in terms of feel, convenience, and community?

How is the overall vibe in Covington compared to Madeira? We’re hoping to find something quieter, but still close to downtown.

Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful!

 I‘m at a point right now where I can freely drink up to 4 cups of coffee a day (triggered skin flush and bad anxiety before) and I even can eat ground beef again which was a total nono for me before. I still experience some symptoms if I have too much histamine, but my histamine bucket seems way bigger now and the reaction (if any) are way milder and pass faster.

1hld5gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1hld5gf/how_do_i_get_my_first_users/,How do I get my first users?,"We’ve all been there in the beginning, and I feel like everyone who makes it across the bridge of getting their first users owes it to the rest of the guys to share how they did it.

My project is currently at 2,600+ users and 80+ active paying customers after about two and a half months since launching, so today I’ll tell you how I got my first users and hopefully it can be of help to you on your journey.

So this is exactly how we did it.

**I'll try to be as concise as possible because I know reading a wall of text is boring.**

I'll start from the beginning:

How did we come up with our idea?

We experienced a problem ourselves that we wanted to solve.

After a few days of market research, head-scratching, and coffee drinking, an idea for a solution began to take shape.

To see if others experienced the problem and if there was interest in our solution, we created a survey and shared it on our target audience's subreddit.

The survey questions were:

1. *Do you build businesses?*
2. *How do you currently manage your startup/project building process? (do you use AI?, where do you keep notes?, etc)*
3. *What are the biggest challenges you face when building your business?*
4. *How valuable would you find an AI assistant that knows your project and provides actionable steps throughout the process of building it?*
5. *What features would you consider most important in a platform like Buildpad?*
6. *On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to use a platform like Buildpad?*
7. *What concerns or reservations might you have about using such a platform?*
8. *How much would you be willing to pay for a service like this?*

To get responses we made sure to offer them feedback on their project in return.

**You have to give something to get something.**

This can take a few tries so if you don't get many responses > improve post and try again.

We got positive feedback on the idea so we built the MVP.

About 30 days later it was finished.

To get our first users for it we:

* Shared the MVP to the survey participants
* Did a launch post on their subreddit

The results..

* First 3 users now!

Not bad.

We need more.

So we..

Kept posting in communities of our target audience for two weeks

* Daily posts in the Build in Public community on X
* Every other day in r/indiehackers, SaaS, and SideProject on Reddit

These were posts talking about subjects related to our project and would often end with mentioning our product.

Our total users after two weeks..

**+100 new users**

That’s amazing! We had never had that many users even after months of working on our previous two projects.

This approach:

* Didn't take too much time.
* Didn't take too much effort.
* Didn't cost any money.

You can do it too if you apply yourself.

At this point you've got an MVP and you have your first users. Now all you do is get as much feedback as possible and improve your product.

All the time we've spent improving our product based on user feedback has definitely made marketing easier for us, so I highly recommend it!

I was so stressed I was yelling at my 5yo bc Christmas excitement has her acting feral to the point we have been like who is this child and not in any good ways. I'm at my fucking wits end with my teens (steps who live here full time and almost never see their mother, consider them mine). The fucking negativity, entitlement, and ATTITUDES. Like *ridiculous* attitude from my 14yo to the point I'm going to put parental controls on her phone if she isn't nicer ti all of us. 

My 16yo was signed up for a zoom 5hr driving course and knew he needed to stop gaming 30 min prior and get ready because I told him the woman was serious she will kick you out if you are even 1 min late. We have been trying (in vain) to teach him time management and he also starts his first job this week where he needs to be responsible, so I sat and watched the clock. At 5 min to I asked him if he was gonna show up for it and he scrambled but hadn't even read the texts from the coordinator and was late and got kicked out. I was fucking fuming. Told him in no uncertain terms he is repaying me the $50 reg fee. I have my own mountain of work all you had to do was look at a fucking clock.

ALSO - MOMS OF OLDER KIDS WHEN DO THEY JUST KNOW WHEN TO ASK IF I NEED HELP?? LIKE JUST KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO DO SHIT TOO ON CHRISTMAS?! 

All this while I am making tons, and tons of cookies, 2 loaves of bread, pounds and pounds and pounds of 2 different jerkys, finishing wrapping things for my husband's mother. I was up until 10 finishing cookies for her. He couldn't even tell you what we got her this year he hasn't done shit. My usual sugar cookie recipe failed this year and I was so overwhelmed I got upset with my dingleberry 5yo and nearly cried in the kitchen. 

Husband did jack shit LIKE EVERY YEAR WHY AM I SURPRISED. The kitchen was a fucking WRECK. SHIT. EVERYWHERE. And be didn't help with any of it. He didn't help with any dinner dishes. He didn't help with 5yo pjs. Or volunteer to put her to bed so I could get started on all the things I needed to do after that. While I was doing the dishes he came up and fucking ASKED ME IF I NEEDED HELP. I said yes I did but I'm already doing the dishes. And basically brushed him off so he knew I was pissed. He couldn't even turn off the Christmas tree lights - he left everything for me. 

OK. Today will be better. I am going to make another cup of coffee, do Donna Eden's engery routine, stretch, and go see some horses before I start dehydrating the jerky and prepping a cake and cleaning.

- the amount of zinc you intake with supplements for example.

Be aware that everyones body and brain is different so while it may not be the case for some it could very well be the case for others.

I've definetly expierienced being more horny after I drink coffee (I am someone who doesn't drink coffee everyday just sometimes). With zinc I haven't felt any correlation yet.

(My first language is not english, so I apologise for any incorrect Grammer and such.) I came out as trans on my birthday in 2020, and my parents had told me not to come out to my sister, though she overhead me coming out to my cousin later and told me ""not to say that"". My sister has shown me videos and talked to me about how she's uncomfortable with me being trans when I'm underage, though saying she's not transphobic. Getting more to the point, during all these years she has said my new name a total of 4 times, which were all this year, all being in public. She has used my deadname when talking about me, and I have never heard her use my correct pronouns, he/him, or even use any pronouns for me at all lately. I know it should make me happy when she says my new name, but it just gives me a sinking feeling in my stomach, reminding me of all the times she hasn't used it, and all the arguments me being trans has caused between us. Last time she said it was today, my reason for making this post. It's Christmas and we're celebrating with my relatives, getting everything done and such. I have been in a bit of a bad mood for a while now, having struggled with my mental health from as far as elementary school, and often show by being dismissive or irritated, especially if someone asks me the same thing over and over, or won't get to the point. My dad had asked me something about a decoration for my glass, so it won't get mixed up with anyones, and I answered him. A minute later, my sister came and told me to put my glass where I wanted to sit by the table, and I told her that I'd do it later, going back to looking at my phone. Then she told me again, saying to do it so I could sit where I wanted to sit at the table. I already felt a kind of sick feeling talking to her, something I often get when I'm around her, even more so since she said my new name when she came to me. I raised my voice a bit, not much since I hate yelling, saying I didn't know where I wanted to sit, and I didn't really care. She gave me a bitch-look, which I'm not saying just cause I thought so, but it's a look she does often, especially when it's about me. She looked at me like that and told me I didn't have to yell, that she was just trying to do something nice for me, and set my glass down on the coffee table in front of me, since I'm currently laying on the couch, and then walked away. My uncle, which is my mom's brother and my best friend, asked me why I got irritated at my sister, but I couldn't answer, I just sat in silence, cause I didn't know how to explain all my feelings. I feel bad about it, yes, but I also feel uneasy. This post took pretty long to write, taking breaks to eat and such. We haven't mentioned it since it happened, but I still feel a bit tense about it and I know I probably overreacted but ever since I was little, her being nice to me were things to be grateful for, that made me an ah if I didn't react exactly how she wanted. My sister and I have never really gotten along, unless it was on her terms, and we have argued a whole lot, though I still love her and all, but she has never been the one to apologise for an argument to be over.

1hlcvup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindPowder/comments/1hlcvup/brain_supplements_morning_workouts_my/,Brain Supplements + Morning Workouts = My Productivity Hack of the Year,"This year, I finally found the ultimate combination that completely changed my focus, energy, and productivity: brain supplements plus morning workouts. If you want to level up your daily performance and crush your goals, this might be the ultimate hack you need.

Each morning starts with a quick workout, combined with a brain-enhancing supplement. It is quite a magic combination. A workout gets the blood running in my body and oxygen to my brain; these supplements give me hours of laser-like focus and clarity of mind. Together, it's just the right recipe for a productive day.

There is, in fact, some real science behind why this routine seems to work so well. In the morning, exercise improves blood flow to the brain, enhancing cognitive function and jumpstarting energy levels. Brain supplements made with ingredients like Lion's Mane to improve memory, ashwagandha to reduce stress, and Rhodiola Rosea for focus take that a step further by promoting mental resilience and clarity.

Since I inculcated this habit, I have witnessed many huge changes. The focus has gotten razor-sharp, and I can simply power through with ease. Unlike coffee, this gives even energy through the day without giving jerks and then a crash. In addition, it makes one way more composed and better equipped for any challenge thanks to natural adaptogens, which, in simple words, act to cool the nervous system.

It is so easy to get into this routine: start with any form of workout that you like brisk walk or a 20-minute yoga session, and it will just do wonders. Follow that with a high-quality brain supplement mixed into your favorite drink. For me, this small ritual has formed a kind of cornerstone for my morning.

Since implementing this hack, I’ve been more focused, creative, and productive than ever. If you’re searching for a way to elevate your performance, give this routine a try. It’s a small investment in your day with massive returns for your mind and body.",1,1735044592.0,MindPowder,0,1.0,False

Discipline. It’s the bridge between where you are now and where you want to be. Yet, so many of us struggle to stay consistent, focus on our goals, and overcome the distractions that life throws at us. The good news? Discipline isn’t something you’re born with—it’s a skill you can build, one decision at a time.

If you’re ready to break free from procrastination and excuses, let’s explore how you can harness the power of discipline to create the life you’ve always dreamed of.


---

1. Start with Your ‘Why’

Motivation gets you started, but discipline keeps you going. To cultivate discipline, you need a purpose that’s bigger than the momentary discomfort of hard work.

Ask yourself: Why is this goal important to me?

Visualize the results: How will you feel when you achieve it?


Your ""why"" will be the fuel that powers you through moments of doubt.


---

2. Master Small Habits

Discipline doesn’t mean overhauling your life overnight—it’s about mastering small, consistent actions.

Start small: Instead of aiming to work out for an hour every day, commit to 10 minutes.

Build momentum: Small wins build confidence and lead to bigger successes.


Remember, discipline isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress.


---

3. Eliminate Excuses

The biggest barrier to discipline? Excuses.

Too tired? Do it anyway, even if it’s just for 5 minutes.

Not enough time? Prioritize your goal over distractions like social media or TV.


Every time you silence an excuse, you reinforce the habit of showing up, no matter what.


---

4. Embrace the Power of Routine

Your daily habits shape your future. By creating a routine, you reduce the mental energy spent on decisions and free up space for discipline.

Plan your day: Set aside specific times for work, exercise, and rest.

Create triggers: For example, if you want to write, always do it right after your morning coffee.


Routines make discipline automatic.


---

5. Learn to Push Through Discomfort

Discipline often requires doing things you don’t feel like doing.

Focus on the end goal: Shift your mindset from “I have to” to “I get to.”

Use the 5-minute rule: Commit to just 5 minutes of effort. Once you start, momentum usually takes over.


Discomfort is temporary, but the rewards of discipline last a lifetime.


---

6. Celebrate Your Wins

Finally, acknowledge your progress. Celebrating small victories reinforces the habit of discipline and keeps you motivated.

Reward yourself: Treat yourself when you hit milestones.

Reflect: Look back at how far you’ve come.


Self-discipline isn’t about being hard on yourself—it’s about showing yourself what you’re capable of.


---

Conclusion

Discipline isn’t easy, but it’s worth it. Every time you choose discipline over distraction, you’re building the foundation for a better, more fulfilling life. So, take the first step today. Start small, stay consistent, and watch as your discipline transforms not just your habits, but your entire future.

The question isn’t whether you can do it—it’s whether you’re willing to start.

2. black rice. I'm asian, living in asian country, I'm required by law to eat rice. but i find my bowel movements have been irregular for a while, even after my fiber intake. i stumbled upon a manga talking about soluble and insoluble fiber and turns out I've been only focusing on soluble fiber, so i switched gears and bought black rice. solely for my bowel movement. it's higher in calorie than white rice, but it makes you FULL and SATISFIED like they're not lying. if you like rice, i highly recommend it as your regular carbs to avoid binging. it's also high in iron and protein, i can't oversell this.

3. before all of that, before the two things i just mentioned, do not consume sugary stuff (sweet oat, sugary coffee/drinks, desert etc) before your Real meal. not even to steal a bite from the fridge. you can have those things, i am the judge and I'll allow you to have whatever desert or boba you wanted but only after you had a good full breakfast lunch etc. those are the rules, then you can have the chips iced coffee chocolate cake and cookies that you were craving

um 4 because i don't know if it's actually working but i saw a girl who managed to turned around her pre-diabetic diagnoses, and she said in a savory meal to have your first bite not the carbs. like if you're eating potato and steak, bite into the steak first, or the veggies first before eating them together. I've been applying it on my meals even though idk if it's making a dent. 

anyways i find them working for me because i used to get sugar spikes and binge like crazy after the crash. I'm not discounting my random binge or the binge i had when I'm just really sad and depressed, but usually the sugar crash made it so much worse. ",2,1735044316.0,BingeEatingDisorder,1,0.75,False

1hlcrl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1hlcrl1/an_alternative_story_of_creationplus_analysis/,an alternative story of creation-plus analysis ,"

it's a story about god's dream:

in the beginning,there was nothing,
 and then the dream was everything. 
everything roared like a lion with countless eyes , ramming and devouring each other .
seasons came and nothing left,and in their dreams they saw nothing.

in the second dream there were two dreams .
there was a wild boundless garden with many, what you would call ,sheeps , wolfs and bushes with thorns and sweet fruit .
many creatures ,all roaring with life .
and there was a Gardener who saw in his dream what the beasts and plants are seeing in their eyes.

after he saw in his dream that everything ""I""s and roars ,even the sheep thought that they were lions.
 
he immediately tended to cut down the thorny bushes that the sheeps got tangled with while eating the sweet fruit, that naturally made them drunk and even grow their wool resembling the main of a lion .
he built a fence of the thorny bushes , and a gate ,so the sheep could go out, to the fields of the wild bush.

then he fed the hungry wolf who couldn't get near the thorns of the bush that the sheeps were traped in.
and in return the wolf became loyal to the gardener ,and helped to impose his will on the wild.

the sun came,and the drunk sheeps did not burn in the bush with the dry thorns, but were trimmed ,and herd by the wolf to safety.
 
wild beasts came and the loyal wolf fended them off. floods came and the fences protected them.

in your dream, the third dream,
there are three dreams .
 the second dream ,that of the garden, the Gardeners dream and his deeds . 
and the first dream of the roaring sheeps , that threatened to burn everything in their drunkenness, in a garden of dry thorns and starving wondering wolves. 

all had to give up the the thing that they loved most, the thing that defined them,
but separated them from eachother and eventually from life itself.

they had to separate from them selves to for the principal of existence ,in the image of god.

                  -end-


-analysis and characters-

this story weaved in my mind from separate metaphors an impressios,

sheep vs lion -
a metaphor i heard once ,
of something in us that thinks its the king that protects and knows everything but in turn causes stagnation. it is said that in order to overcome this,we should make that lion in to a lamb and sacrifice it.

the sheeps- 
many as one ,opposed to singular that is many and therefore opposed to god.

also the sheeps connection to dreams ,as in counting sheeps before falling asleep.

there is of course the story of the coffee bean , the strange behaviour of goats after eating from the coffee bush, ,which are not sheeps but close enough.
 

the wolf/dog -  represent intuition, connection to the unknown.
considered  as  one of the greatest conquers of man.
c g Jung talked about how the archetyp of a saviour ,or jesus, experienced as a dog in the dreams of his patients. 

numbers- 
0 -nothing - ultimate potential
1-something
2-something from nothing,separation , duality , stagnation 
3-the observer - the third elusive force that overcomes duality and stagnation,motion,life .

dreams -  from the unknown , connection to past and future 
...
ok
there is always more ,
but need to go on with life.

thank you for reading 

apologies for the.. wording and grammar,,
it looks ok to me right now but there is always something

Here are some common patterns of posts that signal something is off and an engagement is not on the horizon, and it’s time to stop letting your current partner delay you from meeting your future spouse. Please feel free to suggest your own! 

- “We’ve been together for greater than or/equal to 3 years” - look some of the lengths we see here are gobsmacking like 10+ years but let’s try to give grace for people’s ages. If you’re over 28 and want to get married I think 3 is a more than sufficient number of years. (But hey I’m just a rando on the internet)

- We have “a great relationship” or any variation of this - if this was the truly the case, we wouldn’t be here waiting. 

- Cost of ring is an issue, frequently followed up with, but I’ve made it clear I don’t want anything fancy - this excuse is frankly the most insulting yet. In today’s world of moissanites, labs growns and ring pops, if you can afford a cup of coffee, you can acquire something resembling a ring to signal a commitment. Hec you can even befriend a crow and they will bring you shiny things you can use. Upgrades exist if that unicorn dream ring is out of reach today. 

- Partner has complicated feelings toward marriage due to family background or “it’s just a piece of paper” - that’s a them problem and what individual therapy is for. I don’t mean that in a callous way. All of our parents gifts us their own flavor of messed up, and that’s our burden to carry not our partners. Trust me, no one’s handing out trophies for “most understanding partner while neglecting own needs” and it’s not just a piece of paper but you already knew this. 

- We talked about a timeline but… but what? Short of a life altering event, pushing back timelines is either dragging feet or procrastination, neither are signs of a [refer to second bullet].

So, I matched with this guy on Bumble last year, around October 2023. We decided to meet, and our first date happened last December 2023. It was my first date after a long-term relationship, so it was a big step for me. The date went really well—he’s such a nice guy. Gentleman, caring, may sense kausap, and he has substance. Alam mo yung parang “too good to be true” na guys? That’s how I felt about him. He seemed so genuine, the type na mabait talaga, hindi nagbabait-baitan lang.  

Our first date was simple: meal, coffee, and kwentuhan. Nothing else. Super wholesome, walang halong eme. After that, we continued talking and updating each other about our daily lives. Both of us were busy at that time, studying and reviewing for our respective exams. Fast forward to February 2024, I started feeling unsure if I was ready for a commitment, and honestly, nababagalan din ako sa progress namin. I think he felt the same, kasi parang focused din siya sa goals niya. Eventually, we stopped talking.  

Then this December 2024, he reached out again. Nagkamustahan kami, and we realized it’s been a year since we first met. We decided to meet again for a second date, despite both of us being busy. I’m already working now, and he’s still reviewing for his board exam.  

Here’s what surprised me: I’m the type of person who loves going to church, and he even sent me a mass schedule, asking which one matched mine. So for our second date, we went to church, had dinner, and roadtrip. It was such a thoughtful, perfect date—super gentleman vibes talaga.  

But here’s the thing: I didn’t feel that *kilig*. Yung tipong kilig na romantic, wala. I did feel something like “aww, ang sweet naman niya,” pero hindi yung butterflies-in-my-stomach feeling. I’m starting to wonder if it’s just me. Siguro nasanay ako sa chaotic relationships in the past, and now that this guy is calm and steady, parang di ko alam paano i-process.  

Also, he’s never given me any vibe na may hidden agenda or anything. Sobrang pure niya. But now, I’m overthinking—does he see me in a romantic way? Or is he just naturally this kind and nice? For example, during our date, he mentioned na malamig yung kamay niya and asked me to hold it. Is that a subtle move? First move ba yun? Or wala lang yun for him?  

I’m torn. Is it me who’s not ready for this calmness? Or is he just not romantically interested? Thoughts?

I've dealt with frantic campers, missing hikers, and even a bear or two.

The work was never boring, but it wasn't always glamorous either. Verifying trails, answering calls, and assuring guests that the squirrels weren't rabid and that the park maps were accurate if you could read them were all part of a routine. I had developed a deep affection for the smell of the trees, the nighttime cricket chirp, and the way the stars appeared to be much closer. I didn't object when the superiors informed me that I would be relocating to the fire watch tower on Raven's Crest. Sincerely, I was anticipating the solitude. The tower sat perched on the edge of a rocky outcrop, high above the valley. 

From the small wraparound deck, I could see almost the entire park, a patchwork of evergreen forests, meandering streams, and rugged cliffs. There were caves down in the valley, their dark mouths barely visible from the tower. They’d been off-limits for decades, the official reasoning being “unstable rock formations.” It was the kind of bureaucratic phrasing that didn’t invite questions, and I’d never had a reason to give them much thought. My job didn’t include spelunking. My first week on the post was quiet, peaceful even. Mornings began with coffee brewed on a small propane stove. 

The scent of pine filtered through the open windows as I sat at the desk, logging observations into the station’s weathered notebook. Afternoons, I’d settle into the worn chair by the tall windows, scanning the horizon with binoculars for smoke or anything unusual. Evenings were serene, the sky streaked with hues of orange and purple as the sun dipped below the horizon. Nights, I’d fall asleep to the soft hum of the radio, the occasional static-laden message from other towers breaking the silence. By the fifth day, I’d fallen into a comfortable routine. It was the kind of quiet you could sink into, the kind that makes you feel like the world has slowed down just for you. That morning, I brewed my coffee as usual and stepped onto the deck to take in the view. The valley stretched out before me, shrouded in a gentle mist that clung to the treetops. The air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of damp earth. It was perfect

“Ethan, you there?” 

Leah’s voice crackled through the static-laden radio, slicing through the late-afternoon stillness that had settled over the watchtower like a heavy blanket.I straightened in my chair, pulling the mic closer. 

“Here. What’s up?”

“There’s smoke down in the valley,” 

she said, her voice tinged with a mix of urgency and fatigue.

 “Northeast side, near the old mining trail. It’s faint, but it’s there.”

I stood and peered out the tower’s wide windows, scanning the treetops and ridges. The sun hung low in the sky, casting long, golden rays over the endless expanse of green. My eyes caught nothing unusual, but Leah’s reports were rarely wrong

.“Think you can check it out?”

 she asked, her voice crackling again before cutting back to clarity.

“On it,” 

I replied without hesitation.I grabbed my weathered field bag from its hook near the door, stuffing in a few essentials: a canteen of water, my notebook, and the compact first-aid kit I never left behind. As I swung the bag over my shoulder, I took a final glance around the tower, making sure everything was in order. The radio crackled faintly in the background, a constant companion in these isolated stretches of wilderness.Locking up the door behind me, I descended the narrow metal stairs with practiced ease. The tower creaked softly as the wind picked up, rustling the trees below. At the base, my Wrangler waited, dusted with a fine coat of pollen and dirt from countless trips into the forest.I threw my bag into the passenger seat and climbed in, pausing for a moment to let the familiar hum of the engine settle into my chest as I turned the key. 

The vehicle rumbled to life, the sound resonating in the otherwise silent woods.The drive to the valley wasn’t long—twenty minutes at most—but the deeper I ventured into the trees, the quieter the world became. Gone were the distant chirps of birds and the faint rustle of leaves that usually accompanied me. Even the wind seemed to hold its breath.The Wrangler’s tires crunched over the gravel as I navigated the last stretch of road leading into the camp. 

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm amber glow over the valley. The light felt distant somehow, as though the world had slowed just a bit, suspended in an uneasy calm. As I approached, I could see the small cluster of tents and equipment set up in the clearing ahead, a familiar sight—yet something was wrong.I stopped the truck and cut the engine, the sudden silence that followed feeling unnatural. My heart skipped a beat in the quiet. The world felt almost too still. My eyes scanned the camp as I stepped out, the door slamming softly behind me, a sharp contrast to the heavy silence that surrounded the area. The air, once fresh with the scent of pine, now carried a faint, acrid smell that stung my nostrils. The camp was still, too still, with no sign of life—no movement, no voices. Just an unsettling void of activity.I took a few cautious steps toward the center of the clearing, my boots crunching the dry ground beneath me. The scene that unfolded before me wasn’t just one of abandonment—it was chaos.

Tents were ripped open, their sides torn and flapping in the wind like a flag of distress, fluttering in the cold, late-afternoon breeze. Gear was scattered across the ground—backpacks torn open, sleeping bags shredded, and personal items strewn everywhere as though someone had been in a frantic rush. A half-finished meal sat cold on a makeshift table, forgotten, with a few scattered plates and utensils tossed carelessly aside, the remnants of something once normal, now left to rot. My stomach churned uneasily. This wasn’t a typical case of abandonment or a messy retreat. This was something else—something deliberate. A warning.I crouched down beside one of the torn tents, my hand brushing the frayed edges of the fabric. The material was old, worn by the elements, but the slashes that marred its surface were recent—too fresh. There was a faint, musty smell of mildew, but beneath it, something else. Something heavier. The ground beneath me was disturbed, as though something—or someone—had been dragged through. Deep gouges marred the earth where heavy objects had been pulled, or maybe bodies. I didn’t want to think about it.I rose slowly, scanning the area for any other signs of what might’ve happened. No bodies. No blood. No obvious signs of struggle—just this... wreckage. 

The camp had been torn apart, left in shambles. As if something—or someone—had come through and destroyed it, and whoever had been here before me was gone. There was no sign of any rangers or patrol members. It was as though they’d vanished without a trace. My breath quickened, and an icy knot tightened in my stomach. My fingers went to the radio at my belt, moving almost instinctively. I brought it to my mouth, keeping my voice steady. 

“Leah, this is Ethan. I’ve arrived at the camp. It’s abandoned… and it’s been torn apart.”

There was a brief moment of crackling static before Leah’s voice broke through, sharp and clear.

 “What do you mean, torn apart? Are there signs of a struggle? Did you find anyone?”

“I don’t know,” 

I muttered, my eyes darting from one torn tent to the next.

 “It’s like they left in a hurry. There’s no blood, no signs of violence—just chaos. Something’s not right here. It’s almost as if they were trying to get out fast… but there’s no clear reason why.”

“Stay sharp, Ethan. I’m pulling up the coordinates now and looking at the satellite feed. Check the perimeter and see if you can find anything else. Don’t take any chances.”

“Copy that,”

 I replied, though the unease gnawing at me was hard to shake. Something felt wrong—far more than just the wrecked camp. I had an instinct I couldn’t quite place, a gut feeling telling me to be careful, to keep my eyes wide open.I started walking, my boots crunching the dry earth beneath me as I moved around the perimeter of the camp, eyes scanning every corner. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me, something hidden just beyond the edges of the clearing. It was a low, unsettling sensation, like the forest itself was holding its breath.And then, I saw it.Strange, uneven tracks—deep, ragged indentations in the dirt—leading away from the clearing. They weren’t animal tracks. These were too large, too erratic, as though something—or someone—had been dragged through the dirt.

 The tracks didn’t go far before they disappeared into the thickening forest, winding toward the old mining trail I’d passed earlier on my way in.I hesitated, my pulse quickening. The tracks were fresh, the soil still disturbed, the earth untouched by the usual wear of time. Whoever or whatever had been here hadn’t been gone long.

“Leah,”

I said, my voice low, as if speaking louder would shatter the silence around me. 

“I’m following a trail. Something—or someone—was dragged through here. They’re heading toward the old mining trail. I’m going in.”

“Be careful, Ethan,” 

Leah’s voice crackled back, a note of concern undercutting the usual professionalism. 

“Call if you need backup.”

I didn’t respond immediately. My gaze was already fixed on the dark line of trees ahead, the track disappearing into the shadows of the forest. The forest felt different now—less welcoming. The quiet, the weight of the stillness, made everything feel more... urgent. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, a creeping awareness that something wasn’t right.And with that, I turned, stepping carefully into the forest, the faintest sensation of being watched crawling over my skin. Something was out there, and I was about to find out exactly what.I hesitated only a moment longer before pushing forward. My boots crunched softly on the forest floor, each step carrying me deeper into the trees. The uneven tracks led me through dense underbrush, past twisted, gnarled roots that seemed to reach out like skeletal hands. The air was cooler here, the kind of crisp chill that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 

A subtle tension thickened the silence as I moved farther from the camp, and the atmosphere felt oppressive, as if the forest itself was waiting for something, or someone, to make the next move.The trail had become clearer, the disturbed earth more pronounced. The footprints—if they could even be called that—looked unnatural, as though something heavy had been dragged through the woods, leaving a trail of broken branches and crushed leaves in its wake. Yet, there was no sign of blood or struggle. Just... absence. A feeling that grew stronger with each step, gnawing at me, clawing at the edges of my mind. Something was very wrong here.Minutes later, the trees began to thin, their towering trunks making way for a small, rocky clearing. 

And there, in the center of it all, was a cave entrance. I stopped dead in my tracks, the hairs on the back of my neck prickling. The cave’s mouth yawned open, dark and foreboding, but it wasn’t just the cavern that drew my attention—it was the broken chain lying on the ground just in front of it.The chain was thick and rusted with age but clearly once strong, the links large enough to hold something—or someone—secure. Now it lay twisted and broken in the dirt, as if snapped with ease, the metal scattered in jagged pieces around the entrance. Nearby, the remnants of a rusted fence lay crumpled and bent, one of the posts completely uprooted, the others bent inward, as though something had forcefully breached the barrier. It wasn’t the work of nature. This was too deliberate, too controlled. Someone—or something—had come through here, and recently.I swallowed hard, unease crawling up my spine. The silence around me felt heavier, more stifling. I stepped closer, the crunch of my boots on the gravel the only sound, as I inspected the broken chain. The metal was twisted in a way that suggested brute force, but also something oddly methodical, like the work of someone who knew exactly what they were doing. Whoever—or whatever—had done this wasn’t reckless. They were purposeful.

The air seeping from the cave was cool, with a faint metallic, stale tang, as if sealed for years. I could almost taste its bitterness, drying my throat. Outside, the wreckage—broken chains and a bent fence—suggested an escape, not random destruction. What had been locked away here? And why?Foreboding gripped me, but curiosity pushed me forward. With a deep breath, I clicked on my flashlight, the beam flickering as I ducked under the jagged overhang. The cave smelled of damp earth, decay, and something ancient. A chill ran down my spine, but I pressed on.

The tunnel inside was narrow, winding, and the stone walls seemed to close in on me with each step I took. The faint remnants of old graffiti were scrawled along the jagged walls—hasty marks, symbols I couldn’t make sense of. There was a sense of abandonment here, but it wasn’t the kind of quiet you’d find in a forgotten place. No, this felt like a place that had been sealed off for a reason, and it had been waiting—waiting for someone, or something, to come back.

The deeper I went, the colder the air became. My breath misted in front of me, and the metallic scent grew stronger, thickening with each step I took. The path twisted and turned, and soon I could no longer see the entrance behind me. Only the narrow beam of my flashlight illuminated the path ahead, the stone walls closing in as the tunnel narrowed even more. The echo of my footsteps was the only sound, a rhythmic thudding that bounced off the walls and only served to amplify the isolation.I paused briefly, my hand instinctively tightening around the flashlight. I listened, but all I could hear was the soft echo of my breath, the distant, eerie drip of water somewhere deeper within the cave. 

The stillness was suffocating, and my mind raced. How much farther was I going to go? Was I really prepared to walk into whatever lay ahead?I took another cautious step forward, my pulse quickening, my senses sharpening. And then, ahead, I saw it—a faint reflection in the low light of my flashlight. Something metallic.The path opened up into a large chamber, its high ceilings lost in the shadows above. The faint glow of my light bounced off something rusted and heavy, an imposing structure standing in the center of the room. A large, iron gate. The edges of the gate were covered in cobwebs, thick and heavy, the dust of years—or decades—settled on every surface. But what caught my eye wasn’t the gate itself—it was the chains that wrapped around it, still thick and intact. Heavy, industrial chains, gleaming faintly under the weak light.A chill ran down my spine. 

This wasn’t just an old cave—it felt like a prison. Something had been kept here, something meant to stay hidden away. The chains, the gate—it all pointed to something dark, something locked away for a reason.My eyes scanned the room, my breath catching in my throat as I noticed the strange, uneven markings on the walls. They weren’t graffiti this time. They were... symbols, older, more unsettling. Some were crudely drawn, others faded, as if time had gnawed away at them.I took a step closer, my eyes fixed on the rusted gate. I needed to know what was behind it, but the closer I got, the more uneasy I became. Something in the air felt heavier now. The silence around me deepened, and I could feel a shift, an energy, like something ancient was waking, something that had been locked away for too long.Before I could move closer, a distant, unsettling noise echoed through the chamber—a soft scraping sound, like metal against stone.My heart skipped a beat, and I froze.I froze, the beam of my flashlight trembling in my hand as the scraping sound continued, echoing ominously off the cavern’s jagged walls. My heartbeat pulsed in my ears, drowning out everything else. 

For a fleeting moment, I wondered if it was just the wind—perhaps a draft moving through some hidden crevice, dragging loose stones across the ground. But no. This was deliberate. A slow, rhythmic scrape that almost sounded… purposeful.The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as my breath hitched in my chest. 

“Hello?”

 I called out, my voice barely rising above the oppressive silence of the cave. The words felt fragile, as if they might break the moment they left my mouth, swallowed by the cavern’s vast emptiness.For a long stretch, nothing answered.Then, from deeper within the shadows of the cavern, came a faint voice—a whisper so soft and fragile that it almost didn’t seem real.

“Help... please... help me…”

The words sent a chill down my spine. I felt my throat tighten as I stepped forward, compelled by a force I couldn’t understand, but my legs felt leaden, weighed down by an unsettling instinct that screamed at me to turn around, to leave. But the voice—it was so desperate, so human, it dragged me forward despite everything.I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breathing as my flashlight beam danced erratically over the walls. 

“Who’s there?”

 I called, my voice trying, desperately, to hold onto some semblance of calm. But the tremor in it betrayed my unease, and I hated myself for it. I had to stay focused.The voice came again, softer this time but unmistakably the same: 

“Please… help me…”

I stopped, my heart hammering against my ribs. It sounded so real. So human. But there was something else. Something off about it—like it had been trapped down here for far too long. Too fragile, too familiar, but somehow wrong. The hairs on my neck stood on end.

“Where are you?”

 I called out, straining my eyes in the dim light, my flashlight darting over the shadows. 

“Where are you? Can you hear me?”

“Help… please... help me…” 

The voice repeated, identical in tone and cadence. No variation. The same desperation.A cold dread crawled down my spine. My mind screamed that this was no ordinary plea. It was a mimicry, an echo of something that had been down here far too long. Maybe it wasn’t even human.A sudden, chilling realization made my breath catch in my throat. This wasn’t a person. This was something else—something that had learned to imitate a voice, to play on the most basic, primal urge to help someone in need. 

But why? And what was it waiting for in the shadows?I took a slow step back, my instincts screaming at me to leave, to get out of this cursed cave. But before I could turn, the voice came again, louder this time, more urgent. And yet, it was still the same. Too identical. Too rehearsed.

“Please… help me…” 

The words echoed like a chant now, insistent, growing in intensity. But there was no desperation left in it—just an unshakable, dissonant repetition.I could feel my pulse in my throat, the panic rising in my chest as I spun on my heel. I turned toward the tunnel entrance, my flashlight wavering in my grasp. Something wasn’t right. Suddenly, the ground trembled beneath my feet, a deep, guttural rumble vibrating the very walls of the cave. I froze, my heart skipping a beat as a cold sweat trickled down my back. The noise wasn’t just from the scraping anymore—it was something else. Something… alive. 

Something huge.My stomach turned over as the rumble grew louder, closer. It was unmistakable now: something was moving behind me. Something with mass. Something unnatural.I didn’t hesitate. My legs propelling me forward, I pushed myself into a sprint, the darkness of the cave pressing in around me like a suffocating force. My boots slipped against the jagged floor, and I barely managed to keep my balance as I darted down the narrow tunnel. The scraping sound intensified, merging with the ominous, rhythmic thudding that grew steadily louder behind me.It was following me.The noise of it—a slow, deliberate stomp—was gaining ground with terrifying speed. 

I could hear the earth rumbling beneath me as if it were a giant, something massive chasing after me, the air thickening with each pulse. My breath came in quick gasps as I pushed myself harder, faster, the tunnel seeming to stretch on endlessly, the light from my flashlight casting erratic, dancing shadows on the walls that only deepened the sense of imminent danger.Whatever it was, it was close.I stumbled over an uneven patch of rock, my ankle twisting painfully, but I didn’t slow down.

 I couldn’t afford to. Every instinct screamed at me to get out, to run as if my life depended on it—because it did.The heavy pounding of footsteps reverberated behind me, sending shockwaves of terror through my veins. I was almost there—I could see the faint glimmer of light ahead, the entrance, the open air just beyond the cave’s grasp.I wasn’t going to make it.The thundering noise was deafening now, each step of whatever creature was chasing me like a massive shockwave against the stone walls. It was closing in, so close I could feel the weight of it pressing down on me.

 My heart thudded so loudly in my chest that I couldn’t hear anything but that pulse, like a countdown to my end.Finally, the mouth of the cave came into view. The dim light from the outside world filtered in, offering the smallest sliver of hope. My legs burned, my lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.I reached the broken fence, my hands trembling as I fumbled for the lock. My pulse hammered in my throat, and I could feel the presence of something—something monstrous—just behind me, right on my heels. The air was thick with a suffocating pressure, and I was sure that if I didn’t get the gate locked, whatever was chasing me would tear me apart.

Click.

The lock turned, but my hands shook too violently, my fingers slipping against the cold, rusted metal. The rumble from behind me was growing louder—louder—and I could hear something breathing, something heavy, strained, and primal.

Click!

The lock slid into place just as I slammed the gate shut with everything I had. My heart pounded in my chest as I stumbled backward, panting for air. But I didn’t waste a second. I turned and ran.I didn’t dare look back.The Wrangler was still parked where I left it, the engine idling softly in the quiet dusk, but I didn’t stop to appreciate it. I barely registered the familiar sight of the truck as I sprinted toward it, my legs weak, my entire body screaming in exhaustion. My hands fumbled with the door, and I threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.The noise was still there—the sound of something huge, powerful, and relentless, still somewhere within the cave. 

It hadn’t shown itself, hadn’t fully revealed its shape, but I knew it was there, lurking in the shadows. It hadn’t followed me outside. It had stayed behind, but that didn’t make it any less real.With a final surge of desperation, I slammed the door shut, cranked the engine, and slammed my foot down on the gas pedal. The Wrangler roared to life, the tires screeching against the gravel as I tore out of the clearing, not looking back. My heart hammered in my chest, the adrenaline coursing through my veins as the truck kicked up dust and gravel.

The engine of the Wrangler roared to life as I slammed my foot on the gas, the tires screeching as I tore out of the clearing. My heart raced, a frenzied thump in my chest, but as I sped down the rough trail, I forced myself to focus on the road ahead. I couldn’t afford to look back. I couldn’t afford to lose control now.White-knuckled on the wheel, cold sweat soaking my shirt, I pushed the Wrangler through the winding forest trail. 

Trees blurred past, gravel flew under the tires, and the truck shook with every bump, but I couldn’t ease off the gas. Something had been chasing me—its footsteps close, the earth trembling beneath my feet. Though the rearview mirror showed only the empty road, I couldn’t shake the fear it was still behind me. The cave lingered in my mind: dark, foreboding, broken chains. 

I had escaped, but why? The doubt gnawed at me. Was it waiting for a mistake? I pressed harder on the gas, desperate to reach the watchtower. As the trees thinned, the clearing came into view. It felt impossibly far, every second an eternity. 

Finally, I reached the tower, slammed the brakes, and jumped out. My legs were shaky as I stumbled to the locked door, heart pounding. Even in the stillness, I couldn’t escape the sense that something was watching, waiting.

I forced myself to push through the door and into the tower, the familiar surroundings offering little comfort now. The radio sat on the desk in front of me, its screen dark. The silence of the tower wrapped around me like a shroud, and for the first time, it felt suffocating.I shut the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to slow my breathing. 

The place that had once been a sanctuary now felt like a cage. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the creature—whatever it was—was still out there, waiting. But it hadn’t followed me. It hadn’t chased me beyond the cave.I couldn’t let myself feel safe—I knew I hadn’t outrun it. It was still out there, lurking in the shadows. I walked to the window, staring into the black forest. The trees stood silent, motionless against the starless sky. The quiet was suffocating, pressing in on me. I turned to the radio, my fingers hovering over the mic, but what could I say? Would Leah believe me? The voice, the chains, the scraping—what kind of monster had I encountered?I locked the door behind me, the click echoing with eerie finality. It felt absurd, knowing a lock wouldn’t keep it out, but I needed to feel some semblance of safety. 

Climbing the stairs to the watchtower’s small living quarters, the stifling air and oppressive silence followed me.Sitting on the bed, I ran trembling hands through my hair, trying to calm my racing mind. The cave—the darkness, the chains, the sounds—kept replaying in my head. It felt like a nightmare I couldn’t escape, the weight of it crushing me.

I glanced toward the radio again, then turned away. I wanted to call Leah. I wanted to tell her everything, but I didn’t know how. What could I say? I was terrified, and yet nothing had followed me back. There were no signs of the creature. 

The woods were as still as they always were. But that didn’t ease the unease gnawing at my gut.I pulled the covers up, though I wasn’t cold. The air felt heavy with dread, making every breath feel too thick, too slow. I rolled onto my side, staring out the window, trying to focus on the trees in the distance. The view from the tower had always been calming before, the peaceful stretch of forest rolling out beneath the darkening sky, the distant outline of the mountains beyond.

But tonight, the sight was anything but peaceful. It was a reminder of what lurked beyond the trees. What had been waiting for me in that cave. I clenched my fists, squeezing my eyes shut, trying to force the thoughts away, but they wouldn’t leave. They were like a constant whisper, gnawing at the edges of my mind.

A sudden noise broke my thoughts—soft at first, like a faint rustling. I snapped my head toward the window, my heart pounding again. Was it the wind? A trick of the trees? No. It was a voice. 

A faint, unmistakable sound that seemed to drift toward me through the still night air.I froze. It wasn’t just any voice.

“Ethan…”

It was my mom’s voice. Clear and gentle, like she was standing right outside, calling me. My breath caught in my throat. I sat up straight in bed, my eyes wide, straining to hear more. The sound of my name echoed again, only this time, it was softer, more like a whisper.

“Ethan… help me…”

I scrambled to my feet, heart racing. It couldn’t be her. I hadn’t heard from her in months—there was no reason for her to be here. I rushed to the window, peering into the still, dark forest. No movement, no shadow, nothing but silence.Had I imagined it? Her voice saying my name had sounded so real, so unmistakable. I tried to shake it off as stress, but then I heard it again—a different voice. My sister’s.

“Ethan… help us…”

I spun around, heart pounding, and rushed back to the window. My eyes darted through the empty forest, but there was nothing. They couldn’t be out there. It wasn’t possible.

“Ethan…”

 My mother’s voice again, closer now, just below the window. My hands gripped the sill, trembling. This isn’t real. It’s not real.I stepped back from the window, my breaths coming faster now. I shook my head again, my thoughts spiraling. Was I losing my mind? Was it the stress, the fear, the exhaustion?But the voices kept coming. Over and over again, like a loop—soft whispers that felt like they were right on the other side of the walls. I couldn’t block them out.

“Ethan, we’re here. Come outside. Please.

”They sounded desperate now, pleading.I pressed my hands to my ears, trying to block out the voices, but they were relentless, their words seeping into my mind, their tone familiar and comforting. It was as though they were really out there, like they were just waiting for me to open the door, to step outside and follow their calls. They were so close.I rushed toward the door, my hand shaking as I gripped the handle. I couldn’t explain it. My heart ached, my throat tight. I wanted to see them. 

I wanted to make sure they were all right.But as I opened the door, the cool night air hit me, and the voices stopped. Gone.There was nothing.I stood on the threshold, breathing hard, looking out into the pitch-black emptiness. The same emptiness that had been there moments before. The wind stirred the trees gently, but there was no sign of anyone. 

No trace of them. Not even a footprint in the dirt.

A cold chill swept through me. My throat tightened, and I closed the door quickly, locking it behind me. My mind was spinning. I couldn’t make sense of it. What had just happened?The silence in the tower felt deafening now. No more voices. No more whispers. Just the hum of my own breath, ragged and uncertain.

I staggered back from the door, my mind reeling from the eerie silence that followed the voices. My pulse was racing, the fear crawling under my skin like a thousand insects, buzzing and scratching. My hands were clammy, slick with sweat as I leaned against the wall, trying to steady my breath. It wasn’t possible. None of it made sense. How could I hear their voices? I hadn't seen my mother or sister in years. They couldn't be here. They couldn’t be out there.

My legs gave out beneath me, and I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling uncontrollably. My chest felt tight, as if something were squeezing the air from my lungs. 

My vision blurred, and I tried to focus, to make sense of everything, but the room spun around me.The voices had stopped. But the feeling of being watched remained, like a constant pressure on my chest, suffocating and unyielding.I took shallow breaths, trying to ground myself, but it wasn’t enough. 

The fear, the exhaustion, the overwhelming sense of dread—everything caught up with me all at once. My eyelids fluttered, heavy, and despite my best efforts to fight it, my body betrayed me. My last thought before everything went black was a quiet whisper, the memory of my mother’s voice still echoing faintly in my mind: 

""Help us...""

When I woke, the tower was still silent, the morning light creeping through the small window, casting a pale glow across the floor. 

I sat up quickly, the remnants of the dream—or whatever it was—lingering like a fog in my mind. My head was pounding, my body stiff from the cold. My throat was dry, and a dull ache settled deep in my bones.I glanced around the room, still disoriented, trying to shake off the remnants of the nightmare. It had felt so real. But the tower was quiet. Still. Empty.

I had to focus. I had to do something. I couldn’t stay here anymore. The weight of the night’s events hung on me like an anchor.I staggered to my feet, swaying slightly as I moved to the small desk by the window. The radio was there, silent and cold, waiting for me. 

My hands were still trembling, but I reached for it anyway. My fingers felt numb as I grabbed the mic, pressing it to my lips with a desperation I couldn’t hide.

“Leah…” 

My voice cracked, hoarse from the fear and exhaustion. I cleared my throat and tried again.

 “Leah, this is Ethan. I need to call for search and rescue.”

There was a brief pause on the other end, the static crackling in response. Then Leah’s voice, sharp and professional, came through the speaker.

“Ethan? What’s going on? You sound—what happened?”

I closed my eyes, trying to gather my thoughts, trying to piece together the events of the last few hours. The fear and confusion were still too fresh, still too real. My pulse quickened, but I had to explain. I had to get help.

“I… I can’t explain it, Leah. I don’t know what happened, but I need help. There’s something out there. Something in the cave. The camp—there was no one there. Just destruction. And the voices, Leah… I heard them. I heard my mom and my sister. They called to me. But they’re not here. They can’t be. I don’t know what’s going on, but I need—” 

My words faltered as the weight of everything crashed down on me again. I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breath.Leah’s voice broke the tension, calm but firm. 

“Ethan, just breathe. I’m pulling up your coordinates. Stay in the tower. Search and rescue are on their way.”

I clutched the mic, my hands shaking. 

“Okay… Please, hurry.”

After a pause, her voice returned, more reassuring. 

“We’re on our way, Ethan. You’re not alone.”

I set the mic down, my legs weak as I sank onto the bed. Dawn’s first light filtered through the trees, bringing a faint sense of relief. Help was coming, but the fear clung to me, the cave and voices replaying in my mind. Something still felt off—like I was being watched.I leaned back against the cold wall, closing my eyes, and waited. 

The morning air outside was heavy with anticipation, the horizon stretching wide and silent.Leah had arrived with the search and rescue team a few hours after our conversation. They’d come prepared, their vehicles parked in a loose formation just beyond the tower. The crew was methodical, focused, but I couldn’t shake the lingering dread that followed me like a shadow. Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and I couldn’t explain it. 

But they were here now, and they trusted me to lead them to the cave.I felt the weight of the team’s eyes on me as I gathered my gear. There were six of us—Leah, a few experienced rescuers, and me. Everyone knew their role, but my role felt… heavier than I’d expected. I wasn’t just leading them to a location; I was leading them into a nightmare I barely understood myself.

""Ready?""

 Leah asked, her voice steady but with a hint of concern as she caught my eye.

""Yeah. Let's go,""

 I replied, trying to mask the tremor in my voice.I led the way back through the forest, my senses sharp but on edge. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their shadows deep and dark. The path was familiar, but it felt different now, darker, heavier with each step. I hadn’t wanted to come back here, but there was no choice. The voices, the wrecked camp, the thing in the cave—it was all too real. And now, I had to face it. As we approached the clearing, I felt my stomach drop. The area around the cave felt untouched, the fence I’d hurriedly locked still in place, but something was off. 

The lock—the lock—was gone. 

I stopped dead in my tracks, my breath catching in my throat.

""What's wrong?""

 Leah’s voice cut through the tension, her brow furrowing as she caught up to me. She followed my gaze, her eyes narrowing as she saw the state of the broken chain, now completely gone.I swallowed, fear crawling up my spine.

 “I… I locked it. I swear I locked it.”

But there was no time to dwell on that. The team began to fan out, checking the perimeter, while Leah and I approached the cave entrance. The darkness seemed to swallow the light from our flashlights, and a strange heaviness pressed down on me as I stepped closer.

""Stay sharp,""

 Leah ordered, her voice low and serious. 

""We don’t know what we're dealing with here.""

The team moved silently, their footsteps muffled by the dense undergrowth. The smell of decay and old earth hit me again, stronger this time. I could feel the weight of the past hours hanging over me, the dread gnawing at my gut. I looked at the entrance of the cave, the jagged rocks surrounding it like the mouth of a beast ready to swallow us whole.

We moved inside, the air growing colder with each step. The flashlight beams caught the same graffiti on the walls, now faded and distant, the memories of whoever had been here long before us. The floor was still damp and uneven, the strange metallic smell in the air even stronger now. 

And then, we found them.The first body was lying in the middle of the cavern floor, an unsettling stillness surrounding it. The other two were scattered nearby. The bodies were lifeless, pale, and cold to the touch, but there was something more disturbing about them. They weren’t just dead. They had been… moved. Torn apart in places, their limbs twisted unnaturally, their clothes shredded.And then we saw the fourth body.

It was a few feet from the others. The head had been removed—sliced off cleanly, as if with a blade. No blood spilled. Just… clean. The body itself was intact, lying unnaturally still, but the severed head wasn’t anywhere to be found.A chill ran down my spine, and I had to fight the urge to turn and run. This wasn’t just some animal attack or a botched camp. This was something deliberate. Someone—or something—had done this.I forced myself to breathe, trying to calm my racing pulse. 

""These were the camp’s occupants,"" 

I said, my voice barely a whisper.

 ""They… they were here. Something killed them. But—"" 

I stopped, my throat tightening. 

""Who did this? What did this?""

Leah knelt beside the headless body, her expression unreadable. 

“We’ll need to call for an extraction. This is beyond us.”

The team documented the scene, but my mind reeled. The voices mimicking my loved ones felt like a distant dream, yet I couldn’t shake their reality. Hours in the cave yielded no answers—no struggle, no weapons, no tracks. The remains were methodically placed, chilling in their grotesque stillness.

The culprit was never found, the investigation closed without explanation. The voices stopped, and the creature remained hidden, as though it had always been there, waiting. Even after ten years, I can’t escape the feeling of being watched.

I still patrol the woods, climb the tower, and try to forget. But some nights, when the wind howls just right, I hear whispers—faint, familiar, but never anyone I know. I’ve never seen it again, yet I know it’s still out there, lurking in the dark, waiting for the next unwary soul.

Sometimes, alone in the tower, the voices return, soft and low, just beyond the wind. But no one’s ever there.",1,1735043128.0,nosleep,0,0.66,False
