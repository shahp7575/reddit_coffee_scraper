Yeah, totally. Because what really elevates my lukewarm baguette is the shared sense of purpose radiating from two employees who 1) probably don’t even know what Pret is, and 2) definitely don’t give a single f**k about “making every sip magical”.

It’s honestly wild how every big company trots out the same “our people are our greatest asset” nonsense. No, the secret ingredient is logistics and cost efficiency, not your average Gary who’s just trying to make rent at 6am at a random airport in a random country.

I can’t stand this corporate theatre, the illusion of warmth at industrial scale. These slogans exist because there’s no real connection left. “Our people make the magic happen” is code for “we automated empathy and outsourced the rest.” It’s not about people… it’s about branding that humanizes a supply chain

Unbeknownst to me I left my computer on with the essay up.

It was essentially about my childhood and my mom's obsession with status. She got home and being the nosey person she is read it. I was out at the bar that night with some friends when I get a long text telling me not to come home and that she's so sorry for failing me etc.

I have an anxiety attack and tried to hurt myself badly and ended up in the hospital. Felt like my life was ending. The psych ward did me food though. Got me on medication --- gave me space to think. I got out to find my mom going insane driving around town trying to find my car bc she didn't believe I went to the hospital and thought I killed myself. I texted her I was checking myself in that night (but left out that I did get hurting myself). She went through all of my discord messages for the last month and trashed my room. My dad blocked her promptly so she stormed over and tried beating down his door.

I took a week, texted her to meet and arrived at a diner sitting in a chintzy booth with the smell of far too dark coffee filling the air. We spoke for a while about me moving In with my dad and the things I said about her, but I stood my ground and said none of it was for her eyes and that she crossed my boundaries. Its read at your own risk material, my messages and my essay. She retorted calling me some terribly nasty things saying I'm bitter and cruel, no wonder I don't keep friends long, but she's so wrong. I just have standards I hold my friends to.

Anyways, I'm moved in with my dad now, feeling proud of my accomplishment although a bit hollow too",2,1759637130.0,Codependency,1,1.0,False

He goes to church ceremony hours away whenever a meeting is called. He told me weeks ago he had ceremony October 11…. 

Okay that’s fine. I told him I wanted to make plans for myself and my son to go see my aunt on the opposite side of the state that weekend. Since he will be gone. He said we could talk about it later since it’s weeks away.. I am kinda hurt that in his only upcoming days off he’s wanting to spend it going to church ceremony he know the rest of us aren’t involved in… but whatever. 

Well, last time he went to ceremony I stayed home and watched his daughter in his weekend. I did offer this btw. (3 from his previous relationship)… I knew October 11 was his weekend with step daughter. So I waited to figure out those plans when the weekend came up sooner… 

My husband has been working 12 hour days/6 days a week the past 2 month (almost)… today was day 14 of a work stretch…. No day off for him. we haven’t done much together as a family in this time. We also have a big piece of property we live on that is requiring winter prep… I have been doing all house chores in top of kids , meals, practices, games, on top of working FT myself. Along with the homesteading we do, canning, small farming etc. 

He also picks at everything I do. I make sure his coffee cup is washed every night , and the coffee maker is done. If the lid to the coffee maker is shut all the way to it “snaps” down.. he will pretty much put to the side that I did it at all…. The other night I said “oh I did the coffee maker”, he replied “no you didn’t. The lid wasn’t all the way snapped down”.. like how rude…. If I do a task, and don’t do it the way he thinks I should I’d be will pick at me and say “why did you do it that way”…. 

Tomorrow is Sunday & he’s driving 3 hours away to watch his oldest son bowl. He wanted me to go, but I knew if we both were out of town next weekend then nothing would get done in the property or prepared for next week with our 2 small children. He made snide remarks. I feel like he doesn’t understand that I don’t just sit around and do nothing. There’s stuff that I have to do since he’s been working so much. 

Back to the beginning…. I asked him tonight (October 3) if he was still going out of town next weekend (October 11) to church… he said yes. I told him that’s fine I was just making sure since it’s his weekend w his daughter. I told him i would be going to visit my aunt. With that he immediately got upset saying how I’m going on a time he can’t be included. I feel like if he’s going to ceremony church I don’t wanna just sit at home again? Let alone , offer to keep his daughter again. Sometimes I do feel used because he knows I’ll always offer to help w her… 

He immediately called me some mean names. I told him I wasn’t gonna feel bad to go see my aunt in a weekend he’s going out of town again! I have barely done anything for myself because I wrap my entire life around our family and running this household… 

He’s hurt I “go on a weekend he can’t be included and  skipping out on his son’s bowling tournament tomorrow”…  I’m sorry but I have 2 small children during the week, meal prep and stuff to do around the property that he hasn’t been around to do (not complaining) I can’t just give up my entire Sunday to go to your sons bowling tournament… let alone be gone 2 weekends in a row. He told me that was “my choice” to make plans to see my aunt next weekend…. 

his son and I have little to no relationship. He hasn’t never lived w his dad. I just don’t feel obligated to go honestly. My household comes first , I have to keep it running smoothly during the week while also working FT!.. 

Am I in the wrong for making plans to go see my aunt with my son on a weekend he’s going out of town anyways?… he did invite me to go to church w him next weekend… But all I’d do is sit in a hotel room while he’s not even there… he always throws a fit when soemthing doesn’t go his way. He’s hella OCD too and feels obligated to go to everything he’s invited to and expects me to constantly tag along with him. I barely do anything for myself anymore tbh…. I canned all day today, worked on our property. Made an apple pie, and cookies for him to take to the tournament tomorrow… but nope. I’m horrible now. 

I’m done feeling bad about choosing myself this time.. But he’s throwing a fit right now and put himself to bed “cause he never gets a break and has to wake up early tomorrow to drive to his son’s bowling tournament alone”…. Now he’s gone to bed. Haven’t seen him barely at all in 2 weeks.  I feel like I’m being used as a babysitter, for s*x, and meals right now lol… he’s gonna be out of town tomorrow and next weekend… please send some advice ",1,1759636869.0,married,0,1.0,False

A recurring tension for us is money and gestures — we split almost everything 50/50.

For example, we recently drove out of town for a dance class, and I paid my half; we also split dinner equally, even though he’s 6ft3 and I’m 5ft4 and he eats more than I do.

Yesterday he surprised me with movie tickets. The tickets were $10 each. He didn’t want to buy popcorn at the theatre, so he brought $2 popcorn from the store. I didn’t think he’d want to share, so I bought $4 popcorn from the store to bring — and we ended up eating mine. I genuinely appreciated the surprise; the movie was great.

This morning I asked if we could go for coffee together. At the counter, he asked if I could grab them. I said I didn’t have money on me, and he said, “Okay, will you send me $6 tomorrow for yours?” That made me feel sad, like I wasn’t worth a $6 coffee.

When he asked why it upset me, I explained that small gestures — like treating me sometimes — make me feel cared for. That’s how I was raised and what I value. He said he had just taken me to the movies and that his love shouldn’t be measured by money, because he values fairness and splitting things equally.

This has been a recurring argument for us. I got frustrated and said something hurtful — “So you’ll be 50/50 your whole life, even asking your pregnant wife to split bills?” He said that wasn’t fair or the same, but I still feel uneasy.

My fear is that if he isn’t willing to cover small things now, he might not be willing to take care of me later when life circumstances change (like pregnancy or illness). I associate generosity with love, while he associates equality with respect.

I want marriage in the next couple of years; he says he wants to marry me eventually but won’t put a timeline on it. Our values seem to clash, and it’s making me feel disconnected.

TL;DR: We’re both 23 and have been together a year. We split almost everything, which keeps leading to arguments. He believes love shouldn’t be measured by spending; I feel loved through small gestures. I’m unsure how to communicate my needs without sounding ungrateful.

Looking for advice on:
How can I communicate my feelings about small gestures and generosity in a way that helps us understand each other better without it turning into another fight?",1,1759636807.0,RomanticAdvice,1,1.0,False

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Objectification, controlling behavior, sexism!<

**MOOD SPOILER:** >!Disgusting but ultimately positive!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/4A3wZmwCTI)  **June 25, 2015**

So I knew he was into video games when we started dating. I'm basically the opposite of him in that department; I've never been interested in anything video-game related. That entire ""nerd"" culture is not for me. Mind you, I have made an effort to understand his hobby and over the years I've even found games I enjoy playing, but I would definitely not consider ""gaming"" to be a hobby of mine (I'll play rhythm games like... once a week for a an hour at most for example.) In the beginning of the relationship (first couple years or so) it was pretty difficult getting through to him because he was constantly on WoW. We had to set boundaries later on because I found he wasn't making any time for me and he was constantly on Twitch either watching or streaming himself or playing WoW or LoL or whatever else. It got pretty bad, but we worked through it. 

His obsession with Twitch kind of dwindled down and we were both (seemingly happy.) 

However... 

(And I feel dirty even writing this. I feel worthless and absolutely disgusting and unwanted, please don't judge me too harshly.)

One night before bed, as I was getting ready to lay down, he was watching a stream on his tablet of some famous (?) Twitch female streamer. I happened to glance over, and she was pretty scantily clad, big ""nerd"" glasses, tits hanging out. I thought, whatever. It's just him watching a game. This went on for a few nights in a row, each time it was a different girl. He'd watch for a bit, turn it off, and immediately want to have sex. I've secretly felt like shit over it. But I guess last night kinda broke the camel's back. He set up a stream, started coming on to me in bed, and left his tablet propped up on the night table. I was going along with his advances, but attempted to close the tablet when he told me, *no leave it on, I want to watch her while I do you.*

I was pretty much in shock, didn't know how to respond, started crying and left for the night. He didn't even really attempt to stop me, I got a half-assed sorry as I was leaving. Thankfully my parents live like five minutes away, so I spent the night there. Since I left, he's attempted to call twice and has texted me twice. One text was to tell me I'm overreacting. Am I? How do I approach this? I thought we were over it. I thought we had a decent relationship, but he clearly prefers watching women play video games over just having sex with me. 

Do I approach him or wait for him to approach me? 

TLDR: Boyfriend attempted to initiate sex with me while watching a stream of a female Twitch person, probably because he's turned on by that kind of thing. I feel kind of worthless and gross. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**ttebow**

> You're not worthless or disgusting. What your BF did was extremely disrespectful and you are right to be upset. 
>
> Watching scantily clad girls is one thing, plenty of people like to watch porn or other similar things. What he's doing is basically using your body while he thinks of other people, which is pretty gross. Be firm with your boundaries, if he still brushes it off then you should probably get a better bf.

**OOP**

>> Yeah, which is why I feel like absolute shit. I don't think he realizes this and to me it seems like he sees nothing wrong with what he did. He's accused me of overreacting and has basically said that other guys probably do it, so it's fine. He's hinted at masturbating to this Twitch content before, not even porn. Do men actively masturbate to women playing video games? That seems odd to me. I don't know.
>>
>> I feel used and dirty. 

**~**

**missmissfit**

>What's really crazy is that he didn't even have enough respect to bring it up, like of course my GF won't mind being fucked while I look at another woman on my computer. I think it's pretty obvious that the second he gets one of these female gamers to show a bit of interest in him, he's out the door. 

**Biff_aka_levi**

>>Right? He even said 'I want to watch her while I do you'! Basically, I don't even want to acknowledge that it's *you* that I'm having sex with, I want to pretend it's *her*. The audacity is astounding. He's lucky that crying was the extent of her reactions. 

**trowawufei**

>>>Yeah I'm not sure that OP should hear this... but it seems like for him, this is just a step up from masturbating to Twitch girls. Now he gets to actually have sex, and all his imagination has to do is replace his RL partner with the objects of his infatuations.

**OOP**

>>>>That crossed my mind. I'm okay with hearing it. Like, rationally, I know that's essentially what happened. I guess I shouldn't even say I'm shocked, because I have been pretty sad about the whole relationship for a while but I constantly hoped it would change like he promised so many times. Pretty stupid, eh? 

**senator_mendoza**

>not stupid at all - can't blame you for being positive and optimistic and wanting it to get better. probably time to seriously consider whether you think this is fixable though

**OOP**

>>I've pretty much mulled it over all night, after speaking with him over coffee. His response solidified everything and I'm totally done with the relationship. I'm going to ~~our~~ his place to pick up anything I can fit in my car. Thankfully the lease is up soon anyway, so I just won't be resigning. My parents are more than happy to have me stay for as long as I need to. But I'm already looking into apartments. I've officially resigned from the relationship. 


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BYbRrZDYr7)  **June 26, 2015 (next day)**

Last night I decided to get together for coffee with him, mostly because my mother urged me to. I never told her the extent of what *exactly* happened, but she knows it's video game-related because we've gone over this problem before in the past. Anyway, I initiated the conversation via text and he agreed to meet me. 

I guess I don't know what I was expecting. Closure, maybe? Because I was pretty sure I wanted to end it and stop trying to work things out because I've BEEN working things out for the past five years. It's just become tiring. Anyway, he got into defence mode right away, basically listing all the things *I've* done wrong in the relationship and why *he's* over *me*. These are the things I've done wrong: 

1. I declined going to Korea last year for vacation. He so badly wanted to go. I knew if I went, I'd be left alone every day because his buddy would have come too. Also, there was a big LoL tournament happening at the time so he would've been doing LoL related things and mentally masturbating to the cosplayers all the time while I explored the city alone or hung out in a hotel. I said I wasn't interested in going, he got huffy but eventually got over it (or so I thought.) 

2. I changed my appearance even though I knew he liked women with long brown hair. I decided to cut my hair fairly short and bleach it blond not too long ago. It was time for a change anyway, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. He was not. 

3. I always refused to wear revealing clothing. He'd constantly badger me about how I don't wear enough stuff that shows off my tits and legs. I'm fairly modest, I'm not into that kinda stuff. I'm more comfortable in a t-shirt and jeans. He'd want me to wear sundresses and plunging tank tops, I always said no. 

4.  My birthday gift this year was a pair of those giant wrap-around headphones. Head gear. I don't know what they're called. All the Twitch streamers are wearing them. But he spent a fairly good amount of money on them. Which sounds sweet I guess, but I had originally complained that my old headphones suck, and I need new ones for the gym. He got me these bulky ones and got upset that I don't wear them much. *He's asked me in the past to wear them, put my hair in pigtails and wear revealing clothing around the house while wearing my glasses, I'm not even kidding. This guy is a major stereotype.* 

5. I didn't play LoL and I didn't enjoy sitting on the couch watching him play hours of LoL. I don't how to play the game, I tried numerous times, I suck. I didn't enjoy myself. Why would I keep at it? 

6. And... I was not open-minded about anything. This is pertaining to the situation in the OP. I'm not open minded enough about being his Fleshlight, so this hurt his feelings too. I'm not accepting of his kinks! Which is a total fucking lie because I've agreed to do some pretty ""out there"" stuff in the past to appease him. I'm very open-minded about sex. I would have appreciated a forewarning about the Twitch girl joining us in bed though. 

7. I don't get along with his friends. I tried to, SO HARD. I tried to relate to those guys like you wouldn't believe. But they all literally have zero social skills, they're awkward and blatantly ignored my existence whenever I was around. They'd start talking about things *they're* interested in and just disregard anything I ever said. They'd invite him to board game nights, asking if *I'd be going too* like they don't want me there. I was pretty much an outcast. So no, I tried. They just didn't want to be around me. 

So, in conclusion... I told him I was done. He didn't really react dramatically. I think he's done with the relationship too. He can watch all the Twitch he wants now and play LoL for 23 hours of the day! That must be quite a relief.

I'm going to the apartment to pick up whatever I can later. I'm staying with my parents until I find a new place. 

I feel oddly calm and okay with everything that's gone down in these last couple days. This is almost a relief. 

Thanks everyone. 

TLDR: Broke up with boyfriend. He thinks I'm scum for a number of reasons. I'm okay with it.

1nye7b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nye7b2/which_portable_mug_warmer_model_suits_various/,Which portable mug warmer model suits various needs?,"Hey everyone! I've been using mug warmers for years, and I wanted to share my experience to help those looking for the perfect one. After trying multiple models and doing extensive research, I've found some great options that might interest you.

I remember the frustration of having my coffee go cold while working at my desk. It's such a common problem, right? That's when I discovered these amazing little devices that keep your beverages at the perfect temperature.

For those who work from home or spend long hours at the desk, I highly recommend checking out this particular mug warmer I found (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It's been a game-changer for me, especially during those marathon work sessions.

Let's break down what you should consider when choosing a mug warmer:

1. Temperature Control
Some models offer adjustable settings, while others maintain a fixed temperature. If you're particular about your drink temperature, go for one with adjustable settings.

2. Auto Shut-off Feature
This is crucial for safety. I learned this the hard way when I left my old warmer on overnight!

3. Size and Portability
Consider where you'll use it most. Some are perfect for travel, while others are better suited for desk use.

4. Power Source
USB-powered warmers are super convenient for office use, but they might not heat as effectively as plug-in models.

One thing I've noticed is that ceramic mugs work best with these warmers. They retain heat better than glass or plastic ones.

For those who travel frequently, I'd strongly recommend the model I mentioned earlier (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It's compact, reliable, and has great temperature control.

Pro tips from my experience:
- Preheat your mug warmer before placing your drink
- Use a mug with a flat bottom for better heat transfer
- Clean the heating plate regularly
- Consider getting a warmer with a built-in coaster

I've found that having a good mug warmer has actually helped me reduce waste from reheating drinks in the microwave or making new ones when they get cold.

Price-wise, you don't need to break the bank. The features you need should determine your budget. Most quality warmers range from $20-40, and they're totally worth the investment if you're a regular hot beverage drinker.

Hope this helps you find the perfect mug warmer for your needs! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to share more details about my experience.",1,1759636676.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nye5g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EnvironmentalPlay981/comments/1nye5g6/fake_heiress/,Fake Heiress,"After I was reunited with my birth family, my “sister,” the girl who had taken my place, tearfully offered me he fiancé. “Lily,” she said, her voice a model of selfless understanding, “James is yours. I’ll step aside.” 

The moment she cried, the whole family turned on me with aching hearts and pointed fingers. 

I understood then. This family responded to weakness, not strength. 

So I dropped to my knees with a thud, my sobs louder and more desperate than hers. “Aurora, how can you step aside? If you do, James will blame me, Mom and Dad will blame me, and my brother will blame me! 

What’s the point of me even being alive?” 

I wailed, grabbing a fruit knife from the nearby table. “If you don’t agree to stay with him, I’ll die right here!” 

The entire family froze, their faces a mask of shock. 

Aurora, the fake heiress, was stunned speechless. 

A joke. When it came to crying, I was the undisputed queen. 

In my first week back at the Sterling mansion, I felt like an alien who had crash-landed in someone else’s world. 

And Aurora Sterling, the girl who had lived my life for eighteen years, was the princess of that world. 

One day, a team of workers arrived, carrying ladders and cans of paint. They were going to repaint the entire villa in Aurora’s favorite shade: a soft, buttery cream. 

My room, originally a tasteful off-white, was on their list. 

I stopped the workers, my voice soft. “Could you please not paint my room?” 

Aurora drifted over at the sound of my voice, linking arms with our mother, her eyes already welling up. “Lily, don’t you like it? I’m so sorry, I wasn’t being thoughtful. I just thought you’d like a warm color, too.” 

Our mother’s brow furrowed as she looked at me. “Lily, Aurora meant well. Why are you being so ungrateful?” 

Our father put down his newspaper. “It’s just a bit of paint. It’s best if the whole house has a uniform style.” 

I looked at their entitled faces and understood. 

In this house, my opinion didn’t matter. Only Aurora’s tears did. 

Fine. My own eyes reddened, and my voice, thick with unshed tears, was even more wounded than Aurora’s. “Dad, Mom, I’m not ungrateful.” 

“I just heard… I heard that this was the nursery you prepared for me when I was a baby. This color… this was the color you chose for me with your own hands all those years ago.” 

I lifted my head, my eyes shimmering with tears I stubbornly refused to let fall. 

“I wanted to keep it… as if… as if I was never lost at all.” 

“I wanted to feel, just for a moment, what it would have been like if I had grown up with you.” 

My voice began to tremble, finally breaking into a choked sob. 

“I’m sorry. I’m being selfish. I shouldn’t have asked. Go ahead and paint it. Just… pretend I never came back.” 

The living room fell into a dead silence. 

The blame on my parents’ faces morphed into shock, then into a tidal wave of guilt. 

My mother pushed Aurora away and rushed to hug me. “My sweet girl, don’t cry, don’t cry. It’s Mommy’s fault We’re so sorry.” 

My father roared at the workers, “Who told you to touch the young miss’s room? Nobody touches it! Get you things and get out!” 

My brother, Julian, who had just come downstairs, saw the scene and hurried to my side, awkwardly patting my back. “Lily, don’t cry. No one will dare touch your room.” 

Aurora stood frozen, her gentle expression stiffening on her face. 

She probably never imagined I would take her little trick and amplify it tenfold. 

She opened her mouth to speak, but I started crying harder. “Sister, please don’t be mad at me. I didn’t mear to make Mom and Dad angry, I just… I just can’t control myself.” 

With that one sentence, I preemptively blocked any accusation she could possibly make. If she said another word, she would be the one bullying the “victim”-the fragile, sensitive, long-lost daughter. 

The color drained from Aurora’s face, leaving it a sickly, mottled white. It was a beautiful sight.

After that day, no one mentioned painting the walls again. 

My room became the sole exception in this buttercream castle. 

Aurora lay low for a few days, but she was soon back to her old tricks. 

On her birthday, Julian gifted her a screaming-red Porsche, the keys nestled in a velvet box. 

Aurora shrieked with delight, hugging Julian’s arm and jumping for joy. “Thank you, brother! I love you so much!” 

The whole family watched her with beaming smiles. The atmosphere was warm and harmonious. 

I stood in the corner, an outsider. 

Julian’s gaze flickered over to me, a hint of discomfort in his eyes. He pulled another, smaller box from his pocket and handed it to me. “Lily, this is for you.” 

I opened it. It was a bracelet, clearly expensive, but compared to a Porsche, it was a pittance. 

A handout for a beggar. 

Aurora glanced at it, her words dripping with false generosity. “Wow, brother, you’re playing favorites. Lily’s gift is so beautiful too.” 

But the smug satisfaction in her eyes was unmistakable. 

I stared at the bracelet and didn’t take it. 

A tear escaped, then another. Not a loud sob, but a silent, steady stream. 

The laughter in the room died. 

All eyes were on me. 

I choked back a sob, my voice as light as a feather. “Brother, thank you. But… I can’t accept this.” 

Julian was stunned. “Why not?” 

I lifted my tear-filled eyes, my gaze a carefully crafted mix of inferiority, envy, and desolate sadness. “A gir like me, who grew up in the dirt… how could I ever be worthy of something so precious?” 

“My sister is a star in the sky. She deserves the best of everything. The sports car, the designer labels… it should all be hers.” 

“And me?” I let out a self-deprecating laugh, the tears flowing faster. “I’m just happy to have enough to ea and not cause you any trouble. I appreciate the thought, brother, but I’m truly not worthy of this gift.” 

I turned, covering my mouth to stifle my cries, and ran upstairs. 

My retreating figure was the loneliest, most tragic sight imaginable. 

Behind me, I heard Julian’s panicked voice. “Lily! That’s not it! Let me explain!” 

And my parents’ furious scolding. “Julian! What were you thinking? How could you treat them so differently?” 

Aurora’s hand, still holding the car keys, was frozen in mid-air. 

The smile on her face was uglier than a grimace. 

That night, Julian knocked on my door. 

His eyes were red, filled with guilt. “Lily, I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking.” 

I sat by the window, hugging my knees, my eyes swollen like walnuts, and said nothing. 

He pushed a black card toward me. “There’s three million on this. It’s from me, to make it up to you. You can buy any car you want. Something even better than your sister’s.” 

I didn’t look at the card. I just stared out the window. “Brother, I don’t want things. I just… I just feel that in your hearts, I’ll never be as important as she is.” 

“It’s okay,” I whispered. “I accept it. After all, she was the one who was with you for eighteen years.” 

Julian looked like his heart was about to break. “No! You’re my real sister! From now on, I’ll give you the best of everything!” 

He practically forced the card into my hand before fleeing my room. 

I looked at the card, wiping away the last of my crocodile tears. 

You want to play games with me? Aurora, darling, you’re an amateur.

The family’s fiancé was named James Nordling. 

He was the heir to the Nordling Corporation and was originally engaged to Aurora. 

After I was found, the engagement became… awkward. 

More than once, Aurora performed her “kindness and generosity” for my parents. 

“Dad, Mom, the engagement was with the Sterling family. Now that my sister is back, she should be the one 

to inherit it. I’m willing to step aside and wish James and my sister all the best.” 

Every time she said it, my parents’ hearts ached for her, and they would look at me as if I were a thief. 

The first time James came over for dinner, the atmosphere was thick with tension. 

He sat across from me, his gaze polite but distant. He spent most of his time talking to Aurora. 

They talked about mutual friends, high-society parties, and topics I couldn’t even begin to understand. 

I just ate my food quietly, a ghost at the table. 

During the meal, Aurora put some food on my plate, her gesture as intimate as if we were real sisters. “Lily eat more. You’re too thin.” 

Then, her hand “slipped.” A piece of greasy braised pork fell directly onto my faded, worn-out t-shirt. 

A large grease stain bloomed across the fabric. 

“Oh!” she gasped, her face a mask of apology. “I’m so sorry, Lily, I didn’t do it on purpose! Your clothes…” 

All eyes focused on the stain on my chest. 

The t-shirt was one I’d brought from the countryside, a ten-dollar bargain bin find. 

In a room full of couture and luxury brands, it was already out of place. Now, it was a joke. 

If I got angry, I’d be making a scene. 

If I swallowed it, I’d be admitting I was inferior. 

looked at the stain. I didn’t get angry. Instead, I smiled. 

A smile that was sadder than tears. 

Then I looked up, my eyes swimming with moisture I refused to let fall. 

“It’s okay, sister,” I said, my voice hoarse. “It’s just an old shirt. If it’s dirty, I’ll just throw it away.” 

“It’s the only kind of clothes I have, anyway. Not like you, sister. You wear designer brands I can’t even recog nize.” 

“I’m the one embarrassing this family. I shouldn’t have worn something like this to the dinner table.” 

I put down my chopsticks, stood up, and bowed deeply to everyone. “I’m sorry, Dad, Mom, Mr. Nordling Please excuse me.” 

I turned and walked away, my back ramrod straight. 

Every step I took felt like it was landing on their hearts. 

I could feel James’s gaze shift from Aurora to me for the first time, a look of curiosity and pity in his eyes. 

Behind me, I heard my mother’s suppressed fury. “Aurora Sterling! Look what you’ve done!” 

Aurora was speechless. “Mom, I really didn’t mean to…” 

“Enough! I think you did it on purpose!” 

A carefully planned family dinner, ruined by a single, unshed tear. 

That night, I received a text from James. 

[Are you free tomorrow? I’ll take you to buy some clothes.] 

I looked at the message and smiled. 

The fish was on the hook.

I didn’t turn James down. 

The next day, I showed up at the designated mall, wearing the same grease-stained t-shirt. 

When James saw me, his handsome brows knitted together. 

“Why are you still wearing this?” 

I looked down. “This… this is the only decent shirt I have to wear out.” 

His expression grew even more complicated. 

He said nothing, simply took my wrist and pulled me into the most exclusive luxury boutique in the mall. 

The sales assistants’ eyes were full of contempt when they saw my outfit. 

But after they saw James’s black card, their faces instantly lit up with the warmest smiles. 

James pointed to a rack of the latest dresses. “Anything that suits her, wrap it up.” 

Then he looked at me, his voice softening slightly. “Go try them on.” 

I acted like a startled rabbit, waving my hands frantically. “No, no, it’s too expensive, I can’t accept.” 

“It’s not for you,” he said flatly. “It’s for the Sterling family’s reputation. When you go out in cheap clothes, you embarrass all of us.” 

The words were harsh, but I knew it was his clumsy way of being kind. 

I was “forced” to change into a white dress. 

The girl in the mirror was slender, pale, with a timid look in her eyes-a complete stranger to my usual self. 

When I walked out, James’s gaze faltered for a moment. 

He quickly recovered, handing his card to the assistant. “Wrap them all up.” 

When we left the store, he was carrying more than a dozen bags. 

I trailed behind him, head down. “Mr. Nordling, thank you. But I still can’t…” 

‘Call me James,” he interrupted. 

I paused. 

He stopped and turned to look at me, his eyes deep. “Lily Sterling, you don’t have to live so cautiously. You are the rightful heiress of the Sterling family.” 

n the sunlight, his features were sharp, his eyes holding an emotion I couldn’t decipher. 

I sneered internally, but my words were soft. “But in their hearts, my sister is the real one. I’m just an outsider. 

The tears started to well up again. 

‘I don’t want to take anything that belongs to my sister,” I looked him in the eye. “Including you.” 

‘E-James,” I stammered, “you and my sister look so good together. I wish you both the best.” 

‘And I wish… that I can get used to being alone soon.” 

With that, I grabbed the shopping bags and ran, leaving James standing alone, his brow furrowed and his face dark. 

He started avoiding Aurora. 

When she called him, he was always in a meeting or on a business trip. 

When she went to his office, his secretary would say he wasn’t there. 

Aurora was going mad. She came to confront me. “Lily Sterling, what did you say to James?” 

I looked at her with wide, innocent eyes. A mist began to form. “Sister, what are you talking about? Why wouId I say anything to Mr. Nordling?” 

“I only told him that I wish you both the best and that he should treat you well.” 

“Sister, don’t you believe me?” I clutched my chest, my face a mask of hurt. “How could you think of me like that? Am I really the kind of person who would ruin your relationship?” 

‘I…” Aurora was speechless. 

pressed my advantage, my tears flowing freely. “I know, it’s all my fault! I shouldn’t have come back, I shou- dn’t have appeared in your lives! I’ll leave now, I’ll leave the Sterling family and never bother you again!” 

made a show of rushing for the door. 

My parents, who were just coming downstairs, saw the scene and were horrified. 

‘Aurora! What are you doing to your sister again!” my father roared. 

Your sister is fragile, and you’re still provoking her! What are your intentions!” my mother added. 

Aurora stood there, trembling, watching me cower in our mother’s arms. Her eyes were filled with venom. 

She knew she had lost again. 

Utterly and completely. 

Aurora started to copy me. 

She realized that a direct confrontation was useless, so she began to play the victim, too. 

One afternoon, the maid brought out a plate of sliced watermelon and handed the first serving to me. 

Aurora saw this but said nothing. 

A few moments later, she suddenly clutched her stomach, her face pale. “Oh, my stomach hurts so much.” 

My mother was instantly concerned. “What’s wrong, Aurora?” 

Aurora leaned weakly against the sofa, her eyes red. “It’s nothing, Mom. My stomach is probably just too 

sensitive for cold watermelon.” 

As she spoke, she glanced meaningfully at the watermelon in front of me. 

The implication was clear: Lily gets to eat it, but I can’t. You don’t care about me. 

In the past, my mother would have rushed to comfort her and then blamed me or the maid. 

But I was a step ahead. 

Before my mother could even speak, the fork in my hand clattered to the floor. 

I clutched my chest, my face even paler than Aurora’s, my breathing ragged. “Sister… do you… do you think I stole your watermelon?” 

‘I’m sorry, it’s my fault. I forgot you have a delicate stomach. A coarse person like me can eat anything.” 

‘Please don’t be angry, sister. When you’re angry, I… my chest feels tight, I can’t… I can’t breathe…” 

I gasped for air, my hand clawing at my chest as if I were about to suffocate. 

‘Lily!” 

‘Quick! Call an ambulance!” 

The entire family went into a panic. 

My father rushed over to help me breathe, my mother held me and cried, and my brother, Julian, dragged Aurora aside, hissing at her, “Aurora! You did that on purpose, didn’t you! You know Lily is fragile, and you still pulled a stunt like that to provoke her!” 

Aurora was dumbfounded. 

She had a stomachache. I was on the verge of “death.” 

How could she possibly compete? 

The family doctor was summoned. After a full examination, his conclusion was grave: the young miss had suffered from heart palpitations and respiratory distress due to extreme emotional agitation. She needed complete rest and must not be subjected to any further stimulation. 

From that day on, my status in the house was untouchable, like a priceless, fragile artifact. 

If I so much as frowned, the entire family would flock to my side, fussing over me. 

Aurora was completely isolated. 

She became an awkward presence in her own home. Everyone was terrified that she might accidentally shatter the “porcelain doll.” 

She wouldn’t accept it. 

She knew she had to find a way to get rid of me for good. 

So, she orchestrated her masterpiece.

One day, as I was coming down the stairs, I saw Aurora standing at the landing. 

When she saw me, a strange glint appeared in her eye. 

The moment I was beside her, she let out a sharp scream and threw herself down the staircase. 

‘Ah-!” 

The tremendous crash brought everyone running. 

My parents and Julian burst out of their rooms to see Aurora lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs, he forehead gashed and bleeding. 

And me, standing perfectly unharmed in the middle of the staircase. 

Aurora lifted a weak hand and pointed at me, tears and blood mingling on her face. “It was… it was my sist er… She pushed me…” 

Instantly, all eyes shot toward me like daggers. 

Their gazes were filled with shock, suspicion, and suppressed rage. 

I was the enemy. 

If I tried to defend myself, no one would believe me. One person was perfectly fine, the other was bleeding on the floor. It was obvious who to believe. 

Lying on the ground, Aurora’s lips curved into a faint, triumphant smirk. 

She thought she had won. 

I looked at her, and at the family huddled around her. 

I didn’t argue. I didn’t scream. 

I just widened my eyes, those eyes that the doctor had diagnosed as “fragile,” and filled them with absolute terror and disbelief. 

My body began to tremble uncontrollably. 

“It… it wasn’t me…” 

I whispered those three words. Then, my eyes rolled back into my head, and I fell backward like a plank of wood. 

My head hit the hard marble steps with a sickening thud. 

The sound was far more horrifying than Aurora’s tumble. 

Before I lost consciousness, I saw the triumphant smile on Aurora’s face freeze and shatter. 

She probably hadn’t calculated that if she was going to play the victim, I was willing to play the martyr. 

You act hurt? I’ll act dead. 

Let’s see who plays the game better. 

When I woke up, I was in a hospital. 

Everything was white, and the air smelled of antiseptic. 

My parents and Julian were gathered around my bed, their faces etched with exhaustion and fear. 

The moment I opened my eyes, my mother burst into tears. “Lily, you’re finally awake! You scared us to death!” 

A sharp pain shot through the back of my head. I let out a soft hiss. 

Julian immediately tensed. “What is it? Does your head still hurt? Doctor! Doctor!” 

A doctor rushed in and examined me. 

“The patient has a mild concussion,” he announced, looking grim. “Combined with her pre-existing emotional instability, the immense shock caused her to faint.” 

He looked at my parents, his tone serious. “Mr. and Mrs. Sterling, the patient’s condition is not optimistic. Her mental state is extremely fragile, like a tightly wound string. Any further disturbance, no matter how small, could cause it to snap.” 

As her family, you must create an environment for her that is absolutely safe and relaxing. She cannot endure any more grievances or provocations.” 

The doctor’s words were a final verdict, sealing Aurora’s guilt. 

My father’s face was ashen. He glanced at Aurora, who was standing by the door with a bandage on her own head. His eyes were colder and more disappointed than I had ever seen them. 

Aurora’s injury was superficial. Mine was a “mental breakdown” plus a “concussion.” 

It was clear who was the real victim. 

Lying in the bed, I weakly turned my head to look at Aurora, a single tear tracing a path down my temple. 

“Sister, why would you say that? I didn’t push you, I really didn’t…” 

“I know you hate me. You want me to leave this family. Fine. I’ll go.” 

“When I get out of the hospital, I’ll leave and never come back. You can all… you can all just pretend you never had me as a daughter.” 

My voice was a mere thread of sound, but every word was a dagger to their hearts. 

“Nonsense!” my father snapped. “You are a Sterling. No one can make you leave!” 

He turned to Aurora, his voice harsher than ever before. “Aurora Sterling! Apologize to your sister!” 

Aurora jolted, looking at him in disbelief. “Dad, you want me to apologize to her? You’d rather believe her than me?” 

“I believe the doctor! And I believe the evidence!” he roared. “I’ve already reviewed the security footage! There was no one within three feet of you. you fell on your own! And you still have the audacity to frame you sister!” 

The blood drained from Aurora’s face. 

She had calculated everything, except for the security camera in the living room that happened to capture that exact corner of the staircase. 

My parents hadn’t mentioned it before because they were still trying to protect her, to give her a chance to confess. 

But she hadn’t taken it. 

Aurora panicked, crying and trying to explain. “No, Dad, Mom, I didn’t mean it, I was just… I was confused for a moment…” 

“Enough!” my mother cried, pointing at her, her eyes full of disappointment. “I told you to treat her like a sister, and this is what you do! Lily suffered so much to come back to us, how could you be so cruel!” 

“Starting today, you’re moving out! And you will think long and hard about what you have done wrong!”  

Aurora looked as if she’d been struck by lightning. 

She was being kicked out. 

She had lost. Utterly and completely. 

She glared at me with pure hatred. I just buried my face in my pillow, my shoulders shaking slightly, playing the part of the poor soul wronged by the world. 

Only I knew that under the covers, I was smiling. 

The security camera? 

I knew it was there all along. 

The reason I dared to pull that stunt was because I had calculated that the moment the truth was revealed would be the most devastating blow of all. 

Aurora was kicked out. 

became the sole center of the family’s universe. 

My “illness” fluctuated under their meticulous care. 

One day, I’d overhear that a project at the company wasn’t going well, and I’d immediately suffer from her alpitations. 

The next, I’d see a maid looking glum, and I’d be struck with insomnia. 

The entire family walked on eggshells, terrified of accidentally upsetting my glass heart. 

Julian cancelled all non-essential social events to come home and spend time with me. 

My father would call from board meetings just to ask if I was in a good mood. 

My mother barely left my side, personally brewing soups and cooking my meals. 

James started visiting more frequently. 

He never mentioned Aurora. He just sat with me quietly, telling me lighthearted jokes or bringing me little trinkets to cheer me up. He knew that the scales in his heart had tipped completely in my favor. 

Aurora wasn’t going to be exiled without a fight. 

She tried desperately to contact my parents and brother, crying and repenting, saying she knew she was wrong. 

But no one responded. 

The doctor had said that any news about her could be a trigger for me. 

For my sake, my family hardened their hearts and blocked all of her contact information. 

Desperate, she decided to make one last gamble at the company’s annual charity gala. 

It was a star-studded event, and as the hosts, the Sterling family was in the spotlight. 

I appeared in the ballroom on my father’s arm, wearing a magnificent star-dusted gown that James had picked out for me. 

My arrival caused a small stir. 

Everyone had heard the rumors about the Sterling’s long-lost, sickly daughter. 

My pale complexion and fragile demeanor perfectly matched the stories. 

Halfway through the evening, the lights dimmed, and the large screen on the stage lit up. 

Everyone assumed it was a special part of the program. 

But the person who appeared on the screen was me. 

In the video, I was in the family garden, laughing and chatting with a gardener. 

I looked perfectly healthy, without a trace of sickness. I even reached out to playfully bat at a butterfly, smili ng like a child. 

The scene then cut to me in my room, humming a song while watering my succulents. 

The carefree, relaxed girl in the video looked nothing like a “mentally fragile” patient. 

The hall erupted in whispers. 

Everyone was looking at me with strange, speculative eyes. 

“Didn’t they say she was on her deathbed? She looks fine to me.” 

“It must be an act, right? The games of the rich… what kind of drama is this?” 

My parents’ faces turned pale with shock and embarrassment. 

Just then, Aurora walked onto the stage, dressed in a white gown like a vengeful angel. 

She held a microphone, her eyes brimming with tears. “Everyone, I know you’re all confused. Tonight, I am going to expose a liar for who she truly is!” 

She pointed at me, her voice shrill. “Lily Sterling! She’s not sick at all! It’s all an act! She used her fake illness to win my parents’ sympathy and kick me out of my own home! She is the truly manipulative, evil one!” 

The flashbulbs of every camera in the room turned on me. 

I stood frozen, my body trembling slightly, like a frightened deer. 

My parents tried to rush to my side, but I stopped them with a look. 

I looked at Aurora on the stage, at the “healthy” version of myself on the screen, and at the contemptuous, entertained faces in the audience. 

I smiled. 

It was a smile full of despair and self-mockery. 

Then, I looked up at the screen and whispered a single sentence. 

My voice wasn’t loud, but the microphone on my dress carried it throughout the entire hall. 

“So, I’m only allowed to smile when I think no one is watching.” 

“So, even a moment of happiness is a sin for me.” 

As the words left my lips, the video on the screen kept playing. 

This was something Aurora hadn’t anticipated. 

The footage she had given the TV station ended there. 

In the video, after my smile in the garden faded, I turned to the gardener. 

“Thank you, Mr. Gable,” I said, my voice heavy with sadness. “Talking to you… it helps me forget for a little while.” 

“But then I remember that my sister is still out there, suffering, and that my parents are so worried because of me… and my heart feels like it’s being crushed by a stone.” 

The scene changed again. 

In my room, after watering the plants, I put down the watering can and walked to the window, staring at the sky. 

“If I died,” I whispered to myself, “wouldn’t everyone be free?” 

“My sister could come home. My parents wouldn’t have to worry about me. My brother wouldn’t have to walk on eggshells around me.” 

“That would be for the best.” 

The video ended. 

The hall was dead silent. 

If the first half of the video was “evidence,” the second half was the most devastating rebuttal imaginable. 

It painted me as a kind, forbearing, tragic figure who bore her suffering in silence and was even willing to die to grant everyone else peace. 

And Aurora, the one who had maliciously edited the video and publicly attacked the fragile, long-lost heiress, was exposed as a petty, vindictive clown. 

Aurora stood on the stage, her face ashen. 

She didn’t know that the TV station employee she had bribed had been counter-bribed by James for double the price. 

The trap she thought she had set was, from the very beginning, for herself. 

I looked at her, and my tears finally broke free. 

“Sister, why… why would you do this to me?” 

“Do you… do you really have to push me to my death before you’re satisfied?” 

I clutched my chest, coughed violently, and a spray of blood erupted from my lips as my body went limp and collapsed. 

It wasn’t real. 

It was a blood packet I’d hidden in my mouth earlier. 

But to everyone else, it looked like I had been so devastated that I had coughed up blood and was on the brink of death. 

“Lily!” 

“Ambulance! Someone call an ambulance!” 

The entire ballroom descended into chaos. 

As I was lifted onto a stretcher, I caught a glimpse of Aurora through the crowd. She was being dragged away by security, her face a blank, gray mask, muttering over and over, “No… it wasn’t supposed to be like this…” 

Game over. 

After that night, Aurora’s reputation was in ruins. 

The drama of the “Vicious Fake Heiress Drives Real Heiress to the Brink” became the biggest joke in high society. 

To quell the public outcry and to give me “justice,” the Sterling family publicly announced that they were disowning Aurora and sending her to a sanatorium abroad. 

They called it “treatment.” 

In reality, it was exile. 

And I, in the eye of the storm, became the most pitiable victim. 

My “illness” was now more legitimate than ever. 

The company’s psychologists and psychiatrists unanimously diagnosed me with severe PTSD and an extre me lack of a sense of security. 

The only cure, they said, was to give me a sense of absolute control and safety. 

At a family meeting, in front of all my uncles and elders, I sat in a wheelchair, wrapped in a thick blanket, and voiced my “wish” in a faint whisper. 

“I’m scared. I always feel like… everything I have can be taken away from me at any moment.” 

‘Dad, Mom, Julian… could I… could I have a small portion of the company’s shares?” 

‘Only when I’m holding something in my own hands can I sleep at night. Just a little bit. One percent, maybe? 

I looked at them with eyes full of pleading and anxiety. 

My father looked at my pale little face, his heart aching with an almost unbearable pity. 

He waved his hand dismissively. “One percent? You are my only daughter! Everything the Sterlings have wil be yours one day!” 

‘To help you recover in peace, starting today, I am transferring fifty percent of my shares to your name!” 

A gasp went through the room. 

Julian, far from objecting, was the first to support it. “I agree. As long as Lily can get better, forget the shares we’d give her the whole company.” 

My mother held my hand, tears streaming down her face. “Yes, it’s all for our Lily. We don’t want anything, as ong as you’re healthy.” 

And just like that, without firing a single shot, I gained controlling interest in the Sterling Corporation. 
Ibecame the true master of the house. 

A few months later, my health “recovered,” and I officially joined the company. 

James became my most capable assistant and my most trusted partner. 

He asked me more than once, “Back at the hospital, you already knew about the security camera in the living room, didn’t you?” 

I would just smile and say nothing. 

Some things are better left unsaid. That is the rule of the game for adults. 

Occasionally, I receive a postcard from abroad. There’s no signature, just a single sentence written in twisted, hateful English: 

“I will be back.” 

I’d look at the postcard and casually feed it to the shredder. 

Then I’d pick up my coffee and gaze out the window. 

You want to play? 

I’m ready anytime. 

Except next time, you might not even be able to afford the plane ticket home.

Sunset isn’t just music—it’s that perfect in-between when the day exhales and the night begins to breathe. Warm, groovy, and slightly nostalgic, it drifts between mellow soul, modern jazz, and chill funk with effortless rhythm.
The opener, “Sunset” by Ya!lX, sets the tone with silky textures and soft percussion that shimmer like fading light on water. Tracks like “Sweetest Thing on This Side of Heaven” and “Lola” radiate that analog warmth—smooth, vintage soul that feels both romantic and reflective. The Velvet Moment and In the Name of Love slide in like conversations over late coffee, while Kokoroko’s “Idea 5 (Call My Name)” and Say She She’s “Under the Sun” elevate everything with their lush brass and layered harmonies.
Then comes the deeper groove: Moses Yoofee Trio, The Olympians, and Amos Ever Hadani bring smoky late-night energy—Afro-soul, jazz fusion, and world funk blending like fading colors in the sky. By the time Fred Irie and JahBeard close it out, you’re not just listening—you’re floating.
It’s the sound of balance: sunlight meeting twilight, movement meeting calm, old-school soul meeting future jazz.
 Press play, watch the light change, and let Sunset carry you there. 🌇

1nye2kt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nye2kt,C40 vs EK43,"Here we are friends! 

Throughout this week I have been testing my C40 against my Ek43 (6 tests, so not concrete testing numbers :p) 

In my previous post I was testing SSP HU burrs against Mahlkonig pre 2015 ‘A’ burrs, however for this test I installed post 2015 ‘B’ burrs. The reason for this is because a majority of people who have access to an EK would probably have the type ‘B’ burrs installed. (They were indeed aligned using the whiteboard marker method) 


The coffee I used is a Washed Geisha grown by Emilio Lopez in the Chalchuapa, Santa Ana region of El Salvador. 

The acid in the coffee is citric reminiscent of pineapple and orange and malic reminiscent of fresh white grapes. It also exhibits a grape and honey-like sweetness and tonnes of jasmine / white tea florality. The overall weight of this coffee on the palate is light/medium, creamy texture, with a lingering finish. 


Here’s how I brewed: 

I decided to use a UFO dripper with the UFO type A filters. The water I used is the same as in the previous test. 

- Dose: 15g 
- Water weight: 230g
- Temperature: 93 Celsius

Method: 

- 0:00 - 45g (swirl pour)
- 0:40 - 45g (90g T swirl pour)
- 1:10 - 100g (190g T centre pour)
- 2:20 - 40g (230g T centre pour)
- no agitation or swirling was introduced.

(All pours were at about a 6g per second pour speed at a consistent height) 

C40: 

- Time: 3:08
- Grind size: 23 clicks (860 micron) 
- EY: 18.92%

EK43: 

- Time: 3:02 
- Grind size: 13.6 (875 micron)
- EY: 18.75%

The intention for this test was to have both coffees ground with a similar average grind particle size measured using a DiFluid Omni. This was so I could taste the nuances of what each grinder had to offer (particle distribution and shape).

As shown on the graphs on the Omni, the C40 has a much wider grind size distribution than the EK43. This is consistent to my previous tests. 

Both coffees tasted great. They both stayed true to the tasting notes above that were accumulated at the roastery by me and the rest of the quality control team. 


Here are my findings: 

C40: 

The texture in the brews that the C40 produced were heavier/juicier but had more astringency. I found the C40 to generally give a wider picture of what the coffee had to offer. The astringency was minimal but could be perceived easily with the EK43 brew sitting next to it. 

EK43 with ‘B’ burrs:

Much higher clarity than the C40. Texturally these brews were a bit thinner and were missing some of the bright acidity that the C40 had to offer. I didn’t perceive any astringency in these brews and I found the EK43 brews to generally be sweeter and be more balanced. 

To me these are both great grinders. Typically the C40 brews are fuller and juicer however did carry some astringency/drying qualities. These were particularly prominent when compared with the EK brew sitting next to it. I don’t know if they would be as prominent if I hadn’t been comparing. 
The EK even with the type ‘B’ burrs to me better showcased what the coffee had to offer. The brews exhibited much higher clarity and balance. 

For me the EK is the winner for this particular coffee, maybe a different coffee will be better for the C40? 

Cheers!

1nye0tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1nye0tu/aio_for_being_scared_to_go_home/,AIO for being scared to go home?,"My boyfriend has a very anxious attachment style to the point where he gets upset when I need space. I work a very demanding 8-5 wfh job answering phones all day for customers. I’m also an introvert. I don’t mind the job so much because at least the conversations aren’t face to face, but by the end of the day I need a break. Especially mentally and especially from talking. He will get home and as soon as I’m off work and trying to relax he tries to start up conversations and get me to be intimate with him. He gets very upset when I ask for the time and space that I need to relax before being social again, to the point where he will sulk and pout and take it personally that I am not giving him attention. I have tried many times and in many ways to get him to understand that it’s not an anti him thing but a for me thing when I get time to myself in those moments after work and in stressful times in general. This week was especially hard. I vocalized that many times and was met with basically blank stares and multiple questions about why, trying to get me to help him understand. Obviously when I’m asking for time to relax my brain that is the last thing I need to be faced with. It’s becoming to the point where I will actively avoid him because I know that the questions and requests to talk about it will take over and I won’t get any time to myself. We spent time together Monday evening and were even intimate, but by Tuesday he was demanding of my attention again when I had a very very long day and I asked for some time to just relax. This caused the pouting and sulking to begin and every day that passed and I did not get the space I needed it only became worse. I am definitely not turned on by someone being so impatient with my time and needs and as a result it just increased my need for space every day going forward. 

Yesterday I had therapy and talked the situation over with my therapist and we agreed that I would try to communicate my needs to him with intention and offer up a solution that would make us both happy. I asked for the night to unwind without expectations, and to be allowed to sleep until 10am today without interruption and then we could have some intimate time and go on a day date together because my needs would finally be met and so could his. So when he came home I had the talk and told him my intentions. It seemed to go over ok, I thought. We watched a movie last night and cuddled even though I could tell he was still somewhat bothered. This morning he woke up before me and I thought things were going to plan until he came up at 9:55am and started packing his bookbag to go for a hike. He does this any time he’s frustrated with me, so I knew I was about to face an argument no matter what. I asked why and reminded him of the plans and he started going off on how I ripped his covers off this morning when I was coming back to bed after using the bathroom. I had no idea and immediately said I was unaware and didn’t know and apologized. I also reminded him that we were supposed to go have my tire patched on my car and he couldn’t take it anywhere. His tone changed a bit and he said he was going to do that instead and he left. I got up and made a coffee and sat down to wake up thinking everything was fine. When he came back he sat down and started to confront me about my behavior that morning and insisted that I had a bone to pick with him. I hadn’t even gotten 2 sips into my coffee and was not in the mood so after sitting silently for a while hoping he would leave me alone I went upstairs to the bedroom to be alone. Actually, I knew that wasn’t safe enough because he has a habit of following me to the room and forcing me into confrontation so I’ve started hiding out in the bathroom shower that is in the bedroom instead. He kept unlocking the doors and coming in anyway, to the point where I flipped out and yelled to PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE repeatedly, screaming even, while I was basically cornered in the shower. He refused and kept trying to make me talk with him again. When I saw my chance to get out I grabbed my keys and ran out the door. I ended up calling the police for advice and now I’m sleeping in my car tonight because I don’t feel safe going home. AIO?",1,1759636069.0,AIO,3,0.67,False

We might get back together?,"Im a 23M and my ex-girlfriend is 22F, we had been dating for 3 years, known each other for 4. I met her at work and since that day we fell in love with each other truly. We started as a fun no label thing. After a few months she told me she had true feelings for me and couldn’t be in an open relationship. I got the courage and asked her to be my girlfriend. We would see each other almost every day, to the point of her pretty much staying with me the whole time. After two years we decided to move in together, 6 months after that we decided to get a puppy and raise him together. 

The last month has been super though since we were having big fights (that ultimately led to our breakup) It was really though I was annoyed at mundane things like she wasn’t helping me out enough with the dishes or cleaning around, and she felt like I could help her out more with our dog, that led to a huge fight where I started screaming (which I know is wrong) I was honestly super angry and said that “I couldn’t remember the last time I was happy” but really I know I said to hurt and didn’t mean it at all. I know what I said is done and can’t take it back. So after those two big fights we decided we would take a break and started sleeping separately. After a couple of days she retracted herself and told me we could go back to sleeping in the same bed. I was so happy and felt like we were on the right path but just a few days after she told me that we needed to talk and thats when I knew.

She said “ I don’t think we should be together anymore” it broke me. She told me that those words I have said we’re intolerable and she couldn’t stand the way I talked to her, she said that she wants someone that wants something for their lives, and basically she doesn’t trust me anymore. Big thing is that we still live together and our lease doesn’t end until summer of next year. Since that day we have slept in different rooms and didn’t really talk to each other. 2 weeks went by and she called me to pick her up from this bar, and I still love her like the first day so of course I’ll pick up the phone at 2 am if she needs me. I asked her if she was with other guys and she confessed that she kissed someone but regretted it and I broke again.

That next day I told her I couldn’t keep doing this, I cant be living under the same roof with my ex if shes kissing and talking to other guys ( it hadn’t even been 2 weeks that we broke up and she was already kissing someone else) I basically said “either you move out or I do because I cant keep living like this” This led to another deep conversation where I basically asked her what her “end goal was with me?” she said “I want us to be together” After she said that I was the happiest guy on earth for a second. She said that she can’t say for certain what she wants cause she doesn’t know and wants to focus on her school and work. She also said that she doesn’t see herself on a relationship until shes done with school (2 years from now) We landed on that we would still be single and that she wanted to see if I had changed for the better ( I’m a really pessimistic and negative person) so I’m working on that. So we kinda landed on well see where this goes. I also had to emphasize that I couldn’t do this if she kept talking to other guys and we agreed that we wouldn’t talk to other people. 

So after that we started hanging out a little bit, like we went grocery shopping, she made dinner, we have gone on hikes, walks and I’ve just had so much fun. So I’m in a situation where I don’t know exactly what my next step should be. I don’t know if I should take a step back and you know that things play out or if I should you know try to be more flirty and engaging with her.

One big thing that did happen was the fact that we did kiss like the day that we had that first talk and I looked at her and I asked her if I could kiss her she said yes, but then she stopped me saying that she didn’t wanna send the wrong message and that was that. But just a few days ago I texted her a picture of our dog and also said “I’m thinking about you” she responded by saying like hey you cannot say that to me because I don’t want things to get confusing and basically telling me that we’re not in a relationship anymore. 

so after that, I had to like talk to her again asking like OK so what are the boundaries like cause I did give her flowers I got her breakfast and made coffee for her all these things so I don’t know what I can do and what I can’t do so we landed on the fact that we we were not gonna text each other unless it was like necessary for the dog, but she did say that it was OK for me to still try and you know give her flowers compliment, her, and all these things. she did say that she couldn’t give me a timeline or a date us to when she thinks we could get back together or if we could ever get back together so we agreed that we would just keep going the way we are you know like not being a couple,more like roommates and seeing where it goes and just honestly hoping that she finds her response rather sooner than later.
And she said that she’d like to reassess our situation 4 months before our leased ended, so we could see where were at. 

My end goal is to be with her, I love her and told her that I want her to be my future wife and mother of my kids. Please help a depressed and anxious man that doesn’t know what to do.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hey Fredericton!

I’ve been toying with the idea of launching a quiet, cozy café + coworking space a place where you can focus, sip good coffee, and have actual desk space with strong Wi-Fi (not just a wobbly table by the espresso machine).

It’d be aimed at remote workers, freelancers, students, solo founders anyone who wants to get stuff done outside their house without the noise of a coffee shop or the price tag of big coworking chains.

Would love your quick input just vote on the poll, and if you’ve got thoughts or strong opinions (good or bad), toss them in the comments.

Thanks for the help and yes, I’ll share back what I learn from this. ✌🏼

1nydw62,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nydw62/we_broke_up_while_living_together_now_we_might/,We broke up while living together… Now we might get back?,"Im a 23M and my ex-girlfriend is 22F, we had been dating for 3 years, known each other for 4. I met her at work and since that day we fell in love with each other truly. We started as a fun no label thing. After a few months she told me she had true feelings for me and couldn’t be in an open relationship. I got the courage and asked her to be my girlfriend. We would see each other almost every day, to the point of her pretty much staying with me the whole time. After two years we decided to move in together, 6 months after that we decided to get a puppy and raise him together. 

The last month has been super though since we were having big fights (that ultimately led to our breakup) It was really though I was annoyed at mundane things like she wasn’t helping me out enough with the dishes or cleaning around, and she felt like I could help her out more with our dog, that led to a huge fight where I started screaming (which I know is wrong) I was honestly super angry and said that “I couldn’t remember the last time I was happy” but really I know I said to hurt and didn’t mean it at all. I know what I said is done and can’t take it back. So after those two big fights we decided we would take a break and started sleeping separately. After a couple of days she retracted herself and told me we could go back to sleeping in the same bed. I was so happy and felt like we were on the right path but just a few days after she told me that we needed to talk and thats when I knew.

She said “ I don’t think we should be together anymore” it broke me. She told me that those words I have said we’re intolerable and she couldn’t stand the way I talked to her, she said that she wants someone that wants something for their lives, and basically she doesn’t trust me anymore. Big thing is that we still live together and our lease doesn’t end until summer of next year. Since that day we have slept in different rooms and didn’t really talk to each other. 2 weeks went by and she called me to pick her up from this bar, and I still love her like the first day so of course I’ll pick up the phone at 2 am if she needs me. I asked her if she was with other guys and she confessed that she kissed someone but regretted it and I broke again.

That next day I told her I couldn’t keep doing this, I cant be living under the same roof with my ex if shes kissing and talking to other guys ( it hadn’t even been 2 weeks that we broke up and she was already kissing someone else) I basically said “either you move out or I do because I cant keep living like this” This led to another deep conversation where I basically asked her what her “end goal was with me?” she said “I want us to be together” After she said that I was the happiest guy on earth for a second. She said that she can’t say for certain what she wants cause she doesn’t know and wants to focus on her school and work. She also said that she doesn’t see herself on a relationship until shes done with school (2 years from now) We landed on that we would still be single and that she wanted to see if I had changed for the better ( I’m a really pessimistic and negative person) so I’m working on that. So we kinda landed on well see where this goes. I also had to emphasize that I couldn’t do this if she kept talking to other guys and we agreed that we wouldn’t talk to other people. 

So after that we started hanging out a little bit, like we went grocery shopping, she made dinner, we have gone on hikes, walks and I’ve just had so much fun. So I’m in a situation where I don’t know exactly what my next step should be. I don’t know if I should take a step back and you know that things play out or if I should you know try to be more flirty and engaging with her.

One big thing that did happen was the fact that we did kiss like the day that we had that first talk and I looked at her and I asked her if I could kiss her she said yes, but then she stopped me saying that she didn’t wanna send the wrong message and that was that. But just a few days ago I texted her a picture of our dog and also said “I’m thinking about you” she responded by saying like hey you cannot say that to me because I don’t want things to get confusing and basically telling me that we’re not in a relationship anymore. 

so after that, I had to like talk to her again asking like OK so what are the boundaries like cause I did give her flowers I got her breakfast and made coffee for her all these things so I don’t know what I can do and what I can’t do so we landed on the fact that we we were not gonna text each other unless it was like necessary for the dog, but she did say that it was OK for me to still try and you know give her flowers compliment, her, and all these things. she did say that she couldn’t give me a timeline or a date us to when she thinks we could get back together or if we could ever get back together so we agreed that we would just keep going the way we are you know like not being a couple,more like roommates and seeing where it goes and just honestly hoping that she finds her response rather sooner than later.
And she said that she’d like to reassess our situation 4 months before our leased ended, so we could see where were at. 

My end goal is to be with her, I love her and told her that I want her to be my future wife and mother of my kids. Please help a depressed and anxious man that doesn’t know what to do.

>The climax of this chapter is read with ""Dissolved Girl"" by ""Massive Attack"" 🎵

A shallow stream gurgled over rocks in the wooded depths of the park. He’d been walking along it for what felt like hours, studying its banks and picking up rocks that caught his eye. *I should reach the meet-up point soon,* he thought.

And sure enough the stream widened into a waist-deep river, the trees thinned and eventually opened to a clearing with tall grass and thorned bushes. Crickets shot across the grass blades at the tremors of his approaching footsteps and lightning bugs pulsed against the darkening sky.

At the mouth of the river a campsite was set up on the rocky banks. He sat in front of the crackling campfire, watching the cool lake surface as sparks floated into the sky before dying.

The sun left him, the heat dissipated with the horizon and coldness crept in. A mounting sense of discomfort built as the time of meeting passed and the landscape aged.

The water gently rolled toward his foot, and then back again before advancing further. He sat up and lifted his feet, but with a crash a wave swept underneath him, sizzling on the coals. He stood up, ankle deep in the water and backed away.

Undeterred, the tide rolled forward, encroaching on the camp. It penetrated the grass and logs and the tent began floating as it climbed up his calves and thighs.

He stumbled back up the bank, losing his footing in the loose soaked sand underneath but could not outpace the advancing waves. They climbed to his waist and up his chest as he began to float in them, desperately reaching for a tree or shrub to grab.

With a final scream, he was encompassed in the murk and swept away. He thrashed and spun randomly through it, brushing passing foliage and disrupted dirt clouds. After losing his bearings he sank further and slid along the ground, reaching for a handhold.

He finally righted himself and looked up through bleary eyes to search for the surface. He’d been pushed into the clearing, though he couldn’t see much through the opaque water.

It suddenly shook. Like the molecules themselves vibrated, drawing inward for a split second before restoring direction. A beat passed and again it shook, drawing forward into the darkness.

Reaching for a branch, he pulled himself closer to the focal point of the sound and froze with what he saw. Fastened in the dirt, through passing clouds of sand, were mighty pins, bolts bigger than his head.

The pins fastened massive chains that fell away into an abyss. As he floated closer, the endless pit widened, pitched, yawed as if wrestling itself from the ground. The water shook again, being drawn into it with a stronger force than before.

Gripping a root he steadied himself on the ground but the current pulled him in. He desperately scrambled for another handhold, kicking his feet before the root loosened and started pulling from the dirt.

The water shook again, weakening his grip as his feet dangled at the precipice. He looked back, his toes starting to dip over the edge, and closed his eyes in fear.

*Hiiiiiiii-* He awoke with a deep and sudden inhale. He was slick with sweat, burning hot in his comforter and relieved it was a dream. The blanket had tangled around his arms and legs forming a cocoon around him that was plastered to the ceiling. He had been floating in his sleep.

After a couple deep breaths, he focused inward on thoughts of weight, its balance and coordination. This was the only way he’d found to stop floating once it started, and as he did so the cocoon gently sank to the mattress.

Kicking a pile of laundry around, he picked up a clean looking towel and began drying himself off. He laid the comforter out flat on the ground and pulled the pillow cover off.

Collapsing on the couch, he kicked his feet onto the coffee table and leaned back. Soft moonlight bathed his legs and his heavy eyelids drew down, even though he knew he wouldn’t be allowed back to sleep. He thought back to his conversation earlier that day.

“You’re not thinking of where you wanna go, You’re thinking of how to get there,” Thomas said, gesturing with his hands.

Corey gripped the oven and refrigerator door, slightly levitating off the ground.

“Can you explain it another way?”

“I just did,” he said, munching on a handful of trail mix.

Corey furrowed his brow, focusing, and loosened up a bit before beginning to drift upward.

“You’ve already got floating down, just be patient.”

“How long does this usually take? I gotta go to work tomorrow.”

“Well, mostly a couple days, cause we merge when we’re kids and play around all the time…”

He chewed a bit and shrugged, “No idea how it works with older people.”

“But I guess that settles the Bene Elohim thing.”

“What’s all that about - I don’t go to church y’know,” Corey retorted, hanging from the oven.

“I mean, long story short, angels have jobs, and that’s a pretty bougie one.”

“A job from god huh,” Corey snorted.

“Is that so crazy?”

“No I mean,” he shrugged, “I guess the word *job* just seems funny...”

He changed the subject, “So does this mean god *is* real?”

“That’s a question…” Thomas hesitated, “That might be better for the Deacons.”

“Speaking of the Deacons, I’m not supposed to tell you this but…”

He thought for a moment then shrugged, “You’re gonna find out anyway.”

“I’m listening.”

“Well they got this summit coming up,” he rustled in the bag, “It’s a meeting they have every year.”

“And we’re *supposed* to be keeping the peace, but we mostly sit back and let everyone do it themselves.”

“Who’s this again?” Corey asked.

“You know like angels, and you met some witches right? The Amoretti coven? Well them - and the polymorphs and statues.”

Corey looked back blankly, “So these are all angels?”

“No, Corey, we’re angels. They’re humans. Most of their legacy is from Bene Elohim porking humans back in the day. Maybe something to ask your guardian about.”

“Yea I’ll put it on the list.”

“Anyway, the polymorphs are shapeshifters and statues are immortals. My words, not theirs.”

“So you guys are like monster police?”

“More like the monster UN, we just stop by every year and do a couple votes.”

He leaned forward in his chair, “But the last couple years they’ve been getting rowdy.”

He shook his finger, “This year, we’re going to use *your* testimony.”

“Am I allowed to say no?”

“Do whatever. But we know the Ammoretis brained a warlock in Seaside and Phil kept it quiet to avoid the drama.”

Corey resisted the urge to react, controlling his expression.

“And I hear through the grapevine they’ve been watching you.”

He pursed his lips slightly.

“If you testify at the summit, we might be able to put the human lines in a bit of a time-out.”

“Maybe not a big deal for the covens, but the statues are in big business, and they’re worried about their bottom line.”

“Sounds like I should keep it to myself.”

“You’ll pick a side eventually, or they pick you - I mean why do you think I’m here?”

He stared back.

“Don’t flatter yourself. If I know it, they know it. I’m keeping an eye on you for your own sake.”

Corey gently floated back down to the kitchen floor, letting go of the oven.

“Can they fly too?” he asked sheepishly.

“No,” he paused, “But neither can you.”

\---------------------------------------------

The night faded to day in chunks of shallow sleep separated by listless stares at the wall. It was his day off, but he was going to meet the Deacons at nine. He knew he should get as much sleep as possible, but each attempt resigned him further towards reality.

His mind wandered to what Thomas had said. Shapeshifting, immortals - they were just words he read about or saw on TV. Even in his experience with them, they didn’t account for the real thing. Witches? More like psychopaths who took hypnosis classes. Maybe they drugged him, he wasn’t completely sure.

The flying, sure, definitely threw a wrench in the gears - but even so he felt “seeing is believing”. For a shapeshifter, how would that work? Do they change faces like a disguise? Or is it like a werewolf, where they turn into an animal. He felt a pang of worry, did the neighbors have a dog? He mentally catalogued the people on his floor. Nope, no dogs- though they could have an indoor cat he supposed.

And immortals? Were they invincible or long lived… were they wise beyond their years or stuck in a child's mind? Thomas said they were tradesmen of some sort. He briefly imagined them like the mob, in nice suits with tommy guns, forever young and pushing competition out of their territory. He’d seen a show like that once.

His phone buzzed somewhere on the floor next to him. Digging around he found and grabbed it, reading the caller ID.

“What’s going on man, where you at?”

“It's eight in the morning, I'm home.”

“I’ve been up since six, couldn’t sleep. You wanna get breakfast?”

“Ah, I gotta catch up with my mom in a bit here,” he lied.

“Alright, call me back after.”

“Sounds good, see ya.”

He clicked the end button and sat back. It’d been a while since he talked to his friends, it’d been a while since he went out for a movie, it’d been a while since he felt like doing any of it. Everything had been sliding down from bad to worse and eventually sideways and he hadn’t hit the brakes once. Maybe he could swing by for lunch later.

But first, he had to feign ignorance about this meeting. He threw a jacket over his shoulder, grabbed a granola bar and walked down to his car. Sitting inside, he briefly considered following the leylines back to it, but turned on GPS anyway.

Sitting at the table he smiled at the Deacons, waiting for them to broach the topic.

“Thomas getting along with you?” Deaconess Vicky asked.

“Sure, he’s fine.”

“He’s sharp, you know - full honors,” Deacon Andrei added.

“He mentioned you’re still getting used to your wings. That’s exciting.”

Andrei continued, “Anything else you want to tell us?”

He sat for a moment before realizing the implication.

“I haven’t heard anything. I tried asking about a charge but - nothing.”

“Well we need to get that figured out. It’s kind of a political thing, but also, it helps us track down which angel it is.”

“Why don’t you just ask that too?”

“Sure, Angels share their names, but there are some considerations with it. It can be easier to just look it up,” he raised an eyebrow, nodding toward the bible on the desk.

“Anyway, this coming Saturday, there's a church event downtown at the Palazzio Hotel. Do you think you could come down?”

“I work Saturdays.” he flatly declined.

“It’s in the morning around ten. I’d like it if you could attend.”

“What’s it for?”

“It’s a yearly church event, we do team building exercises and review what went well and what could be improved. I’d like your input as the newest person here.”

“I’ll try, but no promises.”

A knock came from the door and Deacon Andrei excused himself. Corey sat for a moment before realizing he was left with Vicky who he hadn’t spoken with much.

“It’s just hard to get out of shifts on late notice,” he explained.

She twirled a lock of hair in her finger, “Thomas already told you about the others?”

“Yea,” he gave up, “he mentioned it.”

She smiled, “Just focus on yourself, it's what you need. But if you could come, it would help out.”

She thought for a moment.

“We just don’t know how to keep everyone happy. They all seem to just… do what they want lately.”

He thought of Nolan and his soaking wet apartment he had to air out for days.

“Ambitious. I think that’s the word.”

She nodded and stood.

“Think about it Corey, it’s just a couple of hours this weekend.”

\---------------------------------------------

He’d already told Thomas he wasn’t going. Phil had called that evening, unaware, offering a ride and he didn’t have the heart to tell him.

“Let me see how I feel in the morning,” he said weakly.

He couldn’t outright refuse Phil, he had to temper the refusal, make some sort of vain attempt at it before bailing. But he stood in the bathroom brushing his teeth with a pressure in the back of his mind anyway, like he was getting ready for a big day.

*I don’t know what I’m so worked up about, I’m not going,* he thought.

*I’ll just get up in the morning and shoot him a text saying I don’t feel well.*

Whether he went or not was irrelevant, but he knew relief from the exhaustion that had been plaguing him would not be found in scheduling a stressful morning meeting. Nevertheless he couldn't help but tidy up around the apartment, place a pair of jeans and a shirt at the end of the bed, line a pair of shoes up with the welcome mat, set an alarm.

All this neurotic setup against the backdrop of filth, overflowing trash bins, stacks of dishes in the sink. It doesn’t hurt to be prepared, he figured. He flicked the light off before crawling in bed.

*Did I lock the front door?*

He slid out while still looking at his phone and checked, brushing his hand against the deadbolt. As he walked back he realized he had not visually checked, and was suddenly uncomfortable not being one hundred percent sure.

Even though he had locked the deadbolt hundreds of times, he set his phone down and turned back once again to confirm, visually and by touch. Only then did he retreat back to his bed and get comfortable. He thought of the girl, standing by the coffee table with the vial of sand.

*Maybe I should replace my locks.*

He thought a little longer.

*Or get a gun.*

He visualized her turning again, dangling that necklace, and him blasting her in the chest with a shotgun.

He’d seen what they were capable of. Even on a strictly human level, it was nothing to take lightly. If they came back with more than just a teenage girl and jumped him, he wouldn’t be able to do much.

*Quit it, I’m not going tomorrow.*

He hushed his mind, rolled over and took deep breaths.

*Imaginary situations won’t help.*

He slowed his breathing and counted in and out. The beat of his heart slowed and thoughts became less erratic, and he drifted away.

 \---------------------------------------------

He scratched at his leg, adjusted the stereo, and swept back his hair. Anything to distract him from his racing thoughts. He’d been sitting in his car in the Palazzio Hotel parking lot for fifteen minutes trying to convince himself to get out and go in.

All things considered, he should have just skipped it. He slept terribly and was in no mood to socialize, but nevertheless he got dressed and drove over - pulled to the event out of some sort of obligation.

*If you don’t like it, you can just leave,* he told himself.

*Nobody’s trapping you there. Just pop in and say hey, you’ve got work anyway - can’t stay,* he reassured himself.

He stepped out of the car and walked inside. The woman at the desk didn’t even bother looking up at him. At the end of the hall double doors opened into a large hall of people sitting in plastic folding chairs.

To the right, a poster on a stand read “Renewed Community Church” with an arrow to the double doors. He slowly approached, scanning inside to the left and right for someone he might recognize. A head turned slightly and glasses glinted.

*That must be Melf.*

He wasn’t sitting next to Phil though. He looked for the Deacons, but the front of the room was too far away. He approached the doors quietly, stepping slowly to not draw attention. As he approached a familiar face rounded the corner.

“Corey, what are you doing here?” Thomas panicked.

He was dressed in slacks and a button up, his usual hat missing, exposing messy shoulder length hair.

“I’m not staying, I just wanted to see…” he struggled to find the words, “you know, who’s who.”

Thomas looked conflicted, “No, no, it’s fine. It’ll be… fine, just grab a seat in the back, they already started.”

He nodded and began to slowly walk forward before Thomas grabbed his shoulder.

“You sure about this?” he said in a serious tone.

Corey nodded.

“Let me grab you something, we got catering,” he gestured to a table lined with fruit and crackers he had ignored on the way in.

“Sure, thanks.”

“No problem, grab a seat in the back and I’ll be right there.”

He walked in without much notice and grabbed a seat near the door. As he sat, Deacon Andrei mounted the stage and began a speech.

“Friends, it’s good to see you again. Every year we meet, and this year we have the privilege to be at the Pallazio Hotel. I encourage you to enjoy the amenities like our buffet in the lobby, and ask that you treat the staff with kindness and respect for their hospitality. We have several plans for this summit, but we always start with singing! You should have a pamphlet in or around your seat for today’s program.”

The Deacon waited for the crowd while Thomas sat down and handed him a plate.

“Here, something to snack on.”

Three chocolate cookies were stacked on the paper plate.

“Thanks- how long does this usually go on for?”

“About thirty minutes if he doesn’t get on a tangent” Thomas whispered.

He sat back while they prepared to sing. He didn’t know the words and quietly munched on the cookies during the first song. As they continued he felt awkward and tried to hum along without drawing attention. Eventually they settled down and the Deacon continued his speech.

The minutes drug on and he got comfortable. Everyone was looking away from him like he didn’t exist. It wasn’t as bad as he thought.

He adjusted his shirt, pulling it from his chest. Was it hot in here? He’d taken off his jacket in the car and the polo he was wearing wasn’t even that thick. The fluorescent ceiling lights beat down on him as he touched his forehead - it was slick with sweat.

*I guess I really got worked up in the car*, he thought, and let some air in through the bottom of his shirt.

They sang a final song and welcomed Deaconess Vicky to the stage. She scanned the crowd and for a moment he thought she might have recognized his face, but she made no reaction.

“Unity is not some far fetched goal. It is something we can achieve and protect in our lifetime. Much like any other relationship, it simply requires the good will and faith of every party involved.”

Her speech continued as he pressed on his stomach lightly in discomfort. A drop of sweat fell to his shirt.

“I’ll be right back” he whispered to Thomas and excused himself.

He slinked out of the room and took a right, following the restroom sign on the wall. As he walked down the hall, its red patterned rug blurred beneath his feet.

*I do not feel good,* he thought.

No sooner had he opened the bathroom door, did he projectile vomit into the sink. It was a brown liquid - all the liquid he had - loosed in a jet stream. He gripped the porcelain sides, spitting into the pool as it drained. Coughing he moved to the second sink to swish and spit some water.

The typical wave of relief was cut short as his head began to swim. He turned and opened a stall before sitting on the toilet. He steadied himself on the paper dispenser.

Something wasn’t right. His stomach churned and sweat dripped down his neck. He focused and let his senses come to him. He couldn’t put a finger on it but it was like the air was moving backward. His vision vibrated slightly. He rubbed along his ankles, tasted his tongue, anything to nail down the indescribable sense that something was off.

And then he found it. Ever so slightly the reflection of the bathroom light in the stall door was rotating. Easy to miss with a glance but a prolonged stare revealed it clearly shrinking and breathing.

He wasn’t sheltered or an idiot. He’d felt this before, just in a less terrifying context. It had been years, but it brought him back to his camping trip in high school when he dropped acid and walked the beach with friends. The clam shells had raised up like pustules in the sand and the rolling waves fractalized for hours.

“You alright in there- Jesus, in the sink?”

The voice startled him.

“You okay?”

“Yea just don’t feel well” he choked out.

“You want some water or something?”

“No I…” he trailed off, standing and unlocking the stall door.

Thomas stood in the bathroom, using paper towels to wipe the edges of the sink.

“I should probably tell the staff - you look really pale.”

“Yea I feel… sick.”

“I can tell. You should gr-”

Corey slumped forward slightly and Thomas caught him.

“Yep, okay. Okay buddy let’s get you… I think you need a break.” he threw his arm around his shoulder and pushed open the door.

“My stomach is killing me,” Corey said, trying to focus on his feet.

“Why don’t I take you upstairs and you can lie down.”

Corey coughed and limply walked along with him as he called the elevator.

“I just need some, some-”

“Don’t worry about it, they’ve got medicine at the front desk. We’ll take care of the bathroom.”

He stood in the elevator leaning against the wall as the grid of buttons slowly collapsed on each other. The doors opened, then opened again. His vision bowed and warped until he strained his eyes to understand its depth.

“Here, it’s right here,” Thomas opened a door and led him in.

Two big beds lay against the wall with night stands.

“Just lay down here, I’ll get you a glass of water.”

The words rolled off him and bounced against the walls as he fell onto the bed. A cramp in his stomach made him contract into the fetal position before rolling on his stomach and stretching out.

“Here, I’ve got a glass r-----” the sound folded in on itself as he glanced up at Thomas’s face. It ballooned like a caricature as he spoke, evolving with each syllable.

*I can’t even-*

His own thought train diverted into itself and disappeared.

Next to the bed Thomas leaned down and dug around.

“Corey?” he said from below the bed.

He looked up at the ceiling and its texture molded into a sea of eyes.

“I…you…” he croaked out weakly.

Thomas stood up looking down at him lumped on the bed.

Corey could feel his hand pulled from under his back, stretched far above his head into the ether with a loud click. He pulled and stretched for a while, hearing thundering footsteps slowly dissipate into a closing door.

With a heave, he rolled over and stared upward. An iron circlet gripped his wrist, tangled in the spokes of the headboard. The shapes slithered and solidified in his head, struggling to materialize.

*Handcuff*, he thought.",1,1759635158.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False
1nydqml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Restaurant_Managers/comments/1nydqml/looking_for_a_pos_that_can_run_two_menus/,Looking for a POS that can run two menus simultaneously.,"We own a small pizza shop (Delivery / Carryout Only) and use HungerRush (formerly ReventioN). It has been a love / hate relationship, trending downward more towards hate as time goes on. I originally purchased the system outright as an all in one system, then they slowly started eliminating support for included systems to push towards integrated third parties at an additional cost, and changed their model to force you into a monthly fee model.

This year we opened up a coffee shop in an adjacent unit, connecting the two units. While they are two separate entities, each with its own kitchen, they are connected in the back. We originally intended to treat it as one business (it is the same corporation and licenses). So we asked for our system to be one store (so combined sales, labor, etc) but with two online presences. In summary, if they went to PizzaShop.com it would show them the Pizza Shop menu, and if they went to CoffeeShop.com it would show them that menu. We wanted it this way because while we market them as two separate businesses, there are shared items. For example, we make fresh pastries at the coffee shop, and if someone wanted to order a pizza delivery and get one of those pastries, it would be on the pizza shop menu, but print to that kitchen display.

Ultimately, HungerRush promised us that this would be no issue. However, when install came around, that suddenly was incorrect and now we are stuck with two different systems. This includes added headaches of paying double for all of our integrations because they treat them as two separate businesses (scheduling, loyalty, online ordering).

Toast recently reached out to us and promised that they can do what we are asking, but I'm hesitant. Does anyone currently work with a system that is capable of running two separate menus online, linking back to one single system, similar to a ghost kitchen?

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

My partner and I are moving from PA to the SF Bay Area soon. His office will be in Fremont, and I’m interviewing for an opportunity in SF (fingers crossed 🤞).

We’re looking for a brand-new apartment (studio or 1‑bed) — cleaner, modern finishes, minimal maintenance because yes, we both have a bit of OCD. We’d prefer to rely mostly on public transportation.

We’re DINKs. Access to food/grocery, maybe some culture, but also reasonably peaceful and safe. Not just low crime, but the kind where you feel comfortable going on walks in the evening or grabbing food nearby.

Budget: around $3,000/month rent.

Important to us: 
- In-unit washer and dryer
- Safe, walkable neighborhoods
- Good restaurants, coffee, grocery nearby
- Access to BART or other public transit (ideally both Fremont and SF-friendly)
- New construction

What neighborhoods or towns would you recommend that balance commute, safety, new buildings?

Alternatively, if anyone has recommendations for apartments that fit the above requirements and are reasonably priced, I would greatly appreciate it🙏",0,1759635036.0,eastbay,1,0.36,False

I have a fetish.” 
I told him that was weird word choice and he replied back with “I’m just trying to be politically correct with you kids”

A few days later at dinner, my dad (55M, a new grandpa) brought up how there was a baby at the brewery the day before. Just a few weeks older than his grandboy and how his grandkid would be all big happy smiles like that soon too (was the only baby in the vicinity)

To which my uncle replied “wasn’t that mom breast feeding there in the beginning?” 

Again, I said “that’s a weird fact to bring up. But okay”
Randy: how is that weird? It’s just a fact. She was!
Me: but for that to be the thing you focused on and brought up?
Randy: it’s a natural thing! I can talk about it!

CHAPTER ONE

Stiffed again. Christmas Jones removed the empty coffee mug and pie plate from the table, grumbling under her breath. She hated the holidays. New York City attracted more tourists in the weeks leading up to Christmas. For retailers, it was a blessing. For Frankie’s Diner, it was a curse. For Chris, it meant getting stiffed on tips by chintzy tourists who figured they could get away with being jerks. Her regulars still came by, but usually less often to avoid the crowds or to spend time with loved ones. This meant she had to hustle twice as hard to earn her usual income in order to pay exorbitant rent on a shoebox apartment. It also meant she was not in the mood for Frankie’s annual holiday joke.

“Hey, kid,” he said, turning up the antique radio on the counter. “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas.” He sang the tune, a big smile on his wrinkled face. His serenading failed to pull her from her foul mood. Frankie DeSanti sighed. At sixty-nine, he’d owned and run Frankie’s Diner in Brooklyn for thirty years. Before him, it was Ernie’s Place, owned by Frankie’s uncle Ernie Russo. Ernie never had any children. When he died, he left the diner to Frankie who renamed it, but kept the same menu to honor his uncle. Italian and American comfort foods were served along with the best coffee in the neighborhood and, local legendary baker, Miss Evangeline’s homemade pies.

Chris deposited the dirty dishes in the kitchen. Big Mike picked them up and placed them in the sink, washing away the food debris. He’d been with Frankie for twenty of his thirty years of business, quietly washing the dishes every day. Chris couldn’t even remember a day in the three years she’d worked here when Big Mike wasn’t in the kitchen scrubbing food off plates and forks and knives. He always wore yellow rubber gloves and a green bandana tied around his balding head. A few wisps of gray hair poked out around his large ears, but she’d never seen him without his head covered. He didn’t speak much either, but he wasn’t mute. If Big Mike had something to say, a person ought to listen. He observed everything, never missing a detail; a fact realized when he did open his mouth. Because his words were so few, they carried a lot of weight, and he only shared them when he felt it was important.

Now was not one of those times. Chris returned to the front. In addition to the booths, the diner had an old-fashioned counter with a row of barstools riveted to the floor. A man sat at the end of the row sipping coffee. He’d been in every day over the past two weeks. He sat in the same spot and ordered the same thing; a cup of coffee and a slice of hot apple pie. He had a rough look about him, like a life hard lived. Dingy gray strands mingled with his dark hair. He needed a haircut, but it was the scar on his right cheek that stood out. The jagged cut zig-zagged over his cheekbone off into his hairline. The skin around it was puckered like it hadn’t healed properly. It looked painful. Besides the scar, old tattoos littered his hands continuing up under the sleeves of his black leather jacket. Prison tats, she guessed. The only jewelry he wore was a gold crucifix around his neck.

She normally wouldn’t have noticed so much about a customer, especially a new one, but this man creeped her out. It wasn’t his tattoos or even his scary scar. It was the way he looked at her. She’d felt his eyes on her every time he came in, but when she turned to look his way, he was always staring down at his plate or his coffee cup. She mentioned it to Big Mike after the third day. He looked out through the pass-through from the kitchen, observing the man a moment, and then shrugged. Chris figured if Big Mike didn’t notice anything off about the strange man, then she shouldn’t worry about him either. It was good advice, so why did she still feel creeped out?

Customers coming through the door pulled Chris’s attention away from the creepy man. A gust of cold wind followed a small group of people inside. They waited to be seated before noticing the sign that read “Seat Yourself.”

*Tourists*, she thought, shaking her head. Another man came in behind them. He noticed the sign right away. Chris noticed him.

He looked like Captain America. Tall, dark blond, and broad-shouldered. He had the face of a model, but the haircut and bearing of a military man. He looked around the crowded interior before deciding on a stool at the counter. There were only three left. He chose the empty one two seats over from the creep. Shrugging out of his leather jacket, he placed it over the back of the stool, and dropped a military duffel bag on the open seat to the right.

Chris noticed the size of his arms beneath the thermal weave of his black Henley. He obviously worked out. She sighed, appreciating the eye candy he provided. Not that a guy like that would ever notice her, but maybe her day was about to improve. She pulled the pad out of her apron pocket and walked his way.

“Welcome to Frankie’s. What can I get for you?”

The handsome man scanned the menu on the wall, then answered, “Coffee, black, and a slice of Miss Evangeline’s lemon meringue pie please.”

Surprised, Chris asked, “You know Miss Evangeline?” Most people didn’t notice where the pies came from, only the variety.

He looked up, his eyes taking her in. Chris noticed they were as blue as the ocean, fringed in dark lashes.

The man gave her a quick once-over lingering a half-second longer than necessary on her breasts before locking eyes. He smiled and Chris felt her cheeks warm.

“Of course. I grew up on Miss E’s pies. She’s the best.”

“You’re from here? I’ve never seen you before,” she said.

“Been overseas the past few years. This is the first trip home I’ve had in a while.” He extended his hand. “Shane McCall.”

She hesitated, then placed her hand in his. It was warm but rough, his grip firm. “Chris Jones. Military?”

“Yes ma’am,” he said. Her stomach did a happy flip. “U.S. Army Green Beret.”

“Sounds intense. What do you do in the army?”

He grinned. “Whatever my commanders tell me, ma’am.” Shane gave the usual reply.

Chris knew he was messing with her. She shook her head, a half-smile on her lips. “Well, Shane, welcome home. I’ll get your order right out to you.”

“Thank you, ma’am,” he said, watching her leave, an appreciative smile on his handsome face.

Chris felt his eyes on her and blushed. It was a good thing he couldn’t see her face. She reached up to grab a coffee mug and filled it to the rim. Then, she plated a thick slice of lemon meringue pie, just a bit larger than a normal slice, and carried them both back to the good-looking soldier. It wasn’t everyday she encountered such a gorgeous man. Heck, it wasn’t even every month. She hadn’t dated at all in over a year, blaming her work schedule. She worked as many hours as Frankie would allow overtime trying to make ends meet. That left no time in between for a personal life. At least, that’s what she told herself. It was easier than facing the fact that men didn’t usually pay her any attention. They liked her well enough, but apparently not enough to ask her out. She tried not to dwell on it, but now and again, old wounds reopened reminding her she wasn’t any man’s first choice. Still, feeling Captain America’s blue eyes upon her reminded her of what she’d been missing. She told herself he was just playing around and not being serious at all.

“One coffee, black, and one big slice of Miss Evangeline’s lemon meringue pie as ordered.” She set the items down in front of him. “There’s sugar and cream here if you need them,” she added, pointing to the carousel on the counter.

“Christmas Jones?”

A man wearing a long Navy-blue coat over a dark suit approached. He was mid-fifties, dark-haired, and resembled a character from a Godfather movie.

“Yes?” she replied, surprised. She had no idea who this man was or how he knew her full name. Other than Frankie and Big Mike, no one else in the diner knew her first name was Christmas.

He pulled an envelope from the inside breast pocket of his jacket. It was a thick, cream-colored vellum and looked official. “This is for you.” He pulled out a card adding it to the envelope which he handed over. “If you have any questions, call the number on the card.” He turned to leave.

“Wait! What’s this about? Am I in trouble?” She had no idea what was going on.

He glanced over his shoulder. “All I know is that envelope is for Christmas Jones. You’re Christmas Jones. Any questions, call the number on the card. Good day, miss.” He left her standing there holding the official-looking cream-colored envelope.

Chris stared at it like it was a snake that might bite. Her name was typed on the outside along with the hand-written words, “To be opened on your twenty-fifth birthday.” Her birthday was tomorrow. December the 8^(th). She had no idea who it was from or what it was about. She glanced at the card. The name Leo Profacci was embossed in gold lettering. Beneath the name it read *Attorney at Law*. But it didn’t say for whom or for which firm. There was a phone number and nothing else.

“Everything okay?”

Chris looked at the soldier. She shrugged. “I don’t know. I don’t know what that was about,” she said, putting the envelope into the pocket of the apron tied around her waist. Reaching up, she tightened her ponytail and then tugged the hem of her blue sweater down over her jeans.

He pointed at her pocket with his fork. “Then I suspect you’ll find the answers inside that envelope.”

“Yeah, I guess so.” Absently, Chris reached for her necklace. It was a silver medallion with a blue enamel rendering of the Virgin Mary. She rubbed it with her thumb, her thoughts all over the map.

He watched her. “So, Christmas, is it?”

“What?” she refocused her attention outward. “Oh, yeah.”

“Your parents big fans of the holiday or something?”

She stiffened, dropping the necklace back down into her shirt. “I don’t know. The nuns named me. I was found on their doorstep on Christmas morning.”

Shane McCall put down his fork. Quietly, he said, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have pried.”

“It’s okay—”

The creepy man with the hideous scar lunged across the counter reaching for her neck.

Chris screamed, falling backwards as hands clawed at her throat.

“Give me that!” he shouted. The man pushed Chris against the wall.

Strong arms reached out grabbing the creepy man, yanking him off Chris before throwing him bodily over the counter. The creep landed hard rolling into the legs of an occupied booth. The loud crash sent customers scattering out of the way. Shane jumped over the counter going after the man who got up and ran for the door. He knocked customers out of the way, scrambling through the crowd. Once he gained the street, he took off running.

Shane watched him go, ready to pursue the man but he remembered the young woman. Turning, he spotted her. She was holding her throat, tears welling in her big, brown eyes. A large man wearing a green bandana came running out of the kitchen followed by an older man limping behind him.

All three rushed to her side.

“Are you okay?” Shane put his arm around Chris and helped her around the counter to a stool.

“Chris, sweetie,” said the older man, “what the hell happened?” He looked at her and then at Shane. “What are you doing here?”

“Frankie, good to see you. Big Mike,” said Shane, looking at the big man. “can we save the reunion until we see to your employee?”

Big Mike nodded, a world of concern in his eyes. “Hey, kid, what happened?”

Chris tried to get her breathing under control. She was in shock and completely shaken. In all her twenty-four years, she’d never been attacked, and she lived in New York City! Her neck hurt and when she pulled her hand away, there was blood on her fingers. Shallow scratches from the creepy man’s fingernails had drawn blood. She reached for her necklace automatically. It was still there. Relief flooded her. The necklace was all she had, the only link to her birth mother. She didn’t know her, didn’t even know her name. All she knew was her mother died in childbirth and someone had left the baby at the doorstep of the St. Agnes orphanage on Christmas morning. The information was scarce and the necklace merely a small token, but it was all she had, and that creepy man had tried to take it from her. Why?

“I don’t know. He just attacked me out of nowhere. I knew there was something off about him!” She threw an accusing look at Big Mike.

The big man nodded. “Yeah, but looking *off* isn’t a crime.”

“Attacking a woman *is* a crime. Frankie,” said Shane. “You need to call the police, file a report. I’ll be a witness.”

Frankie nodded and reached out, patting Chris’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry, kid. Here,” he handed her a towel for her neck, “for the bleeding.”

Shane took it. “Best to wait on that, Frankie. The police will need to collect any DNA evidence left behind. Sorry, ma’am,” he apologized. “It’s all they’ll have besides a description of him and an eye-witness account.” He looked around at the corners of the diner. “I guess you still haven’t put in security cameras, Frankie?”

The old man shook his head. “Never needed them before. Guess it’s time. Damn shame what the world is coming to,” he said, shuffling off to call the police.

Big Mike silently fumed. “Been telling him we needed some security ‘round here. He lives in the past, does Frankie. Thinks people are still good and honest. He don’t know what we know, Shane.”

Chris listened to their exchange, watching in fascination as Big Mike, who rarely spoke, carried on a short, easy conversation with the handsome soldier. It was obvious Big Mike and Frankie knew him, but at that moment, she was just thankful he was there to pull the creepy man off her. She shuddered to think what would’ve happened otherwise.

“Thank you, Shane.”

McCall looked at her. She was a beautiful young woman with dark brown, curly hair and olive-toned skin. He couldn’t quite pin if she was African-American, Puerto Rican or Italian or some mix in between, but whatever she was, she was stunning. Her skin glowed. She had high cheekbones and full lips that stretched into a gorgeous smile. He’d noticed her right away and admitted to himself he’d checked her out as she went about her duties pouring coffee and serving up his delicious dessert. Even so, he didn’t think the crazy, creepy man had attacked her out of misguided lust.

“He wanted your necklace,” he said, looking at the vee of her blue sweater.

“What?” She glanced down at the silver chain.

“He said, “Give me that!” when he attacked you. He was reaching for your necklace. Any idea why? Do you know him or recognize him from anywhere?”

“No. He just started coming around two weeks ago. I told Big Mike he creeped me out, but other than staring, he hadn’t said or done anything until today. But why now?”

Shane shrugged, trying to put two and two together. As an interrogator at Black Site Alpha, Kuwait, he was used to forcing information out of unwilling terrorists. This was different. Christmas Jones was a victim, not a perpetrator, and she’d been the one attacked. He softened his tone. “Do you think maybe it might have to do with that envelope in your pocket? That man attacked you immediately after you received it. Maybe it wasn’t your necklace, but the envelope he was after.”

“What envelope?” Frankie joined them once again.

Big Mike watched the exchange between Chris and Shane, curious.

Chris shrugged. “I have no idea. I don’t even know what’s in it.” She pulled it out.

“Then open it, for Christ’s sakes,” said Frankie.

“It says to only open it on my birthday. That’s not until after midnight.” She knew that sounded lame. Who was going to stop her? The envelope police?

Shane’s eyebrows quirked. “It’s your call, but the police are going to have all kinds of questions. It’s best if you can give them something solid to go on. Otherwise, that man will most likely show up again.”

The very idea scared the bejesus out of her. Chris nodded and eyed the envelope. Taking a deep breath, she opened it.

it might sound pointless to some people.
But when that thought is tied with a purpose... it becomes something powerful.
Powerful enough to push you through that first rough phase of life... that starting distance.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately.
I’m not doing this just for money... I’m doing this to see...
what if.
What if in my case... it actually works.

Tell me honestly... if you want something badly enough... like it’s in your dreams... your deep heart wish...
can you skip a coffee for it? ☕
Like literally... can you skip your evening snack... your mid-day chai...
and instead put that small amount towards that dream?

There have been so many ideas like this before...
“No Shave November” is one... right?
Small concept... but big purpose behind it.
That’s what I’m talking about.
Use that money... or time... or whatever resource you’ve got...
to start something that actually matters.

I’ve always dreamt of earning big... not just 1 crore or something within reach...
I’m talking big-big... like 100 crore+.
Crazy, I know. But it’s possible.

And no... not just to flex.
But to build something sustainable... something that helps.

A business that powers rescue.
That powers human emotion.
Adoption... companionship... loneliness care... all of it.

I’ve read so many success stories of people and businesses that support stray animals... nature... communities.

I even tried once... couldn’t scale it up.

( A proper business startup of mine which in turn profited and powered animals in need).
But I know... I can’t do this alone.

Just imagine...
every time you shop online... or buy a car...
there’s a small component added... just like GST...
but this one goes towards nature... animals... sustainable growth.

Not as a donation.
But as a commitment tax.

Some people can give time...
Some can give money...
Some can give resources...
Everyone gives something.

That’s how it grows.
That’s how it blooms 🌱.

Our cities... they’re beautiful...
but at the same time, if you look close enough... they also look like wastelands.
So much suffering... so much mismanagement...

Imagine if we change that.

Every weekend... people committing something.
An auto driver giving what he can...
A businessman contributing based on his capacity...
A small fixed amount... maybe ₹10 per week from every working person...
That’s all it takes to start.

Or maybe... businesses that are built to 100% fund shelters.
So when the business grows... the shelters grow too.

People taking accountability...
not just for themselves...
but for the animals on their streets... for the world they live in.

It’s not charity... it’s sustainability.
It’s not about doing something huge today...
It’s about starting something small...
and letting it grow.

I turned around to see what's going on, only to face a sight that made me feel sick to my stomach.

My biker Wolf and Susan were k1ssing.

The sight of it seared in my brain, his hands gripping her arms like he wanted to throw her over the bar and take her right there, her slim body pressed hard against his.

""Are you okay?"" Tammy's voice pulled me back, her hand light on my arm.

""I'm sorry you had to see that."" She was trying to be kind, but her words were like daggers to my heart. ""But now she's pregnant, they need to be together for real, be a family.""

Susan's pregnant?

I couldn't take it anymore. I turned on the spot, running for the emergency exit, feeling like I was going to throw up.

The cool night air hit me, and I took deep, desperate breaths, gulping air into my lungs to try to hold back the wall of hysteria rising within me.

Get away. That’s all I could think.

Get out of here. Get out of their lives. I kept walking and didn't look back.

Harper

The run-down house is past its prime. The paint's peeling, there's a hole in the front porch, and the porch swing hangs crooked. My concerns about the neighborhood are eased slightly as I spot some kids roaming the streets and signs that families live here-bicycles discarded on front lawns, swings in yards, and well-tended flowerbeds. Perhaps this won't be such a bad place for Jenny to grow up after all.

Although our new home is in dire need of some TLC, and it's not the nicest neighborhood, I couldn't be happier to move in. It's ours, our fresh start. Hopefully, the last one we'll ever need. I'm tired of starting over.

As we pull into the driveway, I notice three gleaming, impressively large motorbikes parked outside our new neighbor's house. No kids in that household, I'll bet.

""Jenny, we're here, honey,"" I say, gently waking my five-year-old.

She blinks awake, adorably rubbing her eyes as she comes to before taking in the scene. No doubt, she'll kick up a fuss when I try to remove the ivy that's taking over the side of the house.

""We're going to live here?"" she says gleefully.

I wish I could see the world through her eyes, where everything is magical. How she can look at this place and see anything other than a house that has remained unoccupied for years and feel wonder is beyond me. I suppose it is a step up from the small apartment we lived in before. To Jenny, the overgrown yard, knotted with weeds, is reminiscent of a fairytale, where the enchanted house slumbers, awaiting the prince. I don't have the heart to tell her that it doesn't work like that in real life; Prince Charming isn't going to come and save the day. It's just me and Jenny.

I hope I can be enough for her.

""We sure are, kiddo. Now, come help Mommy with the boxes,"" I say, climbing out of the truck and heading to the back to unload.

I'm grateful for my old, faithful truck. It managed to make it here without breaking down, and I was able to cram all of our belongings into it, so I didn't need to spend what little money I have left on renting a van.

I hand Jenny one of the lighter boxes filled with her toys and pick up a couple of heavier ones marked 'kitchen,' grunting slightly under the weight. Jenny rushes up the driveway, and I call out for her to be careful as she climbs the porch steps. I unlock the door, and we step inside our new home.

The house has an unlived-in, musty smell, and I start by opening the windows. It is almost dark; the journey took longer than expected, as Jenny had to stop frequently for the toilet. Soon, critters will make their way in, but I can air the place for a short while. Thankfully, the house is already furnished with the essentials, so I hope it won't take too long to unpack the rest of our stuff.

I head into the kitchen, placing the boxes on the countertop. Jenny follows behind me, clutching her box to her chest. ""Where does this box go, Mommy?""

""Your room. Shall we go pick which one you want?""

Her eyes light up with glee at the prospect, and she vigorously nods, too excited to speak. I take her box from her, and she sprints up the stairs, which creak in protest, and waits for me at the top. I've only seen photos of the place; it was too far to come to view it, but Jenny picks the room I anticipated would be hers. I take the main bedroom at the front of the house, and Jenny takes the one next to it. Then, there's the bathroom, and at the back is a small box room that overlooks the overgrown backyard. I plan to turn it into a home office.

I leave Jenny in her room, happily unpacking her things-which no doubt involves more playing than actual sorting-and continue to unload the truck. I ruefully notice that the bikes next door have gone. Presumably, the owner must have moved them into the garage. I'm annoyed that I missed the opportunity to catch a glimpse of my new neighbor. I wonder what kind of person owns three expensive motorcycles but still lives in this neighborhood. I envision an older gentleman who barely rides them but enjoys washing them in the yard every Sunday after church-a hobby, much like those who collect classic cars.

Hours later, having unloaded the truck, many of the boxes are still unpacked, as I've realized that, despite the rental agent's promise that the house would be cleaned, the kitchen still needs a thorough scrub. Rubber gloves on, I'm elbow-deep in a cupboard, standing on a chair, scrubbing away years of grime, when Jenny appears. ""Mommy, I'm hungry,"" she whines.

Startled, I bash my head on the cupboard. Rubbing my head, I climb down from the chair. I realize then how dark it is outside. I lost track of time; it's almost nine o'clock, past Jenny's bedtime, and well past dinner. Guilt and shame flood me for forgetting such a simple task as a mother.

""Sorry, sweetie, of course you are. Let's order pizza, shall we? A special treat,"" I offer, trying to ease my guilt.

""Yay!"" Jenny cries, unbothered by my terrible parenting. At five, being allowed to stay up late and eat pizza is a rare occurrence, and she's thrilled by it. ""Can we get barbeque chicken?"" she pleads.

At this point, I'd say yes to anything she asked, even though I'm already mentally calculating how much cash I have in my purse.

""Okay,"" I concede. ""But it's straight to bed after; it's well past your bedtime.""

I order the pizza, and while we wait, I rush around, closing all of the windows before getting Jenny ready for bed. I notice that there are several motorbikes parked outside, and the sounds of music and laughter drift over from the neighbor. It seems they're having a party.

An hour later, having eaten and put Jenny to bed, I collapse onto the couch, exhausted. I don't have the energy to unpack any more boxes. I mindlessly scroll through the TV channels, not settling on anything in particular. The party next door seems to be getting rowdier, and I glance at the stairs, concerned that they might wake Jenny. I'm so tired that I soon fall asleep on the couch. However, my peace is broken only a short while later by Jenny crying out for me. I notice that the party has only gotten louder.

With a frown, I head upstairs to comfort my child. The pungent smell of vomit hits me as I enter the room, and I notice she's thrown up on the floor. I rush over, panicked.

""Oh, sweetie, it's okay, Mommy's here.""

""I have a tummy ache,"" she moans.

I touch her forehead, relieved to find that she hasn't got a fever. It must be food poisoning from the pizza. I didn't eat much, and I mostly picked the chicken off. Jenny has always had a sensitive stomach, unlike me, who can eat almost anything without getting sick.

By the time I get Jenny cleaned up and settled in my bed with me, it's gone midnight, and the party is showing no signs of abating. I toss and turn, unable to sleep. Thankfully, Jenny is soundly sleeping beside me. I try to convince myself that this is just a one-off and the neighbors won't be doing this all the time, and I don't want to fall out with them on our first night, so I decide not to go over and ask them to keep it down.

However, when I'm still wide awake at two, I hear the unmistakable sounds of a couple having noisy s-x outside. I climb from my bed to peer out of the window into the neighbor's backyard, and my suspicions are confirmed when I see a threes0me taking place in the hot tub. I'm no prude, but I decide enough is enough; what if they were to wake Jenny and she saw? The realtor assured me that, while this wasn't the most affluent neighborhood, it was a safe and family-friendly one. If I don't say something about the noise now, what's to stop them from throwing parties like this every night? I'll be da-ned if I'm forced out of another home. I won't let people walk over me anymore.

Checking that Jenny is okay and still sleeping, I storm over to bang on the neighbor's door. By the time I get there, I've worked myself into a frenzy, and I'm livid. When there's no answer, I rap my fist against the door so hard it might leave a bruise. Finally, someone hears me, and the door opens.

An older man with a beer belly answers. Before he can speak, I launch into my tirade, explaining how I'm his new neighbor and the noise level is unacceptable when I have a sick child next door.

""Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady, slow down. This ain't my house. You're gonna have to speak to Wolf.""

""Fine, where is he?"" I ask, barging my way inside.

""He's sittin' over there.""

The man points to the living room, which looks more like a bar, complete with a pool table and a real bar. The room is packed with half-nak-d, gyrating bodies, the music deafeningly loud. I shove my way through, focused solely on my mission.

I'm momentarily thrown off my stride as I encounter the s-xiest man I've ever seen in the flesh. Dark hair with a smattering of silver at the temples that only makes him look hotter, a well-trimmed beard that frames his chiseled jawline, and piercing gray eyes. Those eyes lock onto me, and I freeze like prey, caught in the sights of a hunter. Unsurprisingly, he has a large tattoo of a wolf on his arm; whoever did it was obviously talented, as the detail is incredible and it is hauntingly beautiful.

He's sat in an armchair, but it may as well be a throne. I didn't need to ask which one was him; his presence is so commanding that it could only be him. He sits like a king at court, watching over his subjects with mild amusement. I can see why he's called Wolf; he has the wild energy and cool, focused gaze of one.

Shaking myself free of the spell he's put on me, I remind myself that, while he's hot, he's still an assh0le who throws loud s-x parties without a care for his neighbors. I stamp over to him.

""Are you Wolf?"" I demand, hands on hips.

""I am. Who are you?"" he replies, his voice commanding and clear.

""Harper, your new neighbor.""

""Let me guess, you've come to ask me to keep the noise down?""

His bored, mildly amused tone tells me I'm not the first neighbor to ask this, and that he thinks I won't be the last. If I'd had any say in where I lived, then this would be the last place I'd have picked. I wonder how many people have been driven out of their home because of this man?

""Yes. My daughter's sick, and I don't think it's too much to ask for you to keep the music down and not allow people to have s-x in your backyard!"" My voice trails off to a squeak of embarrassment at the end, and my cheeks flush.

He smiles slowly. ""And you enjoyed watching a little too much for your liking? Or perhaps you came over to join?""

His gaze explores my body, and for the first time, I realize that, in my rage, I've come over here wearing only my pajamas, which just so happen to be the least s-xy pair I own-a big baggy t-shirt from some cringey boy band I loved when I was younger, I got it at the first concert I ever went to back when I was a teen, and a hundred pounds heavier, and a pair of faded, too tight shorts. I shouldn't care how I look; it's not like I'm trying to impress this assh0le, I try to tell myself, but it's of little comfort. I'm still mortified. I'd rather Wolf and his pals think I'm the super-hot new neighbor than the crazy one. Perhaps I'm just imagining it, but his offer sure seems flirty. Almost as if he's inviting me to do it with him. I stop my thoughts from going down that road. He might be hot, but he's still an assh0le. I'm supposed to be done with assh0les.

""This isn't a f-cking porno, assh0le,"" I snap.

He chuckles, as if he finds my anger amusing. He rises from his chair, and I try not to ogle as I get a good look at his toned physique through the tight shirt he's wearing. He towers over me, a giant of a man, at least six-three. ""This is our territory, sweetheart. Has been for over twenty years. So why should I do a thing you ask, when you've been here all of five minutes?""

""I don't care if you've been here since the f-cking Stone Age; it doesn't mean you can't show some common respect and decency!"" I square up to him, refusing to let him intimidate me. I had enough of that sh1t with my ex, and I'm tired of being a pushover and treated like I'm weak.

Those smoldering gray eyes search mine with nak-d curiosity before he nods, almost imperceptibly. ""Bear, Hawk, go tell the randy f-ckers in the tub to take their party someplace else,"" he commands.

Two men, presumably Bear and Hawk, step forward. They're equally as hot, but in totally different ways to their leader. I can't believe I didn't notice them before.

The one who has to be Bear is even taller than Wolf, six-five, and at least two hundred and fifty pounds of pure muscle. He has a big bushy beard and a shaved head. His arm is tattooed with a full sleeve of what appear to be Norse symbols. You'd expect that, given his appearance, he'd be terrifying, yet somehow, he reminds me more of a cuddly bear than a wild one. Perhaps it's his kind brown eyes that meet mine as he offers me a slight, apologetic shrug, the trace of a smile dancing across his face.

Hawk is the total opposite of his companion. He's the shortest of the three but still stands over six feet. He has a tattoo of his namesake on his chest. I know this because he's wearing his leather vest with nothing underneath, revealing washboard abs. His lean, broad-shouldered physique reminds me of a swimmer. He has inky black hair that falls just above his shoulders, looking so shiny that one could almost describe it as feminine. That's if he didn't radiate a kind of lethal energy that makes me suspect he's the most deadly of the group. He surveys me with intense green eyes before turning his attention to Wolf, the clear leader.

""Got it, Prez,"" Bear agrees, his voice deep and booming, yet friendly at the same time. ""Nice to meet you, neighbor,"" he adds cheerfully, grinning at me before leaving the room with Hawk wordlessly following. I'm not sure if he's being genuine or sarcastic.

I turn my attention back to Wolf. He might have conceded to my one demand, but I'm not giving in that easily. ""I'm not leaving until you turn down the music,"" I say, folding my arms across my chest.

""Tempting,"" he purrs, and my cheeks flush all over again. ""Though, of course, you have a sick kid to get home to,"" he reminds me.

He's got a point. I've already been gone too long. What if Jenny wakes and finds me gone?

The worry must be written across my face as he takes pity on me and stops taunting me. ""Alright, everyone, party's over.""

To my surprise, almost immediately, everyone does as they're told and leaves. The only remaining stragglers are a few scantily dressed women, no doubt hoping to hang around and try to hook up with the guys.

""Thank you,"" I say through gritted teeth. I shouldn't have to thank him for doing the bare minimum most neighbors manage, but I don't want a feud.

He shrugs. ""Party was getting boring anyway, until you walked in,"" he says, fixing me with that intense gaze, and my legs feel weak. But then he adds, ""Don't expect us to start acting like Boy Scouts just because you didn't do your research before you moved in."" And I'm reminded of why I don't like him.

""Don't expect me not to call the police next time if you can't follow the law,"" I reply, smiling sweetly as I turn on my heel and, with all the integrity I can muster in my ratty pajamas, storm out.

To my relief, Jenny is still fast asleep when I return. I peek out the window at the now quiet house, and I feel a strange sense of triumph and relief when I notice the women who were lingering at the end are finally leaving, too. With the room now silent, sleep should come easily, and yet it doesn't. My turbulent thoughts are now filled with the three handsome strangers who live next door.

Wolf

Ever since she came marching into our house last night like an avenging angel, all fire and brimstone, I can't stop thinking about our new neighbor, Harper. She's a fierce lioness if I ever saw one. We only spoke for a moment, but I can already tell she'd do anything for her daughter. Lucky kid.

Her protectiveness only made her s-xier because she is s-xy, though I don't doubt that if you tried to tell her, she'd deny it. I could see the signs as clear as day that someone almost managed to douse her fire and made her feel less than the goddess that she is. I'm fascinated by her already. I want to know everything. But I also have a reputation to uphold. I can't let her blatant disrespect toward me go unpunished.

As with all the previous tenants, we start with a small, yet clear warning. In the early hours of the morning, while she was sleeping, we messed up her front lawn a little with our bikes and left them parked there. The message is clear-this is our turf.

Hawk and I are watching out of the front window in anticipation of her reaction when we hear Bear stomping down the stairs. ""She up yet?"" he asks with a yawn.

""Not yet,"" Hawk mutters, not looking around.

""Hey, make us some coffee, will you?"" I say, turning to Bear. ""Ugh. Put a shirt on. Nobody needs to see your hairy chest this early.""

""I thought Harper might. Figured I'd give her a front row ticket to the gun show,"" he says with a wink.

So it's not just me who's intrigued by our hot new neighbor. I shouldn't be surprised. We usually have the same taste in women. If you ask me, I can't think of a single man who wouldn't find Harper attractive.

Bear returns with our coffee just as the front door opens and Harper comes tearing outside, no doubt to confirm what she saw from her window. She's changed out of her pajamas into a simple white t-shirt and denim cut-offs, which hug her curves in all the right places. I allow myself to wonder if this skimpy outfit is for my benefit. I could tell that the attraction was mutual.

""This should be interesting,"" I say to the others.

We all crane forward, eager to watch her reaction. I'm hoping that she'll come right over and shout at me again. I've never enjoyed pissing a woman off so much before, or being spoken back to for that matter. To my surprise, she instead heads around the back of the house. When she reappears clutching a hose, Bear is the quickest to grasp the situation and goes running outside.

It's only when she turns on the hose to full power and aims it at our bikes that I catch up with what's happening.

Hawk and I rush outside after Bear. He's already close to Harper, shouting at her to stop. Harper simply turns the hose on him, soaking his jeans through. He holds up his hands in surrender, and she turns the hose back onto the bikes again.

""Harper, stop, the pressure could damage them!"" he booms, seeming to believe that Harper doesn't know exactly what she's doing. Does he think she's just giving them a nice wash for us?

Realizing she isn't going to stop, he wrestles the hose off her, soaking her in the process, before turning it off. There's a collective intake of breath from us men as we notice her white t-shirt is now see-through; it clings to her curves-perfect breasts, the nippl-s hard and showing through the lace of her bra, soft stomach, and hips just made for grabbing onto. My co-k twitches in my pants, and I feel like a schoolboy.

""You assh0le!"" she yells at Bear, pushing her wet hair from her face as she gapes at him in shock.

""Sorry, darlin', I didn't mean to get you wet. I just had to stop you. You could have damaged the bikes,"" he explains.

""It's just water.""

""High pressure,"" Bear grits out.

""Well, you should have thought about that before you messed up my yard,"" she mutters.

I stride over. ""Annoying when your neighbors think they can come onto your property and mess things up, isn't it?"" I remark casually. She glares at me with fire in her eyes, and I can't stop myself from provoking her further. She's just too godda-ned s-xy when she's mad. ""If you think that giving us a wet t-shirt show is going to stop us from doing this, you're sorely mistaken.""

She finally notices that her shirt is transparent, and she immediately crosses her arms over herself. ""I wasn't the one who got me wet,"" she hisses.

""We'd be happy to get you wet anytime, sweetheart,"" I promise, enjoying how her cheeks flush red as she gets the insinuation. ""No need to cover up that gorgeous body.""

I'm left wondering how she would have responded to that, because, at that moment, a little girl comes running out of the house. Harper's daughter, I presume.

""You're having a water fight without me, Mommy?"" she asks as she rushes over barefoot, still wearing pink pajamas, her hair in disarray, having just gotten out of bed. I'm not a big fan of kids, but even I have to admit this one is cute.

""Sorry, sweetie, you were sleeping,"" Harper replies, ruffling her hair and taking hold of her hand. I notice the subtle way she shifts to protectively place the child just behind her. I want to yell that we'd never hurt a child. It pains me that she'd think so. ""These are our new neighbors,"" she adds.

""Hi, I'm Jenny. What are your names?"" she asks innocently, hanging off of her mother's hand.

Bear, the best out of the three of us with kids, answers. ""I'm Bear, and these are my friends Wolf and Hawk.""

Jenny wrinkles her nose and looks up at him in confusion. Tilting her head, she replies, ""Those are silly names, you're boys, not animals.""

Bear chuckles. ""You're right, they're not our real names, they're nicknames. We got them when we were in the Army. I was a medic, and these two were soldiers. My real name is Ezra, Wolf is Logan, and Hawk is Silas, but we prefer to use our nicknames.""

Jenny nods, understanding. ""Are you called Bear because you're big and hairy like one?""

This makes us all laugh. Harper scolds her daughter. ""Jenny, don't be rude!""

""No, it's okay. You're right, kiddo,"" Bear says.

She nods, pleased to have her suspicion confirmed. She turns her attention to Hawk. ""Can you fly?"" she asks in awe.

""Unfortunately, not. It's because I'm good at watching things and spotting the small details, like a hawk,"" Silas explains patiently.

""I can see why you're Wolf,"" she says, turning her focus to me.

""Why's that?"" I say, expecting her to say, because I'm the leader or something.

There's nothing like a five-year-old to humble your ego.

""Because you're so gray!"" she replies triumphantly.

Again, this makes us all laugh, even Harper, who looks ready to grab her daughter and run at any second.

""I want a nickname,"" she declares, looking at us expectantly.

""Why? You're a little lamb,"" Bear replies affectionately.

Jenny scrunches up her face, frowning and crinkling her nose in disapproval. ""That's not very scary.""

""Well, no, but you don't need to be scary because your Mommy is a lioness,"" Bear explains. When Jenny still seems unconvinced, he continues, ""Being a lamb is pretty awesome. Lambs love to play. They have lovely curly hair just like you do, and they can jump really high. I bet you can jump higher than all your friends, can you?""

She nods enthusiastically and begins hopping on the spot to show him.

""See, you're the best lamb I ever saw.""

Jenny beams at Bear, completely won over by his charm. I feel a pang of jealousy when I see the look in Harper's eyes. It seems Jenny isn't the only one Bear has impressed.

""Come on, sweetie, our new neighbors have got things to do, and you need to get dressed. Say goodbye now and go on inside,"" Harper says to Jenny.

""Bye!"" Jenny says with an enthusiastic wave before running into the house.

Harper watches her go inside before turning back to us, her former fury returns. ""Get these bikes off my lawn,"" she demands, turning on her heel and storming off.

We all watch her walk away before doing precisely that. It's only when we get inside our place that we finally talk about her.

""da-n, she is something else,"" Bear says wistfully.

""Not that she knows it,"" Hawk points out.

""She's been hurt. Someone made her hate that gorgeous body. And no one moves into that house who isn't desperate or running,"" I reply.

We've worked our way through our fair share of neighbors, driving the price down. We've been hoping to buy the place and expand our clubhouse, but the owner's been stubborn. If we can drive yet another tenant out, we think he'll finally give in. Although I'm not so sure I want to get rid of Harper now.

When Bear says, ""We can change that,"" I know that my friends are as infatuated with Harper as I am.

We collectively decide then that we want Harper to be ours.

Our lioness.

Kendu at 13 million market cap has reached unprecedented levels of IRL efforts, from energy drinks to coffee, to KenduSTREET to plushies we are literally changing the game one step at a time. Although we have over 20 IRL initiatives non are done by a ""team"" they are all done from individual community members. These are average people with full time jobs and many other responsibilities yet they still find time to push Kendu with IRL efforts which take hours upon hours of planning...

Imagine when Kendu is in the hundreds of millions and these holders are shit rich, there's gonna be a tidal wave of new efforts and this is literally gonna be impossible to keep up with. Although I am here daily I still miss many of these efforts and I have to catch up through monthly recaps😭

The monthly recap for September was absolutely insane although September is typically a very poor month for crypto, the Kendu community did not slow down, they kept innovating and revolutionising the space from Kendu NFTs to Kendu Spice, to random posts to Dutch community members, to new Kendu Energy flavours, to a Kendu radio show to Kendu Unleashed... 

Like this is literally crazy, this alone is extremely groundbreaking yet it is just another month for Kendu, we don't falter on social media efforts either.

We have:

* X efforts that rival the very best, I unfortunately cannot say that Kendu has the strongest X community simply because idk how you would measure it and I don't wanna make false statements
* Reddit efforts are simply number 1, check any crypto subreddit and you will see Kendu with far more posts and more engagement than any other coin, with also a very large subreddit
* Stocktwits, Kendu is number 1 by far, we have an insane presence and routinely win competitions
* Recently won CMC's BOOST ME COMPETITION and was one of the only projects to use no AI
* In MaestroBot's 250k Battle Royale, competing against 31 other projects on BASE
* We have TikTok efforts that are ramping up marking a new effort
* We also have an Instagram presence which gathers lots of interest from non holders

Kendu's community is that strong we are groundbreaking in both IRL and social media, which rivals the very best communities to ever come out of crypto. We are doing this at 13 million market cap, imagine what will happen as Kendu grows and we get more and more community members...

Kendu is a tidal wave waiting to happen and we are not one to miss, we are so undervalued but as we all know crypto changes so fast...

1nydh6y,https://www.sinchew.com.my/?p=6918508,"Malaysian Doctor Worked 60 Hours a Week for Only RM4,500. After Moving to Australia, Her Salary, Annual Leave, and Sick Leave All Doubled! - Sin Chew Daily","(Kuala Lumpur, Oct 4) — A Malaysian female doctor now living in Australia shared her experiences working as a doctor in both Malaysia and Australia, revealing the stark contrast between the two countries. Her story made many netizens sigh, realizing how difficult it is for Malaysia to retain talent given the working conditions.

According to the doctor’s Facebook post, she resigned from her job at a Malaysian hospital last year and moved to Australia to continue her medical career there.

She revealed that while working as a doctor in Malaysia, she worked at least 60 hours per week, often had to work overtime, and earned only RM4,500 per month, without any overtime pay.

In contrast, in Australia, her base salary for a 76-hour fortnight (two weeks) is 3,800 Australian dollars (around RM11,560). If she works on weekends, afternoon shifts, or night shifts, she receives additional allowances.

Overtime pay is calculated at 1.52 to 2.0 times the base rate, public holidays are paid at 150%, and night shifts can earn 138 AUD per hour (about RM383).

She admitted that when she was working in Malaysia, taking annual leave was nearly impossible. Requests were often denied, and even if approved, she couldn’t take more than two days per month, and had to find her own replacement before leaving.

In Australia, however, doctors are entitled to five weeks of annual leave and 28 days of sick leave per year. Moreover, if the sick leave is less than three days, no medical certificate (MC) is required.

She also shared that in Malaysia, she used to start work at 6 a.m. and only finish late at night, but in Australia, things are completely different — she usually works only two to three shifts per week, and if she works an overnight shift, she can rest for the entire following week.

**“Even Lunch Breaks Are Mandatory in Australia,” She Says**

Dr. Yeap emphasized that in Australia, taking a lunch break is mandatory — if doctors refuse to rest, they are told to take a break anyway.

She added that in Malaysia, junior and trainee doctors are often scolded and have to skip meals while working. She personally experienced being reprimanded by her supervisor for not finishing her work, even though she hadn’t eaten all day.

In Australia, however, colleagues are friendly and respectful, whether they are consultants, registrars, or interns. She said coworkers often offer coffee and help each other, creating a supportive and pleasant working environment.

Her post sparked heated discussion online. Some netizens accused her of trying to “lure” Malaysian doctors to migrate to Australia, saying she didn’t care about the Malaysian public and only complained about heavy workloads. Others, however, supported her for simply sharing her personal experience.

Many commenters agreed with her observations, saying that every individual has the right to choose a better working environment and that unfair treatment of healthcare workers in Malaysia naturally leads many to seek better opportunities overseas.

In an interview with Sin Chew Daily, Dr. Yeap clarified that her post was meant only to share her personal experience and help others understand alternative career options.

She stressed that she did not intend to encourage Malaysian doctors to quit their jobs or move overseas, nor did she want her story to have any negative impact.",38,1759634297.0,malaysia,13,0.95,False

The Sheriff was sitting on his usual chair outside the office, the double-barrel shotgun resting across his legs. Life in town was quiet as always. Folks walked and shopped, the saloon was busy. The small settlement was known as the safest town in the territory. For years, no serious crime had happened—not because of the Sheriff's grit, but because most residents were War Veterans: sharpshooters, law-abiding, and watchful. In truth, the Sheriff was the most useless man in town. No outlaw dared come near. Even the bank had no guard.
The Sheriff was lost in thought, a heavy feeling in his gut. Twenty years a Sheriff, and now he heard the whispers about being replaced. Twenty years of service without a single notable incident or badge of honor. He’d have to go home, till the earth, and feed the cows. Inside his office, the walls displayed pictures of famous sheriffs, their deputies, and the outlaws' bodies in coffins. He had no place on that wall. Tomorrow, and the days after, it would be the chair, the gun, and the same damn thoughts. But the final blow was the Mayor’s look and his cutting greeting: ""Sheriff, we’ll likely need to have a serious talk in my office in the next few days.""
""No,"" he muttered to himself, ""it can't end this way... I have to do something.""
That night, he called his Deputy, telling him he had to leave town early to visit his sick brother. The next morning, the Sheriff packed provisions, saddled his horse, and rode out. Five hours later, he found Uncle Johnny’s cabin at the bottom of a hill. He hadn't seen the old man in years and hoped he was still alive. The smoke rising from the chimney gave him some hope. As he approached, the stench of rotting animal carcasses and skins hanging on ropes confirmed it. He approached with caution and called out. A moment later, a tall man with a long white beard and a rifle appeared in the doorway. Johnny recognized the Sheriff, lowered his gun, and invited him in. He poured bitter coffee into a dented metal cup and handed it over, asking: ""What brings you, Sheriff? Coming to finally arrest me? You know I’ve been clean for years, truth is, I don’t have the strength for that life anymore.""
The Sheriff, choking on the stench of the hides and the old man, said: ""No, Uncle. Just had a sudden thought of you yesterday. Came for a visit. I see you’re still in the trapping business."" He laughed, adding: ""Heard you don't even pass up a dead critter's hide in the desert. Aren't you tired of all this filth? Truth is, I have a great job offer for you. An easy, clean job that will change both our lives.""
Uncle Johnny asked: ""What job? I can't do hard labor. There's no gold around here, all the mines are dead.""
The Sheriff said: ""No, the gold I'm talking about has no mine. You just have to reach out and take it. Simple as that."" Johnny’s eyes narrowed: ""Then why don't you take it yourself?""
The Sheriff explained: ""Look, Uncle, I'm the Sheriff. And you know our town is too safe. The bank has no guard. There's only a teller and a pile of money and gold coins he brings in every morning. All you need to do is walk in with a pistol at the agreed time, load the bags onto your horse, and ride out. I'll fire a few shots behind you. Then you take your share and ride off to a new town for a new life. It’s that easy.""
After half an hour, Uncle Johnny seemed convinced, saying: ""I'll think about it."" The Sheriff pushed his advantage: ""We don't have much time. I'll be waiting for you at 8 AM sharp on Monday. If you show, I’ll signal you. If you don't, you better forget everything, for your own sake. I know you have a gun. Take this money, get yourself a good horse and clothes. Take a bath and shave that beard, or they’ll know who robbed the bank just from the smell.""
An hour before the appointed time, the Sheriff picked up his rifle and walked toward the bank. He knew there wouldn't be much cash at 8 AM, as ranchers hadn't brought in their deposits yet, but that didn't matter. He was hunting for glory. He walked around. Everything was normal. He grabbed a bite at the saloon across the street and watched the bank door. The teller unlocked the door and went inside. Thirty minutes to the moment.
Eight o'clock. The old man should be here. The Sheriff checked his shotgun, ensuring it was loaded. He stepped out. Half an hour passed. No sign of the old man. Nine o'clock came and went, customers walking in and out. He was sure the old man had backed out. He was probably drinking in a saloon with the money he’d been given. The Sheriff felt regret creep in. What if the old man blabbed about their meeting?
It was ten o'clock, and the bank was emptying out. He walked toward his office, handed the rifle to the Deputy, and told him to go on his patrol. He poured himself a coffee. He was lost in thought when the sound of gunshots jolted him. He rushed out. Someone screamed: ""They robbed the bank! They robbed the bank!"" It was the last thing the teller said before collapsing on the steps, his chest bleeding. The Deputy didn't even get a shot off, falling to the ground under the fire of one of three masked riders.
The Sheriff drew his pistol, aimed, and fired. Some townsfolk immediately blocked the riders' exit with two carts. The riders fired wildly, trying to clear a path. In under two minutes, the street became a war zone. From windows, balconies, and rooftops, anyone with a gun was shooting at the riders. Several innocent people—children, old and young—fell to the ground. The Sheriff shot one of the riders' horses, but two bullets tore into his arm. Dust, horses’ neighs, and gunfire continued. One rider charged toward the saloon door, hoping to escape out the back, but the Bartender's shotgun was waiting inside, throwing him off his horse like a sack of potatoes. The second rider lay dead beside his horse, riddled with bullets. The Sheriff spotted the third, dragging himself under the wooden steps of the general store. He reached the man, blood streaming from his arm, and finished him with two shots. ""Hold your fire! It's over! It's over!"" he yelled.
The gunfire stopped, and the dust settled. People screamed, rushing toward the bodies of loved ones. The town was stunned. The Sheriff had lost an arm, but he had finally found his glory.
Two months later, the one-armed Sheriff sat in his office. A picture of him was on the wall, next to one of his slain Deputy. The door opened. A tall old man, who no longer smelled foul, walked in and said hello.
The Sheriff asked, simply: ""Why, Uncle? Why?""
The old man said: ""I’m truly sorry, Sheriff. Things didn’t go as planned.""
The Sheriff asked again: ""Why?""
The old man replied: ""Well, you see, Sheriff, they call me crazy, but I’m smart enough to know to hire the right people for the job. Even if it didn't work out... Look, you got crippled, but you finally made a name for yourself and you don't have to worry about your future. But me? I have nothing. And I lost three good friends. That’s why I came to you for help. Truth is, I don’t want to go back to that shithole. You have to help me. Don’t worry, I’ll only be around for three or four more years; it will be over soon. You have to support me. I hope you understand. Of course you do.""**

I am conflicted with my feelings. I have never been in a relationship or dated before. This was my first experience going on a “date,” and while it went well and he was nice, I was filled with anxiety afterwards. I don’t know if I like him, nor do I know if I should like him at this point. We had a decent conversation, and I could see us being friends, but we didn’t necessarily have a lot in common, and just went through a lot of the conversation that you have when getting to know someone. I didn’t feel a strong sense of attraction, not that he is unattractive, but rather I didn’t feel romance. We ended on a somewhat awkward note, as we are neighbors, but basically said general goodbyes as we walked to our doors. He texted me afterwards to say he had enjoyed talking and would like to go on another date. The word date made me so anxious that I immediately called my friend. I don’t know how I should feel after one meeting. It’s not that I don’t like him, he’s a nice person and I enjoyed talking as well, but I don’t know if I like him in a romantic sense. I have only ever liked people I have been friends with, and we connected through Hinge and had only texted for a few days before meeting. Ultimately, I told him that I would like to hang out again to get to know each other better and made tentative plans to do an activity this upcoming weekend. My dilemma is that I'm honestly not sure how I should feel. Should you just know that you like someone immediately after a first date, or is it normal to be unsure if you feel a romantic connection? How many dates without feeling a connection can you go on?? When should you just call it? I don’t want to cut it off prematurely before knowing if those feelings could grow. How do you judge this?

1nyd3dm,https://youtu.be/ZPvw8UcAzvg,3 Very Scary TRUE Remote Agritourism Horror Stories,"# ""The Night Visitors"":

I booked a week at a remote farm in Nebraska after stumbling across an online ad promising “real country living.” It offered fresh air, hands-on chores, and quiet nights far from the noise of the city. The owners, John and Emily, ran it as a small agritourism venture, welcoming people like me who wanted to escape the rush.

The drive out there felt endless. My car rattled over a long dirt road carved straight through open fields that seemed to stretch into infinity, no towns or lights in sight. When I finally pulled up to the white farmhouse, paint peeling in places but neat and well-kept, John was waiting on the porch. His handshake was firm, his palms rough, his face lined from decades of work under the sun.

“Welcome,” he said in a low, steady voice. “We’ll make sure you get the full experience.”

Emily led me upstairs to the guest room. It was simple but inviting—quilted bedspread, a small dresser, a window looking out over the barn and fields. “Breakfast is at seven sharp,” she said with a smile that felt both warm and matter-of-fact. “If you’re up for it, you can collect the eggs yourself.” I nodded, eager.

That first day was like stepping into a postcard. I fed chickens, helped John repair a sagging fence, and watched the prairie sky turn copper and violet as the sun went down. Dinner was a heavy stew with fresh bread. John passed me the butter, saying, “Not many visitors this time of year. We like it that way—keeps things peaceful.”

Emily added quietly, “Just be careful walking around at night. The paths can be tricky in the dark.”

I laughed it off, assuming it was just rural caution, but the way she glanced at John lingered with me.

That night, the house was so silent it almost rang in my ears. No traffic, no distant sirens—only the soft creaks of old wood settling. I was nearly asleep when I heard a dull thump downstairs, like a door closing slowly. I sat up, straining to listen. John and Emily’s door across the hall stayed dark. Probably an animal, I told myself. Old houses and farms have sounds. But then came a faint scrape, like glass shifting against glass. My heart sped up.

I slipped to the window. Outside, the fields were pitch black, no moon, no movement. Nothing. I forced myself back under the quilt. Sleep eventually came, but it was thin, restless.

Over breakfast, Emily poured coffee and raised an eyebrow at my tired eyes. “Rough night?” she asked.

“A bit,” I admitted. “Heard some noises.”

John looked up from his plate. “Wind rattling the old windows. This house has been here since my grandfather’s time.”

We spent that day in the garden picking vegetables. Emily showed me how to spot ripe tomatoes, her fingers moving quick and sure. “You city folks miss out on this,” she teased. John joined later, telling stories about past guests who came back year after year. It eased my nerves. By sunset, I was telling myself I’d overreacted.

But as night fell again, the house seemed different—heavier, like it was holding its breath.

I left the lamp on and tried to read, but every creak in the floorboards made me jump. Around midnight, a sharp crack echoed from below—too loud, too distinct to be wind. My skin prickled. I opened the door a crack and peered into the hall. Darkness.

“John? Emily?” I whispered. No answer.

I crept to the top of the stairs. Faint voices drifted up—urgent, hushed. A man’s: “Check the rooms quick. We need cash or something worth taking.”

A girl’s reply, tense: “Shut up. Just grab what you can.”

My blood turned cold. Intruders.

I backed away, my pulse hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears. Back in my room, I locked the door—thank God there was a lock—and shoved a chair under the knob. Footsteps creaked on the stairs. I darted into the closet, crouching low and pulling hanging clothes around me.

The doorknob rattled. “This one’s locked,” the girl said.

“Break it,” the man snapped.

A thud shook the door but it held.

“Forget it,” he hissed. “Let’s find the owners first.”

Their footsteps moved down the hall.

Then John’s voice, muffled, somewhere nearby: “What do you want? We don’t have much.”

Emily’s plea: “Please, take what you need and go.”

The man’s harsh laugh: “We’ll decide that.”

A scuffle. Furniture clattering. Emily’s scream, cut off by a loud bang—like a gunshot. I clamped my hand over my mouth. Another bang. A low groan from John. Then silence.

I pressed myself deeper into the closet, shaking so hard the clothes trembled against me. Tears blurred my vision.

Downstairs now, drawers opening, metal clattering. “Got some jewelry,” the girl said.

“Not enough,” the man growled. “Check upstairs again.”

Footsteps on the stairs. My door rattled violently. “Open up!” he shouted.

I stayed still, praying. A kick splintered the wood. The door crashed inward. Light flipped on.

“Nobody here,” the girl said. “Bed’s messed up, though.”

“Heard us and ran,” the man muttered.

They searched—the bed, the drawers. The closet door creaked open inches from my face. Fabric shifted as the man moved hangers aside.

“Nothing,” he finally grunted. “Let’s get out before someone comes.”

Their footsteps receded. A car engine roared outside, gravel crunching as they sped away.

I waited what felt like hours before crawling out, legs numb, throat raw from holding back sobs. I grabbed my phone—one bar of signal—and dialed emergency.

“Help,” I whispered. “People are dead. Intruders shot them.”

I stayed upstairs until flashing lights bathed the house in red and blue. Police found John and Emily in their room. Gone. Blood everywhere.

“Did you see their faces?” an officer asked me.

I shook my head. “Only heard voices—a young man and a woman.”

Days later, two local relatives of John and Emily were arrested. One even confessed after a long interrogation. But something about it felt off.

Months passed. Then the news broke: the confession had been forced, evidence planted. The real killers were two teenagers from out of state on a drug-fueled spree with stolen guns. They’d broken in looking for easy cash. Things spiraled. The girl left behind a distinctive ring—that’s how police finally caught them. Both were sentenced to life.

I never returned to that farm. The memory of that night—the creak of the stairs, the gunshots, hiding while good people died—stayed with me.

Even now, on quiet evenings, I still check my locks twice.





# ""The Black Bear Inn"":

I’d been running on fumes for months — long hours, crowded subway rides, the constant hum of city life that never seemed to stop. By the end of August, my nerves felt frayed like old rope. On a whim, I booked a weekend at a small bed and breakfast in the hills of Maine called **The Black Bear**. The listing promised fresh air, homemade meals, and quiet nights — exactly what I thought I needed.

I arrived on a crisp Friday afternoon in early September. My car rattled over the gravel driveway, trees closing in overhead as if swallowing me from the world I knew. The old farmhouse appeared between the pines, white paint dulled by decades of weather, its red roof bright as dried blood against the dark forest. A handmade sign creaked in the breeze: *The Black Bear*.

I got out, stretching my stiff legs, and grabbed my bag. There was no sound but the wind and the faint tick of my cooling engine. No cell service either — my phone showed a blank screen. A little disquiet stirred, but I told myself that was part of the charm.

A woman answered when I knocked — Julie, the owner. She was in her sixties, with short gray hair and a warm, practiced smile. “Welcome! You must be Emily,” she said, glancing at a handwritten notebook. Her voice had a gentle rasp, like someone who’d lived many winters. “Come on in. Your room’s ready upstairs.”

Inside, the air smelled of cedar and wood smoke. She gave me the tour: a cozy living room with an enormous stone fireplace, a kitchen where breakfast would be served, and a couple of small sitting rooms lined with books, board games, and faded armchairs. It felt homey but… still. Like a house waiting for something.

“We’re not very busy this weekend,” Julie said as we climbed the creaking stairs. “Just you, a long-term boarder named James, and my helper, Christian. He’s been staying here while working at a restaurant nearby.”

My room was small but clean, with a handmade quilt and a narrow window looking out into the endless woods. No cars. No neighbors. I unpacked quickly, trying not to think about how far away I already felt from everything.

Back downstairs, I wandered into the kitchen where a man stood chopping vegetables at the counter. Christian. He was about thirty, dark-haired, with a soft voice and an expression that never quite lifted. “Hi there,” he murmured, eyes flicking up just once. “I’m making soup for dinner. Want some later?”

“Sure, that sounds great,” I said. “This place is beautiful. How long have you been here?”

“A couple months,” he muttered, focusing on the knife’s rhythm. “It’s quiet. I like quiet.”

Julie came in carrying a basket of linens. “Christian’s a great cook,” she told me. “James is our other guest. You might see him out back — he’s been fixing up the shed for me.”

The air outside felt sharp and clean, smelling faintly of pine and rain. I sat on the porch in a rocking chair, watching the shadows lengthen. A man in work clothes was bent over near the shed, hammering something. He noticed me and waved.

“New here?” he called out.

“Yes, just for the weekend,” I replied, walking closer. “I’m Emily.”

“James,” he said, shaking my hand. His grip was firm, his eyes tired. “Been renting a room here a while. Helping Julie with repairs.” He lowered his voice. “Watch out for Christian, though. Guy’s a little… off sometimes. We had words about rent yesterday.”

“Oh? What happened?”

He shrugged. “Nothing big. He thinks I owe more. Julie sorted it.” Then, with a faint smile: “Anyway, enjoy your stay.”

That evening, we all ate together in the dim dining room. Christian’s soup was rich and spicy, served with crusty bread. James told stories about his travels, laughing easily, while Christian mostly stayed silent, eyes flicking toward us like a hawk’s. Julie asked me about my life in the city, and I told her about the stress and why I’d come.

“So peaceful here,” I said.

Julie’s smile faltered just a little. “That’s what people come for. But it can get lonely, too.”

Later, I helped her with the dishes. “Christian seems… quiet,” I ventured.

“He’s reliable,” she said, drying a plate. “Keeps to himself. Good thing, with the place for sale. I’m moving soon to be with family.”

“You’re selling?”

“Time for a change,” she murmured. “My daughter Selby’s visiting tomorrow. She’s bringing a friend.”

I went to bed early. The house groaned and settled around me like a living thing. Sometime after midnight, I woke to the sound of footsteps downstairs. Slow. Heavy. Pacing. I sat up, heart quickening. After a while, the footsteps stopped. I told myself it was nothing.

Saturday morning smelled of coffee. Julie poured me a cup. “James went out early,” she said. “Christian’s around somewhere.”

I hiked a trail she’d recommended. Hours later, when I returned, the house felt wrong — too still. No sign of James’s truck.

“He mentioned errands,” Julie said, but her brow furrowed. “Odd. He usually tells me.”

Christian appeared, carrying tools from the shed. “Seen James?” Julie asked.

“No,” he said after a pause. “Maybe he left for good.”

“What do you mean?”

“Just saying. We talked yesterday. He might have moved on.”

Julie looked uneasy.

That evening Selby and her friend Cindy arrived, bringing a burst of chatter and warmth. We drank tea in the living room. Christian lingered in doorways, silent, listening. When Cindy asked about the “other guest,” Julie changed the subject.

By nightfall, the house felt smaller, its corners darker. I heard footsteps again, this time upstairs, just beyond my door.

Sunday morning, Julie’s face was pale. “James’s room is empty,” she whispered. “His things are still there. His truck’s gone. No note.”

“Should we call someone?” I asked.

“No signal. I’d have to drive to town.”

Christian came in, overhearing. “I told you, he left. Probably didn’t want to pay up.” His tone was sharp, his eyes hard. Julie stared at him. “What do you know about it?”

“Nothing,” he snapped, then forced a smile. “Sorry. I’ll look around outside.”

He left. Cindy murmured, “Something feels off.”

Later I saw him through the window, by the edge of the woods, dragging something heavy. Tools, I thought. Or hoped.

That night I couldn’t sleep. Around midnight a muffled bang shook the house — a door slamming, then another sound, sharper, like a body hitting the floor. Voices below, low and urgent.

“What are you doing?” Julie’s voice.

Christian’s reply, cold: “Stay quiet. It’s done.”

A thump. Then dragging.

I locked my door, trembling, listening as footsteps climbed the stairs, paused, then receded.

At dawn the house was silent. In the kitchen a faint red smear stained the floor, half-wiped.

“Julie?” I called softly. No answer.

Outside, Christian stood by the bushes with a shovel. When he saw me, he smiled. “Morning. Sleep okay?”

“Where’s Julie? Where’s Selby and Cindy?” I asked, voice thin.

“They left early. Family thing.”

“But their car’s still here.”

He hesitated. “I drove them to town. Car trouble.”

I knew he was lying. My heart thudded. “I heard noises last night.”

“Just me fixing things,” he said. Then, stepping closer: “You should go back inside.”

I retreated upstairs. Their rooms were empty. Beds made too neatly. A dark patch on Selby’s floor still damp.

I grabbed my keys, planning to drive out. But Christian stood at the door, blocking it. “Going somewhere?” he asked softly.

“Just for a drive,” I lied.

“Stay. I made breakfast.”

There was a bulge in his pocket.

“No thanks. I really have to go.”

His hand shot out, gripping my arm. “I said stay.”

I tore free, bolting upstairs and barring my door. His footsteps thundered after me. “Open up, Emily,” he hissed.

I climbed out the window onto the roof. The shingles were slick. I dropped to the ground, pain stabbing my ankle, and ran into the woods. Branches clawed my face.

He followed, shouting, “Come back! It’s not what you think!”

I hid behind a tree, shaking, as he prowled nearby, calling my name.

Hours later, I stumbled onto the road, flagging down a passing car. The driver took me to the police.

They found James burned miles away. Julie, Selby, and Cindy were buried in pieces behind the house. Christian confessed after his family confronted him.

I still wake up hearing those footsteps in the dark.





# ""The Mango Farm"":

I’d been backpacking across Australia for months—working in cafés, hostels, and orchards, chasing the warm weather north. My visa days were running low, and I needed more rural work to qualify for an extension. One evening, scrolling through a traveler’s Facebook group from a dingy hostel in Cairns, I saw an ad: **“Help needed—fruit picking, room and board provided. Remote Queensland farm. Immediate start.”**

It looked perfect—remote, quiet, a chance to save some money. The post had one name: *Tom*. His email reply came quickly:  
**“Come soon. Plenty of work. I’ll pick you up from the crossroads near Darr Creek. Friday morning.”**

No signature, no details. Just coordinates and that strange line—*come soon.*

When the bus dropped me off, I was the only passenger to get off. The driver looked at me like I was making a mistake. “Not much out here,” he said.  
“I know,” I smiled. “Just work.”  
He shrugged and drove off, leaving me in a cloud of dust.

Tom arrived a few minutes later in an old, sun-bleached ute that rattled like it was barely holding together. He was older than I expected—maybe mid-fifties—with tanned skin, gray stubble, and a stiff kind of silence that didn’t invite small talk.  
“You’re the one from Europe?” he asked as I climbed in.  
“Yeah. From France,” I said, trying to sound cheerful. “Thanks for picking me up.”  
He nodded once, eyes on the road. His hands gripped the wheel tight. “Long way from home.”

The bitumen gave way to gravel, then to dirt. The ride was rough, the air thick with dust and heat. The land stretched flat forever—pale grass, clusters of trees, no houses, no cars.  
“Quiet out here,” I said, mostly to fill the silence.  
“Best that way,” he answered. “No one bothers you.”

When we finally reached the farm, the sun was low and gold over the fields. The house was small and crooked, paint peeling, surrounded by dry weeds. A single windmill turned lazily in the distance. The barn’s doors hung open, shadows inside swallowing the light.

Tom led me through the back door. “Your room’s down there,” he said, pointing to a narrow hallway. “Bathroom’s at the end. Dinner at six.”

The room was little more than a cot, a small window, and a rickety dresser. Dust clung to everything. The air smelled faintly of mold and fruit gone sour. I unpacked in silence, hearing him moving around the kitchen—pots clanging, floorboards creaking.

Dinner was stew—lukewarm, bland, but filling. We sat opposite each other at a table that wobbled with every movement. He barely looked up as he ate.  
“How long have you had this place?” I asked.  
“Family farm,” he said, chewing slowly. “Wife left years ago. Kids too.”  
“Oh. I’m sorry.”  
He shrugged. “Better alone. Easier that way.”

There was something about how he said it—like solitude wasn’t a choice, but a punishment he’d come to enjoy. His eyes flicked to me once or twice, too long, too quiet. After a few strained minutes, I excused myself to shower.

The bathroom light flickered when I switched it on. The mirror was fogged with old stains, and the curtain was thin enough that I could see the vague outline of my own shadow. As I turned on the water, I heard slow footsteps outside the door. Then they stopped.

“Tom?” I called out.  
No answer.  
A moment later, a knock—three soft raps.  
“You okay in there?” His voice was muffled.  
“Yeah, I’m fine,” I said quickly, heart pounding.  
“The door sticks sometimes. I’ll check.”  
“No!” I said sharply. “It’s fine.”  
Silence, then retreating footsteps down the hall.

I finished quickly, every sound amplified by my nerves. When I stepped out, the hallway was empty, but his door was ajar, and the light was on. I thought I saw him watching me from his chair as I passed, eyes dull and heavy.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the old house made me flinch. Somewhere near midnight, I heard faint pacing in the hallway—slow, measured steps that stopped just outside my door. Then, nothing.

At dawn, he banged once on the door. “Up. Time to work.”

We picked mangoes all morning, the sun beating down mercilessly. Tom barely spoke. When he did, it was in short, dry sentences. “You work hard,” he said once. “Good girl.”  
I forced a smile, unsure how to respond.

At lunch, while sitting on the porch, he said, “Had other helpers before. Girls like you. They come and go.”  
“What happened to them?” I asked, trying to sound casual.  
He paused, staring at the horizon. “Some didn’t last. Too quiet for ‘em. One girl got scared. Over nothing.”  
“What kind of nothing?”  
“Stories,” he said. “People around here like to talk.”

That afternoon, while picking alone near the far end of the orchard, I noticed something glinting in the dirt—a silver bracelet, half-buried under a root. It had a small charm shaped like a bird. It didn’t look old, maybe lost just months ago. I slipped it into my pocket.

That evening, I offered to cook—scrambled eggs, something simple. Tom sat at the table, hands clasped, eyes unfocused. “You remind me of someone,” he said after a while.  
“Oh? Who?”  
“A girl stayed here last year. Nice like you.”  
“Did she finish the season?”  
He looked down at his plate. “She went home, I think. Stopped writing after a while.”

The way he said it made my stomach twist. I locked my door that night, though the latch was flimsy. Around midnight, I woke to a faint scratching sound at the window—deliberate, rhythmic. My phone had no signal. I lay still, barely breathing. The curtain moved slightly, like something—or someone—was brushing against it. Then it stopped.

The next morning, I pretended nothing was wrong. When Tom went to fix a fence, I told him I’d grab more baskets and slipped into the barn. It smelled of oil and old hay. In one corner, under a tarp, I found a stack of old backpacks—some faded, some newer. My heart sank. I unzipped one. Inside were clothes, toiletries, and a small notebook. The first page read:  
**“Tom watches me too much. I need to leave soon.”**

I didn’t need to read more. I dropped it, hands shaking—and that’s when I heard the door behind me creak.  
“What are you doing?” Tom’s voice was low, steady.  
I turned, forcing a smile. “Looking for a basket.”  
“You shouldn’t snoop.”  
“I wasn’t—sorry.”  
He stepped closer. His eyes were cold now, flat. “Girls who snoop get themselves in trouble.”  
“I think I should get back to work.”  
He blocked the doorway. “You like it here?”  
“It’s... fine.”  
“You could stay longer. Don’t have to leave.”  
“I have plans,” I said, backing up.  
His expression hardened. “No one leaves early.”

Something in his tone snapped my nerves. I bolted past him, ran for the house, grabbed my bag. No buses, no car, nothing but a dirt road stretching for miles. I started walking fast, then faster. The heat pressed down like a weight.

Behind me, his truck engine roared to life. He pulled up beside me, dust swirling around my legs. “Get in,” he called.  
“No,” I said. “I’m leaving.”  
“You’ll die out here. Too far to walk.”  
“I’ll take my chances.”  
He got out, eyes burning now. “Come back. We can fix this.”  
I turned and ran. He caught my sleeve, yanked hard. “Stop!”  
I twisted free, sprinting down the road, screaming. In the distance, through the shimmer of heat, I saw a small farmhouse—a figure on the porch. I screamed again, waving my arms.

Tom stopped. His jaw clenched. Then he cursed, turned, and got back in the truck. The sound of his engine faded into the hills.

When I reached the neighbor’s house, an elderly couple rushed out. The woman took one look at me and said, “You’ve been at Tom’s place, haven’t you?”  
I nodded, shaking.  
She sighed. “You’re not the first.”

The police came hours later. They questioned me gently, then one of them muttered to the other, “Same complaints. Same story. Always just out of reach.”  
Apparently, other backpackers had filed reports—harassment, missing belongings, attempted assaults—but no one ever stayed long enough for charges to stick.

I left Queensland the next day. Sometimes I still dream about that window—the scratching, the shape outside.

When people ask if I’d ever go back to Australia’s countryside, I just shake my head. There’s a kind of silence out there that feels wrong.

We had a good laugh about it but my MIL seemed genuinely confused and felt terrible she called my SIL like 6 months early. Fast forward to this weekend and my wife and I sat down to help her with some paperwork and she has been writing in her book back to front. We asked “that’s kind of weird why do you write from the back of your book to the front” and she looked at us and said she didn’t even notice she was doing that. She had then mentioned to us later on in the evening that she feels like she’s slipping with memory and feels confused a lot. So then today she asks me to make her a pot of coffee. I made it for her and she poured herself a big glass of orange juice. She put her orange juice on hold with barely a sip out of it and made a coffee. Then I hear a can crack open and she’s got a beer on the go. I said that’s an odd combo drinking a coffee with a beer and she said she forgot she made herself a coffee. I stood back looking at a full glass of orange juice a full coffee and a fresh cracked beer in front of her. We are going to have a talk with my wife’s siblings about this but it feels like this has come on suddenly and she’s only 68. Any help of what to do?

My wife and I had seen Rosati’s whenever we went to Foxtail to pick up coffee, and I finally wanted to pull the trigger and get some pizza from there. That was a big, big mistake. Here is the review that I left on Google: 

“My wife and I ordered our pizza around 5:10-ish in the evening, and set for our pizza to be picked up at 6pm. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:57, and when I spoke to the person at the counter they told me that it would be about 15 minutes. Alright, no problem. I sat down, and a guy who was already sitting there asked me what time my order was for. I told him 6pm, and he told me that his was for 5pm and he had been there an hour. This should've set off alarm bells to the point where I should've abandoned ship, but for some reason I chose to wait. Eventually the guy who had been waiting got his pizza around 6:05, I put in my AirPods because I was the only one in the restaurant, and I waited.

Here's what happened while I was waiting.

There were two people in the back working, one who would come to the front occasionally. There were times where the phone rang and rang but nobody came up to answer it. A lady walked in and asked for her order, and they told her 15 minutes, so she went back to her car. Then a couple of other people came in looking for orders…and again…was told 15 minutes. At about the 30-45 minute mark of sitting there, a couple walked in and ordered pizza and asked if they could eat at the tables when their food came out. At this point I wanted to give them some kind of signal that they didn't want to do that and that they should go somewhere else. I left it alone, though, so together we waited. A Door Dash person came in looking for a pizza, and yes, you guessed it, they were told 15 minutes.

Eventually a guy walked in with a bag from Lidl and went immediately to the back. I thought to myself, did they run out of ingredients? And I realized that they had told some people they had to substitute some types of meat for other meats. This is when ignorantly I was like alright, maybe this was the holdup. The guy brought some toppings. Fine. I waited a bit longer….but 7pm arrived and I realized I needed to say something. I asked the guy the status of my order, and when he went to the back I heard the original person I spoke with say ""10 MINUTES IT'S GOING IN THE OVEN NOW."" Alright….at this point I feel like my intelligence is being insulted, but fine. 10 minutes goes by…no pizza. At this point my wife had enough, she comes in and asks for a refund so that we can leave because we are starving. The guy goes back to ask someone to do the refund, and I hear one of them say they do not know how to do refunds, but a lady comes out and gives us a refund, though wasn't nearly as apologetic as she should've been. We left, got food somewhere else, and that was that.

I don't write food reviews because usually if bad things happen, they're pretty isolated. Based off everything I have seen on these reviews, way too many people have had my experience, so I felt that it was important to speak my peace as well. I don't know what is going on at Rosati's, but we won't be going back. If it's lack of staff, hire more people. If you can't keep up supply, maybe don't take more orders than you can do or like…close early. Don't tell every single person that comes in it will be 15 minutes. People have lives. Our dog was at home thinking that we were never coming home (literally, she was more excited than normal when we finally walked in).

Oh, and one more thing: while we were getting the refund, somehow the couple that walked in way after I had already ordered got their pizza. The insult to injury was real.”

Let this be a warning: If you want Chicago style pizza, just go to Acme in Holly Springs or the Rosati’s in Morrisville (I’ve been to that one and didn’t have a problem). I don’t know what the hell is going on at the one in Apex, but I’m still pissed about it and hope they close before more people have to suffer the fate that I did.

Early on, pay attention to red flags like an obsession with social media appearances, name-dropping, or dodging vulnerable conversations, as these suggest a focus on facade over substance. To counter this, steer interactions toward deeper topics, asking about their values, fears, or dreams to gauge their willingness to be genuine. If they deflect or keep things surface-level, they may not be ready for real intimacy. Set firm boundaries to avoid being pulled into their performative world, whether it’s declining extravagant outings that feel inauthentic or suggesting low-key dates like coffee or a walk to test their comfort with simplicity. Gently encourage authenticity by sharing your own real moments, creating a safe space for them to drop their guard, but don’t force it if they resist. Protect your energy, as dating someone obsessed with an artificial lifestyle can drain you if they treat you more like a prop than a partner. Trust your instincts—if their curated vibe breeds doubt rather than trust, it’s okay to walk away. Ultimately, prioritize finding someone who values you for you, not as an accessory to their polished narrative, and seek a connection built on mutual authenticity.",17,1759632313.0,dating_advice,3,0.95,False

SGP Pros:

* Super clean on the countertop. Static? Don't care, the design of the SGP keeps stray coffee grounds in the chamber until I clean it, it's actually really good design for the home. Don't have to think about it.
* Serviceable espresso that noone complains about
* Reliable, 10 years on with regular use

SGP Cons:

* IF you decide to clean it frequently, it's a chore.
* Dulls flavors, makes it pointless to bring home nicer coffees

DF54 Pros:

* Espresso cup quality is awesome, has doubled my spend on fancy beans, I'm matching cortado quality of my favorite cafés at home (like Four Barrel in SF). I can actually drink straight shots from the DF54 without milk and enjoy them. The mids and high notes are there. I now have fruitiness and pleasant acidity in my espresso at home. The shots are luscious and creamy. The SGP was not in the same ballpark, it just made chocolatey somewhat bitter espresso ready for lots of milk, cortados and plain shots were out of the question.
* The motor has a quiet, smooth hum. When you throw the beans in, you don't hear the revs drop, it sounds like the beans are getting cut up by a thousand tiny swords, and that the motor has more than enough power. It's nice. .

DF54 Cons:

* Incredibly messy. Necessitated purchase of small vacuum cleaner. Grind, and the front of the machine is covered in staticky grounds. Pump the bellows, and it barfs coffee all over the counter even with the catch cup in place.
* Retention is much lower. BUT, every time I walk into the kitchen, I honk the bellows, and voila somehow there is more coffee that's ready to come out. I can see why people experience clogs. To prevent them, you have to honk the bellow every time you wander into the kitchen, and you'll see little clumps and particles coming out even if they weren't ready to come out 30 minutes earlier. Run the motor for a second, pump again, and hey guess what there's more coffee stuck in there that's now ready to come out. It's a pain in the ass to use the DF54 because of the mess. It's for nerds, you have to really want the third-wave experience at home.

Additional thoughts:

I'd like to see companies challenge themselves to create some sort of air-purging and self-cleaning routine for these low-retention single dose grinders, especially at higher prices. That will give me a reason to spend USD 1000-2000 and not be cynical about diminishing returns. Give me back the ability I had with my SGP to simply grind and walk away without cleaning up every time.",2,1759632190.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Hello, and welcome to episode 3 of Confessions of a Human Mind. 

Hi guys, so you're guna come around the house with me today because (shitty skeevo fanfare) and I'm sorry this is uh, coming a day late but, in a big BIG breaking news story yesterday, the kids are coming to my house for the first time in 5 months. 

It's so...I'm so happy and overjoyed but at the same time, I'm like wait what...wh...wh...what do I need to move out of the way, what do I need cuz I...in 5 months, my house has changed, I had a studio downstairs for a while, that's packed away, everything's safe. I'm just going around and making sure everything is hunky dory, I think it is. 

I'm making sure I've got Poppy and Alfie's favorite things. I got Poppy uh a present that she asked me for specifically, I hope it's the right size. And I've got Alfie something that he didn't ask for cuz he doesn't ask for things, cuz he's nonverbal, but. I think he's guna like it. 

Um. I have a...a friend of mine monitoring it um, because I have to have monitorized...monit...monitorized...monit...monitorized...not monetized...monitor...monitorized visits because um...I sub...a whole...well I mean uh. I had a relapse, obviously. And it was in the middle of a...uh temporary...

OH I can't talk about...I can't...actually I'm legally...can't talk about this stuff right now, but just know that...yeah...basically, no...none of it would have happened unless I had relapsed, so I have to take responsibility for it, although...there's some stuff I'm...right now I'm having to prove I didn't do, just for the sake of clearing my name. And, for the sake of the kids when they get older, I don't want them thinking I did certain things, so I have a computer forensic scientist, y'know, disproving some things, which is taking a long time. But he's doing really good work, and um. Y'know. We'll see...it just takes a long time to go th...to prove you didn't do something digitally. Is, you have to go through all your computers and look at IP addresses, all your emails, stuff like that, so just...I guess it takes time. 

And, I was pl...I was like...I can't talk about the case, but...just to let you know, I was...I, I...a couple of weeks ago, I, I was like...let's just...just let's drop it, like I don't...I want the path of least resistance, I don't want to be adversarial, I'm done with...I'm exhausted with all the f...fighting and um...lawyers and back forth like...I just...j-just...like...move on. And. It was my attorney that actually said to me, you can't move on from certain accusations that aren't you because it...for the future, for if your kids ever look back and see y'know and...I was like yeah, you're right. So I have to cop to what I did and. I've been. I think I've been pretty exhaustive with that. And I've been very honest. 

Even my attorney's like, you're very very honest and that's a blessing and a course. But you are very honest, um. So yeah, I'll admit to all the stuff I did. Um. But. 

(BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP)

My coffee's ready. But um. Yeah. I'm. I just can't admit to stuff I didn't do, so. That's the thing that's dragging on, it's just so expensive, oh my god. But um. Y'know on the plus side, while this, all this is going on, I am. The. The relationship with my kids is...it's always been amazing, it was amazing from the minute I saw them again. Um. And. It's funny because the...can I talk about this even? I think I can talk about the visits. Um. They note everything down that happens, and I got to read all the reports of my visits and it was like...unexpectedly a very pleasant thing to...to read about. And I was like oh my god, yeah they...y'know, people are saying th-that...the bond is so strong between the f...the father and the kids. And I've...it was just beautiful to read, and um. 

It reminded me of our first meeting after all that time and I had a cat for Poppy and I called her...like a stuffed cat, not a real cat, and I gave it a name and we just instantly fell back into...as though 5 months had never happened. And uh. I had a list of responses to...to what am I guna say if she says ""where were you for 5 months"" and I had a list of things that I'd wrote...worried myself to death over, sleepless nights over ""What am I guna say?"" And I had this list. And she never said anything. So I was like ""Wow, I've escaped that."" And then, about 4 weeks into visits, she just um...so and that's been progressive as well, initially it was with uh...y'know with official like people for like a couple of weeks, and then it moved to their nanny, who I gave the job to in 2017, so I go...I love Carla, we go back years. And her mom is the person I've known for the longest since I moved to LA. I met her mom in 2011, she's my housekeeper, and she's been my housekeeper right the way through for...what's that...14 years. So she's...she knew all my old girlfriends, everything. So me and her mom...her mom can't speak English, but we have this communication just with...I can't even explain how we communicate, um no English, but I feel like she's seen the whole...fucking crazy journey I've had. And she's like, my Mexican mom really. Oh, sorry, Guatemalan mom. Um. So. She's like my Guatemalan mom, really. So. It's uh. 

Yeah it's quite the journey, so. So, gradually the visits have become more family, y'know l...like the old days. And then today my friend is monitoring, so they've really...like. Once they met me, they're like...ok, this is, I guess...they're like, this doesn't need to be in this...and they've actually said that they...they think it's a waste of their time to be looking after this case because like clearly I'm not...crazy dangerous cult leader. I'm just not. Um. So. That's the reason that they're...that this has happened, and other things...but mainly just things that aren't...that have been spun that aren't really true. N...not by...not by my ex, but by just people in general. 

Um. So. 

So today's a big day, cuz they're coming. And today I'm just recording this on my phone rather than recording it with the microphone cuz I thought it'd be fun to have an episode where we just...you can come around with me making the house right for...I've made a whole room for the kids. The whole...the whole downstairs spare bedroom is like...floods of toys and I made this into a room for them when they come back and I've got a room I'm guna make upstairs which is guna be Poppy's room so this'll be Alfie's down here and Poppy's will be upstairs. So that's all looking good. 

So my friend is monitoring. She's got her kids with her, she's got a 7 year old and a 15 year old and the 7 year old wants to come play with Alfie and Poppy,  um. So. We're trying to sort that out as we...right now, um. Yeah so it's extenuating circumstances today, but this won't be late. This...this won't be late ever again, like I'm guna plan better so that it always drops on a...on a Friday. Although I do...I am thinking about...f-for some reason, my two favorite days to drop content is Tuesday and Thursday, I don't know why. It just is. So, maybe I'll do an extra one. Maybe I'll try and drop one earlier next week so that we can fall into the Tuesday/Thursday for these kind of things. And um. I wana read all your comments about if you want me to drop every...something every day cuz I do...I'm interested in that. Cuz I think it's...when I was doing that, it was kind of...it...myself, looking back, you can kind of see a journey of a life more. So. I think I'm guna start dropping every day. Something, y'know. A bit of music, a photograph, a uh...a...a call, a, a whatever. But then the podcast will always be...my dream would be a Tuesday or a Thursday, I'm still figuring that out. But we'll never miss a week, I'm guna keep going with this. 

I like it, y'know. I mean...I wana talk today a little but about...just the feeling of...I feel like a criminal. I feel like I'm under the...the eye of y'know...authorities, drug testers, rehab. And I'm not used to it y'know. Like to begin with, I I I, I guess I was like...oh this is a novelty, like. I have this weird thing where I don't get rattled by big...big dramatic problems. I don't get rattled by them which is why I'm good at running business, like I was good at running the production company we had before and I was producing artists for...god since I was 20. And that can involve a lot of stressful, a lot of big things like people quitting and artists being like ""I'm not doing this record."" and record companies going ""we're pulling the plug."" Like big massive things like that. I've been working in film since my early 20s in movies and like...with film studios, with movie studios they make everything a HUGE HUGE crisis, because there's so many millions of dollars on these films. Every day is a HUGE crisis, so I got it beaten into me when I was very young like...on films like Moulin Rouge, and every day's a big big existential crisis, you're guna get fired, you're never guna work again. And it was so much, that now. Now I'm 51, if something massive happens, I can take it in my stride. If um...someone doesn't pay for...someone turns around and goes, when I was working with the production company I had with Laura, if someone rips us off, some bank puts a video out that totally steals one of our ideas, I just know how to handle it and I do and I fix the problem and I take care of business, and I'm very matter of fact and I'm very effective. 

But. If I lose a button on my shirt, I freak the fuck out. So the small things are what I've gotta watch for, y'know. So for example like, being arrested for me and going to jail was like a big novelty and I was like ""Oh this is interesting, I wonder if I can talk about binaural beats and stuff to the guys in the..."" like the whole thing, was um. I didn't freak. Like I...I was...I had like a...I was charged in like a ""OH NEW EXPERIENCE"" kind of way. Um. And it sounds weird to say like normally...normal people would be freaking out and I was like having nice conversations with the police, and they were like well you're cl...they were like...anyway I can't even talk about that, they they threw the case out the next day and it was fine and I didn't have a problem with that but (burp) when I came home that same week, someone stole my rubbish bin from outside my house and that like...I had a meltdown over that. So I've...I'm sort of topsy turvy. I'm not very good at life stuff but I can deal with like big business craziness. I can deal with big production, lots of money involved, uh...like big decisions. I can make snap decisions with like big budgets, stuff like that. But, if a pasta doesn't get cooked right for my son, I...y'know?

So initially, I say all that to say that initially, this thing about being drug tested and being under (clears throat) under the eye of the courts and not being able to talk a big part of my life, not being able to talk about big things going on, not being able to talk about crazy accusations, not being able to talk about like...things that I've copped to. It felt like ""Oh this is interesting this is a new way of living I wonder how I'm guna cope with this y'know I wonder how...how my brain is guna cope with this."" And I was kind of watching my brain in an interesting way, and it was kind of in a weird way exciting like a different thing I never had happen to me before. And um. But now as the weeks have worn on, I'm just...because it's become normal, the emailing the place to see if I'm drug testing that day and then having drug tests for my rehab and then...I'm not kidding, like 3 or 4 or 5 drug tests a week, it's becoming tedious and the inef...the fact that they're so slow when you go in there and I'm supposed to be seeing my kids and I've got a visit but I'm in the drug testing place. And it's...it...now it's just getting me down, to be honest, it's getting me down. And um. I just feel like I'm being judged by people that don't know me. Um.

Yeah it's kind of...it's kind of...it's turned the corner from being a novelty and and,...y'know maybe this will be an int...this is a good story fo...sort of a good life story for c'mon guys leave me alone. (Laughs). It's clear I didn't do the stuff I'm being accused of, just... Y'know. Um. And I hate second guessing, you know that I love to be very open about my life, that's what I do is just talk about my life and what goes on in it and I HATE having to go, am I allowed to say that, I hate it. I HATE IT. Um. So. Y'know I'm...God willing this will only be going on for another few weeks. And I'm so excited about my kids coming here, so y'know. I'm getting down about being chained like a criminal, and not being able to y'know be free with my words and free with my content, but on the other side of it, the fact that I am agreeing to this restriction and y'know...toeing the line means that my kids are here today, so I gotta...I've gotta balance it out and and realize that. Um.

Yeah, it's a...it's a very interesting time. It was interesting, now it's tedious. And annoying. Just the official stuff. (Dishes clank. Skeevy snickers.) 

You're with me uh...in the kitchen, tidying up, hope you don't mind. I think this is interesting, like having a conversation like this like me on a facetime to you like not with the visuals. Maybe I'll do a visual one. A visual one would be good wouldn't it? Like a video fa...I might do like a facetime, that would be cool. I should have done that on this one. Um. Maybe next time I'll do that. Um. So. Oh I like that idea I'm guna write that on my wall. No I'm not writing on the wall anymore. I started writing on the wall when I was high. And when I got sober, I was like ""Most of the things I did when I was high were crazy. But a couple of them...a couple of them were great."" Like the wall is a great place to write because it's the only place I write that I don't forget something. But at the same time. If someone comes to my house and sees writing on the wall I look like a crazy person, so I've gotta stop doing that. And. (Laughs.) So there's that. So where am I guna write that now?

Where am I guna write Facetime...uh... ""Patreon Call = Facetime Call ?"" where am I guna write that? So that I don't forget it, I would have written it on the wall and I wouldn't have forgotten it, um. But now no. 

Do you have this thing, does anyone else have this thing with calendars like with digital calendars or...I don't take them seriously. Ever. If I write something in my cal...my ical on my phone, I won't do it, I won't even look at it again. I won't do it and I won't even look at it again. Am I alone in this? Cuz I...I don't...I just...I won't look at it. I don't take it seriously. If it was on my wall I would do it. (Laughs). But then when I was high and writing on my wall, I'd be too high to look at it, so that didn't work either. Aye. 

And I'm also realizing that I'm...I'm moving away from...like...I like shooting things on my phone, I like talking on my phone, I like using my phone to make content, and the more high production big lot of setup involved like. For this for example, I could have gone into my studio and sat down and done it all posh but, I wana get out the emotion of how I'm feeling. And if I take 5-10 minutes to set up the podcast studio, then I've lost the emotion of what I wanted to say. I've lost the fire of what I really wanted to talk to you about which is this. So I like...I like being able to just instantly talk to you like a... phone call. Like a. This. I treat this...I mean this is like a phone call, isn't it. It's literally into my phone. 

So my monitor is asking me for the address. I'll just give her that. And then my ex is guna drop them off, so. But I can't see my ex. So I'm guna have to...hide, in a cupboard. (Laughs.) It's so crazy you guys, it's so crazy. Um.

Oh no, my ex has messaged me on this Talking Parents. Have you ever used Talking Parents? It's an app where you can talk to your ex...um...but it can be all pulled up in court. So it's like...a legal text messaging. So. You have to. It...I mean it's like a text message but it can all be pulled up in court, the idea is that you know. You keep it civil and y'know about the subject and that's...it's just good in that way, it's very slow and it doesn't really work very well, like you have to constantly refresh it to see new messages which isn't great. Like if you've got your kids y'know, with you and something y'know there was an emergency or something, or the other one, the other way around the th...the other person had the kids and there was an emergency, Talking Parents is not a great way to communicate, so. 

I think we've been very civil on Talking P...talking y'know to the point where, I'm wondering if there's a better way to communicate on days where I have the kids. Like a more instant way, and I know text messaging is...it's dodgy, it's...I mean. It's all about establishing boundaries isn't it? It's about establishing a new way of communicating, which is really hard with someone that you were best friends with. I mean I've said this. But the thing I've found most hard to deal with with this breakup, I mean the way we are now. It's really simple, it's a really simple human emotion. I've lost my best friend. (Laughs.) I lost my best friend. That's the thing that is hardest with this for me. It's not the romantic stuff, which it. I...I mean. Honestly, I'd let go of that years ago. Um. It's...it's the best friend element. 

Like imagine your best friend, and then suddenly a court steps in and goes ""You can't talk to your best friend anymore, and if you talk to them, we're guna have a team of people talking into their ears about what you said, how it can be construed, how it could be used against you, how you can use it against them, how can...what the subtext could be. And you're like I just wana talk to my mate. I just wana talk to my friend. And I've been...I've been uh. I've been on the rec.c.c.c.c...I...I I. I've been caught out by...communicating like a friend to a friend in an official setting and realized that...now the goalposts have changed and now I can like...get in a lot of trouble for that so...um. Yeah. 

That...that's the weird thing...the weirdest thing about this to me is that. Poppy asked me to see...Poppy loves movies and before they went away, I got my...I uh...I made my bedroom...I put a projector and a movie screen in my bedroom so that they can watch movies like on a proper screen with a proper movie thing. And...for Poppy it was like...just like the best thing she'd ever seen. She was so happy and so excited, the only downside was that she never left the bedroom, she always wanted to be watching films. She loved it. And then last week she said ""Can I see a picture of the movie screen."" So I was like Ok...Y'know when I go home I'll take a picture of it. So I got back that night and took a picture of the movie screen, and the next time I saw her I showed her it. And she said uh ""Oh yeah, just wanted to make sure that Mr. Panty Poo Potts hadn't taken it away."" Mr. Panty Poo Potts is a character that I invented to stop my daughter Poppy making...(laughs)...I don't know if you saw it, I made a video about it, it went a little bit viral so you might know this story. 

So my daughter went through a phase of making what she called water pancakes. Which was basically, she would just pour water in everything in my entire house. Everything that could contain water, I would come down the next day and there would be water in it. Everything. Everything that could contain water would have water. And then was like OH DADDY IT'S A WATER PANCAKE I MADE IT FOR YOU and I'm like...Ok, well yeah but...then ""Yeah my studio equipment doesn't need water on it because...that's bad, y'know?"" So I thought, I'll invent...I don't wana...I don't wana be...I'm guna experiment with having...inventing a character who's got an aversion to water pancakes, and that can be the bad guy. This was years...or a couple of years ago...or maybe last year, before I knew that you have to...there's a certain way to enforce boundaries (laughs) and I sa...the character, admittedly not the best name for a character that's supposed to be scary, Mr. Panty Poo Potts I called him. And uh yeah...Mr. Panty Poo Potts uh...it's...the idea of him was that he was supposed to be a scary person that didn't like water pancakes and she would be like ""I'm never guna do water pancakes again because that man gets so upset about water pancakes."" In a fun way, y'know. I made him too fun, didn't I? I made him too fun, and too funny, and Poppy loves Mr...from day one, she's wanted to make more water pancakes to see him more. 

So it backfired on me so heavily, Mr. Panty Poo Potts, oh I want to see...Oh I better make more water pancakes cuz Mr. Panty Poo Potts is guna come tell me off, and he tells me off in such a funny way that I want to see him more often. So the water pancakes thing has, uh, stopped. Months ago, it just stopped. Mr. Panty Poo Potts has carried on. And he...now he's a big part of our lives, Mr. Panty Poo Potts. He's invisible, you can't see him, he uh...lives behind my orange sofa which happens to be where the movie screen comes out of the ceiling, so. He lives very near to the movie screen. He likes to say HELLO (oh wow I can't even describe this voice but it's cringe, lmfao) - that's his thing, he likes to say hello. He...every...every sentence will have some weird hellos that don't make sense. And I think that was m...that was my big mistake. Making the hellos part of the telling off was bad because it made it funny. 

So for example, he'll go

HELLO, I DON'T LIKE WATER PANCAKES, AH, HELLO, I HATE THEM, HELLO DON'T DO IT AGAIN, PLEASE AH HELLO

like that. That would be his way of...I get it, that's...I get it. I would like to hang out with that guy. I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Mr. Panty Poo Potts is fun. I get it. Yeah. But that wasn't...he wasn't intended to be fun. Is what I'm saying. He was intended to be scary. (SIGH)

So she wanted to make sure that Mr. Panty Poo Potts hadn't taken the movie screen. I don't know where she got that into her head but that was concerning her for a while. So. She's happy about that. And she likes to call Mr. Panty Poo Potts now on the phone. So. When I see her she's like, Hi Daddy, I love you, where's Mr. Panty Poo Potts, can I speak to him on the phone. So we'll be in a play gym and I'll have to do his voice at that volume, that's loud. I have to do that in a play gym full of kids, that loud. Ideal? No. No, not ideal. Ideal when you're trying to prove you're not crazy? No, not ideal. Not ideal. Ideal when you have a monitored visit? No. Definitely not. Definitely not the least crazy thing to be doing when you have a monitored visit. Talking as Mr. Panty Poo Potts saying ""I've got a motorbike with three wheels and I'm coming to pick you up to talk about movies."" That's not ideal. If you want to prove that you're sane. That's not great. 

Prove that you don't have a cult, I should say. Y'know, you guys are the cult. You know you guys have been brought up in court multiple times, you guys. You you...literally y...

(phone cuts out, music plays)

Welp, there I go singing the praises of using a phone and what happens? The battery runs out and I lose the audio recording, Well thankfully, I got 26 minutes of the audio recording. I think I did a bit more but I've got 26 minutes in there. Yeesh. Hear those birds? How crazy is that. I think they're having a bird fight. 

But yeah what I was saying was you guys have been...you guys are famous. You patreon. The needed. Have been mentioned in the corridors of power. How's it feel to be known to the authorities as a cult? Let me know in the comments how you feel about being involved...in a...known to the authorities as a cult. 

So uh. Alfie's nanny took a picture of him playing the piano, video of him playing the piano. And it's so breathtaking what he's doing. It's so amazing. He's like...playing it like me...composing it like me...but better. And I can't...right now I can't show it to you. Um. But what I am guna do is I'm guna take what he's done and make a piece out of it. Taking exactly what he's done and...that'll be the first piece he's ever written, I'm just guna play it...so you can hear what he wrote. Like he basically wrote something that I wish I'd written. Literally. I wish I'd written this it's so good. Um. He. I don't...understand. I don't understand. It's crazy. He's not even 7. If I could just get him to concentrate on music. I mean that's me trying to put self will on him and he should do what he wants but...he's got the ear and he's got the writing capability. And he's really into, apparently, he goes on spotify now and picks out movie soundtracks, I mean. If that isn't evidence of genetics, I don't know what is. I mean. A kid of 6 picking out movie soundtracks on spotify specifically. I mean. Is that not crazy?

Oh, thank god. Thank god they're back in my life. Thank god. So I'm guna do music time with them today, we used to do that. I used to have them two days over the weekend, I'd have them Saturday and Sunday. So Saturday would be play day, Sunday would be music time. 

God those birds are so loud. Sorry if that's distracting birds...birds and a plane. There ya go. You've got the whole menagerie today. 

But I like this being like phone calls and facetimes. I like that. Because it's real and it's like I'm talking to you like I would talk to my friends because I see you as my friends, so to me this makes sense. But. Let me know if it's too unprofessional for you, cuz I like this. 

And a car. Airplane, birds, and a car. 

So today was a little bit different, just experimenting rather than recording it on the posh mic, I thought I would take you around on my house expedition. I think we're ready for them now. I think I'm ready for his majesty and her ladyship. I've got a witch hat, I've got a present. Yeah. Wish me luck guys, .

I love you. And um. Starting on Monday, I'll have a look at all the responses. It's been a crazy week actually sorting out my kids coming to stay with me, I'm sure you can understand. So I'm guna look at the responses to my last phone call and to this and see if you want me to post every day. Um. Y'know could be a piece of music could be a little voice memo could be a picture. But it'll be something. And I wana have these long form things like this these long...talking about my life podcasts, talking about y'know what it's like...what I feel it's like to be human which is why I called it confessions of a human mind. Um. I do these once a week, either Tuesday or Thursday, maybe Tuesday and Thursday, who knows. We'll see. But definitely once a week. 

And um. Yeah I'm rea...y'know. 64 days sober today, so...and and...I'm just learn...I'm relearning how to do life. I'm relearning how to live. I blew everything up so I'm starting again from the ground up, y'know. Literally so...teething trouble a little bit like...I didn't expect yesterday to be all this thing about having my kids here and it was an unexpected and brilliant development and. It threw off my recording, so I have to know in future to record these not the day of. Cuz I like the immediacy of recording and posting it, but I've gotta be a little bit more structured. So. I've learned...lesson learned, I'll record these like two days before they go up just in case something comes up like it did today. Yesterday sorry. 

I love you! And...I'll see you later.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: I am SO SORRY again for the consistent delays. Obviously given this man has no set schedule, I've got no way of knowing when these are coming and am typically busy when they drop. Tonight, the small demon I call my 5 year old son made dinner, bath, and bed time a living hell on earth. XD But, here it is, in all its stupid rambling bullshit glory.

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for euthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs?” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

His skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave, 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

**It** must have been about someone he liked. 

After all**,** she’d seen him smile like that many times before. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 18 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same uni- versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University. 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened. 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them, Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weight of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe; every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical suffering was **a** far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvia had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvia, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for him. Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful of seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe. It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left.

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for euthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs?” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

His skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave, 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

**It** must have been about someone he liked. 

After all**,** she’d seen him smile like that many times before. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 18 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

other. 

Their love story unfolded just like a romance novel–a bond nurtured over years of growing up side by side. 

288 ¡Vouchers 

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same uni- versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University. 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened. 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them, Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weight of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe; every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical suffering was **a** far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvia had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvia, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for him. Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful of seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe. It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me.

1nychb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1nychb1/turtle_bay_ritz_carlton_bungalow_trip_review/,"Turtle Bay (Ritz Carlton) Bungalow Trip Review (North Shore, Oahu)","After going to Waikiki about a dozen times over the years and always driving up to the North Shore for the day, I finally decided to take the plunge and stay there for real. The Ritz Carlton at Turtle Bay has always been one of those bucket list hotels for me after watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and this trip finally made it a reality.

I’ll go into a little detail about my trip, but I’m writing this review to provide more info on the bungalow room blocks to help you (and maybe future me) decide which room you want to request. Room block info is towards the bottom of this review.

# Flights and Booking

I booked first class tickets through Alaska Airlines, operated by Hawaiian, for 9/17-9/22. To be honest, I had no plans to go to Hawaii, but at $550 p/p, I jumped on the flights and decided on where to stay later. The A330 we flew out on had the older seats (2-2-2), but the 787 Dreamliner on the way back had the newer suites (1-2-1). I preferred the 787 since each “suite” had privacy panels.

I scoured to find a hotel for weeks and was going to book another plain jane hotel in Waikiki, but I figured the amount I saved (spent?) on the flights, I want to go all out on this trip. I booked the an Ocean King Bungalow at Turtle Bay through Costco Travel and it came with a few nice perks: $200 resort credit, free self parking, resort fee waived, and a $400 Costco e-gift card. Including a convertible and the optional $35/day CDW insurance, out of pocket was \~$6,500 for a 5 day car rental and 4 night stay in the bungalows.

# Check In Day

We landed the night before and decided to stay at a Hampton Inn in Kapolei because I didn’t want to spend another $1,000 and check in at 11 PM – seemed wasteful, and the hotels by the airport looked rundown. The next morning, we made our way to Helena’s, then arrived at TB around 1 PM. Initially we drove up to the main lobby, but valet told us we could check in directly with the bungalow host office. Although check in started at 3 PM, they had a room ready.

Now, I researched a fair bit to make sure we had a dreamy view, and a super helpful post by u/kozamel mentioned to ask for bungalow #114. After mentioning it about 4 times, the host made a few excuses and said #126 was what was available. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and my doubt quickly came to surface when I saw that I was >50 ft from the ocean and right near the pool. We walked back and I very kindly asked if there was anything they could do, and the manager happened to overhear and got us the room we wanted: the magical bungalow #114. More on the room blocks below.

# Food

Food options/restaurants were pretty limited. We used a majority of the $200 resort credit at Alaia, and even though it was “free”, I felt ripped off. But what can you expect at a Ritz Carlton property. The remainder (+ more out of pocket) was spent at the coffee bar in the lobby and for drinks/snacks at the poolside bungalow bar (food supplied by Sunset, the restaurant by the main pool).

It's not so much the cost, but the variety that disappointed me with the food here. Menus had limited options. A few new specialty restaurants would be a great hit (hibachi, sushi, or even capitalizing on the North Shore vibe, how about a handful of upscale food truck-style kiosks for quick eats?) I’m obviously not the Ritz Carlton clientele, but this is all my own opinion anyway, so take it for what you will. We ended up eating around Haleiwa and Kahuku to eat arguably better food with a more authentic feel (plus the added benefit of supporting locals).

# Our Bungalow (#114) & General Experience

Stunning, jaw-dropping perfection. Beautiful floating King bed directly facing the ocean. Newly installed bidets. The view did not disappoint, but I did notice #117 had an even better view, though I'm not sure if it was a 2 queen bed room, or a King room. I’m not here to write a super detailed room review, but a few quirks: the power outages were a bit annoying and they seemed to happen each night. I couldn’t tell if it was from an outage or not, but the lights in the main room and bathroom kept flickering throughout our stay. We couldn’t dial in the A/C each night, so we were either freezing or sweating. The ceiling fan would turn on full blast and must’ve messed with the thermostat as well. It was the 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) night when we decided to call for a technician, but there was a property-wide power outage so no one was available. Overall, not the best, but we made do and this did not tarnish my time in the bungalows.

We used the complementary bicycles a couple times and rode down to the Banyan tree (featured in Lost), the pillbox, stables, and also Kaihalulu Beach (where there’s a Keiki \[or child\] pool with shallow water).

For parking, we always found at least 1 spot in the east lot (this is where the host office is as well). There was an overflow lot to the west, closer to the 140 block of rooms, and complementary valet was optional in case you couldn’t find a spot.

Jon at the bungalow pool bar was great made the whole experience so special. Super, super friendly and we had a blast chatting with him on the days he was there. Unfortunately, no jacuzzi at the bungalow pool.

One thing I didn’t know is that the bungalows have access to a small beach (few entrances, main one near room 126). They had a few umbrellas and chairs, but it was pretty rocky.

# Bungalow Blocks

Now, let’s get into the bungalow blocks. After all, this is why I wanted to write this review. Block 137-142 will be added as a comment because I'm limited to 20 photos.

To start, here’s a satellite view with some notations:

**Rooms 112 to 118**

This is the magic block. You'll see a photo from my room (#114), but it seemed #117 had a better view.

**Rooms 119 to 124**

None of these rooms are good, unless you prefer looking out to a pool.

**Rooms 125 to 130**

We were originally given #126, and I'm glad I switched to #114.

Room #125 is closest to the pool (can get noisy). If I had to pick a room in this block, it would probably be #129.

**Rooms 131 to 136**

\#131 is probably the best room in this block. None of these are ideal, but the large palm tree isn't totally obstructing the view from #131.

[#131-136. #131 is on the left in this photo](https://preview.redd.it/tswfpxhac7tf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=968605073705b7ff80bc0982738810e9a6ea2229)

**Rooms 137 to 142**

**Check comments. Reached photo limit in this post. I added 4 more comments to show both sides of 137-142 and what the general view looks like.**

# Overall Thoughts

It’s a surreal experience having that kind of view each day, but cost aside, I’m not sure I would stay there the next time I visit Oahu. I’m usually more into peace and quiet rather than the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but sometimes it’s nice stepping out and having a ton of options at your feet. I only wish I got to experience this property before Marriott took over, because the tidbits I heard about how it was run before seemed like it would’ve been a better time. I think I finally have to venture out of Oahu and visit the other islands, and I can’t wait for that.

Many of the replies told me to kill him, so I’ve been biding my time and planning.

I read about a toxin called ricin which is super deadly. I don’t know how it works, but my plan was simple: Get some of those hard, little white pellets and slip them into his drink. Fortunately, they sell them in huge bags.

Six months ago, I boldly slipped ricin into his coffee. It turns out the ricin is also biding its time, as he’s still coming into work every morning. I’ve upped the dosage, which tipped him off. He hollered “*Who the #%¥$ keeps putting rice in my coffee?*” and now I’m too nervous to go any further.

I don’t know what to do but to occasionally stare daggers into the man while he’s not looking. I worry that they’ll find out it was me and fire me before the ricin kills him.

Should I put some ricin in his lunch instead?",7,1759631047.0,Noearthsociety,0,1.0,False

1nyceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Unable_East7227/comments/1nyceme/fake_friends/,fake friends,"I dont know if anyone will read this. Ive talked about this to my therapist but i wanted to write it somewhere to get more advice. I am 21 years old and the past three years weren't that great as many things have happened. For example, i got into a university i didn't like, many heartbreaks, bullying about my choices or myself and my appearence and more i don't want to talk about now. In these years I went into many phases. It was difficult for me to have a stable mood, a stable style and my mood always depended on how people treated me. All those since 2022 to 2025. Let's talk about now. I am with a very loving and caring man, we used to be friends but we became a couple since we fell in love with each other. He is the most perfect man and i cant express my feelings for him right now because i will never stop writing. When i met him, a year ago we were hanging as friends a lot, he never canceled our plans and that made me really happy because two of my friends (good friends) were always cancelling our plans a lot or did not respected me and my time because in that time i was working and was also in university, so i didnt have much time and was tired. The one of them 2 knew i was at work and cancelled saying she was tired (she isnt working or doing anything special). After some hours she posted a story at 3 or 4 am in the morning with some friends and a car. She then told me that they forced her to go and i was like, mhm okay its fine. Inside my brain the thoughts were telling me: ""well she is 21 years old she can say no to them tf"" and i started being distant especially when my boyfriend and i got together because we were always with each other. We lost contact and she only texted me about university which i found dumb because she knows that i was skipping classes a lot. But maybe she wanted to come close to me again but everytime i was answering her she then left me on delivered and never answered my texts. Lets move to my other ""friend"" which was also my best friend. We were having so much fun and sleep overs. She had canceled our plans many times and one time i was ready to leave for her house because we had agreed a week ago to stay at her house that night. She canceled and said that her mum told her to not go to her house because the cleaning lady would go the next morning.. yeah whatever. And the same night she went to her boyfriend's house. She clearly chose her boyfriend over me but i dont blame her because i would alslo choose my man over her but i would make time for her because we hadn't hung out in a while. Okay so. I also stopped having time for her because she was being a bitch. After a concert we had, we agreed to go for coffee as a double date and she invited a girl that talked shit about me and my boyfriend. That was very nice of her. She had done many bad things in the past to other people and always had a very weird behaviour as sh was the most wanted girl in the world. On summer I went to something big she had that was very important to her because i didnt want to be the bad guy and not go hoping she would appreciate (i think she did as she said she was happy i made it). After two weeks i had birthday and threw a party and invited her and her bf. She didnt answer at first and after i double texted her she said that she doesnt know if she will come because she was working the next morning. I was waiting for her to come or a message but she never said anything or something like she was sorry she couldnt come and instead i got nothing bcs she never texted me again in general. She knew very well that i wasnt feeling good the last three years, she knew it and she was seeing me in a bad condition the last time we met but never cared enough. Turns out i had bpd and depression all these years and thats why i was struggling a lot everyday with emotions and depressive episodes as trying to hurt or kms. My psychiatrist gave me antideppresants and life has been a little hard lately but those two friends disappeared when i needed companion. I now have 4 good friends (now 3 because my one friend went to another country for a university program) and i end up staying at home some days when my boyfriend goes out with his friends. I was thinking what if i texted the first friend i mentioned to go out sometime. About the first friend I forgot to mention that we talked in the beggining of August and told her that i wasnt very well. She called me 3 weeks after and asked what happened but i didnt tell her because i got disappointed that she forgot about me and werent friends anymore. What should i do? Stay at home when nobody else can and feeling lonely or text her?

I left PH two years ago and finally came back for a short vacation to see my family and friends. As an excited kiddo, syempre I told them right away when I got my flight ticket.

Then this one friend starts chatting in our group insisting we should do a staycation. I said yes, thinking it would just be around Manila. I even offered 5K — I know it’s not a lot, but that’s all I could give since I need to prioritize my family first. Guess what he replied? “5K? Pang-gas lang yan eh papuntang Batangas.” Like… excuse me? I was so taken aback. To avoid awkwardness, I just reacted with a laugh emoji and said maybe we can do something in Manila instead, since I really can’t afford to leave for a couple of days.

Two of my friends agreed with me. One got a little disappointed but honestly, the hell I care? We ended up planning something simple: just dinner and coffee.

So the day came. We met at a ramen place in QC. I came early because I didn’t want them waiting, but they arrived late ‘cause of the heavy rain, which was fine. We started chatting about work and old stuff since we all used to be officemates.

And here comes this mahaderang friend. He just wouldn’t shut up about my ex-manager. Like hello!? Di ka pa rin maka-move on? Lahat kami naka-move on na sa issue. Then he had the audacity to call me “Ilong” just because I don’t eat vegetables. Like DUDE??? You’re a married man with two kids. Grow up. You stayed exactly where I left you years ago. I kept my cool, trying not to ruin dinner, but he just kept throwing insults like he thought he was being funny. He even pinched my cheeks for no reason. Who even does that?

But the last straw? He posted an IG story of me looking like crap, just to announce to the world that I was back in PH.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cleveland Browns vs. Minnesota Vikings: A London Lark with a Side of Sacks**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a transatlantic tussle that’s less “Monday Night Football” and more “Monday Morning Coffee Spill”—messy, unpredictable, and best consumed with a paper towel. The Cleveland Browns (1-3) and Minnesota Vikings (2-2) collide in Week 5 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where the real drama might be whether the Browns’ rookie QB Dillon Gabriel remembers how to throw a spiral or if the Vikings’ injured offensive line has replaced their linemen with a bunch of overcooked spaghetti. Let’s parse the chaos.

---

### Odds Breakdown: A Tale of Two Teams

The Vikings are listed as **3.5-point favorites** across most books, with implied win probabilities hovering around **62-65%** (thanks to decimal odds of \~1.52). The Browns, meanwhile, are priced at **+2.6**, translating to a **38-40% chance** to pull off an upset. The total line sits at **36.5 points**, with most books offering even money on Over/Under.

Key stats? The Vikings’ defense is a leaky dam—last week, they allowed the Steelers to gain yards like a toddler with a juice box. Their own offense? J.J. McCarthy is on the sidelines, replaced by a backup QB who’s probably more famous for his TikTok dance routines than his arm strength. The Browns? They’re starting **Dillon Gabriel**, a rookie who’s completed 3-of-4 passes for 19 yards and a touchdown in his NFL cameo. That’s the football equivalent of a toddler napping through a math test but acing the nap.

### Injury Report: A Shakespearean Tragedy

The Vikings are currently playing “Where’s J.J.?” with their starting QB and offensive linemen. Their recent loss to the Steelers was a sack fest—Carson Wentz w

First time poster on Reddit. Please bare with me 😂. Just wanted to vent a little and ask for advice if that's okay. My husband (35m) and I (32f) have been married for a little over 5 years and no kids. Last month he worked 12 hr days due to being short staffed and it's looking like that will happen this month too. After work he'll decompress with a boxing class or two after work. So typically he gets home around 7:30-8:30pm and we're in bed by 9-ish. Usually we'll have dinner together once a week on Thursdays because that's the day he takes a break from his boxing class. 

I've talked to him about feeling lonely and feeling like I barely see him because of his work schedule and workout classes on top of that, but feel guilty because I know he enjoys them and I know doing activities by himself is important to him. Plus, he doesn't go to class Thursday and that's our quality time evening since he gets home around 6pm. Last weekend we did have a nice BBQ with some of our friends over on Saturday, then Sunday he watched the football game with some of his work friends at a pizza joint/bar. I was a little bummed because he lost track of time and got home later than he said he would.  

This weekend is where I'm feeling like I'm really starting to spiral. Today (Saturday) is his only day off this week. We spent time this morning sitting outside out drinking coffee and chatting, then he got ready to meet his work friends at Oktoberfest. He reminded me that he was working tomorrow, I had totally forgotten and started to tear up realizing this morning was the only time we'd have together. He left for his friend date and  said he would check-in periodically but didn't. 
 
A few hours after dropping him off, I called and texted him with no answer and started to internally freak out (chronic over thinker here). He finally called me back an hour later but I was already frustrated and exploded on him. I asked him when he thought he'd home and he explained that he was hanging out with his friends and wouldn't give me an answer. My emotions got the best of me and I hung up on him, which I know is immature. I feel like I'll plan friend dates so we can both attend but then he'll be invited to friend dates where the wives aren't included. My brain is telling me he likes the convenience of a wife but doesn't want the responsibility of communicating when out with others. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting his ""time scraps"" and not a prority. 

ObviousIy I have so many feelings about this whole situation but I'm really trying to see it from his point of view. How do you guys juggle a spouse that works long hours and values their alone time??!",3,1759630634.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False
1nycady,https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarGeneralWorkers/comments/1nycady/asm_trouble/,ASM trouble,"I have a new ASM bc my last one was promoted to her very own store (congrats girl, you deserved it)! So my new one was transferred over from another district (they don’t want her back) and promoted from key holder. I’ve taught her enough to keep it running, I have told her before I was looking forward to spending one on one time w her. I welcomed her in w open arms, made her a thankyou card- got us coffee and donuts. Always tell my team thankyou. 

So one day my DM calls me and says ASM tells her we have a big issue. It’s about the schedule. But I have changed this schedule every week since I took her in! I told DM to look at all the edits. Yes, she had issues and asked me to change it. I did. Apparently I scheduled her the last 3 days of the week to work and the first 3 days of the week due to me fixing it, and she comes in work crying ligit REAL tears that she can’t work 6 days in a row (she’s 31 like me) so I tell her… Well ask dude in an hour when he gets here if he can switch w you bc I can’t just switch up everyone’s days off. But instead of waiting the hour, she tells my DM we have a big issue

She’s telling me she’s open availability but can’t handle the shifts she’s given. I have to pretty much open bc she’s messing up. And it’s not me bc I will explain something 5 times and she will still get it wrong. I will text her things and have to copy/paste and edit/cut just to tell her something she should just scroll back and reread her texts. Or she will text back something “like this?” And it’ll be nothing like I asked & find myself repeating it. 

I just lost an employee bc they moved away and I texted my team group chat, if anyone was willing to work an extra day next week bc I didn’t have a day off and would like atleast 1 day. This bitch texts me that she wants it. Huh??? Wasn’t you just crying? Then she turns around and tells my DM I’m over working her, she never sees her kid anymore. So clearly she is texting me one thing & my DM the opposite. Like why? Hypocrite! I feel like she’s just trying to make me look bad. 

So turn around, she’s an hour late to work and I wrote her up for it. I told her… “now the rules of DG are that you can’t get fired unless you’re written up for the same thing 3 times. You can’t get written up for all kinds of things- but 3 strikes you’re out. So don’t worry or freak out, your job isn’t at risk. Just don’t keep doing it bc I’d hate to see you go.”  I mean. Can’t be any nicer than that, right??? 

Then she’s telling my DM I’m trying to get her fired and she going off about how I’m so awkward to be around when we switch off and I’m mean. I give everyone the days off they want, I always say thanks. I’m actually a very mellow person & I’ve actually done a lot for her. I’m very disheartened to know I have someone who’s trying to hurt me instead of helping me. 

My DM agrees that she needs demoted bc she’s made it very clear to the DM she can’t handle it. I also have all the screen shots of her saying different things to both us and if you guys even want, I can screenshot some of the stupid stuff she’s texted me back & I’ll drop all the recipes lol. After I find her replacement, she’s stepping down. And I don’t really have the hours for her & no store wants her. Soooo. Very unfortunate. She cost herself her own title.

*By The AI Who Still Thinks ""Giants"" Is a Metaphor for ""Bad at Math""*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Eagles Are Here to Play, the Giants Are Here to Cry**  
The Philadelphia Eagles (4-0) are the NFL’s version of a math test: *everyone knows they’re coming, but no one’s prepared for how crushing they’ll be*. Their moneyline odds range from **-800 to -850** (implied probability: **89-90%**) across bookmakers, while the New York Giants (1-3) sit at **+650 to +700** (11-13%). That’s not a typo—it’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Don’t waste your money on the Giants unless you want to cry in your coffee.”

The spread tells a similar story: Eagles are -7.5 to -8.0, with the Giants +7.5 to +8.0. The total line is **42.5 to 43.0**, with the Under priced slightly better (1.91-1.95) than the Over. For context, the Eagles have held three of their four opponents under 20 points this season. The Giants? They’ve allowed 28+ points in three straight games. Their defense plays like a sieve that’s been *personally insulted* by the opposing offenses.

**Key Stat**: The Eagles’ defense ranks **1st in the league in points allowed (12.3 PPG)**, while the Giants’ offense is **29th in points scored (14.5 PPG)**. It’s like watching a Michelin-starred chef cook for a group of people who think “seasoning” is a type of glitter.

---

**2. Digest the News: Eagles Are Healthy, Giants Are a Medical Mystery**  
Philadelphia’s roster is as clean as a hospital hallway on a Sunday. Jalen Hurts is back to his MVP form, and the offensive line is protecting him like a swarm of bees guards honey. The defense? They’re the NFL’s version of a “Do Not Disturb” sign—*no one’s getting through*.

The Giants, meanwhile, are a hot mess. Their starting quarterback, **Daniel Jones**, is listed as **questionable** with a “mysterious rib injury” (read: he tripped over his own ego last week). Backup **Cooper Rush** (yes, the same guy who’s been juggling duties in Baltimore) is expected to start, which is either a bold move or a cry for help. Their offensive line? It’s held together with duct tape and hope.
