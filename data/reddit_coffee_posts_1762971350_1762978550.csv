I Googled “homemade drain cleaner” and found a combo of baking soda and vinegar. Seems harmless, right?

I poured the mix down the drain, followed by hot water. Nothing happened. So I grabbed a plunger. The first push? Fine. The second? Fine. The third? A geyser of black sludge exploded out of the drain like a horror movie.

I screamed, slipped on the sludge, and took down my shower curtain in the process. It looked like the sink had thrown up Satan’s coffee. I had to shower for an hour just to stop smelling like burnt pennies.

Ended up paying the plumber anyway and he laughed when I told him.

1ovec6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/1ovec6j/i_made_a_free_tool_that_autocuts_videos_from_time/,I made a free tool that auto-cuts videos from time ranges,"Hey Resolve users!



Let me tell you about my very specific problem: I work at a hospital editing surgical footage. These videos can be 2-3 hours long, and since I'm not a doctor, I have no idea what's medically relevant.



So doctors send me timestamp lists like this:



\`\`\`

1m57-2m08

5m22-5m45

12m30-13m15

\`\`\`



And I used to spend \*forever\* scrubbing through the timeline, finding each timestamp, cutting, dragging clips around... you get it. Mind-numbing work.



I figured ""there's gotta be a tool for this, right?"" Wrong. Couldn't find anything that just lets you paste timestamps and auto-cut.



So I said screw it and built \*\*Clip Assassin\*\* for DaVinci Resolve.



How it works:



1. Open Resolve with your project

2. Run Clip Assassin (it's a standalone .exe for Windows, or Python script for macOS/Linux)

3. Paste your time ranges (supports \`1m57-2m08\`, \`1:57-2:08\`, \`0:02:25-0:02:45\`, mixed formats, whatever)

4. Hit ""RUN THE BLADES""

5. Boom. New timeline with only those segments, perfectly stitched together.



What used to take 30+ minutes now takes 10 seconds.



Works with any framerate (29.97, 59.94, 25, 30, 60fps...). No Python installation needed if you're on Windows - just download the .exe and go.



\*\*Completely free and open source:\*\*

[https://github.com/Uhlovic/Clip\_Assassin\_Resolve](https://github.com/Uhlovic/Clip_Assassin_Resolve)



Compatible with \*\*DaVinci Resolve 18+\*\* (Free or Studio).



If you deal with any kind of ""cut these specific parts"" workflow, this might save your sanity.

My wife and I don’t argue. We’re just a couple of busy entrepreneurs. Things just got comfortable and kinda boring. 

So one of my goals was to make my marriage like it was when we first started dating. 

And my critical task was to take 30 minutes every morning to have coffee on our front porch and just talk. No cell phones. No kids. No work. Just talk. 

At first she admitted that she felt it was annoying. But she was willing to do it to support me. 

Within a couple of weeks, our marriage had a night and day difference. It just sparked so much new life in our relationship. It’s really amazing how much change can occur in a relationship with a small amount of meaningful conversation every day. 

We now spend hours a day together and talk about all kinds of things, and she’s been joining me in my workouts, dieting and reading.

So I (18F) go to this coffeeshop everyday, and there’s this really pretty barista girl. Like. Really pretty. She’s soft and cool and always looks like she’s in a coming-of-age movie montage. I can’t think straight around her (not that I was doing that to begin with lmao).

It started with small things I thought were nothing, but now I’m spiraling because maybe they meant something??
	•	First time I noticed her, she literally stood up mid-convo when I came in. Like… stood up. No smile, just serious eye contact. It felt intense. I thought it was in my head but
	•	Next time, it was my birthday. She looked at me from the downstairs floor (they have a weird two-floor setup) and we made eye contact. She didn’t smile but it felt like something.
	•	Then randomly, she remembered my order: “Iced coffee, right?” Which she never did before. I kind of melted.
	•	A week later: “Iced coffee with vanilla, right?” With a smile and eye contact and everything. She looked so happy. It felt flirty. I was like oh god oh fuck.
	•	I got a major crush. Been spiraling ever since.

But then today,

She looked up when I came in, smiled (not the same way), said my order normally, but then barely looked at me again. No real smile when she gave me the drink, no eye contact, barely a word. Just… disinterested?

And now I don’t know what’s happening. Like I don’t know if:
	•	she used to maybe like me but thinks I’m not into her
	•	she never liked me and it was just customer service
	•	she’s over it
	•	or maybe she’s trying to act normal bc she likes me and I’ve been weirdly silent (bc I have. I’ve said literally nothing. I’ve just been making googly eyes like an idiot. But I have really bad social anxiety so idk) 

I want to say something like “your hair looks cute today” but I am SO scared it’ll be awkward or she’ll think I’m weird or she’ll tell her coworkers I’m obsessed 😭or it might be too friendly and not hinting I’m into her at all.

So pls internet I’m asking for your help:
	•	Is there a chance she liked me?
	•	Did I miss it by not doing anything?
	•	Am I making this up in my head?
	•	Should I compliment her or is that doing too much??

I really hope someone can share their thoughts / advice, I’ve never felt like this before and i don’t wanna mess it up.

1ove66t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OhlafTheBaker/comments/1ove66t/the_secret_to_a_perfect_thanksgiving_morning/,The Secret to a Perfect Thanksgiving Morning,"As the leaves fall and the air turns crisp here in Wisconsin, I find myself leaning into the comforts of the season. Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and it’s the perfect time to gather around a table with good company, a pot of strong coffee, and something sweet and warm from the oven.

The Danes have a word for this feeling: hygge (pronounced ""hoo-gah""). It’s not about perfection or anything fancy. It’s about the little things that make a moment special, like a warm home, hearty conversation, and a few delicious treats to share.

This Thanksgiving, I always turn to two seasonal favorites: the Brandy Old-Fashioned Kringle and the Thanksgiving Coffee Cake.

The Brandy Old-Fashioned Kringle is my way of blending a little Wisconsin spirit with my Danish heritage. I took the state’s most beloved cocktail and turned it into a pastry. Picture this: a touch of brandy, smooth caramel, and perfectly ripe cherries tucked into flaky, golden layers of pastry. Then it’s topped with vanilla icing kissed with orange zest. It’s indulgent, festive, and just the right kind of grown-up treat for a table full of family stories and clinking glasses.

My other go-to is the Thanksgiving Coffee Cake. It’s pure comfort in every bite. Starting with a delicious layer of smooth almond paste, followed by our scratch-made apple cinnamon filling, finished with ribbons of cranberry, buttery streusel, and a drizzle of honey glaze and icing. The result is a perfect balance of sweet, tart, and cozy, everything a Thanksgiving morning deserves.

When I host, I like to keep things simple. I brew a fresh pot of coffee, light a few candles, and let the scent of Kringle or coffee cake do the talking. There’s something magical about how those smells fill the house, making it feel warm and inviting, no matter how chilly it is outside.

How do you make your home feel cozy when it’s officially sweater season?

I have been a remote worker for several years (no location issues, any state is allowed) and have lived in Houston, D.C., and Ohio. My wife was previously laid off in D.C., and we moved back to Ohio (where we are both from) to Columbus temporarily.

Well, she received a fully remote (no state boundary) job, and we are not wanting to stay in Ohio. Although all of our familes are here, we do not enjoy it, and feel not as happy here.

We are both city people, enjoying walkability, access to parks, coffee shops, museums, and transit. Living in D.C., we used the Metro exclusively, not driving anywhere. 

Our current lease ends in the beginning of the summer, and we are trying to decide whether to move back to the DMV (which we loved) or to try a new area out. We really are considering Boston, but are unsure. The sticker price for rents/space does not surprise us, but we have never been to New England. We know we can rent ""cheaper"" LCOL city, or rural, but are happiest with the amenities of cities. 

Has anyone lived in these places, and what are your thoughts? We do not have children. 

Also, we were not fans of Houston's car centric-ness, and lack of amenities. Thanks!",1,1762974217.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,0.67,False

You can spin up a full app before your coffee gets cold. But once you start getting real traffic, that’s when you realize how fragile things can get.

When one of my projects passed **50k users**, a small migration mistake almost wiped half the data. That day taught me a few painful but valuable lessons:

1. **Back up your database.** Always. Even tiny schema changes can cause big problems. Test everything in **dev** before production. Tools like **Drizzle** migrate help keep migrations safe.
2. **Add logging early.** Don’t wait for users to report errors. Tools like **Sentry** will catch failures before Reddit does.
3. **Talk to your users.** Real users will tell you what’s working, what’s not, and what you never thought of building.
4. **Use version control seriously.** Separate **dev**, **staging**, and **production**. If you deploy straight to prod, you’re basically skydiving without a parachute.
5. **Track performance.** Even simple uptime checks help. Slow apps lose users faster than bad ones.

Replit is amazing for getting ideas off the ground fast, but once real users depend on it, you have to think like a CEO/CTO. A bit of discipline goes a long way toward avoiding panic deploys at midnight.

My alarm rang at 6:00. Senior day started early. Sleep had claimed me, but I was more tired than the day before.

I pitched myself out of bed and lumbered to the kitchenette. I almost fell asleep waiting on the coffee machine. I almost collapsed when I fell asleep in the shower. As I wrestled the morning, I admitted it was a fight I was going to lose. I won perfect attendance awards every year in grade school. My father never believed in sick days. That morning, I knew he was wrong.

I picked up my phone from where I threw it into the sheets. Bree had sent her morning briefing at 4:45. She survived on coffee and high-functioning anxiety. I texted back.

“Hey. Feeling sick. Can’t make it. Sorry.” Bree read the message immediately. I thought of calling her. It would have been the nice thing to do. The right thing. But I couldn’t bear to hear her voice. This time, there wouldn’t even be any anger to hide in. She would know something was wrong. I turned my phone on vibrate and tossed it on the couch.

I sat down and noticed that my head had stopped spinning. I hadn’t realized it had been reeling like what I have heard of hangovers. I didn’t remember drinking that much the night before, but the empty bottle judged me from bed.

Still, this wasn’t a hangover. It was less than that. And more. I didn’t just feel loopy. I felt like he was in the wrong place.

When I turned on the TV, the sound split my head with an axe. I turned down the volume, but the noise barely obeyed. Still, I needed the distraction. I clicked through the infomercials and syndicated sitcoms. Most people my age never even had a cord to cut, but Dove Hill local news and C-SPAN are free on cable. I haven’t watched anything else since those Saturday mornings with Bree.

During the hour’s changeover, local channel 3 airs low-budget ads for the dentist and the school and national spots for fast food and a new diabetes medication. The fifth ad was different though.

In it, a large man whose stomach was too big for his suit stood in front of a lot full of clearly used cars. The oversaturated light and amateur production value proved it was local, but there isn’t a used car dealership in 100 miles of Dove Hill. The man’s hair piece shook as he shouted his pitch. I felt nauseous watching it shiver.

“Hey, hey, hey! Come on down to Papa’s Playhouse where the low prices aren’t pretend!” My head cracked again as Papa’s shout made the TV impossibly louder. Under a slithering saxophone solo, the screen showed a line of cars that looked like they were manufactured well before the turn of the millennium. “Hurry quick because we aren’t hiding these deals! Seek them now before they’re gone!”

I breathed a sigh of relief when Papa left the screen. It was 7:00: time for the news. The music should have been the Muzak jingle that the station has used since the 1970s. Instead, it was Sunny Sandy singing her theme song. The piano that played along came from somewhere in my apartment.

By the time the ghostly piano played its last phrase, I was back in the center of the Square. No time had passed in the last day of my life. When I opened my eyes, Sandy’s were staring at me like I was a statue she was carving from stone.

“Now!” she said in a mechanical squee. “Where are my other friends?” It was time for another call-and-response. “Say it with me.”

After the compelled introduction, I didn’t even try to fight. I remembered my part. Together, we shouted, “Howdy dee! Howdy day! Where is everyone today?” When Sandy’s voice rose, it sounded like she was projecting to the last aisle of a crowded theatre.

The piano started up again. Its sound was distant. Was it still playing from my apartment? Or from the black above us? As its invisible mallets struck its hidden strings, the animals emerged from their rooms. One by one, they bounced towards Sandy and encircled her. I could tell that they had also learned to not struggle against their matriarch.

Maggie stood to my right; Tommy was to my left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. I realized I had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid. They each kept their characteristic shapes. Maggie, Tommy, and the pig on all fours; the owl and the chickens on their talons; and the rabbit on its haunches. They weren’t humans, but they were people. With hearts and minds they were clinging to under Sandy’s uncompromising benevolence. Even before I was brought to the Square, I knew that pain. These were my allies.

“Thank you for joining us, friends!” Sandy believed it was a kindness to pretend like they had a choice. In the past, one of them might have corrected her. Now they didn’t dare. “I’d like you to meet our new friend: Mikey!” The animals smiled at me with a commiserating kindness. “He’s a very good boy.” I didn’t want to know what Sandy would become if I wasn’t.

“Now what are we going to do today?” I remembered that this is where every episode really started. Every day in *Sunnyside Square* started with a game, and each had very specific rules. I always liked that part of the show. I looked around the circle expecting one of my friends to answer Sandy’s question. When their lips pinched in silent fear, I remembered that this wasn’t the Square I had known.

“Oh! I know!” Her voice was that of a fairytale princess who had become an authoritarian monarch. “We’ll play Hide and Seek!” The animals stood quiet for a fleeting moment before the light coming from Sandy’s eyes turned harsh with confident expectation. My friends cheered as demanded. I followed their lead.

The red rabbit raised his paw and asked eagerly, “Sandy! Sandy! Can I please help teach our new friend the rules?” I noticed his foot thumping anxiously.

“Oh! That is such a sunny idea!” Sunny said. “Thank you, Rupert! That will be a very nice thing to do!” Rupert concealed a flinch when she gave his head a firm tap.

“Now, do we all remember the rules? I’m going to close my eyes and count to 100. Then you’ll all hide somewhere you feel safe. Then I’ll come find you.” There was a threatening fist in the velvet glove of that promise. “Mikey, Rupert will teach you the rest.” She giggled eagerly.

The animals nodded politely, and I played along. Sandy placed her hands over her eyes like the young playmate she still should have been. “One, two—”

This was my chance. I broke through the circle and towards the imposing front door. I took a short sigh of relief when I found it unlocked. As I ran out, I looked on with confusion at my animal friends walking grudgingly to their hiding spots. Didn’t they want to leave too?

Rupert was the only one to match my speed. He called out to me as we ran out of the park. “Wait! Stop! That’s not how the game works. Not anymore…” I didn’t stop to listen.

I first tried to hide in the post office right across the street from Sandy’s house. I flung open the door and started to enter. I forgot about the black behind the buildings. I caught my foot just as it was about to fall into an abyss swirling with trails of dust. Catching my breath for only a moment, I slammed the door as I ran around the Square.

Rupert did his best to follow along. “Mikey, let me help you. You know I’m your friend.” I wanted to trust Rupert, but I couldn’t trust anyone—especially in the Square.

Sandy was coming. Her voice blared from her house like a tornado siren. “Twenty-two, twenty-three…”

I passed more doors into the void. One for a bakery that didn’t exist. Another for what looked like a school. Then a church with a golden plaque reading “St. Beatrice’s.” All the while, Rupert hopped frantically behind me. “Please…”

I only stopped when I came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. I threw myself through the door as its bell tingled above me. Rupert finally caught up when I was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From my hiding spot, I could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window. Her garden was filled with statues of kind-looking creatures that I chose to believe were animals.

Sandy’s voice shined on. “Sixty-six, sixty-seven…”

Rupert hopped up. With me crouching, we were almost nose to nose. “Thank you. I was trying to follow you.”

“You’re welcome?” Something old inside me knew I shouldn’t be afraid of Rupert, but it wasn’t safe to trust him. It has been years since I truly trusted anyone but Bree.

“Now listen,” Rupert continued. “Hiding like this is not going to work. That’s not how Hide and Seek works. Not now.” I eyed him suspiciously. “The Square is too small for that. It’s not just about hiding your body. It’s about hiding your feelings. You have to be sunny. If she sees you looking scared or upset or angry or anything else…” Rupert’s muzzle quivered.

“Then…what happens?”

“You’re Out.”

“Out? What does that mean?”

“Seventy-nine, eighty…”

Rupert huffed with frightened impatience. “We’re running out of time.” My survival instincts held me in place. My bones told me I should take up less space.

“Out,” Rupert explained desperately. “Into the black behind the buildings. It’s dark and dusty and—”

“Ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I come!”

I couldn’t move. Rupert matched his voice to the speed of his pounding feet. “Time and space don’t exist. It’s just you and the light beams too far above to see. You forget who you are: your thoughts, your feelings…even your name. Before long, you’re just…fine. Fine…but empty.”

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. I saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. I saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through us. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

I lunged from my hiding spot between the shelves and shouldered past Rupert. “I’m sorry. For everything.” I bolted out the door so narrowly that I could smell Sandy as she reached for me. She smelled like a candy-scented permanent marker.

I ran down the brick sidewalks and past more doors to Out. I didn’t know where I was going. I just had to get away from Sandy. As I turned the corner, my foot caught on the bend in the path. I tried to catch myself, but my elbow struck the ground. My arm vibrated down to the bone.

I heard Sandy’s heels walking up behind me. I couldn’t bear to look. “Oops! Did Mikey hurt himself? That’s what happens when you make mistakes. I’ll fix it.” Her sweetness made me want to vomit.",1,1762974004.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

This is my experience with the first day with no smokes, so far.","I’ve been in the psych ward 10+ times, I’m not lying about the mental health. My mental health just recently started getting a little better, as two months ago I went through a very traumatic situation and told myself I have to, change.. A lot of things about myself. I made the decision to live. I’m 21, change starts now. The way I was living before was a gateway to an early death. Why?


- smoking makes me crave very unhealthy food, at first it made me barely have an appetite, but now, it just makes me insatiably “starving”(craving) for gross, fattening food. Also alcohol, it makes me crave alcohol.

- chain smoking makes me tired and foggy brained, extremely un motivated to do anything, making exercise more difficult. After waking up, I couldn’t even go for a walk, or have a shower first thing most days.

Those are the main two things, and they concern me tons.

I started smoking when I was 13, moderately. Then when I hit 16/17, I was full on chain smoking.. till yesterday. 

I don’t know if it’s placebo, like my brain tricking me.. but this morning after not smoking yesterday evening and night, I woke up feeling more clear already! I had two cups of coffee, and took my dog for a speed, power walk around the pond to stretch our legs at 8am. Then I went home and made an egg, spinach wrap wit extra hot sauce lol. I hit a wave of feeling tired, because I’m quitting an addiction I’ve lived with since I was literally a kid, in middle school. I started looking for my old butts but couldn’t find any big enough to have more than like two puffs. I’m taking it hour by hour. Now, my energy is starting to go up again, right before noon. So I am going to finish getting myself ready, put some laundry in(was neglecting it for too long) and I think taking my dog for another power walk will distract me from cravings. 

I’ve never felt this self disciplined, and motivated in so very long. I think in a week or two, I’ll be ready to start looking for a job again as I’ll be on a solid routine by then. Hopefully:)",12,1762973996.0,quittingsmoking,0,1.0,False

\- A Red Bull that really gives you levitation because ""Red Bull gives you wings.""  
\- Crafting Sour Patch Kids by filling a crafting table with sugar; they scream when you eat them.  
\- An angry villager who chases you if you hit them and eventually drops burnable flesh.

I'm an optimistic, calm-but-occasionally-chaotic, gentle, curious, and creative guy. I love living a calm and stress-free life, except when my cats say no.

During the day I work as an engineer. After work you'll find me at the gym, reading, playing PC/PS5 games, working with my hands/creativity/DIY, watching movies and shows with friends, and listening to music. I love to cook (terrible baker though) and like to travel. I'm going to Sweden in December.

Especially strength training, books, and music are important to me. I just want to be strong and healthy (and also eat more food). I love escaping into fantasy worlds and I love learning from nonfiction books. Music has a special spot in my heart right now. I especially love rock/metalcore/punk/emotional&sad music/drum&bass/anything my brain approves of.

I'm a romantic at heart. My love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and making sure you're stocked up on snacks. For the right person, the kind of love I give is the kind you don't have to question and ""Baby, I won't let anything happen to you"". Great, I've called all of r4r baby already. Whoops.

I am childfree, monogamous, agnostic, a feminist, and I care a lot about neurodiversity and mental health. My guilty pleasures are Love is Blind and iced coffee with whipped cream.

I'd probably get along with a book nerd/gym mouse/cozy enjoyer/parttime adventurer. Someone that ""feels"" warm, even in text. Someone that practices open and honest communication and doesn't shy away from being vulnerable. Around 30-35 or so (not a hard limit), and preferably from Europe.

I get daily exercise, I’m doing OMAD, and I’ve completely cut out carbs and added sugar (except for my morning coffee and nightly diet tea).

It's been a very, *very* long time since I've written a letter to you.. but I think today would be perfect for that.


I want to ask you how you are; how you're doing?


How are you holding up with all these changes? With the weather turning colder, with the leaves falling from the trees as the world prepares its slumber for the winter months that are coming, I think fondly of you, and who you used to be.


I want to let you know I see the steps you've taken and the way you've grown after everything that has happened. To give you a little external validation hard won after the battles you fought; the ones you didn't think you would win.


I know you surprised yourself staying strong when you thought you wouldn't be able to.. especially after experiencing what could only be described as going through a personal hell.


I've heard that you're sleeping lots in order to escape the depression that you feel, and I want you to know that's okay. Not everyone will be as understanding..  but I am after having gone through everything you did with you. I know it's easier to go to sleep earlier with the days growing shorter and the nights growing longer. I know that you haven't been dreaming as much as you used to, which may not necessarily be a bad thing with your medication.


I want you to be able to take a moment to truly recognize just how far you have come, from those days you were afraid to sleep because you weren't sure if you were going to wake up. How far you are from those days where you would drink coffee after coffee, tea after tea, and soda upon soda. I remember what you were like, paranoid and terrified of the world and not being able to see yourself as a part of it. 


I know that you've been applying for jobs, and are really on the look out for something that would fit you. I know that you're open to any sort of survival job that would come your way, hoping to be able to keep a roof over your head and food in your belly.


I know that you worked hard to put the weight back on and that you still struggle with how you percieve yourself after having gotten as skinny and as emaciated as you did. I know it's still difficult to look at yourself in the mirror and be forgiving. I know you scrutinize every aspect of yourself. I know that you have difficulty leaving the pimples on your face alone and that you should probably do a better job of not damaging your skin.


I know that you're on day four of no cigarettes at all and I know that you're still vaping and only plan on going to until the cartridge runs out. I know that you're on day sixty-something of being cannabis free.


I know that you recently were able to have dinner with someone you once thought of as a sister and a friend but have come to realize that she is in fact neither. I feel the sadness you feel as you came to recognize the fact that you were some sort of weird game to her and that if someone loves you they will not treat you that way. I know that you're still experiencing some difficulties and grief in having lost what you thought was a close relationship.


The thing is, is that if someone cared they wouldn't go out of their way to torture you the way she did. You were a little foolish in thinking that she didn't have anyone, which is why you kept her secrets and she did not keep yours. I know you think about deleting her texts all of the time and her messages, but I'd recommend you hold onto them for a while longer. I know you feel guilt not saying what you should have and having better boundaries, but its probably for the best that you kept all that to yourself. You've seen how she was able to pull the strings and manipulate others and still continues to do so. Someone who tells you that they think someone is not a good person and turns around and spends the day with them is not someone you want to be able to influence your life. 


On top of that, the fact that she hides you from the world to suit her own purposes and tries to needle you as much as she did and still tries to do is not someone you want in your life. I know that she'd only pretend to be in your corner until it suited her otherwise. Like how she told you your favorite sweater did not look good on you. Like how she told you that you need to learn how to do your makeup. Like how she told you that you need to change your music tastes, or how you dress, or how she pressured you into drinking when you didn't want to. 


It's going to take some time to heal from this loss of friendship, but in a way you've already started this journey back when your world collapsed on itself. There was a reason why you didn't reach out to her, why you ran and hid from her when she stopped by your house, why you wrote ""*don't trust sister*"" in your unsteady hand. You couldn't handle her lies and half truths and could not tolerate it as it weighed heavily on your soul. 


I wouldn't worry too much about what happens to her going further, as I can promise you that she will recieve the recognition for what she deserves. All you can do is continue your healing journey and keep showing people how you show up for yourself every day, how each day you improve, how you grow and transform every single damned day for the better. 


And just so you know, my favorite *human*.. you are not a liability, you are an *asset*, and the right people can and will see that. You've got so much to offer the world, so hold your head up. Not many people could have survived what you did and make it through to the other side.


I'm proud of you, little one.

### **WHY THIS MATTERS (AND WHY I BUILT IT)**
It's been said it a million times:
**""Your network = your net worth.""**

But here’s the truth: **Most people don’t have access.** You’re not sliding into Mark Cuban’s DMs. You’re not grabbing coffee with the CEO of your dream company. And if you’re trying to break into a new industry? Forget it—you’re stuck Googling ""how to network"" while the people *actually winning* are **one conversation away from their next big move.**

**So I fixed it.**

This isn’t about replacing real connections. It’s about **removing the fear of the first step.**
- Scared to talk to that VP in your interview? **Practice with their AI twin first.**
- Struggling to sell to a stubborn exec? **Ask their digital clone what they *actually* care about.**
- Stuck in a career rut or have a bad manager? **Get a virtual pep talk from someone who’s been there.**

💰 **B2B Sales:** Sales teams are **running ""focus groups""** with AI versions of their buyers’ leadership teams. *""What keeps you up at night?""* → **Boom. Customized pitch.**

🎤 **Companion Mode:** Lonely? Stuck? **Add your favorite creator or influencer** and chat like they’re your hype-man.

🛠️ **Product Dev:** **Talk to your ideal users**—even if they’d never reply to you IRL. *""Would you pay for this?""* → **Instant feedback.**

🧠 **Career Coach:** Hate your boss? **Create a mentor** from someone you admire and ask, *""How would you handle this?""* → **Mindset shift in 5 minutes.**

### **WHY THIS WORKS (AND WHY YOU’LL LOVE IT)**
1️⃣ **No more ""analysis paralysis.""** Stuck? **Ask the person who’s already solved it.**
2️⃣ **Confidence hack.** Introverts in our beta went from **""I’ll never speak up""** to **""I just led a meeting""** in **one week.**

Then I saw a Facebook ad: “Unlock your inner billionaire with AI.” Boom. My life changed.

I sold my last possession — a slightly melted air fryer — to buy the “VIP Platinum Quantum Mastermind” ticket for $7,997.

Day 1: Tony yelled “STATE!” and I blacked out. When I woke up, my credit score was somehow 830.

Day 2: Dean said “You don’t need an algorithm, you ARE the algorithm.” I cried. My tears backtested at a 40% ROI.

Day 3: The AI tool wrote me a business plan that literally started printing money. My printer is now my CFO.

Fast-forward two weeks and I’m taking Zoom calls from a private jet that only flies in circles because “momentum.”

If you’re skeptical — don’t be. The only thing separating you from success is 13 easy payments of $997 and a willingness to yell “YES!” at random intervals.

Imagine a group of friends from different neighborhoods, each with their own coffee machine. They all want to develop the ultimate coffee recipe, but no one wants to share their coffee machines or taste preferences with the others. This is where federated learning comes in – a collaborative approach to machine learning where multiple parties contribute to model training without sharing their local data. In this coffee machine analogy, each friend trains their own local model using their personal coffee machine data, then shares the model updates with their friends.

These updates are then aggregated to create an improved global model, which can be used by all friends for their own coffee machine data without needing to share the data itself. This decentralized approach to model training preserves data privacy while still allowing for the creation of accurate and robust machine learning models.

So I (18F) go to this coffeeshop everyday, and there’s this really pretty barista girl. Like. Really pretty. She’s soft and cool and always looks like she’s in a coming-of-age movie montage. I can’t think straight around her (not that I was doing that to begin with lmao).

It started with small things I thought were nothing, but now I’m spiraling because maybe they meant something??
	•	First time I noticed her, she literally stood up mid-convo when I came in. Like… stood up. No smile, just serious eye contact. It felt intense. I thought it was in my head but
	•	Next time, it was my birthday. She looked at me from the downstairs floor (they have a weird two-floor setup) and we made eye contact. She didn’t smile but it felt like something.
	•	Then randomly, she remembered my order: “Iced coffee, right?” Which she never did before. I kind of melted.
	•	A week later: “Iced coffee with vanilla, right?” With a smile and eye contact and everything. She looked so happy. It felt flirty. I was like oh god oh fuck.
	•	I got a major crush. Been spiraling ever since.

But then today,

She looked up when I came in, smiled (not the same way), said my order normally, but then barely looked at me again. No real smile when she gave me the drink, no eye contact, barely a word. Just… disinterested?

And now I don’t know what’s happening. Like I don’t know if:
	•	she used to maybe like me but thinks I’m not into her
	•	she never liked me and it was just customer service
	•	she’s over it
	•	or maybe she’s trying to act normal bc she likes me and I’ve been weirdly silent (bc I have. I’ve said literally nothing. I’ve just been making googly eyes like an idiot. But I have really bad social anxiety so idk) 

I want to say something like “your hair looks cute today” but I am SO scared it’ll be awkward or she’ll think I’m weird or she’ll tell her coworkers I’m obsessed 😭or it might be too friendly and not hinting I’m into her at all.

So pls internet I’m asking for your help:
	•	Is there a chance she liked me?
	•	Did I miss it by not doing anything?
	•	Am I making this up in my head?
	•	Should I compliment her or is that doing too much??

I really hope someone can share their thoughts / advice, I’ve never felt like this before and i don’t wanna mess it up.

1ovdl0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ovdl0m/what_do_the_cards_say/,What Do The Cards Say?,"Edward didn’t believe in mysticism. He believed in observation. The old tarot deck he used wasn’t sacred to him. It was a tool, a way to study people who came to him desperate for patterns that made their chaos make sense. His apartment smelled of coffee gone cold and candle wax burned to the stub. The cards were soft from overuse, their edges fraying like nerves. Edward liked that. He said the more fingerprints on something, the more truth it held. To his clients, he was a man who could see the hidden threads of their lives. In reality, he was tugging those threads until everything came undone.

One night, a man came in. A lawyer, nervous and sweating through his collar. Edward laid out the cards slowly, deliberately. The Tower. The Devil. The Ten of Swords. Each one hit the table like a small warning. “You’ve built something crooked,” he said quietly. “When it collapses, you’ll be underneath it.” The man tried to laugh, but Edward watched his pupils shrink. He always noticed that, the precise second they believed him. Three days later, the lawyer fell from his office balcony. Police said it was suicide. Edward just poured himself another drink and noted the result in his worn leather journal.

He told himself it wasn’t murder. He never touched anyone. He simply guided them to their own edges and waited. He was fascinated by how predictably fragile people were, how easily a suggestion could become destiny. He fine-tuned his readings, his tone, his silence, the order of the cards to plant the idea of an ending that would feel inevitable to his clients. By the time they died, it wasn’t him pulling the strings. It was the story they thought had already been written.

One night, out of curiosity, he decided to read for himself. The cards came faster than usual, as if they were waiting. Death. Judgment. The Fool. He frowned. The Fool’s face seemed different, almost smirking. The air in the room felt too still. Somewhere in the apartment, the window creaked open on its own. Edward reached for his recorder to document the reading, but before he could speak, the deck slipped from his hands. When they found him the next morning, the cards were scattered across the floor, the Fool resting face-up on his chest.",33,1762972984.0,shortscarystories,6,0.95,False

where did you go today?
 i know you're still there, lurking within me.
you're always with me, i know this now

you are me

are you taking a mental health break today?
  are you getting too exhausted from fighting?
are you too tired of being misunderstood? 

  so am i

i know burnout is waiting it's turn at the helm
  we can't let that happen this time, though

we have to face facts:
  it's you and me vs the world

i think maybe we can do this, 
  what do you think? 

we have our beasts of burden that we share
  your friends in kind
 like your bestie, logic-and-reality-based

i know it's hard
  we're all hurting in here

but you have to get up and try
  just like i do

i need you.
you help make me who i am: fun, carefree, and loving
  even if some people choose to call those bad things:
 grandiose
quixotic
  foolhardy

i know you
  i know you mean well
 i know you lash because you're so misunderstood and hurt

one day, my dear friend mania,
  one day, i hope you will get to show your true self to the world

the good you, that is.

  because the good you?
well i think you're pretty amazing
  you're kinda cool in your own ways

i hope one day at least one other person in this world
will come to see, know, understand, accept, and embrace you
 and know that you're really not all bad

and i hope they'll see me like that too

On October 22nd, I (26F) woke up and the right side of my face was paralyzed. I thought I slept weird. I went to work and my colleagues told me I should get it checked out, luckily I live and work close to the hospital so I went immediately.

In terms of pre-symptoms, I didn't really have many. The day before, my left eye twitched a bit (which I assumed was from drinking too much coffee) and I had slight jaw pain on the right side of my face.

I live in Canada, sometimes there is a long wait to be seen, but it was relatively quick for me. The nurses did an EKG and a blood test and other tests to confirm it wasn't a stroke. I was then seen by the Dr who did more stroke tests (testing strength in both legs and arms) and who diagnosed me with Bell's Palsy.

The Dr gave me 50mg x 10 days of prednisone (steroid) and 1000mg x 21 pills of valacyclovir (anti viral). I started taking both immediately.

I took some sick leave from work and for the first 5 days was sleeping a lot (10+ hours...). I had minor improvements in my face everyday. I am lucky to be able to work from home, after taking 2 days of sick leave and returning to work, I did reduced hours for a few days due to my lack of energy.

During my recovery, I walked most days for a minimum of 20 mins, took an iron, B12 and vitamin C supplement. I avoided caffeine until I was done the steroid and used a heat pad on my face for discomfort. I didn't start doing face messages until the second week of my recovery. I still don't do that many- rest is key.

Today (Nov 12)- my face is about 85% recovered- I can force a blink and my mouth is more or less normal. I think getting the medicine ASAP was key in me recovering quickly

I cover my eye with an eyepatch when going outside and tape my eye shut at night after putting in gel eye drops. I went to the hospital eye doctor (referred from ER) last week to make sure there were no complications with my recovery. I am avoiding alcohol until my face fully recovers (I dont drink much anyways so this is not the biggest deal for me)

The prednisone made me very thirsty and hungry and I think also led to some headaches and digestion issues. I still feel like I am constantly hungry and thirsty even though I am eating and drinking normal amounts (for me).

I went back to the gym for the first time yesterday! I used to work out 6x per week, so I was happy to be able to return. I did 10-15 pounds lighter on all my lifts and moved very slowly and intentionally.

I am considering doing acupuncture in the future, I have done it in the past for general health and wellness, I don't see it as key to recovering fully and I want to give my body the chance to do what it needs to do.

Anyways, all to say that this has been a very interesting experience. It was really hard the first week and I cried everytime I saw my face. But eventually I realized that there is nothing I  can do and just need to stay positive and focus on recovering- so that is where I am now!",1,1762972484.0,BellsPalsy,0,1.0,False

It's basically just taking notes at meetings, but with some legal flair that keeps your business protected.

**TL;DR:** Corporate minutes are your company's official diary of important decisions. Keep them accurate, store them safely, and document the big stuff.

# Why Corporate Minutes Matter More Than You Think

Think of corporate minutes like a protective shield for your business. When someone tries to sue your company or challenge your corporate status, these records help demonstrate that you're running a legitimate corporation (not just treating it like your personal piggy bank). Without proper minutes, you risk losing that precious corporate liability protection, and nobody wants their personal assets on the line.

The good news? You don't need to document every coffee or lunch break. Focus on the decisions that actually move your business forward.

# Tip #1: Document What Actually Matters

**Record the big decisions, skip the small talk.** Your minutes should capture:

* **Major business decisions** (hiring key employees, taking loans, signing big contracts)
* **Financial resolutions** (approving budgets, authorizing expenditures over a certain amount)
* **Structural changes** (appointing officers, changing bylaws, issuing stock)
* **Compliance matters** (annual resolutions, regulatory approvals)

Keep it business-focused and you'll save time while staying compliant.

# Tip #2: Follow a Simple But Consistent Format

**Create a template and stick with it.** Every set of minutes should include:

* Date, time, and location of the meeting
* Who attended (and who was absent)
* What decisions were made
* Who voted how on important matters
* When the meeting ended

Pro tip: Start each meeting by approving the previous meeting's minutes. It's like proofreading your work: you'll catch mistakes before they become problems.

# Tip #3: Store Everything Safely and Accessibly

**Your corporate records are only as good as your ability to find them later.** Create a system that works for your team:

* Keep physical copies in your corporate record book
* Maintain digital backups in a secure, organized folder
* Make sure key people know where to find everything
* Store records in accordance with your state’s requirements - this may be at your principal place of business or a secure digital location

# Making It Simple: When to Get Professional Help

Taking corporate minutes isn't rocket science, but getting the legal details right can feel overwhelming, especially when you're juggling a million other business priorities. Many business owners find that working with professionals who understand corporate compliance takes the guesswork out of the process.

Professional services can help you set up proper templates, ensure you're documenting everything correctly, and even provide ongoing support as your business grows. It's like having a knowledgeable friend who actually enjoys reading corporate law (yes, those people exist!).

We got extra blueberry cream cheese syrup and extra whip cream, it was all simply divine. The potato goat cheese grits were freaking good. The home fries were crispy and seasoned well and so yummy dunked in chup. 10/10 would eat here again! And price also reasonable $10-$25 for per person, that is totally worth it.

2. Eggs Up Grill: I go there sometimes when I’m in a hurry. Simple, ni ordered a keto egg plate. Service is quick, and here paid close to $20-$25, thats good at price.

4. Harry’s Breakfast Pancakes: Pretty good. Food came out hot, portions were big. We paid around $20-$30 per person. Not bad at all. Servers were sweet and checked in often. I’d go back.

Creating a thriving, sustainable vegetable garden at home is one of the most rewarding ways to connect with nature, enjoy fresh produce, and reduce your environmental footprint. Beyond just growing vegetables, a sustainable garden nurtures the soil, conserves water, attracts beneficial insects, and fosters a harmonious ecosystem. Whether you’re a complete beginner or have tried your hand at gardening before, we can guide you toward building a flourishing garden that’s both productive and eco-friendly.

Sustainability in gardening isn’t about perfection—it’s about making smart choices that benefit the plants, the environment, and your lifestyle. With a few practical strategies, we can grow vegetables that taste better, last longer, and support a healthier planet. Here are ten actionable tips to help you create a sustainable vegetable garden at home.

# 1)) Start With Thoughtful Garden Planning

Before planting a single seed, take a moment to plan your garden layout and consider your long-term goals. Choosing the right location is essential. Most vegetables need at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight each day, so a sunny spot is ideal. If space is limited, we can explore vertical gardening or container options to maximize productivity without sacrificing sustainability.

Consider accessibility as well. Placing the garden near a water source or your kitchen makes daily maintenance easier and encourages consistent care. Think about your garden’s size—starting small can prevent feeling overwhelmed, and we can always expand as confidence and experience grow.

Planning isn’t just about space—it’s about choosing the right crops. A sustainable vegetable garden benefits from diversity. Mixing leafy greens, root vegetables, and climbing plants not only improves yield but also helps deter pests and diseases naturally. Companion planting, like pairing tomatoes with basil, can enhance growth and flavor while reducing chemical interventions.

# 2)) Focus on Healthy, Living Soil

Healthy soil is the foundation of a sustainable vegetable garden. Without rich, nutrient-dense soil, plants struggle to grow, and we might rely on fertilizers that can harm the environment. Soil health starts with testing. Simple soil test kits can measure pH and nutrient levels, helping us identify what amendments are needed.

Adding organic matter is key. Compost, aged manure, leaf mold, and other natural amendments improve soil structure, retain moisture, and provide essential nutrients. Mulching around plants not only reduces weeds but also prevents water evaporation and gradually enriches the soil as it decomposes.

A simple rule for sustainability: treat the soil as a living system. Avoid over-tilling, rotate crops, and allow the soil to rest between planting cycles. These practices maintain microbial health, reduce erosion, and keep our garden productive year after year.

# 3)) Choose Vegetables Wisely

Not all vegetables thrive equally in every climate or space. Selecting crops suited to local conditions makes gardening more rewarding and sustainable. Cool-season crops like kale, spinach, and carrots flourish in spring and fall, while tomatoes, peppers, and zucchini prefer warm summer conditions.

We should also embrace crop diversity. Planting a variety of vegetables reduces the risk of total crop failure and attracts beneficial insects. Companion planting is another powerful tool—for example, planting onions near carrots can deter pests, and marigolds near tomatoes can repel nematodes.

Heirloom varieties are often more resilient and flavorful, while hybrids can offer higher yields. Experimentation is encouraged: try a mix of both and see what performs best in your garden. Over time, you’ll learn which vegetables thrive and which need special care.

# 4)) Efficient Watering Practices

Water is essential, but it’s a precious resource. A sustainable vegetable garden uses water wisely to keep plants healthy while minimizing waste. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses are excellent tools because they deliver water directly to the roots, where it’s needed most.

Watering in the early morning reduces evaporation and helps prevent fungal issues. Collecting rainwater in barrels or tanks is another sustainable approach that can cut utility costs and reduce dependency on municipal water.

Observing plants is critical. Wilted leaves or dry soil are signals that watering routines need adjustment. By paying attention and using efficient systems, we conserve water while ensuring the garden thrives.

# 5)) Embrace Composting and Organic Fertilizers

A sustainable vegetable garden thrives on nutrient cycling. Composting is a natural way to recycle kitchen scraps, garden clippings, and other organic waste into nutrient-rich soil amendments. We can compost fruit peels, coffee grounds, eggshells, and leaves to reduce waste and improve soil fertility.

Organic fertilizers, like compost tea, fish emulsion, or seaweed extract, provide essential nutrients without harming the ecosystem. Avoid synthetic chemicals whenever possible, as they can leach into groundwater and damage soil microbes.

Over time, a combination of composting and natural fertilizers creates a self-sustaining system, reducing the need for external inputs and promoting healthier, more resilient plants.

# 6)) Manage Pests and Diseases Naturally

Pests and diseases are part of gardening life, but sustainable practices offer natural solutions. Encouraging beneficial insects, like ladybugs, lacewings, and bees, helps maintain balance in the garden. These insects prey on pests and pollinate crops, boosting productivity naturally.

We can also use companion planting, physical barriers like row covers, and homemade sprays from garlic, neem oil, or mild soap to deter harmful insects. Crop rotation is another effective strategy—it prevents soil-borne diseases from building up and disrupts pest life cycles.

Instead of fearing pests, we embrace them as part of the ecosystem, learning to manage populations sustainably and with minimal intervention.

# 7)) Practice Crop Rotation and Seasonal Planting

Planting the same crops in the same spot year after year can deplete soil nutrients and increase vulnerability to pests. Crop rotation, the practice of alternating plant families each season, improves soil health and reduces disease risks.

Seasonal planting ensures that vegetables grow when conditions are optimal. Cool-season crops in spring and fall, warm-season crops in summer—this rhythm keeps the garden productive and reduces stress on plants. By observing local weather patterns and adjusting planting schedules, we create a resilient and sustainable garden system.

# 8)) Incorporate Perennials and Pollinator-Friendly Plants

Perennials, like asparagus, rhubarb, or herbs such as rosemary and thyme, reduce the need for yearly replanting and create long-term productivity. They’re a sustainable choice because they require less maintenance once established and enrich garden biodiversity.

Pollinator-friendly flowers, including marigolds, sunflowers, and nasturtiums, attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators essential for vegetable production. A garden that supports pollinators not only boosts yields but also contributes to local ecosystems and wildlife health.

# 9)) Harvest Regularly and Maintain Your Garden

A sustainable vegetable garden requires consistent care. Regular harvesting keeps plants productive and prevents overripe vegetables from attracting pests. Monitoring plant health, pruning, and thinning crowded plants improves air circulation and growth.

Weeding is another essential task. Mulch helps, but occasional hand-pulling prevents weeds from competing for nutrients and water. By maintaining the garden proactively, we create a thriving system that rewards effort with abundant, healthy produce.

# 10)) Embrace Experimentation and Learning

Sustainability is a journey, not a destination. Every garden is unique, and what works for one gardener might not work for another. We should feel free to experiment with different crops, layouts, soil amendments, and watering methods.

Keeping a gardening journal helps track successes and lessons learned. Note which plants thrived, which pests appeared, and what adjustments made the biggest difference. Over time, this knowledge builds a personalized approach to a sustainable vegetable garden.

Remember, gardening is as much about enjoying the process as it is about harvesting produce. Celebrate small victories, learn from mistakes, and cultivate a sense of connection to nature.

# Conclusion

A sustainable vegetable garden at home is more than just a source of fresh food—it’s a practice that benefits our environment, health, and well-being. By planning thoughtfully, nurturing soil, conserving water, embracing diversity, and experimenting along the way, we create a resilient, productive garden that can thrive year after year.

Starting a sustainable vegetable garden doesn’t require perfection—it requires curiosity, consistency, and care. With these ten tips, we can grow vegetables that nourish our bodies, protect our planet, and bring joy into our daily lives. There’s nothing quite like tasting a fresh tomato you’ve grown yourself or seeing a garden flourish under your care. Sustainable gardening is a journey worth taking, and every small step counts.",1,1762972011.0,LifeStylenaireGreen,0,1.0,False

So this month started out great. Work’s been busy, and I told myself I “deserved” a break, no cooking, no dishes, just easy takeout until life slowed down. I wasn’t ordering anything crazy either, just quick stuff, $12 here, $18 there, and maybe a coffee run in between. It didn’t *feel* like much.

Then rent day hit. I opened my bank app, saw the number, and genuinely thought there was a glitch. My entire rent fund was hundreds short. I went through my statements and realized I had spent almost $600 on food in three weeks. I don’t even remember half the meals. It’s like my stomach had amnesia but my wallet definitely didn’t.

I had to pull from my small emergency fund to cover rent, and it sucked. I felt so dumb because I’m usually responsible, I pay on time, I don’t splurge often. But this month showed me how easy it is to slide into chaos when you stop paying attention.

Since then, I’ve been rebuilding my habits. I started budgeting properly again and tracking every expense, even the small ones that don’t seem like they matter. I also started using a debit card that reports to credit bureaus, so at least my regular spending now helps build credit instead of just draining my account. It’s forcing me to be more aware of what’s going out and when.

So I want to run away as an adult after my Birthday on January 8th. So I would leave that Friday.

Should I do it? I’m highly thinking about just trying. I live in Rhode Island currently and would go to Massachusetts as it’s close enough for me to walk there. I Only food stamps which I can hopefully get a copy of! I’ve had 5 jobs recently but they were mostly seasonal besides Amazon. I hope to work for Amazon again soon when I get to MA. They have plenty of open job listings there. So I’m sure that I would find one. I’m hoping! I have a debit card, So I can get direct deposit whenever I work for Amazon again and as it’s already set up.

I know. I should have saved up better when I was working. But I didn’t. I will have a new job when I leave soon hopefully.

I could try to throw a bag out the window as I am leaving, Take it with me on my walk out of here. I plan to stop by the DHS Office for food stamps, and ask them for a copy of my card. I’ve done that before, But it’s been a while. At least I will have some of my own food to survive on until I get that job.

I just want to get out of here so badly now. I’m not willing to wait anymore. I’m tired of being here and I don’t like it. I’m done living here.

I would leave now but I want to enjoy the holidays with family. It’s nothing they did. It’s where I currently live with roommates. I hate it here.

I plan to hang out at the mall or coffee shops when I get there.
