1i51wov,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaribouCoffee/comments/1i51wov/please_help_ive_been_trying_to_figure_out_recipe/,please help!!! I’ve been trying to figure out Recipe for so long at Caribou,"For context, I have been a campfire lover since the day I tried coffee, which was five years ago. When I was younger, I used to always love the blended campfire, but as I got older, I wanted more of a coffee flavor than rather an ice cream so I started getting the iced campfire. I have been getting the same drink from Caribou for the past four years. It’s my favorite drink at one point I was going almost every day of the week and so I decided enough is enough. I really need to get my own coffee maker so I can save some money! I got the Breville barista, which is a pretty expensive coffee machine. I’ve had it for about a year and I just can’t seem to make the flavor I want. I have gone on Reddit before asking for advice. Every time I go to Caribou I order a medium iced campfire, with milk chocolate, add an extra shot of espresso, and put less milk and more ice in it. I love the campfire, but sometimes it’s a very light color (because they put too much milk) and I like my coffee really dark and strong. I haven’t been able to figure out my coffee machine. It’s very frustrating. I want to get a close flavor even though I know I won’t ever be able to get it perfect, but I can’t seem to even get a close flavor to what I want. currently, I have the Breville barista coffee machine, Toasted Marshmallow Monin syrup, and chocolate sauce. I know the Caribou chocolate syrup is a private label and so I have tried many different chocolate syrups out. I started off with Hershy’s which everyone said not to use. So then I switched to Ghirardelli which I didn’t like either! After that I had bought a more expensive kind, Hollander chocolate sauce. Nothing seems to get the flavor even close to what I get when I go to Caribou. I have the Crossfox espresso beans which is what they use in the drink. Trust me I have asked multiple people, and they all say the same thing. If I have all these ingredients and a pretty good machine, why does the flavor taste completely off????? I just don’t get it. It’s so frustrating. I took a break for a few months and now I want to start to use it again I bought three more different syrup flavors. I’m starting to give up on this specific flavor I want, I might just try to branch out and make a different kind of drink. I just really was hoping I could figure out a close flavor to what I really love, which is the iced campfire. Someone HELP PLEASE🙏🏼😕",1,1737303031.0,CaribouCoffee,0,1.0,False

1i51u5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1i51u5k/i_stuck_with_an_information_diet_and_got_these/,I stuck with an information diet and got these unbelievable results!,"I'm sharing this because a decades-long information diet has come home to roost, and I thought some of you might like the story.

Background: I'm mid-50s F. Both parents were/are narcissistic in their behavior (no diagnoses—Ndad was a shrink, so clearly there couldn't be anything wrong with any of us! /s). Ndad was kind of a classic attention/resource hog who did things his way even if it killed him—which it actually did a couple of years ago because irony is not dead (though Ndad is). Nmom is the martyr type who cared much more about what outsiders thought than what her kids actually needed. I was NC for five years of blessed peace, but a family crisis made me have to contact them again, and I have endured it since.

Ndad died, I found a retirement community for Nmom, and I do her shopping, take her to doctor appointments, and generally manage her life, but I don't have to see her unless there's a need, so it's worth it. Oh, and I subsidize her rent and fees because Ndad of course left them pretty much penniless except for social security. 

Nmom was the type who couldn't keep a secret—ever—and I was on both the telling and the told-on end of that. She also needs to stick her nose into whatever I'm doing and thinks she's too special for boundaries. EXAMPLES: 

* I needed my first bra, and instead of taking me shopping, she told the neighbors to get me one for Christmas, which I opened at the building Christmas party. 
* More recently, a young family member had a drastic mental health crisis and their parent called Ndad in his professional capacity to get advice. Nmom badgered him until he told her what it was about. She calls me on a pretense to come over so she can stage-whisper it to me because, as she said, ""I needed someone to tell."" I blew up because now I knew, but I had to pretend not to, and I care very much for the person in crisis. She didn't understand why *her* emotional need wasn't my primary concern. 
* Until I was in my 30s, I endured phone calls that began with ""Don't tell X I told you, but..."" Eventually, I learned to say, ""then don't tell me"" and hang up.
* Once social media was a thing, she went through my friends lists and any name she recognized, she sent a friend request. This includes people from my elementary school and high school years and current friends who liked or responded to her comments. Of course, I blocked and then unfriended her, which was a whole drama.

I learned to put her on an information diet decades before I even learned that term. She gets told only things that affect her, and as possible, gets told after the fact.

Here's the delightful email I got on New Year's Day 2025. Important info for understanding it: Nmom grew up in Europe but immigrated here 70 YEARS AGO. She still refers to her village in Europe as ""home,"" which is a whole other issue. She never bothered to learn about American culture, which was especially hard when we were teens. I was the reason my younger sibling had anything like a normal adolescence. Also, I am named me after a relative who died long before I was born, and nmom really expected me to be a reincarnation of that person: sweet, timid, saintly, unambitious. I am none of those things. Ladies and gentlemen, my mother:

>OP, nobody could have better taken care of my physical well being  but you, but I hardly know you as my daughter. I never remember sitting somewhere nice and having a cup of coffee, just the two of us. Maybe it is not an American thing. I don't even know your favorite color.I most likely made many mistakes as a mom, the first one was,  giving you the wrong name and I misspelled ""I love you"" in many ways. I catch a hug when you are here, as it has never been a free gift and it makes me sad.Have a healthy year, filled with love and laughter and joy. love mom

I was at once pissed off and proud of myself. My spouse laughed for I swear to god ten minutes when I shared it because the n-fishing is so transparent.

Nope, mom, it is not my job to fill you in on the last 50+ years of my life because you couldn't be bothered until now. The reason I have such a good relationship with my own adult kid (Nmom is HUGELY envious) is that I took an interest and took her passions seriously—however ephemeral they were. I kept her secrets even when Nmom badgered me to know things she had no right to. I let her come to me rather than barging into her life with my needs and opinions.

I am a cypher to my mother, and it is such a relief. My own little family is healthy and open with each other because there is trust. DOCTORS WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK: Don't tell your Ns who you are.

I was the same weight for most of my adult life until I hit my forties. Then all of a sudden, 2-3lbs a year were making themselves at home on my body. It's not a lot, but over the years, it adds up. I'm now officially, for the first time in my life, overweight.

I have ADHD so dieting / meal planning / calorie counting = immediate overwhelm. I'm hoping IF, which has clearer boundaries (eat or don't eat) can help me reverse the trend and lose a few lbs. 

Full transparency: I've actually tried IF before, but my fasts were erratic and I relied too much on coffee, which wasn't great for my anxiety. 

This time I'm being much more gentle on myself: started with 14:10 on the weekend, moved to 15:9, and hope to settle into 16:8 when I'm ready.

I'm also using a tracker, which I'm finding super motivating, as I can track and reward my long-term consistency, rather than just challenging myself to go as long as possible without food.

(I know lots of people on this sub do longer and more intense fasts, but honestly...I'm not good with failure. I'd rather start 'small' and set myself up for success, even if it takes longer.)

I already work out 6 days a week so hopefully that will help me to maintain my bone and muscle density. 

I've asked myself for a month's commitment, and if it feels good, we'll go another month. And then another. But I'm trying not to think too far down the line. Slow and steady wins the race. 

In the last week I've lost 1.5lbs and an inch off my waist, which is exactly the kind of pace I'm hoping for.

1i51r3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i51r3h/what_should_i_do_help_i_dont_know_how_to_act/,What should i do? help... i dont know how to act,"My Girlfriend (lest just call her **EL** (F24)) and I(M24) just broke up, 3 days ago. She broke up with me and but i like to think about it as it was a mutual decision, because we were talking about this for some time now and it just happen. Now i need advice from someone what to do, but first let me tell you the details.   
I was really in love with EL, i had other relationships before and even longer than this one, and i always thought i was already in love, but when i met EL i had my life and head all turned around and i really found out what ""love"" really means, i learned a lot in that relationship, and it really breaks my heart that it is gone now.   
**THE reason:**  
We both really enjoyed each other, and we always had a connection,, since we met. She is a total opposite of in me in character, but we share the same mentality and life choices for the future. EL told me that she was always with someone since she around 15 years old, but it was always a bad/toxic relationship, and i could feel that sometimes, she was always ready to have her guard up or pull her self back, so it took a lot of time for her to open up to me, but she did, like i never seen anyone before, that made our connection even stronger, but after some time she told me that she lost feelings, (important) EL have mild Autism and ADHD so her brain does work a little different that anything i tried before. She tells me that i'm the greatest and the sweetest person she ever met, i learn her to finally feel how it is to be loved and cared for, and most import to me, to finally feel safe with another person, she told me that she never had these feelings before and she cares a lot about me. her diagnosis made all this a trouble but i took that with positive mind, even tho sometimes it was hard, she can only say things that she is feeling right now in the moment, so if i was gone for some time and i told her ""im going to miss you"" she will not tell that back as she is not missing me right now, same with I love you, we always told this to each other only in critical moment as her brain don't think that the other moment was worth saying ""i love you"". At the end of the relationship she told me that she is not in love me anymore, i asked to explain, and she told me that all the feelings and things are there and this is almost perfect, but she is feeling that, there is something missing, but she dosent know that. i had very good relation with her mother and the mother told me that it is just her brain work, she is always tring to find things. So when me and El talked i told that she should stop looking and trying to find ""love"" as love is not just a feeling but also a decision, and ofc after sometime the butterflies are going to fade. but she is already fixed on what she self had thought and want to break up, she is not ready in 100% to commit for a relationship right now, cuz she want to feel single/alone, she want to learn to love herself before she can love me. i of course understand that, but it breaks my heart, as i always tried to help her and show her real love, i ask if she want to be single to see other people but not, it is not about other people, but the future, that she always need to think about other person which is draining, and in normal situation i would just be gone with that words, but cuz of her diagnosis and trauma(both mental and sexual) i understand that, especially with ADHD where she just need to turn of from everything and be alone for some time.   
So we broke up after some time fighting for it, but it was to draining for her.   
**THE help:**  
Now i need help, she told me that is really wants to still be friends as we became best friends, and want to still talk to me, and send me msg's, and see movies with me and go on walks and for a coffee, she is just not feeling like kissing and all that love stuff. but i told her that i dont know if i can do that as my feelings are to strong and i will always try to be with her and flirt and so on. but she wants to. now it has been 4 days and i already feel drained, i try not to talk to her as i want to get back to my rutine with not having someone around and care for someone, it going really hard for me, she told me that she is feeling really alone and lonely now after we broke up. and i Dont know what to do, i really dont want to loose her, but at the same time i want to respect her and give her the space she is asking for, but i really breaks my heart to think that i can not talk or see her in the future or even msg her, we were always talking with eachother and told how our days went. but i dont know what is the move now, should i just no contact her and give her the space or should i talk and do things with her like she told me. when we last talked eye to eye she told me ""i just need to find myself that's why im not saying this is over for sure, maybe in the future when im ready and the universe pulls us back togther again... until we meet again"". but this is not a movie, this is a real life and i dont want to spend the rest of my life waiting and hoping like an idiot. and then she told me that she likes movie and she want to stav positive.   
With all her words im really irritated, because it sounds like the breaking up was a bad idea, i really dont know what to do. i just dont what to loose her from my life, but i cant ""wait"" forever or see her with someone else. what should i do, how long should this last, should i msg her, should i talk to her, should i do that or do that, i dont know anything. please someone help.",1,1737302631.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

That didn't work out. Since then I've been regretting turning her down. I'm not sure why. I was arrogant and thought she wasn't for me because we didn't have the same interests. But I admit we got intimate very quickly and it felt like we had known each other for a long time, or that we were born from the same star or whatever metaphor you want. Two sides of the same coin, is what we agreed it was. Not to mention the sexual chemistry.

She had a massive crush on me and I know I must've broken her heart. We texted on Instagram but since I rejected her she stopped following me and later removed me as a follower of hers. We're both at uni but won't be seeing each other as we share no courses.

I know how this sounds and my woman friend have told me it would be selfish to contact her. I can't say she's wrong but I can't stop thinking of her.

I've noticed that if I do cardio at least 2 times a week for about 40 minutes I have a clear mind and don't feel brain fog almost at all. After doing cardio for 4 months my sleep went from 8:30 hours to 7 hours and (according to my watch sleep tracker) deep sleep and REM sleep mainly happen in the first 3-4 hours of the night instead of being spread out like before. This results in me falling asleep at 8:45 pm and waking up at 3 am feeling pretty good but staying in bed until 5 (meditating usually).

I don't drink coffee, I do weight training 3 days a week with 2 sessions of cardio every morning after waking up. I eat 3 healthy meals a day and one with some sugar and ""unhealthy foods"" because I struggle to get more calories in me to keep my weight on.

The fear is if that I sleep less (even if I feel good) I am prone to brain diseases. I know that I am getting older (35 now) and will sleep less but tried to offset that by working out and reaching the point described above,

1i51ofb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i51ofb/the_deer_man/,The Deer Man,"Julie drummed her fingers against the steering wheel, her dark straight hair falling like a curtain around her face as she sighed at the endless stretch of highway. The three-hour drive from Burberry to her mom's house in Northwoods First Nations always felt longer when she was alone – and lately, being alone had become an all-too-familiar state.

Highway 13 stretched out for miles before merging onto Highway 6. She made a quick pit stop in Hollowsville, a quaint paper mill town, for a much-needed coffee and bathroom break, then continued. The rocky landscape between Hollowsville and her childhood home in the Northern Woods was always stunning in the fading twilight – her mother loved to call them the Wajiwiinsan (Little Mountains) in Ojibwe. Even with the trees bare, the scenery was a spectacular sight and a refreshing change from the city's smog and busy traffic.

Julie stopped at the small bridge connecting the mainland to the island, and idled patiently, waiting for the light to change. During the busy summer months, the bridge swung open every hour to accommodate an influx of large seasonal boats. But in November, just after sunset, it appeared deserted, as did the sleepy town of Little River that lay just beyond it. Her phone beeped in the seat next to her, a text message.

**Mom:** ""Watch out for deer on the road! Love you.""

Julie's thumbs moved deftly over the keypad: ""No worries. See you soon. Xo.""

Driving alone at night made her acutely aware of her solitude. The occasional flicker of wildlife eyes was the only break in the emptiness. Then, about a half mile ahead, she spotted something enormous standing in the middle of the road; a buck, the biggest she'd ever seen. The car slowed to a complete stop a safe distance away, and she peered over the dash, surveying him carefully. He was tall and magnificent. Antlers stretched majestically upward from his head, looking regal and poised like a picture frozen in time.

Julie nodded. ""Boozhoo, Waawashkesh,"" she said with a tone of respect. His gaze fixed somewhere beyond the glare at the windshield, a sight that sent an inexplicable shiver down Julie's spine. Then, suddenly, the buck sprang toward her; the sickening thud of his body collapsing against the hood was followed by the shattering of her windshield. Glass pieces peppered her skin as his antlers thrust through the broken glass, mere inches from her face. Lydia screamed in terror as she pushed back in the seat as far as she could. Her hand fumbled with the door; there was an awful grinding sound as it shimmied it open. The buck's convulsions caused the hood to groan under its weight. It stared blankly, eyes bloodied and bulging in a way that would haunt her forever.

Julie stumbled out onto the roadway and into a pair of oncoming headlights. A horn blared loudly, causing her heart to jump. She lunged out of the way as the other vehicle flew past and came to a screeching halt. She collapsed onto the cold pavement.

The last thing she saw was a blurry shape approaching, and a man's warbled voice spoke as she faded into unconsciousness, ""Miss? Miss? Are you alright? Help is on the way.""

\---

The rattle of a med cart and the murmur of voices outside her room jolted her out of a nightmare. When she opened her eyes, the images floated, impressed like a misty mirage before her. But instead of a deer, a young man about her age stood there unflinching against a vast, empty darkness with his arms folded across his chest. ""Lora,"" his voice echoed like a chant in a big room. The car rushed toward him. The brakes were failing; she couldn't stop the collision from happening.

""Miss Wabigwan?"" Nurse Lumley's voice broke through the haze. Julie blinked, and the dream dissipated like a fine mist. She struggled to sit up, wincing at the stiffness in her neck.  

""Your neck is giving you trouble, huh?""

Julie nodded. ""Yes, where am I?""

Still groggy, she looked around the room and realized it was a hospital room.

""We'll get you something for the pain in a minute. And you're at Little River Hospital. They brought you in late last night. The medics said you hit a *deer* on the road."" She said it in a way that implied that Julie was lucky to be alive.

The deer. Julie remembered it all now. The deer had charged at her. ""Yeah, he came at me."" Gingerly, she touched the cuts on her face, wincing.

Nurse Lumley offered a sympathetic smile. ""Well, you're safe now, dear, and don't you worry about those nasty cuts; they'll be gone in no time.""  

Julie's mother, Mary walked into the room, carrying two large coffees in a tray. ""Good, you're awake."" She set the tray on the bedside table and sat next to her.

Nurse Lumley finished fluffing and straightening the pillows. ""There, all nice and comfy now."" She straightened. ""The doctor's going to be in soon to see you. Click the button if you need anything in the meantime."" She pointed to the call button at Julie's side. Julie nodded, and the nurse departed.

Her mom opened the tabs on both coffees, letting the steam escape. Julie rested back against the pillows.

""So how are you feeling, Julie?"" her mother looked her over, concern etching lines across her face. As a young widow and single mother, her daughter's well-being was always her main priority. There had been many uphill struggles along the way. However, Julie had grown into a beautiful young woman only months away from her bachelor's degree in creative writing; Mary couldn't have been prouder.

Julie thought carefully for a moment, ""Well, to be honest, Mom, I feel like I've been run over by a tow truck."" They both chuckled. ""But now I really just want to get out of here and go home.""

""Well, just wait for the doc to come in and look you over first,"" Mary winked.

As if right on cue, Doctor Swanson strode into the room, wearing a standard white coat with a clipboard clutched in his hand.

""Hello,"" he said, sounding almost chipper, setting the clipboard on the counter beside him before leaning against it casually. ""So, how are we feeling this morning, Julie?"" She noticed his lacklustre blue eyes, a clear sign of sleepless hours. She knew that look all too well, having spent many sleepless nights focused on her studies, living on coffee and cigarettes just to get by. Still, she had to credit him for at least trying to sound upbeat.

""I could be better, but I think I'm okay.""

""Well. Good, let's take a look then."" He walked over and applied gentle pressure to Julie's neck and back. She tried to not wince at the tender parts. When finished, he stepped back and thoughtfully weighed in on the evidence before passing final judgment. ""You may have some neck stiffness for a little while, but pain meds should take care of that, and plenty of rest."" He cast a side glance at Julie's mother, undoubtedly knowing she'd see to that.

Nurse Lumley re-entered, holding a small pill cup and a glass of water. ""Sorry, doctor, but an officer is waiting outside to speak to Julie."" She placed the pills and water down, then turned on her heel to exit.

""Well, I guess that's my cue to leave. Take care, Julie, and if anything comes up, then just come back.""

Julie downed her meds and then nodded. ""I will.""

Officer Josh Miigizi came in after Dr. Swanson left. Julie's face lit up. ""Josh!"" she exclaimed

""Hey Julie, long time no see."" He smiled warmly, then turned and nodded at her mom, ""Mrs. Waabigwan.""  

""Aanii Josh, come on in."" She nodded back and smiled; it made her heart glad to see Julie smiling again. Then she got up and conveniently excused herself to find a washroom so they could talk. Julie patted a clear spot on her bed next to her. ""come, sit,"" she commanded.

They spent the next while discussing the details of the accident at length for the report. They then graciously moved on to lighter subjects, like what's been transpiring in their lives up to the present. Julie gave him a quick three-minute summary about her pursuing a Creative Writing degree in Burry, a three-hour commute away. Josh shared he had joined the police force right after high school and returned to the island after his father's passing. He'd inherited his dad's house and lived there ever since.

""Hey, how about I swing by with coffee tomorrow? We can catch up some more.""

Julie nodded, a hint of a smile on her lips. ""Sure, why not?"" They quickly exchanged cell numbers. Suddenly, Josh's police radio crackled at his side; he immediately answered it and then had to leave in a hurry.

Moments later, Mary reappeared, looking more refreshed. ""Well? Are you ready to go, daughter?""

""Absolutely!"" Julie carefully got up to get ready. The pills eased the discomfort but some stiffness remained.

\---

It was good to be back on the rez again; on the way home, they stopped at Mogey's Variety just past two o'clock corner for some groceries and snacks. The sky was a slate grey; its smooth surface stretched for miles without a break in the cloud surface. It gave the land and the leafless trees a shadowy, colourless feel. Julie wished she had brought her sketchbook and pencils along for the trip.

""You need anything else before we go home?"" Her mom interrupted her reverie as she fiddled with the music playlist, trying to get it to play again.

""We're in the dead zone, Mom; you'll have to wait a few secs for the sound to kick in again,"" Julie pointed upward, signifying there was no service.

Oh, yeah, that's right, you'd think I'd remember that by now,"" her mom said, relaxing back into her seat again. Sure enough, the music automatically resumed playing only moments later.

The house seemed quiet, as if it were asleep. Her uncle's dog, Benji, from next door, waited near the front steps, his tail wagging cheerfully.

""Awe, Benji,"" her mom's tone was soft-spoken.

Benji waited for the car to park before circling around to greet Julie. She patted him gently. He was old in years, but still a happy boy, nonetheless.

The door was left unlocked like it usually was during the day, and the familiar scent of cinnamon air freshener told her she was home. Her mom headed to her room to put her purse away, calling back over her shoulder, ""Oh, before I forget, Josh dropped off your bag last night; it's by the couch."" Julie sighed with immense relief; her laptop and favourite books were in that bag, including a couple of first editions.

It had been quiet that night, and yet she couldn't sleep; the images of the accident kept seeping back into her thoughts. She remembered the name ""Lora"" and wondered what it all meant. She flipped over to her other side, facing the bookshelf, and spotted the pack of smokes she had left stashed on the second shelf a month ago. It rested on her copy of 'Bear Walker,' she slid one out.

Even though it had been a month since she quit, she couldn't resist the urge to have just one, especially now after the deer and car accident. And then the haunting nightmare, to boot. The whole thing was just too eerie for words. The first drag was the best; it made her feel grounded and connected to the present moment, as did the cold night. She thought about what Josh had said at the hospital. Maybe he was right; perhaps the car lights spooked the deer into panic, and it lost all direction. It really was the only reasonable explanation, the only one that made any sense, anyway. Her phone bleeped in her pocket. It suddenly occurred that she hadn't checked her messages since yesterday. Josh's name appeared on the screen: Hey, hope you all settled in. How about I drop by with coffee around 1ish tomorrow?

**Julie**: Sure! I take mine, black. :)

**Josh:** Okay, see ya then. ;)

SNAP. Julie jumped with a start, nearly dropping her phone. Her eyes immediately scanned the darkness for whatever it was. The hairs on her neck prickled up; she had the uncanny sensation of being watched. Her cigarette had burnt down to the nub, singing her fingers. She shook her hand and winced, then hurried back into the house, locking the doors behind her.

A tall figure stood out from the shadows, unaffected by the cold. Watching the house, his attention immediately drawn to the window where a single light was lit in one room; a woman's slender silhouette grazed by the curtains, and then the light went out.

\---

The savoury scent of bacon sizzling and freshly brewed coffee pulled Julie from sleep. Again, she'd been dreaming of 'him' - the attractive man with dark hair and deep-set eyes, only this time he motioned for her to follow him into dense woods. In the peaceful scene behind him, colourful birds took flight, and a young fawn, its large brown eyes sparkling with innocence, darted amongst the sun-dappled trees. The dream felt so real; she reached out with a pang of yearning to follow him into those woods. Yet, like water between her fingers, the dream slipped away, leaving only the ache of wanting.

During breakfast, her mom spoke enthusiastically about a gathering she was heading to this morning with the aunties, and she invited Julie to tag along with them. She declined her mom's offer, explaining that she had already made plans to spend the day with Josh. Mary playfully nudged her daughter, insinuating that they might wind up becoming a thing. Julie laughed. Though Josh was good-looking, the idea of dating right now seemed ludicrous. Since the beginning of her studies, there was little time for much else. Period.

That afternoon, Josh and Julie took a leisurely stroll through the woods behind the house with coffees in hand. The sun glared in the clear November sky, casting a cool haze over everything. ""So, how are ya today? Still hurtin?""

Instinctively, Julie touched her neck. ""Well, the pills help a bit; it's not that bad now,"" she replied.

""Good."" He kicked a stone out of the path and kept walking.

She continued, ""I haven't slept too well the past couple of days, though.""

""Really? Why's that?"" He glanced at her briefly, then took a sip of coffee; steam rose, mingling with his breath.

""It's nothing major, really."" She shrugged, then took a swig from her own cup; three-quarters of the way done, she could feel the effects of the caffeine already kicking in, giving her a slight energy boost..

""Come on, just lay it out."" He nudged her encouragingly.

They stopped at a large fallen tree and sat down in the middle. That's when Julie opened up about her dreams and the mysterious deerman. When she finished, she downed the rest of her coffee and gazed thoughtfully out at the trees. Waiting for his response.

Finally, after a moment or two, he spoke. ""This man you're dreaming about reminds me of a story my grandpa Joe told me a few years back when we were out at his camp.""

Julie's interest suddenly piqued. ""Oh yeah? I don't think I've heard it. How does it go?""

He shivered in his jacket. ""Well, how about we head back, and I'll tell you on the way?""

She nodded, ""Deal.""

Waashkesh Nini

On a fall day back in the 70s, a chilling presence settled over the reserve. Word started spreading throughout the community: reports of an unusually large deer, unlike anything seen before. The first sighting happened in the woods just behind the apartment complex at the southern end of the community.

Hoofprints left behind, undeniably from an animal, like a deer or an elk, but much larger than that. The elders talked in quiet voices; their weathered faces etched with concern. A spirit animal, a visitor from the unknown.

Some villagers believed the deer was a kind of protector, while others viewed it as evidence of sorcery at play or a shapeshifter. Suspicion rippled through the tranquil reserve of what or who it could be.

One quiet evening, a young native woman named Lora stood outside her home wrapped in a wool blanket, as she so often did, to gaze up at the stars. Lately, a kind of loneliness had settled over her life.

At twenty-two, she lived alone in a house inherited from her late grandmother. Being adopted at the young age of three, she had no memories of her real birth family, and her shyness always made it difficult to get to know people. More than anything, she craved companionship and romance. Lora often wished for a handsome, tall man to come into her life and sweep her off her feet.

The following Saturday, after the sun sank over the horizon, Lora sat on the deck again with a cup of steeped tea, this time gazing at the distant glow of the local dancehall. She imagined people dancing there and having fun under the glowing lights and wondered what it must be like.

""If only someone would ask me to the dance,"" she whispered to the evening breeze, ignoring her late grandmother's wise counsel to always be careful what she wished for. Instead, whether or not she realized it, Lora sent her intent out into the void of all things. Her invitation beckoned to a place deep in the woods where the oldest things still lived. A shooting star trailed across the sky like a silver ribbon, and she felt a warm energy begin in the pit of her stomach. A familiar yearning emerged.

That evening, as she lay in bed staring at the tiled ceiling, images of couples dancing filled her mind. ""…handsome man,"" she murmured before drifting into a restless sleep. The stillness of the night thickened with anticipation. An intrusive rapping on her door echoed through her dreams like thunder. Lora jerked awake. It was strange for anyone to visit this late, but out of curiosity, she pulled on her shawl, cautiously approached the door, and turned on a light.

As the door swung open, she gasped in surprise. Before her stood, undoubtedly, the most attractive man she'd ever laid eyes on, his skin a warm tan, his eyes gleaming like polished obsidian. An air of mystery surrounded him.

""Hey, I'm Devin,"" he said, a charming smirk playing on his lips. ""I know it's *really* late, but I'm trying to get to a dance hall. Could I bother you for directions?"" A crop of dark hair fell over his eyes as though it were deliberate, catching. The fading light.

Lora swooned slightly and wondered if this was all a dream. A handsome man shows up at her door late at night, asking for directions. A feeling of doubt niggled at the pit of her stomach.

She suddenly remembered stories her grandmother told of mysterious, handsome young men in black who were not really men at all, who would seduce women and take them, never to be seen again.   

""Uh, look, I'm not up for going anywhere tonight. ,""Sorry, I can't help you,"" Lora replied hesitantly and started closing the door. His gaze locked onto hers with a magnetic pull. He stepped closer, and a mysterious air of energy hung around him. ""You should come to the dance with me. It'll be fun. Just forget everything else."" In that instant, the energy shifted, enveloping her in a heady aura of intoxicating and alluring magnetism. He was… irresistible. Lora felt her resolve melting away. ""Okay… I'll go,"" she said, despite the smallest protest in the back of her mind. I'll get ready.

As they climbed into his shiny, black pickup truck and drove off, her mind was floating lost somewhere in a white fog on the outer fringes of her consciousness, but she could still sense and feel things: the truck jolting along the dirt road, the smell of the vehicle's interior, and the warmth of a man's rough worn hand intermingled in hers. A single memory fragment floated past, and her mind latched on, holding fast. And then she remembered something. Devin. It's Devin, and then it all faded to black.

\---

As they arrived at the dance hall, her earlier memories had all but faded and been replaced by new ones: Devin knocked on the door, asking for directions. They hit it off, and then he graciously invited her to the dance, and she happily accepted.

The thrum of music pulsed from the speakers; under the warm lantern glow, the dance floor was alive with people adorned in cowboy hats and boots, moving and swaying with the music. Lora felt an overwhelming thrill in Devin's presence. Tonight, she felt like the prettiest woman in the room. As they moved across the dancefloor, all eyes drew to them. Women watched with envious sighs while men regarded Lora with looks of admiration.

Yet unease flickered to life within her as the night went on. She noticed Devin's eyes had changed–more comprehensively, with a new glint of darkness lurking in their depths. The atmosphere in the room shifted, but Lora tried to brush it all off as a side effect of the music. Still, an inexplicable tension now hung in the air; it was tangible enough that even the other dancers sensed something was off kilter.

As the music died, their dancing slowed to a stop. Devin leaned in close and whispered in her ear, ""Midnight's almost here. Time for us to go."" She broke free from his embrace and stepped back, confused. ""What do you mean? She turned and glanced at the clock, both hands now pointed to Midnight.

""Oh, oh. Too late!"" His tone dripped with amusement as he took a few steps back.

The crowd had now cleared a circle around them. In that instant, Devin's body contorted and shifted where a man once stood; a hideous creature now emerged. Antlers spawned grotesquely from his head, casting eerie shadows across the dance hall. His feet twisted into hooves and clattered noisily against the wooden floor as he took two steps towards Lora. Fear descended, replacing the buoyant atmosphere and sending ripples of horror through the crowd. Lora stumbled back in terror and awe.

The crowd erupted in utter panic. The frantic rush to get away turned the space into a scene of chaos. People stumbled into one another, sending fall harvest decorations and balloons twirling and swaying wildly in their mad rush to escape. Lora remained frozen, torn between fear and the haunting sense of connection she felt with this strange creature that now stood before her.

Devin looked around pleasantly, pleased, his arms raised to address an empty room. ""Ah, good. Now that we're alone. We can talk.""

""Wha… what?"" she asked, her voice croaking shakily. Then she cleared it and tried again to sound steadier this time."" What is it you want?""

""You've experienced the night's enchantment, but now I want something in return.""

Panic rose in Lora as the weight of his words settled in. She dared to ask,

""What is it?""

""You."" He mused. ""I have travelled far and wide to find a woman like you who will balance me. Someone worthy,"" he said. ""Come with me now. You will never be alone again.""

A wave of dread washed over her at the thought of being tied to Devin, a sorcerer and shapeshifter. Trembling, she stepped back and shouted, ""No!"" struggling to stay calm. ""I won't go with you!""

Devin's expression shifted from amusement to fury as the lights flickered. A hearty laugh reverberated off the walls of the dance hall.

""You dare refuse me, Lora? You'll face the consequences.""

 

""No one will love you, Lora. You'll always be alone, just like you always have been.""

 

Summoning all her courage, Lora declared, ""If I'm going to love someone, then it should be of my own choosing, not anyone's or any *thing* else'*s*.""

She turned on her heel and pushed through the hall doors, running out into the night. It no longer held any of its magic for her. Looming shadows seemed to stretch and stretch, morphing into eerie shapes. She could hear strange noises, rustling in the trees, and the familiar sound of hooves crunching on gravel from behind her, getting closer. Frightened, she ran on, never daring to look back.

Suddenly, to her great relief, a set of blurry car lights came into view half a mile down the road. Lora waved her hands frantically in the air until the vehicle slowed to a stop. Sweating and breathless, she stumbled over to the passenger side, glanced over her shoulder, and got in. As the car turned around, her eyes briefly scanned the road in the headlights, but thankfully, there was no sign of the creature anywhere.

 

After arriving home, she thanked the driver and got out. A wave of relief washed over her as she walked down the driveway. The familiar sight of the house, filled with precious memories of her grandmother, was a great comfort. Standing beneath the moon's glow, Lora realized, at that moment, that love wasn't merely something to wish for but a journey of self-discovery that she'd have to undertake to truly understand.

She began her first week of school at a nearby college a month later. The first bell buzzed as she slammed her locker shut. She rushed down the hall late for her first class, incidentally, colliding with another student exiting a room from the right. Books flew off in all directions.

""Oh, my god. I'm so sorry, ""a young man, Lora's age, glanced down apologetically. Without looking, she quickly bent to retrieve the textbooks.

The young man squatted beside her, grabbed one, and handed it back. ""Uh, here you go,"" he said nervously.

She looked down at the hand holding the book and raised her eyes to meet his. She noted their colour, sea green---her favourite color.

""Thanks,"" she replied shyly and took it.

""Um, I'm Stephen,"" he extended his right hand.

""Lora,"" she smiled.  

 

 

""The End.""

""Wow,"" Julie exclaimed. Clapping. ""That is an amazing story!""

Josh grinned, ""yeah, Gramps always was a skilled storyteller.""

Julie nodded thoughtfully. ""The story… it's not real, though, is it?""

According to Gramps, it happened back in the 70s; the girl Lora supposedly died in a car accident two years after it happened; it was long before we were born. In fact, you are living two houses away from where she did, Josh said matter-of-factly. He stopped and turned to face her; his expression was quizzical. ""You really never knew?""

Julie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. ""Uh, no,"" she replied, her voice inflecting slightly, ""I had no idea. And the name Lora. That's the name I heard in my dream.""

""Yeah, I know,"" Josh said and grew silent. They continued walking, each lost in their own quiet reflection.

Josh stopped dead in his tracks twenty meters from the woods' edge. His eyes riveted to the ground; with a murmured exclamation, he sank into a crouch.

""Why did you stop?"" Julie asked, coming to stand beside him. Josh hadn't replied, his attention focused on the ground. She traced his gaze to where he'd cleared away some leaves, revealing large hoofprints.

""Oh, my goodness."" Julie followed his lead and hunkered down to study the outline of the prints more closely. She splayed her hand over it; it was almost a perfect fit. Slowly, their eyes met, then turned to look at the house. Together, they brushed some more twigs and dried leaves out of the way, searching for more evidence of prints, but found none.

""How can that be?"" Josh asked, dumbfounded. They both exchanged bewildered glances.

Julie shook her head. ""That's so weird.""

""Julie, "" her mother called out to her, carrying an arm full of groceries in from the car. They both rose to their feet and walked back in silence.

Later that evening, **Josh texted:** Hey, my grandfather is back home from out west. You should come out for a visit. He brought back some homemade elk jerky! ;)

Julie knew that Josh's grandpa was a respected elder in the community.

It had been a long time since she'd sat with an elder. Amidst the growing peculiarities in her life lately, now was probably a good time as any to seek wisdom again.

**She texted back:** Okay, I'll be there soon.

With a trade blanket and some tobacco, Julie snuck out quietly and set off down the highway in her mother's car to Josh's grandfather's place on Mukwa Road. Just past Miigwan's craft shop, the darkness suddenly thickened with unexpected fog. It seemed surreal to see fog in mid-November, but climate change was worsening. Julie slowed her speed, moving cautiously through the formless shapes in the mist. Until one shape appeared to become more solid and took the familiar form of a man. He stood off to the side of the road and waved his hand to get her attention. Despite her initial wariness, she pulled over and rolled down the passenger window. He seemed non-threatening and claimed to be headed in the same direction. Acting against her better judgment, perhaps because of sympathy, she offered him a lift.  

Julie dared a quick glance at him, her eyes refocused back on the road. There was something vaguely familiar about the guy, though she was sure she'd never seen him before. He looked young, about her age. Even with his mussed hair partially swept over his eyes, she could tell he was a handsome Nish, mysterious, and kind of sexy; her mind wandered, entertaining thoughts she hadn't had since school began. ""So, uh, what's your name?"" she asked, trying to keep her mind from lingering in places it probably shouldn't be.

His voice then dropped to a mumble; words indistinguishable as his hands moved as though they were signing in a type of unknown language. A wave of dizziness swept over Julie, and her skin became flushed.

They came to a fork in the road. ""Turn left here,"" he gestured toward a deserted dirt road opposite her turnoff. Though it was out of her way, she did as she was told, an inexplicable pull guiding her hands on the wheel.

""Stop here,"" he commanded. Julie pulled off to the side of the deserted road. It was pitch black out, and no other vehicles were in sight. Unable to move, Julie could only wait for whatever dark fate awaited her. From her peripheral vision, the man beside her appeared to be nothing more than a blurry shape in dark clothing, his face obscured by the shadows.

In the eerie silence that hung there between them, her phone rang, the high, shrill buzz temporarily breaking the spell of enchantment. She seized the moment to escape and flung open the car door and ran for the trees, her feet splashing through a partially frozen puddle. The cold water prickled at her damp feet, but she didn't care.

""Lora,"" He called out behind her. You can run but won't get away from me this time.""

Thin branches whipped at her face, stinging the newly healed cuts on her cheeks as she rushed further into the trees; the frozen earth crunched beneath her feet. Darkness engulfed her. She tripped on a loose deadwood in the path and fell to the ground with a thud. The earth felt cold and rough beneath her. Quickly, she struggled to her feet, leaning against an old oak for support. Its cold, twisted bark pressed to her back as she struggled to ascertain her thoughts. Why did he call her Lora? Was there any truth to this? Doubt crept into her thoughts. Or was this all an illusion? A cruel sorcerer's trick.

""Lora, there's no use hiding."" He called out.

With each step into the woods, the man's body shifts and contorts. His limbs lengthen, his torso narrowing as he takes on the tall, muscled form of a deerman. His transformation into a half-man, half-deer creature is a blend of flesh and wilderness magic. Branches cracked beneath the weight of his hooves as he came to stand in an open space 15 meters away from where Julie hid. Steam snorted through his nostrils as he turned his head, sniffed the air, and continued disappearing into the foliage.

She clung to the tree, desperate to keep from sight. Her heart pounded furiously, threatening to burst from her chest.

Three miles down the road, in a rustic log cabin beneath a tin roof, an elderly man sat before an open altar of sacred items; he picked up the turtle shell rattle handed down through generations and grasped it in his weathered hand. The rattle shakes, and he chants in a low, raspy voice, singing from his heart centre, imploring the ancestors to help shield Julie. The potent medicine from the rattle swirls about the cabin and goes forth into the night. In the meantime, Josh had already bolted from the cabin in search of Julie, racing against time to find her before it was too late.

Julie trembled behind the tree; the cold pricked at her toes like sewing needles and stung her blood-stained cheeks, but she dared not move a muscle until it was gone. After a few moments of unsettling silence, she mustered up enough courage to peer out, her eyes strained to see into the trees. When there was no sign of the creature, she made her way out into the open, cautiously looking around so more for fear that it might come back.

Josh peered over the dash in the headlights, looking for any sign of Julie. He spotted a car ahead parked off the roadside, the driver's door ajar. He immediately got out and grabbed his rifle and a flashlight, then ran after the footprints leading into the forest.

Twigs snapped and rustled behind Julie. Her heart leaped as she realized she wasn't alone. Slowly turning, her gaze met two glowing yellow eyes, like separate entities, hovering five feet above her. For the first time, she witnessed the thing chasing her. It was a partial man's body with the head of a deer, complete with gnarled antlers that twisted upward, grotesque and misshapen. His arms were sparsely covered in deer fur and had become more elongated. Looking down, she saw Hooven feet. Julie then screamed in sheer terror at the monstrous being that stood before her in all its horrifying glory. She thoroughly believed that the devil had come to steal her soul.

Joe sang with even greater intensity, his eyes still closed. He shook the rattle vigorously, its high-energy vibrations piercing the ether. Powerful chanting carried through the night to encircle the creature. The spiritual assault had begun; it stumbled back, shaking its enormous head in blind confusion and fury; antlers broke the nearby branches. Josh broke into the clearing, calling Julie in earnest. He spotted her a few feet away from the beast and raised his shotgun, firing a single shot at the creature, grazing its arm. The sound echoed through the night; the monster stumbled back, shrieking in pain. Josh ran to Julie. Dropping the shotgun, he grabbed her in his arms, shielding her.

The aura around the creature shivered and vibrated with preternatural intensity; suddenly, it let out a chilling scream–a horrifying cross between a man's cry and a deer's wail. Julie and Josh clamped their hands over their ears, recoiling from the sound. Then, in frantic desperation, accepting defeat, it bolted, crashing through the underbrush with mad abandon. The Deerman tore through the woods, driven by a primal urge to escape.

Julie collapsed in Josh's arms, and he held her close, rubbing her back with reassurance, ""it's over now, Julie, he said reassuringly, ""It's over.""

""Not this time, Waawasshkesh Nini, not this time,"" Grandpa Joe spoke, seeing that Julie and Josh were together and safe; he lowered his rattle, his face shining from perspiration. He nodded. It is done.

Because I’m new to all this I’m not sure what to expect, but the coffee seems… watery? I bought a mixed selection of flavours on Amazon (Two Rivers). I tried the Hazelnut 8oz; watery. Tried the Oh Fudge 8oz on the strong setting and it was both watery and didn’t have much taste.

Is this normal? I usually add milk, is that a mistake? This cup brand has good reviews….

The only times I have coffee it’s either a mocha from a local coffee place or Nescafé espresso instant coffee; I’m definitely not a coffee snob but I’m also not drinking it for the caffeine hit but for the taste.

I (27f) was dating this guy (24m) from work for a couple of months. Everything was going amazingly and he seems like an incredible, genuine guy. He put in effort, zero red flags, taking it slow, etc. He planned dates and talked to me consistently. He did lots of little things for me like grabbing me a coffee on his break, walking me to my car etc. We did everything a couple did except have sex, we didn’t do that yet and he wasn’t pressuring me. We held hands and would kiss, and there was zero indication he didn’t want a serious relationship with me, he made it so abundantly clear how much he really liked me. He has said he wasn’t talking to anyone else even though we weren’t officially bf and gf yet, and the way he acted towards me and the effort he put in made me believe that. He has a 2 year old son, and I’m the first serious person he’s pursued since leaving his baby mama. 

Also, we started off as friends for the first month and talked and hung out a lot. I could tell he liked me but I was nervous at first about going for it since I felt insecure about my past relationships and wanted to be as “perfect” as I could be before dating again. He talked to me about it and said that’s something you could work on with your partner, I thought about it a lot and decided I would date him because I ended up liking him a lot. Everything was going perfectly. 

So tell me why he starts acting different the past few days and last night he calls me and says he realized he just isn’t ready and feels emotionally unavailable because of him having a kid? He realized he just doesn’t know how to navigate a relationship right now with his kid. But I’m trying to understand why he isn’t taking his own advice he gave me and why he wouldn’t want to be with me if he was serious about me, which again I had no indication that he wasn’t. Zero fuck boy or narc vibes whatsoever. Our communication was amazing. He said he couldn’t deal with how he would “treat me” (referring to messing up sometimes like passing out when we had plans or canceling plans sometimes due to his kid” but I made it clear how understanding I was that he is a single father and that I am not the priority. None of it bothered me. I couldn’t stop texting him afterwards about how hurt and misled I feel, and that I feel like he’s lying and that there’s someone else.. he apologized again and said he understands and that he really did not mean to hurt me. He kept reassuring over the phone that it’s nothing about me and that it isn’t someone else or unresolved feelings for his ex, etc. He also mentioned something about realizing he’s not yet fully processed/dealt with the fact that his son won’t have his two parents together, but that doesn’t mean he wants to be with her (he broke up with her 7-9 months ago). He said it would be hard for me to understand without having a child of my own. He said he didn’t know this when he first tried with me  and that none of his feelings were a lie but I’m having a hard time understanding.

Please help me understand, this feels so out of left field and I’m devastated. I really thought this man was super into me. He is the one that came up to me and he asked my coworkers about me before he did. He just took me out in a date 3 days ago and called me just to talk in the morning and talked about doing other things in the near future .. like I said the effort he was putting in and how happy he was every time we saw each other at work or went on dates gave me no reason to believe he didn’t like me enough.

1i51l57,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i51l57,16-Bit Racing Legends: Top 5 Sega Genesis Games,"Today, I want to talk about racing games that were hugely popular on the only 16-bit console available in my hometown—the Sega Genesis. While I wouldn’t call myself a fan of racing games, they were impossible to avoid. As someone who traded and later sold games for consoles and PCs, I had a clear view of what was trending, even if I didn’t personally enjoy the genre. Today, I’m excited to share that knowledge with you. So, here are the top five racing games in my town back in the day!


---

5th Place – Virtua Racing

This game was the first on the Sega Genesis to feature full 3D graphics, thanks to a special chip (the Virtua Processor) built into the cartridge. However, this tech innovation came at a steep cost, making the cartridge significantly more expensive. Ironically, despite its groundbreaking visuals, the game wasn’t very well-received elsewhere, which led to a surplus of these cartridges being sold at a discount in my country.

For me, seeing a full 3D racing game on the Genesis was mind-blowing. I went to great lengths to get a copy and would often bring it to friends’ houses, as my own TV was a tiny black-and-white set. Watching my friends' jaws drop as they saw a 3D racing sim for the first time was priceless.

While the game’s technical achievements are fascinating even today, its gameplay left much to be desired. Many people quickly traded it back to me, allowing me to capitalize on its limited replay value.


---

4th Place – Top Gear 2

Before writing this post, I revisited all the games to refresh my memory, and I still don’t fully understand why Top Gear 2 was so wildly popular in my town. If this were a personal list, I’d have given this spot to Chase HQ II, a game I genuinely enjoyed for its thrilling car chases. But Top Gear 2 was an obsession for my peers, likely because of its extensive track list and car upgrades.

While I’ve never had any desire to drive a car myself (even at 40, I avoid it!), this game struck a chord with everyone around me. Its popularity made it a valuable item for trading, which I was more than happy to take advantage of to get my hands on other games I enjoyed.


---

3rd & 2nd Place – Road Rash 2 & Road Rash 3

The Road Rash series by EA revolutionized racing games for my generation. These weren’t just racing sims—they were an escape, offering a sense of freedom we didn’t have in real life. Growing up in a restrictive environment where motorcycles were banned, these games let us live out our biker fantasies.

The mix of racing, combat (with chains and clubs!), and an unforgettable soundtrack made Road Rash a cultural phenomenon. Even now, I recommend these games to anyone who hasn’t tried them. They’re a timeless blend of adrenaline, chaos, and fun.


---

1st Place – Rock n’ Roll Racing

At first, I didn’t understand why this game was so popular. It was always available, yet everyone wanted it. I traded and sold this cartridge dozens of times before finally sitting down to play it myself—and I was hooked.

With a killer rock soundtrack featuring licensed hits, extensive vehicle upgrades, and addictive multiplayer gameplay, Rock n’ Roll Racing was in a league of its own. It’s a game I still hope to see revived for modern audiences. If you haven’t played it yet, trust me—you’re in for a treat.

Last night I learned about a plant called Ephedra viridis, it is a California native shrub commonly known as Mormon tea plant or brigham tea plant. Ephedra viridis is the plant that the supplement Ephedra is extracted from. It is currently illegal (in USA)  to sell supplements containing Ephedra extract… however you can still sell it as a tea, as these are not regulated by the fda. It is referred to as Mormon tea because it acts as a stimulant and Mormons are not allowed to drink tea or coffee as part of their religion. It is also affects histamine. So I started wondering about ephedra as a treatment for narcolepsy… It turns out that it was used as an effective treatment for narcolepsy in the past. So my question is, have any of you used the tea with success? And have any of you used the tea while medicated with stimulants and sodium oxybates? There is no listed drug interactions except avoiding use with stimulants but that is also said for caffeine and ginseng. I understand why supplements with ephedra were band by the fda. Such a high concentration sold over the counter as weightloss drugs is reckless. I myself bought it as a teen… I am truly curious about it used in smaller doses brewed with other beneficial herbs as a tea. My research on this has been brief so please go easy on me lol.

I’ve been on Omeprazole 10MG - 20MG for 15 years. I was finally tired of having to take a pill to live and wanted to try and fix this. Important to note that I worked with my GI doctor as I went through this process. I have a hiatal hernia that exacerbates my symptoms. I Like many of you my symptoms are tight chest, constant burping, “sour” stomach, waking up in the middle of the night choking on acid that sometimes leads to vomiting, irritated throat, hoarseness etc. So how did I beat it? First, my eight is where it should be. If you’re overweight you have to start there, no exceptions. Sorry! From there, I eliminated coffee, chocolate, alcohol. I don’t smoke but if you do you’re not fixing this until you stop. Again, sorry! Next I made sure my portions are small and absolutely no eating after 6:30. I go to bed at 10:00. I make sure to drink Kefir daily. I saw somebody post this awhile back and it’s been a game changer for me. I also started taking Allegra daily. We believe the antihistamine has had a positive  effect at reducing my symptoms. I also eat a low fat diet that is high in fiber. I try to follow a Mediterranean diet and that has been extremely helpful. After a month of following g these guidelines I slowly came off Omeprazole. I took 10 MG for two straight days and then took the third day off. I did this for two weeks. I then went every other day for a month. Then, one pull every three days for a month. I was able to stop completely. During this transition, I took Gaviscon after each meal on the days I did not take meds. At night I took a tablespoon of Reflux Gourmet before bed. The hiatal hernia will always be an issue and I have to be mindful of this but I feel so much better! I was able to avoid the rebound acid attacks with this regimen. I have also noticed my anxiety is at a low. I believe PPIs were contributing to this too. Not going to lie, this has been hard and involved making some very hard lifestyle changes but it has been worth it. Everybody’s body is different and you need to consult with your doctor but you can beat this!!

Start date: December 18, 2024
Height: 5'4
Age: 32

Hi everyone! I'd like to give a rundown on each medication, lifestyle changes and tips since starting Kit 1. I'm so suprised by the success I've had so far. I'm  too shy to do a progress pic so maybe next time. I'm on mobile so forgive me for the format. 

MEDICATIONS 
Bupropion XL: I haven't noticed any side effects taking it. I have noticed my mood as increased significantly to a less depressed baseline and less cravings for food and nicotine (I vape.) I am less irritable.

Naltrexone: This is so nasty and chalky to take!! Best to chug a flavor drink with it, like your morning coffee or tea. And at night i like cold green tea or crystal light flavor water.

Metformin: first few days I did not have an appetite when taking it and big mistake. I woke up at 3am with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I take it at night and the directions say take with a meal. I really don't have an appetite but now I'll take this medicine with Ensure, yogurt or smoothie if I can't eat a full meal.

Medicine overall: I feel shaky or jittery sometimes. I sometimes feel a little foggy or ""disconnected."" I had the diarrhea issue when first starting metformin. My mood has significantly increased for the better thanks in part to the bupropion. I've had issues with constipation. I haven't had any issue with hair fall out like others mentioned. 

FOOD AND LIFESTYLE

Exercising: I haven't really stated a workout regiment, my job in Healthcare can be a bit physical with running around. I do some yoga. I'm waiting for spring to walk again, that is my favorite way to exercise. 

Food: my binging had drastically decreased along with cravings. I started the Kit before the holidays and noticed I didn't binge at Christmas.  I've only ordered take out 3x in the last 30 days where I used to order out 2-3x a week. When I ordered out, I ordered twice at Mediterranean restaurants with leftover and once at McDonald's (small fry, 6 piece nugget with no sauce and medium coke.) I used to order multiple meals and just go to town on them and now I have leftover with almost everything I eat due to feeling full. My ""diet"" is is my favorite fruits and veggies, Mediterranean/middle eastern dishes, chicken, rice, salads, sandwiches  soups, smoothies, yogurt, cheese. I HAVE NO PASSION FOR COOKING. I try not to limit myself just make better choices..like still enjoying a donut for breakfast with coworkers instead of sneaking for another one or two.

Drinks: I only had ONE soda/pop/soft drink in the last 30 days with my McDonald's order and I was so hyper after lol. I've only drink water, coffee,  cold green tea and crystal light when I take that nasty naltrexone. My water intake has increased since starting this Kit. I don't drink alcohol so it's not a problem for me.

NON SCALE VICTORIES:

•Less bloating and my clothes are fitting better, less muffin top and spillage out of bra.
•my skin has cleared up from break outs both body and face.
•some stretch marks have faded 
•my facial features are sharper.
•I have more energy, less irritability and depression.

Tips/things that help me:

•Start a probiotic to help you poop lol constipation can be an issue. And see what multivitamin is best for you.
•keep a calendar and reminders when to start medicine when you're first starting out. It looks so intimidating with all the increasing but keeping track really helped me. I have a paper calendar and phone one for reminders. After week 5 it should be smooth sailing with maintenance. 
•hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. They give you a water bottle for a reason.
• get some Ensure or other nutritional shake to get some calories in if you can bare to eat with no appetite. 
• I do not weight myself every single day. I realize now with a healthy mindset that weight can fluctuate daily and it was demoralizing for me in the past. I'd rather have schedule days of checking my weight.

In the past months, I conducted multiple experiments with programmatic SEO and would like to share some tips here. By the end of this guide, I hope you’ll learn how *not* to go about programmatic SEO, so your website doesn’t get into Google’s spam filters — as happened to one of my experiments. This guide will cover:

2. Keyword research and tools
3. Why is buying a good domain name important?
4. Backlink building and why it is important
5. Future of programmatic SEO

# 1. How to Come Up with an Idea?

Every successful programmatic SEO project starts with a solid idea. But how do you come up with one? Start by identifying a niche or industry you’re passionate about or familiar with. Your understanding of the niche can provide a competitive edge.

If you can’t come up with an idea easily, it means you need to do some research. There are tons of ways to generate ideas, and I’ll list a few effective methods here.

**Find Datasets with Poor UI and Transform Them into Great Websites**

One of the best platforms for discovering datasets is **Kaggle**, which hosts thousands of searchable datasets. As of now, Kaggle lists more than 400,000 datasets.

***Pro Tip:*** *Transforming datasets with subpar interfaces into user-friendly and visually appealing websites can be a winning strategy.*

**Leverage Your Own Datasets to Gain a Competitive Advantage**

If you run an existing business or side hustle, chances are you already have access to data that no one else has.

For example, consider the **JobTest** website. Users complete a quiz and receive career recommendations based on their answers to multiple-choice questions. This unique data could easily be utilized to create programmatic SEO pages, giving you a significant edge over competitors.

JobTest could easily use their quiz data to create **skill-based pages** that highlight careers suited to specific skills identified in the quiz, such as problem-solving or creativity. For instance, pages like */careers-for-problem-solvers* or */careers-for-creative-thinkers* could summarize job opportunities for individuals with these strengths. These pages could rank for searches like “Careers for creative people” or “Jobs for problem solvers.”

**Scrape publicly available data and transform it with existing AI tools**

If you don’t have proprietary data, another great option is to scrape publicly available data. The key is not just scraping but transforming this raw data into something unique, insightful, and user-friendly. For example:

• Scrape real estate listings and create a hyper-localized property directory.

• Collect restaurant menu data to build a comprehensive food discovery platform.

• Use AI tools like GPT-based models or Stable Diffusion for creative enhancements such as summarizing reviews, generating captions, or even creating visuals.

**Start Backward: Understand Monetization First**

Before finalizing your idea, it’s crucial to think about **how you’ll monetize your website**. This should be a significant factor in your decision-making process. A brilliant idea without a clear path to revenue can lead to wasted effort and frustration.

• Will you monetize through **ads**, **affiliate marketing**, or **direct sales**?

• Does the niche have products, services, or opportunities with sufficient earning potential?

• Are there high-value keywords or industries you can target for premium ad placements?

 ***The key takeaway.*** *A successful programmatic SEO idea solves a real user problem while leveraging unique or underutilized data to create value — and has a clear path to monetization. Once you have your idea, you’re ready to move on to the next step —* ***keyword research***\*!\*

# 2. Keyword Research and Tools

Everyone knows tools like **Ahrefs**, **SEMRush**, and similar SEO platforms. We also know they can be expensive as hell! If you can afford them, great — but there are effective, **free alternatives** to get you started.

A combination of **Google Ads Keyword Planner**, **Google Trends**, and (if possible) a short-term subscription to Ahrefs can work wonders for your keyword research workflow. Even if you subscribe to Ahrefs for just one month, it should provide enough value to kickstart your process. Let me break down how to use these tools together for maximum efficiency.

**Start with Google Ads Keyword Planner: Finding Keyword Opportunities**

Google Ads Keyword Planner is fantastic for discovering high-volume, low-competition keywords. Here’s how to use it effectively:

• **Search for Seed Keywords**: Start with a broad keyword related to your niche. For example, if you’re building a **directory for board games**, you might begin with **“board games”** as your seed keyword. From there, explore related categories like **Popular board games (**“best board games 2025”, “top-rated board games.”, etc)

• **Analyze Metrics**: Look at the **search volume** and **competition**. Prioritize keywords with:

* Moderate to high search volume (e.g., >= 1K searches per month).
* Low to medium competition (keep in mind this metric relates to paid ads, but it still gives a rough idea of keyword viability).

• **Look for Trends**: Use the **“Year-over-Year Change”** metric to identify keywords with growing popularity. For example, if **“solo board games”** or **“board games for couples”** shows a significant increase in search volume over the past year, it indicates rising demand.

 ***Pro Tip:*** *Export your keyword list and organize it by search volume and competition. This will help you prioritize effectively.*

**Use Google Trends: Validating Growth Potential**

Google Trends is a great tool for validating the potential of keywords identified in Keyword Planner. Here’s how to integrate it into your workflow:

• **Check Seasonal Trends**: Search for your keyword in Google Trends to see its popularity over time. For example, “**board games**” might spike in the winter months, indicating seasonal demand.

• **Compare Related Keywords**: Use the comparison feature to check multiple related keywords. For instance, compare “**solo board games**” and “**board games for couples**” to see which has the most consistent or growing interest.

• **Spot Emerging Trends**: Look at related queries and “rising” terms for ideas that are gaining traction but aren’t yet oversaturated.

***Pro Tip:*** *Filter by location and timeframe to get insights tailored to your target audience (e.g., “United States” and “past 12 months”).*

**Leverage Ahrefs: Deep Dive into Keyword and Competitor Analysis**

If you can afford Ahrefs, even for a month, it can add a lot of depth to your research.

• **Check Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: Ahrefs provides a **Keyword Difficulty** score, helping you identify terms that are easier to rank for. Combine this with the volume data from Keyword Planner for a more informed decision.

• **Analyze Competitor Pages**: Enter the top-ranking URLs for your target keywords into Ahrefs’ **Site Explorer**. Look for:

* Content gaps: Topics or subtopics that competitors missed.
* Backlink profiles: Opportunities for your site to acquire similar backlinks.

• **Discover Long-Tail Keywords**: Use the “Questions” feature in Ahrefs to find long-tail variations of your keywords. These are often easier to rank for and attract highly targeted traffic.

• **Monitor Trends with SERP Features**: Ahrefs shows which SERP features (e.g., featured snippets, FAQs) dominate for a given keyword. This insight can help you optimize your content format.

**How to Combine These Tools Effectively**

1. **Start Broad (Keyword Planner)**: Use Google Ads Keyword Planner to generate a list of potential keywords with volume and competition data.

2. **Refine and Validate (Google Trends)**: Cross-check these keywords in Google Trends to identify seasonal patterns and validate their growth potential.

3. **Deep Dive (Ahrefs)**: For your top 10–20 keywords, use Ahrefs to:

* Assess competition.
* Analyze top-ranking pages.
* Discover long-tail variations.

4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process for additional keyword ideas, refining your list as you go.

**Final Tip**\*: The sweet spot is identifying keywords with:\*

*•* ***High search volume.***

*•* ***Low keyword difficulty (KD).***

*•* ***Consistent or growing interest over time.***

*•* ***Room for unique content (e.g., underserved niches or content gaps).***

# 3. Why Buying a Good Domain Name Is Important

Your domain name is the cornerstone of your website’s identity. It’s the first impression potential visitors get, often before they’ve even clicked through to your site. Imagine browsing search results for information about coffee brewing. Would you trust [**coffeelovers.org**](http://coffeelovers.org/) or **best-coffee-for-you123.info**? The difference is stark, and it shows why your choice of domain matters. A well-chosen domain can establish trust, improve visibility, and make your site memorable, while a poorly chosen one can do the opposite.

**Extensions Matter Too**

While the coveted **.com** extension is often the first choice, it’s not the only viable option. In fact, alternatives like **.org** or **.net** can lend credibility, especially for non-commercial or informational sites. For instance, a directory for community art projects might thrive with a name like [**localarts.org**](http://localarts.org/), suggesting a resource-driven platform. Meanwhile, opting for an unusual or unfamiliar extension — think **.xyz** or **.biz** — can raise red flags for users accustomed to more traditional domains.

# Good and Bad Examples Speak for Themselves

***Good Examples:***

1. [**bookfinder.org**](http://bookfinder.org/) — Straightforward, professional, and clearly conveys its purpose.

2. [**studyresources.net**](http://studyresources.net/) — Focused and reliable, suitable for an educational platform.

3. [**localarts.org**](http://localarts.org/) — Suggests a trustworthy and community-driven resource for art projects.

4. [**healthdirect.org**](http://healthdirect.org/) — Clean and professional, ideal for a healthcare directory.

***Bad Examples:***

1. [**books-4u-online.info**](http://books-4u-online.info/) — Cluttered with unnecessary symbols and a weak extension.

2. [**studies-helper101.biz**](http://studies-helper101.biz/) — Overly generic and unprofessional, with a questionable extension.

3. [**local-artz.xyz**](http://local-artz.xyz/) — Misspelling and unfamiliar extension reduce credibility.

4. [**healthfindersnow123.com**](http://healthfindersnow123.com/) — Hard to remember and untrustworthy due to random numbers.

***Pro Tip***\*:\* *When brainstorming a domain, imagine telling someone about it verbally. If you’d need to explain the spelling, symbols, or numbers, it’s not the right choice. Stick with clarity and simplicity to make your site easy to trust and revisit.*

# 4. Backlink Building and Why It Is Important

Backlinks are the lifeblood of SEO. They signal to search engines that your website is valuable and trustworthy, helping you rank higher and attract more visitors. For new websites, backlinks are even more critical — they’re like a stamp of approval that gets you noticed. But not all backlinks are created equal. Here’s how to build them the right way.

**List Your Website on Relevant Directories**

Directories aren’t just for directories — they’re a solid starting point for any website. Find directories that are closely related to your niche and list your site there. Be selective. Posting your link on random, irrelevant directories will do more harm than good, spoiling your website’s profile in the eyes of search engines.

***Pro Tip***\*: If your website is about sustainable fashion, list it on directories focused on eco-friendly living, fashion resources, or green business tools. Avoid directories that are generic dumping grounds for random links — they can hurt your credibility.\*

**Engage on Social Media**

Social media platforms like Facebook groups or Twitter threads can also be effective. The key is to engage authentically. No one likes a spammer, but everyone appreciates a valuable resource.

**Comment on Blogs and Articles**

Find blogs, news articles, or discussion threads relevant to your website’s niche. Comment thoughtfully and add your link only when it adds value. Even if these links are “nofollow” (meaning they don’t pass much SEO value), they still help with visibility and may drive direct traffic.

For instance, if your website is about home fitness, look for articles about workout trends, leave insightful comments, and link to your site where it genuinely contributes to the conversation.

**Work Long Enough, and Opportunities Will Find You**

Building backlinks takes time, but here’s the thing: if you consistently create high-quality content and keep improving your website, opportunities will come your way. Influencers will notice your work, bloggers will link to it, and other websites will want to collaborate.

Patience is the name of the game. Focus on making your website so good that people can’t ignore it. Keep improving, keep sharing, and let your work speak for itself.

# 5. Future of programmatic SEO

The rise of AI is reshaping how people interact with information online. Standard content-based websites are at risk of becoming obsolete as AI generates instant answers to questions. But directories and programmatic SEO projects built around datasets have a unique advantage — **they offer functionality that AI or plain text cannot replicate effectively.**

When users need to compare multiple options — whether it’s products, services, or anything else — a text-based AI response just doesn’t cut it. The best user experience for comparisons is visual and interactive. Think side-by-side comparisons, sortable tables, and detailed filters. These are features that programmatic SEO excels at, and they’re something AI simply can’t deliver in a conversational format.

For example:

• **Visualization**: Allow users to explore data through graphs, heatmaps, or charts.

• **Interactive Comparisons**: Enable users to scroll through lists, filter by specific attributes, or compare options side by side.

• **Niche-Specific Insights**: Build tools tailored to your dataset, like calculators, personalized recommendations, or resource aggregators.

In a future where AI dominates traditional Q&A searches, programmatic SEO websites that focus on functionality and unique datasets will thrive. They won’t just provide information — they’ll empower users to interact with it in ways that AI-generated text cannot.",2,1737301624.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

It all started in my early 20s after I took the birth control Yazmin for a short period of time. Ever since then, I have not been able to kick the acne permanently (despite switching off the pill). I took a short course of accutane when I was about 27, and it completely cleared for a number of years, but since then I've had children, etc. for a period of time after I had all my kids, I was on HRT for testosterone because I had basically zero. However, it brought my acne back bad, so I quit. I tried doxycycline for a month or two with no change, and I switched to spironolactone 100 mg about a month ago. It's raging with no change so far, and I'm so self conscious and frustrated.

I'm considering trying to cut dairy to see if it's the cause (my favorite food). I drink milk in my coffee, and I eat cheese with pretty much every meal. This would be a major change for me. I have no other issues like bloating, belly aches, or anything like that. Just wanted to see if you thought cutting dairy could help? Or is there testing I can get somewhere that could help me identify the cause? I hate this. Thanks for any advice. ",1,1737301515.0,30PlusSkinCare,1,1.0,False

1i51b4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/pilates/comments/1i51b4d/new_pilates_experience_as_a_guy_long_review/,new Pilates experience as a guy (long review),"TL DR; Thank you everyone for making Pilates such a wonderful experience, I greatly benefited and low-key am starting to feel obsessed with Pilates.  I recommend everyone give Pilates a try!

=====

A bit on my history: I'm a 49 year old guy.  While I'm really happy with my fitness progress over the last few years, I want to take things to the next level in terms of starting to develop many muscles I haven't been targeting yet (particularly core), starting to work on flexibility and mobility, and getting some kind of group meditative aspect in.

I was torn between Yoga, Pilates, and Barre and chatted with a number of friends who have experience in those.  I recently met a new friend at a party who is a self-described ""hard-core Pilates girlie"" and she sold me on Pilates quite effectively, both in broad terms as well as her specific studio.  I began taking mat Pilates at her studio about a month ago, around 2x/week and love it so much!

I'll delve into some common questions as well as things specific to me and my experience.  Keep in mind I've only been to a single studio so some of this could be quite different studio to studio, but hopefully still provides a perspective.  While I decided on Pilates primarily based off one of my friend's recommendations, reading various reviews on this subreddit was a factor as well so I wanted to pay it back a bit.

# core

One of my primary goals was to develop my core muscles, and it's been absolutely incredible in this regard.  As early as 2 weeks into it, I could actually feel the beginnings of my core muscles for perhaps the first time in my life.

# flexibility + mobility

Another of my primary goals was improving flexibility + mobility + balance.  Pilates has really delivered here, just walking around day to day, I feel more cat-like or something.  It's subtle but it's still such an incredible feeling.

I also follow longevity research and one thing that's come out is how essential it is for everyone to get in some mobility exercise each week, which I've never previously done.

# broad range of muscles

My strength training previously just targeted a few specific arm muscles and I miss most (even major) muscle groups.  As far as I can tell, Pilates is improving every single muscle in my body including many I didn't know I had.  It's helping fill out the gaps really well.

# judgement + vibes

My studio is possibly one of the more trendy ones, I'd guess 75% of the students are in fantastic shape, seem really skilled, and are wearing well-fit, probably expensive clothing.  That said, not a single person has come across as judgmental and I often get words of encouragement from various students after class, things like ""you're doing great"", ""stick with it dude!"".   The teachers are super supportive and I never feel singled out for being a beginner or guy or treated in anything but a really welcoming, positive way.  I'm the only guy in about half the classes, and in the other half, there are 1 or 2 other guys.   I'm guessing it's about 95% women on the whole.

# difficulty level

I'm beginner level and most of the students are advanced.  It's billed as an all skill levels class, and the teachers give customizations where they give you specific and simple ways to increase or decrease the difficulty.  I sometimes have to rest on the mat for a few seconds here and there, and I'm only doing some of the exercises at about 10% the difficulty level the teacher is doing.  In a few cases, I'm doing the full difficulty or something close to it but I'm generally quite short of it.  Nobody seems to care, everyone's focused on themselves and the teachers tell me I'm doing great at the end.  It doesn't feel competitive at all.  

Pilates is the most challenging workout I've ever done but I also greatly enjoy it and feel I'm getting the most overall benefit.

# clothing

I switch up my clothing from time to time depending on the weather, my mood, laundry and really just being random to keep things fun.

For tops, I wear tight to moderately tight fitting yoga shirts, typical athletic shirts, and compression short-sleeve sports baselayer t-shirts.

For bottoms, I always wear compression baselayer underwear that's tight fitting.

Over the baselayer, I wear athletic sweat shorts, jogging shorts, tight shorts, men's Yoga shorts, or tights.  I'm particularly a fan of 4-rth at the moment but will eventually try more brands and types.  Most of these are tight fitting.   

I can definitely see how most guys would be super uncomfortable wearing some of the clothes that I wear these days.  In most cases, guys will feel better (less self-conscious) wearing clothes that greatly minimize bulges and all that.  You can always do what I did which was start with the very common, modest athletic stuff that guys generally wear to gym and in a variety of athletic situations (this is what the handful of other Pilates guys I've seen wear).  If desired, later on, you can try out a variety of other types of clothes over time and see if something else feels better.

Personally, the tighter fitting clothes like tights feel noticeably more comfortable and functional so that's what I usually wear these days.  It feels like I'm putting on my battle armor which I like.  They feel so so good!  

As far as I can tell, they aren't making anyone uncomfortable, and if they did, I'd of course switch what I wear as I want to be respectful to all the other students but hopefully I can continue to wear ""the good stuff.""

# social

I sometimes make casual conversation with another student or two, but I'm extremely extrovert and being social is definitely not expected or required.  At least half the class just quietly comes in and leaves without really saying a word to anyone else.  Some of us like to chat and a few have been particularly friendly or even a bit flirty in subtle ways but always low-pressure and respectful.  I'll invite some of them to a friendly coffee or brunch at one point.

# meditation

My studio mixes in a brief but powerful meditative element.  It helps reduce stress and adds further positive ambiance and good vibes to the class.

Loose Auga would be painfull for the Minmatar Corps staging their, so after Amamake fell they started deplexing any spawn right away and running advantage.

With some of our greatest warriors taking a rest from the efforts of the last week, our FC team decided to start poking Auga a bit and squeeze some fun fights out of our rusty friends.

We started with placing down propaganda beacons and running all the plexes which triggered quick responses and resulted in 3-4 hours of constant fighting and multiple reshipping.

Our Nano Omen Navys did a good job for the start but after Minmatar decided to upship into Marauders, Tornados and Capitals, we needed to do the same and switched to Prophecy Navys and Guardians.

Minmil FC Team did not believe in itself and seemed to have forgotten about the ancient technique of Ramming CFIs into us. They formed Barghests with Logi Loki and Huggin Support instead, thinking that their 30b fleet can outproject and fight us.

Unaware of our secret skill ""Combat Scanning"" reports told me that Casper Sullivan dropped his cup of coffee when 12 PNIs and 3 Guardians warped on top of his pirate battleship fleet. He immediatly started to panic warp and left some his friends behind to get slaughtered by us.

After repeating that manouver for 2 times and not beeing able to kill anything on grid, they finally decided to brawl us with CFIs. After forming for 45 minutes they jumped right on top of us and we punched each other in the face.

Due to overwhelming DPS we lost one Guardian very fast, but stabilized and started killing them afterwards. Unfortunally we ran out of cap sticks and every CFI we killed instantly reshipped. Due to this broken Minmatar respawn Mechanic (CCPlease fix this!) we needed to warp off and had a somewhat even trade for both sides on the battlereport. Minmatar managed to hold grid this time and destroy our propaganda beacon!

We switched into doing Nano Cruisers / Hit and run stuff and had some good engagements, though i managed to make a terrible warp in once and landed right on top of a t2 frigate gang with beam laser omen navys. We got pretty much slaughtered and needed to warp off after a short fight.

Catched some blingy targets like 1,2b Devoter and 1b Loki here and there and reshipped a couple of times to brawl with the frigates. Called it a day and took a break.

After cooling down this message hit me on discord:

Sedition has killed our only blackbird Jam in the CFI fight earlier allthough we agreed that we let them on grid to watch the fight ... this was not forgotten.

While part of the Militia formed ultra strong chad Redeemers, the other part jumped into round about 20 tackle frigates. Rumors tell, one of the guys multiboxed 7 punishers.

After setting the trap up and watching Puke take 10 years for a ice heist with his mega navys, we saw a Revelation from Sedition warp arround. We got a bit excited and undocked the 20 tackle frigates, trying to catch it on the site. Missed the opportunity unfortunally. Thinking Puke would have smelled something by now after seeing 20 tackle frigs jumping on his dread, we were teached better by him. He simply moved his mega navys into a mining OP, which is a open grid without gate. Perfect for us ...

We got hyped and undocked everything to go for it, which resulted in a cruel massacre of Pukes battleship fleet.

GF to Puke, he took it like a real man and simply GFed us without a lot of drama.

After another short break, we started roaming around again and i spotted Ninlaras Golem pasing by my Ceptor. As Ninlara is the biggest shit talker in Eve and the only person i have blocked, i got very excited, threw my coffee cup off the table, and immediatly crushed gate back to catch him.

Saw him starting the warp, pointed and established orbit. All dudes on comms got ready to jump our kitchesink stuff + some escalation Battleships on it.

I zoomed deeeeeeep into Ninlara to see when he would start to MJD. Animation started, scram and MWD overheated + approached and stopped the MJD.

Ninlaras fate was sealed and we laserd his ass. Probably a lot of Minmatar people also applauded us for that, given Ninlaras relation to most people in the game.

Despite that a hand full of Minmatar loyalists tried to help him and warped in additional marauders + unlimited amounts of small stuff.

They managed to out-escalate us and kill a battleship + a multiboxed tornado wing. Shit happenz!

In the beginning he was so sweet and complemented me, brought me gifts and flowers, planned dates for us, etc. 

Now it has almost completely stopped. He is constantly criticizing me for the most random of things. First he makes fun of me for not cooking and will insist I come into the kitchen to watch him so I can learn. He makes fun of me to his family for not being able to cook, but if I cook something he will blatantly go out of his way to not even eat a singular bite of it. If we are late for something he will go on and on about how I make him look bad even when i'm not the reason we are late. He will mention that he needs something such as socks, so i'll grab him a pair of socks at the store, and he'll go out of his way to say that those aren't the socks that he wanted. If I grab him a drink at the grocery store to let him know i'm thinking of him he will refuse to drink it saying ""he doesn't drink that type of coffee anymore because it's so bad for you"" even though he was just drinking that coffee and will proceed to buy it for himself later in the week. I'll do laundry and put away his clothes for him and let him know i put them away, and he says things like ""I see that, I would have said thank you if you weren't so obviously seeking for me to say thank you, what do you think your job in the relationship is?"" 

He will also tell me all of these things that he bought me or is going to do for me, but these alleged ""gifts"" that he bought never arrive. He talked for months about how he had this extravagant birthday planned for me, and how he bets my ex has never spent that amount of money on my birthday. When my birthday rolled around he treated it just like a regular day and played his video game. Not that I was expecting some grand gesture but it's the fact that he went out of his way for MONTHS To let me know he was planning something spectacular to pretty much ignore me the entire day when it arrived. 

If I express something bothers me it seems that he purposely continues to do it to get a reaction, so I decided to stop reacting. He will criticize me to the point of tears and then tell me that i'm too sensitive and that he shouldn't ""have to endure me crying"" when I chose to be in a relationship with him. 

He also repeatedly goes through my phone and has gotten mad when I ask chat gpt for relationship advice because ""I don't tell chat gpt the whole story"" he goes through my notes app, messages between my sister and friends. He has gone to the extent of turning on an old phone of mine to monitor the texts that come in and out.  

I haven't definitely have not been perfect and definitely get overly emotional sometimes, but it feels like I can NEVER even come to a compromise or a solution with him as he says that I am the reason behind every argument. When i suggest couples therapy he says that we don't need therapy and that I need therapy. 

He has lied to me about how many children he has, he gave me an STD and lied about it , repeatedly tells me that every girl he ever has dated is a 10/10, brags about getting whoever he wants, likes and interacts with inappropriate pics on social media, also he is a male stripper. 

I can't exactly blame him for the stripper thing because i've known that about him since i met him. but a few months into dating he asked me if I had a problem with him stripping, and i replied that it's not a big deal but I don't exactly love it . he said that's fine and he won't do it after this contract is up in the summer, because i'm more important and he doesnt want to do it if I don't like it. 

Well now, months after telling me this, he says that's he decided that it's best for him financially if he continues to strip until he's done with school in 2 years. I was kinda mad bc he lead me to believe for months that he was going to stop soon. I told him I felt like he lied to me and he said he didn't lie because he's telling me now and that I knew what I signed up for when I started dating him. Now it seems like every weekend that he goes 2 hours away to strip he goes out of his way to not keep me updated, not answering my texts for hours. I haven't said anything or hounded him to text me, but it feels like he's trying to antagonize me so I will say something and he can accuse me of trying to start an argument. 

When I ask for emotional support he will tell me to ""grow up"" and says he can support me however he wants to. I constantly feel like something is wrong with me and that I'm the problem. I'm just starting to feel like I can do/deserve a lot better. 

I'm currently avoiding him so I can process everything that has gone on, as this has been a super hard past year for me in other aspects of my life and he kinda caught me at a vulnerable time of life. ",1,1737300859.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

Coffee seems to get more flavors during the extraction even though it's much harder to achieve the proper extraction zone (9 bars). 

  
There is also no information in the manual on how to use the coffee option. The recommended default grind settings of 9- 7 seem to be too low for coffee. It's more likely 5-3 in order to get to 8-10 bars for a single basket with about 9-10 grams of coffee.

I'm a family of 5, my father works almost everyday and goes out whenever he has free time, my oldest sister is in college, my mother works on weekdays, 3 days at the office, 2 days she works from home and my youngest sister goes boarding school while I go to regular school.My relationship with them has been civil, my parents always prioritised work and phones, and no one wants to talk to me. even if I try to talk, they won't respond and ignore me. 
since I was little, Ive always been taught to do housework because according to my father it so I can serve my future husband well. (for some reason, I'm the only that has always been taught to do housework while my sisters barely do anything unless asked, sometimes) 
because I'm the only one home, I've been tasked with all the chores (washing dishes, doing laundry, hanging laundry to dry, throw out the trash, throw out cats poop, arranging dishes, ironing clothes, folding clothes). everytime I ask them to help, my father always said he's tired from work and my mother always forget. 
I'll admit I hate doing the chores but I still do it anyway because my parents will get mad if I don't. examples:
1.when I was 13 y/o, I was annoyed from my father telling me to hang the clothes and ironing his clothes when i was ironing my school clothes i can't hide my emotions, so my father could tell from my face that I was 'mad'. he then proceeded to berate me saying I don't do much around the house. while berating me, he was holding his dishes. he always leaves his dishes in the sink so I figured I'd take it from his hand. I was holding back tears and he finished berating me. I tried to take his plate and cup but he pulled back, causing his hot coffee to splatter on my hand. he asked what I was doing and my mother intercepted saying I'm taking the plates to wash it. he then glared at me before going to work. 
2.another time, my mother said I don't do anything around the house after i forgot to wash the dishes. 
3.i had accidentally wash my school clothes with a new outfit my mom bought me. so it bled to my school clothes. my mom said to soak it in bleach and I did, I dont remember exactly what happened but my oldest sister said in a condescending tone to use my brain before doing laundry. I honestly didn't know.
4.its the school holidays and my youngest sister is home. she doesn't help around the house and always curses at me. she also doesn't shower for long periods of time and leave every room a mess
5.i go to school by bus and have to gout quite early. once, I forgot to hang the clothes to dry and when I got home at like 7 pm, my father got mad at me because I didn't do the chores, I then had to wash the clothes again while my father berated me. 
6.my mom doesn't defend me everytime I get berated. once, I was frustrated no one wanted to help me and cried while hanging the clothes, my mom saw it and got annoyed, saying don't do it if don't want to. here the thing, my mother will often forget about these tasks, leaving me to do it in the morning. I was annoyed and lashed out at her, screaming. I'll admit that was bad she the went up and called my father. my father called me forcing an answer out me on why I was crying
 I didn't want to and he said he will force me when he comes home. I got scared because I didn't want to get hit so I screamed at him. he proceeded to scream back and tells me to wait for him. after more back forth I just lied and said I was lazy and didn't want to the housework. I then went up and went to my mother's room, she opened her arms, as if wanting to comfort me. she always does this. she calls my father everytime she has a disagreement with me and makes the situation worse. 
these examples are just one out of the many. 
tonight, my mother got mad at me because my father didn't do his dishes (she often let it out at me) so I messaged my father, 'next time wash your dishes' i was honestly just reminding him. he didn't take it well, I tried to calm him down because if he loses his temper I worry he'll hit me with a hanger, throw something at me or threatens to smash my head against the wall. turns out, the only reason he was mad is because he was frustrated and because I didn't say pls. he also forbid me from doing housework (he often does this when I complain about housework). in the end, I said I was wrong and rude to him. 
it always end this way, I'm always the ungrateful child. 
I don't want to stay here anymore, at least until school opens. I've asked my mother if I can stay at my grandmother's house and is waiting for a reply. ",3,1737300735.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1i510ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i510ik/increased_odd_twitching_shaking_and_muscle/,"Increased odd twitching, shaking, and muscle tightening type things","Hello :) Been having something odd going on and just curious if there's an idea of what it could be. I'm describing in the best ways I can think of to, sorry in advance if I didn't do a great job at it :)

Age: 46  
Sex: AMAB  
Taking: buproprion, limotrigene, and atorvistatin.  
Former heavy drinker, quit somewhere I think around 3 years ago   
Former smoker, quit somewhere around 15 years ago  
I drink quite a bit of coffee and always have, but now it's almost completely made with decaf.

Some doctor said I had something to do with nephropathy like 4 or 5 years ago.  
I have a couple other issues that doctors have kinda ignored that I don't know if they're relevant. The main ones being:  
\- What *seems* to me to be similar to what I read fibro flares to be like. These have been worse each time it has happened, but generally only happen like once a year. I was told to get more exercise.  
\- Occasional wooziness that will make me have to grab hold of something to keep from falling over, at times my vision starts to kind of go away when it happens. It happens the most when I'm turning to the side or around, but also happens when standing still or walking straight. I was given a tilt table test and I passed out, but they used that horrible nightmarish drug stuff created out of pure evil. I was told to drink more water. More than the 1+ gallon I already drink. And to drink electrolytes, which I have yet to be able to fit in my budget.  
\- Undiagnosed MCS/fragrance allergies

Pulled from my medical chart:  
Heart murmur  
Irregular heartbeat - side note, I can often feel my heart beating when just sitting there, not after activity. My understanding is that's not a normal thing?  
Hyperlipidemia  
Heart block - iirc this was something like a 'right bundle branch block'  
Some mental (psych) things I can add if needed.

Do not recall time-frames for the below. I've had random odd twitches (more than what I know of other people) for a long time. Like, whole body kinda jumps, or neck turns head to the side type of things.

A while back I started having my lower arm just kind of fling out/jump for no reason. Or, like when using my computer mouse, would twitch enough to send the mouse cursor across the screen. I'd also have my leg kick out in my sleep at times, but my doc brushed these off as nothing and I assume the leg thing is.

I started having kind of a twitchy shudder and my pelvis would thrust forward sometimes when laying down. It started kind of minor and has increased over time. A few times, it felt kind of like electricity went from the back of my neck, down my spine, and into my lower body, but this hasn't happened in a while that I recall.

Semi recently, when it happens I've started having what I guess I would describe as a convulsion either in a single leg or from the waist down and muscles will tighten up. When my foot muscles tighten, it will usually make my toes curl up tight. It was happening only when laying down, but has increased in frequency and I've started having it while sitting as well (which is what made me want to ask about it). At times there is a needle poking feeling in the sole of my left foot before it will tighten up, but not always. Usually, any of these things only last for like maybe 3 or 4 seconds or so at most.

I also have random kind of shaky shutter things in my limbs here and there that last a second or few, the small jerking movements, and small series of muscle twitches. Sitting, standing, doesn't matter. The jerking movements and muscle twitches seem to be occurring more often as well.

She has been prescribed PPI and another medication but nothing is allowing her to sleep at night. She doesn't have coffee, tea, fried greasy food, tomatoes, chocolate, dairy, and follows all the precautions and still gets bloated at night time and has to constantly burp but cant and cannot sleep. If she sleeps, it is for 2 to 3 hours max. 

She does all the exercises we have found all over the internet, but nothing helps. On top of it, my mom has a pacemaker so sleeping on her left side is not comfortable. She also cannot do botox as it is already hard for her to swallow due to some medication so botox can make it worse.

We got her a wedge pillow which is also not helping. My mom is such an optimistic upbeat person and this is completely destroying her right in front of my eyes. Is there any solution to this or does she just live like this? Is surgery the only option?

I put exactly 300 grams of water into the base and my usual 29 grams of beans. 

I maintained a low heat until it reached halfway to bottom of the poor spout and turned off the heat and let it do its thing until the brew stopped. 

Afterwards, I measured the yield and I had brewed only 124 grams of coffee (roughly 40%). Now I know there should be some water leftover, but generally, how much water should someone expect to have left over after a brew because 60% seems kind of wasteful.

**One of the more lengthy arguments btw gen x and gen z** - https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTok/comments/1i4ptv7/i_feel_lonely_in_a_way_that_makes_absolutely_no/m7zhqg5/

>Oh for God's sake. Go outside. Actually meet people. Form groups and do things together like every generation before you did for all of human history. Even in a small town, you can find people to hang out with who have mutual interests if you try. 

I'm Gen X. I was a feral kid who practically lived outside when I wasn't in school and growing up all of my connections were face to face. I cannot fathom going into a public forum and complaining about how I feel so cut off because an app was shut down. And don't hand me some sob story about how some people have this or that limitation when it comes to leaving the house. Yes , I'm certain some people are limited in their ability to leave their house, but the reality is most Tik Tok users are perfectly capable of going out and socializing. Instead, they've chosen to make apps and social media their entire interaction with the rest of humanity. That's not healthy and it never will be. I've seen about a dozen posts this morning across the different social media platforms I frequent and they're all versions of this same lament you've posted here. Talk about a tempest in a teacup.

I don't use Tik Tok. I'm familiar with what it is and I've even been on it briefly, but there's nothing there that was that appealing for me, so as someone who specifically chooses to go outside and do things in person, I actually find these reactions funny. It's meant to be entertainment, not a lifestyle. A don't even get me started on how worthless the app is for getting news that isn't laden with conspiracy theories and misinformation. Anyone who gets their news solely from Tik Tok is not well informed, no matter how much they've convinced themselves they are.

> As a gen z, may I ask an honest question? (Fair warning that you might see this as a “sob story” as you said, but I’m not whining, it’s just facts. How are we supposed to go out and make friends in this world, when some of us can’t drive anywhere cuz we don’t have a car, because we can’t pay for one, because the older gens won’t give us jobs? (and yes, I went to college and hold a degree) and even if we did, where are we supposed to go to meet people? My mom is gen x, and she said people used to hang out at malls, and fast food places, etc. now, you go to those places and there aren’t many young people like there used to be. We don’t have a physical “third place”. My town doesn’t really have any clubs or community events for things I’m interested in. TikTok (and i suppose Reddit) is/was the closest we had. And most people you do see, are busy doing their own thing. So tell me, what are we to do? Go up to random people in stores/coffee shops and be like “hey, I’m John Doe, wanna be friends?” Cuz that doesn’t actually seem like the best approach. When’s the last time you went up to a stranger, talked for a while, and then kept in contact afterwards? I wish it were that easy, I long for actual face to face, and I wish at times I’d be born in your time and grew up the same way, but that’s much harder in the world we live in now. I wish no hate to you, or gen x. I only wish you’d try to understand a little. (And honestly, if you could provide me with a clear understanding of your perspective as well, I’d be glad to listen. I’m all ears for solutions, provided they’re not just hating on us for being online) Just so you know, I had friends in highschool, but we grew apart for various reasons, so I’m very capable of talking face to face.

**Hate against Reddit and other app section, also my friends are dead**

> Idk why it feels like I lost a friend almost. It pisses me off that all these people on Reddit just hate on us because we liked an app. Pretty sure everyone is addicted to something because it helps them get by day to day. I liked TikTok cuz it distracted me, I got to see cool stuff, talk to people and relate to them and help shelter animals get adopted. I guarantee you that most these people taking shit probably used the app at least a couple times and if their source of escape or favorite apps, games, tv shows etc whatever were taken away they’d feel like shit too. I’m not even just sad about tik tok. I’m sad about a shit ton of stuff going on in the world and it’s just gonna keep going downhill from here. https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTok/comments/1i4ptv7/i_feel_lonely_in_a_way_that_makes_absolutely_no/m7ysfts/

1i50x0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1i50x0r/pga_national_review/,PGA National Review,"Just at the airport after a 3 day trip to PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens. Overall had a great time. Some tips / info

1. We got the golf package which includes 18 holes per night stay, unlimited range balls and golf cart. The latter two perks - range balls and cart - would be included in any round of golf. 

2. The rooms were nice. There are so many different opinions on this. I just checked out and I can say for our room, on the first floor, it was totally pleasant. I shared the room with my 21 year old son and it was spacious and comfortable.

3. The food is overpriced and bad. But the atmosphere is nice. Birdie's breakfast: the only thing I liked was the omelette. The coffee isn't great. The breakfast and Honeyduke's was also mediocre. I got the eggs / sausage. Do not order the Honey Bun it's a gooey mess. Breakfast on average was $60. 

4. The hotel shuttle is as great perk you just have to book it a bit in advance. You'll need it for the Estate course which is surprisingly far from the hotel. 

5. Ubers in general take 15+ minutes to arrive so just factor this into your local travel time if you don't rent a car.

6. If I had to do it again I would rent a car. I'd go to the local grocery store and buy snacks because they are so overpriced at the hotel ($5 for a Coke Zero I almost choked when I saw the receipt). 

7. On our way back from the Estate course we stopped at Jersey Mike's and got subs. So good and a fraction of what you'll pay at the hotel.

8. We had dinner one night at Coppers. It wasn't that great, but I liked the ambience.

9. We spent one night out in Palm Beach. The Uber there was an hour! And it took 15 minutes to arrive. It was a Friday night at 6 pm. Not sure how usual this is. Coming back it was 30 minutes. Uber was $50 on the way there $35 on the way back.

10. The clinics were great value. You sign up the day before. They are at 8 am. The first day we didn't have anybody else in our group so we got a semi private lesson! But even if there are others in the group you will get personal attention. And I find that having too much attention isn't always the best either.

11. The Match course feels kinda low end from what I'd expect. It weaves through many neighborhoods and sometimes it feels just too casual. I know it was designed for casual play but since the golf package is so expensive, I'd definitely use the 18 holes on the Fazio course only.

12. The Estate course was nice, but not as nice as Fazio. So again, if I do it again I'll use all of my credits on the Fazio course.

13. Pace of play varies. Sometimes it felt very fast and others we got stuck behind groups. I don't mind playing a bit slower so it was fine with me.

16. Do not rent clubs if you can help it. It costs a mind boggling $95 per day. It does include a box of Titleist golf balls which helps ease the pain. You can't take the clubs off campus.

1i50wtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1i50wtw/my_moms_and_other_peoples_treatment_towards_me/,my mom's (and other people's) treatment towards me horrifically affects how i view myself,"trigger warning for parental abuse, csa, torture, and just abuse in general.

idk how it even does. i always joke about how stupid and braindead i am, i have since i was a teenager (i am 23 now). but nowadays i genuinely believe it to where i believe it makes me unlovable and unimportant to others. 

my mom explodes at me a lot. i feel like im constantly walking on eggshells around her. the smallest things makes her mad. there are some things that makes sense for her to blow up at but most of it it isn't. and either way it's not acceptable for her to resort to name calling me and putting me down. a lot of the time i dont do anything to cause it. she's just mad that she spilled her coffee and then will go on a rampage about everything that annoys her and always ends up talking shit about me. calling me braindead, stupid, pathetic, selfish, and many other things. and mocking my emotions or how i cope with things which i will get into.

my mom's treatment of me growing up was weird. she very much has bpd but denies her own diagnosis because to her she's ""too numb"" and ""doesn't feel any emotion, not even love towards others"" and and is ""just depressed"". growing up she emotionally neglected me severely, a good portion of it i repressed or thought was normal until recently. i have very little memories of her actually spending time and bonding with me as a kid and comforting me when i needed it. most of the time she pushed me away and paid no attention to me. ffs she relied on other people to watch me (which sadly resulted in me experiencing horrific csa and torture by specific people she relied on that almost took my life countless times). growing up i felt no emotion coming from her except for moments where she would blow up and came to me for comfort, making me her little therapist. but if i needed comfort from her she shooed me away and complained about it. the times where she wasn't like this always felt weird too. lile there were times where she genuinely bonded with me but they rarely happened and it felt weird and out of place. i can count on my hand the amount of times she showed me affection as a kid. as a result of this i resorted to my stuffed animals and dissociation for comfort. i was sent to my room a lot for experiencing any negative emotion and i would just hold onto a stuffed animal and dissociate. i got more comfort from the friends and world in my head (which turned out to be did) than from my parents. growing up i imagined a perfect family to cope with my actual family dynamic to where i genuinely believed it. i felt unloved by my parents growing up so i made up scenarios where they acted like they loved me and then believed it happened. it's to where nowadays as an adult with amnesia towards my childhood, idk if anything good or bad i remember is truly accurate and neither parent will tell me if it's true. but i do remember my feelings growing up, no child who wasn't neglected and abused felt unlovable and like a burden. 

my mom became an alcoholic when i was 10, and lost custody of me when i was 11. my dad got custody of me and my younger siblings when i was going on 13. and my mom was out of the picture for my entire teen years and i genuinely hated her in those moments. my mom didn't fix herself until 2020 when i was 19 and didn't try getting back into my life until i was 20. and during that moment i genuinely thought she changed until i moved in with her and she started showing her true colors. she explodes at every small thing and makes me feel like im walking on eggshells. i didnt do the dishes for whatever reason? im a lazy piece of shit that does nothing but lay around all day (im the only person in the house who does the dishes). god forbid i actually take a day off of doing anything and take time to relax (or at least try to, most of my ""relaxing"" is me having to lay down because of my chronic pain and chronic illness/disability that leaves me bedridden) because she would use that as an example for a month until she forgets about it. she's so big on using our days off for chores but she ends up being the one laying in bed all day meanwhile i do stuff around the house (or she brings over her annoying alcoholic boyfriend over to do it, which he never does and the entire time he's here he acts up and is abusive). i just feel like im walking on eggshells around her. i constantly ignore my disabilities to do things to please her to where it just worsens it. and everything she says to me i start to believe and it heavily impacts how i view myself.

everytime she puts down my intelligence (even though i already have very little), my interests, my coping mechanisms that aren't harmful (like resorting to holding my stuffed animals for comfort), and just everything about me it impacts how i view myself and worsens my self esteem. i genuinely believe im a no good worthless childish dumbass. i am diagnosed with autism and adhd and deal with a lot because of it and try to fix myself and seek help for it and she recognizes i have those but in the moments where she's exploding at me she constantly tells me ""i don't understand you"", ""i don't understand your brain"", ""why are like this"", ""why are you this fucking stupid"", etc. ladt week i forgot to remind her that we start work 30 minutes early but i just assumed she remembered because she remembered the day before. but i didn't mention it until the last second and she got mad and started screaming at me and screamed at me the entire car ride there. saying ""you fucked yourself"", ""your too much of a selfish bitch you only care about yourself"", ""why are you like this"", ""why are you so fucking stupid"", ""you're a fucking idiot "", ""what the fuck is wrong with you"", ""you only care about yourself"", etc. she said the same things when she left her headlights on and blamed me for it.

over a month ago she left her headlights on but i was still in the car. i know nothing about vehicles, i cant drive and neither her or my dad bothered to teach me anything about driving and vehicles growing up. and she knows this, she knows that i dont even know how to work a car. ffs i didn't know what headlights are and i didn't know that the lights on the dashboard being left on drained the battery. i didn't know how to turn them on or off, i dont even know how to work a car aside from starting it and using the heat and radio. but they were left on and my dumbass didn't know they were supposed to be turned off when the car was off. when she came back hours later the car battery was dead and she exploded at me for it. she resorted to her usual name calling and putting me down. everything i quoted beforehand with other things like ""you're so fucking braindead"", ""why is your brain like this"", ""why are you like this"", ""how do you know nothing about cars at 23??"", ""if you were never taught you should have resorted to teaching yourself unless your too stupid for that too"", ""you're so fucking stupid"", etc. most i cant remember, i ended up dissociating and can't remember most of the night. i do remember later on when the car finally started after getting a jump she got pulled over by a cop for being on her phone and swerving (she was in a phone call with brother and she wasn't swerving, at to ke she wasn't). she blamed me for it and screamed at me for it and expected me to pay the ticket (i never got an update about the ticket price so idk about that). im not completely blame free of it, i should have known i just sadly didn't but i don't think she should have resorted to blowing up at me and calling me names.

a couple weeks ago we were viewing a house. there's issues going on within our current place so we're trying to find a new place. we went to a house viewing a couple weeks ago. it was just us, the landlord was sick and couldn't show up and the owner is a weirdo who doesn't like to be seen by tenants. we ended up having an issue with closing the lockbox before leaving. and the entire time we didn't know how to use it she put me down saying the usual stuff. i brought up the idea of asking the landlord through text or calling and she said ""well that would make me look stupid would it"" and gave me looks the entire process of calling him. he ended having to get the owner to close it (which we were told to leave before he got there because he doesn't like to be seen). 

there's so many instances like this but over smaller things like me forgetting to clean something or laying in bed (which most of the time is caused by my physical disabilities and chronic pain flaring up). or over something my siblings did which she never notices until they're gone and blames the mess they make on me and screams at me over it. or even over me eating food. she doesn't want me eating the stuff she buys and tells me to buy my own food and then i do that and she gets mad at me for it and calls me selfish. atp im just selfish for eating food so i avoid eating which sadly is worsening my eating disorder.

she also mocks my coping mechanisms. the only thing that helps me calm down when im upset and crying is holding onto a stuffed animal (i usually go to my Pikachu plushy) and dissociating. if im not overstimulated and dealing with my sensory issues flaring i will play video games or watch tv (i always go to the video games and tv shows from my childhood which is always pokemon related). when she sees it she mocks me and callse childish. ""you're 23 not 12, act like it"". and i start to feel awful for it. and i now see these coping mechanisms as childish and i feel embarrassed for having them at 23. but idk what else would helpe and be appropriate for my age. i had huge issues with self harm but replaced it with this instead but now i feel bad and embarrassed for it. 

everything she says horrifically affects how i view myself. atp i genuinely believe im too childish and stupid. im 23 i should act my age but i dont but idk how too. i genuinely believe that im too fucking stupid and just braindead .and i genuinely believe im unlovable and worthless because of it. my mom implies that nobody my age is like me and that no adult my age would want to hang out with me because of it. i genuinely believe nobody my age would be romantically interested in me. im aroace and already struggle with feeling attraction but i still want a relationship and friends but i feel like im too stupid and childish for anyone my age and older. and honestly i just feel like this in general. i feel like im incapable of being loved. i have felt this way my entire childhood due to my parents neglecting me and other family members telling me im unlovable. and i genuinely believe it's true, im not capable of being loved or cared about. if i was i would have been treated better my entire life. if i was capable of being loved my parents wouldn't have neglected me, other family members wouldn't hav horrifically abused and tortured me to where i almost died from it countless times, i wouldn't experience peers in school avoiding me because im too weird for them, i wouldn't have experienced anything like this if i was capable of being loved. so i genuinely believe im unlovable. why bother finding friends or partners if im not capable of being loved and cared about. why bother even living if im not capable of being loved and care about. i do get people telling me they care about me and love me but idk if it's even true. i feel like they're just lying to me because why love me or care about me when my parents, family, and peers never did (or at least never made me feel like they did). in the end im just a braindead and worthless idiot like my mom (and other people growing up) said and im just unlovable and incapable of being cared about or viewed as a person. im honestly just a robot because all i do is dissociate and try to please others to feel loved and accepted. im not human and never was. and im not capable of being loved.",1,1737300427.0,abusiveparents,0,0.99,False

Anyway, we eat lunch together and have a nice chat for maybe 15-20 minutes. I don’t know if I like her romantically so I was hesitant to get her contacts. I later thought I’d give it a shot anyway and got her email from the mailing list we were both on. I sent her an email saying how nice it was to meet her and have lunch with her etc. I gave her my social media contact and told her to let me know if she ever wants to have coffee or hang out. A few days later she follows me and emails me back. She said it was lovely to meet me and that she will be very busy for the next few weeks but that we should ‘definitely’ get coffee later on though. She told me to message her whenever I was around.

I feel her answer is somewhat ambiguous? I think it is plausible she might be really busy given that she is a super-focused graduate student. Yet her email doesn’t feel like she is very interested. What do you all think?

If you don´t know anything about this character I´ll provide a link to the show´s wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazbin_Hotel), and her character page on the fandom wiki [here](https://hazbinhotel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie_Morningstar).

T.L.D.R. She is the Lucifer & Lilith´s daughter and basically the Disney princess of hell.

Here is her musical number [Happy Day In Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH29SKJ_urg) from a teaser.

So here is my pitch: Chalie Morningstar as a Tabletop RPG Warlock patron.  
While technincally a Fiend pact patron, she basically acts more like a Fey patron.

She gives her warlocks a lot of independence, only really ""demanding"" one thing in every contract as standard, help recruit one more person. (Like the worlds most chill MLM) If they can´t, or don´t want to do that. They can ""work it of"" by doing various small harmless favours for her, and/or with time spent working at her hotel (should they go to hell when they die, which is very likely because they did just make deal to serve the anti-christ. Something even Charlie herself will acknowledge during the conversation.)  
She is always totally upfront about her contract, no loopholes or hidden clauses. What you see is what you get and she will event work out any problems you have with it, should you have any.  
While she will sign anyone who wants, but she clearly favours kid/teen/young-adult girls, as it allows her to give them the full magical girl treatment.

Her pact focus can come in a variety of forms should you ask for it but her standards are a Magical Girl wand or a Hellish Umbrella. (It works as a magical shield and magical staff, all the while looking like a realitively normal item.)  
The powers she bestows look slightly different depending her specfic warlock and the type of spell used, ranging from magical girl cute and colorful, to more bubblegum gothic with a sinister edge.  
She is also one of the only fiend patrons in the world that can be contacted via phone call or text message.  
(Though she will note, to only call her in case of emergencies, she has other things to do during the day after all. In all other cases a simple text will do.)

She isn´t believed to be a an outright villain by most (note *most* there). She is instead seen mostly as an extremely powerful chaotic neutral trickster due to the unintended consequences of her help whenever she arrives on earth, or even just the byproduct of her powers while among mortals.

Basically a more well meaning (but hellish) Mister Mxyzptlk or Bat Mite from DC (mixed with a little of Desiree from Danny Phantom).

What the game Mutants & Masterminds refers to as the Imp Archetype.



Here are some examples in the form of adventures you could play if this was Supers TTRPG Game.

(If anybody ever plays these as One Shots let me know.)



**Part of your world**

Charlie has decided to take a vacation day from the stresses of hell, by traveling to earth and just having a day to herself. Shopping, eating, partying, whatever. Getting into various hyjinx across town. At the same time various religous and occult heroes are traveling across town searching desperately, because all magical alarms are screeching about how a very powerful demon has just appeared on earth.



**Mine, mine, mine**

Charlie gave big tips to all staff at a local coffee shop/restaurant she stopped by, using gold coins from her fathers vault (she knows gold is worth alot on earth and it´s not her dad is going to miss it.) What she didn´t know was that the coins were cursed possesing the owners with extreme, uncontrollable greed and causing an immediate neighborhood crime spree. The curse can only be lifted by destroying the coins or sending them back to hell.



**A star is born**

News spreads across the occult world. An Antichrist has supposedly been born on earth. A bastard child of Lucifer whose existence may one day threaten the world. (or not, they are just a baby after all, not to mention they might not even be the devils kid.)

Charlie comes to earth in the city where the baby is to both see what she thinks might be her half brother, and to bring him alot of delayed baby shower gifts. She bring a large variety of magical and mundane items from across hell, looking all over town for their exact home.

At the same time various occult & religious themed heroes & villains are running wild all over town trying to steal them or find the baby first.



**When you wish upon a star**

Charlie goes to earth and wants to spread some good will, by being the whole city´s personal Genie.

She will travel in a giant pentgram pattern across the entire city using her powers to grant the wishes of every person she hears wishing for something out loud. (No matter how strange, dangerous or out of context they might sound, if it´s what they want, she won´t judge peoples desires.)

When she completes the pentagram, she travels to the middle of it, and using it´s power to grant the wishes of everyone in the city all at once.

Which as you can guess would spell absolute chaos. (She hasn´t really done the whole genie thing before so she might not get the wishes perfect, or haven´t really thought of the consequences of granting the wishes of ***everyone*** including the city´s many villains.)



**Friend like me**

Charlie has decided that you/your team are her new ""on earth"" friends. She sees that you are superheroes and thus decides to be hero as well, helping you out.

While initially helpful, she quickly also becomes a problem becasue since she´s fighting superpowered people. She holds back less than she needs to, causing increasingly significant collateral damage during fights. Not to mention the existence super powered people along with having grown up around sinners in hell all her life, has given her a bit of a warped idea of how durable mortal humans are.

""What do you mean he can´t grow his arm back, that guy we fought yesterday grew them back in instant.""

""Yes I threw him into orbit what about it? What do mean people can´t breathe in space, you do that all the time!?""



**Poor unfortunate souls**

An evil demon/wizard/whatever has finally been defeated by an occult hero, in their possession was a jar containing several entrapped human souls contained over a century ago.

This is powerful magical artifact which is known to be located somewhere in the city. Many powerful and/or powerseeking people are now out searching for it. Charlie is one of those people, wanting to take poor, traumatized and scared souls into the welcoming embrace of hell. A place they were obviously supposed to ago. They did make soul deals with evil people after all.



**I Wan'na Be like You**

Someone you or your team members know starts acting paranoid, talking about feeling watched & followed until they suddenly stop. Now they begin acting strange, remembering thing wrong and doing this they should not be able to.

When discovered and confronted about this, the disguise will drop and be revealed to be Charlie. She wanted to learn more about motrals on earth so she figured what better way to learn than to be one, at least for a while, just a decade or so. She will explain that she gave the real person a vacation in the......Ring. (Whatever ring most appropriate to the sins and personal flaws of that person.)



**Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo**

A young wannabe model wants to win the city´s beauty pageant. Desperate to win she was the last 2 years 3rd place winner) she prays to anyone who will listen for help.

Charlie heard and decided to help, by giving her 3 things before needing to go back home for an errand:

A beautiful´new dress. A self-driving Rolls-Royce. And a trio of ""experts on human beauty"".

What neither of the girls in question know is the consequences of these gifts. The car is a demon possesed killer car (basically Christine).

The experts are a trio of succubi who, because of the spell have a ""liberal"" interpertation of how to get her to win. One will alter her appearance. (Disguised as her ""make-up artist"") One will change her speech and if needed control her actions. (Disguised as her ""personal trainer"") One will eliminate any percieved threat to her victory. (Disguised as her ""Agent"")

And finally the dress is magical binding both the car and the succubi to her, making them all focused on ensuring her victory as well as allowing them to stay on earth until it´s done.



**Zero to Hero**

A new hero has appeared in town. A magical girl has seemingly shown up from nowhere. While very adorable, sweet, enthusiastic about doing good and on top of being *very effective* at getting rid monsters. A lot of concern beginns to rise up when starts using the same techniques she used on monsters on both superpowered and regular criminals. Those being summons ""monsters"" to attack them. Blast them with fireballs and/or sending them to ""the bad place"".

A little girl made a warlock pact with Charlie, so she can help her parents (both police officers) by making their work safer and easier. The first couple monsters she fought were demons sent by Charlie to act as training targets and jobbers to boost her confidence.



**Friends on the Other Side**

Charlie cheers up a sad child by giving them one of her old children´s books called ""how to make friends and influence people."" What Charlie forgot is that it was a basic for children´s spell book allowing them create ""Imaginary friends"" and have them do stuff for you. However that book is meant for ages 10 and up, not 8. So the child preform the spells incorrectly. Now their invisible ""friends"" can come and go as they please, as well as be a bad influence on them.

What hurts most isn't just what she said – it's that she'd been silently judging him all this time.

The main issue, apparently, was that my husband didn't pay his share at restaurants years ago. Instead of addressing this at the time, she chose to make excuses to avoid dining with us for years. My husband's ADHD and challenging upbringing might explain his social missteps, but I'm baffled why no one simply spoke up when it happened.

But she didn't stop there. She went on to criticize his driving, his personality, even his general demeanor – all while claiming she was just ""concerned about my happiness."" By the end of her tirade, I was visibly shaking.

This fits a pattern with my sister. She has incredibly high standards for others, which has already cost her several close relationships. Now I'm at a crossroads. I haven't told my husband what she said – I'm protecting him from this for now. Part of me wants to cut contact until I can process this, but I'm searching for a way to preserve our family bond without compromising my marriage.

1i50itl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i50itl,"SOWER - Lake Biwa, Shiga","Sower is a restaurant ran by a Californian chef (who previously worked at Benu, etc) located in L'Hotel du Lac, to the north of Lake Biwa. It's quite far from the nearest cities but they have a pickup service from the nearest station (Nagahara). The cuisine here isn't strictly Japanese or Western, but they source everything from Lake Biwa and the surrounding areas.

It was announced that the head chef was leaving back to the states, and the restaurant is currently run by the Japanese sous chef until the end of January when they will close down . They are only operating on the weekends (plus Fridays or Mondays) so next weekend (Jan 27th) will be the last day of operation. It seems they will reopen later at an unknown date. This information can be found in the Instagram @lhotel_du_lac. My visit was during the time the head chef was already absent. Bookings are taken via Tablecheck.

The lunch course is 13200 yen and dinner is 22000. I went for lunch and looking at some reviews, it seems the dinner menu only has extra couple dishes so I felt lunch was a better value for money. 

I went there by car and arrived quite early. The staff greeted me and escorted me inside the hotel and I waited in the nice waiting room with a coffee machine. I went for the lunch course at 12:30, but they open the doors to the restaurant at 12:00 so you can enjoy a welcome drink at the bar area. There was a choice for alcoholic/non-alcoholic.

Once you're seated at the main dining area, which was an L-shaped counter facing the open kitchen, you will see a sheet with a map of Lake Biwa denoting the exact locations where each ingredient, sake, and cutlery were sourced from.

- Sweet Potato, Amago, Bergamot: A chawanmushi dish. You would think it was ikura but it's actually the roe of Amago, an endemic fish from the salmon family. Herbal, sour, salty. This has the most ingenious flavor combo that I've had in a chawanmushi 👍👍👍
- Shiitake, Dried Duck Ham, Lemon: Grilled shiitake from Nagahama with shaved duck ham and kouji butter. The pungent notes from the duck ham, the comforting butter and subtly smoky notes makes this dish extra tasty 👍👍👍
- Crispy Taro, Egg Yolk, Heshiko: This is a fried satoimo with egg yolk sauce, and Heshiko is a dish of fermented mackerel which they shaved on top with some negi. Umami, rich, and crispy 👍
- Sunchoke, Kokabu Cheese, Roasted Kombu: Oven roasted kikuimo is the main ingredient. This feels like oven-roasted potato on crack and tasted super sweet. The sauce was cheese from Chiba and a puree of the kikuimo itself. It's very addictive and sourdough bread was given to scoop up the sauce. 👍👍
- Buri, Radish, Chinese Cabbage: Their take on ""Buri Daikon"", but tastes and nothing like it. The fish is straw-grilled and the daikon is roasted. The fish was perfectly cooked and fatty that some parts just melted away, and it has got to be one of the most flavorful daikon I've had. The crunchy greens and cabbage sauce gives this dish perfect balance flavor and texture-wise 👍👍👍
- Wild Deer, Carrot, Petite Veil: Served with three sauces (sour cream, red wine + vinegar, and I think another one from juniper berries). Again, the main ingredient is perfectly cooked. The carrot is sweet like a caramel candy, and the crispy leaf gives a dash of umami to cut through 👍👍👍
- Nigoi Rice: Rice cooked on a pot with Nigoi, a local fish, and some nuts. This was very good on it's own, but then you're given sansho powder which elevates it even more, and lastly some Nigoi dashi which you can drink, or optionally pour over the rice to turn it into somewhat of a chazuke. The broth is subtly fishy but I personally find it very comforting 👍👍
- Strawberry, Kuwasake, Hime Lemon: Strawberry on chiffon cake, kuwasake (a kind of liqueur) cream, and lemon olive oil. Sweet, tart, and fluffy. Very nice! 👍
- Hojicha cookie: Roasty, umami with caramel notes. Served with after-meal drink 👍

Each diner gets their own pot of rice, and any leftovers from the rice course will be made for a take-home onigiri.

Overall, the taste and execution of each dish were excellent and faultless, even without the head chef. When I received the bill, I also realized that the course and beverage prices are all inclusive so no extra service charge or taxes. The only downside was that portions were a bit small but given the price and level of service, this is still an absolute steal.

Master your reactions, master your day.The 90/10 Principle: It's Not What Happens, It's How You React","We've all been there. That morning where *everything* goes wrong. Spilled coffee, missed buses, traffic tickets... it feels like the universe is conspiring against you. But what if I told you the real culprit isn't bad luck, but your *reaction* to bad luck?  
This is the core of the 90/10 principle: 10% of life is what happens to you; 90% is how you react.  
Think about it: A coffee spill is just a spill. It's the yelling, the argument, the stressed-out driving that turns a minor inconvenience into a catastrophic day.  
**Example:** Imagine two scenarios:  


* **Scenario 1 (Negative Reaction):** Coffee spills. You explode. The day spirals into chaos – late for work, a ticket, a fight with your family.
* **Scenario 2 (Positive Reaction):** Coffee spills. You take a deep breath, clean it up, and move on. The day might still have its hiccups, but your calm response prevents a domino effect of negativity.

**The Takeaway:** You can't control every event life throws your way. But you *can* control your response. Choose calm over chaos, understanding over anger, and problem-solving over frustration.  
**How to Apply the 90/10 Principle:**  


* **Let it roll off:** Negative comments? Let them slide. Don't let someone else's negativity dictate your mood.
* **Traffic rage? Nah:** Someone cuts you off? Take a deep breath. It's not worth the stress or the risk.
* **Job loss? Time to pivot:** See setbacks as opportunities. Channel your energy into finding something better.
* **Delayed flight? Embrace the unexpected:** Use the extra time to read, relax, or connect with fellow passengers.

The 90/10 principle isn't about ignoring problems; it's about choosing how you respond to them. It's about taking control of your emotional reactions and building resilience. Try it – you might be surprised at how much calmer and happier your life becomes.

 Morbid curiosity, maybe. Or maybe I just wanted to see if she still looked the same.

She didn’t. Well, not exactly. Same eyes, same nervous way of tucking her hair behind her ear. But edo different, like the way she carried herself, and the uncertainty in her face

And then she said it.

""I lied. I still love you.""

Answer cheppaledu 

I laughed, short, bitter. ""So, your lie was worth more then than your love is worth now. Is that it?""

Her head snapped up, and for a moment, she looked like she was going to cry. The audacity. But she didn’t. Instead, she mumbles, ""Appudu Naku em cheyali ardhamkaledu. I thought it would be easier for both of us if I-""

""Cut me off completely?"" I interrupted. ""Ghosted me? Lied straight to my face and said you didn’t feel anything anymore? Yeah, that worked out great, didn’t it? Anni nee ishtame na?""

Her hands were shaking now, but I didn’t care. I was so angry I could barely see straight.

""I thought I was doing the right thing,"" she said softly

""Right thing? Evarki? Neeka? ""

She didn’t answer that either.

For a minute, neither of us said anything. I could feel all the things I wanted to say bubbling up inside me, but none of them felt worth saying. Not anymore.

""You know,"" I finally said, my voice quieter now, ""I would’ve forgiven you. Back then. honest ga nuvvu chepte, I would’ve understood. But ippudu? Now you think you can just drop this on me and what? Expect me to… what, to love you back?""

""I don’t expect anything,"" she whispered.

""Good,"" I said, pushing my chair back. ""Because I don’t have anything left to give you.""

I stood up, and for a second, aaputhadi anukunna. But she just sat there, staring at her coffee like it held the answers she’d been looking for.

I walked out without looking back.

But then, as soon as I stepped out, i had one question in my head, if she really did love me, what did that mean for me now?

It didn’t matter. Or at least, that’s what I told myself.

I've been through 4 years of high school, 4 years of university, multiple part time jobs, extra curricular clubs, I've been surrounded by women my age all the time but I've still never had a girlfriend. I've never asked anyone out, but I've also never been asked out. 

I get the onus is *generally* on men to initiate but come on, you can't tell me there wasn't ONE woman out of the dozens I've known throughout my life who couldn't even so much as ask me on a coffee date? Or of the thousands of women I've passed in public, not one thought I was cute enough to ask for my number? Maybe women do approach sometimes but only in social situations like bars and parties? (which I never go to lol)

I honestly find it really fascinating how something as important as relationships is predicated almost entirely on female passivity and male initiative. For most things in life, women and men have to put in equal amounts of effort, but for relationships, I guess women just don't have to really put in any effort, and can just passively exist instinctively knowing a man will eventually ask them out?

In the past I've had anxiety and PTSD-driven insomnia, the type with lots of hypervigilance and where my brain just won't shut up.

This has been different. For the past couple of years my sleep has been awesome thanks to getting my PTSD under control. But over the past couple of months I've had the combo of not being able to fall asleep, and then the classic 3:00 a.m. wake-up call and then unable to fall asleep again. I do all the things--cannabis, guided meditations, gi gong and regular exercise, hot baths, valerian tea, avoiding too much screen time, etc. but those things are making little difference. I know I'm screwed when even a hefty dose of THC doesn't do the trick. Unfortunately, neither OTC or prescription sleep meds did much in the past.

I've been curbing my coffee habit because I knew it was keeping me up at night if I had it past noon or so. Now I'm down to 1 cup of coffee in the morning. I notice I'm pretty jittery even from the one cup and my sciatic nerve in particular seems to get irritated.

Have I really become THAT hypersensitive to caffeine? I've quit caffeine before and it did not go well, but I think I may need to try again to see if it helps with the insomnia.

Following the recent trend of retrospective and informative posts, I'd like to share my experience developing a game with Flutter.

I've also written a detailed post about the first year of the game itself on our own subreddit, and [you can read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/s/t3geKMLSLN). 

I also linked an image showing some testimonials we've had from our players who gave their permission to use those.

If you want to check out the game itself, you can do so at https://walkscape.app

Let's dive in!

# The background

Before starting this project, I studied Computer Science at university and worked as an IT consultant. I've been creating my own hobbyist game projects since I was 10 years old, but before this, I hadn't released any of my other games to more than a couple dozen people. I'm from Finland, which matters when it comes to the ease of starting a business. Finland also has a fairly high cost of living, which mattered a lot when considering dropping everything else and pursuing this full time.

# Choosing Flutter

When I had this idea in my head for combining RuneScape-type progression with fitness to create another of my own hobby projects to help myself become healthier, I started out with Unity.

The first prototype I wanted to make had to include a basic UI and be able to pull the pedometer data while the game wasn't even in the background. This was a huge struggle with Unity. Native coding with Unity is a big hassle, and there was one package available from Unity Marketplace that was like $20 to achieve this. Not exactly a good start.

I managed to make a prototype, but the steps only counted when the game was open, and I figured out that creating a game that's mostly UI would be very slow. Also, even though the game was just a simple UI with a pedometer, it made my phone run hot and drained a ton of battery.

I started to research alternatives and found Flutter. This is actually my first Flutter project as well.

I managed to create the similar prototype with Flutter in a single evening with a much better UI, and there were several open source packages available **for free** to handle the native pedometer side for both iOS and Android. The app ran super well, didn't consume pretty much any battery, counted steps even from the background, and most importantly Flutter had great tooling for creating UIs quickly and it had hot reload that retained the state. Also, Flutter having its own rendering engine that I can tinker with as much as I like is what makes it the only viable option for the job when compared to things like React Native.

I can't underline enough how insane the hot reload is for game development. I can have my game running and add new features that **update live**? I was sold, especially when considering that saving code with Unity can sometimes take several minutes.

And best of all, I could do everything with just VSCode, and develop the game using software development kind of pipelines. Using something as simple as git with Unity can be very difficult, as even the default project template can be hundreds of megabytes.

# Starting a business

In 2023, I started posting about this project on Reddit, where it gained popularity. As people asked to financially support the development, I opened Buy Me a Coffee and Patreon accounts. We began with about $100 in monthly recurring revenue, which grew steadily.

Finnish regulations shaped how we handled this growth. Here, accepting donations is illegal without a police permit. However, if supporters receive something in return, it's considered a purchase rather than a donation. By giving Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee supporters special Discord roles and guaranteed access to the Closed Beta, it’s no longer considered donating.

At the time, Finland had a 10k€ tax-free earning limit before requiring company registration and VAT payments. By late summer 2023, we approached this threshold, making it logical to establish a company. This move had an added benefit—entrepreneurs qualify for an 800€ monthly social security payment for one year, regardless of income. This support made it feasible for me to pause my university studies, leave my job, and focus on the project full-time.

# Launching the Closed Beta

Our initial target for launching the game was in 2023, but as often happens in development, this proved unrealistic. After weeks of intense crunch, the game was ready for release on January 18, 2024. However, TestFlight and Google Play review processes delayed the launch until the 19th.

The launch was incredibly stressful. Though we only had 752 players eligible for the first wave of Closed Beta, it felt enormous at the time. Adding to the pressure, I was flying to London for a game convention the day after release.

Fortunately, the stress eased quickly. Despite some bugs and issues, the feedback from first-wave testers was overwhelmingly positive. We saw a surge in Patreon supporters seeking guaranteed access to the next wave, likely driven by word-of-mouth from our initial 752 players.

Here are some stats on how the game has grown:

- Wave 1 (Jan 19th 2024): 752 Closed Beta players, and 4,948 registered accounts.
- Wave 2 (Feb 28th 2024): 4,718 Closed Beta players, and 10,447 registered accounts.
- Wave 2.5 (Jun 1st 2024): 12,085 Closed Beta players, and 21,864 registered accounts.

While I'm not certain about typical user numbers for TestFlight and Google Play Closed Testing, reaching over 20k downloads without being listed on the app stores feels like a huge achievement.

We've built substantial infrastructure to support this scale, as Google Play Closed Testing and TestFlight weren't designed for such numbers. Our custom server (built with Dart!) monitors Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee supporters, while our website lets users link these accounts to their WalkScape profile. Once linked, they receive access along with instructions for downloading the game through TestFlight or Google Play.

# Retrospective: what I learned

I'd like to highlight key factors that have contributed to our success:

- Transparency and communication with the community.

Long before launching the Closed Beta, I began writing development blogs on Reddit every two weeks—a practice we maintain to this day. I’m prioritizing honesty and transparency in these blogs about our progress, and we respond to questions and feedback as often as possible. This approach has earned us trust within the community. You can read the devblogs at r/WalkScape

- Setting standards & sticking to them.

In our very first subreddit post, I outlined core promises for the game: no predatory monetization (E.g. in-app purchases), no ads, transparency, and a focus on community-driven development. We're sticking to these principles.

- Ease of marketing.

During release waves, I share updates in relevant subreddits. The game has also benefited from strong word-of-mouth marketing, with players regularly sharing it with friends and family.

And here are some key lessons I've learned:

- Running a business involves much more than development.

With games especially, you must wear many hats: customer support, server technology, marketing, legal, accounting, government bureaucracy, and HR. These responsibilities consume significant time, particularly when launching your first business and learning the ropes.

- Mistakes happen, and admitting them is good.

I've made mistakes—but we're communicating those openly to our community. Sometimes you can't prevent mistakes: my biggest setback was spending two months creating pedometer solutions for Android devices, only to have Google release their Recording API, which solved everything overnight. That work became obsolete, but it's part of the journey.

- Scaling from a personal hobby project to an MMORPG with thousands of players is challenging.

This being my first Flutter project and first MMORPG makes it an ambitious undertaking, particularly as I started it as a solo developer.

Had I known the scale our systems would need to reach, I might have made different choices initially. However, many aspects were impossible to anticipate, and it's often better to build something first and improve it later.

I've written about how I recently overhauled our game engine by making it multi-threaded, separating logic into its own package, and making it stateless. [You can read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/1gh4hqi/how_i_optimized_my_flutter_game_engine_load_times/) I wish I would’ve done that from the start.

# Going forward

This year, our plan is to get the game to a state where we can release it for open beta so anyone can download it.

Flutter-wise, I'm also committed in trying to benefit the community and ecosystem as much as possible. I've already had the pleasure of talking with Google and Very Good Ventures, and as a business, we want to help their [Flutter Commercial Roadmap](https://github.com/VGVentures/flutter-commercial-roadmap) in order to do what we can for the ecosystem to grow. We're lucky to have this kind of project on our hands, and it can help to raise awarness of Flutter in the game dev community.

From Flutter, I'm always looking forward to more game development related features and support. Impeller has been a great development, and I'm waiting to get my hands on production ready Flutter GPU & 3D support. Those features in my opinion will elevate Flutter to the next level when it comes to game development.

# Extra bits

There's so much more I could share, but this post is already quite lengthy. Please feel free to ask any questions—I'll do my best to answer them!

Here are some interesting additional insights:

- Early on, I received a life-changing acquisition offer from another company. I declined, and I'm confident it was the right decision. This project has never been about making quick money—I'm genuinely content with my life as it is.
- Jagex's legal team approached us and offered a license agreement allowing us to use their IP in our marketing, which was an incredibly fortunate development.
- Hiring game developers differs significantly from hiring software developers. While technical skills matter, passion for game development is crucial. Many applicants had strong technical backgrounds, but without demonstrated interest in game development, they weren't the right fit.
- Despite our $14k MRR, we're barely breaking even. Our first year brought in 62k€ total revenue with 2k€ profit. With four team members, a Helsinki office, multiple servers, internal services, accounting fees, taxes, and mandatory pension payments, our expenses are substantial.
- Conventions are vital in the game development industry. Finland's game industry is small—just 4,100 people—and the global industry, while compact, is well-connected. I strongly recommend attending conventions to build your network. It's been invaluable for me. Many countries have game developer organizations that arrange networking events and coordinate group trips to international conventions, helping share costs.

# Closing words

I hope this wasn't too long of a write-up, and maybe some of you found it interesting!

As mentioned, I'll try to answer any questions with as much detail as possible that people might have. I hope that sharing my experience and what I've learned helps other people find success and learn about game development with Flutter, benefiting the ecosystem for us all.

43.	



The first day with Willa, now officially the household maid starts off rather well. Sadly, like a footballer who scores a wonderful goal and is then injured, or a maid who has prepared a wonderful meal only to remember the chicken is in the oven when the smoke detector goes off, trauma lies ahead.

The wonderful part for Willa, formerly William, was waking up to find Avery, his wife, and now his Mistress, busy cuffing his wrists to the steel barred headboard. 

“Nice, sleep, maid?”

Her blonde hair is a mess around her pretty face. No doubt after all the screwing  which she and her Bull had been carrying out in the master bedroom.

“Oh, yeh,” Willa says, barely awake, finding the words difficult. “And you Mistress?”

She pulls the blue ropes from the bottom drawer and smiles at her cuffed former husband, who is now the maid Willa.

“Oh my, he was a brute last night. I think he really gets off being the man of the house. Wow.”

As the bonds are tightened about his stockinged ankles, William feels that familiar lump of shame in his tummy. He should be man of the house! 

As she tightens the last knot, pulling his legs nicely apart, she says, “Oh don’t look like that. This is what you’ve always wanted. Shall I ask your Master to give you a spanking with the belt before you start work?”

“Oh, no, Mistress. No. I hate the belt. Oh, and the cane, oh and …”

She laughs and kisses his nose to stop the prattling, “Relax. We need to get your spiked chastity cage on. You know what Sir is like. Everything has to go the way he commands!”

She rolls her eyes before smiling mischievously.

“But mistress! I hate the spiked cage too!”

She pulls the blindfold around his head. "" Make sure you brush your hair before going down, as I have instructed before. You look so much better after your hair has been sorted.”

Bound and in the darkness of the blindfold, Willa sighs. It all feels so unfair. 

As his wife removes the old chastity cage and cleans his groin, she runs a fingertip around his freshly shaved landing strip. It is so pretty and is just as ordered by her Bull.

“The wax strips worked brilliantly, but I’m thinking of you being lasered all over. Only takes a few hours. And these days the laser has coolers, so it doesn’t hurt as much as when I had my legs done all those years ago.”

He is about to complain when he feels the cold steel of the spiked chastity cage being pushed onto his shrinking member.

“Oh!”

“Now don’t worry, maid. Your master says in a few more days your little dicky will stay limp.” She giggles. “And Master says it will return to normal once you are out of chastity for a while.”

“Oh, is Master going to let me out of chastity soon?”

The blindfold is slid off.

“Now, I didn’t say that, maid. Did I?”

He looks so sorrowful that she giggles and kisses his nose. 

“Silly maid. You wanted this and you’ve got it. Oh. This will cheer you up. I want you to wear these.”

She pulls open his panty drawer and holds up a bubble-gum pink pair of frilly panties. William has never seen so many frills!

“I bet he’ll love to see you in those for your maintenance spanking before we leave.”

She drops the panties on the bed and undoes the ropes.

“Mistress, I’m sure the girls know I am wearing them, sometimes. I feel they are obvious through my maid’s skirt.”

“Well they don’t! You are being silly again.”

Once the cuffs are off he stands, and his Mistress embraces her wonderful maid.

“I do love my maid.”

She kisses his cheek and skips back to the bedroom on her bare feet. 

He sits on the bed, feeling alone, knowing full well why she has raced back to be with her bully of a Bull. The jealousy burns in his tummy. Marvin will be screwing Willa’s wife, a thought that makes him feel physically sick.

All through his shower, he wonders how to bring this nightmare to an end. It is fun and exciting, for sure, but it is all going too far.

He has fully dressed as a maid, and is brushing his hair, listening to the light tingle of the bells on his maid’s collar, while he muses how to approach Marvin. Sometimes the bully can be so approachable, then, at other times, he can be so terrifying! Willa’s hands go around to his bottom, which is always sexily warm from a previous spanking.

His PC pings. 

A message!

He hasn’t had many of those since he sold off the company.

He slides onto his chair, being careful to press down the back of the skirt as he does so. He has learnt that a skirt can easily crease if he is too careless when settling onto a chair.

Oh my God!

Master has already added Willa, Bailey Thane to his Outlook email program. She has her own Willa email address! WillaBailyThane@gmail.com.

Like wow! 

It already has five messages. The first two are from Microsoft about setting up the email account.

His pink lipsticked lips hang open as he sees there are two more, one from His Majesty’s Deed  Poll Office, London!

He opens it, finding his breathing has grown shallow.

Oh my!

There it is. His old name in small font, but his new name in a large font across the middle of the page. Willa, Bailey Thane. There are instructions on changing his driving licence, passport, and a list of companies that needs to be notified.

There is even a warning that using his old name is illegal, just as Avery’s kick arse, lawyer sister had said.

He finds he has to sit back and draw breath.

Oh my!

The second email is from his bank, confirming Willa’s new bank account, saying that he will receive in the post a credit card and login details. 

The third email is from Nicole Bailey, Corporate Solicitor, and is called ‘Formal Domestic Service Contract’.

His lips round into a pretty ‘O’ shape as he opens the email and sees the contract he has signed.

He scrolls through it, paragraph by paragraph. It is heart stopping.

It contains a long, carefully worded list of his duties under Mr Marvin Thane, CEO and the managing director, Avery Thane.

He feels anger at his wife changing her surname to that of the Bull as if the Bull has stolen something from him. Yet he feels his dick push up to the spikes in the cage. He is angry and helpless. That makes him mindlessly aroused.

Oh my, the duties!

He is breathlessly aware of his garb and his position in the household, along with the positions of his wife and her Bull. He needs to wank. And he needs to wank badly. 

He pulls open the top drawer and sees his Master’s vibrator.

Can he use it? Master said he could play with it last night, so he hasn’t said he couldn’t continue playing with it this morning. 

Lust makes him grab the smooth object and return to the screen, kissing it gently with his pink lips.

He is reading the section about having to wear the employer’s uniform at all times.

At that, he groans and sucks in the vibrator past his lips tasting its plastic. 

Oh, my, my, my, there is an entire section on maintaining his appearance at all times.

His brain, made dumb by desire, is barely thinking as he reaches for the lube and smears it over the dildo. He can hear his Master’s word’s:

“Always lube the vibrator well as you mustn’t damage that arse I now own.”

For fuck’s sake.

He needs it inside him. And he needs it inside him right now. 

As he pokes the well smeared dildo gently into his anus, his eyes fall on the section, “guests and visitors”. It states, he must be attentive to all their needs and instructions. Oh wow, yes.

He is riding the dildo as he sees a section on Mr Thane’s employees, who must be obeyed. 

With half closed eyes he pauses. Mr Thane’s employers?

He reads the employee’s list.

Obviously, Avery Thane is first, then comes the terrifying sister, Nicola Bailey. Oh for fuck’s sake. To have to obey someone he hates! But why is that so arousing? He is now half concentrating on keeping his dick limp to avoid the pain of the spikes.

Jesus! The final two employees are Amy and Heather Thane. William’s own six year old twins now with Willa’s Master’s surname. He has to obey them and be attentive to their every need, or, it reads, ‘face the consequences of inept performance.’

His head rolls back, and he is gasping and squealing, ‘Yes, oh yes’, as the vibrator presses over his prostate ‘G Spot’ in his rectum. 

His entire body erupts in orgasm, but just like the cheapest slut on heat, his cumming doesn’t give relief so he is forced to continue. 

The pleasure being in the endless, mindless arousal.

“Oh God, yes, yes!”

“Maid?” A voice from miles away.

Then a harsher, Maid! What do you think you are doing?”

Like a rocket thumping back to  the planet Earth, he returns to his room.

It is a while before the fuzzy brain of the maid can make out what is happening.

Avery is standing in the doorway. Her face is a picture of shock and disgust.

He is mumbling ‘sorry’, but can’t stand up on his heels because his stockinged legs are too shaky.

“Mistress, I … I …”

“Where the fuck should you be?”

“Eh?” He barely knows where he is let alone where he should be. 

How come his wife swears at him now?

“Sorry, Mistress, I , I …”

Her voice is hard, “The girls are downstairs waiting for their breakfast! They came up to interrupt your Master and me when we were …well never mind what we were doing. Your Master is furious with you!”

Like a drunk having a bucket of icy water thrown in their face, the maid’s brain is coming back into sync with the real world.

He stands on his shaky heels.

“Oh my. Sorry, Mistress, I forgot the time. I was checking the contract from Miss Nicole and …”

He is stopped by his wife, crossing her arms and raising her eyebrows.

Then, Willa remembers he is gripping the greased vibrator in his hand. He stares at it as if he has never seen it before and feels close to tears. 

“Oh, Mistress, I am so sorry, I really am. I just …”

“You’ll be sorrier when your Master hears, I tell you, young lady. Now get your arse downstairs and sort out the girl's breakfast, and get ours ready!”

He puts the vibrator in the ensuite, ready for cleaning later when he has the house to himself.

“Yes, Mistress, of course, Mistress.”

As he passes her in the doorway, she says, “Wait.”

He is now in complete desperate shock. “Yes, Mistress?”

“Your maid cap!”

In a mindless panic he darts back to get it from the wardrobe, the bells around his neck tingling.

“Oh yes, of course. Yes.”

Avery is genuinely furious with her maid. Sitting here pleasuring herself when she should be on maid duty with her kids. How incompetent is Avery going to look in the eyes of her Bull if she cannot control her own maid?

She needs to hurt him and knows the words that will do exactly that.

“Maid,” she speaks coldly and evenly, “Your Master is going to punish you so bad you will never, never forget it!”

His eyes grow huge in his carefully made up face. His false eye lashes flicker, and his pink lips fall open showing his white teeth.

She has struck home.  At one time, she would have felt pity on anyone looking that terrified, but right now, she experiences the Mistress satisfaction of job well done.

“Well get downstairs, maid. You have breakfast to sort!”

















44.	





With time pressing, Willa has barely time to brush his hair in the hallway mirror before clip clopping into the kitchen on her heels as fast as he can. Heels only permit a sort of sexy trot at best.

An annoyed Amy and Heather sit before an empty table. An irritating pop music channel plays from the smart speaker, something Willa, when William their father, forbade. He hates pop music but his views no longer matter in the family home

Amy, as ever the most forward, says, “Where’s our breakfast, maid?”

“Sorry, Miss Amy. Sorry Miss Heather. I was held up.”

Even in his frantic state, Willa finds it difficult to accept how his children now address him with such a surly tone. Amy’s attitude is reprehensible, and when he was father in the house, he would have admonished her for her rudeness. One day, when he has his rightful position back, he would ensure his children were polite, even to menial staff like the maid.

He takes out their Hoola cereal packet from the cupboard and finds two dishes. His mind is still fogged up from his fear of what Marvin, his Master, will say and do when he finds out how naughty Willa has been.

Heather huffs, “And we should have orange juice!”

“Yes of course, Miss Heather, right away, Miss Heather.”

He cuts sufficient bread for the girls, his wife, and her lover, toasting the pieces four at a time.

Oh my God! He has just seen the coffee machine is still off!

Master always demands a cup of coffee in the morning.

For those who only ever fantasise about being a cute maid in a household, the truth is far removed from wearing sexy outfits and being pleasantly obedient. Once the maid’s carefully rehearsed itinerary is knocked, for whatever reason, then everything falls apart.

Once the coffee machine is going, he starts grilling the bacon for Master’s breakfast.

Though his brain swirls like juice in a blender, he hopes to get up to speed, and back on course. 

Until …

Avery is standing in the doorway, neatly dressed in one of her short bright dresses, with a pursed exasperated expression. In her arms is a becalmed baby, Amos, looking, quietly bewildered.

Oh no!

Avery says, “You forget something. Or should I say, someone?”

At that point, poor Willa’s mental capacities are flushed away with fearful remorse.

He collects himself sufficiently to scurry over and take the baby from the arms of its mother. He places Amos in the baby chair, and rushes to get the bottle and porridge ready for him.

At this point, Willa is close to tears. How could she have been so stupid?

Willa’s voice is actually shaking as she asks, “Mistress, your usual toast and coffee?”

Avery takes her seat at the small table near the patio doors, where she and her lover have their breakfasts, away from the kids.

She raises her eyebrows in a ‘what do you think’ glare before shaking her head with exasperation.

Checking the clock, Willa sees it is already eight o’clock. It will be three quarters of an hour before they are out of the house, and he can flop down on the sofa in the sitting room to just get back his wits.

Master arrives to squeals of delight from the children.

“Daddy!”

They leap from the table and hug the man they now see as their father.

When he sees what he has given away the pain Willa feels in his tummy is immense.

It is while Master eats his egg, bacon and toast, while checking through his work schedule on his tablet, that Amy turns in her chair to look at the loving couple on the other table.

“Daddy?”

She asks sweetly in a way that shreds at Willa’s insides.

Marvin doesn’t look up from his screen, “Yeh sweet stuff?”

“Daddy,” she pauses, screwing up her face in thought. “Daddy, the maid has been naughty this morning.”

Nodding, Marvin says, “More than you know.”

“Are you going to … well, you said you spank the maid when she is very naughty.”

Closing his eyes, feeling the false eyelashes flap, Willa groans inwardly with humiliation. His own child discussing with his Master how he is punished with a spanking when naughty.

Putting down his cutlery, Marvin takes in his two daughters staring at him with adoration.

“The maid has been very naughty this morning. I will deal with her before we leave.”

Deal with her? Now Willa feels completely sick. It will not be the daily maintenance spanking with the paddle. That much he knows!

Heather uses her eyes to indicate her sister should ask more. It is as if they have been quietly discussing something while Willa has been engrossed in feeding Amos.

Amy lifts up her chin, “Can me and Heather watch?”

What?

Willa drops Amos’ spoon with a clatter on the plastic baby table fixed to the high chair.

Avery’s eyes widen as if wanting to take in every bit of her lover’s response.

It is a while before Marvin says, “No. I can’t allow that. But,” his wicked eyes take in the terrified maid, revelling in her discomfort before her own family, “but I guess you can listen.”

Listen? No!

Willa presses her palms against her apron, staring at his wife to rescue him.

But his wife merely nods and then resumes eating her toast as if it is another day in their lives.

Marvin stands, his size giving him a physical force in the kitchen.

The maid finishes feeding the toddler and wipes his mouth before standing to attention to wait for his Master’s instructions.

“Maid,” Marvin says, relishing his power and authority in the household he now rules, “I cannot let it pass how incompetent and naughty you have been this morning. Now, be a good girl and run and fetch your cane. Then stand in the hallway.”

Despite his limbs feeling stiff, Willa moves, wide eyed to fetch the cane from the coat cupboard in the hallway. By keepings his shocked eyes on the floor he doesn’t have to see his wife or children’s reaction to him being sent for his punishment implement.

As he stands near the staircase, he can see Amy and Heather staring at him. Willa quickly looks away, catching his breath.

Marvin rises and says said, “Kids. You need to know that when a maid is punished well, she will yell and call out. She will eventually cry. There is no need to be alarmed. This is perfectly normal.”

Perfectly normal! If Willa wasn’t holding the cane and expecting a dreadful beating, he would have spoken up immediately.

The Bull continues, “It is only when the maid is crying that we know she has fully learnt her lesson.”

Amy and Heather nod, but their flickering eyes indicate they do not fully understand.

“Right, maid,” Marvin points to a place near the kitchen door but out of sight to anyone in the kitchen. “Quickly girl!”

Willa physically jumps at his Master’s instruction before hearing his heels machine gun the wooden floor of the hall as he marches into the position.

“M-m-Master, if I may say …”

“Bend over, girl. We’ve all heard enough from you, for one day!”

“Yes, Master,” Willa bends over until his fingers touch his ankles. With a little more effort he can touch the shoe straps of his high heels.

Avery’s stockinged feet appear before him. He can make out the light red nail varnish.

She has come to rescue him!

As his blonde curls fall around his cheeks, he smiles. His wife will explain why it is a monstrous idea to punish him within earshot of his children.

He feels his skirt raised at the back. That puff of cooling air that a maid experiences when her skirt is pulled up over her bent waist.

Avery needs to speak quickly!

Willa runs his eyes up his Mistress’ gorgeous legs until he sees his wife is staring at her lover with mouth open admiration. 

“Nice panties,” Marvin grunts a laugh. “All those ruffles!”

Avery tries to laugh, but she does so with wheezing, as if she struggles for breath as she watches her lover take full control of her sissy, maid husband.

Taking in a lungful of air, Avery says, “I like them too. The bubble-gum pink pair of frilly panties with all those ruffles looks wonderful on her. Thought you’d like them.”

The panties that so impress the Bull are suddenly tugged downwards.

Oh no! 

Willa’s mind freezes. 

This cannot be happening.

The panties catch in the garter buckles of his stockings, but Marvin jerks them free before sliding them over the stockings until they rest near his knees, binding his legs together.

His bottom is bare.

Unless Avery speaks up soon, he will be caned by his wife’s lover, and his children will hear him squeal!

Taking a step back, Marvin pats the cruel rattan cane against the already pink hued cheeks. 

“Maid,” Marvin announces, “You will remain in position until I have finished your correction. Clear?”

“Yes, yes, Master, but …”

The cane slaps a few times against the exposed buttocks, and it is sufficient for Willa to know that he should shut up.

Suddenly, the raucous radio in the kitchen is turned off.

The kids must have silenced the inane pop music to hear the chastisement of their father better.

Without the insipid noise the house feels silent, full of trepidation.

The taps against the maid’s bared bottom continue until there is a pause.

The thwack is like a lightning bolt.

It is on the crest of Willa’s arse and is such a shock that he cries out, stepping forward to find his panties holding his knees together.

He mustn’t make a sound. He doesn’t want the kids to hear him yelp when being beaten.

Somehow that gives him a strength, a sort of reassurance, it offers him some notion of control in the situation. He will bravely take his punishment in silence.

The second strike is in the same place making Willa grunt through closed lips.

But then the spanks start in earnest. 

Marvin is an old hand at caning dumb cucks and leathers the unprotected backside from bottom to top. He then slices the cane against the arse in a downwards pattern.

The pain is dreadful. Willa knows that the paddle and a hand spanking are quite good fun, even allowing for the tummy gnawing humiliation, but the belt and cane are fierce implements of reprimand.

His tight lipped grunts give way to squeals … then to gasps … then to shouts.

Now he is shrieking, “No. Please.  No, Master. No. Please.”

But the cane is now flicking at his thighs, causing a series of angry welts to line up, above his stocking tops.

It must end. He cannot take it!

“Oh please, Master. Please. I am so, sorry!”

Avery nibbles her lip. On the one hand, watching the alpha male lay down his authority against her sissy hubbie is deeply arousing. On the other hand, Willa is now her maid, and she is responsible for her servant.

The cane strikes the underhang of the buttocks with a loud slap.

It must end! Willa howls out loud; the dam bursts, and tears stream from his eyes while snot runs out of his nose.

He hears his Mistress, Avery, say, “Sir,” in a tentative, questioning voice. 

The beating pauses.

A distressed and helpless maid looks up at his Mistress, the only person who can save him from further pain.

Avery speaks quietly, “Perhaps my maid,” she emphasises ‘my maid’, “Has learnt a valuable lesson.”

“Really?” Marvin sounds genuinely surprised. He barks, “Stand up straight, maid!”

Willa does so, her back and legs aching after the stress position.

“Yes,” he splutters a cough and tears, “Master.”

“The Mistress of the house thinks the maid has learnt her lesson.”

It is a moment before the distressed maid realises that Marvin is speaking to him. “Yes, Master.”

It is so difficult to speak when his arse is on fire, and he so desperately wants to wipe away the tears and snot from his lightly made-up face.

“Maid,” the Bull says. “Have you learnt a lesson?”

For a Bull, there is a wonderous quality about taking a dumb cuck to this position where he has been punished and knows that the punishment can continue. Understanding fully that the cuck understands the decisions in the household are no longer his but only those of the Bull.

Catching hold of his apron and feeling his frilly panties tighten around his knees as he faces his Master, Willa sniffs, “Oh, yes, Master. I promise I have. Really.”

The flesh of Willa’s backside is scorching. As he sniffles up his tears and snot, he longs to put a cold cloth over it. He wiggles a little, but it does not alleviate the pain.

“Right, little maid,” Marvin says, relishing his power in the home, “pull up your panties and return to your chores.”

Closing his eyes, Willa is genuinely grateful his punishment is over. 

“Yes, Master, thank you, Master.”

He is about to thank his Mistress when he sees that her hooded eyes are fixed on the powerful alpha male of the house. Her tongue touches her lower lip in sharp stabs. Has his wife ever looked at Willa with such lust? Even when he was the man of the house and her husband?”

The pain in his arse is now reflected in the pain he feels in his tummy. A pain of loss and regret.

A subdued Willa returns to feeding Amos, without even catching the eyes of his daughters who sit still, silently watching the chastised maid wipe her tears away with the backs of her hands.

As a sniffling maid raises the spoon to feed Amos, he feels at least his kids must be feeling deep sympathy for him having heard him beaten like that.

He is mistaken.

As soon as a hugging, kissing, Avery and Marvin return to their seats around the smaller table, Amy takes in a deep breath.

“Daddy. Has the maid learnt her lesson?”

There is a chuckle in Marvin’s voice as he says, “I dunno. Let’s ask her. Maid?”

Willa feels himself stand to attention. “Yes, Master?”

“The girls want to know if you have learnt your lesson.”

He swallows, gripping his apron. “Oh, yes, Master, thank you, Master.”

With a nod of the head towards the twins, Marvin says, “Well tell the girls then.”

Oh God. No. Please.

Feeling his mouth go dry, Willa turns to face his children.

“Please, Miss Amy, Miss Heather, yes I have learned my lesson. Thank you for asking.”

Heather wrinkles her nose in that cute manner of youngsters when they are unsure, “So will you be naughty again, maid?”

“Oh!” Willa finds it difficult to swallow as her entire mouth and throat are now dry. “Oh no, Miss Heather. I will try to be well behaved.”

Heather turns to the man she now sees as her father. “Daddy, can the maid have a smiley face sticker?”

Marvin smiles, indulging the little girl, “Why, Heather? You must always have a reason to give the maid a sticker.”

Heather loses confidence. “I don’t know. I suppose, I mean, well …”

She is lost, and Marvin steps in to help her. “Because the maid has promised to behave?”

Heather grabs the answer to her conundrum with enthusiasm. “Yes, daddy. I want the maid to have two stickers.”

Marvin turns his bulk around to face her completely.

“Well girls, that is up to you. Just as it is important for me to punish the maid when she has been naughty, so it is helpful to her to be rewarded when she has been good.”

Willa’s jaw falls open at the humiliation of his own children being involved in his stick and carrot punishment-rewards system.

He wants to flee to his bedroom, throw himself onto his bed and bury his head in the pillow. 

As his tummy grips itself in knots and his dick shrinks even more in his spiked chastity cage, he feels true degradation. This is not a fantasy of erotic embarrassment. This is truly being demoted in a way over which he is powerless.

Sitting up straight to acquire the courage to speak, Heather says, “Maid, you can put two smiley stickers on your chart!”

Willa looks at the Bull for guidance in how he should react.

Marvin nods, “Thank Heather, maid, and do as you are told. Add the smiley stickers to your behaviour chart.”

Swallowing, Willa say, “Yes, Master. Thank you, Miss Heather.”

It feels as if the eyes of the world are upon him as he crouches before the fridge and adds two smiley stickers to his chart. He sees that each of the girls has six and will probably have more by the end of the day. Then they will get a treat, such as ice cream.

Willa wonders if he achieves ten stickers whether his Master will unlock him and let him play with himself.

He rises back on his heels and waits for a moment to see if there are further instructions before trying to feed Amos.

“Sir?” Avery croaks.

“Yeh?” Marvin asks.

“Sir,” Avery’s face is flushed pink, her breathing quick. “May we return home as soon as we drop off the kids at school?”

Marvin grunts the ugly laugh Willa so detests.

“Yeh. Good idea. See if we can find something to do, eh?”

Now Willa is furious. 

The brute has caned him in earshot of his own children, and now his wife is just giving up her body to him.

Still, if they were returning later that morning, then it will give him time to explain to Marvin and Avery that he had had enough of this silliness.

A determined thought only marred by the fact that his little dick is suddenly inflating against the spikes in the cage. His dreamy mind is now full of images of his wife being taken by a real man while Willa watches obediently in his maid’s uniform.

1i501xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1i501xh/ive_been_fired_for_one_month_these_are_things_i/,I've been FIRE'd for one month; these are things I use most,"We spend our working lives accumulating money and stuff. As FIRE folk, we focus on the money situation, but I've noticed in the last month of early retirement that in terms of ""stuff,"" there are just a handful of things I use over-and-over that disproportionately improve my quality of life. So here they are...

Cappuccino maker and milk frother: I bought a $150 Nespresso machine that takes coffee pods. I buy the store brand pods from Target, which end up being about 60 cents per coffee. I make 3-4 espressos per day, and haven't spent a penny at Starbucks since I quit working.

SodaStream: Pop has always been my beverage of choice. I spent $100 on a SodaStream Art machine to replace store-bought pop. This is great for two reasons. First, it keeps me from having to lug 12-packs of pop home from the grocery store. Second, it saves money...I have to spend $16 every \~5 weeks to replace the CO2 canister, plus $6 per bottle of flavor concentrate a couple times per week. Best of all, I have pop on demand, which pleases me.

Library card: Before I quit my job, I went to my library and got a card. This gives me access to a ton of digital content, most importantly audiobooks. I've ""read"" more books in the last month than I had read in the previous three years. I'm discovering a love for books I didn't know I had before. I already pay for Spotify, so that gives me 15 hours of free audiobooks every month. My library (through an app called Hoopla) gives me seven free audiobooks every month. That's about nine free books per month total, and I either buy more listening time on Spotify or buy the book directly if I need more than that. This has been a game-changer for me in terms of entertainment. I devour books now and love it.

Ear buds: Because I listen to audiobooks all the time now, I bought a cheap pair ($30) of noise-cancelling wireless ear buds. I use these things all the time.

Home gym: This can mean something different to everyone, but I set up a nice home gym in my basement over the years. This includes free weights, a rowing machine, a pull up station, a yoga mat, a GHD machine, and a TV. The TV is important because it lets me build a workout routine using free YouTube fitness channels. I've always been good about working out, but now it's a part of every single morning for me. I've spend several thousand dollars on my gym equipment over the years, but you could always start by spending a few hundred dollars on some dumbbells, push-up bars, a yoga mat, and a pull-up bar.

Fitbit: Similar to the home gym, I'm requiring that I take at least 10,000 steps per day in retirement. So near the end of the day, if it looks like I'm falling short, I get outside and go for a walk. No excuses to fall short on steps. I got the cheapest one available--a Fitbit Inspire 2 for about $80.

Smart scale: I upgraded our scale to help keep track of key health metrics (weight, body fat percent, and on and on). My new scale cost $35 and does way more than my old smart scale that probably cost me four times as much. I step on the scale every morning and it updates an app on my phone. This is a great tool to monitor the results of using the Fitbit and the home gym.

Cordless vacuum: I'm doing most of the cleaning these days, and one of the first things I noticed was how big of a PITA it is to vacuum all the floors when you've got to constantly work around the cord and change outlets. So I splurged and bought a $270 Hoover ONEPWR cordless vacuum. Makes a huge difference in doing the regular floor cleaning (I still do deep cleans periodically with the corded vacuum and the steam cleaner).

  
So these are really basic consumer items that have made my life way better, despite their relatively low costs. If I'm expanding to high-end purchases, I'd say having a car you love to drive is also a high-value item in terms of post-retirement happiness. I'm sure I'll think of more as soon as I post this, but these jump to mind because I really like them a lot. Of course, finances and retiring to a passion are still the most important things to think about pre-FIRE. But honestly I find that having these basic comfort/convenience objects save me money and keep me happy in between the bigger moments (travel, volunteer work, side gig, etc).

This morning the machine worked fine and it made 4 coffees, but in the afternoon a family member wanted to make coffee and the machine upon turning on just made low grumbling noises and has been doing so since.

I have taken out the water filter, washed the brewing unit, checked if lube is okay ( I regularly reapplied) and even made sure the coffee grind opening is not clogged up (as per manual). 

Now I have no idea what else could be wrong. The O rings look fine to me. 

  
The machine is out of warranty as it's 2.5 years old so service is going to charge me and I'd like to try and fix it on my own if it's something small going on. 



I hope the machine isn't dead because that's a bit lousy for a 300€ coffee maker.

**Lies And Tastes** 

*Written by Drunken Dreamer (醉夢者)* 

*Translated by CasualNooby* 

*Posted on 2024/04/09* 

*Translated between 2025/01/16 - 2025/01/19* 

 

 

 

**Writer’s Foreword – 2024/04/09** 

It could be said as the first part. But my affection for Haruna was too high, so it was hard for me to even control how I wrote. 

This personally led me to feel that I wrote this so badly, but actually, all parts were equally as bad, so I still posted them out, just watch it at your discretion... 

Because of all kinds of factors, I’m not sure if I would be writing a new part. 

Of course, my love for her didn’t fade, it’s just that my inspirations were almost dried up. 

All name translations refer to the Global version. 

 

 

 

**Translator's Foreword – 2025/01/16** 

(2025/01/19 - Since this is still a work of translation, I’m posting it in the Blueprint flair and not the ON FIRE flair.) 

I wasn’t capable of cooking yet, so please enjoy this translated dish again. (Source from Drunken Dreamer) 

We’re peeking into Drunken Dreamer Sensei’s admiration of Kurodate Haruna throughout his 16 writings about her. 

You can expect better readability in this series compared to Sensei’s Handbook, another project that I was working translating on since the writer of this series is a former writer. 

(I have to use < > instead of ( ) in footnotes since Reddit wasn’t too friendly with formatting when there are brackets in superscript.) 

(Nineteen empty lines were purposefully left following this sentence to separate the miscellaneous and main content to make the formatting nicer.) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was already noon. Haruna and I were sitting on a bench at the amusement park. 

“Here, Sensei.” 

She gave the half-drunk bubble tea^(1) to me and grabbed the taiyaki^(2)\-shaped pillow in my hands. 

*^(1 – A tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s and was brought to the United States in the 1990s by Taiwanese immigrants. It most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca <starch extracted from the tubers of the cassava plant> balls, grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, popping boba, etc.)*  

*^(2 – A Japanese fish-shaped cake commonly sold as street food, named after the shape of tai <red sea bream>. The most common filling is red bean taste which is made from sweetened adzuki beans <red bean>, with other common fillings like custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato.)* 

“Thank you, Haruna.” 

At the invitation of Haruna, I came to the amusement park for a gourmet tour today. 

She said that besides providing the public with fun, amusement parks are also the battlefield for all kinds of stall vendors. Although the huge flow of people brought by amusement parks brought benefits to stall vendors, they’ll also have to increase the prices due to the expensive rent, and must also take into account the consumer psychology of the masses. 

Under various external factors, what kind of tastes can you taste? It’s something worthy of exploring, perhaps there could be a chance to taste the ultimate taste. 

However, half a day has passed, and we have already tried a lot of stall vendors, and found that to cope with the expensive rent, every stall owner chose the easiest way, which was reducing the quality and raising the price. 

Despite this, Haruna didn’t take any retributing actions and was in an unusually good mood instead. 

“Because today’s the first time of dating with Sensei!” She once said it excitedly. 

I didn’t refute the word “dating”. I just simply thought that I had to support students, so I accepted her invitation, still sticking with the line between teacher and student in my heart. 

Unlike in the past when she went out alone, today she has especially carefully dressed herself up for the “date” spoken by her. 

V-neckline white T-shirt, dark blue jeans with a belt, light-off white jacket draped over her body, and a medium-sized crossbody bag with its shoulder straps through the twin peaks, showcasing her enviable curves and proud peaks. 

Light make-up on her face, silver long hair tied in a side low ponytail, and the ends of her hair tied in braids draped over her shoulder, showing a mature atmosphere that’s different from the usual youth atmosphere. 

Just from her appearance alone, any man standing beside her will be flooded with envy eyesight from the masses. 

Even I was accidentally fascinated staring... 

“Hmm \~ It’s indeed different.” 

I took a sip of bubble tea. The chilly pleasure slightly eliminated the summer heat, but the sweetness was too high and a little greasy. I remembered that it was ordered in half-sugar? 

Although Haruna has a big appetite^(3), she doesn’t each much. She once said that she was frustrated because of this, so today we just used the method of ordering a meal and sharing it between us two. At first, we were too shy to eat because of the indirect kissing. 

*^(3 – <<Translator’s Note>> This should be in comparison with the other Gourmet Research Society members.)* 

Carefully chewing the tapioca balls, it feels a little soft. Shouldn’t the tapioca balls be tender and chewy? 

And now I’m just naturally thinking about the taste of food. Habit truly is a horrifying thing. 

“I knew it.” 

According to Haruna, the stall owner specializes in hand-fried brown sugar. But in fact, it was reduced brown sugar re-made by jaggery^(4), which was flavored not only with molasses but also added with caramel pigment. 

*^(4 – A traditional non-centrifugal cane sugar <NCS, technical name given to raw sugar>.)* 

Not only was its cost low, but its taste was also difficult for people to distinguish. If it isn’t that I have tried shops she has recommended, I wouldn’t been able to tell it either. 

For topics about food, things said by this Gourmet Research Society’s president are impossible to get wrong, which I can use my identity as Sensei to promise. 

“I just felt a little disappointed that we didn’t find any satisfactory food today.” 

Haruna’s hands leaned on the pillow, picking up the amusement park’s guidebook, crossing out the vendors they have tried today with a red pen, and carefully checking if there were any ones they missed. 

“It’s alright \~ It’s fun to go out with Haruna!” 

Thanks to Gematria’s Maestro, I used to only think of white mice and black crows in amusement parks except for its rides. She also helped a lot in repelling them at that time. 

So, despite we were with the mentality of conquering roadside stalls and not playing the rides, this routine was enough to make one feel refreshed. 

“Hehe... me too. After all, it’s being with my favorite person.” Haruna’s face panned with slight pink, her smile filled with a strong sense of happiness. 

She kneaded the taiyaki-shaped pillow in her hands. We went to the shooting range of the amusement park for its participation reward — brioche bread^(5), but we surprisingly got the grand prize — exactly that taiyaki-shaped pillow. 

*^(5 – A pastry of French whose high egg and butter content gives it a rich and tender crumb.)* 

At her request, I went in person and took the gun to shoot the targets. Despite being a teacher of Kivotos, I have no experience of holding a gun and have to rely on her teaching me hand-in-hand, with her snugged on me and manipulating me as a puppet, finally successfully hitting the target. 

Thinking of that soft touch and comfortable body temperature, I feel my cheeks burn a little. 

“But, can Sensei eat anymore? I’ve also prepared a bento^(6).” 

*^(6 – A Japanese-style single-portion take-out or home-packed meal, packaged in a box with a lid. A traditional bento typically includes rice or noodles with fish or some other meat, often with pickled and cooked vegetables.)* 

“Bento?” 

Haruna took out a dark blue patterned drawstring bag from the crossbody bag, then opened it, unveiling the wood-faux bento box that’s about 15cm long. 

“Considering that Sensei might still be a little full, I deliberately prepared it in smaller portions.” 

She opened the bento box. I was greeted with meatballs, cauliflower, tamagoyaki^(7), and white cooked rice sprinkled with black sesame, in colors of “red, green, yellow, white, black”. 

*^(7 – A type of Japanese omelet <omelette in British English> made by rolling together several layers of fried beaten eggs. It is often prepared in a rectangular omelet pan called a makiyakinabe or tamagoyaki <translated to “rolled omelets”>.)* 

Despite the small portion, it could still be seen that the bento was carefully prepared. 

“It looks great. Is it made by Haruna?” 

Most of the food from roadside stalls in the amusement park is full of starch and carbohydrates, which can easily cause satiety feelings. But if it’s a bento made by a student with their own hands, I can’t refuse it at will. 

“No. I entrusted Fuuka to make it.” 

“...You didn’t force her, right?” 

Aikiyo Fuuka belongs to the School Lunch Club and was recognized by Haruna as a chef. Usually, to find Fuuka and help Haruna cook, the latter has carried out countless kidnapping operations on the former, being the most direct persecution target of the Gourmet Research Society. 

From an outsider’s perspective, the relationship is between perpetrator and victim. But in fact, they aren’t as hostile as imagined. They even understand each other’s the best and maintain a wonderful relationship. 

“Hohoho, Fuuka has always been willing to help Sensei to cook.” 

Once Haruna was involved in topics about food, her concepts of ethics and morality would then be deviated from ordinary people, making it difficult to predict how many words from the smiling her could be called “normal”. 

“Let me feed you, Sensei.” 

Haruna picked up a meatball with her left hand, her right hand supporting from beneath, and handed it to me with half of her body turned and slightly leaned forward. 

“Here, Sensei, ah \~ hmm!” She opened and closed her mouth, giving me a beautiful smile. 

“Ah \~ hmm!” 

The meatball’s mouthfeel was firm and not loose. The sweet and salty teriyaki^(8) sauce and gravy coated at the surface perfectly blended, being a simple and delicious home-style taste. 

*^(8 – A cooking technique in which foods are broiled or grilled with a glaze of soy sauce, mirin <rice wine>, and sugar.)* 

With the experience of feeding each other on New Year and weekdays, I’m not ashamed even in public now. 

Indeed, habit truly is a horrifying thing. 

“What does Sensei think about it?” 

“Hmm! It’s very tasty! As expected, a meal made by Fuuka.” 

“Yes, it’s because of Fuuka-san.” 

It was as if I saw Haruna’s eyes losing their lights for a moment. But before I could think about it, a piece of tamagoyaki was already approaching my mouth. 

“Then let’s continue! Here, Sensei, ah \~” 

The meatballs just now already made me appetize. I ate the tamagoyaki in one bite without hesitation. The solid and rich taste revealed the faint egg aroma, without excessive seasonings like eating outside, the sweet taste has a slight salty taste that won’t steal the spotlight. 

It’s just that I suddenly felt weird. If it was the usual Haruna who understood that this was the special meal made by Fuuka, she would even disobey the Prefect Team just to use all means to get the first taste. 

“Aren’t you going to eat it, Haruna?” 

“Although I do also want to have Fuuka-san's meal, Sensei also knows that I don’t have such a large appetite. My stomach’s still full.” 

“Is it so?” 

Even not eating much, she’s the type of student who’s frustrated with their small appetite. Using the reason of herself being full to refuse doesn’t sound like something she would say. 

Even if her tone remained usual, I still felt like she was hiding something from me. 

Despite having suspicions, it’s an undeniable fact that the bento is delicious. I temporarily throw away my doubts, enjoying this taste called “every day”. 

 

 

 

Finishing the bento, I parted from Haruna by the reason of going to the restroom. 

To confirm my suspicion, I picked up my phone, opened Momotalk, and contacted the person. 

“Fuuka, are you free now?” 

“What’s the matter, Sensei?” 

“I’m here to say thank you. Thank you, Fuuka, for preparing the bento for me today.” 

“Bento?” 

About three minutes passed. 

“Sensei, you’re with Haruna right now, right?” 

She probably went to other Gourmet Research Society members to make the confirmation. The smile of Akari flashed through my mind. 

“Yes.” 

“Sensei, you have already guessed it. That’s why you contact me.” 

“I’m sorry, I just wanted to confirm it.” 

I don’t have a keen sense like Haruna that can tell who’s the one making the dishes. But as a teacher, it would be duty dereliction if I’m not sensing the abnormalities of the students. 

“It’s okay. But what does Sensei want to do on the part of Haruna?” 

“I have my methods. Thank you, Fuuka.” 

Fuuka’s side of Momotalk typing notification popped up and disappeared, going like this several times, as if she was hesitating to say something. 

“Sensei, please don’t disappoint her.” 

Fuuka used this short message as the conclusion, not entering messages anymore. 

Disappointed? I can’t understand Fuuka’s means. 

I don’t have thoughts of hurting Haruna. Even if she lied to me, it wouldn’t be a heinous mistake. 

Not to mention that even adults could make mistakes. They’re still young, and they still have chances to make amends even after making mistakes. 

But why would she say “Don’t disappoint her”? 

Ultimate taste and gourmet are her exploration’s goals, which are ethereal and elusive dreams. 

What does it have to do with the bento just now? 

In the brief conversation with Fuuka, I’m already almost a hundred percent sure about the bento maker, but I couldn’t figure out the reason why she does it. 

She does whatever it takes for her dreams. What exactly is she expecting? 

I remembered the matcha^(9) chocolate I made with her back on Valentine’s Day. 

*^(9 – A finely ground powder of green tea specially processed from shade-grown tea leaves. Shade growing gives matcha its characteristic bright green color and strong umami flavor.)* 

Why is it matcha chocolate? She answered that the sweetness in the dessert contains the intention of the giver. 

Just like when she once took me to eat a tomato plate^(10) that was added with a paste mixed with ginger and soy sauce. Adding saltiness to the original sweetness will make it taste even sweeter. In the same sense, the slight bitterness can also highlight the more obvious sweetness. 

*^(10 – A common specialty snack in southern Taiwan’s ice fruit shops, mostly called “ginger potato”. It was made by cutting black tomato <a type of potato brought by the Dutch via Indonesia to Taiwan during the Dutch Formosa> into cubes and serving it with a special dipping sauce.)* 

The final product might just be the ordinary chocolate, but it’s sweeter than the luxury matcha chocolate she gave me at the beginning. It’s because I felt the “intention” that was full in the chocolate made by her. 

So, this is just contrary to her idea. The external factor that makes food delicious are good ingredients, the external environment, and the intention of the maker, not the lies wrapped in sugar coatings. 

Then, why exactly? Why is she lying? 

I racked up my brain and thought. Every time a possibility was ruled out, I could more clearly sense the seed in my deep consciousness, planted at the heart’s bottom long ago, yet always deliberately avoided by me. 

Whenever I thought about everything about her, I could feel a certain warmth creeping up. It’s the emotion that has been slowly warming up ever since I’ve known her not soon after. 

I thought that it was supposed to be the emotion of protecting and supporting students, but that seed was faintly agitating and expressing dissatisfaction to me... 

At last, until meeting up with Haruna again, I still couldn’t figure out any possibilities... 

 

 

 

After an afternoon’s traveling, Haruna and I have conquered the amusement park’s stalls and facilities that are related to eating. 

Of course, since we had already come to the amusement park, I suggested that we should at least play some rides, and Haruna accepted my proposal. 

Since it’s an amusement park, you have to play the most classic rides — roller coasters! 

But when the roller coaster climbed up to the top like a panting old cow, I looked down and regretted the wrong decision I’d made. 

Noticing my body that’s trembling due to nervousness and fear, Haruna took my hands. 

“I’m here, Sensei.” 

The temperature from her palm made me feel staid at that moment. 

“I — I’m fine,” I said stubbornly. 

However, the moment when the coaster swooped down, my adult role was already floated and sped away as my organs were rapidly thrown around. 

I didn’t dare open my eyes the whole time, and couldn’t help but scream with my mouth open. 

I could also hear other scared and excited screams from other tourists beside my ears. Haruna’s voice was also mixed in, but the current me couldn’t analyze whether she was happy or scared at all. 

The roller coaster lasted about five minutes, yet it felt like five years as long. It wasn’t until Haruna reminded me that the ordeal was over. 

“Is Sensei alright?” 

I desperately gasped for air, holding down the heart that could jump out of my chest at any moment. 

“I — I'm okay, I’m okay.” I waved my hands to signal that Haruna didn’t have to worry about me. 

She got up first, helping me to lift the safety lever, unbuckling my seatbelt, and helped me out of my seat. 

“How embarrassing...” 

Right now, I’m just like a kid who got scared out of their wits. I just didn’t cry and throw myself into the hands of Haruna. 

And because too much food was taken on the first half day’s trip, my stomach was already churning and protesting to me. 

If I get the same stimulation again, I'm afraid that I will waste that well-prepared bento. 

I struggled and suppressed this discomfort, suggesting playing lighter rides, which Haruna also gladly accepted. 

We then played rides like coffee cups, small trains, and merry-go-rounds. Until the middle summer’s sun illuminated the departing crowd with its remaining orange glow, we boarded the Ferris wheel moments before the amusement park was closing. 

The cabin was a bit stuffy, and to add up a long day’s trip, I could even smell the sweat on my body. Thus, I chose to sit across from Haruna. 

Of course, the main reason for this was because of the bento box, which made it necessary for me to assign seats like this that were ready to lecture. 

“Haruna.” 

I whispered to Haruna. She was looking out the window with her hand against her chin as if she were lost in thoughts. 

“What’s wrong? Sensei.” 

She turned to me with a suspecting expression. 

“Did you have fun today?” 

“Of course. Even though I didn’t taste delicacies, the time spent with Sensei is the happiest and most precious time for me.” 

“Me too. But I have a question that I want to ask Haruna to answer for me.” 

“Hmm?” 

“Today’s bento wasn’t made by Fuuka, right.” 

I accentuated my tone, looking at Haruna with a serious gaze. 

She looked surprised at first, then soon recovered her confidence and the composure look. 

“Seems like my acting wasn’t that proficient yet.” 

If it weren’t for the flaws in her words, her attitude which is just as usual would’ve deceived me long ago. 

She smiled shallowly, and her tone contained no guilt as if it was just blowing up unsatisfying meals and establishments as usual, thinking that it was just as natural as turning off faucet taps. 

“It’s Fuuka-san who told Sensei this, right?” 

Haruna didn’t ask how I found it out and straight out admitted it instead, even guessing that I had asked Fuuka about it. 

I nodded and continued asking: “Why would you say it’s made by Fuuka?” 

I went straight to the problem’s core, which is also the point that I couldn’t figure out. The Haruna I knew was impossible to tell such lies, since it wouldn’t benefit her, and it went against her aesthetics of the gourmet. 

“Because I’m afraid.” 

“Huh?” My eyes widened like the looks of beans. 

Even being repeatedly harshly lectured by the leader of the Disciplinary Committee or arrested by the law enforcement units from other schools, she never said this word. 

“Afraid” shouldn’t be the word that appears in this student’s dictionary^(11). 

*^(11 – <<Translator’s Note>> In Chinese, when we say that “a word won’t appear in someone’s dictionary”, it means that the person’s usual behaviors don’t match what the said word describes. In this example, it means that Haruna’s usual behaviors are wide and open and don’t contain any elements of being afraid of getting caught.)* 

“I’m afraid that Sensei would be disappointed in my cooking,” Haruna explained. 

Haruna will hand over the ingredients she obtained to chefs that she recognizes rather than cooking them by herself. 

Based on past experiences, she can make normal dishes, just that there’s a risk of disaster in the process. Compared to improving her “cooking skills”, she longs for the ultimate “tastes” more. 

This is also the main reason why she kept kidnapping Fuuka. Even though the reputation of Gehenna’s student restaurant isn’t good, she still understands Fuuka’s true strength, recognizing her as the best chef. 

“Of course, I know that things like this don’t look like what I would do. But whenever I was preparing this bento and remembered how Sensei praised the deliciousness of the chocolates I made, I couldn’t help but feel afraid —” 

She clutched the clothes around her chest. Her expression was pain as if she’s about to suffocate. 

“— What if Sensei doesn’t want to eat the bento I made? What if I can’t get the praise from Sensei? Whenever I think of these questions, my heart has the feeling of going to be torn apart. And so, I lied to Sensei that it was Fuuka-san who made the bento. Then, under this atmosphere, Sensei won’t feel unpalatable, right?” 

She barely squeezed out a wry smile from her face distorted by pain, said self-deprecatingly: “Kurodate Haruna, who only got food in her mind. Sensei would not think that’s something I would say, nor think that’s the annoyances I would have.” 

“You know that I won’t do it.” 

I trust the ingredients chosen by Haruna because intention is important. Understanding her intentions, even if her cooking skills weren’t as good as those famous chefs, I believe that her respect for food won’t be low compared to anyone. 

So, she's impossible to not understand it. But she's showing her fear now, which means... 

That seed seemed to be stirring. 

“That’s right. Because you’re Sensei.” 

Supporting students is my responsibility and obligation, and it’s what she’s trying to express. 

Haruna got up gracefully and sat down beside me. I was worried that my sweat smell would affect her and tried moving my hips away, but she held my hand and stopped me. 

“It’s this tenderness... you can’t help but take advantage of it.” 

She leaned to the side in whole and closed her eyes, with her long eyelashes dangled. 

I can feel her relax her body, trusting me that I won’t resist. 

As with the same size of her slender body, I didn’t feel too much pressure. No matter how powerful Kivoto’s students are, they’re still essentially average girls. 

I don’t feel ashamed, because this student has shown me her rarely-seen weakness. 

They have the child’s innocence, optimism, and annoyance. 

Even if they make mistakes, these children still retain their innocent hearts, and this is the place where adults should guide them gently.  

“Sensei is disappointed with me that I lied about my important things, right.” She muttered with a pun. 

“Although it’s no good lying, I’m still glad to find out that Haruna values Fuuka and me so much.” 

“Why would Sensei think of it like that?” 

“Because you're impossible to damage Fuuka’s reputation as a chef. So, even if lies have to be told, you must have tasted the bento until you’re satisfied and let me eat it.” 

I stroked her head and said: “Thank you, Haruna. Today’s bento is truly delicious.” 

This is the purest encouragement I can give her now, without any untruths. 

“Sensei...” 

“But you can’t lie to me anymore. I’ve been worried about what happened to you.” 

“Then be it...” 

As if she had decided something, Haruna gripped my hand. 

“Then it’s the turn for Sensei to answer for me. Do you know why I’m doing these things that don’t look like what I would do?” 

“Well...” 

Haruna always talks about the word “like”, and that she’s at the age of advocating love for the most, impossible for her to not know why. 

I'm clear of her purpose, but I couldn’t say it, because I’m a teacher, and she’s a student. This is the line of taboo^(12) that mustn’t be crossed. 

*^(12 – A social group’s ban, prohibition, or avoidance of something < is usually an utterance or behavior> based on the group’s sense that it is excessively repulsive, offensive, sacred, or allowed only for certain people.)* 

On one hand, I’m thinking about how to explain. On the other hand, my responsibility and sanity were desperately suppressing the restlessness seed.  

“If you want to taste the ultimate taste, then you can’t hesitate to move forward.” 

As Haruna finished her words, she held my cheeks with both hands and quickly turned in her direction, following with a soft touch engraved on my lips. 

It’s the once-in-a-lifetime emotional imprint that most people consider to be the most important. 

At the instant that I couldn’t react, she snatched my first kiss. 

“Do you understand this emotion of mine as dense as fondue^(13) now, Sensei?"" 

*^(13 – A Swiss dish of melted cheese and wine served in a communal pot <caquelon or fondue pot> over a portable stove heated with a candle or spirit lamp <chafing fuel>, and eaten by dipping bread and sometimes vegetables or other foods into the cheese using long-stemmed forks.)* 

I’m not surprised by her emotions for me, since many students have expressed them to me before. However, I stood by my duty and didn’t give anyone the chance to cross that line. 

But this sudden move of hers has already crossed the line between teacher and student. 

Joy, anger, sadness, happiness, and so on, all these emotions mixed, like a witch’s cauldron showing assorted colors. 

Haruna is a student, and I’m her teacher. Same as other students, the relationship should just stay like this. 

However, just as ignoring other’s troubles for the sake of her dreams, she forced me to cross that line, forced me to face her affection, and forced me to find that seed lurking in the parched ground. 

“Sensei?” 

Seeing that I was dazed on the seat and didn’t move, Haruna leaned towards me worried. 

I reflexively grabbed her hands that’s stretching out. 

“? ! ! ? ! ? ! ! ? ! ? ?” Haruna bounced once in a panic. 

I couldn’t tell what expressions were on my face now, just instinctively approached her. 

Her face panned with a layer of pink that was even deeper, eyesight wandering and dropping, trying to avoid my gaze. 

However, as I approached her at less than half a person’s distance, she slightly lifted her chin as if it were attracted by a magnet. 

Our lip flaps overlapped again. 

Why did we take such actions? 

Is it for proof? Is it for satisfaction? Is it for desire? 

No, neither of them... What exactly do I want? 

Tongues intertwined eagerly, like two greedy snakes snatching each other’s saliva. 

I ungripped my hands on her, both hands slowly stroking down her body, feeling every inch of her skin, feeling the wrinkles on her clothes, feeling her delicate figure, only wanting to find the answer to this confusing emotion, and finally followed my instinct and touched her proud peaks. 

Her faintly audible panting was vibrating my eardrums, successfully excited my long-suppressed emotions down in my heart. 

“Don’t disappoint her.” 

The words from Fuuka have been seen through my heart already. I have liked her long ago all along. 

I like Haruna. 

She’s not only my student but also the girl that I like. 

I had different experiences with different students, only the memories with her overwhelmingly occupied my mind. 

Even if deliberately ignored by responsibility and morality, that seed remained tenacious and buried deep down the soil, waiting for the irrigations from this affection, to break out from the dirt and sprout, and become a towering tree. 

Untying the heavy shackles, handing everything to the body for making the most honest movements, tasting each other’s flavor on the tongue’s tip just like enjoying gourmet, swallowing each other’s temperature, digesting each other’s affection in the stomach. 

Finally, the lips and tongues parted with the arch bridge built of silver filigree still between us, our faces were smeared with a drunken redness under the atmosphere heated by the fiery emotions. 

At this time, there’s a sudden click outside from the door. We then shockingly realized that the Ferris wheel had finished a cycle and the staff was about to open the door. 

Haruna’s hair and clothes were both a little messy. I took off my coat and draped over her head, hiding her face and body, escorting her on my shoulders, and walked away quickly. 

I didn’t forget to peek at the staff’s side face. He showed a commonplace look of helplessness. 

“So sorry...” I could only silently apologize to him in my heart. 

 

 

 

“Hohoho, it’s cute to see Sensei being nervous like this.” 

“I’m probably losing my teacher qualification...” 

Haruna and I straightened up our clothes, back facing towards the setting sun, heading to the amusement park’s exit gate. 

“Sensei is still a teacher. Just like how the same dish has different names in different places, it's just that you have one more identity. So —” 

I placed my index finger between my lips, signaling her to say no more. 

It’s impossible that the current I promise that kind of thing, despite that we have already made a move against morality. 

Besides, if she got declined, how would Haruna feel? With what kind of expression? Can we still meet like this after the relationship was broken? 

Can I, who could only respond as a “teacher”, really respond to her affection? 

So, I'm okay with being scolded as a coward or good-for-nothing, just keep the current relationship. 

Yes, just like that... 

“Then be it. Because it’s Sensei.” 

Fortunately, although Haruna has an almost crazy obsession with food, she’s still an understanding student normally. 

Her soft eyesight and smile made direct indications that she understood my difficulties. 

“But I’m happy. Sensei is indeed the delicacy, and it’s the ultimate taste that I’m after.” 

“Well, I don’t quite understand this...” 

Is saliva also considered a delicacy? I suddenly felt as if my saliva was divided into two flavors. 

Besides, being treated as a delicacy by her doesn’t seem to be a “good thing”. 

“Hohoho, in that case, I do have a suggestion. I just didn’t know that if Sensei’s free in the evening?”  

“Huh? I’m free.” 

It’s a holiday and I don’t have to work. And, when Haruna invited me to the amusement park, I’d already emptied all other itineraries. 

“It’s dinner time now, so let’s get to the nice restaurant I found last time!” 

I was about to ask if there would be seats. After all, if it’s a restaurant that she approved, there should be a lot of customers. 

But then Haruna’s thumb quickly tapped on the phone screen, showing it to me. 

It shows “VIP reservation completed”. 

""As expected for you...” 

I smiled wryly and secretly admired her capacity to act. 

“Mufufu, what kind of different tastes could I taste today? It’s truly exciting!” 

“Got new ideas again? What should I do?” 

“Ah, Sensei’s so cooperative?” 

“After all...” 

Even if we have already stepped on the taboo, that bitterness backflowing like nausea is regurgitating the immorality, stuffing back the sweet words that are about to blurt out back into my throat. 

Haruna’s look got a little discouraged when she saw this, but she immediately gave me a warm and elegant smile again. 

She hooked my arm between her soft twin peaks, faint flush appeared on her face. 

As if she’s declaring that this was her place — 

— Her ultimate gourmet. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Translator’s Postscript – 2025/01/19** 

If you have seen the 18-page version on the Discord Elevator, then congrats to you! It’s just the same as the full version here, except that forewords and postscripts are missing (since the TL wasn’t finished at that time). 

I hope everyone enjoyed reading this. Are those footnotes informative enough? (Taken from various sources and reworded into one paragraph) I quite loved and hated these footnotes so much, as they kind of serve as a marking point of my TL progress at all times. Well, at least it’s over now. 

This post marks the beginning of the second series I’m translating (the other series is Sensei’s Handbook). Again, this is from a TW Sensei. No, I don’t know how capable they are in terms of cooking dishes like this, but it’s top-tier ones if not higher. 

About “Because of all kinds of factors, I’m not sure if I would be writing a new part”. We got 15 more parts to go, so yeah. 

I would call the two main writing styles on the “IS ON FIRE” flair “uppercase style” and “lowercase style”. How does this lowercase style post feel? This is already the 6^(th) post I have translated, so it should be more readable as compared to the first 2 posts I translated (at least if I hope so). 

As usual, links in the comment section. I haven’t decided whether to continue the translation of “Ultimate Gourmet” or “Sensei’s Handbook” yet, so stay tuned.

I really wanted to try some 3rd party pods and crossed my fingers for better coffee. I figured it's Costco so if I didn't like it, I could return it. I'm keeping it.

The Vertuo coffee isn't very good to me. I usually end up just using expert mode on it and I missed Peet's coffee. The coffee is definitely better in the L'Or and I like how you can make them different sizes if you want it stronger or more diluted.

I also started trying out some 3rd party pods which only come in OL. I'm enjoying the process very much! Illy pods are delicious. Once I'm through this pack, I have some other ones to try.

So I'm keeping both I guess and both have their strengths over the other. The Pop+ makes a lot more crema so good or bad depending on your personal taste. And it's definitely better if you need double shots since the L'Or would need 2 pods. the Pop+ is better for syrupy espresso drinks IMO.

Peet's coffee is yummy! And you can still reuse the pods or get refillable ones if you like. You also do not need to heat it up because it's actually hot! I always had to brew an empty pod in the Pop+ to get a better temp (even if I warmed up the mug first). So if coffee if your main drink and occasional espresso drinks, L'Or is the way to go.

I saw there are now fancy instant coffees. That made me think back to my late mother making Taster's Choice and those Folger's television advertisements from when we were young. I don't drink much coffee at all. But I got to thinking how much this has changed, and I know nobody, I mean literally not one single person, who has Taster's Choice or Folger's in their cupboard. I associate it with the generation older than us.

But there also are other things that I know I prefer the fake to the real. The easiest example to point to is maple syrup. Of course, genuine maple syrup existed when we were young. But my family didn't have that much money; I thought that stuff was for rich folks. We once took a road trip (we flew maybe never, not once that I recall, as a family with all the kids) to New England, and we went to Vermont, and I experienced maple syrup for the first time. Well, I have to confess, to the horror of those who are ""foodies,"" I prefer ""breakfast"" syrup to maple syrup. It's what I grew up on. I realize it's bad for you. The transition from frozen concentrate orange juice to fresh squeezed happened, at least for me, about the time I went to college, so I do not prefer the frozen concentrate that came in those cardboard tubes, but I don't mind it at all.

I'm wondering if this just changed over time, and this product category, or this brand, became obsolete or much less significant. I know you can still buy it. But who does? Any of you drinking Taster's Choice? Or was that Baby Boomers? Do kids like it? ",57,1737297616.0,GenX,192,0.88,False

Currently looking to get a bean to cup solution that offers good value for money, but most importantly, is accessible for my blind girlfriend.  
As it's our first, we are looking for an entry level machine and from what I read here, you can't really go wrong with Delonghi.  
Ideally we would like something like the Magnifica Start with the milk reservoir (around 400€) or the EVO with the reservoir (around 470€), as that seems like a super convenient way of having great coffee and even a cappucino/latte. However, I am a bit worried about the buttons being hard to use and locate for a blind person. My idea would be to stick a small sticker on the button so she can feel where it is. Do you know if the buttons still register with something in between or is it like a touch screen, that wont work anymore?  
As an alternative, I was considering the Magnifica Smart S (around 300€), which seems to me to be a straight upgrade on the Magnifica S due to double boilers as it has haptical buttons, but of course doesn't offer milk-based drinks at the push of a button. 

Do you have any ideas on the accessibility of the Magnifica Start or could you try out if the buttons still work with a sticker on them? It would be a really great help for us :) We are also open to other models or manufacturers as well, if you have any suggestions.   
Also, do you happen to know how well the integrated frother in the Start works with oatly barista oat milk? I didn't find anything conclusive on that yet...

Anyway, would really appreciate some input on value for money and better yet personal experiences if you happen to know any blind users of said machines or similar ones. 

Thanks a lot in advance :)

  
E: I also saw the basic Eletta on offer where I live (Belgium) for 529€ (we set our budget at max 500, but only if its a reasonable jump up from the Smart S) but it seems very inaccessible with the LCD display, any ideas on this?

How do I deal with this situation?,"Hi everyone, typical clarifications first: throwaway for all the usual reasons, all names changed to protect identities.

TLDR: I introduced my ex to rock climbing, a long time hobby of mine. When we broke up, they got very territorial about it despite the pain that caused me. I stopped going for a while and worked on myself. Now, over a year later, I walked into a coffee shop they were in, and it seems to have shaken them so severely that they have used their position as an employee at the only climbing centre for miles to get me banned. I can’t get ahold of anyone who might have any more information and I don’t know what to do.

-

Me, (M22) and my Ex, Em (NB22) broke up a year and a bit ago due to communication issues. They struggled dealing with stress due to traumatic experiences in their past, and I knew that going in to the relationship, however I also saw the active work they were putting in and thought that they were someone worth sticking around and supporting while they worked through their past. Our relationship lasted for two years. 

When talking about stressful situations, they would exhibit a range of behaviours from switching to one word answers, going non verbal, or lying (saying yes when they meant no for example) to get out of the conversation. I understood this, and we worked together through the relationship to try to address these problems as best as we could. My breaking point came when communication broke down around sex and their suggestion was to stop talking about/doing it for two weeks to alleviate the pressure they felt around the topic. I did my best to follow along, but found myself clarifying a lot what kinds of flirting counted as flirting to do with sex. 

Predictably, without solid communication, this got quite stressful, and after around a week, I tried to initiate a conversation around how I was struggling to feel stable or supported, doubly so due to my own history of previous partners violating boundaries when it comes to sex. Over around three hours of broken up communication I tried to seek emotional support from my partner (which was rare in the first place). I got essentially nothing back other than one word answers. This culminated in me having a panic attack which I had to pull myself out of because they were incapable of doing anything other than watching me go through it. That event was why I ended up breaking up with them. We were not healthy for each other, and staying together would only have driven us into hating each other. I couldn’t help them through their trauma any more. 

I got into that situation because of my tendency to seek out people in crisis and support them to my own detriment, as that was where I learnt to draw my sense of worth from as a child. Suffice it to say I have worked on that, gone to therapy, improved myself, and I am now passively waiting for a stable, healthy partner to come into my life, rather than actively seeking out someone to help. 

Rock Climbing has been a hobby of mine for over six years now. When me and Em initially got together, it was something I introduced them to. They took to it like a spark to a tinderbox, and going once a week together served a foundational part of our relationship. We’d drive out, stay until the centre closed, grab food on the way home, and watch an episode or two of whichever show we were making our way through at the time. Those days are some of my happiest memories with them. When we broke up, we were going twice a week together and had a strong social circle of friends at the centre who we both got along with well. After breaking up, we agreed that neither of us wanted to lose the friends or the hobby, and so we split the two days between each of us; me going on Thursday and Em on Monday. We also agreed to stay in communication with each other and keep each other up to date with our climbing schedules so we wouldn’t have to run into each other. 

This worked for a couple months, until I learned from a friend that they had started going twice a week. I would have rather they told me that themselves, but other than that I wasn’t bothered. I figured it was understandable to want to restore the old schedule. I gave it a month or so, then started going twice a week myself, with Sunday being the only other regular time I had free. They responded to this by asking a mutual friend (Milly, 22F) to tell me that they were annoyed at me for doing so as they wanted to go on Sundays, acting as their third day. I tried to have a conversation about this, attempting to point out the imbalance. I still struggled with all the feelings around heartbreak at that time, being three months out of the relationship, and it hurt a helluva lot to be around them, so I very much wanted to work out a way to create a separated space for myself, as I really did not want to lose the hobby. Their response essentially amounted to:

“I don’t have an issue with climbing days at the moment. Milly said you were thinking of doing Sundays and volunteered to tell you I was climbing some Sundays so you were warned. It is up to you what to do with that information, but I am not willing to sacrifice my freedom to climb. The centre is big enough to avoid each other if we really need to in my opinion” 
(an actual, word for word text they sent me)

This hurt for a fair few reasons I’m sure I don’t need to list, least of all the fact that this mirrored the cause of our break up. But there was nothing to do beyond that, any further conversation fell flat. They were trying to look after themselves, and while yes, they were neglecting my emotions while doing so, we had broken up, so they didn’t owe me that in the first place. I figured I’d have to learn to exist around them somehow anyway, so I tried my best to do so. 

Then they got a job at the climbing centre. 

They had applied to the job before we broke up (and were going to pass on the application without me convincing them they were capable of it) and while they didn’t get through on that round, the centre had another slot open up two months after the breakup, which they took. After that, they were at the centre almost constantly, and would use their responsibilities to do a check of the centre every 20 minutes or so and start up a conversation with our mutual friends; mutual friends I was climbing with most of the time. This was uh… stressful to say the least, and I found myself slowly losing interest in the hobby because I was worrying about having to interact with them more than I was enjoying the sport. 

Then they got a new boyfriend and started bringing him climbing. 

That, alongside a crush I had developed at the climbing centre myself being turned down, was my final straw. I had tried for months to keep this hobby of mine stress free and intact, but there was nothing I could do that wouldn’t cause me pain anymore. So I stopped going. Following this, despite my best attempts, I lost friends, I lost a pretty fundamental part of my life, I lost a way to vent stress, a way to socialise. I lost contact with someone I saw as a mentor and a role model, I lost contact with a kid I saw as a surrogate little brother. Not that it factors into much else, but this was during my finals at university, and at the same time, my little sister was diagnosed with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition I am currently being tested for myself. Suffice it to say, not a great part of my life.

However. Nothing to be done about it other than move on, pick up the pieces I had left, and build something better for myself. So I spent the rest of 2024 doing my best at that. I threw myself into cooking and gardening, focused on drawing (another long time hobby of mine) and pivoted my fitness over to training callisthenics at a local gym. I founded a company with seven friends, and running that business is now my full time job. I spent a good chunk of time travelling, I did a lot of therapy, I made new friends. I maintained a couple of the friendships from climbing, predominantly with Milly, and the two of us meet up in town for coffee every so often. She broadly disagrees with how Em handled things, but those interactions have always had a tinge of pain to them due to the knowledge of that mutual connection. I’ve even had a few people that I started to fall for, but none of them worked out for one reason or another. (One was moving to New Zealand, one wasn’t ready for commitment, a couple I decided wouldn’t be healthy for me, etc.) Regardless, I have spent the past year seriously working on my life, and I can now proudly say with my chest that I am happy on my own, happy with my life, and almost entirely over Em. I’ve even started to get back into climbing, having found a new group of people from the office that go regularly, early in the morning, on a day that Em doesn’t work. 

That should be where the story ends, but if it was, I wouldn’t be writing this. 

Three days ago I walked past a new coffee shop in town at the end of my lunch break and thought it would be nice to pop in and grab something. However, just as I went to do so, I saw a few people in the window: Milly, a friend from university (Winter, 22NB), and Em. I reflexively walked away and just went back to the office, but just as I was arriving I realised that I didn’t need to avoid them anymore. I wasn’t stressed and I wasn’t in pain, I just reflexively avoided the coffee shop in anticipation of those feelings. So I called my best mate just to make sure my idea wasn’t crazy, walked back to that coffee shop and ordered a pastry, just to prove to myself that I could. Happy to report; no heart flutters, no struggling with my words, no pinching, burning feeling at the back of my neck, just a somewhat dry pastry and a wave to some friends. Em however, looked like they had seen a ghost and went to the bathroom the moment they saw me. I didn’t say anything to them, didn’t even make eye contact. I did think that was an interesting reaction for someone who was so in favour of being in the same space while it was hurting me, but I figured it was not my problem anymore, and I did not have to worry about it at all. This thought combined with my surprise at how stable I felt made me pretty proud of myself and how far I had come. I had a little dance along the street as I walked back to the office. 

And then, the day after, on Friday evening, I got a call from a number I did not recognise. Upon picking up, I was greeted by a voice I recognised as the manager from the climbing centre. He proceeded to inform me: “an employee is currently uncomfortable with your presence at the centre due to an undiscussed issue. Until they have moved on, you will not be allowed to climb at the centre anymore”. To say the very least, this hurt pretty bad. That pain turned to confusion, then anger, then sadness, and then all back over again. I asked if there was anything I could do, he said no. I asked if there was any other information I could have. He said no. That climbing centre is the only one for an hour and a half in any direction from where I live. Em was not willing to sacrifice their freedom to climb when it hurt me, three months after the breakup, but over a year later, when they have been in another relationship for a good while now, they are apparently more than willing to sacrifice mine if it is hurting them. Suffice it to say I’m in pain, I don’t know what to do, and I really, really wish I didn’t have to deal with any of this. 

I’ve told my friends and family about the situation, and they’ve all offered their condolences and condemnations. I’ve managed to get in contact with one person connected to the situation; Winter, the uni friend who was at the coffee shop on Thursday. They had no idea this was happening, and pretty conclusively condemned it as wrong, but couldn’t offer me much more advice than that. they offered to talk to Em, but I didn’t want Winter to need to get involved, so I declined. I have tried to get in contact with Milly and a few other old mutuals from climbing; calling and texting each person a couple times over the last few days, but I have heard nothing back. I know they are all terrible at responding to messages, but it’s really messing with me that I don’t know whether they are avoiding me or just ignorant of the situation. 

And that is where I am now. Banned from a hobby I was just returning to by a person who should not be relevant in my life whatsoever, struggling to gain any more information on the situation, and just generally struggling to function because of the stress it is causing. I know that the ultimate endpoint of this is to try to talk to Em, but I have almost no faith that will get me anywhere. 

I could go on for pages more about all the other behaviour that backs up this pattern: The fact that I tried with all my heart to keep both our lives intact after the breakup, never bringing up anything to do with Em to anyone I knew as a mutual, trying to avoid people sharing pictures of hang outs I was at, knowing it would hurt them to know they weren’t included, etc. All the while they did things like blow up at me at a bar for “Taking friends away from them because you are sad” (I left a party we were both at when I heard some people were going to a bar) But in all honesty, it’s just going to be things you already know. I am at a loss of how to deal with this situation, and I am in way too much pain to make a coherent decision about it.

Baba Chops is introverted and will probably be easy to avoid if we don't go in her house. Rabie Baby is a gossip and a liar So we could tell her fake gossip that she can spread around to start problems with others and keep them distracted. Simon Smoke is extremely full of himself and a jerk, we could use Rabie to say that the others are saying that he's not good at anything or whatever and start problems between them or just feed his ego ourselves so he doesn't kill us. Touille is gonna be a trader of sorts, give him something and he'll tell us what an item we have is for. Now for Maggie Mako, she's the reason I'm making this post in the first place, she is described as a major food lover and slightly gluttonous and I took that and ran and I took that and ran, I think that she because she's chocolate scented probably started eating herself and possibly some of the others that had food smells and I think we're going to have to cover ourselves in something gross to avoid her so she doesn't eat us. Poe hates the sun and liked listening to music, he'll probably be slightly deaf due to having headphones on/listening to it too loud and won't go in the light, he'll probably have an area with flickering lights like we did with the teacher. Allister Gator is lazy and seems to wait for good things to come to him so I think we're going to have to avoid his interaction sone or stay out of his sight cuz we're ""the good thing coming to him"" and we'll probably have to avoid any water on the level. Icky Licky is a sore loser but is apparently skilled at the same stuff when they applied themselves, I think we're going to have to use Rabie to pin Icky against Simon and start a fight between them so they either kill each other or are distracted long enough to get by, Icky is also a poison dart frog so I think we're going to have to use their poison at some point. I know nothing of the new chapter that's coming out and what characters that probably are dead, I am not a part of mob games this is all just speculation based on the very little details I know myself.",3,1737297104.0,PoppyPlaytime,0,0.71,False

This footage, captured by an omniscient, time travelling invisible cameraman, is edited to remove all context, and seemingly accentuates the critical nature of the remark.

The classification of ""negative"", and the individuals in scope, are broad - it could range from exasperated exclamations from a driver you merged in front of, to your oldest friends undertaking a calculated character assassination of you while drinking coffee.  
  
The session takes as long as is necessary. Toilet and food breaks are allowed and timed, and the footage is paused during them (but obviously with them comes the knowledge that they were even necessary for you in the first place).

You are allowed to leave before the footage finishes - but if you do, the $1 million is entirely forfeit.

1i4znsp,https://i.redd.it/b5tzd2z0oyde1.jpeg,Recovery is tanked,"I quit caffeine 12 days ago. It wasn’t super difficult this time. I was consuming around 350-400mg (one 16oz mug of European style coffee and 3-4 10-12oz mugs of decaf). 

I do see positives. I feel calmer. My sugar cravings are gone. I sleep well (or so I think). My skin looks better. 

However my overnight recovery went down. I use Apple Watch and Bevel app here to show. In the beginning of January when I was sugar free but still consumed caffeine you see green circles which indicate great night rest. HRV numbers are high indicating great state of health. As you can see now last 13 days are not green anymore although my sleep is uninterrupted, 7-8 hours at consistent times. The only change is no caffeine. 

And it is getting worse! I also like to see stress score during sleep. If before no matter what stress I had during the day, during sleep my stress was always in a low zone. Sometimes it would spike here and there (not all night) into moderate stress and those were usually nights when I would binge on sugar before sleep - like consume a whole chocolate bar. These days I am sugar free. Caffeine free. The first week my sleep was okay. The second week it started getting worse. Deep sleep gets less and less. I see extremely vivid dreams (many of you shared the same). Also stress levels throughout the night get higher and higher. 

I find it a bit concerning. I understand that it takes time to normalise everything and when my wellness numbers crashed in the beginning, I wasn’t concerned as I expected it. But the fact that after all headaches are long gone, on my 13th day my wellness numbers seem only worse and worse. 

Did anyone experienced a prolonged and WORSENING overtime wellness? What did you do? According to my AI fitness tracker I am not supposed to be able to handle any strain as I wake up with 30% recovery as opposed yo 90%. It is quite annoying and it feels I am moving backwards.

We were together for 4 years. 
He kept saying I was too negative, when I don’t believe I am not and neither do my friends and family. We would talk about normal things that happen during the day. And he said that everything that I say it’s negative. For example i stayed at his on Friday and the coffee machine was broken; I sent him a video whilst he was at work saying what was wrong and that I couldn’t make coffee. He then FaceTimed me saying it was working with him and that he’ll just get a new coffee machine for me (he was meant to gift me that one). These were the type of things be labelled as negative.
I can be an over sharer at times so I asked him to compromise so we couldn’t have a “meeting” onde a week where I can tell him my so called “bad” experiences; so that maybe I can prioritise and see what really needs sharing. Even thought I don’t think I am negative? I just comment on things but I need to see his point of view. 
He also stated that I did not compliment him enough, that his work colleague acknowledged more than me the fact he was an immigrant and that he came to the country alone and I hardly said anything like that to him. 
Bear in mind I am an immigrant myself too and after therapy I realise how much it meant me complementing him and telling him how much he’s been through and where he is now. 
Apparently it was never enough. 

I am not looking for sympathy and I am not looking for sides. It would take a whole book to explain the relationship but I want the perspective of people that do not know us and the fact that he broke up based on this. 
I believe he is looking for someone to adapt to him and he won’t have anything more or less. Unless it is a comfort zone for him he will not let anyone be in his life. I also believe he does not feel good about himself and is giving me the responsibility of making himself feel good. 
What are your opinions ? 

No point of asking but can you please try and be kind lol. This happened less than 24 hours ago. 


EDIT; 
I do not do this on a daily or weekly basis. Let’s say he texts me “how is your day going” and I reply “chaotically busy, I have not stopped yet” he perceives that as negative. 

I dot not do this whilst he is at work all the time. I do make my best to support him through this job. He can be also negative complaining about work and calling me asking me for opinions which I do help. However I did ask for his help to fix the coffee machine as he has used it before and it was THE FIRST TIME I WAS USING IT!! 
But I realise that I can send or say stuff he perceives as negative and not add a positive aspect (thanks to a Reddit commenter)

**What worked great**: Freshly squeezed mandarin juice, added mint leaves and muddled, then reduced in a small saucepan on the lowest heat possible on my stove for around 3-4 hours.

At first glance, The Fall Guy might seem like a bubblegum, pop-mystery action flick wrapped in a half-baked meta narrative. But much like The Last Action Hero, I’m willing to bet dollars to donuts that this film will remain one of the most rewatchable for decades to come. While it may be criminally underrated in terms of box office numbers, it’s one of those rare gems that reminds us why we love cinema.

Before diving deeper into my lax-a-daisy analysis, here are a few points to lay the groundwork, which for now are low hanging fruit:

1. The chemistry and charisma of the leads, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are so magnetic, if quantified as a fiat currency, it could fund a small republic.
2. The film’s pacing, cuts, color, and dialogue are not just fun, they make you believe that the actors had a blast filming it. The energy practically leaps off the screen.
3. The supporting characters are infectious. Every actor gives it their all, making each performance unforgettable.
4. The plot, though simple, doesn’t miss a beat and keeps you engaged.
5. The directing is near-perfect, an absolute masterclass in keeping the audience engaged.

Why This Movie Is Smarter Than It Looks

Tropes
Tropes are what they are because they work. Whether it’s the evil stepmother, the “will they won’t they” romance, the retiring hero, or the comeback kid, these narrative devices resonate with us for a reason. They tap into our shared desires and dreams, elevating the ordinary into something extraordinary. The director of The Fall Guy is fully aware of this and plays with these tropes in a way that’s both self-aware and sincere. He knows the audience loves them, even as they might groan at their predictability. But the beauty lies in how effortlessly these familiar tropes are woven into the story. One of my favourites is the buddy comedy chase with the dog… the slow mo car jump, the playful banter, god, so good. It’s a delicate balancing act between love and hate, which the viewer can appreciate, and it works brilliantly.

The Movie Star
There’s been a growing sentiment that the ""movie star"" is dead, largely due to shifting audience habits, the decline of traditional movie-going, and the recent now fading overwhelming dominance of superhero franchises, where the characters generally eclipse the actors. The fall guy even cracks a small joke referencing Tom Cruise, long referenced as the last true movie star, several times. But The Fall Guy makes a compelling case for the return of the true movie star. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are stars in every sense of the word, and the film understands this, and does a great job highlighting this. The backdrop of the film-within-a-film emphasizes the importance of the leads, surrounded by a slew of people constantly (also a nod to the sheer number of crew needed to make a big budget blockbuster): the plot doesn’t move forward unless they (the stars) push it. One standout moment is when Gosling and Blunt’s characters hash out their troubled past in front of the entire cast, both in-universe and within the film. It’s a meta-commentary on how the stars can be the driving force behind not just this story, but the entire industry, and are carefully supported by a small army of well positioned, worker-bee professionals, can lead to magic.

A Love Letter to Film

Stunts
The film is a love letter to the unsung heroes of the industry, stunt performers. In a time when CGI and green screens dominate, The Fall Guy goes back to practical effects. Stuntmen and women are thrown, beaten, and bruised for our entertainment, often without the recognition they deserve (nod within the film about absent Oscar’s). This film embraces that reality, choosing to use real stunts instead of relying on computer-generated shortcuts. It’s a refreshing nod to the grit and determination of stunt performers, who rarely get the spotlight they deserve, and often self referenced in the film by characters and its story. It’s watching a tribute to the very craft that makes action films so thrilling, with the stuntman hero leading the way. And then, of course, there’s the broken breakaway glass within the hoodie gag, a perfect metaphor for the film’s blend of grit and style, as well as a playful nod to the audience.

Beautiful Chaos
The making of a film is, in many ways, a chaotic mess. The film (the fall guy) captures this beautifully (with the film within a film), demonstrating how everything that happens on set, from missed shots to last-minute changes, ends up as part of the final product. The blooper-like moments within the movie, actors improvising, cameras malfunctioning, pyrotechnics gone awry—are all part of the fun. The process of making a movie is rarely as smooth as the final product, and The Fall Guy doesn’t shy away from showing that. The sheer shock of  the crew having to do a last minute “oner”… It’s a reminder of how much work, frustration, and humor go into creating the magic we see on screen.

Ode to the Greats
The film is full of subtle nods to cinematic legends, while I won’t mention all of the references, I will say a few. Edgar Wright’s trademark fast, functional cuts are scattered throughout, offering a lead into moments of sharp humor and impeccable timed beats. Nora Ephron’s use of split screens in romantic scenes echoes the way she crafted emotional connections in films like Sleepless in Seattle. And the use of sunglasses reflections, slow motion hair flip glazes, callbacks (“I did that trick so many times I could do it with my hands tied behind my back”)— and other classic cinematic tropes, adds depth to key moments, and play so much to the audience, we are in on the fun. These references aren’t just homages; they’re the director’s way of showing that he not only understands the language of film, but adores it. And in doing so, he elevates The Fall Guy into something more than just a fun action flick, it becomes an ode to the very art of entertainment and filmmaking.

Music
This is a rock ‘n roll epic, and the soundtrack pulses with life. The music doesn’t just complement the scenes; it elevates them. It brings a raw, unfiltered energy to the film that matches its chaotic beauty. In a world where scores often feel like an afterthought (unless you are Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott etc), The Fall Guy lets the juke box music drive its emotional beats, reminding us just how powerful and fun a great soundtrack can be if used correctly.

Gags
Running gags throughout the film. Almost too many to count. Which quite honestly makes the bar pretty high… however I am speaking about none other than Ryan Gosling’s character never gets a cup of coffee… 


The Fall Guy is a rare breed of film, a thrilling, action-packed romp that’s just so much better, smarter and more self-aware than it first appears. It’s a celebration of movies, the crew, the hard work, its movie stars, and the beautiful chaos that comes with making a film. It’s a love letter to everything that makes cinema magical: the characters, the stunts, the directors, the actors, the crew (again) and yes, even the tropes. I’d hazard this movie will live on, not just as a cult classic, but as a testament to why we keep coming back to the theatre, even if we didn’t go see it in droves the first time.",3,1737296560.0,moviereviews,2,1.0,False

(Sage/Breville Bambino + Eureka Mignon Manuale),"Hello, I have some problems with my new setup and I can't really tell what I'm doing wrong. I found the 0 point on my grinder (where the burrs touch) and moved the dial around 2 - 3 steps counter-clockwise (tried multiple settings). I use around 14-16 grams of coffee for a double shot. If I start the counter when I hit the double shot button on the Bambino, the first drop of coffee comes out after 13-15 seconds (without coffee it takes around 10 for the first drop) and I get around 30 grams of coffee in 23-25 seconds. Tried with both fresh and older roasted coffee but the shots are always bitter, with a bad taste and smell.

Does that mean she actually wants me to schedule a date or is just driving this out until I give up?

We're both in college so I'm very new to the dating scene. I met a girl over Instagram and eventually got to asking if she'd like to meet up in person for coffee. (This would be our first time meeting in person) 

She agreed and I suggested Saturday. She then said she can't do Saturday because she goes home on the weekends and apologized. I then asked when she was free and she said ""pretty much during the week I'm free"" she then gave me her work schedule and I know she has her classes in the morning, because she told me before.

So Idk does she actually want me to schedule this date or does she not want to and feel pressured into giving me stuff, like schedules and such?

I wasn't trying to be forceful I kinda suggested everything and some stuff like the schedule she just gave in response to me asking when you're free.
So is that's a good sign?",0,1737296495.0,dating_advice,3,0.33,False

Self Serve Non-Adoption Cat cat So, I'm a self proclaimed cat lady and I have an idea. What if there was a cat cafe that was self serve? I'm not looking to adopt my cats out, you see. Theyre my babies. But I've always loved being able to sit with a cup of coffee and watch their antics. What if others like to do this too? You come in, have a cup of coffee and be entertained by the fluffy cuteness that are cats. Maybe read a book too, as I'm an avid reader myself - that is until a little furry butt plops on your book demanding attention!

That said, I can bring the cats to the idea. But I don't have a location, nor the money to do it on my own. If anyone participates it would have to be locally and they'd have to accept that my word is law regarding my little ones.

My idea is simple, albeit slightly complex. A cat cafe, a book store, a coffee house. Maybe enlven a place so sell cat supplies like treats, toys and clothing - if you can keep it on your cat that is!

So, anyone who has advice is welcome to comment. Don't hate and please don't steal ideas. Anyone wanting to participate, please comment. I think this could be a real great business model that others could utilize.

For me though, I'll be honest. I love my cats. I love books. I love coffee and I love food. Combining these seems like a hermits paradise.",1,1737296442.0,CatCafe,0,1.0,False

Hello! First things first, I’m a 25-year-old male, so please be 21+. This is my first time posting an ad of my own (but I’ve got about 10 years of experience), so bear with me. 

I typically lean towards more slice of life, romance roles, as that’s just what I’m most comfortable writing! I’ve never dabbled in fantasy or sci-fi and don’t really intend to start now. I’m fairly literate, usually writing around 3 paragraphs, but I can always stretch that out if it requires more detail. In any dialogue-heavy moments, lesser might be more, to not drag it out.

I’m in PST, if that matters, but I don’t mind what your  time zone is! My availability is pretty flexible, thanks to my job not having concrete hours. I’m a lot more online later in the afternoon and evening, around 4pm-11pm PST, but I check in throughout the day and if work allows, can always send a response!

Now for my ideas (they’re more like rough outlines) - my character is A, your character is B

1. Muse A has recently moved into town after opening a small bookstore/coffee house with his sister. Muse B lives in the neighboring townhouse, and due to events in her past, she's spent the last two years locked and hidden away in her home. Given that they share an entryway, the two met the day he moved in after his brother-in-law propped a mattress up against her door, blocking her view through her peephole. This drove her to open the door to see what was going on, and the two briefly met. Muse A was taken with Muse B just upon exchanging a few quick words, but the same couldn't be said for her. He was more outgoing than she was, and very intent on getting to know her. From bringing over mail that was mistakenly delivered to his address, to dropping off books and pastries on her doorstep, he tries everything he can think of to try and strike up a conversation, not knowing exactly what her struggles are. (I hope to have the two characters eventually start to form a friendship, and then eventually a relationship. Fairly angsty, slow burn and all that.)

2. Muse A and Muse B are both doctors at Boston General Hospital (what kind of doctor is up to you). They met a few years ago when B first started, and for the last year or so have been having an affair. (A would be the one that’s married, with B being a couple years younger than A). To make things simple for themselves, they made some ground rules. There are five, simple and clear, that define their relationship: 1) Be professional at work. 2) Keep it secret. 3) Don’t get attached. 4) Meet only at her apartment. 5) No sleepovers. They agreed not to break any of them, but rules 3 and 5 had been getting harder to follow. Muse B was getting more and more attached to Muse A, and it seemed that he was struggling to follow that rule as well. (This one is very rough, and more of a general idea but we can decide how things play out together. Again, angsty, slow burn and drama-filled.)

If either of these caught your attention, feel free to send me a DM or a chat! Being that it’s the weekend, I may be a little busier than usual but I should see all messages fairly quickly!

1i4z9sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i4z9sm/stop_me_from_getting_a_meraki_1650/,Stop me from getting a Meraki [1650€],"I currentely own a Sage Oracle Jet. Got it for dead cheap. Unfortunately while i love the general machine, the automatic dosing just gets the best of me too often. Every now and then its off, the tamping fails especially with precision baskets and the dose generally is super rough to get below 20g even with lowering the tamper and smaller baskets.

Luckily i got the machine cheap enough to sell it for the same price (or slightly more) and now am thinking what else to get instead. I would love to keep some of the comfort features and actually still in my mind somewhat prefer an all in one machine. I especially dont want something like a Bambino because while i csn see it giving me great results the feel you get while making coffee is a huge point. I looked at machines at a local tech store and these small machines just dont feel right to me. 

Now looking at the Meraki it seems utterly perfect for me. Super fast heat up (which is a must for me, anything above 10min wont work personally), grind and brew by weight, dual boiler as i often do milk drinks and extra comfort stuff like the temperature sensor in the steam wand. Even the grinder seems pretty good for such a machine. I still kinda fear that this wont hold up to the expectations so i would love to hear comparisons for a setup at roughly 1650€ which would come as close to this as possible.
