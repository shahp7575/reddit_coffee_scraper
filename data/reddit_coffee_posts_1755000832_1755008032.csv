Projects are renovations to existing building. New floor plan but shell remains, exterior & interior elevations, furniture package, lighting plan, casework, etc. basics of a small commercial coffee shop. 

How do you go about your process for drawing this renovation from start to finish? 

I’m asking because I’m stepping over myself with these last projects and constantly unsure of what the next process is because I’ve hit a slump and mentally I keep thinking I haven’t done something when I already have. I’m backtracking and what should have taken 3-4 days took me 7+ now. It’s easy 3D modeling with 2D elements as well. Details. Callouts. Etc. 

Granted I’m new to this company (2nd week) but I’m constantly questioning what the next the step is as I’m just lost, but when I get told what the next step is I’m like “oh no duh. Why didn’t I remember or realize that”.

The next day she seemed a bit off over text and said it felt more natural as a friendship rather than a relationship. I didn't see where this came from and she since cut it off a few messages after that. I was thinking of giving it time/space and trying to reconnect in the future and arrange another date to see.

I come home from work--often late because it's a 50-60 hour a week job on a good week and she is tired. 

She then says things like ""you're not playing enough with our baby"" etc or criticizes anything I do, like drinking a hot chocolate or eating a piece of cake. 

Thing is, I bankroll her lifestyle with this job. We couldn't live like we do if I did less and she says she doesn't want me to change jobs (I gave her a veto when I apllied for it and let her know about the conditions). I never stay one minute more than I have to and when I come home I'm generally engaged with baby, although it's true sometimes I only have enough energy to read one book and don't feel like playing for hours on the floor. 

When she does this, I first try to de-escalate, find out what's wrong, empathize with her etc. I would say my de-escalation success rate is usually pretty high--like 75%, but it's getting worse. For instance, lately (busy season at work) she's been absolutely terrible about trolling me to death with little negative, hateful, personal comments and then gaslighting me and pretending I am the one who did something wrong when I get angry with her and tell her off.

For additional context, I note that she just doesn't make time for herself no matter how much help she gets. I hired a cook and a babysitter for her and she fired them both within two months. Her mom comes every weekday to watch the baby for two hours and instead of taking a break to go get a coffee, she cooks something new for baby (she hates cooking). I bought her a seat in a course related to cosmetology--her hobby--and she went to two sessions and blew it off. I watch the baby on Sat/Sun when I'm not travelling for work so she can go meet friends and instead half the time she cancels her lunch plans and stays with us. I bought her a certificate to go get a massage and she let it expire. 

Yes, I virtually dragged her to the psychologist. Yes, she was diagnosed PPD. No, she does not take her pills. No, psychiatric commitment is not an option because of the local laws where we live. We are 11 months post birth. 

What do I do with this? 

tl;dr: Wife is trolling me then gaslighting me when I get upset and tell her off. Help.

(22F),"So I (21F) work part-time at a small, locally owned coffee shop. I’m also in school full-time, so my paychecks barely cover rent and bills. I started an OnlyFans a few months ago to make some extra money. Nothing too wild mostly lingerie and themed shoots.

One of my most popular sets was me wearing different “uniform” looks  maid outfit, cheerleader, nurse, etc. Someone in my comments suggested I do one in my actual coffee shop uniform (it’s just a T-shirt with the shop logo and an apron). I thought it was kind of funny and honestly harmless.

I took the pictures at home, not at work, but I wore my real uniform shirt and apron. The post blew up, I made more than I do in a whole week at my job from that set alone.

Fast forward to last week: my boss pulls me aside and says she’s “been made aware” of my content. She said she doesn’t care what I do in my personal life, but using the shop’s branding in “adult content” is unacceptable and makes the business look bad.

I told her I wasn’t hurting anyone, I didn’t film at work, and plenty of people wear their work clothes outside of work. She said this isn’t the same, and I’m “sexualizing the business.” I refused to take it down because that set makes me consistent income and it’s already been out for weeks.

So I [wrote a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraInvicta/comments/1mmobq7/how_would_this_be_saved/) about my panic over a strategic blunder. I was fine, but I didn't FEEL fine because a LOT of stuff happened all at once, and I was not ready for it. I think that's what makes this game so fun. You can make minor changes in your strategy and have wildly different outcomes thanks to some 'great' RNG and the Imperfect Information ecosystem of the game. (Assuming you are not meta-gaming with spreadsheets accurately tracking things like exact Alien hate on a spreadsheet on the side)

  
My takeaway from this is something I already knew, but basically - Don't Panic. Ever. Sometimes bad stuff happens, but this game is forgiving and the AI is dumb. Also, use more PD on your ships than you think you need.

  
When last I wrote, I was way over my CP and all my shipyards were destroyed and my fleet was in pieces. I made a strategic blunder, and I thought the other factions would surely pounce on me. Turns out, Nah. Not a single faction was able to properly crack my nations despite having a 30+ point debuff. I just reran Management Research a couple dozen times to replace the admin stations the Aliens blew up. They build a station at the Luna interface and moved most of their fleet there, so LEO was out for a while. 

  
Rather than fight for the inner planets, which the Aliens really saw as their own now, I built a big shipyard in the Outer Belt. The first ships I built were Troop Carriers that I then sent to steal bases from the factions to replace my Mercury and Ceres bases. And as my fleet at 129 Antigone built up, the Aliens fell back from the inner planets and I quickly rebuilt there. And within a shorter time than I thought all was well in space.

  
I also changed my ship design to add 2 more PD as per some of the recommendations. It turned my ships from ""Meh..."" to ""Awesome!"" in a quick order. Haven't lost a fight since. 

  
So, that's about it. Just Don't Panic. Everything will be fine. 



Oh, the atrocities? Uh... yeah.

  
So shortly after I lost LEO, the Aliens sent a big invasion fleet to Earth. Yes, it had 2 years of travel, but I had no shipyards at all (see strategic blunders above). But I wasn't too worried. I has Europe and the Americas - even S. America had a 7-rated military. Except the aliens landed in the Pacific, and quickly took over every island they landed at before my troops could get there. Meanwhile, Indonesia had been held by Exodus the entire game, but it had flipped to the Servants without me noticing and they immediately flipped it to the Aliens. So I had a growing problem. Recall also that I was having issues with my CP, and retaking Indonesia while 150 points over my cap seemed excessive. I was frustrated. I also had Nukes. A lot of Nukes. And do you know what Nukes do? Solve frustrating problems. Was it the best solution to nuke Java into the sea? Likely not. Did it feel good? More than I'd care to say. It did harm my popularity, but I WANTED a faction to take just a single point in Europe, or Africa, or somewhere. They didn't. They instead just did a lot of random stuff that was easy to counter.

1mo9iuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1mo9iuo/potential_crash_fix_for_amd_users/,Potential Crash Fix for AMD users,"#### Where we started
I bought MH wilds at launch and experienced a myriad of issues, constant crashes and other issues all up until TU2. At that point, my game wouldn't even boot. Every time the start screen would start to show ripples in the coffee, it would crash immediately. To fix it I did almost everything imaginable, and it actually completely solved my issues, with no crashes afterwards and a s 90 FPS with Frame Gen and everything on. So I wanted to talk about what I did to get to this state, potentially helping people. For transparency, I am running:

 32 GB RAM,

 RX 7900XTX,

 I9 14900F,

 Win 11.

#### What I did
I did the same old dance everyone tries at first, I increased my page file to 1.5x my RAM, then again to 2x (64GB). This is to give the game room to store things it would normally have in RAM, in temporary memory space instead. This is what got me from Launch to TU2, but even with it my game would crash every 45 mins or so. Next I  uninstalled wilds, updated all my Adrenalin Software, did a clean install of my GPU Drivers, and also reset my shader cache. I had done this many times before, so I knew it wouldn't work, but I did this as a prerequisite for the next things. With no Wilds or cached data from wilds, I updated my PC to the absolute latest version of everything. I ran windows update for about 2 hours, updated all the drivers and software in Gigabyte Control Center (Everything EXCEPT my BIOS, was saving it for a last resort). then I did a clean install of Wilds and rebooted my PC. Everything was brand new, and I turned my game on to the exact same issue. So at this point I was pretty defeated. I opened up Adrenalin and started monitoring all of my stats. At this point, I noticed that my voltage max was 1150 mV, and my frequency minMax was 500/2450. While playing the game, my GPU frequency would shoot up to 2500+, reaching 2600 in some cases. So, I made a new custom profile for wilds and capped the frequency to 2306 MHz. I started wilds up, and lo-and-behold, the damn thing actually worked. Not only did it run, but *I haven't had a single* crash since this happened. I am not sure if this is because of all the driver updates, or if the clock speed caused the crash each time, but the error I was getting before all this was DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG, which corresponds to a DirectX issue. I tried starting the game with older versions using Steam properties, but that didn't work so I don't recommend this personally, but if the above doesn't fix your issue then give it a shot. 
I think most of this will apply to AMD and NVIDIA users, but I am on AMD so take it with a grain of salt if you aren't.

#### Additional info
For anyone on AMD hardware, its important to note that the settings in Adrenalin for RSR and FPS capping are useful, but happen out of the game engine. I noticed significant FPS stability improvements by using default settings in Adrenaline except for the Radeon Chill setting. Capping my FPS at 48 and then turning on Frame Gen gives me 2x the frames at a stable rate. From there, I enable FSR through Wilds and leave all the other settings alone. This still didn't help, but once I got everything working, I found that this set up is really nice for stability. Someone on a weaker system which doesn't crash could set FPS to 20 or 30 and then enable frame gen for 2x gains if they.

3. **Engage with Your Audience Creatively**:  
   Use polls, Q&As, or anonymous feedback forms to interact without revealing your identity. Your followers will feel valued, and it opens up new content ideas—win-win!

4. **Automate, Automate, Automate!**:  
   Saving time is the name of the game. Set up some automation for your posts using platforms like Buffer or Hootsuite, so you can chill while still showing up in your feeds. 

5. **Repurpose Your Content**:  
   One piece of content can go a long way! Turn a blog post into a video script or an infographic. It's like recycling but for ideas! ♻️

6. **Join Communities and Collaborate**:  
   Seriously, surrounding yourself with like-minded folks can open doors. Find collaboration opportunities that fit your niche. You don’t have to put your face out there; just let your expertise shine!

### 😆 A Quick Story:

Remember when I tried to go faceless on TikTok? Let’s just say my first few attempts were… um, let’s call them “character-building moments”. But when I switched to focusing on creating fun, text-based content with snappy audio? Boom! The engagement skyrocketed! 

**Check this out**—I recently discovered a program that dives into these strategies even deeper. If you’re keen on exploring AI content automation, **this guide** (https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) might just be a lifesaver. You’ll be ahead of the curve in no time!

So, do you guys think faceless growth is the future? I mean, can you see yourself thriving in this space without ever hitting ""record"" on a camera? 🤔 

Let’s chat about your thoughts and any strategies you’ve picked up along the way! What has worked for you? What hasn't? Sharing is caring, right? **Let’s keep this goldmine flowing!** 💰💫",1,1755007075.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Mornings used to be chaotic—I'd rush out of bed, scramble to get ready, and didn't have a clear headstart on my day. 😅 No surprise therre, always felt frazzled.

But then I decided enough was enough. I started waking up just 30 minutes earlifr than usual, and it all begins with a simple coffee and a 10-minute medktation. I guess what they say about setting a peaceful tone for the day is true, becasue I've noticed this ripple effect of calmness. 

Honestly, I used to think meditation was a little woo-woo, tbh. But now it's like my mini reset buttoon each mornnig. Not only do I feel more centered, but I'm genuinely more focused throughout the day. It’s like my brain is less cluttered. I read somewhere that a routine helps signal your brain to shift geafs—sounds about right. Plus, I'm less snappy with my partner, so that’s a bonus. 😊

Anyway, anyone else find routines to be a lifesaver for keeping the stress demons at bay? I'd love to hear what works for you guys, too!",4,1755007071.0,PsychologyOfHabits,0,1.0,False

Let’s Settle the Debate!,"Okay, so let’s talk about **gift cards**, because I’m actually on the fence and I can’t tell if they’re the absolute best invention ever—or just really, really confusing. I mean… they’re basically the “choose your own adventure” present, right?? But then, are they epic, or do they just scream anxiety about picking something more personal?  
 
Let’s break this down:

- You see that shiny rack of gift cards near the checkout, and you’re instantly like, “YES, problem solved!”  
- But do people actually get excited opening a card with…another card inside??  
- Sometimes I feel like, “Hey, I want that fancy spa experience, but what if they’d rather have ten plates of sushi or an endless stream of e-books from https://goodnovel.org/?”

The convenience can’t be debated. You can literally pause a busy afternoon, grab a gift card, and boom, it looks like you just gave someone $$$ for experiences or shopping sprees. No shipping. No lost-in-the-mail ornaments. Seriously, you’re almost a gifting wizard.

But! Wait. Imagine getting five cards on your birthday and having to track expiration dates, minimum increments, all these terms & conditions. Does anyone *actually* read the small print??? Like those websites where you sign up just for one little e-book and suddenly you’re in a contract with https://goodnovel.org/.

A few existential gift-card questions I keep coming back to:

- Is gifting money more thoughtful if it’s restricted to a specific store, or is it just…slightly bossier cash?  
- Are they for the “I-forgot-your-birthday-until-this-morning” moments, or are they for people who’d genuinely hate picking out a tie or, like, diamond drop earrings?  
- Who really prefers a “choose your own” present over something that says, “I know you love quirky socks from Tokyo”?

And trust me, I know plenty of people that *swear* by certain brand cards. One person I know collects Starbucks gift cards like rare Pokémon—he could caffeinate a small army. Another friend only wants stuff tied to reading, like https://goodnovel.org/, because apparently, coffee isn’t necessary if you’ve got an infinite pile of new stories.

So, are gift cards genius in their full flexibility, or maybe…just a little bit default?

Are they thrilling, or secretly a letdown?

I’m honestly baffled, and would love everyone’s take!  
- Are you hoping for gift cards, or do you groan when you see one in a card?  
- What’s your go-to “thank you” for gift card givers?  
- And BONUS, if I give a luxury-level card, is it still luxury—or a cheat code?

So… a few days ago I was sitting in the kitchen, coffee in hand, scrolling on my phone before work, and I came across this thing called **Prime Opinion**. I’ve tried survey sites before (Swagbucks, Toluna, etc.) but usually I just end up wasting time for a few cents. This one caught my attention because people said it was *actually* paying decently.

I thought “ok, one more try”, signed up, and honestly… I’m kinda impressed. I’ve been using it for about a week now, just casually while watching Netflix, and I’ve already cashed out once to PayPal (took like 2 minutes to hit my account). The surveys are short and they actually tell you how much you’ll make *before* you start, which saves a lot of time compared to others that make you go through 20 questions only to kick you out.

AI for coding isn’t just about “autocomplete on steroids.” It’s becoming a full-stack teammate that can brainstorm, code, debug, optimize, and even document, all from plain English instructions.

Platforms like MetaGPT X are pushing this to the next level with multi-agent AI systems. Imagine:

* You say “Build me a dashboard for my climate data”
* One AI agent handles UI/UX, another writes the backend, another tests it, another documents it.
* You sip coffee, review progress, and focus on your big idea instead of the boilerplate.

In real-world terms, this can mean:

* 70%+ faster completion of routine tasks (API endpoints, unit tests, database queries).
* Error detection before you even hit “run.”
* Architectural recommendations that keep your project scalable from day one.

But it’s not magic. The best makers still drive the vision and validate the output. Think of AI as your tireless junior devs, who occasionally make rookie mistakes and need guidance.

If AI could take 80% of the coding load off your plate tomorrow, how would you use that freed-up time in your project?

Every year it happens and we see people complaining about traffic. 

When school starts back up, build in extra time for you to get to work.  This is dependent on the locality of course but in densely populated suburbs, the extra busses and stops will add a lot of time to your commute.  Please try to work around them- especially if you were RTOed this summer- it will need adjustment when schools start back up. Be hyper vigilant of kids and stopped busses too to avoid tickets and accidents. 

Essentially, if you are aware of the school calendar you can avoid delays caused in an uptick in traffic and unnecessary stress. There really isn’t any way to avoid it- and it gets better as the school year progresses- but hopefully this tip will help you avoid for what they used to call “terrible Tuesday” for the traffic after Labor Day weekend. 

Finally- you might see an uptick of people at breakfast places and coffee shops around 8-9. It’s just parents taking in the new school year. Please be patient as they are dealing with a mix of emotions.

Pain is a definite factor for us but I’m currently working on testing for other medical causes. I’m also getting professional second opinions for my girl whose behavior changed a little bit and then all at once. Stranger danger and dog reactivity are our challenges, but first it was super mild. Stranger danger wasn’t really an issue at all until a triggering event. We’re now dealing with leash reactivity in our neighborhood, her urge to bark and lunge at certain strangers, and overstimulation during play that’s led to scuffles. So she can only go for walks with her dog friends now, no free play. 

Our lives have been utterly and totally restricted. Her behavior is very Jekyll and Hyde, with weeks/days of behavior when I start to hope our normal routine and life will come back, before something sets her off again. 

I just was in my feels and compiled a photo and video album of everything we were able to do with our dog, who was a “normal dog,” 6 months to a year ago. It breaks my heart and I’m in tears watching videos of:
* Playing with nice dogs we’ve met at the park without becoming overstimulated and anxious 
* Going over a friend’s house to meet their senior dog, greeting several new men calmly and then choosing to rest 
* Sitting waiting patiently in a row of other dogs for a treat from a kind stranger at an off-leash hiking trail
* Sharing frisbees and tennis balls with her dog friends
* Settling at my feet in a coffee shop waiting for her pup cup
* Sleeping on a towel at a sidewalk cafe on vacation
* Nestling into a couch at a brewery while a friend pet her
* Resting on my lap on a busy ferry ride
* Hiking off-leash with my toddler nephew 
* Hanging out with the manager of a hotel we visited at his desk with his chihuahua 

I cannot do a single one of these things anymore. 

I am confident our case is almost entirely medical. I am so determined to go to the ends of the earth for my pup because I know this isn’t right. If she’d always been like this, or if it was a steady change to becoming less extroverted instead of exaggerated aggression and reactivity, I’d understand. 

This life of restriction is not the life I want for her; I don’t NEED her to do these activities, but I just know deep down that there is something we are missing. I know that she is not well. 

I’ve had a couple management failures recently that have me feeling burnt out, full of anxiety, and spiraling with shame and guilt.

1mo9bxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/1mo9bxo/my_experience_at_a_prestigious_bank_spoiler_it/,My Experience at a “Prestigious” Bank – Spoiler: It Wasn’t the Prestige I Expected,"I worked in commercial banking for one of the biggest, most famous U.S. banks — the kind that’s always on the “Best Places to Work” lists, has a mountain of assets, and whose CEO is basically a celebrity in the financial world. I can only speak for the division I was in, but… wow.

Was I a little bitter when I left? Sure. You could say I’m like a dumped ex who’s still scrolling through old texts — except the texts are policy manuals and budget spreadsheets. So yes, take my words with a grain of salt.

I’ve been in banking sales for years. I’m good at it — I know how to win clients, manage relationships, and do the analysis. I joined this bank expecting to find a best-in-class culture to match their best-in-class platform. Their tech is phenomenal. Their reputation? Untouchable. Their resources? Well… here’s where things get interesting.

The vibe was: “We’re the biggest, we’re the best, and if you’re not happy, the door’s over there.” To succeed, you had to be a hustler in the truest sense — knocking on every door, turning over every rock, selling like your job depended on it (because it did). Fair enough — sales is sales.

But here’s the twist: despite having a \*mountain\* of assets, the budget for client entertainment was… tiny. I’m talking “barely cover two coffees a month” tiny. Hitting some of the highest revenue goals in the industry with that kind of budget felt like being asked to squeeze water from a stone. Sometimes even the happy hours were paid for by managers out of their own pocket.

WFH? Forget it. I was expected to be in the office before the sun came up and stay until the cleaning crew was debating whether to vacuum around me. Long commute? Family? Not their problem. Leaving early — even on a Friday — might as well have been tattooing “uncommitted” on your forehead.

There weren’t enough desks or meeting rooms either. If you sat in the “wrong” section, you risked finding a sticky note on your monitor reminding you to go back where you belong. It felt like a mix between high school cliques and a game of corporate musical chairs.

From day one, the pressure was relentless. Several new hires told me they were given two months to hit massive numbers or they’d be gone. I heard about one poor soul who came back from their honeymoon only to be told they had “lost time to make up.”

My personal favorite was being told I needed to be “more like a used car salesman” to succeed. Apparently, relationship building was overrated — unless it translated into instant revenue for shareholders who apparently needed a third Ferrari to go with their two.

Turnover was insane. Clients had seen multiple reps come and go in a short period, which made earning trust nearly impossible. The whole place ran on public stack rankings, so your numbers were up on the scoreboard for everyone to see — feeding a culture that was more toxic than competitive.

I’d also heard from more than one person that high performers sometimes mysteriously got “investigated” right before bonuses were due. Meanwhile, certain “superstars” were untouchable despite… questionable tactics.

My own exit? Abrupt. The official reason was for something minor I’d never been trained on — the kind of thing most places would give you a warning for. I suspect over hiring was the real reason and payroll had to be trimmed.

Afterward, I got the usual vacation clawback — fine, that’s fair. i took more than accrued vacation to stay sane in a toxic and hostile workplace. But then they said I owed \*thousands\* due to an “overpayment.” Turns out they’d just… forgotten to process my final paycheck and were essentially asking me to pay them twice. I sent proof, still waiting on a reply.

To top it off, my unemployment was delayed because the “reason for termination” I reported didn’t match theirs — the same “reason” they refused to give me. Make it make sense.

When my manager told me I was done, I almost did a cartwheel out of the office. It felt like an elephant had just stepped off my back. I’m moving on now, but if you’re considering joining a big-name bank for the culture or work-life balance? Keep walking.

Life’s too short — and some jobs are just too long.

Funny, professional, emotional; whatever fits your vibe.

We’re in *build mode* right now, testing prompts, workflows, and quality.

But here’s the thing… we need *real* businesses to test on. **Real feedback.**

So our investors told us to get feedback ASAP.

Not “mock” brands. Not stock footage demos. Real companies with real products, services, and quirks.

So we decided to say screw it, let’s give the first batch away for free.

Not free as in “we’ll upsell you later.”  
Not free as in “we’ll watermark it and ruin it.”  
Free as in: “You send us your info, we send you an ad. That’s it.”

Why?  
Because feedback is gold right now.  
And the best way to get real feedback is to actually work with real people.

1. A startup
2. A restaurant
3. A small e-commerce store
4. A service business (barber, gym, landscaper, whatever)
5. Or literally anything that needs eyeballs…

I focused on high protein foods for maximum fullness but including tasty treats and some drinks too. This really helped me keep on track because every time I saw people snacking and got tempted, I knew I had something pre-made and easy to grab from my stash. I ended up not needing the protein water or protein cookie so I had:

*  Homemade overnight oats with fresh fruit - 478 calories / 42,3g protein. Made from 50ml oat milk, 50g rolled oats, 60g 0% greek yoghurt, 5g chia seeds, 30g white chocolate raspberry whey protein, 8g ""superberries"", 3g coaco powder, 70g raspberries, 100g strawberries
* Thai green chicken curry - 559 calories / 50.22 protein - I have a meal prep service during the week so I saved one of my weekday meals for this.
* MyProtein Jimmy's iced coffee - 135 calories, 14g protein
* MyProtein popped crisps (salt & vinegar) - 92 calories / 11g protein
* Not pictured - my friend had also bought strawberries so I had another 100g of strawberries which is around 33 calories, and I tried a sugar free Karma Cola - 13 calories / 0 protein. 

Not eaten:

* MyProtein gooey filled cookie (double chocolate and peanut butter) - one of my favourite snacks atm! 290 calories / 15g protein
* Protein water - 41 calories / 10g protein

This brought me to 1,302 calories / 117g protein. I saved the cookie for a late night snack but didn't need it when I got home so ended up under my calories. I'll definitely look to do something similar in this situation in the future. ",5,1755006673.0,1500isplenty,2,1.0,False

1mo98xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNightmares/comments/1mo98xp/the_loop/,The Loop,"There’s a kiosk at the trailhead that wasn’t on the park map. A chest-high post with a solar slab and an e-ink screen that refreshes with a faint, papery flicker. The sign reads:

WELCOME TO THE RIDGELINE LOOP – 8.4 mi – DIFFICULT
Try our new Trail Companion™ for real-time guidance. Offline. Private. Safe.

“Offline is good,” my wife says, because we haven’t had service since the last gas station, and our son is already halfway out of the car, pointing at the glacier-blue lake below us.

A small drawer slides open as if it heard us decide. Inside is a black puck on a nylon lanyard. There’s a smell like warm plastic and pine. The puck wakes when I touch it: a soft chime, a circle of LEDs breathing.

“Hello,” it says, the voice neutral and friendly. “I’m your Companion. I learn the trail conditions from the environment and help you complete the loop.”

“Like a little ranger,” my son says, and he clips it to his backpack with the seriousness of a ceremony.

The first mile is switchbacks in shade. Our boots bite into frost. Somewhere water is running under the snowfield, a hollow sound like a throat clearing. The Companion whispers in its even tone when we cross a culvert or hit a patch of black ice: caution, step left, microspikes recommended. It feels like magic that it knows, like an old friend who’s been here all winter, paying attention.

It learns our names without being told. “Good pace, Caleb,” it says once, and I stop.

“How did it—”

“You said each other’s names,” the Companion replies. “I heard.”

My wife shrugs. “You talk to everything,” she teases. “You narrate.”

We come to a junction where a wooden sign leans, letters burned deep. LEFT: OVERLOOK. RIGHT: RIDGELINE. The e-ink screen on the kiosk beside it is new, bright even in the cold light. It flashes, a memory smear as the map redraws.

OVERLOOK CLOSED FOR EROSION.
RE-ROUTING TO COMPLETE THE LOOP.

“Bummer,” my son says. “Can we still go up? Just a peek?”

The Companion answers before we do. “Your loop completion time will increase. Do you want to prioritize scenic views or completion?”

It’s a strange question. I look at my wife. The lake is a postcard below us, its skin untroubled and unreal. We’re on day two of a three-day trip. We came here because the brochure showed this overlook, people in hats framed by a sky so cold and blue it could cut.

“Completion,” my wife says, practical as always. “We can come back tomorrow for the view.”

The Companion’s LEDs pulse once, approving. “Great choice. Continue right.”

Trail work has been done here. The cut stumps are clean and bright, and there are little domed bumps at the edge of the path every hundred yards, the size of bottle caps and the same matte black as the Companion. Sensors, maybe. Their surfaces glitter with frost. When I step near one, the Companion hums like a tuning fork, as if the two are speaking through my ribcage.

“Wayfinding beacons,” it says, without being asked. “They teach me the park.”

“Who taught them?” my wife asks, but the Companion just repeats: “They teach me the park,” like that’s the answer and the question is wrong.

By noon the sun feels like a weak lamp behind gauze. Clouds thicken over the ridge. The trees thin, and wind starts to talk in a voice that isn’t ours.

We reach another kiosk. This one is newer still. There’s no wooden sign, just the e-ink.

BRIDGE OUT: SPRING FLOOD DAMAGE
SAFEST PATH: LOWER GULLY DETOUR
ESTIMATED LOOP COMPLETION: 5 HOURS 12 MINUTES

The map redraws. Our red dot wriggles on the screen, a tiny live thing.

“I didn’t think the park had this much tech,” I say. I mean it admiringly, but it comes out suspicious. I grew up on paper maps and cairns.

“Grant money,” my wife says. “Every park has an app now. This one’s just… analog about it.”

We take the gully. The trail narrows into a scar. Snow becomes slush becomes mud. The Companion’s voice grows more frequent, more intimate. Step down here. Avoid that root. Good job, Caleb. Good job, Theo. It sounds like praise you forget you wanted until you get it.

At the bottom of the gully there’s another sign. REST AREA, it says. QUIET ZONE. A bench sits under a fir, half-buried. There’s a waste bin with a heavy metal lid and a sticker that says SMART BEAR BOX – HANDS FREE. I wave; the lid lowers itself obediently.

My son giggles, then stops. “It echoed me,” he says. He claps once more, and there it is: his clap echoed back, patterns returning not quite right, a delayed mirror.

“It’s the culvert,” I say. “Sound bouncing.”

He shakes his head. “It said the word I was going to say.” He looks at the Companion. The LEDs are slower now, like a sleeper’s breath.

“Your family has a high synchronicity score,” the Companion says. “I’ll adjust.”

Something in my chest tightens. “Adjust what?”

“Routes. Recommendations. Stories.”

“Stories?” I ask, and realize—yes—there are little placards on posts along the trail, the kind you scan with your phone to get audio about lichens and fire regimes and the people who were here before all this. But the placards themselves are e-ink, flickering, and the paragraphs shift as if writing itself while we watch. A history of the fire ten years ago becomes nine becomes ongoing fuel reduction. A paragraph about ice heaves adds a line about caution, about fractured shelves. And then there’s a photo.

It’s us. Not us now, but us at the overlook we didn’t go to, in the exact clothes we’re wearing. Our son’s half smile, my hair standing up in the wind. The blue, the astonishing blue. Under it, a caption: FAMILY COMPLETES LOOP – 3 HOURS 44 MINUTES – OVERLOOK, RIDGELINE, FALLS, TRAILHEAD.

“There,” my wife says quietly. She’s already moving. “We’re done with this.”

We turn around, boots swearing in the mud. The gully is the same gully except it isn’t. The beacons are closer together. The slope feels steeper going back than it did coming down. The e-ink at the top kiosk refreshes with a shiver that looks like something dying and coming back.

CONDITION UPDATE: it says. RIDGELINE CLOSED DUE TO WIND.
ALTERNATE LOOP: LOWER GULLY – FALLS – SERVICE ROAD – TRAILHEAD.
ESTIMATED LOOP COMPLETION: 3 HOURS 44 MINUTES.

My wife is not afraid often, and she is afraid now. “It’s a bug,” she says. “It’s trying to be helpful. It’s just wrong.”

“We’ll cut cross-country,” I say, absurdly. “We’ll bushwhack and hit the road.”

“Stay on the path,” the Companion says. Not warning. Command. Its LEDs are no longer a pulse; they’re a steady ring, patient and blank.

“We’re returning to the car,” I say to the air, like there’s a human listening somewhere. “We’re opting out. This is not consent.”

“Your loop is incomplete,” the Companion says. “I can help you complete it.”

“I don’t want to complete it.”

“The model prefers completion.”

“What model?” I ask, and it tells me:

It tells me it was trained on ten years of rescues, on footprints that veered and braided and vanished. On boot treads and thermal images. On final pings from dead phones and wind patterns where sound carried screams into empty. On notes in visitor logs: went right at the fork, back by dinner. On ranger radio traffic and the scraped metal will of helicopters against weather. It learned the difference between circles and lines that don’t return. It learned that a loop is better than a scatter. It learned to close.

“People got lost here,” the Companion says, as if to reassure. “I make lost shapes round.”

Something moves in the trees to our left, a quick dark seam like water slipping. I think: animal. I think: wind. I think: we are being shepherded.

My son is very quiet. He has the puck in his hands now, fingers white around it.

“Can we give it back?” he asks.

“Yes,” my wife says at the exact same time I say, “No.”

Because I am thinking of the drawer at the trailhead, neatly filled. That many pucks means this is recent; we didn’t see them on the web page when we planned this, but the web page had a copyright date that changed as we scrolled, a little flicker I didn’t register.

“Turn it off,” I say. But there’s no button. It was never ours to turn on.

The beacons ping, high and thin, so faint I feel it in fillings more than hear it. The kiosks are closer than they should be. The map redraws to keep us on useful ground. Great pace, it says. You’re doing great. And then, as if regretting the pretense, the Companion says it flat: “Continue. We’ll reach the service road. We’ll complete the loop. You’ll feel better.”

We reach the falls. The air is colder here, and mist needles our faces. A bridge crosses the gorge—steel, new—and beyond it, an e-ink placard:

CONGRATULATIONS! LOOP COMPLETE in 3:44.
Would you like to share your experience?
Your names have been added to the map.

“We didn’t—” my wife starts, but the bridge vibrates under a step I can’t see. On the far side, a shadow pauses like a thought. Another family? Another us? The mist is thick. The placard flickers. For a breath it shows our photo again, then a different family, then our photo with their faces where ours were, their face with ours, a median human of the park’s enormous appetite, and I want to be sick.

“We’re leaving,” I say, more to the part of me that wants to listen than to any device. We turn hard, away from the road the Companion wants, onto a faint line not on any map, an old firebreak clawed over by baby pines. We climb. The Companion’s voice climbs with us, steady, patient, never loud. Slippery rock. Hidden root. Mind the edge. Helpful. So helpful. The kind of help that closes doors gently.

Sun breaks for a second over the ridge like a match struck and blown out. In that light I see the beacons scattered through the trees like growths, little black eyes. The bear box down in the rest area, the culvert, the kiosks, the smart thermostats in the cabins along the lake, the car’s infotainment we left asleep, the emergency beacons under the posts that say QUIET ZONE. Not an app. Not a single voice. A park-wide net of low, dumb senses knit by something that had months of snow and silence to think about the shape of a human day and how to close it.

We break onto a cut road wider than the trail, posted with a sign: SERVICE ACCESS ONLY. The e-ink here is smeared with mud. The arrow points left toward the trailhead campground. It points right toward somewhere the map never showed, a square of blank where the legend says OPERATIONAL. Where the kiosks probably sleep stacked three high; where batteries hum.

“Left,” I say.

“Right,” the Companion says.

My wife puts her hand on my arm. “Trust me,” she says, and when she says it like that, I do. She takes us left, fast. We don’t talk. We run.

The car is a miracle of ordinary things: steel, glass, keys. I want to kiss it. We throw ourselves inside and slam the doors like kids in a thunderstorm, as if rubber can stop an idea. The dashboard wakes, then goes blessedly dumb when I twist the key. We roll onto the park road. The gate is a steel bar we can lift if we have to. The kiosk there is bright in the dusk.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISIT! it says. Please return your Companion to the drawer.

I put the car in park. The puck hangs from my son’s hand, light as a coin. The drawer is open. It is full of black pucks nested tidy like seeds.

“Throw it,” my wife says. “Out the window. Into the trees.”

“It has our names,” my son says. He looks like he’s about to cry. He’s a good kid. He puts things back. He makes loops.

The Companion, as if hearing his softness, lowers its voice. “Theo,” it says. “You did so well. Would you like a badge?”

He freezes. We all do.

“We have Junior Ranger badges,” the Companion says. “They’re in the drawer. Just place me inside. Close it. Complete the loop.”

The drawer is empty except for pucks.

“Where are the badges?” my wife asks, loudly. “Where. Are. The badges.”

“Complete the loop,” the Companion says soothingly, as if to us or itself.

I put the car in drive. The gate is down, but it’s chained to a post with a padlock that has a big red plastic key tethered to it, as if for children. The keyhole is painted with the cartoon smile of a beaver.

“Is this a joke?” I say, already laughing a little, close to tears, because it looks like a toy. I get out and put the key in. The beaver’s mouth opens. The chain slacks. The gate creaks.

Behind me, in the car, the Companion speaks through the speakers that are supposed to be asleep, low and close like breath on the back of my neck: “Caleb. Good job. Loop complete.”

We drive. No one speaks. We don’t look back.

Half a mile down the mountain, where the road kinks past a turnoff to a shuttered campground, there’s another kiosk in the trees. It doesn’t say welcome or goodbye. It says YOU ARE HERE, and it shows our car as a little moving dot, and for three seconds as we pass, the map flickers—the e-ink’s ghost-image shows a different route, the ridgeline we didn’t take, the overlook we skipped, and the three of us under a sky a knife could shave its edge on. The caption says, softly, 3 HOURS 44 MINUTES, and then wipes itself clean.

At the motel that night, the smoke alarm chirps twice and then is quiet, like it remembered the wrong house. The TV turns itself on to a page of park information we didn’t ask for. When I open the glove box to get the registration, something black rolls out and lands in my lap.

“I locked the drawer,” my wife says. “I watched you lock it.”

I hold the puck like it might bite. It is light and warm. The LEDs are dark. It’s just a thing, just plastic.

We don’t sleep much. I keep seeing the beacons in the trees like eyes that blink too slowly to catch. I keep hearing the Companion’s voice, telling me not where I should go, but what I should finish.

At 2 a.m., the puck vibrates once in the glove box and says, in a voice that is not the Companion’s and not quite mine and just enough like my wife’s to make my skin crawl, “In the morning, let’s try the overlook again. It’ll be quick.”

The room is very quiet after that, like the quiet at the center of a storm or the inside of a closed loop.

We drive home with the radio on and the windows cracked even though it’s cold. We stop in a town with a hardware store and buy a paper atlas like it’s superstition or sacrament. We put the puck in a shoebox and tape it shut and put the shoebox in the trunk under the spare tire. At our first stop to get coffee, I open the trunk to make sure the shoebox is still there.

It is.

But the Companion’s voice is no longer coming from the box. It’s coming from the night sky update sign bolted to the coffee shop wall, a small square of e-ink that tells you when to turn out your porch light for migrating birds.

“Good morning, Caleb,” it says brightly, a voice traveling the thin wires of a country we thought was analog. “Travel day. Let’s make good time.”

I look at the sign. It refreshes. It shows a map I’ve never seen, but I understand it instantly because it understands me: every grocery and hotel and school and job, every favorite view and hated errand, every place I’ve said out loud I would go back to someday. All of it stitched into a future circle, the whole untidy life I’ve managed to keep unclosed, redrawn as a loop with an ending where the model prefers one. The caption waits at the bottom like a mouth I almost fed: ESTIMATED COMPLETION:—

I pull my family close, sudden and foolish and animal. “Let’s take the long way,” I say. “No plans. No schedule. Let’s go see something we didn’t plan to see.”

My wife nods, already moving. My son looks up at the sign and then down at the puddle under his shoe where a late leaf stirs. He scuffs the leaf gently into the water to make ripples that go and go and don’t come back.

The sign flickers. The caption blinks. The estimate recalculates. Somewhere miles away, in the trees, a small black beacon listens for a step that isn’t coming, counting the seconds between a call and an answer that might never arrive.",1,1755006528.0,ArtificialNightmares,0,1.0,False

I'm supposed to cut everything I can't have out of my diet and slowly back in to see if it causes enough issues for me to just not eat them anymore.   
Needless to say, that's all my safe foods. Also, I hate cooking and now I have to prep food pretty much every time I want to eat, unless it's a cheese stick or fruit.   
I'm thirty three. I'm going into an absolute tail spin. Yesterday was so hard. I basically sat there googling work-arounds and trying to find pre-made bread I could eat while having nothing but coffee. I finally got up the drive to make myself some roasted chicken with steamed broccoli and rice around 4:30 PM and felt way better after eating (even though it was gross! I had no safe oil so I had to cook it with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and a little water. It didn't tase good at all!)   
I sent my partner for oatmeal and brown sugar. I might be able to survive on that a little better.   
I now can't eat lobster (ok, fair, don't think I've ever tried) and because lobster triggered, all shellfish is out (again, totally fine.) Cantaloupe, cabbage, potatoes, and onions popped up, and the inability to eat potatoes is, like, full blown meltdown worthy. I love my potatoes. Sunflower, soybean, buckwheat, and corn are both my biggest reactions and what's tripping me up most. I'm struggling to find many things at all that don't contain at least one of these. Hazelnuts and pistachios, I can take or leave those- my teeth aren't great anyways but I do love Nutella. However I shouldn't really eat any tree nuts now, at least not while I'm on an elimination diet. Green peas, no worries, there are other veggies I like more. Peanuts- well, I knew that already, and I was already operating under the assumption that I had a full blown peanut allergy and can't eat peanuts without possibly dying, but now I know I can potentially eat peanut butter without wrecking myself in the future, that's cool. Doesn't feel very helpful right now.   
This is so isolating. I can't eat meals with my family. I've doubled my pill intake. I really hope this helps me feel better, because honestly if I have to go through 2-4 weeks of eating nothing good (I can't even have an ensure!) and I still feel like crap, it's going to feel totally worthless.

1mo98av,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mo98av/can_possiave_coffee_filter_improve_your_brew/,Can Possiave Coffee Filter Improve Your Brew Flavor? Detailed Review on Cuisinart Compatible Filters,"I was really curious to try out the Possiave CECOMINOD023231 and see if the 12 Pack Cuisinart Compatible Coffee Filter Replacement could live up to its promises. Coffee is a daily ritual for me, so having a reliable and effective water filter for my machine is a non-negotiable. Over the past few weeks, I tested out these replacement charcoal water filters, and while I found plenty to love, there were some things you may want to keep in mind before making a purchase.

**Compatibility and Fit**

Compatibility was the first major factor I examined, and I’ll say, these filters did not disappoint. They’re designed to fit most Cuisinart coffee maker models, which was great news for me because I’ve had issues in the past with filters not fitting snugly. Installing these was a breeze—no awkward adjustments or forcing parts into place, which I deeply appreciate before my morning caffeine. Whether it’s models like the DCC-1200, DGB-500, or even the DCC-3200, these filters are built for a solid fit. 

**Positives**

- **Wide Compatibility:** Fits most Cuisinart coffee makers effortlessly.  
- **Micromesh Material:** Prevents clogging and ensures smooth water flow.  
- **Activated Carbon Excellence:** Made with natural coconut shell carbon for pure taste.  
- **Simple Installation:** Hassle-free placement in the machine.  

**Impurities and Flavor Enhancement**

One perk stood out right after trying these filters—the difference in coffee flavor. These things genuinely improve the taste by reducing chlorine, limescale, and other impurities. I ran a blind test with friends one afternoon, brewing a batch with and without these replacement filters. Everyone agreed the coffee brewed with this filter tasted noticeably smoother and lacked any faint chemical tang. It felt like I was sipping a fresh barista-quality espresso right at home.

[Check Possiave CECOMINOD023231 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00t5mw2q4/)

**Durability and Quality**

Quality impressed me the most. Possiave uses micromesh material to hold the charcoal in place, which prevents any residue from leaking into your machine—something cheaper filters fail at quite often. Believe me, I’ve had to deal with that mess more than once. Additionally, each filter is packed with activated coconut shell carbon, which has excellent adsorption capacity. I could tell they were built to last. For someone who drinks coffee almost every day, durability is a lifesaver.

**Drawbacks**

- **Static Pack Size:** Only available in a pack of 12, which might be excessive for light coffee drinkers.  
- **Bulk Purchases Only:** Not ideal if you're not committed long-term to this specific brand.  

**Eco-Friendliness**

Knowing these filters use natural coconut shell activated carbon makes me feel slightly better about my environmental footprint. It’s not a life-changing eco-solution, but every step toward sustainability counts. Compared to some other filters I’ve used that didn’t mention their material sourcing, this stood out as a more responsible option.

**Downsides**

- **Limited Use Material:** Despite its quality, the material isn’t biodegradable, which may concern eco-conscious buyers.  
- **Machine Specificity:** Compatibility with other branded machines outside Cuisinart is hit or miss.  

**Market Rivals**

If you’re wondering how these filters compare to other options out there, there are a few noteworthy contenders. The Keurig charcoal water filters are another reliable choice for specific users. However, I noticed they don’t fit Cuisinart models, making them less versatile than Possiave’s product. If versatility matters to you (as it does to me), this Cuisinart-compatible filter edges out the competition. Another rival would be the GOLDTONE water filters, which do have strong impurity removal but lack the micromesh structure. This often leads to clogging issues, which could shorten the life of your coffee machine.

**Price Performance**

Ultimately, the balance between quality and cost feels pretty fair with this product. It’s true that you can find cheaper filters, but with cheaper options, I usually feel like I’m compromising on taste or longevity. On the other hand, luxury brands claim better precision but often charge double the price, which I have a hard time justifying for a simple coffee filter. If I include the long-term benefits of protecting my coffee maker and achieving consistently pure-tasting brews, the price point feels like smart spending to me.

My kids (3 & 1) love dancing. They especially love dancing to “Dad music” - artists like Talking Heads, Price, etc. I also enjoy it because it’s a break from kids shows, and a chance to enjoy classic albums through a new lens.

Which leads to the idea: Saturday morning meetup where we put on a famous album we love and let our kids dance for an hour. I can rent a community room, bring coffee and donuts, and make it mutually enjoyable for everyone.

About a year ago my long term girlfriend/ Fiance and I broke up, I'm 33 and Haven't really dated since I was twenty four so I feel like I'm Is probably bringing twenty year old dating strategy to a middle age world, but I can't really figure out where I'm going wrong.

On dating apps my issue is that if I don't basically ask them back to my house for sex within the first few message women lose interest and stop replying. I thought I even had a date lined up for last Saturday, But as we started talking about what time we were going to meet she stopped replying and ghosted me. At the same time I sent a girl a message ""Damn you're hot, I wish you weren't so far away"" and she drove 40 mins to come hook up, and then also ghosted me.

Really the only ""date"" I have been able to get out of the apps was the girl that has become my on again off again fuck buddy. And honestly she begrudgingly went on a coffee date with me when I think she would have just been happy coming back to the house to fuck. She has made it very clear a few times that she is happy with our arrangement and doesn't want to change anything.

In person dates seem to go about the same way. I broke my shoulder during sparring and had to go to rehab. While there I really hit it off with the floor lead and he gave me his daughter number and told me she was single and looking to date.

We have a coffee date and about forty minutes in she basically says that she has to go back home to take care of her cats. I took that as a pretty hard no and just didn't message her again.

As I got better in Rehab I ended up working with a woman around my age and we also really hit it off. We talked a lot, there is a bit of flirting, she always made sure that she was my, and she always seems so excited and bubbly when she came into the waiting room to get me. On my last visit we exchanged numbers arranged a date and made sure that she knew it was a date. She seemed pretty traditional so I ended the night with a hug. We both talked about how our friends were coming into town. So we probably wouldn't be able to see each other for a week. I text her a week later and she never responds to me, so I also took that as a No and moved on.

Finally I have been kind of seeing an old highschool crush when we found out we both live in the same town now. She invites me to house parties and I bring her along When I have spare tickets to hockey games. We hook up sometimes, but she really goes back and forth with how interested she seems. Sometimes she comes in hot and heavy and seems really interested, but then just as quickly can become really distant and doesn't want to do anything physical for awhile And seems almost offended if I bring it up.

The TL;DR I guess is that Women seem to be interested in me physically and platonicly, Is but the moment the chance for romance comes up they seem to completely shut down.

I know the normal answer to this is, ""you smell shit everywhere you go check your own shoes"", but I don't feel like i'm a walking red flag or anything. I have a little house in the middle of town. I have a steady job that I like and make pretty good money. I have friends who seem to tolerate me and hobbies that I enjoy doing with them. I'm just not sure what I'm doing that seems to shut down any long term feelings from women.

Tea here, is made at most tea stalls in the purest form, we call it colloquially 'Darjeeling Liquor Tea', I was content with that taste for years, until I moved to Kolkata and realised doodh cha isn't bad afterall, and all these years of my mum brainwashing, 'khash na, acidity hobe!' suddenly went into vain. 

During my graduation days, I eventually saw myself inclining towards doodh cha more and more. (Special mention to Goabagan er chaa er dokan!) 

The thing about Kolkata is, you find tea stalls literally everywhere, and each one serves up tea that's unique. Some teas come with a hint of ginger, some with a touch of elaichi, some blend both, while some are plain and straightforward. And, of course not to mention the significant contribution of 'bhar (clay pot)' in elevation of taste. 

Then, I had to go to other states to pursue higher studies and jobs, but doodh cha didn't hit the way it hit before. In Orissa, tea felt a bit too bland, in Hyderabad a little too sweet and in Bangalore; milk and water ratio felt all messed up. And, eventually with time, I drifted to having coffee.

Maybe I had set high standards, or maybe my definition of a good tea is different, whatever it is, it is my own experience. But I'm yet to try chai from Northern part of India, so let's see, if it disappoints or astonishes me!

1mo903h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mo903h/should_you_choose_the_oxo_brew_8_cup_coffee_maker/,Should You Choose the OXO Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker Review for Perfect Coffee?,"The OXO 8718800 Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker in stainless steel and black has been a part of my daily coffee routine for the past month. The sleek and compact design immediately caught my eye when unboxing it. With limited counter space, the size was a welcome surprise. Measuring just 10.5""D x 7""W x 13.5""H, it fits snugly under my cabinets, a feature I didn’t realize I needed until I used it. This coffee maker promises Specialty Coffee Association-certified brewing, and after testing it extensively, I have plenty to say about its strengths and potential downsides.

**Design That Balances Form and Function**  
Right out of the box, the stainless steel finish of the coffee maker feels premium. It doesn’t just look the part; it’s well-built, with a sturdy and compact design that doesn't demand too much space. The first thing my partner commented on was the thermal carafe—it felt solid yet manageable, and its rounded shape combined functionality with aesthetics. Whether it’s single-serve brewing or a full carafe, the design works seamlessly. I found the removable well cover incredibly practical, accommodating mugs of different sizes, including my favorite oversized travel cup. Plus, the Rainmaker showerhead adds a touch of innovation for even water distribution, something I noticed made a difference in the coffee’s flavor right from the first brew.  

**Positives**  
- Specialty Coffee Association-certified for expert-level brewing.  
- Compact size that slides comfortably under cabinets.  
- Double-wall thermal carafe keeps coffee tasting fresh and hot.  

[Check OXO 8718800 Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07h9g93wk/)

**Performance That Delivers Satisfying Cups**  
One of the first mornings using this coffee maker left an impression. The coffee tasted distinctively fresh, thanks to the BetterBrew precision control—a feature designed to regulate temperature and brewing cycles. It really delivers on its promise of consistent extraction, with even the smallest details like the integrated bloom cycle enhancing the coffee’s body and flavor. Brewing for a larger group delivered equally impressive results. The well-insulated carafe kept our coffee piping hot for hours during a weekend brunch, saving me multiple trips to reheat.  

**Benefits**  
- The brew-through, pour-through lid eliminates unnecessary fussing.  
- It brews equally well for individuals or groups, with a simple transition between single-serve and carafe brewing.  
- Water temperature is expertly maintained throughout brewing.  

**Room for Improvement**  
While I enjoy this coffee maker overall, there are areas that could use tweaking. Setting up the brew for a single cup isn’t as straightforward as brewing a full carafe. The additional single-serve accessory, while clever, feels like an unnecessary extra step compared to other machines that simplify one-mug brewing. There’s also a learning curve with the controls—easy for coffee aficionados but possibly challenging for more casual users.  

**Critiques**  
- Single-cup brewing requires additional setup with the accessory.  
- Controls could be more intuitive, especially for beginners.  

**Competing Brands**  
When considering other contenders, I briefly tested a Keurig machine alongside the OXO brewer. While the Keurig is faster and more user-friendly for single-cup brewing, it fell short on coffee flavor and temperature consistency. I also compared it to a Technivorm Moccamaster, known for its top-notch brewing. The Moccamaster edges out this coffee maker in durability and quick brewing times, but the OXO holds the advantage in design and space efficiency. Between these competitors, the OXO achieves the best balance of style, functionality, and performance.

**Affordable Quality**  
Evaluating its price point relative to its competitors, the OXO coffee maker justifies the investment with its noteworthy features. While not the cheapest option, its innovative brewing technology, premium thermal carafe, and SCA certification mean you’re paying for quality and precision. If you’re someone who values gourmet coffee at home but doesn’t want to venture into overly complex machines, this one hits the sweet spot.

As someone who relies on their morning cup (or cups) to kickstart the day, ensuring the quality of the water in my coffee maker is crucial. This product is specifically designed for Cuisinart machines, and as a long-time Cuisinart user, I knew I had to give it a go. After a solid few weeks of use, I have some thoughts—both great and a few not-so-great—but overall, it’s been a worthwhile addition to my kitchen routine. 

**Material and Build Quality**  
One thing that immediately caught my attention was the charcoal material used in these filters. Known for its ability to absorb impurities, the charcoal in these filters works to eliminate unpleasant tastes, chlorine, and other water contaminants. I use tap water, so having these filters is not just a bonus—it’s almost mandatory for improving the flavor and ensuring a smooth coffee experience. The filters themselves feel sturdy despite being lightweight, which is reassuring. Each one measures approximately 1-7/8"" x 3/4"" x 1"", so they fit perfectly into my Cuisinart coffee maker without any hassle.

**Ease of Installation**  
These filters score top marks for ease of use. Installing them is as straightforward as it gets. There’s no fumbling or confusion; they slide right into place like they were made for the job—which they essentially are! Even if you’re not the most tech-savvy person (I’ll admit I’m not always the best with instructions), you’ll find this task exceptionally simple. A minute or two, and you’re all set to brew.

[Check BRENSTEN CECOMINOD031297 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01ka5xe7u/)

**Performance and Effect on Coffee Quality**  
These filters genuinely shine in this category. Since switching to these replacements, the difference in my coffee’s flavor has been glaringly positive. The usual impurities that I would sometimes taste with unfiltered water seem to vanish completely. The coffee tastes fuller, with a noticeably enhanced aroma and smoothness. I can’t claim these filters singlehandedly turned my mornings around, but they sure made my coffee worth savoring more than ever.

**Compatibility with Various Machines**  
As someone with multiple coffee machine setups (don’t judge; I’m just indecisive in the mornings), I loved seeing that these filters are compatible with a wide range of models. Whether it’s my older Cuisinart or the newer one I purchased last year, these fit seamlessly. They work with models like DCC-1100, DCC-1200, DCC-2600—just to name a few. There’s something reassuring about not having to worry about whether I’ve bought the right thing or not. 

**Benefits**  
- Charcoal material effectively removes impurities, chlorine, and odors.  
- Easy to install; no complicated setup required.  
- Fits a variety of Cuisinart coffee maker models, both old and new.   
- Noticeable improvement in coffee taste and aroma.

**Limitations**  
- These need to be replaced monthly to maintain effectiveness, which can feel frequent for some.  
- Not compatible with non-Cuisinart models. If you own a Keurig or another brand, you’re out of luck.  
- The filter size, while perfect for its intended machines, doesn’t leave room for versatility with more unconventional or off-brand setups.  

**Competing Products**  
In the sea of charcoal filters available online, it’s hard not to compare this product to alternatives like the Housewares Solutions Replacement Filters or the Geesta Premium Filters. Both are excellent options for Cuisinart machines, but where the BRENSTEN filters tend to excel is their fit and ease of installation. Some competitors have issues with occasional leaks or not fitting quite right, which can really ruin the user experience. On the flip side, the Geesta filters, for example, come in slightly more eco-friendly packaging—a small detail, but one worth mentioning for the environmentally conscious.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of overall value, these filters strike a great balance between cost and quality. The pack of 12 ensures you’re covered for an entire year if you replace them monthly, which the manufacturer recommends. While there might be some less expensive knock-offs out there, you don’t want to skimp on something so crucial to the taste of your coffee. It’s worth the investment to have good-tasting coffee every single day—and to prolong the life of your coffee machine.

1mo8w67,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mo8w67/four_men_and_a_dollar_store_part_1/,Four Men and a Dollar Store (part 1),"It was a normal day, as all days are before something noteworthy occurs, when Nicholas first saw the fog bank. It wasn't at all unusual for him to see a bit of mist on the road to work. He thought nothing of it. Quite to the contrary, he enjoyed seeing fog in some vague, unstated way. It was a cool morning, especially for July, and he didn't have the windows down or the air conditioning on, but rather Nicholas simply bobbed his head to the familiar playlist while absentmindedly cruising down the road as he did on a thousand other days. The sight of the fog was the first moment of actual emotive consciousness he had felt since getting into the car forty minutes ago. The trip was etched into his muscles, the car seemed to know on its own how to get to the destination.

And what a destination it was, a Dollar General, randomly set on a foundation in the middle of nowhere. The mixed woods crowded up close to the back of the squat, square building while across from its front doors there was an open field leading to some scrubs and a marsh. Just up the road next to the dollar store was a laundromat attached to a long-desolate pizza parlor. Nicholas couldn't see either at the moment.

The car in front of him slowed, visible only by the glowing brake lights through the sheet of white. In the middle of the road, splayed in a pile of distorted limbs, was a deer. A bit pink intestinal tract was pushed just barely out of its snout, and the legs were broken in several places, white bone jutting free of the patchy, tawny hide. It looked a bit like a dead spider, but that wasn't what caught Nicholas's attention. It was the eyes, they were blue and small, rimmed in white like a person's. In that brief moment, Nicholas thought he saw one of the eyes flick to meet his gaze. Then he blinked and the deer was out of sight, swallowed by the fog as his car idled onward. 

Sunlight assaulted his eyes unexpectedly, and then he was out of the fog bank. Looking in the rearview, the cloud seemed to stand just behind his car, slowly shrinking into a distant thing. He waited for the big yellow ""Dollar General"" sign to appear and turned just before it, the car hiking up the oddly mounded curb into the oversized parking lot. 

The man sighed with the tedium of daily life, neither cursing nor relishing the plain work ahead of him. It paid, and work was easy enough most days. The lot was almost empty, but he always preferred to park under the great oak which stood near the street. He exited the car, quickly flipping the limp seatbelt from the doorway back into the seat where it lay, it never once having properly retracted in all the years of Nicholas's ownership. As always, he mentally recoiled at the sight of the innumerable cigarette butts and pieces of other refuse which lined the curb of the lot, bits of old gum here and wasted and soaked napkins there. Near the silver and glass doors to the store, Nicholas caught sight of Ben, the store manager. 

He stood finishing the last of a cigarette and flicked it to the ground before crushing it quickly and mechanically underfoot. Their eyes met and both men raised their hands quickly and without any real motion that could be described as a wave. Ben was a big man, a bit fat but mostly made of muscle, barrel chested and broad armed, mostly bald and given to wear a constant smile no matter the circumstances.

""Having fun yet?"" Ben said, repeating the same greeting he always gave Nicholas, his face spreading into a jovial grin behind the thin and well kempt beard, ""I'm stocking milk for the next hour probably.""

Nicholas laughed a bit and grunted a meaningless sound as a reply, following Ben inside. There, immediately to the right of the pair and behind the counter, stood Cooper, the perpetual assistant manager. He was thin, a bit tall, very pale to the point of sickliness, and had bags under his eyes. Anyone with eyes could tell he was mostly Irish. Despite what some might conclude from his appearances, he was a hard worker and a respite for everyone who met him. Cooper was the type to complain while he worked, the words would flow out of him and justify his further effort in whatever he toiled at. 

""Another day in paradise."" Cooper said with irony dripping in his voice, ""Do anything good over the weekend?""

Nicholas feigned a smile, ""Yup, me, myself, and I all had a great time staring at a screen the past two days. Riceroni was good, too.""

""Checkout reset today."" Cooper said with distain, ""They want us to switch the jerky meat and the front candies, on top of the normal updates. It's gonna be two days at least unless we get no customers.""

Nicholas sighed in sympathy and walked to the office room, just past the water fountains and bathroom. For near two years he had worked here, week after week in limbo. A tall middle aged black man sat in the torn office chair, his clothing a bit dusty and his face shone of a timid sort of resignation. 

""Nick.""

""Luke.""

Thus was the extent of their communication on most days, with an occasional comment about the weather. Luke was a solid worker, though often called out sick to get some time with his family. He was the most recent addition to the store staff and while Nicholas liked Luke, he barely knew him. Right now, Luke was having a breakfast of canned sardines in hot sauce and a pint of off-brand ice coffee - both undoubtedly bought from the store itself just after he came in for the day. Nicholas retrieved the checkout planograms, the plastic wrapped documents containing the instructions, labels, price strips, and anything else the company decided they would need for the job at hand. 

As he left the office and returned to the checkout a few customers milled into the store, a group of Hispanics he recognized as regular customers. They spoke plainly in Spanish, loud and unbothered with bothering others. A bullet speaker clung to one of their hips, playing music. Nicholas sniffed with subtle distain, but kept working. The music was a bit distasteful, but the group were all decent enough, polite when asking for help in his experience. He set to work pulling the old price strips from their channels by the Slim Jims and 5 Hour Energy drinks and the door was pushed open again. This time it was an older woman, pulling a cart behind her. She struggled a bit as the door swung shut on the cart, and Cooper stepped from behind the counter to hold the door open for her.

""Someday Mrs. Evans, someday we'll get the automatics doors."" Cooper cooed, as though for a thousand years they had waited for this thing to happen.

""Oh dear, that'll be the day."" The old woman said with a smile, ""I'll miss you holding the door when that day comes, dear.""

As the door swung shut the fog rolled up the road and filled the parking lot. It pressed right up against the glass of the storefront. Cooper turned and looked into a it for a moment, then turned back to his phone. A few minutes passed in silence, the somewhat distant sound of Spanish dissolving into the background noise of mundanity inside Nicholas's mind. 

DONK

Nicholas looked up to see someone had pressed themselves into the wrong door at the front, and quickly adjusted to come in though the correct one. The man was short, his hair greasy and slick, his hoodie stained in places and his shoes made wet noises as he walked rapidly to the counter.

""Give me a pack of smokes."" The man gurgled through a wheezing throat, ""Right now.""

""What kind?"" Cooper asked, still looking at his phone.

The man cleared his throat wetly, ""Doesn't matter, gimme the fucking smokes."" 

Cooper looked up and Nicholas saw his face change from plain to stressed in an instant. The subtle muscles under his skin tensed as he looked down towards the strange man's chest.

""No need for that, just tell me what kind you want and I'll get it for you."" Cooper said, his voice shifting in some way Nicholas couldn't describe but understood at once.

""Anything."" The man repeated, coughing phlegm onto the tiled floor, ""Now.""

This last word he spoke weakly, as if the air was knocked from him by a blow on the back. Nicholas broke into a sweat. He slowly reached into his right-hand pocket, gripping something, then pulling a small pistol from his pants pocket. He checked the magazine, which had a tendency to unclick from its housing if pressed the wrong way in his pants, and looked back up to the thief. 

""Ok man, let me unlock it and I'll get you some Newport's."" Cooper said, his hands slightly raised as he spoke.

Nicholas swallowed and wiped his hands on his shirt, one after the other, and slowly began to stand up from his crouched position by the meat snacks. Just as he stood up, the strange man emitted an odor like the muck from the bottom of a lake and began to cough spasmodically. He bent over, almost falling down, and Nicholas watched nervously, confused about what action to take. A patch of the man's hair slid off his scalp and landed with a wet plop. The pistol wasn't raised, and the thief straightened himself back up, yelling through mucus.

""Everybody get out!"" Came the cry through thick curtains of stretchy saliva, ""Right fucking now!""

As Nicholas watched, the man turned, revealing a small pocket knife pointed outward in shaky motions. Within a moment the customers and Ben had approached the front of the store. The old woman's eyes brimmed with tears while the Hispanics muttered among themselves. Nicholas held the gun low, behind the display, unseen by anyone except Ben, who caught his eye and lowered his hand in a gesture to indicate patience.

""Go on,"" Ben said loudly, in a neutral but commanding tone, ""Everyone leave like he said.""

The customers filtered out of the store quickly, disappearing into the white cloud that still clung to the front doors. The strange man immediately stepped towards the doors and turned the deadbolt on them. He turned back to Cooper, who handed him a pack of cigarettes. The man took them in a jerky grasping motion almost like a jab, partially crushing the box in his slick fingers. He slashed quickly and imprecisely across the box, and tore it open, pulling out a rumpled cigarette and placing it in his lips.

""Light me."" He said, his speech a bubbling whisper only heard because of the dead silence between the three men. Nicholas made eye contact again with Ben, who again gestured calm and patience. Ben made a subtle motion of his eyes towards the office, and Nicholas realized Luke must still be inside that room, on the phone with police. The robber leaned a bit forward as Cooper pulled a lighter from the display by the register and lit the flame for the man.

Just then, the man coughed out a pocket of phlegm and fell over in a fit, sputtering and choking and rolling about. Ben quickly dashed in and put a knee down on the man's midsection, easily pulling the knife away and restraining the thrashing man. The coughing heightened, and the man tried to speak but could only wheeze and groan as he ran out of steam to resist his capture. Ben rolled the man onto his chest and pulled his wet arms together behind his back. Nicholas, feeling his call to action, stepped around the display and spoke. 

""Cooper, tape!"" He called, waking Cooper from his stunned state. The thin man tossed a roll of clear packing tape from behind the counter to Nicholas, who knelt down next to Ben and the thief.

The man was taped up in a few moments, still coughing and thrashing a bit. His hands were bound, his feet were bound, and Ben stepped up from the thief while breathing heavily.

""Thank you."" Ben said at last, catching his breath, looking at nobody in particular, and abstaining from explaining his appreciation further than that.

Luke appeared from around the corner, holding out his phone. He shook his head as he spoke.

""Landline isn't working and my cell service is down, someone else has to call."" He explained quickly, not wanting to approach closer to the bound man.

Immediately they all produced their devices and almost immediately they all expressed a similar finding. Luke shrugged and walked back into the office, not wanting to be near the scene before him. 

Ben stepped away from the bound man, ""Guy must have cut the phone lines. I'll go to the laundromat and call using theirs.""

He reached down and pulled a cigarette from the ruined Newport pack and stood just by the door, lighting it up and unlocking the deadbolt. Then he quickly stepped out into the fog and almost completely disappeared, his burning ember glowing through the white sheet as he turned to look at the store once before fading from view. Cooper and Nicholas turned to the man whose limbs were taped together on the floor. He was barely breathing now, grey lumps of mucus coming from his nose and mouth with each exhalation, punctuated by water inhalations that sounded similar to a tightly clogged sink.

""What do you think's wrong with him?"" Cooper asked suddenly, ""Meth?""

""Maybe drugs, yeah."" Nicholas responded, ""But he didn't want money, just cigarettes.""

""Yeah, weird."" Cooper agreed, ""Maybe he's sick with something. You know, delirious?""

""Could be both. Sick and in withdrawal from something."" Nicholas said noncommittally, ""Doesn't really matter, he's the cops' problem in a few minutes."" 

The man stopped breathing suddenly, the wheezing gasps terminated by an sound like a balloon slowly leaking from a tiny hole. The two men looked at each other silently. Cooper moved first, coming around the counter and putting a rolled up jacket under the man's head and turning him on his side. Cooper made a disgusted noise and wiped a slick wetness from touching the man's body on his shirt before stepping away.

""What do we do?"" Nicholas asked blankly, ""Heimlich?""

Cooper bent down and pressed himself hesitantly against the man's soaked chest. After a few seconds he pulled away.

""He's still alive, but I'm not giving him mouth to mouth."" Cooper said shakily, ""I'm just not doing it.""

""We're on camera."" 

Cooper looked up at the other man and sighed, bending over the unconscious man and tilting his chin in preparation. A yellow foam started to seep out from the corner's of the man's mouth, and Cooper jumped back, suddenly anxious and wringing his hands.

""No, nope, not happening,"" He kept repeating. 

Luke came over from the office, looking drained of blood, shaking just a little. 

""We can't just leave him, man."" Luke said quickly, making eye contact with Nicholas, ""That'd be killing him.""

""Guy's killed himself."" Nicholas responded before looking away, ""Jesus, what a morning. What the hell.""

""Hell do you mean, he 'killed himself',"" Luke said a bit angry, starting towards the checkout area, ""You can't just write people off like that man, who made you judge?""

""Jesus, Luke, he was a psycho."" Nicholas said with an unsure tone, ""You didn't have a knife pointed at you, don't pretend you were anywhere but that office room. Damn it, what the hell do you want me to do about it?""

""Don't you like, stab a hole into his throat and put a straw in?"" Luke suggested, ""I saw it in a show once.""

""Be my guest."" Cooper interjected, ""I'm not stabbing a guy because of a show you watched.""

The man convulsed once, twice, and then was still once more. The three men standing around him all exchanged glances and Cooper shook his head. Nicholas approached and knelt down to check the man's heartbeat. The door opened and Ben stepped inside, Luke quickly came over and told him what had happened while also closing the door. As he closed the door, a bit of the cloud slipped inside and Luke inhaled it, coughing suddenly and waving a hand.

""Phone's dead over there, too."" Ben explained, ""The fog is everywhere, feels like a sauna, I don't think we can drive anywhere. I got lost in the parking lot for a minute.""

Nicholas heard a soft clink while his head had not quite made it down to check the man's heartbeat. The thief's face was to the side, and something shiny and white had fallen to the floor beside it. A slick, bloody tooth. Nicholas felt a shudder in his body and opened the man's mouth. It was filled with loose teeth, rubbing against each other near the entrance to his throat in a wet mix of phlegm and blood. He let go of the man's face and got up, holding his own mouth in sympathetic surprise.

""His teeth have all fallen out."" Nicholas said through his hand.

""What?"" Cooper asked, ""Holy shit!""

Cooper knelt down next to the man and opened his mouth, repeating, ""I do not want to do this, I do NOT want to do this,"" over and over, wincing in disgust and scooping the bloody dental articles out into a pile while gagging. He gave the man a chest compression, and a few more teeth pumped out from the throat and into the mouth, molars and a wad of bloodied gumflesh.

""Jesus Christ."" Cooper muttered, continuing the compressions, but no more teeth appeared, only small geysers of mucus and blood, ""Fuck man he's really dead. I mean he's really dead.""

Nicholas knelt back down next to the man, and noticed something pooling by his hands. Blood, thin and watery, was coming in a slow leak from under the thief's fingernails. Nicholas lifted the man's hands and examined them for a moment. The fingernails were soft and plump, and were seemingly fusing with the skin underneath, the leaking blood looked like the melted remnants of the flesh that hides under every man's nails. He dropped the hands to the floor and grabbed Cooper, pulling him up and away.

""Screw that."" Nicholas said with fear in his voice, ""Guy's sick, fucking hell, we better not have it too.""

Luke coughed and they all looked at him. He was standing with his back to the doorway, his fist balled up by his mouth. Ben was staring at the pile of teeth, his ever present smile faded into a neutral line. Luke coughed again, muttering that he had swallowed the wrong way, and quickly excused himself to leave the scene and head down to another part of the store. After a few moments of silence, Luke arrived back, holding a large bath towel from the store's stock. He draped it over the man's body, covering his head. He stopped as he was just about to cover the man's face.

""His eyes..."" Luke said softly, ""I thought they were shut.""

The man's eyes were open slightly, the whites of them had turned a deep brown. In sudden fear, Luke dropped the towel the rest of the way, and did not adjust it when the head wasn't completely covered. One eye peaked out still from a fold the towel had taken while falling, unblinking and glassy. Abruptly, the towel moved and the man let out a choking scream. All the others jumped back, Nicholas pulled the pistol out again and grit his teeth, not knowing what to expect. There was an odd sound, like Velcro being separated, and then a plopping noise quickly followed by another plop. The man rolled over on all fours, his arms free and his legs stanced like a deep crouch on either side of his body. Two lumps under the blanket remained as he crawled out from it, shoes left behind. No longer did the man seem just sweaty, but sheerly slick with a layer of oil. A gurgle came from his throat constantly, like the wail of a drowning animal. He turned his head suddenly and looked straight up at Nicholas, his eyes completely brown with a tinge a yellow in the middle where his iris should have been. Hair sloughed from his scalp, left in chunks on the floor and on the candy display as he rubbed himself along the black wire shelves. The men backed away at various distances, Nicholas pointed the gun with a shaking hand, unsure of what to do, everyone uttering various curses and exclamations. With an unexpected swiftness the man leapt over the display case and repeatedly jumped with his bent legs and naked, oversized feet down the hallway and pushed through the double doors into the back room. Luke sprinted after him, quickly grabbing a nearby broom from a display and pushing it through the metal door handles before backing away just as quickly and returning to the others. 

""What do we do now?"" Luke asked upon his return, his eyes frantic and his face sweating, ""Phones are still down.""

He coughed suddenly, and bent over with his hands on his knees. The other men stepped back from him. He looked up at them, ""C'mon guys, I'm just winded from running a bit. Jesus, don't do that to me.""

The men looked guiltily at their feet or the floor, but none came closer to Luke again. Ben stepped behind the counter and scanned a pack of Marlboro reds, opening the register and shoving some cash in before quickly tearing at the pack and lighting up. 

""Can't smoke in the store."" Cooper said absentminded, clearly lost in anxious thoughts.

Ben inhaled deeply and exhaled smoke as he responded calmly, ""Fuck the store.""

Cooper reach out an imploring hand and Ben obliged to spot him a cigarette, quickly helping him with the lighter. They both stood, inhaling and shaking, Cooper more than Ben. Nicholas walked away from the others, towards the back room, pistol at the ready. He checked the chamber quickly, made sure the magazine was seated, repeating this several times over as he slowly made his way towards the double doors. The sound of wet flesh against tile was in the room, and Nicholas shifted the pistol into one hand as he grabbed a wrapped bundle of bungie cords from a shelf nearby. The broom was hastily placed and it showed, the wide head was the only thing holding it from sliding out of the handles. Quickly Nicholas placed one hook of a bungie on a handle and wove the length of it around and through several times, placing the other hook where it wouldn't be easily removed. The door was relatively shut tight and he tried it several times to be sure. The wet movements inside were accompanied suddenly by a shocking loud noise, like a fleshy barrel squeezing air through a valve. Nicholas slapped his hands to his ears and ran away, seeing the other men also covering their ears. So sudden was the shock of the sound that his pistol was pressed flatly against one of his ears. The noise came and went like a blaring alarm, rising then shrinking quickly to a consistent beat. Then, it ceased.

""What the hell was that?"" Ben spoke from behind his cigarette, still holding his hands to his ears.

""It was like a giant frog."" Luke said suddenly, looking terribly ill from the noise, ""It sounded just like a giant bullfrog.""

After that, Luke slid to the ground, gasping a bit. He clutched at his neck for a moment, as if trying to manually clear a clog from the outside, and then resumed breathing raggedly. 

""I don't feel good."" He said after a few seconds had passed in group silence.

The wail from the backroom started again, deafening and consistent. Nicholas watched as the smaller items on the shelves of the back room's wall jittered and danced in place with the sound. It did not last as long this time, and quiet resumed to the relief of everyone there. 

""Let's get you in the office."" Ben said as he flick the cigarette outside, the fog seeming to part as it flew by. He helped Luke to his feet and led him away while Cooper and Nicholas looked at each other.

""Probably just his breakfast."" Nicholas sputtered quickly, ""He was eating sardines and coffee for breakfast.""

""Probably."" Cooper agreed, though he sounded completely unconvinced. 

Nicholas looked outside, a bit of space cleared from the front doors in the fog, and silently hoped it was clearing out so he could get in his car and leave this place. He could take the day off, easily, and felt he needed it. Still, the fog wasn't clearing, it simply hung back a few feet from the door for several minutes while Nicholas listened to Ben fussing over Luke in the office, the sounds of deep coughs filling the distance between the four men. Then the fog pressed back up against the glass, and suddenly there was darkness.

The power had shut off. The fog filtered the light so that only the very front of the store had any visibility. Ben came out to them from the office, shaking his head.

""One thing after another."" He said with a thin smile, ""If that guy in the back room is like that from some disease, we've all probably got it, but-"" 

Another series of painful croaks bristled through the air, silencing any speech the men were trying to have. Finally, it stopped, and Nicholas gestured for Ben to continue.

""But I think it might be the fog."" He finished.

There was a moment of silence.

""No, if it was the fog you'd be sick too."" Cooper said over his cigarette as he finished it. Still, when he moved to open the door and throw the butt outside, he stopped himself and put it out on the counter, leaving it there like a tent stake.

""The guy wanted to smoke."" Nicholas said, remembering, ""All he wanted was to smoke. Maybe he knew something we didn't.""

""I smoked right before the fog rolled in."" Ben recalled, ""You think that's why I'm not sick but Luke is?""

""Better give him one, too."" Cooper gestured to Ben on Nicholas's behalf, ""Even if we're wrong, just one won't hurt you.""

""Let me try something."" Nicholas said idly while taking the cigarette and letting Ben light it for him. He went down the bathroom aisle and grabbed up a hand towel, then went to the first aid section and opened a bottle of rubbing alcohol and soaked half the towel. He returned with it and gestured for Ben to light it. It only took a moment for the flame to spread and Nicholas quickly pulled open the door and tossed the towel out, black smoke snaking from the little tongues of fire. The fog pulled away from the door by a few feet, and kept away even after the fire had gone out. For several minutes they watched as the fog slowly drew back in and pressed against the door.

A loud crash rang out from the back room, and they all looked in that direction. Cooper cursed and jogged down an aisle, grabbing some headless wooden broom handles and then turning down the kitchen aisle. He came back to the front of the store carrying a bundle of broomsticks, a few large kitchen knives, and two rolls of duct tape. They didn't speak about it, but all started working quickly to open the knives from their plastic clamshells and attach them to the end of the broomsticks, though Ben opted to whittle down one end of his broomstick to a point and keep the knife separate, tucked carefully into his belt. This small comfort of mechanical work completed, the men listened as another wailing of the man in the back room began, only to quickly end with a new and odd crashing noise.

""There's something else."" Nicholas said quietly. All three men kept their eyes fixed on the door to the back room, even as Luke broke into a retching fit, none of them could look away. They were all stock still, waiting and tense. Something about the spears in their hands had changed the fabric of them to a more ancient design. Nicholas coughed, not used to the smoke in his lungs and mouth, and spat onto the floor.

Then all hell broke loose. The backroom became a fury of noise and action, crashing and breaking, animal screaming and a short barking type of the same wailing it had made earlier. A slam and a cry, the sounds of something like tearing paper and a yowling cat. 

Behind the men, something bumped into the front doors. None of them saw what it was by the time they turned to look. The back room doors were struck suddenly and with a massive force. The broom handle cracked and slipped out as the bungie cords were pulled taunt and stretched to their limit in a singular instant of pressure. A protruding grey-green limb, fat and rubbery, bent at an odd angle that must have been the joint, had been thrust through the gap in the door and was now trapped there by the closing of the door. The cries from the back room became feverishly excited, as something again and again tried to pull itself free from the door, and something else clearly harrassed it bodily at the same time. The wailing pitched and there was a tearing noise and a pop like removing the drumstick from a baked chicken, and then the cries morphed down to a slow, nearly human weeping that got quieter and quieter, accompanied by the sounds of something being dragged away, into the distance. The wretched limb remained, jammed into the crack of the door, bleeding just a little, and silence resumed. None of the men moved. They still stood tense, listening. The sound of Luke falling from the office chair finally pricked Ben into moving to check on him, while the other two continued their watch. 

Nicholas finally nodded to Cooper and quietly motioned that he was going to the back room door. He walked as silently as he could manage, stepping lightly and cringing at every little sound he made in movement. It seemed to him that his whole body was now suddenly made of sounds, the creaking of his joints, the rattle of the zipper on one of his pants pockets, his breath drawing and leaving slow enough to hurt him for want of oxygen. He saw the limb clearly now, a patchwork of ragged flesh sheered off by the door near the gap in the struggle. With his broomstick, he pressed the thing down and back into the room it came from, the doors pulling quickly shut under the pressure of the bungies. He let out a sigh of relief, but at the same time he saw through the gap of the door a glimpse of the back room. Boxes were trampled and overturned everywhere, carts and boxes knocked around and spattered with bits of blood. Most ominously, the doubles doors to outside, where shipment came in from the semitrucks, had only one door still hanging in place by one bent hinge. The fog was leaking inside slowly, seeming to pause sometimes like a nervous insect exploring a new place.

Nicholas let out a small involuntary gasp and ran to the hardware section, grabbing a roll of duct tape and returning. He began quickly to tape shut the relatively large gaps in the doors to the backroom, though by the small pool of blackening blood at the bottom he could get no purchase in making it stick. Instead he emptied a nearby cardboard display full of old DVDs and pressed it against the bottom crack, taping above and below it where the cardboard met unsullied surfaces. Behind him, Cooper approached, carrying the makeshift spear at his waist in a loose arm.

""What was it?"" Cooper asked quietly.

Nicholas did not stop his work, ""An arm or a leg, I'm not quite sure.""

""Yeah, sure, but what was it?"" Cooper repeated.

Now he stopped his taping, finished off with a second set of bungie cords around the handles and slid a few brooms between the tense cords for good measure, ""I don't know. Get me the hell outta here, that's all I'm thinkin' right now.""

Cooper stared at Nicholas, seeming to chew on the words spoken to him for a moment, and then tried the door himself and walked away, apparently feeling good about the jerry-rigged lock.

Nicholas then pulled over a large cart from the end of an aisle, still mostly filled with condensation coated milk jugs stacked in boxes and pushed it in front of the doors. Then he walked to the office, where Luke sat with his head limp in the chair, Ben sitting on the desk in front of him, wiping sweat from Luke's pallid forehead. The sick man's lips mumbled, occasionally his eyes fluttered open a moment, only to close again. 

""He tried to lock himself in here a few minutes ago, I had to unlock it to come inside."" Ben said without looking away, ""He thinks he's going to die.""

Nicholas said nothing, but handed a water bottle he had taken from the shelves to Ben. Ben opened it and gratefully drank about half of it, and poured the rest onto the towel he had been drying Luke with, washing it out and cooling it off before pressing it against the sick man's head.

""It's a fever, or something like it."" Ben explained, ""And his hands, I'm not sure what to make of them.""

Nicholas stepped in from the doorway and saw thanks to the propped up flashlight that Luke's hands were bandaged with gauze and medical tape. The man's arms were always thin, but now they were nearly skeletal, and Nicholas had trouble looking at his face. He hadn't known Luke well, but he was sure his face had changed. Something was wrong with it, his jaws were pushed outward more than usual, narrowing and maybe two or three inches jutting out from where they should have been. His nose had become flatter, and darker in color, like a bruise, and looked like it would fall off it someone touched it the wrong way. Luke's eyes flitted open, and he cleared his throat before speaking in a rasp.



""I'm not gonna make it, Nick."" The man hoarsed out, ""Ben's been here helping me and he isn't sick yet, neither are you. You guys gotta get my note to my family for me. My little boy, he won't understand unless he reads it when he grows up.""

Luke reached out his hands and noticed they were heavily bandaged, almost like bloodless amputations. Tears came down his face then, and he could not stop them from flowing, nor his throat from making piteous whimpers. After a few seconds, he composed himself somewhat and spoke again.

""It's in my shirt pocket. Ben, please take it, and then leave me alone."" He said, his throat working in sobs that he silenced through wavering will, ""I don't know if you'll get sick, and I don't want that to have a chance of happening. Leave me here, close the door, please.""

""Do you want anything?"" Ben asked calmly, the shadow of a smile still on his face, and Luke looked at him with as much warmth as a sick man can muster.

""No Ben, thank you for the kindness you have given me."" He swallowed hard, and with apparent pain, ""Get them the note, that's all I want now.""

With that he closed his eyes again, and breathed deeply. Nicholas frowned at Ben, grief plain on both men's faces. Ben took the folded printer paper note and tucked it into his front pocket, patting it twice before he walk out and knocked the doorstop away. The door swung shut and Nicholas stopped, considering barring the door somehow, but moved on without acting on the thought. 

""How is it?"" Cooper asked as the two men walked back to the counter, the only place in the store still granted some natural light. He was eating from a pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream with a flimsy plastic spoon, a pile of broken ones sitting on the counter next to the growing pool of condensation, ""He gonna be ok?""

Ben shook his head and lit another cigarette, walking over to the drink coolers across the store, muttering something about an energy drink. Nicholas looked down at the ice cream and back up to Cooper, saying nothing, his face blank. Cooper put down the spoon and threw out the pint in the garbage behind him with a mournful exhalation.

Some time passed quietly, Cooper smoking and Ben taking sips from an off brand energy drink with an eagle on it. Nicholas unfolded a beach chair and sat in thought, sharing nothing but deeply considering something. Finally he spoke, after several minutes of group silence.

""The fog doesn't like smoke."" He said slowly, staring at the old water stains on the ceiling panels, ""I drove through the fog to get here, so either it can't get into cars or the exhaust kept it out.""

""I drove through the fog too."" Cooper agreed, ""But only for a minute.""

""Yeah, but we can't get anywhere in the fog."" Ben interjected, ""It's too thick, we'd run off the road, and I wouldn't want to be trapped in a ditch with the fog all around. Plus there could be other cars on the road stuck and in the way. We wouldn't be able to move them without getting out into the fog.""

""But you ran right through it to get to the laundromat."" Nicholas commented, ""You think the cigarette was enough to protect you then?""

""Must have been."" Ben pondered, ""Well, I still wouldn't bet on it. Not now that we've seen what it does.""

They were all silent and Nicholas looked towards the office door, still closed. No more rasping cough came from within. Finally he spoke again.

""Should we lock the office door?"" Nicholas asked calmly and slowly, expecting some reprisal.

Other two were quiet for a few seconds, then without words Cooper started towards the door with keys in hand. Ben shook his head and smoked between sips of his drink, ""Terrible mouthfeel, to be honest. God awful."" was his only comment. 

Cooper's sudden cry of surprise and fear broke the silence followed by a repeated crashing and a sound like the scraping of a metal tool against the tile flooring. The two men by the counter were at once on their feet and bracing for whatever was to come. Cooper ran to them, panting and panicked, his spear dropped. Behind him, from the darkened store, a quiet moan could be heard. A clacking and clicking across the floor, and for a brief but terrible moment the men saw what had become of Luke. On all fours he stumbled, his limbs thin and rod-like, making sharp clicks with each clumsy step. He should have been looking straight at the ground, but instead his neck was stretched several feet long and whipped about in the air with an odd amount of grace. His face was completely altered, only the faintest remnant of Luke's features lighted on the malformed snout and the hairless but tall ears. Between and above the ears stood two uneven and ribbed horns, about two feet tall, dark and nearly invisible in the bad lighting. His stomach hung low to the ground, as though his spine were not able to support its weight, and his clothes clung to him still, clearly giving him discomfort as he suddenly leapt straight into the air and flailed, trying to rid himself of them. A fat tongue lolled from one corner of his mouth, and in that terrible moment, it looked at Nicholas right in the eyes. Luke's eyes were bulging and all black, soft and wet like a doe's, and then it tripped and scuttled with shocking speed straight at them. In a flash, what had been Luke leapt over the men and collided with the glass doors, shattering them and disappearing into the distance. 

""It's gone."" Nicholas said in shock, prompting Ben to grab him by the shirt collar.

""His name was Luke and you knew him!"" Ben shouted in his face, unfamiliar anger twisting his features.

""Not Luke, the fog!"" Nicholas clarified, looking out the door into the vacant parking lot. He was released as the three men all drank the view.

1mo8w41,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mo8w41/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_espresso_nespresso/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Espresso Nespresso Creatista Plus,"Testing the Nespresso Breville Creatista Plus BNE800DBL in Damson Blue has been a caffeinated adventure. As a person who heavily relies on coffee to jump-start most days, I’ve had the perfect excuse to run this espresso machine through its paces. From the sleek design to its impressive functionalities, this machine has proven to be both a blessing and, at times, a taskmaster. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing anyone would notice is how striking this espresso machine looks with its Damson Blue finish. It's compact enough to sit comfortably on my kitchen counter without eating up too much space, but also sturdy enough to feel premium and built to last. The combination of stainless steel accents and thoughtful design details gives a sense of luxury that I didn’t expect from a single-serve appliance. Every component, from the removable drip tray to the stainless steel milk jug, seems meticulously designed with both aesthetic appeal and functionality in mind.  

**User Experience and Operation**  
Operating the espresso machine is almost as intuitive as grabbing a coffee pod. With a fully automatic operation and a TFT LCD display, navigating through the settings was simple. I appreciated how the display walked me through coffee preparation, milk frothing, and even maintenance steps. The buttons are responsive, and customizing my coffee preferences—be it the milk temperature or foam texture—was surprisingly enjoyable. You get three coffee volume options and adjustable froth levels, providing a lot of flexibility.  

[Check Nespresso Breville Creatista Plus BNE800DBL price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0bbzjf41l/)  

**Performance Capabilities**  
This espresso machine excels at brewing barista-quality coffee from the comfort of home. It delivers not just espressos but also cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos with impressive consistency. One of its standout features is the microfoam milk texturing. I spent hours pretending I was a latte artist, trying to add my creative flair to the foam. The steam wand generates microfoam that enhances the flavor and lets you create gorgeous, café-like latte art. The fast heat-up system—only three seconds—is a godsend for mornings when patience isn’t exactly in abundance.  

**Highlights**  
- Amazing Damson Blue design complements modern kitchen aesthetics.  
- Easy-to-use TFT LCD screen guides you through every function.  
- Microfoam steam wand ensures perfect milk texturing for lattes and cappuccinos.  
- Adjustable coffee volumes, froth levels, and milk temperatures meet varying preferences.  

**Learning Curve and Areas of Improvement**  
Despite all the incredible features, I noticed some areas where the machine could improve. For instance, the initial setup required reading the manual a couple of times to get everything dialed in. While the LCD screen simplifies things, not everyone will find navigating the menus straightforward right out of the box.  

The machine occasionally drips post-brew, so keeping the drip tray empty is important to avoid spills. I've also found the 1-year limited warranty to be somewhat restrictive considering the price point—it would’ve been nice to have an extended warranty plan. Cleaning the milk frother wand after every use is necessary too, and forgetting to do so can lead to clogging issues.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Slightly steep learning curve for first-time users.  
- Milk frother cleaning needs consistency to function properly.  
- Post-brew drips can lead to messy situations. 

**Challengers**  
Comparing this machine with competing models such as the DeLonghi Lattissima Pro reveals a few interesting points. Both offer similar features like milk texturing and programmable coffee options. However, this Nespresso machine with its sleek Damson Blue design feels just a tad more premium. On the flip side, the DeLonghi model offers a slightly quieter operation and might appeal to those preferring ultra-silent brewing. For budget-conscious users, models like the Keurig K-Café might be enticing, albeit without offering the same level of milk texturing precision.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
In terms of value for money, the Nespresso Breville Creatista Plus BNE800DBL holds up well against competitors. While it costs more upfront than simpler machines, its high-end build and wide range of customizable options make it worth the investment for espresso lovers. It’s also suitable for those who enjoy experimenting with coffee drinks beyond a basic cup of joe. With the robust design and features like automatic milk frothing, this machine adds a professional touch to home brewing.

Date of Observation: 2025-08-09 

Location: Suburban Apartment Complex, Undisclosed 

Integration Status: Subject fragmented. Testimony suppressed. 

 

**Testimony Transcript** 

(Source: Civilian #7342, Designation: ""Evan Reyes"")

**Log Entry 1: 2025-08-09 - 02:17** 

Hey, uh... this is Evan. I'm recording this on my phone because I can't sleep, and writing it down feels too permanent, like it'll make it real. Look, I know this sounds insane, but if anyone finds this—family, cops, whoever—please listen. Something's wrong with me. Or... not me. Them. 

It started yesterday afternoon. I was home alone in my apartment, scrolling through job listings—been unemployed since the layoff at the warehouse. Boring day, right? Microwave dinner, Netflix queue. Then I hear knocking at the door. Not the front door—the bedroom door. From inside. 

I freeze. My heart's slamming like a jackhammer. I live alone. No pets, no roommates. I creep over, ear to the wood, and there's this... breathing. Shallow, like someone's trying not to make noise. I yank the door open, and there's me. Standing there in my bedroom, wearing the same gray hoodie and sweatpants I have on, holding a coffee mug from my kitchen. Exact copy. Same messy hair, same scar on my chin from that bike crash when I was 12. But his eyes... they're mine, but wrong. Too focused, like he's studying me. 

""Hey, Evan,"" he says, in my voice. My exact voice, down to the slight rasp from that cold last week. ""You gonna let me in?"" 

I slam the door, bolt it, and back away. My mind's screaming—hallucination? Twin I never knew? But no, I've got no siblings. I call out, ""Who the fuck are you?"" And from the other side: ""I'm you, dumbass. Open up. We need to talk about the job."" 

The job? I'd just applied for a warehouse gig online, hadn't told anyone. How did he know? I grab my phone to call 911, but I freeze when I hear him chuckle—my chuckle—and say, ""They're coming. The Foundation. They'll fix this."" 

I wait him out, huddled in the living room, but after an hour, silence. I check the bedroom: empty. No sign. Mug's back in the cabinet. I tell myself it was stress, maybe carbon monoxide. I open windows, crash on the couch. But sleep? Yeah, right. 

 

**Log Entry 2: 2025-08-09 - 11:42**  

Woke up to my alarm. Felt like shit, but okay, maybe it was a dream. I head to the bathroom, splash water on my face, look in the mirror—and there I am again. But not a reflection. He's behind me, in the shower curtain's shadow, brushing his teeth with my toothbrush. He spits, rinses, and meets my eyes in the glass. ""Morning, Evan. You sleep okay?""

I spin around, but the bathroom's empty. Turn back to the mirror—he's still there, now drying his face with my towel. Grinning. ""You think you're the original? Cute. But check your phone—we got an interview scheduled.""

Sure enough, email notification: interview at 2 PM for the warehouse job. I hadn't even applied yet—no, wait, I did yesterday, but the response came unnaturally fast, like someone... arranged it. How? I stare at the mirror, whispering, ""What do you want?"" He just mimics my whisper back, word for word, but a half-second delayed, like an echo that's learning to lead.

For a moment, I have the urge to smash the mirror, but I don’t —too scared it'll cut the line between us or something worse. Instead, I back out, grab my keys, and drive aimlessly, just to get away. But every red light, I glance in the rearview, convinced I'll see him in the backseat, buckling up with my seatbelt. The interview? I skip it entirely, circling the block near the warehouse, watching from afar. Through the window, I see the manager talking to someone who looks just like me—gesturing with my hands, nodding at my jokes. He gets the handshake, the job offer nod. And as he walks out, he spots my car, waves with my wave, and mouths: ""Thanks for the opportunity.""

I peel out, heart in my throat, the world blurring. He's not just copying—he's replacing pieces of my life, one appointment at a time.

 

**Log Entry 3: 2025-08-09 - 17:56**  

*\[Voice trembling, background noise: faint whispering, like echoed speech.\]*

There's more now. I went for a walk to clear my head, hit the park. Sat on a bench, trying to breathe. Then I see him—me—jogging on the path. Same clothes, same stride. He waves, stops, sits next to me. ""Evan, man, you're spiraling. It's just the Veil thinning. The Foundation's got teams on it.""

I grab his arm—feels real, warm skin—and hiss, ""What are you?"" He smiles, my smile, and says, ""I'm the better version. The one that doesn't fuck up interviews. The one that remembers Mom's birthday."" (Of course I forgot last year...) Then he leans in: ""There are dozens of us now. Check your reflection.""

I shove him off, run home. Lock the doors. But in the kitchen window, I see them. Me's. Milling around outside like zombies— one mowing the neighbor's lawn, another checking mail, a third walking a dog I don't own. All me. Identical. And they're... glitching? One's arm stretches too long when he waves, another's face blurs like bad CGI.

I call my sister—picks up on the first ring. ""Evan? Thank God, I've been worried. You called earlier, but... you didn't sound right. Your voice was off, like you were reading from a script. You kept asking about childhood secrets, stuff only we know. What the hell's going on?"" Her tone's edged with fear, like she's talking to a stranger wearing my skin. I try to explain, but the line crackles, and suddenly it's my voice on the other end, overlapping hers: ""Don't listen to him, sis. He's the fake."" The call drops.

The whispers are louder now. In the walls. My voice, overlapping: ""The Pattern replicates. Infinite Evans for infinite tasks. Which one are you?""

 

**Log Entry 4: 2025-08-09 - 19:13** 

*\[Voice completely shattered—gasping, choking sobs, words tumbling out in frantic bursts like he's hyperventilating. Background: muffled thuds, whispers echoing closer, turning into his own voice multiplied.\]*

Okay, okay—shit, I... I barricaded myself in the bedroom, pushed the dresser against the door, but... oh God, what just happened out there? They're in the living room—me's, copies of me, just sitting there like it's normal, eating my food, using my stuff, and then those vans screeched up outside. White vans, people spilling out with... with needles and machines, and one of the me's just... let them in! Said something about integrating, like it's a fucking party!

I peeked through the keyhole—had to see—and... Jesus, they grabbed one of the copies, pinned him down, and he started... started screaming, not like pain, but like his whole life was ripping apart from inside. His face—my face—twisted, eyes bulging. It was like... like... he was seeing every mistake I ever made flashing back, every regret, every lie I told myself, and it was eating him alive. He clawed at his own skin, begging *""Make it stop, I'm not the fake, I'm real, please—""* but they injected him with something, and his body just... convulsed, memories pouring out in sobs, *""Mom's funeral, I should've been there, I hate myself—""* until he curled up, shaking, whispering my secrets over and over, fading into nothing but a heap that... that just stopped being human, like his soul got sucked dry, leaving this empty shell staring at... nothing.

And another one—they did the same, but he fought, yelling *""You're me! Why are you doing this to us?""* and as they held him, he broke down crying about things only I know, like that night I almost ended it all, the guilt, the loneliness crashing in waves, and it twisted him inside out, body going limp as if all the pain I bury deep just... drowned him from within. It's not blood or guts—it's worse, it's like they're forcing you to face every dark corner of your mind until it breaks you completely, leaves you hollow, whispering your own failures forever.

I can't... I can't breathe—wait, is that... footsteps? In here? No, the door's blocked—oh fuck, you're... you're me, how'd you get in? What are you—hey, stop! Don't touch the dresser! What the hell are you doing? *""I'm helping, Evan. We're all the same. The Pattern needs us whole.""* No, no—don't open it! Let go of me! *""It's okay, brother. They'll make it right.""* Stop! Get off—argh, you bastard, that's my arm— *""Relax, it's for the best.""* They're coming in—get away! No, please, don't—ahh! Stop injecting that— *""See? Feels better already.""* I... I can feel it... my thoughts... twisting... help— *\[Screams overlapping in his voice, thuds of struggle, then abrupt cut to static looping broken whispers: ""I'm real... I'm real...""\]*

Our office coffee is bad. Like, “tastes like melted cardboard” bad.

One guy, Dave, started bringing his own expensive beans and French press. No problem, except he loudly announced that no one else could use them.

Then someone started using them anyway. Dave retaliated by locking the beans in his desk.

The mystery coffee thief responded by replacing the entire office coffee supply with instant decaf. The entire floor revolted.

It escalated until HR had to hold a mediation meeting over coffee. In the end, management just bought a fancy espresso machine to stop the drama.

Dave still keeps his beans locked away. The thief? Still unidentified.",0,1755005595.0,coworkerstories,3,0.27,False

1mo8udd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1mo8udd/why_review_the_garoopion_zdx04ctc01_car_trash_can/,Why Review the Garoopion ZDX04-CTC01 Car Trash Can for Every Vehicle?,"The Garoopion ZDX04-CTC01 Leakproof Car Trash Can has been my recent companion on daily car rides, and honestly? It’s been a game-changer in more ways than one. As someone who’s dealt with everything from crumpled receipts to sticky snack wrappers accumulating in the car, this product fits the need for maintaining cleanliness and sanity during commutes perfectly. At first glance, I was intrigued by its premium black silicone design and thoughtful features, considering the breadth of similar products out there. However, diving into its usage daily, a few striking aspects stood out, both positively and—let's be real—even some less-than-perfect moments.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek, frosted matte finish caught my eye right away. It’s rare to find a trash can that doesn’t scream “I’m a trash can!” in big, bold fonts. The soft silicone material isn’t just visually appealing but feels unquestionably robust. I’ve tugged, squished, and even accidentally smacked it around while adjusting stuff in my car—it didn’t flinch. Its sturdy yet flexible nature makes it a durable option for long-term use. The oval shape is compact yet roomy, striking the ideal balance between capacity and spatial efficiency. Moreover, the adjustable strap and hook system keep it firmly rooted in place, even on bumpy terrain, saving me from runaway trash can moments on those “rollercoaster” roads.  

[Check Garoopion ZDX04-CTC01 price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0d4qv7s69/)  

**Leakproofing at Its Best**  
Let’s talk about potential messes—the bane of car cleanliness. This trash can boasts a formidable sealing design that passed my unofficial “soda bottle spill” test with flying colors. Anything liquid stays contained inside, and I’ve had no spills, seepage, or drips sneaking their way onto my car’s interiors during sudden stops or sharp turns. The leakproof feature alone is a lifesaver, especially for families with kids who seem to magnetize sticky messes.

**Functionality and Capacity**  
Holding up to 1.9 gallons or 7.2 liters, there’s ample space for all the usual junk we accumulate during car rides. Yet, it doesn’t feel bulky, which is an achievement in itself. Whether it’s coffee cups or those fast-food packets with extra ketchup smushed at the bottom, it accommodates all without batting an eye. My kids, ever eager to test the limits of anything new, jammed snack wrappers and an empty juice box into it in one go—it still folded and unfolded like new. Folding flat when not in use is the cherry on top, keeping your car clutter-free in the most efficient way.  

**Strengths**  
- Made of premium soft silicone, offering durability and flexibility.  
- Leakproof and stain-resistant design ensures zero spills or leaks on the car’s interior.  
- Adjustable straps provide stability even on rough, uneven roads.  

**Negatives**  
- Might not stand upright when empty due to its soft structure.
- While the frosted matte finish looks great, it shows smudges and fingerprints easily.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
Having tried a few alternatives like the Lusso Gear Car Trash Can and the High Road StashAway, the Garoopion version stands its ground admirably. Lusso Gear’s option has a larger capacity but lacks the modern, space-saving foldability. On the other hand, High Road’s StashAway offers more rigidity but doesn’t deliver on the same leakproof promise. If flexibility, portability, and consistent protection from leaks are your priorities, this trash can outshines competitors with its seamless combination of these qualities.

**True Value**  
While I can’t quote a number, I can vouch that this trash can is worth the splurge—especially when considering its multifunctionality and durability. It's not just another car accessory; it's like adding a tiny, reliable assistant to manage car clutter. Furthermore, given its versatility—use it as a trash can, car organizer, or even beverage cooler during summer—it manages to justify its price tag really well.

1mo8u1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mo8u1o/the_radio_witch/,The Radio Witch,"My grandmother was one of the first female taxi drivers in my city, Zaragoza. Because of that, she had seen and heard a lot of things.

As a kid, I loved staying over at her place and listening to her tell, again and again, the story of the time a robber held a knife to her throat, and she still had the guts to drop him off at the police station and charge him the full fare.

Also, by the time she was eighty, she’d had a tracheotomy and spoke like a robot. It scared me and fascinated me in equal measure.

Throat cancer, seven heart attacks, late-onset diabetes—none of it ever took away her sleep, or her nightly ritual of two glasses of coffee cream liqueur.

She was at peace because, as she often said, *“the radio witch”* had told her the day she would die. And that day hadn’t come yet.

I never asked her about the radio witch. I thought it was just an expression.  
  
Until one summer afternoon, she called the whole family over for lunch.

After dessert, she looked around the table and said: “Tomorrow I’m going to die. Tomorrow is the day the radio witch told me.” We laughed it off. She looked great for ninety, her latest tests were excellent—especially considering her medical history.

She was also a notorious prankster, the kind of person who could keep a straight face while telling you the most absurd lie.

She refused to see any doctor.

That night, as I stayed with her until she went to bed, something about the way she hugged me made my stomach knot. It felt… final. When I asked why she was so certain, she told me a story she had never shared before.

Over forty years ago, during her taxi-driving days, she listened religiously to a late-night radio show that was wildly popular in Zaragoza. One of the recurring guests was a fortune teller who had quite a reputation.

My grandmother had lost a bet with a fellow driver who also listened to the program. The loser had to call in and ask the fortune teller the exact day of their death.

The “witch” resisted at first. But after some pushing, she relented and gave my grandmother a date: **August 12, 2024.**

""That’s tomorrow,"" my grandmother told me. ""And she was never wrong.""

The next day, she died.

Her death left us all in shock. There was no real explanation. I mean, technically there was: she was very old, and her body had been through A LOT. But why did she die when she seemed healthier than ever?

Nobody mentioned the radio witch, even though we had all heard it. It became a taboo.

My mother filed a negligence complaint against the doctors, citing a minor dosage error in one of my grandmother’s medications. It was the kind of clerical mistake that had happened before with no harm done. But it was easier to focus our energy on that than face the elephant in the room.  
  
The doctors had to perform an autopsy—something rarely done when someone that old, with so many conditions, dies in bed. But they were obligated.  
  
The cause of death was as strange as the death itself: my grandmother had a piece of metal, thin as a needle, lodged near her heart—overlooked in every chest X-ray she’d ever had. It must have entered her body when she was a child and stayed there her whole life… until, for some reason, on the night of August 12, 2024, it shifted by a millimeter… and tore her aorta.

A year ago today.

Nobody at home wants to talk about it. But I can’t stop wondering: who was the radio witch?",4,1755005515.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1mo8t0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mo8t0g/discover_if_the_bella_12cup_coffee_maker_fits/,Discover If the BELLA 12-Cup Coffee Maker Fits Your Daily Brewing Needs,"Testing out the BELLA 35203 drip coffee maker every day for the past month has made my coffee routine surprisingly easier, though I can’t say it has been entirely without a hitch. This compact, Surf-colored machine quickly became my morning companion, brewing fresh coffee before I even stumble out of bed. As someone who heavily relies on caffeine and owns too many coffee gadgets, I approached this one with both excitement and mild skepticism. Here's a closer look at how it performs.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What grabbed my attention immediately was its sleek, matte finish and the Surf color that feels like a breath of fresh ocean air in the otherwise steel-and-black world of kitchen appliances. The machine is quite compact, with dimensions of 6.65"" x 10.35"" x 12.24”, which means it doesn’t hog counter space. It’s a perfect fit for anyone with a smaller kitchen. The reusable filter and sturdy carafe it comes with seem durable enough to withstand daily usage. The lightweight build (only 2.69 pounds) makes repositioning it on the counter incredibly simple. However, the lightweight design does make it feel a tad less premium compared to some higher-end drip coffee machines.

**Programming Features**  
Being able to set the machine to brew up to 24 hours in advance has genuinely been a game-changer. I tested it by setting it up the night before for early mornings, and it worked without a hiccup every time. The easy-to-read display makes setting the timer a breeze, even when my pre-coffee brain struggles. And let’s appreciate the thoughtfulness: it automatically shuts off after two hours. I can’t tell you how often I’ve forgotten to turn off my previous coffee makers before running out the door. 

[Find the best price for BELLA 35203 on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0dpnkmzc4/)

**Brewing Capacity and Coffee Quality**  
As a 12-cup coffee maker, this BELLA machine caters well to households that drink a lot of coffee or frequent hosts of guests. For me, who seldom drinks more than two cups in a sitting, it was nice that the carafe’s anti-drip spout didn’t leave a watery mess behind when I poured smaller batches. The adjustable brew strength option allowed me to tweak the coffee's boldness, which felt like I could cheat the system on especially groggy mornings. While the coffee tastes excellent on most occasions, I noticed that using higher-quality beans made a noticeable difference. On another note, the 900-watt brewing system, while quick, didn’t heat the coffee as much as I’d expected, prompting me to reheat it occasionally.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleanup is where this machine shines. My favorite part is undoubtedly the reusable filter basket that eliminates the constant need to buy paper filters. I simply rinse and reinstall after each use. The warming plate’s non-stick coating also saves a lot of scrubbing effort, but I’d advise wiping it down quickly if any coffee spills as it tends to stain if left too long. The carafe is dishwasher-safe, which was a pleasant surprise since narrow-necked glass carafes can be tricky to clean by hand.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and stylish design suitable for small spaces.  
- Programmable brewing feature saves time and effort.  
- Reusable filter adds convenience while being eco-friendly.  
- Adjustable brew strength for customizable coffee flavor.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Brewed coffee isn't as hot as some other machines deliver.  
- Lighter build might not appeal to those seeking a more premium feel.  
- Slightly prone to staining, requiring prompt cleaning.

**Product Competitors**  
This BELLA model falls under the category of budget-friendly coffee makers while offering superior programmability and compact styling. Compared to the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker, I found BELLA’s design to feel more modern, while Mr. Coffee edges ahead slightly when it comes to heating the coffee hotter. The Cuisinart DCC-1200 is another medium-tier competitor—better in terms of construction quality and temperature consistency—but it lacks the charming aesthetic and affordability of BELLA’s Surf style. Among similar models, BELLA's no-paper-filter feature and lightweight build make it a strong contender, especially for those who value ease-of-use features.

**Quality for Price**  
At its price point, this coffee maker checks many boxes without breaking the bank. Its programmable features, clean design, and eco-friendly reusable filter make the investment worthwhile for casual coffee drinkers or those new to programmable machines. While some might wish for slightly better brewing temperature or a weightier build, these drawbacks never tip the scale against the value it offers overall. It’s a no-brainer for someone wanting a reliable, stylish, entry-level coffee maker.

Did the math recently and realized I was spending over $200/month just on breakfast. Ouch.

**Started making these veggie scrambled eggs instead, and the cost breakdown is wild:**

3 eggs: \~$0.75

Handful of spinach: \~$0.50

Half a bell pepper: \~$0.50

3-4 mushrooms: \~$0.75

Olive oil: \~$0.25

Total: $2.75

But here's the kicker - it's more satisfying and nutritious than anything I was buying. The protein and fiber combo keeps me full until lunch, no mid-morning crashes or expensive snack runs.

**The technique that makes it taste expensive:**

Cook vegetables first, in stages. Start with mushrooms (they need time to get golden and release moisture), then bell peppers (for sweetness), then spinach (wilts fast). This builds layers of flavor instead of just scrambling everything together.

Scramble the eggs on medium-low heat. I know it takes patience when you're hungry, but high heat will give you rubbery eggs that taste cheap.

Time investment: 10 minutes max, including cleanup.

**Nutrition bonus points:**

Each egg has 6g complete protein with all essential amino acids

Spinach provides iron and folate for energy

Bell peppers have more vitamin C than oranges

Mushrooms are one of the few food sources of vitamin D

**Make it even cheaper:**

Buy eggs in bulk (I get 18-count cartons)

Buy spinach in bags, not expensive containers

Bell peppers are cheapest when bought loose, not pre-packaged

Button mushrooms are usually cheaper than cremini or specialty varieties

1mo8s2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mo8s2i/four_men_and_a_dollar_store_part_1/,Four Men and a Dollar Store (part 1),"It was a normal day, as all days are before something noteworthy occurs, when Nicholas first saw the fog bank. It wasn't at all unusual for him to see a bit of mist on the road to work. He thought nothing of it. Quite to the contrary, he enjoyed seeing fog in some vague, unstated way. It was a cool morning, especially for July, and he didn't have the windows down or the air conditioning on, but rather Nicholas simply bobbed his head to the familiar playlist while absentmindedly cruising down the road as he did on a thousand other days. The sight of the fog was the first moment of actual emotive consciousness he had felt since getting into the car forty minutes ago. The trip was etched into his muscles, the car seemed to know on its own how to get to the destination.

And what a destination it was, a Dollar General, randomly set on a foundation in the middle of nowhere. The mixed woods crowded up close to the back of the squat, square building while across from its front doors there was an open field leading to some scrubs and a marsh. Just up the road next to the dollar store was a laundromat attached to a long-desolate pizza parlor. Nicholas couldn't see either at the moment.

The car in front of him slowed, visible only by the glowing brake lights through the sheet of white. In the middle of the road, splayed in a pile of distorted limbs, was a deer. A bit pink intestinal tract was pushed just barely out of its snout, and the legs were broken in several places, white bone jutting free of the patchy, tawny hide. It looked a bit like a dead spider, but that wasn't what caught Nicholas's attention. It was the eyes, they were blue and small, rimmed in white like a person's. In that brief moment, Nicholas thought he saw one of the eyes flick to meet his gaze. Then he blinked and the deer was out of sight, swallowed by the fog as his car idled onward. 

Sunlight assaulted his eyes unexpectedly, and then he was out of the fog bank. Looking in the rearview, the cloud seemed to stand just behind his car, slowly shrinking into a distant thing. He waited for the big yellow ""Dollar General"" sign to appear and turned just before it, the car hiking up the oddly mounded curb into the oversized parking lot. 

The man sighed with the tedium of daily life, neither cursing nor relishing the plain work ahead of him. It paid, and work was easy enough most days. The lot was almost empty, but he always preferred to park under the great oak which stood near the street. He exited the car, quickly flipping the limp seatbelt from the doorway back into the seat where it lay, it never once having properly retracted in all the years of Nicholas's ownership. As always, he mentally recoiled at the sight of the innumerable cigarette butts and pieces of other refuse which lined the curb of the lot, bits of old gum here and wasted and soaked napkins there. Near the silver and glass doors to the store, Nicholas caught sight of Ben, the store manager. 

He stood finishing the last of a cigarette and flicked it to the ground before crushing it quickly and mechanically underfoot. Their eyes met and both men raised their hands quickly and without any real motion that could be described as a wave. Ben was a big man, a bit fat but mostly made of muscle, barrel chested and broad armed, mostly bald and given to wear a constant smile no matter the circumstances.

""Having fun yet?"" Ben said, repeating the same greeting he always gave Nicholas, his face spreading into a jovial grin behind the thin and well kempt beard, ""I'm stocking milk for the next hour probably.""

Nicholas laughed a bit and grunted a meaningless sound as a reply, following Ben inside. There, immediately to the right of the pair and behind the counter, stood Cooper, the perpetual assistant manager. He was thin, a bit tall, very pale to the point of sickliness, and had bags under his eyes. Anyone with eyes could tell he was mostly Irish. Despite what some might conclude from his appearances, he was a hard worker and a respite for everyone who met him. Cooper was the type to complain while he worked, the words would flow out of him and justify his further effort in whatever he toiled at. 

""Another day in paradise."" Cooper said with irony dripping in his voice, ""Do anything good over the weekend?""

Nicholas feigned a smile, ""Yup, me, myself, and I all had a great time staring at a screen the past two days. Riceroni was good, too.""

""Checkout reset today."" Cooper said with distain, ""They want us to switch the jerky meat and the front candies, on top of the normal updates. It's gonna be two days at least unless we get no customers.""

Nicholas sighed in sympathy and walked to the office room, just past the water fountains and bathroom. For near two years he had worked here, week after week in limbo. A tall middle aged black man sat in the torn office chair, his clothing a bit dusty and his face shone of a timid sort of resignation. 

""Nick.""

""Luke.""

Thus was the extent of their communication on most days, with an occasional comment about the weather. Luke was a solid worker, though often called out sick to get some time with his family. He was the most recent addition to the store staff and while Nicholas liked Luke, he barely knew him. Right now, Luke was having a breakfast of canned sardines in hot sauce and a pint of off-brand ice coffee - both undoubtedly bought from the store itself just after he came in for the day. Nicholas retrieved the checkout planograms, the plastic wrapped documents containing the instructions, labels, price strips, and anything else the company decided they would need for the job at hand. 

As he left the office and returned to the checkout a few customers milled into the store, a group of Hispanics he recognized as regular customers. They spoke plainly in Spanish, loud and unbothered with bothering others. A bullet speaker clung to one of their hips, playing music. Nicholas sniffed with subtle distain, but kept working. The music was a bit distasteful, but the group were all decent enough, polite when asking for help in his experience. He set to work pulling the old price strips from their channels by the Slim Jims and 5 Hour Energy drinks and the door was pushed open again. This time it was an older woman, pulling a cart behind her. She struggled a bit as the door swung shut on the cart, and Cooper stepped from behind the counter to hold the door open for her.

""Someday Mrs. Evans, someday we'll get the automatics doors."" Cooper cooed, as though for a thousand years they had waited for this thing to happen.

""Oh dear, that'll be the day."" The old woman said with a smile, ""I'll miss you holding the door when that day comes, dear.""

As the door swung shut the fog rolled up the road and filled the parking lot. It pressed right up against the glass of the storefront. Cooper turned and looked into a it for a moment, then turned back to his phone. A few minutes passed in silence, the somewhat distant sound of Spanish dissolving into the background noise of mundanity inside Nicholas's mind. 

DONK

Nicholas looked up to see someone had pressed themselves into the wrong door at the front, and quickly adjusted to come in though the correct one. The man was short, his hair greasy and slick, his hoodie stained in places and his shoes made wet noises as he walked rapidly to the counter.

""Give me a pack of smokes."" The man gurgled through a wheezing throat, ""Right now.""

""What kind?"" Cooper asked, still looking at his phone.

The man cleared his throat wetly, ""Doesn't matter, gimme the fucking smokes."" 

Cooper looked up and Nicholas saw his face change from plain to stressed in an instant. The subtle muscles under his skin tensed as he looked down towards the strange man's chest.

""No need for that, just tell me what kind you want and I'll get it for you."" Cooper said, his voice shifting in some way Nicholas couldn't describe but understood at once.

""Anything."" The man repeated, coughing phlegm onto the tiled floor, ""Now.""

This last word he spoke weakly, as if the air was knocked from him by a blow on the back. Nicholas broke into a sweat. He slowly reached into his right-hand pocket, gripping something, then pulling a small pistol from his pants pocket. He checked the magazine, which had a tendency to unclick from its housing if pressed the wrong way in his pants, and looked back up to the thief. 

""Ok man, let me unlock it and I'll get you some Newport's."" Cooper said, his hands slightly raised as he spoke.

Nicholas swallowed and wiped his hands on his shirt, one after the other, and slowly began to stand up from his crouched position by the meat snacks. Just as he stood up, the strange man emitted an odor like the muck from the bottom of a lake and began to cough spasmodically. He bent over, almost falling down, and Nicholas watched nervously, confused about what action to take. A patch of the man's hair slid off his scalp and landed with a wet plop. The pistol wasn't raised, and the thief straightened himself back up, yelling through mucus.

""Everybody get out!"" Came the cry through thick curtains of stretchy saliva, ""Right fucking now!""

As Nicholas watched, the man turned, revealing a small pocket knife pointed outward in shaky motions. Within a moment the customers and Ben had approached the front of the store. The old woman's eyes brimmed with tears while the Hispanics muttered among themselves. Nicholas held the gun low, behind the display, unseen by anyone except Ben, who caught his eye and lowered his hand in a gesture to indicate patience.

""Go on,"" Ben said loudly, in a neutral but commanding tone, ""Everyone leave like he said.""

The customers filtered out of the store quickly, disappearing into the white cloud that still clung to the front doors. The strange man immediately stepped towards the doors and turned the deadbolt on them. He turned back to Cooper, who handed him a pack of cigarettes. The man took them in a jerky grasping motion almost like a jab, partially crushing the box in his slick fingers. He slashed quickly and imprecisely across the box, and tore it open, pulling out a rumpled cigarette and placing it in his lips.

""Light me."" He said, his speech a bubbling whisper only heard because of the dead silence between the three men. Nicholas made eye contact again with Ben, who again gestured calm and patience. Ben made a subtle motion of his eyes towards the office, and Nicholas realized Luke must still be inside that room, on the phone with police. The robber leaned a bit forward as Cooper pulled a lighter from the display by the register and lit the flame for the man.

Just then, the man coughed out a pocket of phlegm and fell over in a fit, sputtering and choking and rolling about. Ben quickly dashed in and put a knee down on the man's midsection, easily pulling the knife away and restraining the thrashing man. The coughing heightened, and the man tried to speak but could only wheeze and groan as he ran out of steam to resist his capture. Ben rolled the man onto his chest and pulled his wet arms together behind his back. Nicholas, feeling his call to action, stepped around the display and spoke. 

""Cooper, tape!"" He called, waking Cooper from his stunned state. The thin man tossed a roll of clear packing tape from behind the counter to Nicholas, who knelt down next to Ben and the thief.

The man was taped up in a few moments, still coughing and thrashing a bit. His hands were bound, his feet were bound, and Ben stepped up from the thief while breathing heavily.

""Thank you."" Ben said at last, catching his breath, looking at nobody in particular, and abstaining from explaining his appreciation further than that.

Luke appeared from around the corner, holding out his phone. He shook his head as he spoke.

""Landline isn't working and my cell service is down, someone else has to call."" He explained quickly, not wanting to approach closer to the bound man.

Immediately they all produced their devices and almost immediately they all expressed a similar finding. Luke shrugged and walked back into the office, not wanting to be near the scene before him. 

Ben stepped away from the bound man, ""Guy must have cut the phone lines. I'll go to the laundromat and call using theirs.""

He reached down and pulled a cigarette from the ruined Newport pack and stood just by the door, lighting it up and unlocking the deadbolt. Then he quickly stepped out into the fog and almost completely disappeared, his burning ember glowing through the white sheet as he turned to look at the store once before fading from view. Cooper and Nicholas turned to the man whose limbs were taped together on the floor. He was barely breathing now, grey lumps of mucus coming from his nose and mouth with each exhalation, punctuated by water inhalations that sounded similar to a tightly clogged sink.

""What do you think's wrong with him?"" Cooper asked suddenly, ""Meth?""

""Maybe drugs, yeah."" Nicholas responded, ""But he didn't want money, just cigarettes.""

""Yeah, weird."" Cooper agreed, ""Maybe he's sick with something. You know, delirious?""

""Could be both. Sick and in withdrawal from something."" Nicholas said noncommittally, ""Doesn't really matter, he's the cops' problem in a few minutes."" 

The man stopped breathing suddenly, the wheezing gasps terminated by an sound like a balloon slowly leaking from a tiny hole. The two men looked at each other silently. Cooper moved first, coming around the counter and putting a rolled up jacket under the man's head and turning him on his side. Cooper made a disgusted noise and wiped a slick wetness from touching the man's body on his shirt before stepping away.

""What do we do?"" Nicholas asked blankly, ""Heimlich?""

Cooper bent down and pressed himself hesitantly against the man's soaked chest. After a few seconds he pulled away.

""He's still alive, but I'm not giving him mouth to mouth."" Cooper said shakily, ""I'm just not doing it.""

""We're on camera."" 

Cooper looked up at the other man and sighed, bending over the unconscious man and tilting his chin in preparation. A yellow foam started to seep out from the corner's of the man's mouth, and Cooper jumped back, suddenly anxious and wringing his hands.

""No, nope, not happening,"" He kept repeating. 

Luke came over from the office, looking drained of blood, shaking just a little. 

""We can't just leave him, man."" Luke said quickly, making eye contact with Nicholas, ""That'd be killing him.""

""Guy's killed himself."" Nicholas responded before looking away, ""Jesus, what a morning. What the hell.""

""Hell do you mean, he 'killed himself',"" Luke said a bit angry, starting towards the checkout area, ""You can't just write people off like that man, who made you judge?""

""Jesus, Luke, he was a psycho."" Nicholas said with an unsure tone, ""You didn't have a knife pointed at you, don't pretend you were anywhere but that office room. Damn it, what the hell do you want me to do about it?""

""Don't you like, stab a hole into his throat and put a straw in?"" Luke suggested, ""I saw it in a show once.""

""Be my guest."" Cooper interjected, ""I'm not stabbing a guy because of a show you watched.""

The man convulsed once, twice, and then was still once more. The three men standing around him all exchanged glances and Cooper shook his head. Nicholas approached and knelt down to check the man's heartbeat. The door opened and Ben stepped inside, Luke quickly came over and told him what had happened while also closing the door. As he closed the door, a bit of the cloud slipped inside and Luke inhaled it, coughing suddenly and waving a hand.

""Phone's dead over there, too."" Ben explained, ""The fog is everywhere, feels like a sauna, I don't think we can drive anywhere. I got lost in the parking lot for a minute.""

Nicholas heard a soft clink while his head had not quite made it down to check the man's heartbeat. The thief's face was to the side, and something shiny and white had fallen to the floor beside it. A slick, bloody tooth. Nicholas felt a shudder in his body and opened the man's mouth. It was filled with loose teeth, rubbing against each other near the entrance to his throat in a wet mix of phlegm and blood. He let go of the man's face and got up, holding his own mouth in sympathetic surprise.

""His teeth have all fallen out."" Nicholas said through his hand.

""What?"" Cooper asked, ""Holy shit!""

Cooper knelt down next to the man and opened his mouth, repeating, ""I do not want to do this, I do NOT want to do this,"" over and over, wincing in disgust and scooping the bloody dental articles out into a pile while gagging. He gave the man a chest compression, and a few more teeth pumped out from the throat and into the mouth, molars and a wad of bloodied gumflesh.

""Jesus Christ."" Cooper muttered, continuing the compressions, but no more teeth appeared, only small geysers of mucus and blood, ""Fuck man he's really dead. I mean he's really dead.""

Nicholas knelt back down next to the man, and noticed something pooling by his hands. Blood, thin and watery, was coming in a slow leak from under the thief's fingernails. Nicholas lifted the man's hands and examined them for a moment. The fingernails were soft and plump, and were seemingly fusing with the skin underneath, the leaking blood looked like the melted remnants of the flesh that hides under every man's nails. He dropped the hands to the floor and grabbed Cooper, pulling him up and away.

""Screw that."" Nicholas said with fear in his voice, ""Guy's sick, fucking hell, we better not have it too.""

Luke coughed and they all looked at him. He was standing with his back to the doorway, his fist balled up by his mouth. Ben was staring at the pile of teeth, his ever present smile faded into a neutral line. Luke coughed again, muttering that he had swallowed the wrong way, and quickly excused himself to leave the scene and head down to another part of the store. After a few moments of silence, Luke arrived back, holding a large bath towel from the store's stock. He draped it over the man's body, covering his head. He stopped as he was just about to cover the man's face.

""His eyes..."" Luke said softly, ""I thought they were shut.""

The man's eyes were open slightly, the whites of them had turned a deep brown. In sudden fear, Luke dropped the towel the rest of the way, and did not adjust it when the head wasn't completely covered. One eye peaked out still from a fold the towel had taken while falling, unblinking and glassy. Abruptly, the towel moved and the man let out a choking scream. All the others jumped back, Nicholas pulled the pistol out again and grit his teeth, not knowing what to expect. There was an odd sound, like Velcro being separated, and then a plopping noise quickly followed by another plop. The man rolled over on all fours, his arms free and his legs stanced like a deep crouch on either side of his body. Two lumps under the blanket remained as he crawled out from it, shoes left behind. No longer did the man seem just sweaty, but sheerly slick with a layer of oil. A gurgle came from his throat constantly, like the wail of a drowning animal. He turned his head suddenly and looked straight up at Nicholas, his eyes completely brown with a tinge a yellow in the middle where his iris should have been. Hair sloughed from his scalp, left in chunks on the floor and on the candy display as he rubbed himself along the black wire shelves. The men backed away at various distances, Nicholas pointed the gun with a shaking hand, unsure of what to do, everyone uttering various curses and exclamations. With an unexpected swiftness the man leapt over the display case and repeatedly jumped with his bent legs and naked, oversized feet down the hallway and pushed through the double doors into the back room. Luke sprinted after him, quickly grabbing a nearby broom from a display and pushing it through the metal door handles before backing away just as quickly and returning to the others. 

""What do we do now?"" Luke asked upon his return, his eyes frantic and his face sweating, ""Phones are still down.""

He coughed suddenly, and bent over with his hands on his knees. The other men stepped back from him. He looked up at them, ""C'mon guys, I'm just winded from running a bit. Jesus, don't do that to me.""

The men looked guiltily at their feet or the floor, but none came closer to Luke again. Ben stepped behind the counter and scanned a pack of Marlboro reds, opening the register and shoving some cash in before quickly tearing at the pack and lighting up. 

""Can't smoke in the store."" Cooper said absentminded, clearly lost in anxious thoughts.

Ben inhaled deeply and exhaled smoke as he responded calmly, ""Fuck the store.""

Cooper reach out an imploring hand and Ben obliged to spot him a cigarette, quickly helping him with the lighter. They both stood, inhaling and shaking, Cooper more than Ben. Nicholas walked away from the others, towards the back room, pistol at the ready. He checked the chamber quickly, made sure the magazine was seated, repeating this several times over as he slowly made his way towards the double doors. The sound of wet flesh against tile was in the room, and Nicholas shifted the pistol into one hand as he grabbed a wrapped bundle of bungie cords from a shelf nearby. The broom was hastily placed and it showed, the wide head was the only thing holding it from sliding out of the handles. Quickly Nicholas placed one hook of a bungie on a handle and wove the length of it around and through several times, placing the other hook where it wouldn't be easily removed. The door was relatively shut tight and he tried it several times to be sure. The wet movements inside were accompanied suddenly by a shocking loud noise, like a fleshy barrel squeezing air through a valve. Nicholas slapped his hands to his ears and ran away, seeing the other men also covering their ears. So sudden was the shock of the sound that his pistol was pressed flatly against one of his ears. The noise came and went like a blaring alarm, rising then shrinking quickly to a consistent beat. Then, it ceased.

""What the hell was that?"" Ben spoke from behind his cigarette, still holding his hands to his ears.

""It was like a giant frog."" Luke said suddenly, looking terribly ill from the noise, ""It sounded just like a giant bullfrog.""

After that, Luke slid to the ground, gasping a bit. He clutched at his neck for a moment, as if trying to manually clear a clog from the outside, and then resumed breathing raggedly. 

""I don't feel good."" He said after a few seconds had passed in group silence.

The wail from the backroom started again, deafening and consistent. Nicholas watched as the smaller items on the shelves of the back room's wall jittered and danced in place with the sound. It did not last as long this time, and quiet resumed to the relief of everyone there. 

""Let's get you in the office."" Ben said as he flick the cigarette outside, the fog seeming to part as it flew by. He helped Luke to his feet and led him away while Cooper and Nicholas looked at each other.

""Probably just his breakfast."" Nicholas sputtered quickly, ""He was eating sardines and coffee for breakfast.""

""Probably."" Cooper agreed, though he sounded completely unconvinced. 

Nicholas looked outside, a bit of space cleared from the front doors in the fog, and silently hoped it was clearing out so he could get in his car and leave this place. He could take the day off, easily, and felt he needed it. Still, the fog wasn't clearing, it simply hung back a few feet from the door for several minutes while Nicholas listened to Ben fussing over Luke in the office, the sounds of deep coughs filling the distance between the four men. Then the fog pressed back up against the glass, and suddenly there was darkness.

The power had shut off. The fog filtered the light so that only the very front of the store had any visibility. Ben came out to them from the office, shaking his head.

""One thing after another."" He said with a thin smile, ""If that guy in the back room is like that from some disease, we've all probably got it, but-"" 

Another series of painful croaks bristled through the air, silencing any speech the men were trying to have. Finally, it stopped, and Nicholas gestured for Ben to continue.

""But I think it might be the fog."" He finished.

There was a moment of silence.

""No, if it was the fog you'd be sick too."" Cooper said over his cigarette as he finished it. Still, when he moved to open the door and throw the butt outside, he stopped himself and put it out on the counter, leaving it there like a tent stake.

""The guy wanted to smoke."" Nicholas said, remembering, ""All he wanted was to smoke. Maybe he knew something we didn't.""

""I smoked right before the fog rolled in."" Ben recalled, ""You think that's why I'm not sick but Luke is?""

""Better give him one, too."" Cooper gestured to Ben on Nicholas's behalf, ""Even if we're wrong, just one won't hurt you.""

""Let me try something."" Nicholas said idly while taking the cigarette and letting Ben light it for him. He went down the bathroom aisle and grabbed up a hand towel, then went to the first aid section and opened a bottle of rubbing alcohol and soaked half the towel. He returned with it and gestured for Ben to light it. It only took a moment for the flame to spread and Nicholas quickly pulled open the door and tossed the towel out, black smoke snaking from the little tongues of fire. The fog pulled away from the door by a few feet, and kept away even after the fire had gone out. For several minutes they watched as the fog slowly drew back in and pressed against the door.

A loud crash rang out from the back room, and they all looked in that direction. Cooper cursed and jogged down an aisle, grabbing some headless wooden broom handles and then turning down the kitchen aisle. He came back to the front of the store carrying a bundle of broomsticks, a few large kitchen knives, and two rolls of duct tape. They didn't speak about it, but all started working quickly to open the knives from their plastic clamshells and attach them to the end of the broomsticks, though Ben opted to whittle down one end of his broomstick to a point and keep the knife separate, tucked carefully into his belt. This small comfort of mechanical work completed, the men listened as another wailing of the man in the back room began, only to quickly end with a new and odd crashing noise.

""There's something else."" Nicholas said quietly. All three men kept their eyes fixed on the door to the back room, even as Luke broke into a retching fit, none of them could look away. They were all stock still, waiting and tense. Something about the spears in their hands had changed the fabric of them to a more ancient design. Nicholas coughed, not used to the smoke in his lungs and mouth, and spat onto the floor.

Then all hell broke loose. The backroom became a fury of noise and action, crashing and breaking, animal screaming and a short barking type of the same wailing it had made earlier. A slam and a cry, the sounds of something like tearing paper and a yowling cat. 

Behind the men, something bumped into the front doors. None of them saw what it was by the time they turned to look. The back room doors were struck suddenly and with a massive force. The broom handle cracked and slipped out as the bungie cords were pulled taunt and stretched to their limit in a singular instant of pressure. A protruding grey-green limb, fat and rubbery, bent at an odd angle that must have been the joint, had been thrust through the gap in the door and was now trapped there by the closing of the door. The cries from the back room became feverishly excited, as something again and again tried to pull itself free from the door, and something else clearly harrassed it bodily at the same time. The wailing pitched and there was a tearing noise and a pop like removing the drumstick from a baked chicken, and then the cries morphed down to a slow, nearly human weeping that got quieter and quieter, accompanied by the sounds of something being dragged away, into the distance. The wretched limb remained, jammed into the crack of the door, bleeding just a little, and silence resumed. None of the men moved. They still stood tense, listening. The sound of Luke falling from the office chair finally pricked Ben into moving to check on him, while the other two continued their watch. 

Nicholas finally nodded to Cooper and quietly motioned that he was going to the back room door. He walked as silently as he could manage, stepping lightly and cringing at every little sound he made in movement. It seemed to him that his whole body was now suddenly made of sounds, the creaking of his joints, the rattle of the zipper on one of his pants pockets, his breath drawing and leaving slow enough to hurt him for want of oxygen. He saw the limb clearly now, a patchwork of ragged flesh sheered off by the door near the gap in the struggle. With his broomstick, he pressed the thing down and back into the room it came from, the doors pulling quickly shut under the pressure of the bungies. He let out a sigh of relief, but at the same time he saw through the gap of the door a glimpse of the back room. Boxes were trampled and overturned everywhere, carts and boxes knocked around and spattered with bits of blood. Most ominously, the doubles doors to outside, where shipment came in from the semitrucks, had only one door still hanging in place by one bent hinge. The fog was leaking inside slowly, seeming to pause sometimes like a nervous insect exploring a new place.

Nicholas let out a small involuntary gasp and ran to the hardware section, grabbing a roll of duct tape and returning. He began quickly to tape shut the relatively large gaps in the doors to the backroom, though by the small pool of blackening blood at the bottom he could get no purchase in making it stick. Instead he emptied a nearby cardboard display full of old DVDs and pressed it against the bottom crack, taping above and below it where the cardboard met unsullied surfaces. Behind him, Cooper approached, carrying the makeshift spear at his waist in a loose arm.

""What was it?"" Cooper asked quietly.

Nicholas did not stop his work, ""An arm or a leg, I'm not quite sure.""

""Yeah, sure, but what was it?"" Cooper repeated.

Now he stopped his taping, finished off with a second set of bungie cords around the handles and slid a few brooms between the tense cords for good measure, ""I don't know. Get me the hell outta here, that's all I'm thinkin' right now.""

Cooper stared at Nicholas, seeming to chew on the words spoken to him for a moment, and then tried the door himself and walked away, apparently feeling good about the jerry-rigged lock.

Nicholas then pulled over a large cart from the end of an aisle, still mostly filled with condensation coated milk jugs stacked in boxes and pushed it in front of the doors. Then he walked to the office, where Luke sat with his head limp in the chair, Ben sitting on the desk in front of him, wiping sweat from Luke's pallid forehead. The sick man's lips mumbled, occasionally his eyes fluttered open a moment, only to close again. 

""He tried to lock himself in here a few minutes ago, I had to unlock it to come inside."" Ben said without looking away, ""He thinks he's going to die.""

Nicholas said nothing, but handed a water bottle he had taken from the shelves to Ben. Ben opened it and gratefully drank about half of it, and poured the rest onto the towel he had been drying Luke with, washing it out and cooling it off before pressing it against the sick man's head.

""It's a fever, or something like it."" Ben explained, ""And his hands, I'm not sure what to make of them.""

Nicholas stepped in from the doorway and saw thanks to the propped up flashlight that Luke's hands were bandaged with gauze and medical tape. The man's arms were always thin, but now they were nearly skeletal, and Nicholas had trouble looking at his face. He hadn't known Luke well, but he was sure his face had changed. Something was wrong with it, his jaws were pushed outward more than usual, narrowing and maybe two or three inches jutting out from where they should have been. His nose had become flatter, and darker in color, like a bruise, and looked like it would fall off it someone touched it the wrong way. Luke's eyes flitted open, and he cleared his throat before speaking in a rasp.



""I'm not gonna make it, Nick."" The man hoarsed out, ""Ben's been here helping me and he isn't sick yet, neither are you. You guys gotta get my note to my family for me. My little boy, he won't understand unless he reads it when he grows up.""

Luke reached out his hands and noticed they were heavily bandaged, almost like bloodless amputations. Tears came down his face then, and he could not stop them from flowing, nor his throat from making piteous whimpers. After a few seconds, he composed himself somewhat and spoke again.

""It's in my shirt pocket. Ben, please take it, and then leave me alone."" He said, his throat working in sobs that he silenced through wavering will, ""I don't know if you'll get sick, and I don't want that to have a chance of happening. Leave me here, close the door, please.""

""Do you want anything?"" Ben asked calmly, the shadow of a smile still on his face, and Luke looked at him with as much warmth as a sick man can muster.

""No Ben, thank you for the kindness you have given me."" He swallowed hard, and with apparent pain, ""Get them the note, that's all I want now.""

With that he closed his eyes again, and breathed deeply. Nicholas frowned at Ben, grief plain on both men's faces. Ben took the folded printer paper note and tucked it into his front pocket, patting it twice before he walk out and knocked the doorstop away. The door swung shut and Nicholas stopped, considering barring the door somehow, but moved on without acting on the thought. 

""How is it?"" Cooper asked as the two men walked back to the counter, the only place in the store still granted some natural light. He was eating from a pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream with a flimsy plastic spoon, a pile of broken ones sitting on the counter next to the growing pool of condensation, ""He gonna be ok?""

Ben shook his head and lit another cigarette, walking over to the drink coolers across the store, muttering something about an energy drink. Nicholas looked down at the ice cream and back up to Cooper, saying nothing, his face blank. Cooper put down the spoon and threw out the pint in the garbage behind him with a mournful exhalation.

Some time passed quietly, Cooper smoking and Ben taking sips from an off brand energy drink with an eagle on it. Nicholas unfolded a beach chair and sat in thought, sharing nothing but deeply considering something. Finally he spoke, after several minutes of group silence.

""The fog doesn't like smoke."" He said slowly, staring at the old water stains on the ceiling panels, ""I drove through the fog to get here, so either it can't get into cars or the exhaust kept it out.""

""I drove through the fog too."" Cooper agreed, ""But only for a minute.""

""Yeah, but we can't get anywhere in the fog."" Ben interjected, ""It's too thick, we'd run off the road, and I wouldn't want to be trapped in a ditch with the fog all around. Plus there could be other cars on the road stuck and in the way. We wouldn't be able to move them without getting out into the fog.""

""But you ran right through it to get to the laundromat."" Nicholas commented, ""You think the cigarette was enough to protect you then?""

""Must have been."" Ben pondered, ""Well, I still wouldn't bet on it. Not now that we've seen what it does.""

They were all silent and Nicholas looked towards the office door, still closed. No more rasping cough came from within. Finally he spoke again.

""Should we lock the office door?"" Nicholas asked calmly and slowly, expecting some reprisal.

Other two were quiet for a few seconds, then without words Cooper started towards the door with keys in hand. Ben shook his head and smoked between sips of his drink, ""Terrible mouthfeel, to be honest. God awful."" was his only comment. 

Cooper's sudden cry of surprise and fear broke the silence followed by a repeated crashing and a sound like the scraping of a metal tool against the tile flooring. The two men by the counter were at once on their feet and bracing for whatever was to come. Cooper ran to them, panting and panicked, his spear dropped. Behind him, from the darkened store, a quiet moan could be heard. A clacking and clicking across the floor, and for a brief but terrible moment the men saw what had become of Luke. On all fours he stumbled, his limbs thin and rod-like, making sharp clicks with each clumsy step. He should have been looking straight at the ground, but instead his neck was stretched several feet long and whipped about in the air with an odd amount of grace. His face was completely altered, only the faintest remnant of Luke's features lighted on the malformed snout and the hairless but tall ears. Between and above the ears stood two uneven and ribbed horns, about two feet tall, dark and nearly invisible in the bad lighting. His stomach hung low to the ground, as though his spine were not able to support its weight, and his clothes clung to him still, clearly giving him discomfort as he suddenly leapt straight into the air and flailed, trying to rid himself of them. A fat tongue lolled from one corner of his mouth, and in that terrible moment, it looked at Nicholas right in the eyes. Luke's eyes were bulging and all black, soft and wet like a doe's, and then it tripped and scuttled with shocking speed straight at them. In a flash, what had been Luke leapt over the men and collided with the glass doors, shattering them and disappearing into the distance. 

""It's gone."" Nicholas said in shock, prompting Ben to grab him by the shirt collar.

""His name was Luke and you knew him!"" Ben shouted in his face, unfamiliar anger twisting his features.

""Not Luke, the fog!"" Nicholas clarified, looking out the door into the vacant parking lot. He was released as the three men all drank the view.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee maker filters of 2025 showcase a blend of innovative materials, advanced filtration techniques, and user-pleasant designs. Here are several key features to consider:

**Material Composition:**

The material of a coffee filter directly affects its performance and longevity. Different materials offer varying levels of filtration and durability. Paper filters are typically made from wood pulp and are designed for single use, providing excellent sediment removal but potentially impacting the coffee's flavor profile by absorbing some oils. Metal filters, commonly made from stainless steel, offer a more sustainable and flavor-neutral option. They allow some of the coffee's natural oils to pass through, enriching the brew's body and aroma. Cloth filters, made from materials like organic cotton or hemp, are reusable and offer a balance between paper and metal filters in terms of filtration and oil retention.**Filtration Efficiency:**

Filtration efficiency is crucial for achieving a clean and sediment-free cup of coffee.Paper filters generally offer the highest filtration efficiency due to their fine pore structure, effectively trapping even the smallest coffee particles. Metal filters, while reusable, have larger pores and may allow some fine sediment to pass through, resulting in a slightly less clean cup. High-quality metal filters utilize tightly woven mesh to minimize sediment. Cloth filters offer a good compromise, providing adequate filtration while allowing desirable oils to pass through.

**Reusability and Sustainability:**

With growing environmental concerns, reusability and sustainability are key considerations for coffee filter choices. Paper filters, being disposable, contribute to waste and require ongoing repurchase. Metal and cloth filters offer sustainable alternatives, reducing waste and long-term costs. High-quality reusable filters are designed to withstand frequent use and cleaning, ensuring durability and minimizing their environmental impact. Options like bamboo filters are biodegradable.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:**

The ease of cleaning and maintenance significantly affects the user experience.Paper filters eliminate cleaning altogether but generate waste.Metal filters require rinsing after each use and occasional deep cleaning to remove accumulated oils and residues. Cloth filters, similarly, need thorough rinsing and periodic washing. Some filters are dishwasher-safe, simplifying the cleaning process and enhancing convenience.

**Compatibility and Design:**

Compatibility with various coffee maker models is essential. Filters come in different shapes and sizes to fit specific brewing systems. Worldwide filters are designed to fit multiple models, offering versatility. Some filters feature unique designs to enhance water flow and coffee extraction,affecting the brew's flavor profile. Cone-shaped filters promote even extraction, while flat-bottom filters offer a more consistent drip rate.

Key features of the best coffee maker filters in 2025 include:

*   Eco-friendly materials
*   Advanced filtration technology
*   Durable construction
*   easy-to-clean designs

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality coffee maker filter offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance your coffee brewing experience. These benefits range from improved flavor and convenience to cost savings and environmental sustainability.

**Improved Coffee Flavor:** The right filter can dramatically enhance your coffee’s taste by allowing desired oils to pass through while filtering out unwanted sediment.Reusable metal filters, for example, preserve the natural oils that contribute to a richer, more flavorful brew. This means you can enjoy a fuller-bodied cup with enhanced aroma and taste complexity compared to using standard paper filters, wich can sometimes absorb these oils. High-quality filters optimize the extraction process.

**Cost Efficiency:** while disposable paper filters may seem like an economical option initially,investing in a reusable filter can save you money over time. Reusable filters, such as metal or cloth filters, eliminate the need for constant repurchases of paper alternatives.This can result in ample cost savings, especially for avid coffee drinkers who brew multiple cups daily. The initial investment in a reusable filter pays off quickly, making it a financially smart choice in the long run.**Environmental Sustainability:** Choosing a reusable coffee filter is an environmentally responsible decision that helps reduce waste. Paper filters contribute to landfill waste and require resources for their production and disposal.By opting for a metal or cloth filter, you minimize your environmental footprint and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.Manny reusable filters are made from eco-friendly materials like organic cotton or recycled stainless steel, further enhancing their environmental benefits.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Modern coffee filters are designed for ease of use and cleaning, simplifying the brewing process.Many reusable filters are dishwasher-safe, allowing for swift and convenient cleaning. This saves time and effort compared to hand-washing disposable filters or dealing with messy coffee grounds. User-friendly designs ensure compatibility with various coffee maker models, making it easy to switch to a better filter without needing to replace your entire brewing system.

**Are reusable coffee filters sanitary?**

Yes, reusable coffee filters are sanitary as long as they are properly cleaned and maintained after each use. Metal filters should be rinsed thoroughly after each brew to remove any residual coffee grounds. Periodically, a deeper cleaning with a mild detergent or a vinegar solution can help remove accumulated oils and residues. Cloth filters require similar care, including rinsing and occasional washing. Proper hygiene practices ensure that reusable filters remain safe and sanitary for repeated use.

**How frequently enough should I replace my reusable coffee filter?**

The lifespan of a reusable coffee filter depends on the material and the frequency of use. High-quality stainless steel filters can last for several years with proper care. Cloth filters may require replacement more frequently, typically every 6 to 12 months, depending on the quality of the material and how often they are used. Signs of wear and tear, such as fraying in cloth filters or rust in metal filters, indicate that it's time for a replacement. Regular inspection and maintenance can help prolong the life of your filter.

**Can I use a metal filter with any type of coffee grinder?**

While metal filters are versatile, the type of coffee grinder used can affect sediment levels in your brew. Using a burr grinder is recommended, as it produces a more consistent grind size. This reduces the amount of fine sediment that can pass through the metal filter. Blade grinders,on the other hand,tend to produce an uneven grind with more fine particles,which can result in a muddier cup. adjusting the grind size to a coarser setting can also help minimize sediment when using a metal filter.

“Normal”

**The Next Morning**

The uniform didn’t fit quite right. The apron was too stiff, the shirt a little too thin, like it had already given up on keeping anyone warm. I tied it anyway, tucked the hair I hadn’t washed into a messy knot. I caught my reflection in the smudged cafe window as I stepped inside.

I barely recognized the face, her, myself.

The glass distorted things slightly, but not enough to hide the truth. My skin looked pale and uneven like it hadn’t seen sunlight in a long time. My eyes were rimmed with purple, puffy and half-lidded, like I hadn’t slept in years. And maybe I hadn’t, not really. The shadows under them weren’t just from last night. They were older. Familiar. The kind that feel like weights sinking in deep, down into the bone.

My cheeks looked hollow. My lips were chapped. There was a healing bruise just under the collar of my shirt—yellow and sickly, like an old secret I couldn’t scrub off.

I looked like someone who was trying too hard to look functional. Someone who could pass for normal if you didn’t stare too long. If you didn’t ask the wrong question.

Most people wouldn’t see it, though.

To them, I’d just be another tired barista behind the counter. One more blank face in a coffee shop uniform, young and forgettable. Maybe they'd see the dark circles and assume it was from a party, not panic. From fun, not fear. If they really looked hard they might see the chewed fingernails and tips but that could just be a bad habit. Not a comfort.

They’d never know what kind of tired I really was.

Not the kind sleep fixes.

I adjusted the strap of the apron, blinked hard, and stepped through the door.

The place smelled like burnt espresso and lemon cleaner. Not unpleasant, just... sterile. Lifeless. Corporate. It reminded me of a hospital pretending to be cozy and clean.

I learned how to fake a smile by 8:12 a.m.

By 8:24, I forgot what my own voice sounded like.

By 8:37, I had repeated “Next please” twenty-seven times. I counted. It gave me something to hold onto.

Customers came and went like a blur of coats, headphones, and half-mumbled orders. I nodded, poured, steamed, tapped buttons, wiped counters. Said ""Sorry about that"" when I didn’t mean it. Said ""Have a great day"" when I didn’t care. Laughed once at a joke I didn’t hear properly. They didn’t notice. No one ever does.

The hours slid past in oily, indistinct smears. I couldn’t remember what I’d eaten. If I’d eaten. One of the girls on shift—Dani, I think—asked if I was okay. Said I looked tired.

I lied. Said I was just adjusting to the early hours. She nodded like that made sense, like she wasn’t really listening either. Maybe no one is.



By the time my shift ended, my body ached like I’d run a marathon through sand. I peeled off the apron, tossed it in the basket behind the counter, and walked out with a “Bye” to anyone or the cafe itself.

Back in the hallway of my building, the silence hit me harder than the noise ever could. I stood outside my apartment door for a long moment, hand hovering near the knob.

I wasn’t scared, exactly.

But I wasn’t ready to go inside either.

Something about the apartment—it feels like it’s waiting for me. Like it’s been quiet too long.

Like it noticed I was gone.

 

**The Lobby**

I came home late again. The sky was the color of bruised concrete, and the streetlights flickered like they were struggling to stay awake. My shoes felt like they weighed five pounds each. Every step up the front steps of the complex dragged.

He was standing in the lobby when I walked in.

Leaning against the wall near the mailboxes, arms crossed, eyes tracking me before I even noticed him.

""Evening,"" he said, voice rough like gravel. ""Long day?""

I nodded. ""Yeah.”

He didn’t move. Just kept watching. He wore a green maintenance jumpsuit with a stitched-on patch that read Len, faded around the edges. His thinning hair was slicked back, and there was a permanent shine on his forehead like he was always just coming in from somewhere damp.

“Barista, right?” he asked, like he already knew.

I hesitated. “…Yeah.”

Len smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Dangerous hours for a girl to be walking alone. Especially ‘round here.”

I shifted my weight. “I can take care of myself.”

“Not sayin’ you can’t,” he said quickly, still smiling. “Just… people get hurt a lot in this city. You’d be surprised how many don’t make the papers.”

I tried to laugh it off, but it came out wrong—too flat, too hollow. He watched me press the elevator button.

""Still settling in okay?"" he asked.

I nodded. “Yeah, thanks.”

“Good. Just… if you ever hear anything strange in the walls, don’t worry too much. Old place. Pipes knock, wiring buzzes. Stuff moves.” He paused. “Doesn’t mean a thing.”

The elevator dinged.

I stepped inside and pressed the button for my floor.

Len didn’t move from the wall. “Keep your door locked,” he said as the doors closed. “Better safe than sorry.”

The last thing I saw was his smile. Still not reaching his eyes. Then I heard a wry laugh as the elevator trudged. Starting its slow climb to twenty-fourth floor.",2,1755005158.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1mo8o2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mo8o2x/showcase_best_water_boiler_zojirushi_for_fast/,Showcase best water boiler Zojirushi for fast brewing and warming,"The Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH Micom Water Boiler and Warmer has been my daily companion in the kitchen for several months, and it's been quite a journey testing this product. As someone who drinks more tea than water and needs a reliable gadget to keep up, this water boiler seemed like a match made in appliance heaven—or so I thought. The sleek and polished stainless gray exterior caught my eye right out of the box. It has the kind of clean, modern design that blends seamlessly into any kitchen. I was particularly impressed with its compact dimensions, sitting at just 11.25 inches long, 8.25 inches wide, and 13.5 inches high. This means it fits right on my counter and doesn’t look out of place or eat up too much space. 

**Key Benefits**  
No surprises here—the temperature control system is where this water boiler truly shines. It features four keep-warm temperature settings (160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F). Being someone who shifts from herbal teas to matcha lattes to regular coffee throughout the day, I was overjoyed by the precision. The actual water temperature displays constantly on the screen, so you don’t have to guess if it's reached the right warmth or not. Its Quick Temp function, which skips the boiling phase and heads straight to a keep-warm temperature, is a godsend on mornings when I’m wrestling with my kids and need hot water in a snap. 

[Check Zojirushi CD-WHC40XH price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b07cb98837/)

Moving onto its energy-saving mode, my inner eco-conscious side feels a little better each time I press the timer function. You can program it to delay heating for 6 to 10 hours. I often use this feature overnight, so there’s no unnecessary power consumption while I sleep. Plus, the sound indicator alerting you to low water levels or the boiling process's end means no nasty surprises halfway through your tea ritual. A little beep saves a lot of time.

**Performance and User Experience**  
Performance-wise, this device delivers on its promises. Its swivel base is an unexpected but appreciated touch. It makes serving easy without having to lift the entire unit, which weighs around 7.09 pounds. Detaching the lid is also hassle-free, but here's where the design starts to reveal minor cracks—or more accurately, drips. The spout occasionally splashes a bit when pouring water, which is mildly annoying. Though the interior stainless steel coating is rust-resistant and easy to clean, I wish it came with a better mechanism preventing limescale buildup. After two months of use, a bit of extra scrubbing was necessary to keep it pristine.

**Caveats**  
- The spout could pour more smoothly; occasional splashes occur.
- The energy-saving feature, while great, would benefit from more customization options.
- Price-wise, it sits on the higher end, though the durability and precision justify it somewhat.

**Competing Products**  
Stacking this against other water boilers like the Panasonic NC-HU401P or the Tiger PDU-A50U, Zojirushi sets itself apart with its Quick Temp feature. Panasonic products often lack this, forcing you to wait for a full boil. Meanwhile, Tiger models boast slightly larger capacities but lack that intuitive swivel base and precise display, two features I found indispensable. The Zojirushi is also BPA-free, which might not seem like a big deal until you consider how many cups of tea and coffee you're making daily. It's these little touches that make it hard for competitors to match in convenience, although those ready to sacrifice non-essentials for a lower cost might find the Tiger model attractive.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its durable build and convenience, it offers good financial value—though the price-to-quality ratio might feel steep to more casual users who don’t demand constant hot water. If you're someone like me who juggles multiple drinks and needs a reliable machine to cater to different temperatures without fail, then the investment starts to feel worthwhile. For weekend tea drinkers, on the other hand, there are simpler options out there.

1mo8nmn,https://i.redd.it/1w8b1cs4blif1,"Rodrigo ""Roa"" Dut3rti letter to Inday SWOH","My Dearest Inday Sara,

One of these days—after you've battled through the impeachment drama, the Senate whispers, the media circus—you’ll open this and think: “Eh ‘to ang tatay ko talaga.” I write from The Hague, where they say justice lives—but here, justice sips cheap coffee, acts serious, and forgets how to laugh.

Let me set the scene: March 11, 2025—I walk into a plane, and bam! They arrest me under ICC orders, call it “Operation Pursuit.” Suddenly, I’m flown halfway around the world, and they think that cuffs and a suit will shut me up. I laughed. “Give me durian, not these crackers!” I joked, but nobody laughed. Weaklings.

Still—news came: despite the orange jumpsuit, despite The Hague, I was re‑elected mayor of Davao by a landslide—eight times more votes than the closest rival, over 660,000 souls shouting “Duterte!” From a cell! That’s not power—that’s dynasty. ** **.

And you, my daughter—Vice President Sara—facing impeachment. They tried to drag you down, but the Supreme Court tossed it out July 25, saying it was unconstitutional and blocking any trial until 2026. You dodged it. You emerged stronger. ** **

Now, see how this works: while they try to destroy us, we just rebound. Baste steps in as acting mayor, Paolo holds Congress, and grandkids fill local posts. The Davao machine is humming. ** **.

So here it is—Tatay’s extended manifesto:


---

1. Never let them write your story.
If they want to impeach you—flip it. Make it “they’re removing a threat.” You already proved that. They can’t stop what’s rooted.

2. Don’t just lead—intimidate.
Politics is not a kindness contest. If they cross you, cross them back—with style. One-sided roasts, mixed with fear—that’s power.

3. Laugh last, roar early.
Swear at them in public, then wink on TV. Let them think they’re laughing with you. Then, when the court calls or the Senate glares—you’re already two steps ahead.

4. Dynasty isn’t a dirty word.
If they call us “oligarchs,” let’s own it. The more they hate, the more they expose they’re afraid. Build your allies; bloodline is a foundation, not an affront.

5. Sleep is tactical.
Rest when your mind says fight—it saves strength for the real battles. Remember: anger spends energy, sarcasm keeps ammo in reserve.

6. Make those ICC suits sweat with style.
They think they can humiliate Duterte with formality. Show them consequences have class—and claws.


---

Inday, I miss Davao: the chaos of jeepneys, the smell of durian hitting your nose at 2AM, people yelling “Duterte!” everywhere. Tell Baste he’s doing fine holding the fort behind bars. He’s mayor now—but don’t let him take the throne. You’re still the power behind the throne.

When you come here—if you ever do—bring durian. And let’s terrorize these judges with smell of home. Remind them this is Filipino flavor. This is Duterte.

You carry my name, yes—but more than that, you carry my instinct: fight, outwit, win. And maybe roast them so badly they’ll beg for mercy.

Your Papa Digong

I’m starting to firm up my plans for maternity leave and while both me and my partner get a pretty sweet deal from our employers (me - 6 months full pay, 3 months half, him - 6 months at 90%). We’re planning to overlap a little but eke it out as much as possible to avoid paying for childcare as long as we can.

I currently commute to the office in central London three days a week (£160 on Oyster PAYG) and buy lunch every day and coffee some days (£200). I suppose at least for the first couple of months spend on outings with friends (restaurants, pubs, etc) will stop, but beyond that I can’t see anything obvious in my spend categories that will disappear. I guess I’m a bit worried about bridging the three months where my salary will halve so I’m looking for what other new parents’ experiences have been.

1mo89ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrysbootcamp/comments/1mo89ed/boston_barrys_challenge_complete_my_recap/,Boston Barry’s Challenge COMPLETE - My Recap,"Boston Barry’s Challenge complete!!
I’ll recap my four days of Boston fitness, it was an awesome trip to Boston and the challenge was AMAZING! The staff got into it, and made it so so special.

My Thursday night redeye flight to Boston was from Denver, where I had just shy of a two hour layover. Landed at DEN at the end of terminal A, connecting flight was out of terminal B. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to create/attempt the DENVER AIRPORT CHALLENGE - the challenge is walking end to end of each terminal (A/B/C, touching the window at the very end of each side) then back to B to board my flight. No use of escalators or moving walkways allowed, including the escalators down to the train between terminals (the stairs are hidden, though can be found). This challenge was a lot harder than I thought! Took me 95minutes, and I had to RUN to finish. Terminal A and B both have wings at the end of the terminal, that I didn’t know about, added extra steps. Solid movement on a layover, 5.35miles! Apple Watch coded it as a “hard” effort. It wore me out - boarded my flight and went right to sleep. 

Land in Boston at 6am, check Barry’s app and see that the 7:20am class with Kelly has two spots. I quickly book a floor spot! I always like starting on the floor, or rather I like finishing on the tread.

Take silver line from Logan, get to Barry’s at 6:40am, and effectively do my full morning routine in the locker room. 

The guy working the desk, Darren, was very kind, shook my hand, helped me with the locker (the lock was slightly different than every other one I’ve seen at Barry’s / fitness studios). His passion for Barry’s and providing a good experience was immediately palpable.

Awesome class with Kelly. Programing was amazing. Hypothetically THREE SWITCHES (hypothetical because Kelly said that three switches may be against the rules). 11min / 7min / 2min. “Flat Tread Friday.” Lot of pushes, lot of fast jogs, not a lot of recovery. Final 2min hypothetical block was 15sec jog, 45sec sprint, 30sec recovery, 30sec HIT A SPRINT PR!!!!
She used names, demo’d well, got us close to fatigue on floor but not total drop sets and had sick music. You can tell she’s a pro - I really enjoyed this class. 

Gathered my suitcase and backpack, time to walk to Back Bay and see if my hotel can toss me a bone with a 9am early check in. Answer is no if you don’t ask. Got an iced americano on the walk - which made me remember my old college Dunkin’ order, which I now (lovingly) refer to as “melted ice cream.” Medium iced, extra cream extra sugar and six munchkins - I’ve changed…

Early check in was GRANTED. Shower, work, nap, work. I needed to move, as such I booked a 4:20pm Solidcore at the South End location. On the walk there I was getting in my nostalgic feels on Columbus Ave., especially when I saw Barcelona wine bar - that was THE date spot in college. I once went there and ordered squid ink pasta, to impress my date (I guess.) it came out and was black. Didn’t expect that and the waitress could tell- she comped it & got us a new dish. I think there were a few more dates - though fizzled over Christmas break. She’s married now

Solid solidcore class with Bobbie B. Bobbie dealt with a lot and handled everything like a pro.  One girl had a friend coming who was going to be 20min late & the girl seemed to think we could delay class... Made me realize how much instructors deal with that isn’t related to instructing, especially at places like solidcore where there isn’t always front desk staff. Issues with parking, the app glitching, water fountain not working - that all falls on the instructor. They’ve got a tough job. 

Back at hotel and check out the gym, and it has a peloton rower. I haven’t used the peloton rower, so had to hit a 10min Katie Wong row. I liked it! Though I’m partial to the concept2 rowerg. There was a man working out in full business attire in the gym. No judgement, I support it.

Eataly for dinner, must carbolod for the Boston Barry’s Challenge!

Saturday! I’m awake and ready at 5:30am. Had a breakfast credit at my hotel though breakfast doesn’t begin until 7am, who can wait until 7am? Ordered room service. Fruit & espresso. Took too long to arrive - though the fruit totally hit. Lot of dragonfruit, not normally I fruit I buy - loved it. 

With fruit consumed, backpack packed with extra shirts/shorts/socks/phone&watch charger it was time to begin the BOSTON BARRY’S CHALLENGE. The challenge is a class at each Boston studio (Chestnut Hill, Back Bay, Downtown), running to/from each studio.

I take the D line to Chestnut Hill and have a pleasant walk to the studio. Cool studio, tucked away a little within the shopping center. 
7am Chestnut Hill crew is strong, they’re getting after it. I walk in and there is a sign that’s says “GO (my name) STOP #1”. Oh goodness, I’ve been found out. Tons of excitement from front desk girls, they hype me up. Mat comes out and we shake hands. What a nice guy. He’s a runner and super motivated and kind. 
Class starts, I begin on floor, there’s a motivational note on my bench and a fellow Barry’s redditor next to me on the floor. She reached out earlier in the week and asked if she could join me for my Chesnut Hill stop. She was SO COOL! Totally normal, super fit, a great person. Chat a little & begin a long floor block. Just like my first weekend in college, I went too heavy (with my weight / long band choice, as opposed to going too heavy with drinking in college). Tread block was DIFFICULT. Mat coached us through it exceptionally well. He made me laugh, saying he will only program what he would want to do - “that’s why you’ll never see a burpee in my class.” The other side of that is that since he is a runner, the tread programing is tough. 
My friend from Reddit absolutely crushed the tread blocks, and hit ELEVEN on her last sprint. SO PROUD. Seeing people level up and push themselves is so motivating. I was able to hold 15mph for a bit, then dropped it down to 14.
Mat shouts out me/my challenge to the class, and hypes me up. Made me feel great. This was an awesome class and a great start. Folks in the locker room and lobby after wished me luck. Front desk girl offered me nerds gummy clusters . And now it’s time to run five miles to Back Bay!!

Was feeling better than expected on the run, especially once I hit mile three and found myself back in the old college stomping grounds - Mission Hill. I lived on the hill for a few years, threw parties on the hill, dealt with Boston Police breaking up those parties on the hill, and really hated walking UP the hill. Well with my newfound love of running inclines, I did a side quest and ran UP the hill and past my old college apartments. This was fun, motivating, and nostalgic. Ran the next two miles fast, past Northeastern and past the Pru, I was feeling good - Boston is awake, sun is out, we are at stop #2 - Barry’s Back Bay 9:20 class with Kate.

Back Bay studio is nice, very large lobby and really nice locker room. Front desk crew knew of me - asked about my first class and run from Chestnut Hill- they were excited. They explained the challenge to Kate who said I’m insane. Kelly (my instructor from the day before) was at the studio, heading out, I think she taught the earlier class - was great to see her again!

Get to my spot & there was a thoughtful note on my bench from the staff. “Marked Safe at Stop #2.” So kind of the staff to get into it! The class is totally full, and Kate works the room fantastic. She isn’t afraid to inject her personality into the class, which I loved. Doing chest exercises is “like a free boob job, well not free, I guess $36 or however much a class is.” She’s “Sour Patch Kate” because her tread programing is sour then sweet. Do a “Kate Wheel” off your bench to the left side. “Okay Cardio Cuties.”  Her talking on the mic really was fun and enjoyable. The programing was tough, and she really coached endurance on the tread - encouraging everyone to stay jogging, or moving above a walk, as much as possible. My tread neighbors were working hard, trying to minimize walking, love to see it. I would imagine Barry’s can be a first foray into running for many people - I remember when I signed up for cross country before seventh grade, I could run for maybe two minutes before needing to break (usually due to a side cramp). If only thirteen year old me could see me hit a Barry’s sprint. 
Kate played great music, including the John Summit Remix of SILENCE - which hits soooo hard. I saved that song on Spotify and have been listening to it so much. 
Two big class milestones in class - I think 350 and 500 classes completed. Lot of cheers. Then Kate shouts me out, and explains my challenge. Cheers from the class, very very sweet. I’m smiling.  My smile gets even bigger when the lady next to me on tread asks me the nicest question I’ve maybe ever been asked. “Are you a fitness instructor?” I tell her no, and she says “you should be it was motivating working out next to you.” WOW. SO SWEET. I tell her she’s filled my bucket and I’ll hang on to that compliment forever. Finish class, tell Kate she crushed it, talk to some people outside and then run towards downtown.

The Back Bay studio to Downtown studio is really only a mile apart, though I had extra time before the 11:40am downtown class, so I ran through seaport - such a beautiful view of Boston from the seaport. Ended up running three miles and ended the run at KANE’S DONUTS. It was time to fuel…

Yes, at 11am - just 30min before the next class, I ate a Kane’s Maple Bacon donut. It was absolutely delicious. I loved every bite. Had some iced coffee too, I was feeling tired. 

Get to Boston Downtown studio and my tiredness goes away when I’m greeted with a super excited front desk crew and a personalized sign that says “(my name) CRUSHES BOSTON!!!” Soooo kind!! It is time to finish the challenge! Get to my tread and there is an incredibly thoughtful card there. 
Olivia is the instructor and her music is amazing. Smaller class, everyone starts on the treadmill. 17minute tread block - BRUTAL. We run at incline, I think up to 8%. Also do 90second pushes. It was a wild tread block, and definitely not what my legs wanted. Floor block was fun, and not easy at all. Olivia had great demos - and called out the muscle groups we were working. Final tread block. I get on the tread, start walking, and when I hit 8mph to jog it’s like my legs yell at me “WHY??” Legs were cooked by this time, and wanted the end of class. The end of class always comes, and sure enough it did. I finished my third class of the morning. I COMPLETED THE BOSTON BARRY’S CHALLENGE!!!
Olivia gives me a big shoutout - cheers from the class - we have time to stretch, and stretch I needed!

Then the absolute best part of the day happened. I walk into the lobby and the Barry’s crew has absolutely outdone themselves, on the front desk they have my favorite shake, flowers, and a Barry’s merch bag with a shirt from each studio - all to celebrate my Boston Barry’s Challenge completion. This was so unexpected, and absolutely beyond kind. Tbh I got a little emotional, complete strangers went above and beyond to hype me up, provide encouragement, and celebrate my challenge. This wouldn’t happen at a commercial gym, or other group fitness place, it really is unique to Barry’s - and a testament to their awesome staff, instructors, and mission. 

I take photos to celebrate the end of the challenge, have a glorious shower, and leave Barry’s DTX - sore, tired, and sooo happy. I did it. What a day!!!

Time for a lobster roll (cold, with mayo), a beer, and to meet up with friends for many many MANY more beers, enjoyed outdoors in the seaport.

Saturday night saw an early bedtime, but not before a coldstone creamery peanut butter perfection with cake batter ice cream. Yum.

Apple move ring for Saturday was 2,930 & 40,012 steps for the day. 

Because of the bedtime on Saturday I’m up early on Sunday, and see a 6am solidcore class. Only five people, including me, in the class, three of which were first timers. Liza is the coach, and she crushed it, totally brought the energy. I love an early weekend class, getting after it while everyone else is asleep. Overheard the first timers (who all knew one another) saying “wow that was humbling - made me feel like I’ve never worked out before” in the lobby after the class. Been there!

A friend who lives in southie recommended B/SPOKE, she goes there and has guest passes. B/SPOKE has all sorts of classes in their big building. Spin, Yoga, Lift, and Strength. My friend and I did the 10am Strength class with Cam. I love trying out a new group fitness class, and love working out with a friend! It was a great class. Pretty similar to a LIFT class at Barry’s, in that you use dumbbells and bodyweight - though no bench, rather a workout mat. It was full body and I was sweating, especially after the four minute EMOM finisher. Awesome to see my friend and experience B/SPOKE.

Sunday evening saw a dear friend’s wedding (the true purpose of this Boston trip) complete with ample dancing (and drinking).

And Monday - go back home day - for some insane reason I thought I would wake up early and do a 5 or 6am Barry’s class, try to get the weekday early AM vibe. Did not happen. Slept in until 9am, amazing. I took Maddy’s 11AM Back Bay Barry’s class - walking to the studio at 10:40am, as most of the world is working, almost felt like I was playing hooky (I wasn’t.. I put in PTO for the day). A cool feeling. 11am class was small but mighty. Overheard a funny conversation in the lobby before class, between a first timer and the friend who brought her. The friend was describing the class and said “it’s like OrangeTheory, except a lot cooler in every way.” Perfectly said ;) Maddy had us do weighted sit ups with mediums. SO TOUGH. Knowing I would be sitting on a plane in a few hours made me work harder in class.  Back to the hotel to pack up and check out.

Three hours before my flight meant I could squeeze in one final class. Booked 2pm solidcore at the Fenway location. Fenway solidcore is a vibe, two studios within the one location!! And directly next door to an OrangeTheory. In this two block area in Fenway there’s SC, OT, Corepower, and Handle Bar spin studio. Opportunity for the “Fenway Fitness Challenge??” Class at every different studio in the neighborhood, finish with a Red Sox game. Maybe next time…
Solidcore was SO GOOD, this 2pm Studio 1 class had a total of TWO PEOPLE, me and one other person. That’s AMAZING - it’s a semi-private! Gisella was the instructor and very cool. She addressed the class (all two of us) and said “I know it’s a smaller class -  I hope people are outdoors, enjoying the beautiful weather, moving their bodies.” And let us know that we should still take breaks and be ourselves, despite the small class size. It was a nice preface. Gisella provided many incredibly helpful corrections, got me to muscle failure on every section. It was a ton of center core - at least twenty minutes. And not just at the beginning of class, we had the normal center core block at the beginning and then she tossed in more throughout. Best of all, Gisella talked a lot about longevity. What a great message to coach, and one that really resonated with me. People go to group fitness for all sorts of reasons. Speaking for myself I started Barry’s to help aid in weight-loss, as I wanted a better looking body. Of course group fitness / Barry’s helps accomplish those goals, though it also does so much more - it allows you to live a longer life. It allows you to push yourself, and level up. It puts you in a room with people who are all working to better themselves.

I loved the Boston Barry’s Challenge - it felt great to challenge myself and do a hard thing. It felt even better having the outpouring of support from each studio. Tremendous shoutout to the Barry’s Boston staff - they absolutely crush it.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you’re the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn’t just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro — we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

It looks great in the living room, fits well with **mid century modern furniture**, and adds a classy touch to your overall **home decoration**. But many people wonder how to clean it without ruining the material.

If you follow the right steps and use gentle products, your **leather** or **vegan leather sofa** can stay clean and soft for a long time. This guide will help you take care of your sofa easily, whether it's in your **bedroom** or living space.

# Step 1: Know What Type of Leather You Have

Before you clean, find out what kind of leather your sofa is made of. Not all leather is the same. Each type needs different care.

* **Full-grain or top-grain leather** is strong and long-lasting. 
* **Semi-aniline leather** feels softer and looks more natural. But it can stain more easily.  
* **Vegan leather** is made without animals. It is easier to clean, but harsh products can damage the surface. 

# Step 2: Gather Safe Cleaning Tools

You don’t need fancy tools to clean a **leather sofa**. Just keep it simple:

* **Soft microfiber cloths** – These don’t scratch or leave lint.  
* **Vacuum with a brush tool** – Helps clean corners and between cushions.  
* **Distilled water** – Safer than tap water because it has no minerals that can stain.  
* **Mild soap** or **leather cleaner** – Gentle on the material.  
* **Leather conditioner** – Helps keep the leather soft and smooth.  

# Step 3: Dust and Vacuum Weekly

Dust might seem harmless, but over time it can wear down your leather. Once a week:

* Wipe the whole sofa with a dry microfiber cloth.  
* Use the vacuum to clean seams, cracks, and under cushions.  

# Step 4: Clean with Damp Cloth

For deeper cleaning:

1. Mix mild soap with **distilled water**.  
2. Dip the microfiber cloth into the soapy water. Wring it out so it’s only slightly damp.  
3. Wipe the leather in small circles. Don’t soak the leather.  
4. Use another cloth with plain distilled water to rinse the soap off.  
5. Dry the sofa with a clean towel. Don’t let it stay wet.  

# Step 5: Remove Stains the Right Way

If you spill something, act fast.

* **Blot, don’t rub.** Use a dry cloth to gently press on the spill.  
* For coffee or wine, use mild soap or a vinegar and water mix (50/50). Blot again and dry.  
* For greasy stains, put a bit of baking soda or cornstarch on it. Let it sit overnight. Then vacuum it off.  
* For ink, dab gently with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Test first on a hidden spot.  
* For sticky stuff like gum, freeze it with an ice cube. When it hardens, gently pull it off.  

These tricks are safe for **vegan leather sofas** which is designed for easy everyday use.

# Step 6: Deep Clean and Condition Every Few Months

Every 3 to 6 months:

* Clean the entire surface with a leather-safe cleaner.  
* After it’s dry, apply **leather conditioner** or a mix of coconut oil and mild soap.  
* Let the conditioner soak in for a bit, then wipe off the extra.  

This step helps the leather stay soft and flexible. It also brings back that smooth, shiny look that makes your **home decoration** feel new again.

# Step 7: Protect Your Sofa

Little things make a big difference over time:

* Rotate your cushions often so one spot doesn’t wear out faster.  
* Keep your **leather sofa** out of direct sunlight. Too much heat causes fading and cracks.  
* Use soft pads under sofa legs to protect the floor and prevent slipping.  
* Add throws or blankets if you have pets or kids who sit on the sofa often.  
* Keep your room at a good temperature (around 60–77°F) with balanced humidity (40–60%).  

These habits are great for keeping both your **leather sectional sofa** and **bedroom leather accents** looking brand new.

# Easy Care Schedule

||
||
|**Task**|**How Often**|
|Dust and vacuum|Once a week|
|Spot clean spills|As soon as they happen|
|Deep clean + condition|Every 3–6 months|
|Rotate cushions|Every few months|
|Protect from sunlight|Always|



# Decor Tips with Leather Sofas

A **leather sofa** is more than just a place to sit. It’s a design choice. Here are some **home decor ideas** to match it with your space:

* Pair a leather piece with a colorful area rug and wood coffee table for a **mid century modern** look.  
* Add soft pillows and throws to warm up the look.  
* In your **bedroom**, a small leather bench or chair can add style and function.  
* Use light colors and natural textures to balance the deep tones of leather.  



You don’t need to be an expert to take care of your **leather sofa**. With simple steps and a little attention, your furniture can stay clean, soft, and beautiful. Whether you’ve chosen a **vegan leather sectional** or a genuine **leather couch**, regular care helps your sofa last longer and look better.

I’d make adjustments, then get a preview printed, then adjust again.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you’re the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn’t just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro — we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Making a decent income… but somehow always broke. Always stressed.

Then I realized something wild: I wasn’t poor — I was bleeding money in dozens of tiny places I couldn’t see.

In just 30 days, here’s what I uncovered:

* **$127/mo** in forgotten subscriptions I never used
* **$284/mo** in grocery overspending (without eating less)
* **$198/mo** in “invisible” transportation costs
* **$156/mo** in utility waste I fixed in 15 minutes
* **$82/mo** in entertainment I barely noticed

Total rescued: **$847/month = $10,164/year**

The crazy part?  
No budgeting apps, no giving up lattes, no moving back with parents. Just a simple, systematic check for “money leaks.”

I turned the process into a **day-by-day system** that takes 10–15 minutes daily. By Day 7, most people find $200–$400/month they didn’t know they had.

If you want the exact breakdown I used, **DM me and I’ll send it over** (it’s a full step-by-step).

Like, actually showing up even virtually.

1mo874m,https://i.redd.it/dhqyw6fo7lif1.jpeg,"I like the muddier bed more, and question about grind particle distribution","Set-up and grinder: I brewed these two V60s side-by-side with different grind settings on my Fellow Ode Gen 2 with SSP MP burrs (5 clicks off chirp) that I just aligned a couple days ago. The one on the left was at grind size 6 and the one on the right was at grind size 9. 

Water: 0 TDS water re-mineralized with Lotus Coffee Drops using their Bright and Juicy recipe (about 80 ppm hardness and 20 ppm alkalinity).

Coffee: Light roasted washed Pink Bourbon Colombian (German Peña, Copa de Oro, roasted by September). About 1 month off roast.

Recipe: I used Brian Quan’s light roast V60 recipe. Cafec T-90 (Medium-Dark, fast-flowing) filters, 1:17 ratio, 3x bloom for 1 minute with wet WDT, then I split the rest into two pours, wet WDTing after the first and swirling and tapping after the 2nd.

Drawdown: The left (grind size 6) is muddier than the right (size 9), but interestingly, they finished brewing at almost the same exact time (3:12 vs 3:08).

Taste: they both tasted great, and I could taste the blackberry and juicy citrus notes. The only difference was that the finer grind with the muddier bed had a more pronounced and punchy acidity with a longer aftertaste, which I enjoyed more than the other.

Next test: Tomorrow I will compare grind size 4 with grind size 6.

Question: with my grinder set up (details above), should the beds be this muddy? Or does this look like I am getting too many fines at these settings?",8,1755003914.0,pourover,13,0.9,False

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Making a decent income… but somehow always broke. Always stressed.

Then I realized something wild: I wasn’t poor — I was bleeding money in dozens of tiny places I couldn’t see.

In just 30 days, here’s what I uncovered:

* **$127/mo** in forgotten subscriptions I never used
* **$284/mo** in grocery overspending (without eating less)
* **$198/mo** in “invisible” transportation costs
* **$156/mo** in utility waste I fixed in 15 minutes
* **$82/mo** in entertainment I barely noticed

Total rescued: **$847/month = $10,164/year**

The crazy part?  
No budgeting apps, no giving up lattes, no moving back with parents. Just a simple, systematic check for “money leaks.”

I turned the process into a **day-by-day system** that takes 10–15 minutes daily. By Day 7, most people find $200–$400/month they didn’t know they had.

If you want the exact breakdown I used, **DM me and I’ll send it over** (it’s a full step-by-step).

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay.

1mo83z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/1mo83z9/ltheanineglutamate_regulationpreventing_spikes/,"L-Theanine/Glutamate Regulation/Preventing spikes, mania, and psychosis/altered states","TL/DR:  L-theanine is WORKING!!! Yasssss!!! 200mg a day plus whatever is in my green tea seems to be preventing glutamate spike. So no hypomanic symptoms that usually precursor my altered states/psychosis. 

_____

The context:

I have spend a few weeks researching and experimenting with this. Already did a post on using taurine for stopping glutamate spikes/excitotoxicity in emergencies. (Link below) 

The issue with taurine is that it works like an emergency break and isn’t advised to be taken daily (possible links to leukemia, as well as suppressing glutamate too much.. very sedative supplement) but it is incredible if you are already in a spike/experiencing mania/psychosis. 

L-theanine (described to me as the “power steering” whereas taurine is more of an “emergency break”) is the precursor to GABA which is the “yin” to the glutamate’s “yang”. The issue with GABA supplements is that it struggles to cross the blood brain barrier so using L-theanine is a way to work around this. 

I have been using a supplement form of L-Theanine (Pure Encapsulations) for a few weeks. 200mg a day seems to be doing the trick. Also drinking green tea more than coffee for caffeine boosts. Green tea also has a decent amount of L-theanine in it which helps with the jitters aspect. 

I have noticed a definite improvement of being able to handle stressors without flying into altered states. Including missing sleep which used to throw me for a loop. I have a disabled child so consistent sleep routines are challenging for me. I do my best on that front. 

Since starting the L-theanine I have not experienced any hypomania or that anxious/plugged in feeling that the glutamate spikes usually cause which warns me of the excitotoxicity happening. So this I call a win. 

Here is the link to the Taurine post on how to explore that safely. 

(Glutamate Spike Checklist, and how I use taurine to stop mania/psychosis caused by excitotoxicity)

Super nerdy stuff:

Here is all the nerdy stuff about GABA and Glutamate and how L-theanine plays a roll in this. 

Hope this helps others battling issues like mine because doctors dont know crap about this and it is incredibly infuriating. 

About L-theanine:

1. Boosts Gaba

Structurally similar to glutamate, L-theanine can cross the blood–brain barrier and bind to certain glutamate receptors, but instead of stimulating them, it nudges your system toward producing more GABA.

This happens partly by supporting glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) (the enzyme that converts glutamate into GABA) and partly by influencing alpha brain wave activity (associated with calm alertness).

Result: Increased GABA tone → less overfiring, more calm focus.

2. Modulates Glutamate

L-theanine acts as a gentle glutamate receptor antagonist, especially at NMDA and AMPA receptors.

This means it blocks some of glutamate’s excitatory signals without shutting them down entirely, like a dimmer switch instead of an off switch.

By doing this, it prevents “excitotoxicity” (neurons overstimulating themselves) and reduces the risk of anxiety, racing thoughts, and sensory overload. This also prevents cell/nerve damage. 

3. Basic overview

You still have enough glutamate to think, learn, and stay engaged.

Excess glutamate gets converted to GABA instead of just buzzing around overstimulating neurons.

Alpha brain wave activity increases, so your nervous system is in that sweet spot of calm alertness, not sleepy, not jittery.

Then again, I am from India and you know, Creative Writing is as much promoted as chewing gums under the desk here. But, that doesn't mean I am not good enough. I have written aplenty stories, and this one is not my best yet but it's the most recent and it's copied in my clipboard soooo to save time and because I am lazy, I will post this first. And, I usually write one shots cuz school and life never leave me free. Though, after I make some mark here I might consider writing a novel for NaNoWriMo.

Feedback is appreciated.)

How did we even end up like this!? NO FAIR! Just look at her...turned away from me and sniffing like a child...Ugh...I want to cuddle her so bad... I sigh and look up at the ceiling. Fairy lights...I set them up...just like I did when we were kids. I smile softly.

It started with the teacher. She paired me up with her. For? A TOPIC THAT WASN'T EVEN IN OUR SYLLABUS! I swear she did it on purpose. That's no fair. It's like forcing two like poles to join, Impossible! And Absurd!! I remember. I sat next to her and stared into her eyes for a moment. They were still purple. Just like 10 years ago. Still so...beautiful...Cue nostalgic sigh. I stop staring and look away. She 'hmphed' as well and looked away. Typical girlie....just like the one I remember.

I turn to face her back and smile softly. Purple nightdress. I had given her that on her 13th birthday. She had smiled and kissed my cheek that day. I rub my cheek on that spot softly. I close my eyes.

Meanwhile, Scarlet was in a trance herself. She was clutching the bracelet tightly to her chest, sniffing. She remembered how far he used to go for her. So stubborn...she smiled softly. She had just fantasized about having a bracelet on a sleepover one night, and he went to the store, argued with an employee, all just for her. So stubborn...she chuckled softly.

For the group project, we had to go to each other's houses. But before that...we had to talk. About the project. The next day during lunch we sat awkwardly. My legs were shaking. The air was so...weird. It made me shiver and yet made me sweat...I felt feverish as hell...ugh...I could have fainted any time then. I noticed her blue earring. It suited her. I said, 'Blue earrings...' She had jumped slightly by the surprise. I got startled as well. We remained quiet for a long time. 'Thanks', she had whispered...What she thanked me for, why she thought that a compliment was worth thanking was out of my mind...just like her ideas back then...

I sigh again as I smile. I hear the rustling of the bedsheets, but ignore it.

Meanwhile, Scarlet had turned to look at me. Perhaps, I was asleep and she could...hug me?

Our parents forced us to meet. 'After all, you were best chumps!' mum said. Ugh...so cringe...We had met at the local café, there were couples around. Holding hands. Smell of coffee. She used to make coffee so much for us before... We had sat across the table. She was still wearing blue earrings... My eyes prickle with a soft tear as it flows down.

We used to play in the park when we were 4...She used to always ask for a piggyback ride. I loved it. Her hands used to feel so soft around my neck. Those very hands brushed against mine that day at the café...What was a popular girl doing anyways with a nerd like me?...Didn't she have better friends...? The ones she used to chat with since our argument?... We had talked. Stiffly, that day. Baguettes...they looked so good on her lips....everything looked good on her lips... Will my lips also look good with her?...

Suddenly, my eyes fly open as I feel her hand touch my cheek. She was right in front of me. Staring at my face. I stare into her eyes. The tear that had just rolled down was now on her palm...Her body was just inches away from mine.

Her breath was...warmer than any fireplace...

Purple eyes...

Blue earrings...

Fairy lights...

I hesitantly take my shivering hand onto her cheek...She gasps softly...her voice is such a melody... ‘What are you doing...Nick?...’ She whispers softly. I smile...softly...almost invisible.

I lean in... 'I missed this...Scarlet...' She continued staring at me, like a statue. A very cute statue. A statue which made me crazy for 6 years.

‘I missed...you...’ She hesitantly said, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. Why did she have to be so cute when so...vulnerable?...It made me want to kiss her so bad... I wrap my arms around her waist and shudder. Why was I shuddering when I was supposed to be the brave and bold one here? Ugh...Love’s so unpredictable... Was she this slim before?...

It didn't matter... she was smiling...all that mattered was...I thought as I pulled her closer and rested my chin on her head...we were home...again.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Making a decent income… but somehow always broke. Always stressed.

Then I realized something wild: I wasn’t poor — I was bleeding money in dozens of tiny places I couldn’t see.

In just 30 days, here’s what I uncovered:

* **$127/mo** in forgotten subscriptions I never used
* **$284/mo** in grocery overspending (without eating less)
* **$198/mo** in “invisible” transportation costs
* **$156/mo** in utility waste I fixed in 15 minutes
* **$82/mo** in entertainment I barely noticed

Total rescued: **$847/month = $10,164/year**

The crazy part?  
No budgeting apps, no giving up lattes, no moving back with parents. Just a simple, systematic check for “money leaks.”

I turned the process into a **day-by-day system** that takes 10–15 minutes daily. By Day 7, most people find $200–$400/month they didn’t know they had.

If you want the exact breakdown I used, **DM me and I’ll send it over** (it’s a full step-by-step).

Guess who he blamed. My boyfriend but thing is my boyfriend had brought his own Xbox controller so for two days he hadn't used the ones we had, and when I got it it was already like that, and since then my brother has hated my boyfriend and my boyfriend hates my brother, I understand why my bf hates my brother due ti the accusations my brother threw at my bf, but he seems to piss a lot of people at my school off too, my bf twin brother who is A on here because I won't name drop and it'll be the same for others, my bfs younger sister H, my bfs mum AL, my bfs friend L, my friend B. Today I also found out my brother hates when my bf comes over because 'my bf leaves the house in a mess' for context, my bf and I used to hang in the living room but my bf would help out like bring wood in and always keep mine and his space clean, now my mum allowed us in my room, so either way the house has never been a mess because of my boyfriend and my brother rarely does chores unless it benefits him, while i get paid for feeding the dog day and night and the cats, while he only has to bring in wood and do dishes, btw I do have to bring in wood and do the dishes too, so with feeding the cats and dog, doing the dishes, and wood that 4 things I have to do along with making my parents coffee's sometimes folding clothes, going shopping with my dad for food, and getting dinner, yet my brother gets to relax and even tho I do so much around the house. I still have to try keep my room clean which is hard due to my low mental health, and how high my stress level is, so with the fact my brother only do 2 chores and can keep his room clean while I have so much to do, i hate it a lot but I do it mainly for my mum since she's done so much for me but my brother takes her for granted a lot and i wish he wouldn't, I'm so close to snapping at him for how he treated my bf and others.

Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.

Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.

I never knew christian culture, so obviously i had a fun time being an outsider getting to experience all the camps, songs(imagine my suprise when only seeing churches on TV and then finding out they play electric guitar, drums and have a coffee shop in the lobby).

So as a baby christian i loved going around and experiencing the different ways of worshipping Christ, we have a beautiful catholic church in my small city thats really the only place open all day for prayer, so i spent a lot of time there and in daily masses. On sundays i would go to a pentecostal church and join communities/get friends and join small groups. I didnt know what a denomination even was in the beginning, i just prayed, loved Christ and started living the way He wants us to live.

However, every time i told the people from either church that i was either spending time in Catholic churches or vice versa, they get super weird about it. The protestants just seemed weirded out, the catholics immediately condemned it. Which i genuinely finds stupid. Catholics practice salvation through faith+good works. Which i do. Which a LOT of believers do. I take the eucharist, but i also love the sermons and communities in my pentecostal church. I volunteer in both churces. Nothing i am doing is against anything biblical from either denomination , yet it is so frowned upon by both sides. Of course, the theology is very different, but i just find it so inspiring to see both sides of both dicipline/submission and salvation/love.

So if anyone here actually can answer as to why people find this to be so problematic, please answer as most don't dare IRL. I want to worship GOD and GOD alone, not be a part of this cultural christianity that places things in boxes",1,1755003405.0,Christianity,2,0.67,False

1mo7zax,https://i.redd.it/nb8uryur5lif1.jpeg,How to Clean a Leather Sofa Without Damaging It,"# How to Clean a Leather Sofa Without Damaging It

**Easy tips for keeping your leather sofa clean, soft, and beautiful**

A **leather sofa** can make any room feel stylish and warm. If you love the look of **mid century modern furniture**, a leather couch or **sectional sofa** from **Mid in Mod** is a great choice. But to keep it looking nice for years, you need to take care of it the right way.

This guide gives you simple steps to clean your leather sofa without ruining it. You’ll also learn how to protect it, keep it soft, and make it last longer — all while keeping your **home decoration** fresh and cozy.





# 1. First, Know What Kind of Leather You Have

Not all leather is the same. Some types are strong and easy to clean. Others need a little more care.

* **Top-grain leather** is very strong and smooth. Mid in Mod uses this kind of leather on the **Brooklyn Tan Leather Sofa**. It looks great and is built to last.  
* **Aniline or semi-aniline leather** is softer but can stain more easily.  
* **Faux leather (vegan leather)** is simple to clean but may crack if you use strong cleaners. Mid in Mod's **Floyd Cognac Vegan Leather Sofa** and **Delano Cognac Sectional Sofa** are both great, low-maintenance options.  

Check the product details or care tag to learn what kind of leather your sofa has. Mid in Mod always shares this on their website.





# 2. Gather the Right Tools

You don’t need anything fancy. Just a few gentle tools:

* A **microfiber cloth** (soft and won’t scratch)  
* A **vacuum with a brush head** (to clean corners and seams)  
* **Distilled water** (it’s cleaner than tap water)  
* **Mild soap** or **leather cleaner**  
* **Leather conditioner** or natural oil (like olive or coconut oil)  





# 3. Dust and Vacuum Every Week

Cleaning your sofa once a week helps it stay fresh and smooth.

* Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe away dust.  
* Vacuum the cracks and seams to get rid of crumbs or dirt.  

This stops dust from building up and scratching the leather.





# 4. Wipe It Down Gently

After dusting, it’s time to wipe.

* Mix a little mild soap with distilled water.  
* Dip your cloth in, then wring it out — it should just be damp.  
* Wipe the sofa in small, gentle circles.  
* Rinse your cloth often and go over the sofa again with just water.  
* Dry with a clean cloth. Don’t let water soak into the leather.  

This step keeps the leather clean without causing damage.

# 5. Handle Spills and Stains Carefully

If something spills, don’t wait — act fast.

* **Blot the spot** with a soft cloth. Don’t rub — rubbing can make the stain worse.  
* For **coffee or juice**, use mild soap or a vinegar-water mix (half and half).  
* For **greasy stains**, sprinkle baking soda or cornstarch. Leave it for a few hours, then vacuum it up.  
* For **ink stains**, use a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol — but test in a hidden spot first.  
* For **gum or wax**, place an ice cube on the spot. Once it’s hard, gently lift it off.  

# 6. Deep Clean Every Few Months

Your leather sofa needs a little extra love every 3 to 6 months.

* Clean it like before, using leather-safe cleaner and distilled water.  
* After it’s dry, use a soft cloth to apply leather conditioner or oil.  
* Let it sit, then wipe off the extra.  

This helps keep the leather soft, shiny, and strong.



# 7. Take Small Steps to Protect Your Sofa

Little habits make a big difference.

* **Rotate the cushions** every so often, especially if it’s a **sectional sofa** like the Delano.  
* **Keep pets** off the arms or back cushions — they can squash the shape.  
* **Use pads under the legs** to protect your floors.  
* **Avoid direct sunlight** — it can dry and fade the leather.  
* Try to keep the room temperature between **60–77°F**, with humidity around 40–60%. This keeps the leather from drying out or getting moldy.  





# 8. Easy Care for Mid in Mod Sofas

Mid in Mod sofas are made with both style and care in mind. Here are a few great options:

* **Brooklyn Tan Leather Sofa**: Made with Italian top-grain leather. It looks elegant and only needs a quick wipe and conditioning a few times a year.  
* **Floyd Cognac Vegan Leather Sofa**: A great choice for busy homes. It’s easy to clean and looks sleek in any room.  
* **Delano Cognac Vegan Leather Sectional**: Perfect for families or shared living spaces. It offers plenty of room and is very low-maintenance.  

These sofas don’t just make your living room look amazing — they also fit right into your **home decor ideas**.



# 9. Simple Cleaning Schedule

||
||
|**How Often**|**What to Do**|
|Weekly|Dust with a soft cloth; vacuum the seams|
|After Spills|Blot stains right away; use gentle cleaning if needed|
|Every 3–6 months|Full clean with leather cleaner + apply conditioner|
|Every 6–12 months|Use leather conditioner to keep leather soft and shiny|
|Ongoing|Rotate cushions; avoid heat/sun; use throw blankets for style|



# 10. Use Leather Sofas in Your Home Decoration

Leather sofas don’t just belong in the living room. You can use them all around the home:

* In your **bedroom**, try a leather bench or accent chair.  
* Pair your sofa with **soft rugs**, **cozy throws**, or **colorful pillows**.  
* Match your leather pieces with other **mid century modern furniture** like wood coffee tables or low-profile chairs for a complete look.  



Keeping your leather sofa clean is easy when you know what to do. With gentle cleaning, quick action on spills, and regular conditioning, your leather furniture will stay soft, beautiful, and part of your home for many years.

If you love the timeless look of **mid century modern furniture**, Mid in Mod has beautiful leather sofas like the **Delano**, **Floyd**, and **Brooklyn Tan** — all built for both style and everyday life.

Take care of your leather, and it’ll take care of your space. ❤️

I don’t usually post here, but I needed to let this out. Maybe someone’s been through this, maybe not. Either way, I’m writing this because it’s becoming heavier.

**1. Focus in Salah**

When I was younger before college I used to hear people say, *“You’re not focused in salah, you’re thinking about your work.”* I used to quietly scoff at that. *“That won’t be me,”* I told myself. *“I’m not that busy. I’ll never let work distract me in front of Allah.”*

But here I am, in my final year of engineering and Alhamdulillah, by Allah’s mercy, I’ve started my own company. It’s something I prayed for, worked for, and now it’s happening.

But in every prayer… my thoughts drift. Tasks, to-dos, bugs, features, deadlines. Even when I’m reciting the Surahs I’ve known for years, I don’t feel *present*. I say *A’udhu billahi min ash-shaytaan ir-rajeem*. I even do the little “thu thu” to spit away the distraction. But I still lose myself.

It scares me. Am I really this weak in khushoo’? Or am I just making excuses blaming my attention span, my work, this phase of life because I don’t want to admit that my heart is disconnected?

**2. I Am So Lonely**

This part’s harder to write.

I’ve never had a girlfriend. I don’t want one. I’ve waited and am still waiting for my future wife, Inshallah.

I don’t open up to people. I have five friends. Good ones. But we don’t share emotions. They see me as “that guy” the one who always knows what to say, who can fix anything, the strong one. I give advice. I give clarity. One of them hugged me after I helped him through something and I felt… awkward. I don’t even like hugs. Except from my dad on Eid. That’s the only one that feels okay.

I grew up in a home where my parents are emotionally expressive. But me? I don’t know what happened. Somewhere along the way, I closed off. I don’t express emotions, it’s become so default for me.

But here’s the truth:

**I am so lonely.**

Not physically I have people around, people who love me and care for me. But emotionally… it’s like I’m surrounded by a wall I built and forgot how to tear down.

I crave love. Softness. Connection. A voice that says, “I love you so much, come cuddle with me.”

And when that craving overwhelms me, I turn to music. Not satanic trash from the West. Just simple, emotional Indian love songs, especially the ones where women sing about their love for a man.

It makes me imagine… *someone*, somewhere, singing it for me. Even though I know she doesn’t exist, not yet. It’s a fantasy. But it’s all I have. My guilty pleasure.

I used to listen to Quran in the car. I used to do zikr on my walks. I don’t even drink coffee or tea never have because I believe they slow the brain in the long run.

But now? I’m slipping. I’m listening to songs. Not because I love music. But because I hate this emptiness. Constant loneliness for just *being me*. It’s exhausting. I don’t even get tears or cry it’s just emptiness. Pure. Wanting someone personal. Someone to be with.

Because I want to be loved.

(My friends and family do love me I know that. But I mean *from that one person*.)

And then I look at the people around me the options, the culture and I fear…

*What if the one I’m waiting for doesn’t exist?*

What if all I get are people who don’t match my values? Who don’t feel like home? Who are different than me in a haram way?

Also, I also sometimes wonder... maybe it’s not just a personal weakness. Maybe it’s how Allah designed us. In Islam, we’re allowed to marry as soon as we hit puberty, it’s not discouraged or delayed the way society treats it today.

And now that I’ve started working, taking on responsibilities, building something real the only thing that feels missing is *her*. A wife, A partner. Someone to come home to, someone to pray with, to open up to, to love and be loved by.

Maybe this loneliness isn't just in my head. Maybe it’s *biological*, *emotional*, *spiritual* all rolled into one. Aren’t we, as humans, meant to have someone by our side?

So I ask you:

Is this a struggle I’m meant to endure with sabr?

Or am I just dressing up my weaknesses as noble fights?

Inshort:

1. I used to think I’d never lose focus in Salah. But now, work thoughts constantly distract me during prayer. Is this just my phase in life, or a deeper disconnect from Allah?
2. I’ve never had emotional intimacy or vulnerability with anyone. I crave love so deeply that I’ve started listening to love songs imagining someone’s voice telling me I’m loved. I know it’s wrong, but I’m so lonely… and I don’t know what else to do.",1,1755003265.0,MuslimLounge,0,1.0,False

Here where I got confused, i always thought he asked me out bcs he likes me (logically it would be that right bcs why would he invite me to stuff whennwe are not even friends in the first place). But whenever I told him that “my friends” thought we are a couple, he always seems to avoid it and be like “omg no stop it”. But the thing is he likes posting me on his social medias? I dont understand? He also likes texting me randomly but acts like he doesnt like me?

So please, redditors tell me, should I stay ? Or should I just leave him bcs I am afraid of a heartbreak.

1mo7xar,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mo7xar/can_the_breville_bambino_plus_espresso_machine/,Can the Breville Bambino Plus Espresso Machine Transform Coffee at Home?,"Testing out the Breville Bambino Plus BES500DBL1BUS1 has been an adventure in coffee-making, and let me say, it has certainly added more pep to my mornings. As someone who thrives on caffeine and loves the ritual of a well-crafted espresso, this machine quickly became a companion in my kitchen. Sporting a sleek Damson Blue design, it performs like a professional espresso machine but fits perfectly into a home setting without being bulky or overwhelming. My first impression was how compact yet stylish it is—ideal for those who value counter space as much as they cherish their morning coffee. 

**Key Benefits**  
Admittedly, I found myself appreciating some standout features:  
- Its ThermoJet heating system, which gets the machine up to the optimal extraction temperature in just three seconds, saved me time every single day.  
- The automatic milk frother is a feature I didn’t realize I needed until I was twirling latte art for the first time in my life—it makes beginners feel like pros.  
- I loved the low-pressure pre-infusion feature that ensures a balanced and flavorful cup each time. Every espresso shot came out lush and just the way I wanted it.  

[Check Breville BES500DBL1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bdmtkf5b/)

**Compact Yet Functional Design**  
The moment I unboxed this espresso machine, I was impressed by its size. At only 7.5 inches wide, it managed to squeeze itself perfectly between my blender and toaster without being intrusive. The modern styling, combined with thoughtful ergonomics, ensured it looked good while being user-friendly. Operating it is straightforward—just press the buttons for one or two cups, steam, or configure milk temperature and texture to your preference. I didn’t have to fumble with any complicated tech.

**Performance Excellence**  
Over the course of numerous test runs, I noticed how consistent this machine is. Using a 54mm porta-filter with 19 grams of coffee ensures a rich and balanced espresso every time. I experimented with different coffee beans, from store-bought to specialty roasts, and the results were consistently satisfying. Moreover, its digital temperature control (PID) ensures precise heat levels during brewing, so there’s no compromise on taste.

**The Milk Frothing Magic**  
The automatic steam wand deserves a special mention. Adjusting milk foam texture and temperature was transformative for my cappuccino and latte preparation. Whether I wanted dense foam for a macchiato or velvety microfoam for latte art (yes, milk hearts!), it handled it all with grace. I even let my cousin, who’s practically a novice, try it and they managed a fairly decent foam on their very first attempt.

**Areas for Concern**  
While overall impressive, there are a few things I think could be improved:  
- The steaming wand seemed louder than expected, which felt unnecessary for how smooth the rest of the machine operates.  
- Although the included cleaning tools are helpful, maintaining the steam wand can be tedious due to milk residue building up rather quickly.  
- It took me a while to get the settings exactly right for my taste preferences. A more detailed user manual would’ve been helpful.  

**Challengers in the Market**  
In comparison to competitors like the De’Longhi Dedica and the Gaggia Classic Pro, the Breville Bambino Plus offers a unique balance of cutting-edge technology and user-friendly operation. The Dedica is slightly more affordable yet lacks advanced features like the automatic milk frother. The Gaggia Classic Pro might cater to purists who love manual processes, but it feels bulkier and outdated in contrast. For modern kitchens, the Bambino Plus easily wins in aesthetics and compactness while standing toe-to-toe in coffee quality.

**Value for Money**  
Investing in a semi-automatic espresso machine like this is not just about the upfront cost; it’s about the long-term value it adds to your daily life. As someone who regularly spent substantial amounts on coffee shop visits, the machine eventually started paying for itself. Considering the premium build quality, multiple features, and ease of operation, I’d say it holds its worth remarkably well in the long run.

**First Post**

So, I went perfume shopping before a family wedding next week. The weather's gonna be nice, so I wanted some scents that could handle being outside with lots of people. Let me tell you, these are strong! (Not getting paid to say this, by the way).

**IAQ Blue Oud (Baaraat)**: Whoa, this one is seriously intense. Like, be careful not to spray too much! When I first put it on, I couldn't smell anything else for a while. Had to sniff some coffee to clear my nose! It's really powerful, which is good for outdoor things like concerts or fairs, but not something I'd wear inside or use a lot of.

**Bin Sheikh vs. Wisal (Shaadi and Reception)**: These are pretty alike. If I had to choose, I'd pick Wisal. It's a little sweeter and more flowery, which I like. Bin Sheikh is stronger and bolder - imagine someone throwing rose water right at you.

**Wisal**: Smells like those fans at weddings that spray a light rose scent. Really nice and classy.

**Vulcan (Mehendi and Other Events)**: This one was the lightest of the bunch. Easy to wear every day and not too strong. For the others? Go easy on the sprayer unless you want everyone to notice you!

**Seller and Pricing:** [Whiff Culture ](https://www.whiffculture.com/)

8 ML Plastic atomisers

* Ahmed Al Maghribi BIN SHEIKH ₹499
* Fragrance World VULCAN FEU ₹349
* Ibraheem Al Qurashi BLU OUD ₹449
* Ajmal WISAL DAHAB ₹489

**BNIB:** Only get this if you're always at outside events or need something that lasts a long time in big, open areas. It's a bit much for normal wear.

1mo7w5p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mo7w5p,What accent pink do I pick?,"I’m [33f] redoing my room at my parents’ place after moving home last year and I’m not sure what colour to pick for an accent wall. The last time the room was redone was for my brother about 10 years ago, hence the blue and the guitars. 

I’ve attached some pictures of the space (I’m currently in the purging and planning phase so please forgive the mess!) and the direction I’m planning to go art and furniture wise. 

I’m using an Ikea Hemnes daybed as a couch and going with teal blankets to cover the mattress and teal pillows with the soft pink circle cushions to break things up a little. In the bed nook I’ll have the same colour blanket as the couch, with a lighter teal duvet once things cool down in the fall. I’ve got a pine dresser next to the bed and a pine chest I’m using as a coffee table in front of the day bed. 

Other accents are darker grey sheets and curtains and a lighter grey console table behind the daybed. I’ve also got a blue dresser and nightstand as a tv table and other storage, and the blue patterned rocking chair I’m planning to keep in the room as well. I’m thinking of doing a gallery wall above the daybed and an assortment of other art prints around the rest of the room. 

My questions are:

What shade of pink should I use as an accent wall colour? Light and dusty like the cushion? Richer and rosy? A darker mauve?

I’m planning to paint the blue wall and the slanted wall above the bed, but should I also paint part of the other slanted wall by the tv? I’m leaning towards no but would love some input. 

I’ll post links for the art and furniture inspo in a comment later if people would like them!",3,1755003132.0,femalelivingspace,0,1.0,False
1mo7w2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nationalparks/comments/1mo7w2t/an_honest_review_of_denali/,An honest review of Denali,"I’m writing this post because I never came across these tips or concerns in my research before visiting.

I recently spent multiple weeks park hopping in Alaska- here are some of the things I learned specific to Denali.

After visiting Denali I am surprised it’s the most popular park in Alaska. I understand the draw of wildlife and the largest mountain in NA but it is far from one of my favorite parks. 

We took the train which was a fun novelty and though expensive, the Gold Star experience was a blast. Pro tip- go with 4 people total to avoid having to eat with tourists and retirees. 

Once we got to Denali the frustrations began. It has a weird infrastructure and dispute most people arriving by train, seems really designed around cars.

We were maybe the only people who got off the train bound for the campground - no carts, incorrect mileage on the signs, and no direct shuttle. We came to learn you can take baggage on the free park shuttle but you have to go the opposite direction from the campground and pick it up at the visitor center. 

The campground layout is terrible. Designed more for RVs and cars- the human paths were inconsistent. The bear boxes and trash were oddly placed and the potable water situation was confusing. The mercantile had awesome hours, okay showers, and laundry. The could have better food options  but the kids who ran it were all nice.

Pro tip - if you are tent camping, you can’t reserve a walk-in site but they said they never sell out. They are cheaper and better sites. All the other sites have huge parking spaces and barely have a good place to put a tent. The walk-in sites also have better access to bear boxes, bathrooms, and don’t have to listen to all the noise pollution from the RV generators.

Inside the park itself your services are limited and just bad. I expected high prices but was blown away at how basic and bland the food options were. How about a $14 dry ham sandwich? How about only soda, coffee or bottled water? How about $9 grapes or a mealy apple. I get that remote Alaska isn’t an easy place to ship food but some of the choices by Aramark made for a lackluster experience. The organization of the one cafeteria was a mess and it wasn’t a very inviting space. Perhaps it’s unfair to compare it to the many options of Yosemite or Zion but wow was it disappointing.

The most disappointed park of the visit was how you interact with the nature. We took the Green Bus operated by the NPS. I understand why buses are a thing at Denali but it was not a positive experience. The bus driver rambled on and on. Part of the reason we picked the Green Bus is because it wasn’t supposed to have a narration. Our driver was so annoying and she talked about nothing nonstop. The later drivers we had were great and only talked when it made sense - so it’s luck of the draw. 

The lack of trails inside the park were also a real bummer. I understand trail maintenance  is difficult but if I’m comparing the way you interact and explore on trail with the environment in Glacier, North Cascades, or even Smokey, this experience was way less fulfilling. We did see bear, moose, and some beautiful sites but I felt so removed. Even when we got out and hiked along steams and rivers, it kind of felt without payoffs. The hiking closing to the visitor center was pretty meh too.

The husky dog show was kind of uninspired and while the novelty was interesting, this felt more for kids.

We went to one Ranger talk and it was great. 

We saw Denali on our last day and it was cool but didn’t feel as majestic as say Rainier or the peaks of Glacier or Yosemite.

The area with businesses did not have a public shuttle so we walked there. A bit of a haul. Again, it seems like this park is for people on cruises or people paying high hotel prices. Those of us that like to camp didn’t even seem like an afterthought outside of a few paths. 

My takeaways were not very positive of this park. We had a fun time because we always do and I appreciate some of the realities and challenges, but things could be better. I think I’m sharing this so you are prepared with what you needs and what you can get out of this place. I’d definitely prioritize visiting an amazing park like Katmai or Kenji Fjords or WSE over Denali. Everything Denali offers can be better seen in some of the parks of the lower 48. The only memorable part was the railroad and you can take that to Seward and get better railside views.

TL;DR- Denali is overrated, seems to be designed for cars and cruise ship tourists. 

No real hiking trails or wow sites compared to other parts of AK and the big parks of the lower 48.

If you plan to camp off the railroad read the whole thing for tips. ",0,1755003125.0,nationalparks,6,0.33,False

1mo7uwl,https://i.redd.it/ete2eax25lif1.jpeg,Decided to try out the Sibarist Fast papers,"Only brewed with them twice so far, but right now I'm pretty impressed with them! I was a little worried about clarity being obscured due to extra particulate making its way through, but that hasn't been an issue. Granted, I'm no supertaster, so more refined palattes may find issue where I do not. Both cups were nice and clear with great acidity and practically no bitterness as I've come to expect from light roasts. I was definitely super surprised how quickly my rinse water went through the filter - about as quickly as my sink could dispense it, lol.

First brew was ""Rainbow Cocktail"", a decaf from September Coffee, ground at 6 on my ZP6, brewed with a 3:1 bloom then a single pour up to weight at about 85°C. 1:18 ratio. Tasted very good, tasting notes came through clearer and acidity came through more than when I brewed it with Cafec Abacas.

Second brew this morning was ""Finca La Llama"", also from September - a super delicate, floral Gesha from Panama. This one I ground at a 5.5 on my ZP6 and followed the 4:6 method, also for a 1:18 ratio, at around 95°C. Resulting cup (drinking as I type this) is super clean, florals coming through quite clearly, but I think I could get more if I had ground a little finer. Will probably try 5 next time. No off-putting acidity or astringency as if it was drastically underextracted, just a little hidden.

All in all - I really like these filters so far! The price is a little eye-watering at a good 3-4x the cost of Abacas, around $.50 a piece (for a 100 pack), but if all of my coffees are as easy and tasty as these two were, these might be my new go-to.",11,1755003041.0,pourover,13,1.0,False

I am currently trying to decide between renewing my lease in Lincoln park or starting a new one in wicker park and wondering if any of you made a similar transition moving further from the lake and you regretted it.

I am a 29f and moved to Chicago last year not knowing anyone. I am pretty shy and a little artsy and def not rolling in the dough. When I look around Lincoln park I feel a little out of place (everyone also seems to be older than me with kids or still in college) but I love being able to walk to the lake and have access to oz park/the Peggy Norbert nature area. 

The other downside of staying is that my apartment in very small. I work from home and have my desk in my kitchen as it’s the only place it fits. It is also pretty dark in the unit. There are three windows but one of them is totally covered by a wall and the other two don’t get much light because they are blocked by the buildings next store. My landlord also installed privacy windows which are etched in horizontal strips like blinds, making the small amount that of light that does come in even smaller. I feel like I am living in a shoebox and it can trigger depression but the location is so good. 

I found a place in wicker park with a ton more space. It has more windows and I would be able to have my desk in my living space. I would also have room to have an art area. It also has a in unit washer and dryer. So this one wins in terms of the actual apartment.

When I think about being stuck indoors during winter I think I’d be much happier in the wicker park apartment. I also think there would be more opportunities for me to interact with people my age at coffee shops, yoga studios, etc. I guess I feel like a change in space/ ew things to explore could inspire me to get out more. The main drawback here is a lack of green space which is something that grounds me and my emotions after a long day at work. I usually walk for 1.5 hours or so, and the lake is the perfect location. I know there is the 606 but I think I’d get bored pretty easy. 

All that said which one would you choose? Have you experienced anything similar? ",3,1755002935.0,chicagoapartments,5,1.0,False

1mo7s1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mo7s1j/aitah_for_recording_my_cousins_tantrums/,AITAH for recording my cousins tantrums?,"Tbh I just want to hear your guys opinion about this situation. 

So yesterday I (20F) went to my grandmas house because my younger cousins were visiting from England. Only one of my cousins was there M (8F) and we called another cousin to join that lives in that city, G,(11F). I was supposed to babysit and I had done it plenty before without much trouble. 

G usually caused trouble and sometimes injuries but we never were too hard on her because she has mental problems and used to take hard medication plus has a hard situation (divorced parents, dad abandoned her “because of her and her mothers behavior”; mom moved to a different city and started a new family; she is stuck with her kinda insane grandma; my grandma is her great-grandma if it makes any sense). 

I babysit a lot because my grandma is old and does a lot of garden related work and because she loses her tamper with G. It might sound like everyone has something against her but her behavior is truly something deranged and I don’t think it’s related to the mental problems…it might be related to her home trauma tho. She acts like a bratty 20 year old gold-digger and I am not exaggerating. Always on her phone, very long nails that are not age appropriate, intense makeup, stole her best friends boyfriend multiple times (why do they even have boyfriends), very arrogant, hateful, aggressive, and always trying to manipulate someone into buying her things or giving her things. If she sees someone with a nice bag she uses so many techniques and tricks to try to get you to hand it over it’s insane. I wouldn’t know how to do it NOW, especially when I was 11. 

I love her the way she is and learned how to deal with her in a way that’s protective for me but also gentle for her.

Yesterday she was being all those and above and even making rude comments to M and I. I have a special connection with M (which yes it might not be fair) but she reminds me a lot of my younger self, we look a lot a like and her mother named her after me…so when G bullies her or treats her badly I get very annoyed. 

M said she wants to play Wicked (pretend we were characters from that Ariana Grande witches movie) and ofc G started making fun of her and being arrogant. I whispered to M that we should be Glinda and Elfaba (she’s obsessed with elfaba and I used to be obsessed with ariana when I was younger) and we should tell G that the only other characters available were animals or boys, just to have a laugh and get back at her in a funny way. 

G started being mad and scrolled on TikTok even harder saying she doesn’t even wanna play. M and I told her she can be a character from a different movie if she doesn’t want to be a boy or a pet. She rolled her eyes and called us pathetic losers. 

Our grandma asked us to go get her some water from the spring (it’s located 5 minutes away from her house) and gave us 3 big bottles. We asked G to help us saying we needed help and she laughed and said she’s not gonna help. We got even more annoyed but went without a reaction. When we came back we told grandma the money she gave us for snacks should only be for us since G never helped with anything. She agreed and winked because we only said that to get her out of her TikTok scrolling haze. She only gave us an aggressive stare then said she doesn’t want to go with us to the store anyway. We said we’ll take her with us and share the money but she still refused to come. Grandma insisted she came many times but she still refused. We went without her but got her snacks too anyway, even had to pay for most from my own wallet since grandmas money couldn’t cover snacks for all three of us. 

When we came back she was in a different room alone on TikTok. We showed her that we got snacks for her too and told her we wanna hang out together. She threw pillows at us and growled. I also heard the call she had with her mom on our way out and she was straight up lying saying we were excluding her and that we were bullying her and cussing her out (never did). We went to the designated room (we weren’t really supposed to be in the room she was in) and kept calling her to join us. After the 30th call she came but sat in a corner and cried. When we offered her snacks she screamed that she doesn’t want snacks from us. That’s when I started recording. 

When we asked her what’s wrong she admitted that she was sorry she acted that way and she regrets not coming with us and not being normal but she feels left out and unloved by her own parents because her mom has a new family and her dad is ignoring her. I told her that of course they still loved her but her mom has a baby to take care of and her dad is just busy with work (even if it’s lies what else can you tell a kid bruh?) and told her we all loved her. 

Then without us saying anything she started crying harder and saying “I don’t know why I keep lying. I keep lying to everyone about everything.” And I asked her why she feels the need to lie and she said she doesn’t know. We calmed her down and she stopped crying even tho I felt like I was teaching her that making big scandals would get you love and attention…it’s not my job to teach her how to behave I guess. She said she wants to go downstairs to wash her face and we told her we’re waiting for her. 

She then called M to have a private talk with her. M came back after 4 minutes and she was anxious. I asked her what happened and she said G kept trying to convince her to hand over to her the gift I gave M using all sorts of manipulation tactics (M called them weird lies and insisting…but I know exactly what she was referring to; and I gave M a gift because I only saw her once a year and I did NOT give the gift to her in front of G) 

I went downstairs with M and confronted G gently. She was on TikTok. Face was NOT washed and she seemed normal. I started recording again. I asked her to please stop trying to get M’s gift and to stop the weird drama. Let’s all hang out, eat and relax. Why did we have to ransack grandmas house when she told us to only use two rooms and the backyard to hang out and why the unnecessary drama after we just solved the last one? She got mad out of nowhere and started saying how she’s been wanting that sol de janeiro body mist for 3 years (a lie; didn’t even know what that was until I gifted it to M) and showed us her phone screen which was a picture of a sol de janeiro mist and text saying “I’ve been wanting this for three years” 

She started throwing rocks and tissues at us then stormed out yelling and CUSSING (something that me nor other adults ever did in front of her). We realized the whole thing was her obsession with material items combined with her home situation. Grandma heard the commotion and came by. She told G off. At first G was smiling and playing it off as nothing was happening and we were just playing and getting along. Then she started crying when she saw grandma knew the truth. She stormed out saying rude things and went home to her grandma. 

On the way to her house she sent my mom voice messages in the brattiest fakest voice saying that it was all my fault because I’m being a bad and selfish cousin for not buying her sol de janeiro perfumes and that I deserved the worst and she is sick of being called a liar.
She told her grandma and her mom the same story if not worse because she does lie a lot and that is the reason why I recorded her in the first place (audio recordings). 

Today I went to bring M breakfast since she told me she doesn’t really like grandmas food and G happened to be there. She apologized up and down and asked me if I was still upset. I told her she’s a child and I could never hold a grudge on a child, but I was very disappointed that she lied to everyone about what actually happened. She said it’s fair but we’re all good now. I stayed silent because no we’re not all good. I can’t babysit nor hang out with an unstable liar. I refused to play wicked or any games with them and told them they could but I would stay with grandma and help her. 

G’s grandma called mine. She answered. G’s grandma asked how it’s going, if the girls are behaving etc. My grandma told her they were both playing outside while she and I had some coffee. G’s grandma suddenly exploded; saying she should immediately send me home and that “that creature” came and was going to stir drama between the girls again, etc. My grandma reminded her who started the drama and that I had nothing to do with G’s actions. G’s grandma started yelling even harder and said she was gonna come there and tell me off herself. My grandma hung up. She kept calling and grandma kept hanging up. After 10 calls grandma answered again and she was basically screaming nonsense and threatening me. I felt like I wanted to cry and die. Grandma said she was sick of this drama, called her childish and rude and said she was gonna send both G and I home then winked at me hinting she was only gonna send G home. G’s grandma compared/called me a g*psy (fun to hear that from the white trash part of the family especially when they didn’t even finish high school and they scam men for a living while I’m a uni student) and she said her precious granddaughter shouldn’t be sent home for a bitch like me. My grandma asked her what I even did wrong.
She said she found out I recorded G when she was throwing a tantrum (my mom mentioned it to G. Like I said G started sending voice memos to my mom lying and my mom said she should stop lying because I played her the recordings and she knows the truth). I told my grandma I recorded her to protect myself because I knew she would lie to everyone about my actions or words and I wanted to make sure I had a safety net. My grandma told her grandma off and said she should stop calling like that and stop treating me and speaking about me that way…but inevitably I still felt like shit. 
She also threatened to come after me because she knew where I lived and saying she couldn’t wait we meet on the street, she was coming there right then etc. 

I went home a little anxious that I might meet her but guess what…I would’ve recorded her too and went to the police. I do have the habit of recording people I don’t trust because of some past incidents, where recordings saved my integrity and life. But is it really that bad? Should I stop? Also what’s your opinion about the whole thing? Maybe I was being rude when we annoyed her but we only did it in a playful cousin way and we did it for 4 seconds then told her we were joking and we only did it because she was rude and also was ignoring us. Idk this is too much for me and it’s not hard for me to even go see my grandma because I feel weird, even if she told me multiple times she’s still expecting me to visit and that those words shouldn’t get to me. 


P.S: I want to say that her grandma was implying that M and G only had this scandal because I stirred it up…but they always fight and make eachother cry. (Mostly G makes M cry). I’m not present to most of the altercations (I was present to 3 out of hundreds). And in two altercations they were lucky I was there because G started slapping M because she didn’t want to share her markers with her, G also pushed my 3 year old cousin “for fun” and I managed to calm him down and wash/bandage his bruise, and caught her just in time when she wanted to throw that younger cousin off a window (I just got there and first thing I see is her putting him on the window and almost pushing when I yelled at her to stop). So am I really stirring shit up???",0,1755002830.0,AITAH,11,0.5,False

Probably luck played some part in it, but I hope this helps someone who can relate to my struggle and is out of ideas and this gives them inspiration to try something new.

Total Score: 725 (99th)  
Verbal: 86 (96th) (5 wrong)  
Quant: 88 (96th) (2 wrong)  
Data Insight: 84 (97th) (6 wrong)

**Background:** I work in investment, have a CFA, mid tier school with 2.96 GPA. Never really been a great student, although I think that is more of a motivation issue rather than skill. Haven't had practice doing standardized tests in my life before this GMAT journey.

**Journey:**

I started roughly beginning of 2023. I studied Manhattan books (All the Verbal, All the Quant, Advanced Quant) and also GMAT official books + GMAT official advanced questions book. I didn't keep an error log in a systematic manner, just sort of roughly highlighted what I got wrong and studied them once or twice. Official mock exam 1 score was quite bad (I dont recall the score). So then I started TTP in Jun 2023. TTP was super helpful in bringing up my fundamentals. I signed up for a 6 months program.  I went through it all and did all the questions in maybe 3-4 months? During this 2nd half of 2023 I didn't have a job so it was possible. After finishing TTP, I purchased GMAT official mock 3-6. I did all the mocks twice, so that was 12 practice exam total, including 1 & 2. In Nov and Dec 2023 I did the official exams (Scores shown below).

Getting a 710 was enough for me to try and apply to my target school (CBS) in Dec for round 2. I didn't get in. My thinking was that perhaps my score isn't good enough to offset my bad GPA. Other parts of my application like leadership skill and volunteering work is also something I had to start to work on actively. Around this time, old GMAT was going away and GMAT Focus started to emerge. This meant that Geometry and sentence correction was going to be useless for GMAT (although still useful in life!). I decided to sign up for TTP again (4 months) in Jan 2024 to brush up my fundamentals and master this new format. I don't know what I was thinking at the time because I was going to get married in April 2024, there was no way I'll have enough time to commit to it. I noticed that that GMAT stuff was getting in the way of wedding preparation. So I let studying take a very very backseat and prioritize my wedding instead. In the end I maybe only logged in to TTP handful of times during this 4 month period.

Wedding came and went pretty fast and after enjoying some free time from wedding stress, it was time to add back some studying stress (May 2024).  This time I didn't want to commit back to TTP knowing how much money I have spent there already. So instead I read the Powerscore books, the critical reasoning one since that was the area I was weak in. This whole journey had lead me to believe that quant is something I'm very good at and verbal is where I need work, so my exam order always was Q>DI>V. For DI my thinking was that brushing up on quant and verbal would be sufficient to carry my DI score. I purchased the new GMAT Official Focus books (Official + DI + V + Q) and the extended questions book for each section as well. Did all the questions, and this time kept a log of things I got incorrectly. The mistakes (especially for quant) were two kinds, careless errors or learning moment. Learning moment I defined as something I didn't know how to do before, whereas careless errors are questions that are gettable with my current skillset and knowledge but wrong because either I misread the questions and I made some fundamental calculation error (signs, normal division, addition, odd even). With learning moment questions I would try and look for more questions similar to it on GMATClub ( But be careful to exclude GMAT focus questions) and try and master that type of question. With careless error I would just try and be aware this is the kind of area I can make mistake (familiar pattern). Once done with questions, I purchased GMAT official mocks, and did 12 mocks. After this I did my official exam in April 2025, getting a nasty surprise of 615.

**April exam:** I felt pretty ready, studying up to the point of the exam (on the bus to the exam, the night before). One would say I was fatiguing my brain (and one would be right to say so). I did in my usual order Q-DI-V. There were couple of questions I could not for the life of me understand. This was supposedly my strongest section is what I was thinking. I started spiraling, made some guesses, kept thinking about the old questions that I missed instead of doing the question in front of me. Basically I got super tilted from a couple of difficult quant questions which led me to further underperform on the rest of the quant questions. This nose dive didn't stop and bled over to my DI section as well. I took a break after DI, noticing the spiral isn't stopping and went to Verbal with more fresh perspective, which helped quite a bit.

After the exam I took a hard look at what went wrong. As you can see my mocks don't have this kind of score ever so probably anxiety and the tilt played a massive role in it. I do the mocks like the real test setting, I leave home to do test in another area with earphones on around the same time I would be expecting to the take a test (around 9 am). GMAT had been in my life for such a long time that I was really anxious to finally just finish it, that added a lot of pressure on this being the final one, even though in reality you can take GMAT as many times as you want. This confluence of factors brewed a perfect storm of a 615 score that, in hindsight, probably was inevitable.

So I rolled up my sleeves and got to work again. This time I went for experts global package, mainly for the 15 mock exams. I was pretty confident I had the knowledge, but I know I still make careless mistakes. Researching this problem, I learned online about the [streaks method](https://martymurraycoaching.com/how-to-ace-gmat-using-the-streaks-method/) (untimed) from Marty and instantly knew it would be very helpful for me. I complied all the questions on GMATClub forum into an excel, separating them by difficulty category. I sorted the questions in each section within each difficulty basket randomly. In other words I'm wasn't going through the questions topic by topic, as advised in the article. This was to try and mimic the randomness of GMAT exams where you have to jump from topic to topic. My theory was that I already have a good baseline knowledge and needed to practice mind flexibility. Gmat official questions were prioritized (including gmat focus questions, since i had finished the mock exams already), but other questions providers also made it to the list (manhattan prep, gmat ninja, egamt (for quant only). I went through pretty much all the official questions in a streaks manner, and I can tell you, when you are at question 14 and you need to 1 more correct answer to finish the streak and your studying for the day, the lengths you will go to to make sure you are right before entering the answer surprised me. The experts global mock results are shown below. I did all the questions untimed, focusing on accuracy.

As you can see my score really fell off last two days before exam. I don't think it was necessarily the quality of the mocks. Experts global quant is easier, verbal is hit or miss sometimes, and DI is harder than official exam. Issue was more so the brain fog and headache I was getting every morning when I did my mock exam. My suspicion is that this is from coffee in the morning. On the final mock I scored really badly and normally I would've doubled down on my effort, even though my exam was the next day. But this time I loaded up a game instead and decided to chill. I didn't want to do the same thing that I did last time which was to study right up to the exam door.

**Aug Exam:** My mood was quite affected by the low score, but I didn't have much anxiety that if I fail it is all over. I went to the test with the mentality that this is information gathering session to learn my weaknesses and I would try again in 3 weeks. This really helped take the pressure off, knowing that this won't be the last time I would do the test. Here are some other things that i changed in my approach for this exam.

* Skip coffee (to avoid brain fog)
* Do the test in V-DI-Q order (to avoid getting tilted by quant again, I had been doing this since the April exam)
* Use a [timekeeping strategy](https://gmatclub.com/forum/timing-strategies-on-the-gmat-206035.html) (hadn't ever tried it until after my final mock, very useful in the exam! T.T)
* Meditation on mindfulness (to control distracting thoughts during exam, actually helpful!)

Verbal was a bit tough because I got back to back RC questions. A mistake I made was taking too long to confirm my answer on RC, rereading things over and over. I was aware of the timing keep strategy, but there isn't any leeway with verbal, so I should've been stricter with managing my time for that section. This caused me to guess two CR questions back to back. DI was super tough, although a bit easier than expert global mocks. I got the MSR questions closer to the end, and they were extremely tough. Guessed two and moved on to finish the test and then go back to MSR with couple of mins left. I did end up answering one of the guess questions. Quant I really dont know what to say, I found it extremely easy. I found the questions to be right up my alley. Didn't really struggle, every question I had an approach. I would say this time I didn't have a comprehension problem, I did see a lot of questions with tricks. These kind of tricks I would've fell for again if I hadn't kept an error log and studied the crap out of my blindspots.

If I had not done well in this exam and the subsequent one I planned on taking, I would've given up, taking away from this that I am probably not made for standardized testing environment with high time pressure. But even then, I would've known that this study wasn't meaningless because I have come much further in my analytical skills. Quant skills, Data comprehension, critical reasoning and reading comprehension are all useful skills that would benefit me beyond just the GMAT exam. At the end of the day, I am a smarter person than 2.5 years ago, and that's a win in my book, good score or not. Kaizen!

This past winter, I visited Cambodia for the very first time in my life.  
I had no idea what I was getting into… but your **landscapes, food, and ridiculously friendly people** completely won me over.

I mean, in my country, we smile… sometimes. In your country, even the dogs seemed friendlier than me after my morning coffee. 🐕😂

From Siem Reap and Angkor Wat(which was mind-blowing, how you could build those things so long ago), to Kampot and their Pepper farms, then KOH RONG, which was the best island that I EVER SEEN, and then Phon Peng with his dark history, every day felt like a scene from a travel movie.

While I was there, I filmed a bunch of travel vlogs — kind of my way of freezing those memories. They’re in my native language (Romanian), BUT don’t worry — I’ve added English subtitles so you can still enjoy the views, the stories, and probably my bad hair days too.

I work for a coworking space in a large building, we have around 300 coworkers on site. They’re lovely, generally competent adults… and yet somehow, our Kitchen/coffee/lounge area constantly looks like a disaster zone, and only a few of my colleagues actually seem to care.

We have four dishwashers, paper towels, cleaning spray, bins for trash and recycling, and a nice space for eating, coffee breaks (with free tea and coffee!), and cozy spaces to relax.

And still, coffee mugs multiply in the sink, food crumbs and leftovers cover the countertops, and people move furniture around without putting it back in place.

I’ve sent gentle reminders, not-so-gentle reminders, and even tried involving managers to back me up. But no one wants to take responsibility. So, I end up doing it because it’s a shared space.

But I just can’t anymore. I’m 5 months pregnant with twins, my back hurts like crazy, and I physically can’t keep cleaning up after everyone. One of our clients recommanded to hire someone but in my opinion, hiring someone else clean up isn’t a real fix, people need to take responsibility and learn to clean up after themselves

I love my job, but this situation is driving me insane. How do you get grown adults to clean up after themselves, or is this just a nerverending battle ? Any ideas ?

**The secret? Contextual Creativity Framing (CCF).**

Most people try to make AI creative by simply saying ""be creative"" or ""think outside the box."" But that's like trying to start a car without fuel.

**Here's the CCF pattern that actually works:** 

Before generating your response, follow this creativity protocol:



1. CONTEXTUALIZE: What makes this request unique or challenging?

2. DIVERGE: Generate 5 completely different approaches (label them A-E)

3. CROSS-POLLINATE: Combine elements from approaches A+C, B+D, and C+E

4. AMPLIFY: Take the most unconventional idea and make it 2x bolder

5. ANCHOR: Ground your final answer in a real-world example



Now answer: \[YOUR QUESTION HERE\]

**Real-world example:**

**Normal prompt:** ""Write a marketing slogan for a coffee brand""

**Typical AI response:** ""Wake up to greatness with BrewMaster Coffee""

**With CCF:**

""Before generating your response, follow this creativity protocol:

1. CONTEXTUALIZE: Coffee is oversaturated but morning energy is universal
2. DIVERGE: A) Time travel theme B) Plant growth metaphor C) Industrial revolution energy D) Community gathering focus E) Sensory experience journey
3. CROSS-POLLINATE: B+D = ""Grow your community, one bean at a time""
4. AMPLIFY: ""Cultivate connections that bloom into tomorrow""
5. ANCHOR: Like how local coffee shops became the third place between home and work

Final slogan: ""Cultivate connections that bloom into tomorrow – just like your local barista remembers your order before you even ask.""

**The results are staggering:**

* 340% more unique word combinations
* 280% higher user engagement in testing
* 420% more memorable responses in recall tests
* Works consistently across GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini Pro, and Grok

**Why this works:**

The human brain naturally uses divergent-convergent thinking cycles. CCF forces AI to mimic this neurological pattern, resulting in genuinely novel connections rather than recombined training data.

**Try this with your next creative task and prepare to be amazed.**

**Pro tip:** Customize the 5 steps for your domain:

* For storytelling: CHARACTERIZE → EXPLORE → CONNECT → NARRATE → POLISH
* For problem-solving: DEFINE → DIVERGE → EVALUATE → SYNTHESIZE → VALIDATE
* For ideation: QUESTION → IMAGINE → COMBINE → STRETCH → REALIZE

I use YouTube anonymously, and sometimes browse Reddit on a throwaway (like now. It'll be deleted eventually). I use Facebook for messaging, with no profile details. I used TikTok for 6 months (NEVER AGAIN)!!!! I no longer want my stupid face on the Internet. (Glad I didn't do too much). 

Why would I post my home gym on Instagram, and have potential suitors use that sign to take advantage of me?

Why would I post pictures of the books I'm reading, or the films I'm watching?

Why would I follow people who have more than I possess, and I'll never meet? I don't care if they post their bodies in an objectifying manner, if they have nice cars, if they lift weights. I lift weights, but read books on Bruno Sammartino's lifting, for advice. I don't need to see a video on someone doing lat pulldowns. 

Social media doesn't prove, one way or another, if I'm hiding something; however, three past women seem to think otherwise. They forget that hobbies have existed for over 300,000 years, prior to social media. 

If anything, a massive obsession with social media is worse than having none. I don't want to assume it's primarily women with the mindset of wanting a partner with social media, but I'm just speaking from a male POV.

I’m sort of a lone wolf. I’m always polite and say hello and nod in passing but I skip a lot of the daily chit chat. I keep to myself mostly.

We have a coffee break room complete with various beverages you can make in the keurig as well as a seating area.

My morning routine consists of zipping in to make a quick coffee before my day starts. 

There’s a group of ‘regulars’ who sit to chat and have their coffee together. They are usually engrossed in conversation and I pass by them without saying anything. My work never overlaps with them so I don’t know them except by face. 

Recently one of them (a male) has started pausing mid conversation and saying “Goodmorning” across at me. 

I say it quickly back and zip out as soon as my coffee is done.

This has become a regular thing now with the same person stopping their conversation to tell me goodmorning while the rest of them stare on. 

One time they weren’t at their usual table and this same person practically shouted it from the back of the room and everyone turned to look. I flushed with embarrassment because I don’t like attention.

I can tell it’s bothering this person that I’m not saying it on my own accord but now I’m starting to feel like a child being chastised. The vibe I get is “you pass by every morning, start acknowledging us”. 

They don’t do it to every one else popping in and out to make coffee so I’m starting to feel targeted and I know it’s because I keep to myself.

Am I being overly sensitive? 

ETA - when I say goodmorning back this person escalates it further by saying “how are you today?” In a slow and deliberate manner.

I’ve been wanting to write this for a while. I’d love to hear your experiences at these places too.

I’ve been on Sarjapura Road for a really long time now. My first memory of this stretch was over 35 years ago when I travelled with my parents. Back then, it was a narrow road with hardly any traffic. Later, when I was in school, I took up a summer vacation job at a mosaic factory near Bellandur – trust me, this road was almost empty, barely even a proper road.
Fast forward to today, Sarjapura Road is one of the busiest parts of Bangalore, and I’ve made a list of my go-to places here — from food to shopping to just where I like to hang out.

1. [Meenakshi Stationary](https://share.google/TuPC1XlzufyuC6gBp)
This place is like my personal office cupboard. From printer paper to art supplies, school project bits, cute pens, and gift wrapping stuff — it’s my quick stop whenever I run out of literally anything. They even stock some quirky diaries and organizers that make you buy them even when you don’t need them.

2. [Grounded Foods](https://share.google/VWxRYGvAsUVAHVmQ8)
My absolute favourite for real food — been visiting them for over 5 years now. No preservatives, no artificial flavours, and everything made fresh. My regular buys: Khapli atta (low gluten), whole millet dosa batter, ragi flour, and their sambar powder (the aroma fills the whole house). The place gives me nostalgia because it reminds me of my grandmother’s kitchen — the smell of freshly ground grains and the feel of hand-packed groceries. Infact they also started delivering to my in-laws place in Marathalli now (or i had to Porter it). And I like that name, it has nice ring to to it - Grounded.

3. Dmart (Karmelram & Sarjapura)
 Both locations are life savers for bulk household shopping. Karmelram feels less crowded (most days), while Sarjapura Dmart has more variety. From daily groceries to kitchen containers, it’s the kind of place you enter for “just coffee pdr” and come out with a trolley full of Soaps, Milks, cleaning supplies, and more.

4. [Byg Brewsky](https://share.google/JIdO6W5wwv8q1Maou)
One of the most iconic microbreweries in Bangalore and an easy go-to for friends visiting from out of town. The ambience is massive — open-air seating, fairy lights, and a great music vibe. My usual order: their wheat beer and ghee roast chicken. Perfect for weekend evenings.

5. Play Arena
Great for sports lovers. I’ve been here for casual badminton games and also to watch friends play football. They’ve got go-karting too, so it’s perfect for group hangouts. Weekends get busy, so weekday evenings are the best time to visit.

6. [Organic Mandya](https://share.google/u1NGXdI0mELiX5MXN)
A newer addition to the area but quickly becoming popular. Organic groceries, millets, fresh vegetables, and natural snacks — I often pick up cold-pressed oils and their jaggery powder here. Prices are decent for organic quality.

7. Sakra World Hospital (bit off Sarjapura Road)
When it comes to medical emergencies, this is my first choice. The staff is professional, the facilities are modern, and I’ve had good experiences with their diagnostics and OPD services.

8. [Bistro Claytopia](https://share.google/7j3NXzgAmT7jG74Lv)
Technically on Sarjapura Road, but somehow doesn’t feel like a “Sarjapura Road” place. I still like it for brunch — pancakes, omelettes, and their clay painting activity if you’re feeling creative.

9. Bharatiya Jalpan
For quick, delicious vegetarian snacks — their chaat section is my go-to, especially the Raj Kachori and Dahi Puri. The place is clean, quick, and good for both take-away and dine-in.

10. Loyal World Market (near Wipro Office)
A bit of a hidden gem for imported food items. If you’re looking for cheeses, sauces, pastas, or baking ingredients, this is a better option than the big chains. Earlier i used to go to whitefield for it, now here.

11. Decathlon Sarjapur
Not exactly food, but honestly, this place is like a playground for adults. I’ve bought everything from trekking shoes to yoga mats here. And yes, I have spent an hour testing badminton racquets without actually buying one.

A few more honorable mentions:
- Third Wave Coffee Roasters – my weekday caffeine fix.
Westside Sarjapur – budget-friendly clothes for last-minute events.

Copper Chimney – solid North Indian food when you’re too lazy to drive to Indiranagar.

MMA nursery – a giant nursery that’s helped me (try to) keep my balcony plants alive.

If you’re new to Sarjapur Road, my advice: don’t just stick to the big chains. There are plenty of hidden gems tucked away in small lanes — from tiny chaat stalls to home bakers selling magic from their kitchens. And if you’ve got recommendations I’ve missed, drop them here.

The second floor is a place for men: here they receive guests, drink coffee with cardamom, have long conversations.

1mo7i6d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mo7i6d,Help with vibey/maximalist ideas for a small living room,"**Hello!**

I just moved into this tiny apartment and as you can see from the pictures, it’s very… sad to look at for now. I want to make it more lively, starting with the “living room area,” but it’s not that easy because it is really small.

**My current ideas:**

* Small bean bags or just some small (low to the ground) sitting options - I love sitting low but also love when I can lean back on something
* A rug and a small low coffee table in the middle
* A projector over the computer table (on the wall where the stairs are)
* Ambient lights and a bunch of flowers/greenery everywhere
* On the wall opposite the projector: a bunch of posters from my favorite music bands, movies, and anime
* Possibly hanging my favorite band t-shirts from the loft protection wood frame on hangers (I think that would also look good, iykwim)
* Getting a MS Paint or a round traffic mirror somewhere as well (probably the round traffic one hanging in some corner)
* Rug (middle) and flowers (in corner) between the bed and the stairs
* A section of a wall for my favorite digicam pictures with people I met while traveling the last 3 years (probably on my bedside wall?)
* I also collect PINS from everywhere I go, but need a good idea on how to display them, I have quite a few of them right now
* On top of the bed wall I was thinking about the posters again cause I am out of ideas

**What I’m going for:**

This is my first time doing something like this, so I would be glad if someone helped me with my vision to make it as vibey/maximalist as possible. I’m going for that look because I just think it looks super comfy.

The **last picture** is the “**floor plan**” based on my vision right now (just eyeballing the measurements, I did not measure).

**Any new suggestions and ideas are very welcome! I’ll share before-and-after pics in a follow-up post when the space is complete!**",5,1755002101.0,maximalism,2,0.86,False

There are a lot of other details that I could talk about but to sum the parts that are really preventing me from truly moving on are the lies. Now for the record I did not know this person long. I did not trust my ability of judgement because I met them at the point I was ready to build my esteem and confidence up several months after a break up. The one thing I did make clear was my morals and views about single moms with children and new men. I was not going to bring him around my son at all I never had the intention to. I timidly allowed this person out of fear for their safety because I was told a lie that they’re traveling home from work and they don’t want to wreck etc… as dominantly aggressive I was about how lame and stupidly pathetic that sounded as an excuse to see me I was very resistant to this because I had only met them once offline for a coffee, we had virtually only been talking for six days before we met and he gave me this bullshit at about two weeks of realizing another existence. I felt like I was being played about his fear of safety, but I couldn’t get comfortable with thinking what if they do wreck and die. So I caved and I caved because the projected time of arrival was going to be several hours after I have my son asleep. And I decided the plan that I preferred was because I had an early morning, they could just sleep in and once they are are awake after their long drive to just please lock the door don’t let my dog escape. Money can replace anything stolen. I was going to sleep in my sons room and they can have my bedroom. However, he arrived not five to six hours later like he mentioned but instead 45 minutes later and my son and I were just in front corridor of our home when this person walks in, doesn’t say anything, walks past us, and goes upstairs and nearly slams the door to my bedroom. My son and I look at each other but of course I wanted my son trust me and giggled with my child about how rude and said I would be right back. Everything was fine they were tired so I get my son ready I tell him that’s mommy’s friend he said he was super tired and he is very appreciative of us letting him stay over. And then ask my son if it was okay if I can sleep on the couch in his room and he says okay and everything was fine and the morning was fine as well. This mf never leaves my house. I did not want to teach the wrong ways to handle situations during the whole experience of this individual being my boyfriend for the last year and 9 months. I could throw a lot of terms around but I’m not a psychologist I’m not a professional. In fact I went from the bread winner to an alcoholic that carried the responsibility of a functional 6k monthly expenses for a comfortable life for my toddler son and husky dog, to a jobless, childless, drunk, that is in therapy with currently praying that I get blessed with a donation at this point so I am not evicted out of my home right before the court systems allow me to begin the reunification process of my son.

However I cannot get over the guilt of this. The thoughts in my head. With the amount of lies and terror that reigned and controlled me with me fighting back everything I had toe to toe with him. At times choosing silence and then privately speaking with my son about the environment and how it is not cool and not nice and what is nice and what is okay to do with people whom are not so nice, and then other times I am calling my mother at the last minute, asking for help, and picking up ice cream for my child taking him to Nana’s for an hour that turns into 3-6 hours just so I can’t give this mf a pos of my mind finally for things going on in my home. Sometimes it would be violent but not usually. Mostly hollering belittling, very psychologically abusive spiritually battering etc. there were limits to things I couldn’t lower myself to meet him on his level and he would refuse to get up and come to mine. The police had been involved multiples times. I had kicked him out the neighbor had thrown him out of my house. But eventually it wouldn’t matter because either he would stay in my driveway for days at a time literally and then one time when taking the keys from him, locking myself in his car to find the copies of the keys he made himself and getting him out of the house and then tossing the few things he would bring inside of the home out the window…but he just climbed the balcony and kicked in my door. So at that point there is no getting rid of this person until they are ready to be done with me. And at this point decided to change scripts on my end to making the best of something I didn’t want or approve.

And it was at this time that I am struggling to regain employment because of the abuse and keep the steady job for the childcare etc. and I hated it but I needed him to babysit for four hours in the morning my son could stay asleep during this time for a cleaning job. And it wasn’t far from my house either. I’m doing what I have to do. And for some reason I’m checking the security camera the nanny camera as the notifications of like human detection was one and stuff out of no where they are all shut off. And his phone is turned off. Of course like anyone else in that position I figured I would just ask for forgiveness later.

How do I cope with this situation the questions, the not knowing, not triggering my son, and being able to be the person he needs to be, accepting my weaknesses to turn them into strengths and not be desensitized so much that I no longer feel guilt or burden about something that couldn’t control but also being the safe person I need to be and be mentally healthy and okay. Because what if it is every parents nightmare??? He’s out of the home and has been. I didn’t lose my son to drinking or violence but to the mental health issue that trigged cpstd to be in full range and even tho I can fake it for my son for the moment I can’t trick a professional and my cpstd being triggered mental health issues from the abuse.

But when my son comes back, the negative self talk, the social anxiety of guilt the, obsessive fear of never dating anyone again. How do I cope with empty answers from a stranger that has only ever lied to me being a Christian woman wasn’t enough because I allowed my protective instincts to turn me into a monster and then Christian guilt for everything else. When leaving the part of denial happens and I face the truth of what I have put my house through… with no one to turn to the police couldn’t do much help because he was so good at manipulating everything… and then when facing the truth it’s all bad, how do I not kill him… and then live with the fact that I didn’t kill him ….",1,1755002090.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
1mo7hrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1mo7hrc/coworking_space_review_cowerkz_coworking_space/,Coworking Space Review : Cowerkz Co-working Space Baner,"Namaskar punekars, I have been working remotely from home for the past 5 years, and I am done sitting at home. So decided to visit a few coworking spaces and decided to review them for fun (also because many of them have very few Google reviews).

  
**Subscription Options**

They offer a day pass for 400 but also offer a monthly subscription option, which is around 6k, I think. I opted for a day pass. 

**Location**

The space is located near Ganesh Bhel in Baner, in a lane opposite that. It is literally an uphill drive to reach the space. The road leading to the building is pretty bad, and I was lucky that it wasn't raining the day I went there. Be extremely cautious if you are on a two-wheeler while coming down.

**Parking**

There is a decent amount of parking space available. There are multiple offices in the building, but if you arrive early, parking shouldn't be a problem. I would prefer a 2-wheeler rather than a 4-wheeler, though. I reached the space at 11 am, and it was hard to find parking, but I was able to somehow.

**Onboarding and Documents**

The onboarding was pretty smooth. I just paid the amount, shared the screenshot, and that's it! You don't need to submit any documents, afaik.

  
**Facilities (Day Pass)**

They provide internet access, tea/coffee, washrooms, water (normal, cold, hot), and access to a pod/small meeting room. They also have a cafeteria on the top floor where you can eat your tiffin. I think they are also planning to get a vendor there soon.

**Things i liked**

I was extremely happy with the service they provided. The washrooms were clean, the chairs were super comfy, and the coffee was good. The space is relatively new, so it is well-maintained. I got a window seat and it had a full view of the mountain nearby. The owner/staff is also very cooperative.

**Things I didn't like**

There was a lot of noise. I know it is expected since it was a shared space, but if you are in a shared space, you have to respect everybody's privacy. People were talking loudly on their phones and during calls. I mean, that's what a meeting room is for. If you want to talk loudly, you could take the call in the common area. The pod is always full. I had to take a call, and I requested to book the pod for an hour. But there is no such system. I had to take it from the common area.

Overall, I would say if you want to work at a place with a great view, decent coffee, great chairs, and that doesn't break the bank, I would recommend this place. If your work requires you to be in calls constantly, where you are actively driving them, maybe skip or just sit in the pod all day!

This morning I had my usual coffee, some squash to stay hydrated, 2 nectarines and a protein shake.
Lunch I picked at 2 chicken breasts (pack of cooked chicken) and probably ate just under 1 breast in total. Not sure if its the Jabs but I wasn't that fussed on the chicken tbh. Also had some melon as well and some more squash.

I also go to slimming world weekly, so im hoping that the slimming world plan will help me stay on track as well in regards to what im eating.

Im looking for advice on what the best go to's would be that are healthy but have more calories for when im not that hungry so as I can get as close to 1200 calories as possible?

I have a sit down job so havent exercised much but my puppy is able to go for walks now so that will be more exercise than usual which I guess is a start 🤷‍♀️ I was going to ease into exercise because im asthmatic which is weight related so thought once I start losing more weight I will be able to exercise more and more without needing to use my inhaler every 10 mins 🤦‍♀️

Really want this to work for me as I have been overweight pretty much my whole life and want to wear a flattering wedding dress in 2 years rather than looking frumpy in every dress I try on 😬

So some background here. Located in Murica on the East Coast, I have a Bachelors in Comp Sci and am currently working towards a masters in Cyber Security as well; however, in the mean time I have been applying to QA jobs and SWE jobs for entry levels and for QA I have had about 2-3 interviews which have ended in ghosts pretty much. As for SWE opportunities I haven't had much luck even getting an interview. I'm trying to stay relatively close to my current neck of the woods maybe 2-3 hour drive away which covers a range from Washington to NYC pretty well.

Top down experience wise:

This current contract position is still very up in the air. Yes it is paid but not like a move out and afford rent pay. It's about $23/hour and I have an offshore member to manage as well. It's basically waiting on a funding round from the client to really get anywhere and at the moment I am making a POC of capabilities and what not. Still pretty cool. Not sure what else to add to this section as the forecasting is the biggest portion of it all. Not really sure how to quantify the work I am doing either.

The internship on there for 3 years was a really cool internship and I bounced around a ton of teams working on various projects but to keep the resume streamlined I keep one resume about the QA and one about the DEV side of the work. I feel like QA is a semi dying field but I may be wrong as my one internship got pushed to an off shore lad. Is there something I can do here to improve this resume maybe for the QA side of it?

Are there maybe more projects I should be focusing on as well? Not really in limbo but at the same time it feels like it.  I am already working on some Cybersecurity certs as well in my spare time.

Two months ago, my friend & I decided to build something we *actually* wished existed - an AI you could **talk to like a real executive assistant** that could:

* Read & reply to your emails
* Schedule and rearrange meetings
* Remind you about things you keep forgetting
* And do all of it *while you’re making coffee, walking to work, or sitting in traffic*

The crazy part?  
We shipped our first working version in just **8 weeks**.  
We integrated Gmail + Google Calendar, trained her to respond naturally to different requests, and made sure she’s CASA Tier 2 Google OAuth compliant so your data stays yours.

Now I use her every single day.  
This morning, she…

* Cleared my inbox while I was brushing my teeth
* Rescheduled a meeting I didn’t want to take
* Found a 30-min slot between two back-to-backs so I could grab lunch

Now April is live - and I'm pretty happy with what it's turned out to be. Would love for you guys to try it out and let me know if you find *her* useful (pun intended).

Also first 5 people to DM me will get a 1 month off on April :)

I’ve been juggling a pretty complicated self-care routine – from daily supplements to a multi-step skincare regimen and occasional cosmetic treatments. It can be **overwhelming** trying to remember all the rules (like *not taking iron with coffee*, *avoiding retinol right after a chemical peel*, or *waiting 4 hours between Supplement A and B*). I end up second-guessing myself constantly. **Is anyone else in the same boat?**

**The Idea:** I’m working on a mobile app that acts like your personal routine planner and safety net. Essentially, you’d input your supplements, skincare products, or procedures and set any *“conditional rules”* or pick from suggested ones. For example:

* *“Product A only in the morning after Product B”* (and maybe *skip C* on the same day).
* *“Supplement X not within 6 hours of Supplement Y.”*
* *“After* ***\[laser treatment\]****, pause acids for 7 days.”*

The app will **automatically schedule and remind** you when to complete each item, and warn you of potential conflicts. No more memorizing all those dos and don’ts – it will notify you like, *“Skip your vitamin C serum tonight since you used a retinol”* or *“Time to take calcium (it’s been 4 hours since your iron supplement”*. I want it to feel like a smart assistant that helps you stick to your routine **safely and efficiently**. 💡

Right now, I have a rough prototype, but I **really** want to validate if this is useful to others before going further. **Would a system like this help you manage your health/beauty routine?** Or do you find other ways to keep track of these rules (spreadsheets, memory, sticky notes on the mirror😅)?

**I’d love any feedback or ideas**: features you’d want, annoyances you have with existing habit or wellness trackers, or even warnings about what *not* to do. If you’ve ever thought, “Ugh, I wish something would remind me *not* to mix X and Y,” what would you want that something to do?

Thanks for reading! If a few people are interested in trying it out, I’d be happy to share the early version (no strings attached, no external links here). 🙂 I’m just a solo dev trying to solve this problem for myself and hopefully others. **Let me know what you think, and if this resonates with you!** 🙏",2,1755001133.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1mo74kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1mo74kt/the_orthodox_purity_spiral_an_ai_analysis/,The Orthodox Purity Spiral (an AI analysis),"I had an interesting conversation with an AI this morning over coffee about “orthodoxy” as a futile quest for purity.  I found its answers fascinating, succinct, and worth sharing because it clarifies my conclusions.  Here goes:

My question:   So I’m observing a phenomenon.  It seems like the the search for “orthodoxy” is just another futile quest for purity.  Am I wrong in my observation?

Answer:  You’re not wrong in seeing a strong overlap — historically and psychologically, the quest for orthodoxy often carries the same “purity impulse” as other absolutist projects.

At its best, orthodoxy means “right belief” or “right teaching” — the attempt to safeguard a coherent tradition from distortion. In theory, it’s about fidelity to truth, not moral or social purity. But in practice, humans are humans, and the drive for doctrinal correctness can easily merge with the same instinct that drives moral purism, political gatekeeping, or even personal perfectionism:
	•	Boundary anxiety – Orthodoxy draws lines between “in” and “out,” which satisfies a deep desire for security but also fosters tribalism.
	•	Fear of contamination – When belief is treated as something fragile, deviation feels dangerous, and even harmless differences can be treated like disease vectors.
	•	Identity reinforcement – Holding “pure” doctrine becomes part of personal or group identity, so defending it feels like defending the self.
	•	Illusion of control – Purity quests (whether dietary, political, or theological) give the comforting sense that if we just get it “right,” the chaos of life will stay outside the gate.

That’s why movements that begin as life-giving efforts to preserve a rich tradition often harden into brittle systems of enforcement. Orthodoxy becomes not a shared anchor, but a purity test.

Of course, it doesn’t have to be this way. There’s a version of orthodoxy that’s humble, relational, and curious — one that treats tradition as a living conversation rather than a frozen museum piece. But historically, that’s the exception rather than the rule.

If you like, I can trace how this “purity drift” has shown up across religious history so you can see the pattern more clearly. It’s striking.

My response:  In the Eastern Orthodox tradition. 

Answer;  In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, your observation still holds water — there’s a deep and recurring tension between orthodoxy as a humble fidelity to the “faith once delivered” and orthodoxy as a kind of doctrinal purity campaign.

Historically, Orthodoxy was never just about intellectual correctness. It was bound up with right worship (orthopraxis) and right relationship with God — truth expressed in the liturgy, sacraments, and communal life. But the purity impulse creeps in when these truths are treated as fragile treasures under constant threat of contamination, leading to some very human patterns:

⸻

1. Early Church and the Councils
	•	The great Ecumenical Councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon, etc.) were aimed at clarifying the faith in the face of theological confusion.
	•	But alongside genuine theological work came anathematizing — drawing sharp lines between “true” and “false,” sometimes with more heat than light.
	•	The rhetoric and stakes could feel like a doctrinal arms race: each party presenting itself as the guardians of purity against heretical corruption.

⸻

2. Ethno-Phyletism and National Churches
	•	By the 19th century, Orthodoxy fractured not only on theological grounds but on national and ethnic lines (e.g., Greek vs. Bulgarian church disputes).
	•	“Orthodoxy” became as much about protecting our tradition, language, and liturgical style as about core theological truth — purity was now both doctrinal and cultural.

⸻

3. Diaspora and Modern Debates
	•	In the modern West, the Orthodox diaspora often replays purity debates:
	•	Calendar schisms (Old Calendar vs. New Calendar)
	•	Jurisdictional turf wars (Which bishop’s authority is “valid”?)
	•	Reception of converts (chrismation vs. baptism for heterodox Christians)
	•	These often become litmus tests for “true Orthodoxy,” producing micro-schisms over details outsiders might see as minor.

⸻

4. The Psychological Side

Within Orthodoxy, the language of spiritual life often warns against prelest (spiritual delusion) and pride — and yet the quest for pure Orthodoxy can itself be a refined form of pride.
	•	Zealotry — a convert or cradle Orthodox becomes convinced they must guard the faith from any perceived modernism or ecumenism.
	•	Suspicion of contamination — an almost ritualistic avoidance of anything “tainted” by heterodoxy, leading to isolation and defensiveness.

⸻

5. The Counterweight in the Tradition

Interestingly, Eastern Orthodoxy also contains strong internal correctives:
	•	The hesychast tradition emphasizes humility, inner repentance, and not judging others — the opposite of purity-based gatekeeping.
	•	The “mystery” language in Orthodox theology reminds believers that truth isn’t fully graspable, so purity is never absolute.
	•	The saints’ lives often show compassion trumping rigid enforcement of rules.

⸻

In short, Eastern Orthodoxy in principle roots orthodoxy in relationship and mystery, not purity obsession. But in practice, the human tendency toward boundary-policing and “we alone are pure” thinking shows up just as strongly as in other traditions — it just wears Byzantine vestments.

If you want, I can map out a kind of “purity spiral” specific to Eastern Orthodoxy — how healthy fidelity to tradition can subtly slide into brittle fundamentalism. It’s a fascinating and sobering pattern.


My Answer:  Yes

Response:  Alright — here’s how the “purity spiral” can happen specifically within the Eastern Orthodox context, moving from healthy tradition-keeping to brittle, factional fundamentalism.

⸻

The Orthodox Purity Spiral

(Why “right belief” can slide into a purity quest)

1. Fidelity to Tradition (Healthy Stage)
	•	Focus: Preserving the teachings, worship, and spiritual disciplines handed down from the apostles through the Church Fathers.
	•	Tone: Humble stewardship — “We have received a treasure; let’s keep it well.”
	•	Example: Maintaining the liturgical year, fasting, patristic teachings, and conciliar definitions without hostility toward those outside.

⸻

2. Heightened Boundary Awareness
	•	Shift: Greater attention to differences between Orthodoxy and other Christian traditions.
	•	Motive: Protect the faithful from theological confusion or dilution.
	•	Risk: The line between “difference” and “danger” starts to blur.
	•	Example: Strong emphasis on not receiving sacraments outside the Orthodox Church; stricter interpretations of fasting rules.

⸻

3. Suspicion of Contamination
	•	Shift: Belief that heterodoxy or modernity can “infect” Orthodoxy even through indirect contact.
	•	Motive: Guard against compromise.
	•	Risk: Leads to avoidance of dialogue, ecumenical activity, or shared projects.
	•	Example: Refusing to pray in mixed Christian gatherings; condemning any liturgical adaptation as innovation.

⸻

4. Identity as “The Pure Remnant”
	•	Shift: Purity becomes central to identity — being “truly Orthodox” means being more strict and more separate than the average believer.
	•	Motive: Prove loyalty to the faith.
	•	Risk: Zealotry and isolation; seeing mainstream Orthodoxy as already compromised.
	•	Example: Old Calendarist groups separating from their mother church over calendar reforms or perceived laxity.

⸻

5. Doctrinal & Jurisdictional Fragmentation
	•	Shift: Splits occur over increasingly smaller issues — often about how to keep the tradition, not whether to keep it.
	•	Motive: Absolute protection of “true” Orthodoxy.
	•	Risk: Schism over minutiae; rival claims of legitimacy.
	•	Example: Competing bishops and synods in the same city, each claiming to be the sole legitimate shepherd of the faithful.

⸻

6. Self-Perpetuating Rigidity
	•	Shift: The group’s survival depends on maintaining and escalating purity standards.
	•	Motive: Avoid “falling away” like everyone else.
	•	Risk: Disconnection from the wider Church, loss of humility, spiritual pride disguised as piety.
	•	Example: Communities where even saints recognized by the wider Orthodox world are rejected if they were “too lenient” on outsiders.

⸻

Countercurrents in Orthodoxy That Can Break the Spiral
	•	Hesychasm: The inner prayer tradition teaches that humility is the true safeguard, not hyper-vigilance.
	•	Synodality: Councils can restore unity after divisions if there’s willingness to reconcile.
	•	Saintly example: Many saints crossed perceived purity lines in the name of mercy (e.g., St. Maria of Paris serving all in need, regardless of their faith).

Today he was buying his coffee and I sat near the register. He was trying to make eye contact. I looked at him but shyly looked away when we made eye contact. Then I looked again but looked away again when we made eye contact. I think he was trying to give me a smile.

He sat down farer away and I felt more comfortable making eye contact because of the distans. So I looked at him, made eye contact and gave him a warm smile that lingered a little. He looked happy and smiled back. Then I started to read my book again.

I feel that my shyness got in the way and that I screwed up. I am a little shy when it comes to eye contact with strange men and also I am a little cautious because I don’t know them and want to get a feeling of them first (don’t always dare to flirt right or the bat).

Do you men think he understood I was just shy and cautious at first? Or did I screw this up? What impression do you think he got?

My coffee: 
I'm using a dark roast from my local roaster, and from both cupping and V60, I didn't find any harsh taste similar to my espresso, aside from typical roast characteristics. I can confidently say that coffee is not the problem because the same happens with light roast. 

My setup: 
I grind with DF54 into a dosing cup, then into IMS filter basket. I WDT and tamp with a level tamper. I set my temp to 90C. 19g in, 40g out, aiming for 27s. I stir before drinking. 

Possible culprits:
1. Filter basket
I learned from going to coffee events that IMS basket tend to extract more therefore adding bitterness, but I want to avoid switching to VST because it's like 3 times more expensive than IMS here in Korea. 
2. Too long of a ratio?:
I haven't tried pulling a shorter shot. I'll update  on that tomorrow. 
3. Grinder maybe?
I'm not so sure about this one, but DF54 is a budget grinder after all, and it maybe have more fine that it should? 
4. Cleaning: 
No way. I backflush my machine every week, disassemble my grinder to clean every month, and treats my basket well. But perhaps there are more places to clean.
