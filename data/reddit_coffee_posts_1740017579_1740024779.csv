1itprgy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itprgy,Keep finding snail shells in my chamomile…is this normal?,"So I’ve recently ditched coffee in favor of tea. So far I’m loving it - I’m not nearly as anxious and I’ve been significantly more hydrated. Coming from a double espresso shot and several cups of cold brew per day, the caffeine levels are much more manageable between my morning Earl Grey Creme, Scottish Breakfast, and Lapsang Souchong!

I recently ordered a 9oz bag of chamomile from Adagio, and I’ve fished out two shells from the bag so far. Given that I’ve only consumed maybe 2oz of it, I suspect I’ll find more. 

I reached out to Adagio and they apologized but didn’t provide any clarity. 

I’m not grossed out or anything - if anything it makes it seem more natural than the Sleepytime Tea I used to drink. 

That said, is this normal in the tea world?

Thanks!",1,1740024654.0,tea,1,1.0,False
1itpren,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itpren,Why can’t I knock out the coffee powder,I’ve always had a problem with this I use this much dosage because if I use any lesser the coffee will just come out terrible with no crema even though I tamped it properly. Would really appreciate advice on how to deal with this because the current dosage I’m using it’s impossible to knock out the coffee. I must use a spoon to scrape it out (also the setting is set to x2) for some context the coffee beans I used is expired for. A month but even with fresh beans they are like that.

Country : India 
My bf and I we were 15 when we fell romantic connection with each other . 
Not committed but will spent a lot of time together and knew as if we have a connection.  
His guardian and my family were extremely close . Later his guardian sexually assaulted one of my family member for a long period of time and ruined my family . 
So after that we loose all contact for 4.5 yrs . 
All this time I somewhat missed him and had a soft corner for him . Sometimes would think if I loved him or we can never have a future after what his guardian did .
It was confusing yet I miss him.and still deep down will think if he was just putting on an act like his guardian . 


Fast forward he contacted me through social media , we both were 21yr old . Instantly connected . 
I was dumb enough I told him about my past . 
I told him all the things I did bad , good , how that I had an ex and we had sex , all coffee dates I went to and etc . I was just being honest before starting a new relationship. 
He hated it since he said I waited for you and you didn't . ( He said to went to have sex with someone but remember me and returned from  there ) 
Now maybe I implemented the idea to him that I was waiting for him too but it was more like that I was always curious and will think how he is doing . Sometimes will cry thinking about him and other time knew there will not be anything . Confused if it's love or just a connection . 

Now the whole relationship was long distance so things started getting bad . Moreover In the starting months I used to tease him a lot to make him jealous etc . Since I couldn't see his face or his reaction I always felt if he is lying or something .(even if he ever cried  ) He didn't really created the boundaries strongly. As he don't really show a lot of emotions . 
 I once or twice would have compared him to my ex . 
I was immature and should have though about the way I'm telling him things . I told him I'm not guilty for getting physical with my ex but later I apologised . 
So with all the immaturity i had I put on him and then I realised and would stop . Would say utterly fake things twice so he would break up . And told him itd fake right after a min. 
I felt I made him so insecure even about my friends . 
But by the time I stopped he would keep on pressurising me , ask every single detail of all the intimate acts I ever did with anyone . He would ask all this for 5-6 hours a day . 
I can't even remember everything. Sometimes I lie sometimes I'll tell the truth but he would get angry and triggered . He would overthink all day get so angry and say mean things and apologise later . He won't stop asking questions about my ex how I did that etc etc . 
Then he would complain that I lie here or there . It felt I was getting interrogate d every single second of the day
I know I was very toxic from the beginning but he turned into something else. 
He have a fear of abandonment ( childhood trauma with physical voilence and emotional neglect ) . 
He used to have very bad mental and physical health and put all the blame on how I told him things how I took stand for my ex or anyone while he was angry and would say I'll kill them . And all I said was killing someone is wrong . 

He used to be more and more sick over jealous and overthinker . Would say I never prioritize him etc etc .
He would meet me take care of me 
Spend a lot of money on me . 
I would refuse for any expensive gifts but would still accept other things . 
He said he fight with his family for me as they were against us . He left home for me . He couldn't make any career bwcause his mental health ruined because of me. 
Of i told him things , how I compared , how I didn't waited for him in the no contact period . And he consider that I cheated on him in that period.. with many people.

He would always say he will die etc etc and I would say lemme try to repair the relationship etc you will be fine. 
I would encourage him to take therapy but he refused . 
I will encourage him to meet my family and will also break up usually every month I. Starting  because our family won't accept us but he somehow make me believe he will be focused and we will have a beautiful future together 
Or he can't live without me and atleast stay for some more time so he can heal in that time . 

He will hate me for my past. We were in relationship from mid 2023 to jan 2025 .I'll be turning 23 this year . 

He started getting a lot meaner and meaner . Would say he will kill my ex etc . And say extreme mean things on me and my character and would say that he said that in anger and don't remember it as if he is having some sort of split personality disorder. 

I can't understand myself at all . 
I was mean and rude and toxic to him but he was weird . 

He forced me to send him my such pics only bcs in past I did send that to boys I dated and twice traded that for money . I was ashamed but at that time I was thinking that I will help my parents in this way . 
I was crying while sending him those pics and did self harm . All of this happened in call as we were in long distance and met 5-6 times in the whole relationship and would stay 4-5 days together in one meet . 

I was extremely tired of being interrogated everyday . Of being called by means things everyday . I was In bad mental health state and due to I overslept I missed my final exam resulting in delaying of my degree . ( I woke up all night 2 days before that bcs he was sick . Stayed on call ) This is the timeof December 2024 . 

Important 

Now I specifically told him that don't come in between my final exams 
Now this part is triggering for me . 
He always did a lot for me 
Took care of me 
In time of relationship once 
In middle of night in a rain storm he gave me his footwear as mine broke even though he had open wounds on his feet .
Other time he fight with his family for me . 
All this time he would spend a lot onme even when he was  struggling with money . 
He would always come to meet me travelling 1500kms . 
Always stayed by my side . I cried explaing how my parents won't agree but he told me he will convince them etc etc and if they won't be would go etc . 

Before too  I clearly told him that if he can't accept pls leave or accept or punish but not all this bs . His health was declining so I can't leave I'm all these months. 

Main PART
In dec 2024… I had final exams . I told him not to come . 
I missed my exam . I told him relationship problems are fucking my mental health.
.2 days after that he came to my city . I had 6 day holidays in between the next exam .
He was struggling would be sick and act crazy and more aggressive . He is way too sensitive 
Now this part triggers me 
It was evening .
He was getting crazy one day when we were in the room . He gets triggered saying he remembers my ex and what I did . I had to told him things in detail everything months before  bcs of the daily interrogation. He would say my ex send him my pics while in the act which he was lying etc etc . He thinks I always took stand for him I didn't he would just be so angry that I couldnt take his stand . ( I was betrayed and pushed to suicide due to emotional neglect as a teen by my guardian  and his anger would trigger that . I told him this clearly . If he is angry I can't take his stand. ) 
We had sex later it was okay .
Now 
Later he was angry mad and I was uncomfortable. I was lying on the bed and my hand was twisting so I told him to wait 4 times and he wasn't listening . 
He got mad 
I remember this moment . His eyes turned deep red . He said you stopped your ex bcs you were uncomfortable now you are stopping me too . I was in a vulnerable position . He was in front of me . His eyes were deep red . Anger trigger my past trauma. 
He was holding strongly my wrists in front of him . I was so. Scared . I was scared of him , scared he would make a scene . I was crying to which he shouted he will get more angry so I stopped crying . I was teary eyed and had to calm him down . Had to tell him that he can do sex with me . 
I don't remember what happen after this . As much as I do in a minute there was knock on the door. He probably did sex for like a minute or less and then we left the room . 

I had my last final exam tom.. I had to prepare internship report that I couldn't 
And now I spent all night awake preparing internship report and taking care of him as he get so sick and sleepy on the same night as his bp level dropped . I told him to break up but at that moment I couldn't leave him alone in a dark place unknown City and him being in a dead state . 
I hated all of this . 
Awake all night I prepared report, couldn't eat anything until next day evening . 
I wanted to break up he won't 
So he fell guilty etc etc and somehow I brushed everything under the rug . 
We get a little intimate and he went back to his city . But I couldn't stop thinking about this . 

Now I went to my home for winter break in 2025 jan where he would push me with his overthinking and jealousy 
 I would ask him to break up bcs of my family but he would accuse me of cheating . I couldn't stop thinking about that night . 
And In all of jan I was sick .
I was sick for all the year of 2024 but in jan I was more sick . He would push me to talk but I can't bcs I was at home no time and no privacy . Whenever I told him to break up he would get trigger and threaten to kill himself hurt my family call my parents or to kill my ex or to make me a sex slave etc . And would put all the blame of saying all these things on his other personality . That he can't control . 
Things get worse from here .
I came back to my city . 
Since I had cut off with everyone I was able to reach to 2 friends they helped me out with everything. This guy wanted to come to meet me and I had to calm him down so obviously I pretended all love and all even In half of jan ( reported this time period chats to police . . 

After  28 jan them I stopped taking his calls and stop replying to him . I was so scared . I can't touch my phone . His calls were continuously coming 
My friends and I decide to tell my parents so we booked tickets . 
But he came to my city the same day we had train 30 jan 
 
Things escalated I was in no condition to tell anyone anythimg . 
I drank a sip of hair serum and stopped from doing anything more stupid knowing I can't die . Atleast . 
I had mild fever ., extreme digestive issues can't eat or even sleep. For days during the whole process of him getting reported etc.  

End of conversation my family got to know everything , they get involved and I was so anxious scared to death . After 2 weeks my family even get to know I was sexually involved and once he abused me . My parents stopped taking to me for 5-6 days but later supported me and are there for me . I am scared if they ever get to know more of my past . 
I end up reporting him.to police jan 30 ..
I didnt wanted to but had to. 
I press charges with that he threatened to kill himself or me if I break up with him with timeline from mid Jan 2025 to jan 30 . Now there will be a legal case and he can be sent to jail . I don't know what will happen . Chances for settle ment are low . I feel as if I ruined his life .
His younger sister marriage was due in 3-4 months . 
I should have never let him enter in my life again or maybe I should have never teased him compared him told him . I don't know 
Writing all this makes me feel I was toxic but he was pathetic but do he really deserves jail time for all this .

So basically I increased the chances of him serving a jail time . I feel little guilty not very but still . 
 
At this moment I have lost myself .my trauma response is freezw so no help . Moreover um trying to focus on my career again . Afraid my family will know more about my past . 
Trying to get better . 
My extended family don't believe I was panicked would forget things was unable to tell bcs I was super drained and exhausted and even got sexually abused. 

Lemme. Know your thoughts .   
I'm unable to explain things in a more better way",1,1740024563.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

the moment I was able to stand up, in 1 second I remember seeing this distortion in my sight, just like this image: [Vertigo](https://www.houstonent.com/hubfs/blog%20images/vertigo%20houston%20ent%20allergies.jpg)

but immediately my sight returned to normal and I was completely filled with anxiety, I went to the hospital, they did not detect anything, but during the time I was there I felt dizzy, scared and my mouth was dry (I think because of a medicine they injected me) in short a very traumatic night for me.

The next day I really could not tolerate any circular movement of any object, liquid, I felt a great fear.

Movements of liquid like these: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sU9JFUIzfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sU9JFUIzfQ)

I literally couldn’t even stir my coffee or any drink because it scared me. Time has passed, and although the sensation has decreased, I still feel a lot of discomfort. To be more clear, when I see things like this, I feel discomfort, fear, a sense of imbalance, as if I’m going to get dizzy.

This isn’t meant to bury or exonerate her (though i should say i’m firmly of the opinion that some of the criticism of her was over the top). Just felt like writing it all down like this to kind of get a bird’s eye view of of her mistakes

Totals: 

1 quick fire issue, and it involved required component. Lucky her opponent also missed the same component. 
6 elimination challenge issues, 5 of them in a row at the end of the season. 1 instance where required component was missing. Seemed unaware she missed something on 3 of the 6. 
1 issue where indecisiveness hurt a teammate (during Restaurant Wars) 

**Episode 1.** 

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: combine ingredients brought from home with teammates. No issue.

**Elimination:** Challenge: use a specific bird. Wasn’t able to get the sauce she made out onto plates. Still was judged. All required components present. 

**Episode 2:** 

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: short order cook. She was assigned egg and veggie hash. She didn’t get fried egg on every plate. Neither did her opponent. Both were judged still. 

**Elimination:** Challenge: beer and coffee team up. Nothing missing

**Episode 3**

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: dessert. Nothing missing. 

**Elimination:** Challenge: african diaspora. Nothing missing

**Episode 4**

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: dish using a campbell soup. Nothing missing

**Episode 7**

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: second chance at a dish. Nothing missing

**Elimination:** Challenge: hospital workers. Nothing missing

Restaurant Wars. No issue plating her own dish; indecisiveness on what her dish would be likely cost Sarah.

**Episode 9** 

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: cook using old equipment. Nothing missing

**Elimination:** Challenge: write a recipe that a top chef alum also has to cook, Nothing missing

**Episode 10** 

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: chipotle ingredients. Nothing missing

**Elimination:** Challenge: tofu. lost first round. second round cuts herself, gets help to finish plating as a result. but she didn’t get all 10 plates done. Lost because they couldn’t judge her with required element (tofu) missing 

**Episode 11** 

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: black box. Nothing missing 

**Elimination:** Challenge: care package ingredients. Didn’t realize she had left sauce off some of the plates. Still was judged since required elements were there and all judges were served

**Episode 12**  

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: modern oregon trail. nothing missed. 

**Elimination:** Challenge: cheddar five ways. asked for help plating. one of the five cheeses on one plate didn’t make it for one diner. didn’t realize it till judges pointed out. Was judged still. Probably since all the judges were served all required elements. 

**Episode 13** 

**Quick Fire:** Challenge: clams. Nothing missing

**Elimination:** Challenge: hot and cold crab dish. cold dish - nothing missing. hot prep - no potatoes made any of the plates. Judges didn’t realize until she told them at the very end. Still was judged. Seems fair since the required elements were there and the judges loved her dish and didn’t know anything was missing. 

**Episode 14:**  Finale. Did not finish her plates on other first course of the finale meal. Two judges were missing bread and chicharon.Still was judged.  ",1,1740024355.0,BravoTopChef,0,0.67,False

1itpnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1itpnet/how_should_i_go_about_my_interest_in_a_fire/,How should I go about my interest in a fire fighter? (No arson advice pls),"So I (adult female) live in LA and as most of you know, we had wildfires here that devastated the city a few weeks back. Thankfully I was not directly impacted but my heart felt heavy for those who were + the fire fighters who put their lives on the line to keep us safe. So, about 3 weeks ago, I decided to buy a bunch of snacks, waters, Gatorade, sandwiches, and other essentials for the fire fighters in my neighborhood as a way to show my appreciation for all they’d done. When I went to the station to drop it all off, they were so kind and grateful. There were about 5-7 guys that unloaded my car to take the stuff. One of the FF asked if I lived nearby and I told him that I live walking distance, to which he said “well feel free to come by and have coffee or just hang out anytime” which I thought was so kind. 

There was one FF in particular that I thought was cute, and he was fascinated by my car ( I have an old Saturn) and told me that he used to have the same car but in white. We chatted about my car for a bit. Right before I was about to leave the station, the FF I thought was cute said “if you ever plan on selling this car, lmk” and I responded “I’m getting a new car in a few months, so I will” to which he asked“how much will you sell it for?” And I said “I’m not sure yet” to which he responded “well when you know, come back and let me know” and I said “I will!”

I originally didn’t think much of it, but when I relayed the story to my friends, they assured me “that car isn’t the only thing he’s interested in” (which I hope is the case lol) but I don’t want to be creepy and assume he was interested in me. But, I certainly thought he was cute and I’d be interested to see if he’s single and perhaps see if there’s an opportunity to get to know him more. Unfortunately, I didn’t ask any of their names bc there were so many of them lol but I did tell them my name. I also recently found out that this particular fires station has 3 different crews so I’d need to find out which crew he’s on so that I can visit the station when he’s working.

My attraction to him aside, I am someone who loves getting to know new people so getting to know the fire fighters in my neighborhood and participating in the community in that way would be genuinely fun for me. I grew up knowing everyone in my neighborhood so it’d be fun to continue that tradition here. Now, his colleague did say I can come by for coffee whenever but I still feel weird about just showing up. Should I get over the fear and just show up and hang? Should I come for a hang but not come empty handed? (Like maybe I bring baked goods?) I’d like to build a relationship with these fire fighters while also seeing about the one who caught my eye lol. Being that there are 3 crews, maybe I just need to go back on the same day and time as when I dropped off the food? (Assuming they have standing work shifts?)

So if any of you are fire fighters or you know fire fighters, or maybe you don’t but you have any advice you think could be helpful, I’d love to know what that is. Thank you :)",1,1740024286.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1itpkj7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itpkj7,Anyone has tried this LaoBan Zhang PuEr before ?,"Got this during a Yunnan trip at LiJiang area, got a Sheng(raw) and Shou(fermented) cake. 

This is from a small tea shop in a small town that distributes tea as well. Tried a few, red tea followed by PuEr from BingDao(Iceland) & LaoBanZhang of different year. Drank so much tea that my bladder was exploding at end of it. 

I’m mainly a coffee drinker and got this for my son who is more into tea. He is new to PuEr as he is more of a Jap green tea drinker. 

Had been drinking the red tea so far and it had been great as a replacement for my 2nd daily coffee. 

Would like to learn more abt this PuEr before breaking it to drink. Gonna start with the Shou and keep the Sheng for a few more years before drinking. 

Funny thing is when I asked the owner of the tea shop, can I buy and have you shipped it overseas. She told me that she does not have the logistic connection to ship outside of China. ",1,1740024036.0,puer,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1itpk0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1itpk0u/boyfriends_friend_threatening_to_sue_him_for/,Boyfriends friend threatening to sue him for hospital bills,"My boyfriend (20yr) had invited two of his highschool friends (both 20) who he doesn’t see often (thank god) over to hang out. It was a Monday, I work full time 8-5 job and they were over before I got off work. They had been drinking, as those friends cannot have any fun without being intoxicated. They got the alcohol from one of the friend’s fiance (21F). I was pulled out of my room to go hang out - reluctantly due to working all day and having to go back the next day. The night progressed, i had a few drinks and they had much more. They were all obliterated before it hit 8:30. At some point the fiancé and I landed on the topic of politics. She was trying to bond with me over our similar views though this is a conversation i do not have with these friends as our views differ as do our morals. The conversation was just between her and I but eventually my boyfriend and his friend (her fiancé) joined in. Friend #2 had left without saying goodbye to drive himself home before anyone could stop him(yes, while extremely drunk). So the four of us were in our dining area and were on the topic of politics. The fiance who is saying that she agrees with me gets interrupted by the friend/her fiance who says “oh whatever ____ you love the n word. To which she replies “yeah i do hahaha” they then proceed to drop it, he drops it with the hard r, then simultaneously start to pressure me into saying it. I am quite literally backed into a corner. From where we were standing i was in a corner of my dining room my boyfriend at my side blank face steam practically blowing from his ears. I say i have my reasons for not saying the n-word it makes me uncomfortable and i know the history behind that word. Friend goes “so what people havent been whipped im decades”. I say well im Mexican and though my skin is white my family has experienced racism and i mentioned how i have family who are illegal. He goes “im gonna call trump on you”. Right there is where my boyfriend snapped and knocked into him with his forearm knocking him backwards onto our coffee table. His head his the corner and started bleeding. He got up almost right away and my boyfriend told them to get tf out. They drove home. The next day the fiance messaged me asking what happened and why as they were both too drunk to remember what happened. I explained to her thoroughly about what was said to me and that i do not condone the reaction it caused. I got a good apology from her and a half ass one from him. A couple weeks later friend 2 stopped by and said friend 1 was threatening to sue my boyfriend to pay the hospital bills. We are hoping they are empty threats but is this situation something that would hold up in court??Hopefully everything makes sense I tried my best to summarize the whole situation. OR, usa

He insists the solution is that his friends beat him up and poop on him.  This is apparently his goto solution for the situation and his friends are starting to suspect that it's something more...

The diner then get's robbed or something?  Realizing that there was now no way he'd get home on time one of them says ""We need coffee and cigarettes, stat!""  or something very close to that.

I'm also pretty sure it was the last sketch of the episode which tied together a few previous narratives.

1itpdhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HelpMeFind/comments/1itpdhn/im_trying_to_find_a_cliché_love_story_video/,I'm trying to find a cliché love story video,"Hi!

I've been searching for a video that I don't remember the title of, and I that can't seem to find. It was a cliché love story between a normal girl and a rich guy. I believe it was a pretty small budget production, and it was probably chinese. If it wasn't, I'm 100% sure it was at least from an asian team. It had english subtitles.

If you can help me find it, I'd be very grateful! If you can't it's not a big deal, thanks for stopping by and reading my post, I know it's long-



I remember the plot quite well! I might mix up /forget scenes but I'll try to explain everything with as much detail as possible in case someone could recognize it! (Each time I'm not sure about something I'll say it to be safe)

A rich girl finds her lookalike, the main character that I'll call M. The rich girl, the villain of the story, tells M she needs to disappear for some time (I don't remember why) but wants this to go unnoticed. So she offers M a deal : If M pretends to be her for a while and gives her back her place as if nothing happened at the end, she will pay some good money. I believe M accepts because she needs to pay for her grandma's medical bill.

Since M accepts, she takes the villain's place including during her wedding. I'll call the guy B since he's the other main character. We quickly understand that B doesn't like at all the girl M is replacing, he married her only because it was his father (or grandfather)'s wish. He doesn't know she got replaced during most of the story, so as long as I don't explicitly say he understands, consider he doesn't. 



Since he doesn't like her, he's cold and even kinda cruel towards her at first. I'm pretty sure their first scene together is one of them going to bed after the wedding. The next morning, M wakes up alone because B already went to work. The butler gives her an contraceptive pill and she takes it.  
I remember they go to a dinner with B's father/grandather. M has to walk on the way back because he doesn't want to give her a ride. When she does come back home, B's dad/grandfather is there because M forgot her bracelet at his place, he gives it back to her. He wonders why she came back just now, and why B isn't home. M tries to find an explanation but he gets pretty angry, he even gets a heart attack or something.  
When B finds out, he's really mad and blames her for leaving the bracelet. He takes it off during the argument and it breaks, the scene ends with M gathering the pearls while being very sad that it's broken. I'm pretty sure she hurts her knee on the coffee table when the gets down. I'm also pretty sure it was a gift her grandmother gave to her and that's why she's so sad to lose it.

The middle of the video is a bit blurry in my memory but they get closer because M is actually a good person and B realizes she isn't behaving like a spoiled brat as his fiancé did before. He buys her a bracelet at some point as an apology for breaking the one she had before. I also think he brings her on a date. (I remember seeing LOTS of candles). At some point she hurts her ankle in some way, I don't remember how but it's relevant for the end. They clearly fall in love with each other and B becomes a great husband for her.

At some point the villain calls M, and tells her they need to meet. When they do, she gives her an envelope full of cash and tells her to leave with all her stuff, making sure she does leave the wedding ring behind her. M is devastated but needs this money so she does leave early in the morning when B is sleeping. She still has the bracelet with her though. The villain comes back before B wakes up.

But when he does wake up, B is quick to understand something is wrong. For example, he sees the girl isn't wearing the bracelet he bought. She pretends she leaves it in the drawer because the design is obsolete. But B knows ""she"" loved it and always had it on. The ankle injury is relevant at this moment, because when he drops her off somewhere he asks her if she feels better. Here, the villain clearly doesn't really understand why he's mentioning her ankle like this. The villain gets out of the car and goes away pretty quickly so she can avoid further questioning. B grows really suspicious, so he calls the butler because he wants him to make some research.

Things are blurry again, I don't remember how he finds out about M nor what he tells to the villain when he confronts her. But I know he rushes to the airport so he can join M before she gets on her flight back. The last shot is one of them throwing themselves in each other's arms I think.



It's been a few years since I last watched it and I can't find it in my playlists nor in the viewing history nor on the channels I followed back then. I don't really care where the video comes from if anyone finds it, even if it's a repost I'll take it honestly.   
I'm in a nostalgic mood so I'm trying to see it again because it was my favorite at the time, even though I know it's terribly cliché and the actors were probably bad/mid, with surely some copyright-free music in the background.

Thanks in advance! Sorry again for the long post, I REALLY wish i could find this video again and I figured giving as much detail as possible would give me more chances :)",1,1740023391.0,HelpMeFind,1,1.0,False

Not just someone who goes with the flow, but someone I fit with naturally, where the chemistry and dynamic just make sense.

Not to brag but my friends (of < 1 year and of 10+ years) say I'm a good catch, some even say rare catch. Gusto ko lang to ilagay dito to set a standard, but also to give space for me to try and show up *confidently* to a good quality man like you.

**I don't know how to sell myself, so I'll just list things that best describe me:**

* Detail-oriented & analytical, but I'm chill.
* Messy organized-type
* Genuine & prefers genuine connection
* Good at effective communication / listening / understanding
* Highly appreciate call outs if worded properly
* Passionate about personal growth & self-work
* Highly self-aware & empathic.
* Emotionally intelligent & emotionally mature, but sometimes still immature (i.e., stubbornness, voluntary age regression)
* I’ve found my life’s purpose, and learning new perspectives helps me navigate my journey.
* I love deep, thought-provoking conversations and even have card games for it if you want.
* More comfortable speaking in Taglish.
* Picky eater, grew up with (and still get) princess treatment
* Agnostic & apolitical. I’m ok talking about faith & spirituality, but not politics.

**Hobbies:**

* Tarot reading (always)
* YouTube/Netflix (most times)
* Gaming (most times), would love to play controller-friendly co-op games with you on PC!
* Reading a book (rare)

**What I'm looking for?**

* Someone who’s also looking to settle down and get married within the next 3-5 years. (**deal breaker**)
* Someone with class and isn't crass
* Has own car (**deal breaker**)
* Can hatid/sundo. I'm a new driver and a homebody + don't have own car, so while I do have the license, I don't have the car or the experience to do the same 😅
* Be taller than me, but not too tall. Maybe between 5'7 to 5'11.
* Dog/cat lover, but I'm scared of cats and due to eczema, I can't be around too much fur/dust.
* Someone who does not have an issue with making time for me
* Someone who has achieved work-life balance (**deal breaker**)
* NOT a people pleaser
* Someone who has a lean body type (aka slim) and has some fitness activity (**deal breaker**)

And then… nothing.

Two hours passed before the dreaded announcement: Mechanical issues. Everyone off the plane.

The whole plane groaned. My kids were exhausted. My wife was cranky. I had a webinar the next day and just wanted to be home.

At first, I was frustrated. Then I remembered the Burnt Toast Theory—the idea that small inconveniences (like burnt toast or a last-minute delay) might actually be protecting us from something worse.

I once read a post about someone whose flight got canceled, and they were furious—until they later realized that delay might’ve saved them from disaster.

That hits different when you’re actually living it.

It made me wonder… how often do we complain about setbacks when they might actually be redirections?

Instead of being mad, I chose to be grateful. That delay gave us an extra day in LA. We hit the beach, I found a great coffee shop to work from, and everything worked out.

If I don’t drink in the afternoons my stomach hurts. My everyday diet was (morning: Diet Coke or coffee. lunch: anything I craved or homemade food. afternoon: no food only 6 beers minimum.)

I didn’t go to the er until the next day and got 9 staples. You would think I’d stop drinking. I didn’t and my stomach problems came back.

I recently purchased a moka pot in an attempt to stop spending so much money at coffee shops.

I fill the bottom with boiling water just until it reaches the safety valve, put a good amount of grounds into the funnel filter, and I tap the sides but I don’t tamp it. I put it on a very low heat and let it sit. Everybody is saying that it should only take a few minutes for the extraction to start, but I kid you not, it took 25 minutes for anything to start coming out. After it finally did, I immediately ran the pot under cold water to stop it from brewing any further, but unfortunately cold water could not salvage it. It’s super burnt and bitter. I’m wondering what I’m doing wrong? This is my fourth attempt and the extraction takes forever and just ends up giving me undrinkable coffee.

1itp2x8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itp2x8,Episode Daan Taipei-Globalist review,"Globalist review of this newish addition to the Hyatt portfolio in Taipei. 

Just checked out of a three night stay at the Episode. My last JDV stay was in the Hotel Vitale back in 2007 in SF so was interested to see this option in Taipei. (and those of us long time Taipei travellers, either ourselves or partners, know the issues with the haunted GH). So first off glad for a new option before the PH opens.

This hotel is hip and smallish.  Lobby is on the 5th floor. The location is very central and I was very happy with it. So you arrive and go upstairs to check in. A bit odd, someone helps you scan your passport and gives you a tiny unitemized receipt for the deposit. 

I booked the least expensive King room, and was proactively upgraded to a killer suite. It was also located on the 5th floor. 

See pics attached.

Full living room, bedroom, large bath with tub and shower. Double sinks.

There is a happy hour in the lobby area with free beer and wine for *all guests*. It ends at 6:30pm. Globalists get a voucher that entitles us to beer and wine and upgraded drinks from the bar, gratis, until 9pm.  Some snack options too like a cheese plate etc in addition to the nuts available to all guests. It's fine - but don't get excited.  It's not a Regency Club.

Breakfast is wild. On the first floor is a Texas Roadhouse and that's where breakfast is. You basically get an option of bacon/sausage, eggs and tater tots.  Though you can swap the tater tots for yogurt. Coffee, OJ and water are available and included. Can't ask for seconds. 

Gym wise it's minmal. Two treadmills, a bike, two benches, dumbbells up to 25k and a cable rack. You can get a decent workout. Daan park is 10 mins away so if you want to run/walk suggest you go there instead. 

If you are an early riser, breakfast doesn't start until 7:30. This was a bit irritating for me so I would go get coffee at 7/11 or Family Mart earlier. 

All in all I would stay here again. The location is great and my wife won't set foot in the GH. They do the best they can for Globalists and I felt appreciated. Just don't expect a Grand Hyatt.

Hello!

I recently had an ice cream craving and bought these Talentis. They are quite tasty, if not scrumptious and I thought I'd write a review to share my love for these delectable frozen treats.

  


**Talenti Gelato - Coffee Chocolate Chip (7.2/10)**

I had a random spur of a coffee ice cream craving and I watched a couple videos on ice cream (quite research savvy, I know) and I decided to get the Talenti Coffee Chocolate Chip.

I think the best way I can describe it is to imagine Costco when they had their 2014(?) iced coffee\* with actual ice cubes with starbuck's java chips as the consolatory -chocolate chip part of the gelato.

*\*I'm actually not sure that was a thing because when I google it I can't see old menu pictures with their old iced coffee, but I swear it was a real thing, but source misinformation is a real thing...If I remember right though it tastes the same as their current cold brew slushie, except with cubes instead of its slush formation.*

I thought it was good and not too sweet, but I think next time if I want a coffee ice cream, where I prefer coffee as an accent flavor I would repurchase my usual Hagendaaz Coffee Toffee Bars. Those are delicious and salty-sweet!



**Talenti Diary-Free Sorbetto - Roman Raspberry (9.8/10)**

This flavor is dangerously addictive...At least in my opinion. I really like fresh raspberries and tart sorbets and yogurts so I was curious to try out the fabled Roman Raspberry. It was divine once I popped off the lid after an hour of thawing it both physically and mentally. Hard work really does make sorbet tastes better.

Unfortunately it wasn't as tart as I'd expected, but then again I used to eat sour skittles anticipating the citric burn of pure sourness, so maybe I'm not a reliable source.

Maybe this sounds like a talenti Kirkland conspiracy, but when I gave it to another family member to sample its deliciousness my brother remarked that it tasted a lot like Costco's old Mixed Berry Smoothie with a striking color similarity to my raspberry sorbet. I thought, ""that is very true!"" I think it is quite a delectable flavor and had I had my own restraint I probably could have gobbled it up as an after dinner dessert in a singular sitting.

If you maybe wanted to gamble with your chances and try a tarter sorbet-y experience I'd recommend this combo at Yogurtland: Pistachio, Taro, Mango, Mango+Strawberry, Strawberry, Passion Orange Guava Tart with Mango popping boba. A crazy colorful combo but the Guava is quite tart and delicious balanced with the rest of the rainbow yogurt flavors. Or you could eat a real raspberry. Perhaps.



**Final Thoughts**

I think $5.48 (according to Walmart prices) is quite steep for a singular pint of Gelato...but I think all of us deserve the right to indulge in sweet sin. I wouldn't spend my money on the Coffee Chocolate Chip again, but I would for the Roman Raspberry. I think one of the main cons is the price and in a sense the container. I think it's really cool that I could have a constant reminder of my frozen treat consumption as the jar is reusable, but it is also really hard to open (noted by other Reddit posts). To paint a dramatic picture, imagine being an MMA fighter and having someone in a chokehold for several minutes, however, in this case it is your newly bought Talentis. At first the chokehold is difficult to grasp upon entering into the process, however, as you try and try it's really hard to keep your opponent (the talenti jar) at bay because they are quite vicious and do not want to lose. Eventually the seven minutes allows you to remain victorious, but at what cost, because in the real world an hour has passed after you attempted to thaw your talenti open with warm water, a knife, a bottle opener, and telekinesis. Your jar is open and unsealed now but the gelato (or sorbet) is no longer the ideal freezer cold, but slightly melted. Maybe I'm one for theatrics for comparing Talenti jar opening to a battle for victory, but that's what it felt like because the victory was quite delicious.

Also I want to try sampling more ice cream flavors. Has anyone tried Huckleberry? Is it sour?",1,1740022403.0,icecream,0,1.0,False

Lena sat curled on her couch, wrapped in a blanket, rain tapping against the windows in a rhythmic, numbing pattern. She barely noticed it at first—just a soft *thud* at the front door. Probably the wind.



Then, three deliberate knocks. **Knock. Knock. Knock.**



She muted the movie she was watching, her pulse quickening. The house was secluded, miles from the nearest neighbor. No one should be here.



She crept to the door, pressing her eye against the peephole. **Nothing.**



Another knock, harder this time. She swallowed, fingers trembling as she flicked on the porch light. The rain distorted the view through the glass, but the porch was empty.



Lena stepped back. Her skin prickled.

Then came the creak.



Not from the front door. From the *back.*



She spun, heart hammering, every shadow stretching too long in the dim light. The old farmhouse groaned with the storm, but this sound was different—slow, intentional.



Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. A message from an **unknown number**.



*Why are you hiding?*

*I can see you.*



A gasp caught in her throat. She turned off the living room lamp in one frantic motion, plunging the house into darkness. The rain pounded harder now, wind howling through the trees outside.



Another message.



*You’re going to blink soon.*



A new sound filled the house—something like a wet breath, low and guttural, just behind her.



Lena spun, eyes darting to every corner. **Nothing.**



Her reflection in the dark TV screen stared back, eyes wide with terror. But then—her breath hitched—**the reflection didn’t match her movements.**



Her reflection blinked.



She didn’t.



Lena clapped a hand over her mouth, stifling a scream as her own distorted image in the screen *grinned*.

1itoyv9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itoyv9,Chocolate peanut butter bites,"Folks, as promised from yesterday I have tried a slightly different and lower calorie version of the choc. PB truffle bites. This time used an ice tray just to make the molds. And I TRIED to make it look aesthetically pleasing and not like turd balls. Thanks 

1. For the chocolate coating I mixed Hershey zero sugar syrup, sweet zero cal syrup, cocoa powder, and half a PB Gatsby bar. 
2. Layered the chocolate at the bottom of the tray after spraying it will a little oil. Freeze. 
3. Inside is just PB2 and apple sauce. (Last time I added almond flour for texture, but I took this out to save calories). Turned out just fine 
4. Layer PB on top of chocolate. Freeze a bit. 
5. Finally plop final thin layer of remaining “chocolate” on molds and freeze for at least 3 hours. 

Pop them out and store them in the FREEZER or else they will soften into mush. 

Taste: I am on a cut so I cannot afford to just use plain melted chocolate so I had to create an absolute abomination of processed chemicals 😭😂 so this DOES have an artificial taste on the outside but I don’t mind. If you can spare the calories this would be bomb with some simple chocolate 

The PB filling is great with apple sauce, nice thick texture. 

Overall about 57 cals per bite. Very satisfying for ME 
Enjoy

1itoyk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1itoyk7/what_are_his_intentions_or_am_i_overthinking/,What are his intentions? Or am I overthinking?,"Hi everyone, I have a question or two that have been in my mind for a while since coming back from a NY trip. I visited a friend of mine that I have known for about 6 years since college (he and I met prior to transferring to our school). Since undergraduate, he moved to NYC with a now ex girlfriend and I've been broken up with my ex for almost 4 years now. Prior to this, in college, we also casually saw one another. If I am being fully honest, I have had a crush on him since meeting him but after he dated his ex I chose not to say anything because it's inappropriate. Fast forward to this past Friday, I flew to NY for the third time and saw him (we had seen each other last year in April)---what kinda makes this trip a bit different is that I had asked him what his feelings were towards me on NYE, but he was working that night and I said to forget about it. He had said to me that he respected my boundaries after I also brought to his attention that we didn't fully know one another unless we were in room having sex. I then consented to seeing him casually.

Going back to this past weekend, I was shocked at how hospitable he was with me since in college he wouldn't really try to hang out to get coffee as friends or wouldn't say hi in public settings. In this trip, I met someone completely new. Not only did he take me around the city, which I appreciated since I want to move there, but after a bar crawl we did (since it's his job it was actually fun seeing him do his bits and make people laugh) we were heading home for the night in which he was looking at something on his phone and he kissed me on the lips in public. Mind you, I have liked him since we were Sophomores so I was FEELING IT along with the alcohol! Prior to flying out, we were talking about bit more than usual and he was also flirting with me which he acknowledged doing so because he wanted to. On Sunday, I made a comment along the lines of, ""well, I have my make-up on. I'm not ugly now"" to which he said, ""you're not ugly. You're pretty"". I think I said that he says that to all the girls, but he responded ""I find you attractive. If I didn't, we wouldn't be sleeping with either"" which I get where it sounds crude, but because he and I have been honest and casual with one another I wasn't offended by the last part.

On my last day, before he left, we hugged and said the usual ""see you soon"". Before he left, he kissed me on the forehead and on the lips. I become a school girl when he does things like this and he knows that. I would ask him directly but I don't want a repeat of the NYE message. What are his intentions at this point? He and I are around the same age, both support our distinct career choices and there's chemistry between us.",1,1740022033.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

for example:

1) An AI powered service to practice for difficult conversations/situations that don't come up very often. Like practicing for an interview, firing someone at work, breaking up with a girlfriend, negotiating for a car, asking a girl out, etc. For some people I imagine this could be really helpful since oftentimes conversations are difficult simply because we rarely need to do them. Using an AI powered virtual person at the other end of a video call, this service would allow you to practice for any situation in a realistic way with an 'agent' at the other end who can dynamically adjust and respond to you. 

2) Crowd sourced dark roast coffee finder map - as a dark roast coffee lover I've often found it difficult while traveling to find a decent cup. It would be great to have a crowd sourced map of great coffee shops around the world with dark roast coffee.

3) Food calorie analyzer - to help me lose weight, I would love to just be able to take a picture of a dish I ate, and the AI system could estimate the # of calories and macros in the dish automatically. Apps like myfitnesspal require you to figure it out on your own which is hard especially with restaurant food or ethnic/foreign food. 

OK #2 isn't really a business, more of a fun tool. But I suspect there could be a decent market for #1 and #3. Should I just create a landing page using carrd for example with a mailing list to see if people sign up? How do I generate some awareness of it? Facebook ads or something?

I figure if I can prove some initial interest and maybe even pre-sales, a technical co founder could then come on board and I can focus on the selling and fundraising aspects. I don't want to put the cart ahead of the horse. Maybe all of these ideas are trash and no one would pay for them - better to find that out early.",1,1740022021.0,Entrepreneur,2,1.0,False

1itov10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1itov10/what_does_an_evening_look_like_for_you_your/,What does an evening look like for you + your partner?,"I need to know if I’m crazy or not. I love my partner dearly. We’ve been together going on 6 years, but lately I feel like we’re closer to roommates than partners. I feel like our daily/evening routine is lacking, and our relationship is suffering because of it. I’d love to hear what other people with partners typically do in the evenings to see if I need to manage my expectations. Our work schedules mean we only get a few hours together every day before one or both of us needs to crash, and while I don’t expect grand plans daily.. I just feel like other people do more stuff? Is this just the reality of the American work schedule where we get up at 6, get home at 6, eat, sleep, wash, rinse, repeat? 


A typical day for us is getting ready for work in the morning separately- we each wake up at different times every day thanks to weird work schedules and they never align so there’s no morning coffee or saying goodbye before work. By the time I get home he’s usually been home for a couple hours and is playing video games. Sometimes he greets me, sometimes he doesn’t. I usually take my cue from him because I don’t know if he’s on coms with others or in a part that needs concentration, so I don’t greet him immediately unless he greets me.


Then, depending on the time, I start on dinner or ask if he’s hungry yet once he’s obviously paused his game or removed his headphones. It’s something that I feel good at and makes me feel good to do for him. I usually have a meal plan posted on the fridge for the week so if I’m running especially late he can start gathering ingredients or knock out the first step or two. To me, making dinner and eating together is important and I’ve expressed this. I’ve settled for eating at the same time at our separate tables. I grew up in a family dinner household, but he did not and even after 6 years it’s clear he still doesn’t  personally *feel* the importance of family dinner- even if that family is only 2 people. Sometimes his “snack” while he’s waiting on me is big, and he’s not hungry for dinner- which definitely bums me out. 


We don’t sit at the table or couch together. Our computer desks are in the great room (kitchen/dining/living combo) and he usually goes to sit at his desk to eat. And there he stays the rest of the evening. He’s not being antisocial, we’ll chat. But it’s usually about whatever is going on on the screen- YouTube video, tv show, etc. Usually we do separate things. Occasionally we’ll play a multiplayer game or watch a tv show together. But our life pretty much revolves around a screen in the evening. We never go out or do anything beyond this on a weeknight. Rarely we’ll go out on weekends but to me it’s not a “date” unless is pre-planned. Going out and running errands or eating out because we don’t feel like cooking isn’t a date to me. I just feel like the only thing making us anything beyond roommates is the fact that we share a bed. 


Am I crazy to think that we should be doing something more? I don’t really know what exactly, but this feels… underwhelming. The thought of living the next 50+ years like this makes me scream internally.

Trump has styled himself a boss. And the indiscriminate firings and other brazen behavior mimic union busting efforts that are known and have been matched and bested time and again.

The people are our union. They may not know it. They may not have yet chosen to sign on. But all among them share in our plight and we in theirs. For those of us most certain and most prepared to do 'something,' we go where the ask is most difficult. We search for moments of confusion or anger and we press these people to see a solution in us, in our people's union.

We turn the lights on, one soul at a time. We invest in these relationships, take deep interest in these people, we listen to them, comfort them, believe in them, and we stoke their passions for reason and justice until they take that quiet moment to choose to rise up.

This image goes way back. I discovered it reading ""No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power"" by McAlevey. Become collectors of tools and past lessons as you grow your networks and make your plans. This is officially a marathon now. And the powers are poised to break our spirit if they can. They cannot. We know what America is supposed to be. That's not something you just forget when a bad guy tells you to. And the promise of the American Dream will haunt us every day we can no longer take it for granted. We are bound to it and so we are bound to each other. That's why we go to work.

My goal with this is to not force what Kendu is down your throat, I want you to form your own opinion and let this serve as an introduction.

Okay, moving on to the title. Recently, we have seen relentless rugging on the Solana blockchain where public figures are extracting millions upon millions of liquidity out of memecoin traders/investors. The recent Libra rug which was done by the OFFICIAL government of Argentina reached billions of volume meaning these billions were essentially stolen from us. Even today, Dave Portnoy launched a coin called $GREED and rugged it after explicitly saying he wouldn't sell. I could go on forever but as I said, I want this post to be short.

My point is though, if you are buying memecoins lately chances are you've been incredibly rekt and lost a lot of money. Personally I have gone through many public forums such as telegram lounges, crypto twitter etc and seen a lot of people fairly upset about this and there seemingly being no light at the end of the tunnel. This will eventually lead to a mass exodus of the memecoin space leaving very little liquidity behind meaning all real projects will suffer.

This made me think... the people obviously need a saviour, but this saviour may not be in the form you might expect. Many people expect someone like Murad to come forth and lead them to salvation, which in my opinion just simply is not possible. But what if I told you that your saviour can come in the form of a huge group of people lifting each other up?

Welcome to Kendu, your saviour is here. We are completely organic without any paid marketing, artificial candles on the chart and simply no bullshit. Our community members come from all around the globe and have joined forces to create this movement. Some members have already made their mark on the world through their own initiatives such as a Kendu branded energy drink, Kendu coffee, leaving stickers in public areas, making unhinged irl shilling videos and so much more.

This is the saviour DeFi needs. Real people with good intentions pushing a movement.

And with that I invite you to discover more about us as I stated at the top of the post.

She sees me and smiles—young, bright-eyed, curious and hopeful.

“So, which med school did we get into?” she asks, stirring sugar into her coffee.

I smile. “That’s not the important part.”

She frowns. “Then what is?”

“We made it,” I whisper. “In a few months, we’ll be a licensed doctor.”

Her lips part, eyes filling with relief. She lets out a shaky breath. “I knew it,” she whispers. “I knew we could do it.”

Then, her gaze drops to my left hand—bare. No engagement ring. No wedding band.

Her face falls. “Where is he?” she asks, voice quiet, almost afraid.

I inhale deeply. “We didn’t marry him.”

Silence.

Her fingers tighten around her coffee cup. “Why not?”

I meet her eyes—the same ones that once believed in forever. “Because love isn’t just about holding on,” I say gently. “Sometimes, it’s about knowing when to let go. And we… we held on too long.”

Her expression crumbles. I can almost hear her heart breaking, because I remember how it felt.

“But we were happy,” she whispers.

I nod. “Yes, we were. Until we weren’t.”

She looks away, blinking fast, trying to be strong. I want to reach across the table, tell her that the nights she’ll cry alone won’t be for nothing. That she will survive. That she will rebuild herself from the pieces he left behind.

“Are we… happy now?” she finally asks, hesitant.

I smile, but it’s not the kind she knows. It’s quieter. Wiser. “We’re healing.”

She nods slowly, letting the words settle. Then, with a deep breath, she asks the question that matters most.

“And our family?”

I exhale, my chest aching. “They’re still here. They always have been.”

Tears slip down her cheeks, but this time, they’re not from sadness. They’re from gratitude.

She reaches across the table, her smaller hand grasping mine. “You’re strong.”

I squeeze back. “So are you.”

She hesitates as she stands to leave, then turns to me, one last time. “Do we ever fall in love again?”

I meet the girl who loved with her whole heart, who believed in soulmates, who thought love was a single story.

And I tell her the truth.

“I don’t know yet. But this time, we’ll choose ourselves first.”

She smiles, her eyes shining. “Good. That’s all I ever wanted for us.”

And just like that, she walks away, back into the past.

And I sit there, watching her go, knowing that every step she takes—every joy, every heartbreak, every tear—leads her straight to me.",17,1740020869.0,selflove,3,1.0,False

Couldn't go more than five minutes without hacking so hard i would gag, and occasionally tear my esophagus and cough blood. Always a bunch of mucus in the throat i need to clear and cough up. 

Critical Mistake:

I replaced alcohol and coffee with peppermint tea. I was drinking upwards of 6 cups a day. Peppermint and other mints relax your lower esoph and this put me in a terrible terrible fit. Had no clue I was poisoning myself lol. 

Diet changes:

Absolutely no coffee or red wine
Beer is not great. Whiskey is ok. 
No pickled stuff when flared up. 
Nor onions or garlic. 
No eating within several hours of bed. 
Dropped fried eggs and the like for IBS friendly smoothies in the morn. 

Meds and supplements:
Omep and plutonix. It seems like they kinda helped but it wasnt noticeable. 
I take that beet pill that *increases* stomach before meals and it may have helped but i started it around the time i started the licorice and that was much more tangibly helping.
Alkaline water kinda helps while youre drinking it. 
Sucking on a tums kinda helps but the sugar would just piss it back off. 

Magical cure:

Licorice root tea. Literally the only thing that lets me not cough. I dont understand what its doing but it works. Ultimately coughing hurts the throat and clears the mucus so the throat makes more mucus and then you cough more. You have to somehow break that cycle so your throat can heal. I would drink the licorice and still feel the need to cough but i could ignore it and cough less and less until now, where my throat is mostly healed and now i only need to clear my throat a couple of times a day. 

Random note:
Propping my back up in the night would drain a bunch of mucus in my lungs and i would wake up in terrible coughing fits and burning lungs.

Started with dizziness, nose, throat, all that stuff couple of months ago. 

Started PPI but continued bad diet including smoking, alcohol, coffee, bad food, the works. 

After a couple months of troubleshooting figured it out with the doc it is LPR. 

Diet is strict, no coffee, no alcohol, quit smoking, all the recommended foods, probiotics, sleeping 45 degrees, the works. 

My vertigo is almost gone, still getting some throat issues here and there but improving everyday. 

I would really like to stop the PPI. What's everyones experience with this? Online I'm getting mixed opinions. Even the two months I've taken 40mg Omeprazole daily has made me nervous about kidney damage and kidney stones etc. I'm fairly set on this. 

And alcohol, I imagine that's the worst for LPR. But has anyone managed to partake in a weekly drink or two without adverse effects? Any tips?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

A close friend recently married someone whose family is from UP who was expected to make elaborate meals multiple times of the day while visiting the in laws. Another coworker who is also from the North who has been married for a decade, living with the in laws, said something very disturbing. ""The bathroom is the only place of peace and quiet, my in laws make me cook samosas and kachoris every weekend despite my work schedule, we can't order anything from outside.""

When I went to a hill station in Tamil Nadu last year on a holiday, I observed it was fairly similar to the earlier incidents minus the elaborate dishes. The women were expected to constantly keep making filter coffee several times in the day, make dishes to suit the needs of all those who reside in the house(ranging from a toddler all the way to 80 year olds) and nothing less than delicious is tolerated.

I am baffled at how educated women are still cooking so many dishes and at an alarming high frequency throughout the day/week. Please forgive my ignorance but I am from a Tier 1 city/metro from the South, so even when I was a child, the maximum my mother and my friend's mothers made outside of breakfast, lunch and dinner(all of these meals were simple nothing extravagant) were some home made snacks on festival days and now in 2025 there is hardly anyone I know in my circle who spends several hours in the kitchen. Anything outside the basics, they hire a cook or buy the items from the store. I was expecting that things would change outside of where I stayed but clearly nothing has changed.

I love to cook and I do it often but never for several hours of the day and it is never expected of me to cook elaborate dishes. I make whatever I want to feed myself and that's it. If friends or family are visiting I make something nice for all of us to enjoy. 

On the other hand, I see women are cooking elaborate breakfast, lunch, dinner, chai throughout the day and homemade snacks for their men and added to this frequent prep for random pujas, karwa chauth etc and a lot of this is done against their will. It is just expected that the women will make all this food prep happen. Is nobody here getting tired of being in the kitchen all day and slaving over a stove?! What happens if you say no? Does anyone see it the way I see it, which is **keeping you in the kitchen for as long as possible will keep you out of important matters like hobbies, friendships,travel, career growth, how to handle money, etc**

1ito9hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1ito9hs/one_year_later_with_my_bumble_match/,One Year Later with my Bumble Match,"About a year ago I (43m) paid for a few months of Bumble just to see what was out there. I had a couple of matches, and a couple meet-ups but nothing special. 


Then a new match came in. We chatted a bit about a mutual interest and I asked her (47f) out for coffee. It turned out we had way more in common than we thought and conversation was easy and fluid. We exchanged numbers and began texting for the next week or so. 


With a second date approaching, I had resolved that even if she decided she wasn’t  romantically inclined towards me, I’d be happy to be friends because I honestly had never met someone who shared as many interests, even things from our childhoods. And we got along exceedingly well. 


It turned out that resolution wasn’t necessary because the second date ended with a kiss. 


Last weekend we exchanged anniversary gifts and began planning our third little trip together. It’s been so fun and exciting. I’m thrilled for more of the same. We love and support each other and I am so grateful to have found her and happy she is part of my life. 


So Bumble worked for us. It can be rough out there but don’t lose hope with OLD. 


If I could give advice, especially to the guys out there, it’s this:


- You’re there to date, so ask them out! Chatting is great but get to the point, with all deliberate speed. 


- Your personality should come through your profile. Don’t laundry list or info dump. Don’t just show “a” sense of humor, show yours!


- Someone who is interested in you will SHOW it. Don’t invest in anyone who doesn’t. ",41,1740019877.0,Bumble,4,0.89,False

Shoutout to the beautiful and innovative mind behind it—because if you’ve ever struggled with dry climate skin, you know how real the struggle is! 

I travel to Arizona frequently (40F), and coming from the humid Northeast, the desert air used to leave me looking like a shriveled prune. After consulting with my cosmetic dermatologist, I developed a routine that actually works. If you’re battling dryness, here’s what I swear by:

Lock in Moisture Immediately Post-Shower
Before your skin dries, while you still have water droplets on you, apply a petroleum-based lotion to trap moisture in your skin barrier. My go-to is Gold Bond Healing Lotion.

Double Up on Occlusives
To reinforce hydration, I add a layer of Vaseline over my body lotion. This step prevents transepidermal water loss throughout the day and night. 

Hydrating & Barrier-Protecting Skincare Routine
Hydrating peptide serum (Timeless Matrixyl Synthe 6)

Barrier protection:
- Night: CeraVe Healing Ointment (I go to bed looking like a glazed donut). If I wake up in the middle of the night, I will reapply more. The trick is to stay greasy! 
- Day: La Roche-Posay Cicaplast (keeps my skin protected without being greasy during the day).
- Antioxidant support: Timeless Vitamin C Serum
- Moisturizer - LRP Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer and LRP Lipikar Daily Repair Moisturizing Cream
- Always apply to face and neck! 

Hydration & Diet Matter

- Water, water, and more water! I also add coconut water and herbal teas for extra hydration.
- I limit caffeine and swap coffee for green tea to prevent dehydration.
- Water-rich foods (cucumbers, watermelon, oranges) and omega-3s (salmon, chia seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts) help keep my skin plump. I add the Nordic Naturals Omega 3 supplement. Good skincare comes from the inside out. 

Use a Humidifier - it’s a lifesaver. Pink bacteria grows rapid in these machines so make sure you clean it out once a week.

The Obvious But Necessary Step: Sunscreen!
SPF 50+ every single day, reapply religiously, and don’t forget a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. I like the Beauty of Joseon Matte Sun Stick for my face and neck. 

Bonus Anti-Aging Tips for Dry Climates

- Retinoids with caution: Scale back on tretinoin/retinol in the desert, as they can intensify dryness.
- Hyaluronic Acid 101: Always apply to damp skin, not dry, or it can pull moisture out instead of in.
- Hot showers = NOPE: They strip your skin’s natural oils. Also, I only use cleanser at night—in the morning, I just rinse with water. I use BioDerma Micellar Water and La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser. 
- Silk pillowcases: Less friction = fewer sleep wrinkles.
- DIY facial mist: Avene/Evian thermal sprays are great, but you can also make your own with distilled water + glycerin in a spray bottle. I can keep this in my purse. 

Final Thought:
Embrace the grease. Walk around looking like a dewy goblin, chugging water like it’s your full-time job. Your skin will thank you.

Chapter 1: A City of Dreams and Nightmares

     In the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, where the Blue Ridge Mountains cradle the town, the air was thick with the scent of coffee and freshly baked pastries. It was a city that lured many with its artistic spirit, vibrant music scene, and lush landscapes. For Sarah Mitchell, it had been a refuge—a place to escape the hardships of her past. But as she sipped her morning brew at the local café, a heavy weight settled in her chest.

     Sarah worked as a receptionist at a bustling law firm downtown, earning a mere $14.50 an hour. Despite her best efforts to budget, each month felt like a Herculean struggle to make rent for her tiny, one bedroom apartment in West Asheville. “It’s all about the experience,” her friends told her, but they weren’t the ones struggling to keep the lights on.

    Each day, Sarah watched as the cost of living crept higher, squeezing her and countless others in the city. Her apartment, once affordable, now felt like a luxury—a sentiment echoed by her coworkers, who were also feeling the pinch of soaring rent prices.

Chapter 2: The Cost of Living

    As she walked to work, Sarah passed the many “For Rent” signs plastered across lawns, often accompanied by heart wrenching “We’re moving” flyers from her neighbors. Each sign felt like a blow to her heart, a reminder of the precarious situation many found themselves in. The owners of these properties, driven by greed and the allure of profit, had jacked up the prices. It felt as though the city she loved was turning against its residents.
    
    After another exhausting day at the law firm, Sarah returned home to find an eviction notice taped to her door. Panic coursed through her veins as she read the bold letters: “Rent increase effective immediately.” She had already stretched her budget to the limit; there was no room for more. As tears blurred her vision, she thought of the homeless encampments that had begun to populate the edges of downtown, each one a reminder of the harsh reality facing so many.

Chapter 3: A Community in Crisis

   That evening, Sarah joined a local meeting organized by the Asheville Tenants Union. The room was filled with weary faces, each person sharing their own horror stories. As the discussion unfolded, a theme emerged: greedy landlords and real estate agents had created an environment where basic shelter was now a privilege.
“They don’t care about us,” one woman exclaimed. “They only see dollar signs!”
Sarah felt a surge of solidarity in the room. She began to understand that her struggle was not hers alone. The group shared resources, and Sarah found comfort in their camaraderie. They began strategizing ways to pressure landlords to stabilize rents and advocate for affordable housing initiatives.

Chapter 4: The Fight for Change

    With newfound determination, Sarah became an active member of the union. She collaborated with her neighbors, organized rallies, and advocated for a rent control policy that would protect vulnerable residents from the greed of landlords. The movement began to gain momentum, attracting attention from local media. They shared stories of how the rising cost of living was not just a number—it represented families being displaced, people losing their homes, and dreams being shattered.

    As the momentum grew, so did the backlash from real estate agents and landlords who felt threatened by the union’s efforts. The battle lines were drawn, but Sarah was undeterred. She had a vision of a more equitable Asheville—one where the beauty of the mountains was accessible to all, not just those who could afford exorbitant rents.

Chapter 5: The Turning Tide

    Weeks turned into months, and despite the setbacks, the movement sparked change. Local politicians began taking notice, and discussions around affordable housing policies began to surface. Sarah felt hope blooming in her heart—a feeling she hadn’t experienced in a long time. Perhaps her voice, along with those of her neighbors, could make a difference.

   Then came the fateful day when the city council convened to discuss rent control measures. As Sarah stood outside the building, flanked by her friends and allies, she felt a rush of adrenaline. She was fighting not just for her own survival, but for everyone who had been pushed to the margins.

Chapter 6: A New Beginning

    Months later, the city passed new legislation to regulate rent increases, marking a significant victory for the Asheville Tenants Union. The fight was far from over, but Sarah felt a renewed sense of purpose. She understood that real change takes time, but with solidarity and perseverance, they could reshape their community.

     As she walked through the streets of Asheville, now buzzing with the vibrant life of its residents, Sarah found herself reflecting on her journey. The mountains loomed in the distance, a reminder of the beauty that could coexist with the struggles of daily life. She had discovered not just a fight for rent control, but a deeper connection to her community.",2,1740019313.0,asheville,2,0.67,False

I love her and her family so much as well, they took me under their wing and showered me with love when I needed it most.
 
I’ve been going through a pretty low and isolated phase for the past 8 months after a lot had happened. We still talked every few weeks or so but it ended up getting to a point of once a month after September. I promised my self to put the effort into my friends and myself coming into the new year I was trying to get better with communicating with everyone in my life and started with her. I explained to her just everything been going on. She was super understanding and made me feel loved truly; she came to see me literally the next day at work. I got to hug her one last time. Something super major happened with my car the next day or so that really depressed me and I backed off for 2 weeks because I was just so overridden with thoughts. I never spoke to her, saw her, or texted her after I saw her that day. 

Having trouble dealing with all the emotions. I don’t know what to do or how to feel honestly. Really feels unreal I just feel overflown with sadness every time I think about everything which is every second. Why did I not make myself spend more time with her I didn’t expect it to just run out like this so unexpectedly. I feel so guilty I know I shouldn’t but I just miss my sweet friend. I wish I didn’t take that time alone from everyone but mainly her obviously.

1itnvan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Synesthesia/comments/1itnvan/my_temperaturetaste_synesthesia/,My temperature-taste synesthesia,"For as long as I can remember, everything tastes sweeter when it's warm, and more bitter when it's cold. Another interesting side effect is that if something is super cold or super hot, then there is an overwhelming taste of nothingness that seems to overpower any other tastes that may be there. I fondly remember how I thought I discovered a life hack by leaving soda or juice in the car on a hot summer day to make it taste 100 times sweeter, or how I was always confused as to why everyone hates melted ice cream, when it tastes so much sweeter. 

One day, after leaving a bottle of water out in the cold, and being revolted by its bitter, chemicaly taste, I thought to myself ""Wait a second, water is supposed to taste like nothing all the time"". That's when I started connecting the dots. Just to make sure, I asked other people if the taste of food is so drastically altered for them by its temperature, and I kept confirming it is not the case. Unfortunately, although I had identified it as a form of synesthesia, I have never found and records of this specific type of synesthesia ever, so I thought I might as well be the first to open up this discussion. 

Since it is only natural for most people to like sweet things, I myself like almost all of my food to be warm. It's like I have a sweet tooth specifically for warm food, and in fact, taking it away has been difficult and not even necessary for my health anyways, and thereby pointless. My partner likes to say that I'm lucky since it makes cutting down on sugars easier, and they're mostly correct, though some sweet things I crave can't be replicated by warming up some not otherwise sweet food. 

I sometimes think about how curious it must be to others that meat to me normally tastes like it's lathered in syrup, since it's usually served warm, and how that's just how meat is ""supposed to"" taste like to me. I've tried lukewarm meat (so not sweet, just savory) and I gotta admit, it tastes odd, although still not bad by any means. 

One of the most common questions I get asked is about ice cream. Yes, it does taste bittersweet to me. I don't think I'll ever be able to taste what ice cream is like to everyone else, though I'd love to try a room temperature version of it if it ever becomes a thing. I still somewhat enjoy it from time to time. Despite its bitterness, its sweetness is still noticable, albeit weak. Sometimes I'll microwave it for a few seconds to get ever so closer to what it's supposed to taste like.

Another interesting thing is I drink black tea, coffee, even espresso, completely black. I try to cut down on sugars in my diet, and when its warm, it all tastes sweetened anyways. However, once in a blue moon, I'll put it in the fridge overnight and drink it in the morning cold, because when it's super bitter like that, it gives me an extra kick in the morning that helps wake me up. 

Water I strictly prefer to be lukewarm. I neither like the taste of sugar-water, nor bitter water.

Pizza is one of the foods I love at all temperatures. Sure, it always tastes better when it's warm, but lukewarm pizza is still amazing, and even when it's cold/bitter, pizza is still god tier. That's how epic pizza is. 

Because I'm trying to cut down on sugars, I've had quite a few incidents where I asked ""wait, did someone add a lot of sugar to this, or is it my synesthesia again""? I have to ask my partner just to make sure. Similarly, I recently had some hot salsa (room temperature) and it tasted overwhelmingly sweet. I asked others if they taste the sweeteness and they told me they don't taste any sweetness. I then had a friend suggest that it could be the fact that spice triggers my heat receptors, it also triggers my synesthesia. It would certainly make sense. Likewise, I've played around with peppermint oil and menthol and discovered that it tastes super bitter. Now sure if other people here have tasted either, but if they have and it's not bitter to them, then I guess it's the same effect as with spice but the opposite, that is, cold receptors triggering a bitter taste.",4,1740018676.0,Synesthesia,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1itns5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/radio/comments/1itns5i/nostalgia/,Nostalgia,"The summer after my sophomore year at James Madision University, I served as an intern with WYYD, the central Virginia country radio station which was at the height of its powers in the mid-nineties, dominating market share and serving as a cultural touchstone in the heyday of Garth Brooks, Martina McBride, and Shania Twain long before bro-country, cell phones, and no smoking signs.

I spent time with multiple divisions, including sales, engineering, and leadership, but my favorite, by far, were my many hours on-air.  The idea was that I would rotate responsibilities and exposure every few weeks, but I developed such a relationship with the morning DJ's that they invited me to participate in the Steve & Dave show every morning throughout the summer before going out on sales calls, riding up to the broadcast tower on the mountain, or sitting in a management meeting.  

Steve and Dave (his real name was Robin, but they already had a Robynn on the afternoon drive shift) were neurotic, hilarious, overcaffeinated, and largely fueled by nicotine and cynicism, but they loved having a built-in teenage laugh track and a youngster to make fun of or send on prank assignments.  They pejoratively dubbed me ""Rainboy"" because Rainman had been a recent hit and my middle name made it a natural choice.  

One morning, a relatively uneventful show nearly turned into a conflagratory event when either Steve or Dave failed to adequately extinguish their cigarette prior to tossing it in the trashcan.  It's a wonder I didn't pick up a smoker's cough that summer as the leadership, the salesman, and especially the talent tore through cartons of coffin nails throughout the workday back when indoor smoking was still an acceptable behavior.  While Steve was working the sound board during a commercial break, Dave was visible through the picture window running back and forth in the hall waving his hands in the suddenly smokey air, looking for a fire extinguisher.  I left the DJ booth and found a small plastic waste basket in the break room with flames shooting up perhaps 18 inches.  I smothered the flames with a box of printer paper almost immediately, but that didn't stop Dave from spraying the extinguisher foam all over the smokey, melted mess and then dumping his coffee on it for good measure.  When we returned to the booth, Steve was very professionally continuing with the show, but invited us both to process the ""nearly catastrophic"" event on air.  It was the rare time that they couldn't mock Rainboy for being a silly intern and they even let me have the mic for a bit without interrupting.  A couple of callers even suggested that I should get my own shift.  

Bowing to public pressure and always on the lookout for a new bit, shortly thereafter, Steve and Dave sent me to the Kroger down the street for what felt like an elaborate gag at the time.  There was a bank of pay phones in the entryway near the grocery carts and they had me on one line calling in details of passers-by while ringing one of the other payphones in the hopes that someone would answer and join them on-air as they pretended to be telepathic while sharing the details that I had been feeding them.  I, being me, was not particularly subtle and I couldn't help but laugh as people initially struggled to figure out how Steve knew what they were wearing.  It didn't take long for management to figure out that something was going on.

An older cashier asked me to please hang up the phone and come with him to talk to ""security"".  He walked me to an office where I was left alone...with a phone on the desk.  

I called back into the show envisioning a Free Rainboy movement when they put me on the air, but I only got Dave on a smoke break.  He was uncharacteristically emotional about the idea of his intern being imprisoned at the grocery story as we brainstormed solutions.  

""What if I just walk out?""

""Yeah, yeah, do that!  No laws have been broken; they can't hold you.Run, Rainboy, ruuuuuun!""

I slipped out the unlocked door and got to my car just in time to turn on the radio and hear, ""We're just getting details that Rainboy has been detained by Kroger security and we just don't know if we're going to have to bail him out or if this could be the end of his internship.""  

Recognizing that this was my big moment, I sped back to the studio and burst through the doors of the DJ booth despite the unmistakable red ""on-air"" light, falling on the floor laughing as I explained that I ""got the hell out of there"".  Now, smoking was allowed, but even mild profanity was profoundly frowned upon in those halcyon days.  My next session with leadership included a tongue-lashing, but Steve and Dave were in LOVE with the reactions that they were getting from listeners, who found the entire event hilarious.  

It was a formative summer, including several live appearances at Cattle Annies, the then brand new country line dancing space in Lynchburg, and a very niche local celebrity status which led to more attention than this farm boy had ever had from a variety of interesting characters who religiously followed the morning show, but those will have to be stories for another day.",5,1740018415.0,radio,4,0.86,False

1itnral,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1itnral/the_importance_of_placing_keywords_in_your/,The Importance of Placing Keywords in Your Product Listings,"

When selling products online, visibility is everything. No matter how great your product is, if potential buyers can't find it, your sales will suffer. That’s where keywords come in. Strategic keyword placement in product listings is one of the most effective ways to improve search rankings and attract customers. In this article, we’ll explore why keywords matter and how to use them effectively in your product listings.


---

Why Are Keywords Important in Product Listings?

1. Improves Search Visibility

Most online shoppers start by searching for what they need. Whether they're using Google, Etsy, Amazon, or another marketplace, search engines rely on keywords to show relevant results. By including the right keywords in your product title and description, you increase your chances of appearing in search results.

2. Increases Click-Through Rates (CTR)

When your product listing matches what shoppers are looking for, they are more likely to click on it. A well-optimized title with clear, descriptive keywords makes your product more appealing and relevant to buyers.

3. Boosts Conversion Rates

If your listing contains keywords that accurately describe your product, shoppers are more likely to find exactly what they need. This reduces confusion, builds trust, and increases the likelihood of a purchase.

4. Enhances SEO Ranking

On platforms like Etsy, Amazon, and Google, product listings with relevant keywords rank higher. These platforms use algorithms to determine which products to show first. Using the right keywords signals to search engines that your product is relevant, improving its ranking over time.


---

Where to Place Keywords in Your Product Listings

1. Product Title

The title is the most critical part of your listing. It should be clear, descriptive, and include your main keywords.
Example: Instead of “Handmade Mug,” use “Handmade Ceramic Coffee Mug – Rustic Pottery Cup for Tea & Coffee”.

2. Product Description

Write a natural, engaging description that includes secondary keywords throughout. Avoid keyword stuffing—make sure the text flows smoothly.
Example: Instead of “This mug is handmade. Ceramic mug. Pottery mug,” use:
""This beautifully handcrafted ceramic coffee mug is perfect for enjoying your morning tea or coffee. Made from high-quality clay, this rustic pottery cup adds a warm touch to any kitchen.""

3. Tags and Attributes

Many platforms allow you to add tags or attributes (e.g., color, material, style). Use these fields to include additional relevant keywords.

4. Image Alt Text

Search engines can't ""see"" images, but they read alt text (a short description of the image). Use descriptive keywords to help your images rank in search results.
Example: Instead of “IMG123.jpg,” use “handmade-ceramic-mug-rustic-coffee-cup.jpg”.

5. Product Categories and Subcategories

Selecting the right category and subcategory helps marketplaces show your product in relevant searches. Some platforms also use category names as ranking factors.


---

How to Find the Best Keywords for Your Listings

1. Use Search Suggestions – Start typing your product name in a search bar (Google, Etsy, Amazon) and see what suggestions pop up. These are commonly searched terms.


2. Check Competitor Listings – Look at top-ranking competitors and see what keywords they use.


3. Use Keyword Research Tools – Tools like Etsy’s Search Analytics, Google Keyword Planner, and Marmalead can help you find high-ranking keywords.


4. Analyze Customer Language – Pay attention to how customers describe your products in reviews, questions, or messages.




---

Common Keyword Mistakes to Avoid

Keyword Stuffing – Overloading your listing with keywords makes it hard to read and can hurt rankings.

Irrelevant Keywords – Using misleading keywords to attract traffic can frustrate shoppers and lead to poor reviews.

Not Updating Keywords – Trends change, and so do popular search terms. Regularly refresh your keywords based on search trends and analytics.



---

Final Thoughts

Placing the right keywords in your product listings is essential for boosting visibility, attracting buyers, and increasing sales. By strategically using keywords in your title, description, tags, and images, you can improve your rankings on search engines and online marketplaces. The key is to keep it natural, relevant, and aligned with how your target customers search.

My husband is away on a business trip for two weeks, in a time zone 8 hours ahead. He’s winding down for the night and I’m in the middle of my day after both children have boycotted naps. 

My 3 month old and 2 year old are screaming. One is wanting a bottle, the other is wanting me to play with him, he’s gotten an applesauce pack out of the fridge and is actively smearing it in his hair. The 3 month old is screaming and arching to the point she’s going to throw herself off of the bouncer. The 2 year old is pulling things down off the counter and throwing them, my husband is trying to talk to me and get me to be all excited he’s coming home. I’m ecstatic, but right now I’m overwhelmed, overstimulated, overtired, anxious, depressed, burnt out, and literally feeling insane. 

We’re on FaceTime and I’m venting to him. Telling him how hard all of this is, why moms keep lying to each other that this is worth it, feeling like I’m failing, trying to etc… I’ve had on average 3 hours of sleep each night he’s been gone. Last night I have a stretch from 3:30-8… the night before that, I got 3 hours non-consecutively. We were also stuck in the house for  36 hours because it was -2 where I live. 

He decides that he’s pissed off and going to “withdrawal” or “go quiet,” on FaceTime because he’s not getting his happy go lucky, lovey dovey wife. Well guess what, I’m one thrown gummy away from needing a straight jacket. So he throws a tantrum bc——- after a long hard day of working, going to the bathroom by himself, eating in peace, showering in peace, going to the bathroom in peace, drinking a coffee that doesn’t get spilled, not hearing “no” 1000’s of times, not hearing “all done” 4000 times, being able to walk into a store without hearing “bye bye” 7000 times and a baby screaming to get out of the car seat—— he decides to throw a tantrum because our kids meltdowns and my being busy, mid anxiety attack, and pure exhaustion isn’t what he wants. 

I proceed to ask him what’s wrong— already knowing what’s wrong because this is a recurrent issue— him not getting attention the way he wants and throwing a tantrum. And he tells me that I vented and didn’t stop for a long time, that I’m not acting happy that he’s coming home, that I’m giving him “whiplash” for not being so happy and lovey dovey like always… 

I wrote him litters everyday for a week, sent sexting messages, sent pictures, valentines comes and the letters stopped (the whole point was to ask him to be my valentine in a different way every time) but I kept writing sweet messages. Some nights I just honestly got too tired and the messages would be short bc I would literally fall asleep writing them. But I sent a lot of little things about missing him and being excited he’s coming home… 

He literally caused a fighting in the middle of my kids screaming and me freaking out because of the kids. The proceeded to gaslight me and say it was my fault that I reacted this way to him getting upset for not having my attention… like… do you hear the children screaming??? Did you hear what I told you they did all day?? Or that I’m functioning on little to no sleep???? Do you see me about to lose it???? No, okay cool. 

Zero empathy.

To top it all off, I fell down the stairs after we hung up. I keep getting hurt after we fight, I’m starting to think he’s putting hassid on me tbh. ",17,1740018179.0,MuslimMarriage,21,0.87,False

We don't want or need the social benefits of a hostel (bonus points if it's something in a more quiet neighborhood), we just want a clean and safe place to sleep and shower, with hopefully reasonable parking. Priorities to us are to be near the beach, scenic spots, and good walking / hiking areas! We're really just coming to soak up some sun and enjoy being by the ocean for a few days. Of course we'd love to have some good coffee and food nearby too but it's not a requirement. 

  
The three options I'm looking at are:

Samesun Ocean Beach

ITH Mission Beach

ITH Beach Bungalow

  
They all have very similar ratings and features when looking at them on HostelWorld, so I'm hoping that someone in here may have stayed at one of those before and could provide some feedback / insight on their stay and if they'd recommend any of them or not! ",1,1740017861.0,hostels,0,1.0,False

I'm in the market to replace my Ninja machine, and all sings point MM. I have a few questions regarding the machines and which one would be most beneficial for my situation.

Daily use is about 16oz in the morning with breakfast and that's it. On the weekends I like to brew a full or half carafe and have 2 or 3 throughout the day. So the Cup One isn't really the model I'm interested in. 

I'd like to have a thermal carafe to not scorch the coffee for the weekends where I typically have a few (only good part about my ninja). I feel the KBTS would fit me best, but I've heard not so great things about the design of the carafe? Also what's the difference between KBT and KBGT? Your reccomendations are appreciated for which model. 

Grind size. I currently have a subscription with a local roaster that has 2 options: drip and French press. I don't know that I wouldn't want to get a grinder, but it would have to be a hand grinder (reccomendations for that are welcome as well). I can get a photo of myself drip Grind size that I have now if needed for a valid answer.

***Summary:*** Indiana Jones finds himself thrust into a race against the forces of Fascist Italy in 1935 in a search for the famed Spear of Constantine, said to contain the power to forge empires. Following a path set by Napoleon back at the end of the 18th century, Jones' travels take him to Malta, Egypt, Lebanon, and Cyprus as he teams up with the Vatican and Egyptian allies to stop Colonel Vittorio Ferretti and other conspirators from acquiring the Spear and using it to unleash a wave of conquest upon the world. 

**Episode 1**: ***The Search Begins...***

Set in the fall of 1935 in Fascist Italy, famed Italian treasure hunter and recently promoted Colonel **Vittorio Ferretti** leads a group of Blackshirts (fascist paramilitary) to raid an old monastery. There, they find the manuscript they are looking for, revealing that their search is for the famed spear of Emperor Constantine, rumored to give power in battle, could be fruitful, as there seems to be strong evidence that the spear was taken from monastery by Napoleon during the French Revolution campaign in Italy towards the end of the 18th century. The priest tells them that Napoleon too sought the relic by raiding churches, but was unsuccessful, just as Ferretti will be. Ferretti tells him that he will succeed, and kills the head monk, ordering the remainder of the monks to be killed. However, one monk survives and makes an escape.

In Vatican City, the Commander of the Swiss Guard, **Matthias von Amsler**, along with his lieutenant, **Heinz Kappler**  is briefed on the raid of the monasteries, with the escaped monk sitting before him sharing details of the attack. Von Amsler learns that the Blackshirts were after information about the Spear of Constantine, and sends for Father **Marco Conti,** the Vatican's foremost historian on the time period. Conti, von Amsler, and Kappler discuss the seriousness of the situation, noting Mussolini's desire to overthrow the Vatican and forge a new Roman Empire. Conti says they're going to need to recruit some additional help.

As class dismisses at Marshall College, Professor **Henry Jones Jr.**, aka Indiana, is wrapping up class when a figure slips into the back of the classroom. As class ends, it is revealed that it is Marco Conti, and the two greet each other as old friends, with Indiana apparently being close with Conti's now deceased son during time at a British boarding school the two attended. Conti quizzes Jones to make sure he's still on top of his game when it comes to Napoleon's campaigns, which Conti then hints were actually rooted in a desire to find a relic of great power, the Spear of Constantine. Jones counters that it is a myth, and Conti says he believes it's real, and that Mussolini is searching for it, and now the Vatican needs Jones' help to beat them to it. Jones agrees, and Conti informs him that they will need to return to the Vatican archives to determine their next steps.

Flying to Rome, Jones and Conti are met by Swiss Guard Lt. Commander Kappler at the Archives, informing them that the Vatican has made this an urgent task, and thus appointed Kappler to assist them in whatever way necessary. Jones and Conti begin to look into the diaries of an old monk who worked with the Knights of St. John to smuggle several treasures out of Malta before Napoleon and the French could find it. This leads them to determine that there may be more information to discover in the crypts beneath the old castle on Malta.

The crew boards a ship to take them to Malta, but on the ship, Conti discovers that Ferretti and several of his Blackshirts are on-board with them, forcing the crew to remain hidden and avoid being seen by them, as Conti and Ferretti are familiar with one another. Jones, Conti, and Kappler manage to slip away from them initially, but are discovered as they undock, leading to a chase scene in the harbor docks that sees Jones and crew escape, but now with the Blackshirts alerted to their presence on Malta.

The trio arrives in Malta and makes their way to Fort St. Angelo, meeting with a British officer overseeing the fort. He initially denies them access to the crypts, and then kicks them out when they further attempt to gain access. Later that evening, Jones and Kappler sneak into the Fort, and make their way down to the crypt. There, they find clues indicating that the spear was indeed in Malta, and that the Knights of St. John may have used an inside member of Napoleon's naval force to smuggle it out during his expedition there in 1798, thus suggesting that it would have almost certainly ended up in Egypt.

As they attempt to make their way out, they find that Ferretti and the Blackshirts have indeed followed them to the fort, and thus a shootout occurs, though with the noise alerting the British soldiers, forcing the Blackshirts to flee before they're able to apprehend Jones or Kappler. Jones and Kappler meet with Conti and inform him they're off to Egypt.

**Episode 2:** ***The Library of Alexandria...***

Back in Rome, Mussolini, and several generals are briefed by Col. Ferretti, with Mussolini becoming irate that he failed to acquire the Spear instantly, and now notes that the Vatican, and likely the British are now onto them. Mussolini informs Ferretti that he cannot fail again, and assigns several members of the OVRA (Fascist Italy secret police) to join his unit and ensure their success. Ferretti mentions he does have a lead on where Jones and crew are headed next, noting that he will have the unit heading to Egypt that evening.

Jones, Conti, and Kappler arrive in Cairo, and immediately head to meet with Dr. **Leila Anwar**, a colleague of Dr. Jones who specializes in the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt. As Indiana fills her in on what they learned about the Knights of St. John smuggling the spear with a French admiral, Dr. Anwar says she knows that there is a logbook from that ship here in Egypt, which may contain additional information about where the Spear might have ended up once it landed in Egypt. However, she says that the logbook is part of a private collection, owned by Greek shipping tycoon **Dimitrios Kazanis**, who is an Orthodox extremist who would be unwilling to work with agents of the Vatican, though Anwar suggests they might have other ways to access the logbook.

The four of them head to Alexandria. Conti sets up in a safe house there, while Jones, Kappler and Anwar infiltrate a party being thrown at Kazanis' estate. However, one of Ferretti's OVRA agents is tailing the group and discovers Conti's location. He brings two additional agents with him, and sneaks up on Conti, knocking him unconscious and taking him from the safe house.

Meanwhile, Jones and crew attempt to sneak off to the library wing of the estate, but find it's heavily guarded. Kappler causes a distraction, creating a chance for Jones and Anwar to sneak in. They rifle through the pages of the logbook, attempting to figure out which box it likely would've been stored in, with Jones finding a series of boxes listed with Latin coding on them, a likely sign of use by the Knights order. They find that the shipment was sent off to Avaris, an Ancient Egyptian city that was only a site of old ruins during the time of Napoleon's invasion. Confused as to why Avaris, Jones and Anwar attempt to search the book further but are discovered and held at gunpoint by members of Kazanis' guard.

Jones, Anwar, and Kappler are all tied up and held in the library until Kazanis can enter, revealing that he intends to sell this information to Mussolini, stating that he, like Mussolini, would do anything to bring upon the downfall of the Catholics and the Vatican. However, Jones is able to break free and a fight breaks out leading to a lantern being knocked over and starting the library on fire. Jones and Anwar end up getting separated from Kappler, and nearly are taken out by a fierery beam that falls from the ceiling. They manage to find their way out, and escape the party as the fires engulf the estate. They don't find Kappler however.

**Episode 3:** ***The Avaris Descent...***

Jones and Anwar return to the safe house to find it has been ransacked. While they are trying to figure out where Conti went, they hear someone attempting to unlock the door, instead kicking it down. Jones ambushes the man, knocking him on the head with a frying pan, only to see it is actually Kappler, himself also returning after finding a way out of the now burned down estate. They quickly wake him back up, only to notice that the Blackshirts must have staked out the safe house after kidnapping Conti, as several Italians with guns are seen approaching. The group quickly escapes and makes their way out.

They make it to a British hotel on the other side of the city, and debate what to do with Conti captured and his whereabouts unknown. Kappler insists they must abandon him and find the Spear before Mussolini's soldiers can. Jones insists they need to find him in order to solve some of the missing pieces in this search, and says he knows someone who can help them and that they will meet him in the morning. Jones and Anwar exchange some flirty looks as they part to separate rooms, with Jones doubling back and being welcomed into Anwar's room for the evening.

In the morning, they head to a dig site project outside of Alexandria, where Indiana Jones introduces Dr. Anwar and Kappler to **Sallah el-Kahir**, the finest excavator in all of Egypt, and another friend of Jones'. Jones fills Sallah in on their situation and he mentions that he knows that the Italian consulate had, that morning, begun exerting pressure on the Egyptians to take over a dip site at Avaris, meaning that Ferretti is already aware of the clue pointing towards Avaris, and that they might be able to accomplish both tasks of finding Conti and making progress on finding the Spear. Sallah also mentions that he can get them into the site, as his company has been contracted by the Italians to oversee a new excavation.

As Sallah helps them infiltrate the site, Jones, Kappler, and Anwar discover that Father Conti is being held in one of the tents on the outskirts of the camp, and sneak in and rescue him, as he reveals that the Italians believe they have located the chamber that Admiral Jean-Claude had sent the boxes off to. However, the group inspects the logbook further and discovers some clues suggesting they have the wrong spot, and that there is another chamber where the French had stored supplies.

The four of them then attempt to gain access to the underground chamber, but find it is booby-trapped, and the room begins to fill with sand. Jones is just able to avoid a horrible death for the crew by reaching the external lever through a crack in the ceiling, releasing the sand and unlocking a second chamber that takes them down deeper.

In the second chamber, they find two relics, an old leather journal as well as a golden chest bearing the insignia of the Knights of St. John. Anwar notices the insignia on the journal and swipes it into her satchel before the others notice it. Jones and Conti goes to investigate the chest, but stops when he hears a gun click behind him, turning around to find himself held at gunpoint by Kappler, who is revealed to be a double agent who is actually working with Mussolini to overtake the Vatican, noting that it is only through Mussolini's force of will that Italy will become a power once again, not the ridiculous religious non-sense of the Pope. Ferretti and the Blackshirts arrive and take the golden chest, opening it to reveal that there is nothing but some old bones in the box. Angered at another non-discovery, Kappler and Ferretti decide not to shoot them, and instead trigger an explosion which collapses the the door to the chamber and leave them stranded in there with no escape.

**Episode 4:** ***The Order of St. John***

Jones, Conti and Dr. Anwar are still trapped in the chamber, and attempt to find a way out but are unable to do so immediately. However, Jones notices an odd pattern on one wall and finds he can actually use a small stick of dynamite he had in his bag to blow open a hole in a different wall, as he and Anwar shield themselves on the other side as the explosion goes off. They enter into the new room and discover another passage out, as the crew eventually makes their way out of the ruins.

After getting out, Anwar reveals the journal she swiped, from one of the French admirals who was secretly a part of the Order of St. John and they turn through it to discover that the Spear was smuggled out of Egypt after the invasion, and that it has likely ended up in the Balkans, but exactly where is unknown, though they do have a lead. At that point, the group has a debate on whether or not to continue pursuing it, or leave it be since Kappler and Ferretti don't have a lead. However, Jones admits that he now really feels like the Spear exists, as people do not go to such massive lengths to hide and move something that doesn't exist. The group decides to double down on their search and heads to Albania to connect with a colleague of Dr. Anwar's. Conti sends a telegram back to Rome with updates.

Back in the Vatican, the Pope (whose name remains unused in this series) meets with Swiss Guard Commander von Anslem to hear the latest news on the search. The Pope tells Von Anslem that he is concerned about Mussolini acquiring the Spear, yes, but that he also fears what those in the Apostolic Palace might even do if the Spear arrives there, noting that Mussolini has a significant spy network, even within the church. The Pope tells von Anslem he needs him to find a much more secluded place for the Spear to go if it is ever found, as its power is too tempting for most men.

Ferretti and Kappler arrive in Naples, but are quickly approached by an agent who informs them that there is an urgent telegram from them. They read the note and are then quickly shuffled off to a cafe where they meet with an Austrian professor who is sympathetic to Mussolini's cause, Dr. **Hans Volk**, who brings them a piece from his personal collection, who indicates that the Spear was taken to Beirut, though where in the city is unknown. Kappler proceeds to head to Beirut with Volk, while Ferretti also receives word from his spies in Rome that Jones is headed to Albania, and says he will follow Jones and ensure he is dealt with.

As Jones, Anwar, and Conti arrive in Albania, they make their way to an old Crusader fortress on the coast, and begin exploring through the ruins. However, they soon find that the fortress is not entirely abandoned, as several armed men appear around them, living in seclusion in the catacombs beneath the church. Jones discovers that the men are the actual Order of St. John. As they begin to ask about the Spear, the leader of the Order, a man named **Ahmet Noli**, warns them that they exist to ensure the Spear remains hidden and that they will not allow Jones to continue his search. However, it is then that they hear the firing of artillery, as an assault on the fortress by Ferretti and his men begin.

Noli and the Order of St. John spread out and begin firing back on Ferretti and the soldiers he's with, as Jones, Anwar, and Conti join the fight. However, the Italian forces begin to overwhelm the Order, and so Jones and crew, along with Noli, turn to escape into the woods, being forced to use an inflatable raft to try and evade Ferretti's forces, who also use rafts down the rapids. Jones' crew ultimately escapes, finding shelter in a local village after dispatching the Italians pursuers in the rapids.

**Episode 5:** ***The Trail of Constantine***

In Beirut, Volk and Kappler arrive on scene and meet with a local sheikh, **Farid al-Masri**, as they request the use of some of his territory to excavate for a project, promising money and even political support for his desire to overthrow the French rulers of Lebanon. He agrees to the deal, and Volk and Kappler get to work excavating a piece of land in the hills just outside Beirut.

Jones, Anwar, and Conti make their way out of the forest and begin to question Noli about the Spear, arguing with him that they need to find the Spear before Mussolini's forces do. Noli says he cannot, due to his oaths, reveal the place he believes it to be located, but does say that Jones would be wise to continue his search by following the trail of Constantine. Jones and crew head to Istanbul as a result.

Jones, Anwar, Conti, and Noli arrive in Istanbul, where they seek out a Byzantine historian\*\*, Dr. Elias Karavelis\*\*, who specializes in Constantine’s relics. Karavelis initially refuses to speak with them, fearing repercussions from both Mussolini’s spies and Turkish authorities. However, after Jones shows him the old journal that they have discovered from the Order of St. John, Karavelis realizes they are on the right track.

Karavelis explains that Constantine once moved sacred relics between the cities of Berytus (Beirut) and Constantinople, likely using the old cistern network beneath the Hagia Sophia for safekeeping. They descend into the Basilica Cistern, navigating ancient tunnels filled with Byzantine iconography. Along the way, they solve an inscription puzzle leading them to an ancient archbishop’s crypt, where they uncover a partially burned manuscript detailing the final resting place of the Spear—an old monastery near Beirut, once used by Bishop Eusebius, Constantine’s close religious advisor who is recorded as having baptized Constantine into the Christian faith.

The group explores the cistern networks and does indeed find the confirmation they are looking for, a painting hidden in a secret vault below the city that shows the Spear in what is clearly a Lebanese monastery.

Back in Italy, Von Anslem meets with Cardinal **Vincenzo Belluzi,** whom he is making preparations with to send off the Spear to an isolated monastery in Cyprus where Belluzi's brother is currently assigned. However, Belluzi is somewhat nervous about it, noting his fear of Mussolini's spies and his increasing hostility towards those in the Vatican working against Mussolini's attempts to expand his power.

Ferretti is met in Tirana by Italian general **Luigi Ricci**, one of Mussolini's top generals, who informs Ferretti that Mussolini is outraged and wants Ferretti recalled from the mission, likely to be stripped of his station, demoted, and possibly even banished for his failures. Ricci, however, tells Ferretti that he is going to let him go, but heavily implies that should Ferretti be successful, he should bring the Spear to Ricci rather than Mussolini, as Ricci is the one standing by him, noting that Mussolini is too blind to his weaknesses to lead Italy to the greatness it desires.

**Episode 6: The Battle of Beirut...**

Jones, Anwar, and Conti arrive in Beirut and debate what to do. Anwar wants to go to the French magistrate of the province and enlist their help, but Conti argues it's too dangerous to enlist them right now, as he fears that the French might just very well desire to seize the Spear themselves. Jones suggests the best course of action would be to find a list of all the known monastery locations in and around Beirut and begin narrowing them down.

The group heads to the French University of Beirut, meeting with Dr. **Jacques Leblanc**, who aides them in their search for the monastery sites, but then also reveals that he has heard of a renewed excavation happening in the hills outside Beirut at the spot where it was believed there used to be an old monastery that was largely collapsed in on itself. Jones and co. thank Leblanc for his assistance, though Leblanc becomes somewhat suspicious of their intent despite their answers that they are just here for research for a potential dig.

Spying on the camp from a different hill nearby, Jones and co. confirm that it is certainly Kappler running the organization, and question who the German with him is. Conti confirms that it is Hans Volk, a member of the German Nazi party, and that his presence spells trouble. However, before they can formulate a plan, several French soldiers arrive behind them, with a French commander, **Robert Dubois**, and Leblanc arriving, confirming Leblanc's suspicion that Jones was not simply here for a research project.

Kappler and Volk are overseeing the exacavation of the monastery, and soon gain access to the vault. They enlist some local Lebanese diggers to assist in breaking open the door. Kappler sends several of the Lebanese workers in ahead of them to check for traps, with his suspicion being confirmed as two of the workers are killed by traps. However, that seems to be the extent of it, as Kappler and Volk enter in behind them. They notice that one of the tombs seems to have been set more recently than the others, which they speculate would line up with the Order of St. John hiding the spear in the late 1790s/early 1800s more so than the older, less disturbed tombs.

Kappler takes a hammer to the tomb stone, breaking the wall there open to reveal a shining golden spear, ornately decorated. Kappler grabs the Spear, and feels a surge of power running through him whilst holding it. He pivots quickly holding it and accidentally triggers it, seeing a wave of fire explode from the edge of the Spear, melting one of the walls of the stone with Greek fire, confirming the power of the spear. One of his lieutenants rushes in and tells him that there are French soldiers approaching their camp however.

Dubois, after hearing Jones' story, orders his unit to attack the illegal Italian excavation camp and ensure they cannot acquire the weapon, and orders Jones, Anwar, and Conti arrested, as they are handcuffed and placed in one of the trucks.

The French soldiers attack the camp, exchanging fire with the Sheikh's soldiers and some of the Italian soldiers there. The French appear to be winning, until Kappler emerges from the hill and unleashes the power of the Spear which rips through the French line with fire, killing dozens. The fire causes some explosions, and one ends hitting the van that Jones and co. are in, knocking it over.

Jones escapes from his handcuffs which broke off as the truck, and quickly frees Anwar and Conti, who agree they need to make a play for the spear before Kappler and the Italians can leave the battlefield with it. They sneak around the excavation site as some of the French soldiers rally and attack again. Jones and Conti make it close enough to Kappler unseen as Jones uses his whip to snap the spear out of Kappler's hands and send it flying. He leaps off the ledge and begins fighting with Kappler, who attempts to draw his gun and fire on Jones. Jones disarms Kappler, and is forced to choke him out as Kappler attempts to draw a knife on Jones. As Kappler dies, Jones releases his grip, only to realize that Kappler had hit Conti in the gut. Conti bleeds out and dies, telling Indiana that he needs to ensure the Spear doesn't end up in the wrong hands.

**Episode 7: Who to Trust...** 

The battle continues on as the French soldiers drive out the Italians and Lebanese forces from the site. Before Jones can recover the Spear, Volk rushes forward ahead of him intent on acquiring it first. Jones and Anwar chase after Volk, leading to a brutal fight on the side of the hill with some of the monastery outcroppings from it. Volk, though not as physically imposing as Kappler, is cunning and ruthless, using the terrain and dirty tricks to his advantage. As they struggle, Volk manages to grab the Spear and tries to wield it, but unlike Kappler, he hesitates. The weapon’s power is unstable, and when he attempts to summon fire, the blast is uncontrolled, setting the ruins ablaze. Jones and Anwar barely escape as Volk is engulfed in the inferno.

Jones and Anwar grab the Spear, but ensuring Jones keeps it wrapped in some cloths and such to ensure the power doesn't begin to channel through him. They make their escape, avoiding the remaining French soldiers as well, and make their way back to Beirut. 

With the Spear in hand, Jones and Anwar debate what to do with it, debating whether or not to entrust it to the Vatican, and risk Mussolini's forces apprehending it as they attempt to sneak it into the heart of Rome, or find somewhere to dispose of it or hide it. However, they are met in Beirut by none other than Matthias von Amsler, the commander of the Swiss Guard. He tells them that he has arranged for safe and secretive passage for them back to the Vatican, and informs them that the Pope has ordered him to help find a more secure place for the Spear, as the Pope doubts the security of the Vatican given all the spies. Jones and Anwar agree to accompany him back to the Vatican and to help ensure it doesn't fall into the hands of Mussolini's forces.

Jones and Anwar press von Amsler as to where the Spear will end up, and he informs them that he and Cardinal Belluzi have arranged for it to end up at a quiet, hidden away Franciscan monastery in Cyprus. Jones says he'll need to gauge Belluzi's trustworthiness before he hands it over, to which von Amsler agrees. He says Belluzi will meet them in Nicosia in two days, and so they board a ship to head to Cyprus. 

Meanwhile, in Nicosia, Belluzi is sitting outside at a cafe, reading a paper and drinking coffee when General Ricci pulls up a chair at the same table. Ricci informs him that Kappler, Ferretti, and Volk have all failed, but that the plans to remove the Pope will proceed nonetheless, per Mussolini's instructions. Belluzi then mentions that he has made arrangements that will still procure them the Spear, despite the failures to actually seize it, as Belluzi mentions that he manipulated von Amsler into bringing the Spear directly to him. Ricci is surprised to learn the Spear will be in Nicosia the next day, and asks Belluzi what he intends to do with it. Belluzi smiles and informs Ricci that he does not intend to wield it himself, but rather knows that *whomever* wields it, certainly could ensure he is the new Pope, with a prominent role leading a new Roman Empire to glory alongside the Roman Catholic Church. 

Ricci understands the implication, and informs him that Mussolini is a bit too anti-religious, and would use the Spear to obliterate the Vatican just as soon work with them. Belluzi then asks Ricci his opinion on the church's value as an ally, to which Ricci responds that he finds the idea of an alliance there to be very valuable. Belluzi tells him that it is then settled, he will acquire the Spear, Ricci shall remove the current Pope, and at that point, Belluzi will become the new Pope, and then give Ricci his blessing to expand Italy's borders, declaring a new Crusade against global apostasy. 

**Episode 8: The False Prophet**

Jones, Anwar, and von Amsler arrive in Nicosia under heavy secrecy. With Belluzi’s duplicity unknown to them, they prepare for the handoff at a secluded monastery outside the city. However, Jones remains suspicious. He pushes von Amsler about Belluzi’s loyalties, but the Swiss commander insists that the Cardinal has always been a staunch defender of the Church. Jones, unconvinced, decides to investigate further before surrendering the Spear.

Meanwhile, Belluzi and General Ricci finalize their coup. The Pope’s removal is already in motion, with the orders going out to begin removing some Vatican officials who are antagonistic to the fascist cause. Belluzi’s ambition is no longer just to wield power from behind the throne—he intends to be the throne. With the Spear, he will declare himself the rightful leader of Christendom and endorse Ricci’s conquest under divine authority.

As night falls, Jones and Anwar secretly follow Belluzi to a clandestine meeting with Italian officers. Overhearing their conversation, Jones confirms his worst fears: Belluzi plans to present the Spear to a powerful figure who will wield it on his behalf, ensuring his rise to the papacy. However, before Jones and Anwar can slip away, they are caught. Ricci and his men take them prisoner and seize the Spear.

Jones and Anwar are bound and brought to the monastery, where Belluzi, draped in ceremonial robes, prepares a grandiose ritual. Ricci stands by, intrigued but skeptical, watching as Belluzi proclaims the dawn of a new Holy Empire. He grasps the Spear, expecting power to surge through him, but nothing happens. Confused, he demands to know why it does not respond to him as it had to Kappler.

Jones, now unbound after managing to slip free during the distraction, steps forward. He reveals that the Spear only responds to those with conviction in their own dominance—Kappler had no doubts, only ambition. Belluzi, despite his arrogance, still sees himself as a servant of a higher cause, making him unworthy. Ricci, seeking his opportunity, steps forward and takes the Spear for himself. At first, nothing happens—but then, the power ignites. Fire ripples along the shaft, and Ricci, realizing what he holds, turns on Belluzi.

“I don’t need your blessing anymore,” Ricci sneers, before impaling Belluzi through the chest as the flames shoot forward and begin to burn. 

With chaos erupting, Jones and Anwar break free, engaging Ricci’s men in a desperate fight. Von Amsler arrives with a handful of loyal Swiss Guards, having uncovered Belluzi’s plot just in time. A battle ensues in the monastery courtyard, with Ricci, empowered by the Spear, tearing through his own men in his madness. The fight spills into the catacombs beneath the monastery, where ancient tunnels stretch toward the sea.

Jones, realizing they cannot let Ricci leave with the artifact, devises a desperate plan. He and Anwar lure Ricci onto a crumbling stone bridge over an underground river. As Ricci raises the Spear to strike, Jones fires his revolver—not at Ricci, but at the bridge supports. The stone gives way, sending Ricci plunging into the abyss below, the Spear vanishing beneath the rushing waters. Anwar nearly falls in herself, but Jones catches her by the arms and pulls her back up. 

Von Amsler, mourning the betrayal of Belluzi, solemnly declares that the Vatican must be purged of corruption, and intends to return to Rome to ensure this cannot happen again. He thanks Jones for his service, offering him a place among the Vatican’s secret protectors, but Jones declines, saying he'll be returning back to Marshall College until the next adventure that awaits him. 

As dawn breaks over Cyprus, Jones and Anwar prepare to part ways. Anwar, ready to return to Egypt, warns Jones that relics of power will always attract those who seek to control history and that the Italians aren't the only ones caught up in a desire for power. Jones smirks, and tells her he knows all too well. The two hug, and Jones boards a ship bound eventually for America, the morning sun casting long shadows behind him as he disappears into the horizon.

**Final Scene:** Deep beneath the monastery, water flows through ancient tunnels. The camera pans through the darkness, settling on a single glint of gold resting among the stones—the Spear, waiting to be found again.

😩Lies and betrayal on our anniversary? Unbelievable! 😡💔

""You've undergone IVF six times to conceive this child, Ms. Caldwell. Are you sure you want to give up? Is Mr. Spencer okay with this?""
""I'm sure he'll agree."" Callista Caldwell's voice is hoarse after a sleepless night. She's never felt more awake, though.
""I'll schedule the surgery for a week from now, then.""
It's Callista and Luther Spencer's wedding anniversary in a week. This is good—she can end things where they started.
After booking her flight out of the country, she places her hand on her abdomen. There's a blossoming life in there.
She's looked forward to this for the past five years. She never would've expected to give up on it before it could happen.
Chapter 1
The phone pinged again, showing the same trending topic that had been circulating for half a month.
Luther Spencer had spent a fortune on a luxurious estate. He had planted an entire garden of roses by hand to celebrate his fifth wedding anniversary.
Once again, he announced to the world that his heart belonged solely to Callista Caldwell.
Countless comments followed, and each of them was expressing envy for their love.
""Who says relationships with an age gap don't work out? Mr. Spencer's ultimate wedding gift is his hopeless devotion. It's said Mrs. Spencer is six years older, and it took him three years of relentless pursuit to win her over.""
""Everyone knows Mr. Spencer adores his wife. Two years ago, when Mrs. Spencer was trapped during the earthquake, Mr. Spencer risked his life to rescue her.
""He was covered in injuries when he was finally pulled out, and yet he was more set on comforting his terrified wife. The news even showed him holding her, and both of them were in tears.""
""And last year, when a media outlet mocked Mrs. Spencer for her age and claimed she couldn't have children, Mr. Spencer sued them into bankruptcy.
""He even made a public statement saying he didn't care whether they had children or not, but he would never allow anyone to hurt his wife over it.""
Callista couldn't help but force a bitter smile as she read these comments.
Luther truly did ensure no one could hurt her. Yet every pain she ever felt was dealt by him.
When Callista first confirmed her pregnancy, she had been eager to share the good news with Luther. But then she received a message from an unknown sender.
It was a photograph of a pregnant woman.
The young woman's smile was radiant as she posed for the pregnancy photograph. Meanwhile, Luther knelt beside her. He was reverently kissing her rounded belly. His face was filled with joy and contentment.
Tears streamed down Callista's face.
The ultrasound image she had suffered through six rounds of IVF to obtain now felt like a cruel joke.
On their wedding day, Luther had sworn he would love only her for the rest of his life. But it turned out the so-called ""rest of his life"" lasted only five years.
If that was the case, Callista decided she no longer wanted Luther in her life. And her child would not be born into a web of lies.
The door creaked open. Callista's tear-streaked, blood-shot eyes met Luther's, and he immediately panicked.
""What's wrong, honey? What happened? Don't cry—I'll fix it.""
He glanced at the ultrasound image on the table. Without looking too closely, he pulled her into his arms.
""It's okay if the IVF didn't work. Even if we never have kids, it doesn't matter. Having you is enough for me.
""Shh, don't cry anymore. It hurts me to see you like this.""
Callista gave a smile that looked worse than crying.
This man was such a hypocrite.
His child with someone else was about to be born, and yet he was saying this to her face.
Luther didn't notice the change in her demeanor and continued comforting her. ""Cally, our anniversary is in a week. I've planted an entire sea of roses for you and prepared blue fireworks. I'll set them off for you to see, okay?
""Isn't blue your favorite color?""
Callista stared at him blankly. She was still smiling even as tears rolled down her cheeks.
It seemed he didn't remember. She had never liked the color blue.
""Then, in a week, I'll give you an anniversary gift too,"" she said.
Luther's eyes lit up with excitement as he carefully wiped away her ""tears of joy.""
""Honey, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to your surprise.""
Callista silently stared at the ultrasound image.
She hoped that when the time came, Luther would truly be surprised.
Chapter 2
At noon the next day, Luther took Callista to the Spencer residence for lunch.
Luther's mother, Jane Dawson, never liked Callista. She didn't even bother to show up on their wedding day.
After the marriage, Luther moved out with Callista, only visiting his family at the end of each month.
""Honey, whatever it is that my mom says later, don't take it to heart. I'm always on your side. We'll leave right after lunch,"" Luther reassured Callista while holding her hand.
The moment they stepped through the door, Callista heard Jane's laughter.
""Oh, such a sweet baby! Those tiny hands and feet just melt my heart.""
Callista turned pale, and her feet were rooted to the ground. She recognized the woman sitting next to Jane—it was the same woman from the pregnancy photo.
""This is my friend's daughter, Wren Kirk,"" Jane introduced.
""She's pregnant, and her family's overseas, so they asked me to take care of her. I just took her to her prenatal checkup this morning.""
Jane linked arms with Wren and approached them. She handed Luther an ultrasound photo with a meaningful glance.
""Take a good look. Doesn't the baby resemble the parents?""
A flicker of panic crossed Luther's face as he responded with a faint warning in his tone, ""Mom, stop joking around. How would I know? This is my first time meeting Wren.""
Jane cast a glance at Callista and then pushed Wren forward. ""Well then, let me properly introduce you. Wren, this Luther.""
Wren's cheeks turned pink as she said, ""Hey, Luther.""
Luther gave a slight nod, then pulled Callista closer with one arm. ""And this is my wife. Callista.""
""Nice to meet you, Callista,"" Wren said softly.
Callista felt utterly numb. Her hands that were hanging by her sides began to tremble uncontrollably.
So, the entire Spencer family knew about Wren. She was the only one kept in the dark.
""What's wrong?"" Luther immediately grew concerned.
""Are you feeling faint from low blood sugar?""
He quickly retrieved some candy he always carried with him, unwrapped one, and brought it to her lips.
Callista opened her mouth mechanically. Though it was candy, all she could taste was bitterness.
Luther instructed the housekeeper to start serving the meal. He was still holding her hand as they sat down.
""You barely ate breakfast. Have more for lunch,"" he said gently.
Callista silently picked up her glass of water, but Luther swapped it out for a warm one.
""Your period's coming soon. You shouldn't drink anything cold, or your stomach will hurt again.
""The prawns today look good. Let me peel some for you.""
Luther barely ate throughout the meal as he was constantly tending to Callista and ensuring her plate was never empty.
""Luther is so good to his wife. I'm honestly jealous of Callista,"" Wren suddenly remarked. ""I love prawns too. Luther, could you peel some for me as well?""
Wren slid her plate toward him, but Luther acted as if he didn't see it.
""If you want prawns, peel them yourself. I only peel them for my wife,"" he replied.
Callista took a sip of the warm water while suppressing the urge to retch. ""Give them to her. I don't want any.""
Luther froze for a moment, then playfully pouted like a child.
""Fine, I'll eat them myself. Cally, how could you give away the prawns I peeled for you?""
Callista's eyes glinted with sarcasm. They'd already slept together, yet they still pretended otherwise.
Jane set her utensils down with a dark expression. ""Callista, wasn't this your sixth IVF failure? Since Wren is here, why don't you get some tips from her?""
""Mrs. Spencer, I don't really have much experience myself,"" Wren replied. She blushed as she shook her head.
""My boyfriend and I conceived on the first try. It just happened to be my birthday, so maybe being in a good mood helped.""
""Well, my daughter-in-law here is ten years older than you. She's not really comparable to you,"" Jane said with a mocking tone.
""I'm planning to let Wren move into the house so I can take better care of her. Plus, maybe her luck will rub off, and I'll have a house full of grandchildren soon.""
The moment she finished speaking, Luther cut her off firmly. ""I don't agree.""
Jane's gaze turned even colder as she looked at Callista. ""Why not? Just because someone here can't conceive, they just can't bear to see others succeed either?""
""Are you done?"" Luther's voice was icy.
""Mom, if you're determined to make me stop coming here altogether, then by all means, keep going.""
""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause trouble."" Wren stood up with teary eyes and hurried away.
Luther instinctively took a step forward as if to chase her but stopped himself, realizing how inappropriate it would be.
""I'm done,"" Callista said coldly as she watched the drama unfold. She stood and left without hesitation.
The moment she walked out of the Spencer residence's gates, a notification appeared on her phone—a verification message from Wren.
""March 5th is my birthday. That was our first time. He didn't let me leave the bed all day.""
That day, Callista had suffered her fifth IVF failure. She hadn't eaten or drunk anything and had locked herself in her room for an entire day and night.
When she finally gathered the strength to open the door, she'd found Luther disheveled while sitting outside her room. She had even pitied him and comforted him.
As it turned out, Luther had just rushed home from Wren's bed.
How ridiculous. How tragic.
She endured endless injections without complaint for five years. Yet now, the pain in her chest was unbearable, making it hard to breathe.
""Why are you crying, honey?""
Luther had followed her out. Seeing that her face was streaked with tears, he panicked and instinctively glanced at her phone.
Chapter 3
The phone screen dimmed automatically. Luther didn't pay much attention to it and pulled Callista into his arms. He gently patted her back.
""Shh, don't cry. It hurts me to see you like this.
""It's my fault. I shouldn't have brought you here just to upset you. She's my mother—you don't have to put up with her for my sake.
""You can yell at me or hit me if it makes you feel better.""
On the way home, Luther spent the entire ride trying to comfort her. Callista simply closed her eyes and pretended to sleep.
Occasionally, the sound of message notifications echoed in the car. Luther was busy replying to them for the second half of the drive.
When they arrived home, Luther stroked her head.
""Honey, there's an urgent matter at work that I need to handle. Wait for me here, and I'll come back early tonight, okay?""
Callista quietly got out of the car.
After Luther left, she accepted Wren's friend request and opened her social media feed. Pinned at the top of her profile were two photos.
The first was of Luther's back as he planted roses. The second was a sea of blue roses.
The caption read, ""Considering someone took the time to plant my favorite blue roses, I'll forgive you this once. Come and make it up to me.""
Callista's chest tightened at the sight. So Wren was the one who loved blue. Even the roses he planted for their anniversary weren't for her.
She hailed a cab and went straight to the estate. As soon as she arrived, she saw Luther's black Bentley parked nearby.
In the distance, Luther stood with his back to her in front of the sea of roses. He was unaware of her presence.
""If Callista could have children, I wouldn't have needed you. She's where I draw my line. How dare you show up in front of her and throw a tantrum?""
Wren's eyes brimmed with tears. ""Then why come to me at all? Just leave me alone!""
""Don't cry,"" Luther said. His tone softened. ""As long as you behave, I'll take care of you for life.""
Wren wiped her tears and smiled before throwing herself into his arms. ""I can be even better if that's what you want.""
""I cleared an entire afternoon for this. Do you really not know what I want?"" Luther's voice was hoarse as he scooped Wren into his arms and carried her toward the estate.
Just then, Wren glanced back and smirked at Callista. She had seen Callista standing there the whole time.
Through the windows, shadows of their entangled figures swayed and flickered. Callista stood frozen on the roadside. Her chest was heaving with every labored breath.
It felt like a barbed hook had torn into her heart, and each pull left behind a fresh, bleeding wound.
""Are you here to take pictures too? Mr. Spencer and Mrs. Spencer still have such a loving relationship after all these years. It's really enviable,"" a woman nearby remarked with a smile as she snapped some photos.
""Mrs. Spencer must have saved the galaxy in her past life. Every woman dreams of having a husband like Mr. Spencer.""
Callista laughed bitterly as tears streamed down her face. ""But she doesn't want him anymore.""
This so-called estate Luther gave her, symbolizing his devotion, was nothing more than a place where he slept with another woman.
The woman then stared at Callista and became somewhat stunned. It wasn't surprising she'd mistaken Wren for Callista.
After all, Wren bore an uncanny resemblance to Callista at 24, the year she first met Luther.
""I guess men are all the same,"" the woman murmured. Her tone turned despondent.
""At least Mr. Spencer is somewhat decent. He probably just wants a child too badly, even going so far as to find someone who looks just like you.
""Why not let it go? Pretend you don't know. Life will go on as usual.""
""It wouldn't be the same,"" Callista said quietly.
The fact that Luther sought out a woman who resembled her didn't make her feel grateful; it only made her feel disgusted.
After leaving the rose garden, Callista went to the hospital and collected pre-procedure medication for an abortion.
She placed the medicine on the coffee table and stared at it for a long time. She was still overwhelmed by a suffocating ache.
Suddenly, the door burst open. Luther rushed in with his shirt buttoned unevenly. He tripped and nearly knocked over a chair in his haste.
He scanned her from head to toe with a pale face. ""Honey, why did you go to the hospital?""
Chapter 4
Callista's medical card was linked to Luther's phone number, so the notification about her visit and prescription was sent to him.
""Honey, say something! You're scaring me,"" Luther pleaded anxiously.
Callista handed him the bag of medicine, and she lied, ""The doctor suggested I try a new medication. It might improve the success rate of the next IVF attempt.""
""As long as you're okay, that's all that matters. You scared me to death.""
Luther didn't even glance at the bag and casually placed it on the coffee table.
Callista let out a cold laugh.
In the past, he would always meticulously read the instructions no matter what medication she was prescribed as he was worried about potential side effects.
He used to say he couldn't bear the physical pain of IVF for her, but he needed to remind himself that she was suffering for his sake.
Now, she had personally handed him the pre-procedure medication for an abortion, and he didn't even bother to look at it.
The unfamiliar scent of perfume mixed with the aroma of roses in the air made Callista feel nauseous, and soon, her stomach began to cramp. She clutched her abdomen in discomfort.
""Is it your period?"" Luther leaned in, trying to warm her stomach with his hands.
Callista swatted his hand away.
""The smell on you is disgusting,"" she said bluntly.
Luther sniffed himself and chuckled.
""It's probably the scent of roses. I've been going to the rose garden several times a day, trying to make sure everything is perfect for our fifth anniversary. I'll go shower and change my clothes.""
But earlier, he'd said he was going to the office.
Callista couldn't be bothered to expose his lie and simply replied, ""Alright.""
After Luther left, Callista picked up her phone.
For the past five years, her social circle revolved entirely around Luther, leaving her with no close friends of her own.
If she were to leave him, there weren't many people she needed to inform, except for her younger brother, Kai Caldwell. Kai was also her only remaining family member.
But as she stared at his number, she couldn't bring herself to call.
Kai held Luther in high regard as his brother-in-law, and she worried it would complicate things. It was better to wait until she was ready to leave.
That night, Luther lay beside her while gently massaging her stomach.
""Honey, I've delegated all my work for the next two days. Your first couple of days on your period are always the worst, and I can't leave you alone.""
Callista gave a nonchalant response, not taking his words to heart.
Then, a notification sound woke her up in the middle of the night.
""Sorry, did I wake you? There's some work I need to take care of. I'll put my phone on silent. Go back to sleep, honey,"" Luther said softly.
Callista kept her eyes closed, but she was no longer sleepy.
Luther's left hand continued massaging her stomach, while his right hand was free to reply to messages. The warmth of his touch and the occasional low chuckles he couldn't suppress felt like a dull blade cutting into her, one stroke at a time.
""Honey?"" he whispered, testing the waters.
As he hoped, Callista didn't respond.
Luther withdrew his hand, quietly got out of bed, and tiptoed out of the room. Even as he moved silently, his eagerness was palpable.
""How dare you send those kinds of pictures over? Just wait—I'll make sure you can't get out of bed tomorrow,"" he muttered before the door clicked shut.
Moments later, Callista's phone buzzed several times. It was a message from Wren.
""Are you getting old and unattractive, Cally? Luther's been so pent up that he couldn't get enough of me this afternoon.
""He even said he wanted to try something new with me tonight. Can you believe it? He has no consideration for this poor pregnant woman.
""Honestly, I feel bad for you. Luther did plenty of the work to make me pregnant. Meanwhile, you're stuck with sterile IVF procedures, and you still can't conceive.""
Even in the bedroom that was warmed by the heater, Callista felt frozen to the core.
She got up, retrieved a hot water bottle, and climbed back into bed.
For five years, she'd believed she had met Luther too late in life and that their time together would be too short.
But now, with only five days left, she found the time to be unbearably long.
Chapter 5
Callista went to bed late and woke up late as well. As she stepped out of the bedroom, Luther came through the door while holding a bag in his hands.
""Honey, I bought your favorite honey garlic prawns,"" he announced while presenting the package as if it were a treasure.
""I rushed back to keep them warm for you. Eat them while they're hot.""
In the past, whenever Luther upset her, he would buy honey garlic prawns to cheer her up.
Callista never particularly liked them, but she always forgave him—not because of the prawns, but because she loved him.
What was this gesture for today? Was it to ease his guilt after spending the whole night with another woman?
""Honey, did you see the message I sent before I went out? When did you wake up?""
For some reason, Luther felt a vague unease over Callista's recent demeanor.
""No, I just woke up,"" Callista replied as she picked up her fork. She wouldn't let herself go hungry because of him.
When he saw her calm expression that seemed to have no trace of anger, Luther finally relaxed. ""I'll take care of some work first. When you're done eating, I'll join you for a walk.""
Callista continued eating while opening her phone.
Wren had just posted a new update.
""He spoils me so much. I casually mentioned wanting honey garlic prawns, and he immediately went out to get them for me.""
Attached to the post was a photo of a bag of the honey garlic prawns—the same ones Callista was eating out of.
Meanwhile, Luther let out a soft laugh across the table. Seconds later, a new comment appeared under Wren's post.
Luther replied, ""It's good that you're self-aware.""
Not long after, Jane chimed in with her own comment.
""Of course, he should spoil you. Just tell us whatever you want. You're a hero—not like someone else who takes up space but can't even conceive.""
Jane's comment was visible to Luther as well.
Callista glanced up. She was curious to see his reaction. He didn't seem bothered at all. In fact, he was wearing a smile. His expression was filled with warmth and contentment.
Callista chuckled to herself. She pulled up Jane's profile and blocked her on all platforms in one swift move. She had been wanting to do that for a long time.
Before Callista could finish breakfast, Luther's phone rang. It was Jane.
Her sharp voice practically burst through the speaker, and Luther frowned as he looked at Callista.
""Mom said she wants to bring you some herbal medicine. Did you block her?""
""There's no need. I'm not drinking it.""
Jane had a habit of sending her strange, bitter herbal remedies, none of which were helpful. Callista had forced herself to choke them down over the years, only to endure Jane's passive-aggressive remarks about wasting her kindness.
""But you can't just—""
Even if Jane couldn't send her messages anymore, the old ones were still there. Callista slid her phone across the table toward Luther.
The most recent message from Jane read, ""A woman who can't have children is worthless. You couldn't even keep the one you managed to conceive.
""You're such a failure. I won't allow the Spencer family lineage to end with you.""
Callista had been pregnant once in their first year of marriage.
But the baby's heartbeat suddenly stopped at seven months, and she was forced to undergo an induced labor.
Jane had made countless remarks blaming her over the years.
Callista, however, knew Luther had always tried to mediate and spoke up for her in front of his mother. Not wanting to make things harder for him, she had never brought it up.
But this time, Luther frowned at Callista.
""She's still my mom. You should try to understand her a little,"" he said.
""And who's supposed to understand me?""
Callista retorted with a cold laugh. ""Luther, you know how devastated I was back then.""
""But have you ever considered that there might have been a reason for the miscarriage?"" Luther sighed.
""Maybe you ate something you shouldn't have, or perhaps you used the wrong cosmetics…""
Tears spilled down Callista's face instantly.
""Don't cry,"" Luther said. He realized that he had said the wrong thing. ""I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.""
During her first pregnancy, Callista had been more careful than anyone else. She hadn't worn makeup even once, avoided eating out entirely, and refused to travel anywhere far.
When she lost the baby, her entire world collapsed. Luther stayed by her side every moment, never leaving her alone, and took care of her 24/7.
He had reassured her over and over. ""Honey, it's not your fault. Even if we never have children, it doesn't matter. You're all I care about.""
Luther was there for an entire month. He had pulled her back out of the abyss.
But now, she finally understood. He also believed it was her fault the baby didn't survive.
Chapter 6
""I'm sorry. You can hit me or yell at me. Just don't cry,"" Luther pleaded as he pulled Callista into his arms.
""I was spouting nonsense. I deserve whatever punishment you give me.""
Callista couldn't free herself from his embrace, and her tears continued to fall. But deep down, she knew the truth.
Luther hadn't simply misspoken; he was trying to shift all the blame onto her, to justify his infidelity as something inevitable.
Luther grew increasingly remorseful as he said, ""I'll make everything clear to my mom. You can consider unblocking her once she learns to respect you, okay?""
Tears streamed down Callista's face, but she smiled bitterly. Little did he know, there was no future for them anymore.
For the next two days, Luther stayed home to keep her company. Even though Callista barely acknowledged him, he busied himself with cooking all her favorite dishes.
Meanwhile, Wren's social media was filled with updates.
Baby supplies Luther ordered for Wren had arrived. He had booked a top-tier postpartum care center for her.
There were even specially prepared meals for expectant mothers, delivered personally by Luther. And he had left a ""like"" under every post.
That evening, as Luther brought her water for a foot soak, his phone rang.
""It's your brother,"" he said, putting it on speaker. ""He said he just landed a big client and is celebrating. He wants us to join.""
Kai's voice came through the line. ""Hey, Cally, it's been ages since I've seen you. Come with Luther, okay?""
With only two days left before she planned to leave, Callista didn't know when she might see her brother again. Hence, she couldn't refuse him.
""Okay.""
Kai had arranged a small barbecue gathering in the Caldwell residence's backyard.
When Callista and Luther arrived, Kai greeted them warmly.
""Cally, I know you don't like the smell of smoke, so I had them put all the cigarettes away. Pretty thoughtful of me, right?""
Before Callista could reply, someone nearby exposed him. ""Liar! It was Luther who reminded everyone to put the cigarettes away.""
""Luther truly treats Callista like a queen,"" another teased.
""He has to! Otherwise, why would I accept him as my brother-in-law?"" Kai laughed.
Luther rolled up his sleeves and started grilling Callista's favorite meat.
""My wife deserves everything good in life,"" he declared.
""Honey, sit here. Don't let the smoke bother you. Tell me what you want to eat, and I'll grill it for you.""
Callista stayed silent as she was not in the mood to play along.
Suddenly, Kai spoke up. ""Luther, we're out of drinks. Come help me grab a few cases from the basement.""
Luther patted Callista's head gently. ""Wait here, I'll be right back.""
As soon as they left, Callista's phone buzzed with a location pin from Wren. She was at the Caldwell residence too.
Callista's heart clenched. Fearing Kai might act impulsively, she got up and followed them. But the tense confrontation she had imagined didn't happen.
Instead, she saw the three of them standing together, chatting and laughing.
Wren looped her finger around Luther's, and her tone was playful as she said, ""Your son's been kicking me a lot. He must miss his dad.""
""Luther, I'll leave you two to it. I'll grab the drinks myself."" Kai grinned mischievously, and he walked off to give them space.
As soon as he walked away, Luther pulled Wren into his arms. ""So, only my son misses me?""
""You already know the answer to that,"" Wren teased.
Luther chuckled, kissing her as they headed into a room—Callista's childhood bedroom.
Callista's blood ran cold, and her legs nearly gave out beneath her.
She thought back to when her parents passed away in an accident. She had only been 13, and she had begun juggling school and multiple jobs to support Kai.
For her brother, she had taken on every dirty, exhausting task imaginable.
Kai had cried so hard as he walked her down the aisle on her wedding day. He was barely able to speak through his sobs.
""If Luther ever bullies you, come home, Cally. Your room will always be here for you.""
But now, the two people she loved most had joined forces to deliver the cruelest blow.",2,1740017664.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False
1itnilf,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1itnilf/what_are_you_looking_forward_to_most_postbotox/,What Are You Looking Forward to Most Post-Botox,"I’ve started a list on my phone of all the things I am looking forward to doing post-botox, and I’m curious what others are, or were before you were treated. My list kind of makes me sad and realize how small this condition has made my life become.

Here’s mine:

1) Drink coffee again. As soon as I can, I’m buying myself an espresso machine as a botox success gift. Also really looking forward to spending a Saturday morning at my favourite coffee shop.

2) Start writing again. I used to enjoy creative writing, but by the time I am done work in the evening I am so bloated, sick and in pain that all I can do is lay in bed a lot of the time.

3) Go out for dinner, and then do something else afterwards. This is such a challenge for me right now. If I do go out, I need to go home and lay down afterwards. I am so excited to go to get a drink, ice cream, the symphony, whatever and not have to worry about it.

4) Take the train to a nearby city to visit my best friend for a day. I can technically do it now but it’s so hard, because by the time I’m on my way home, I’ve blown up like a balloon.

5) Go to a wine bar. I stopped drinking any alcohol because it makes my symptoms worse. I am not a huge drinker, but a glass of wine again would be nice.

6) Go out after work. My after work hours now are just me suffering. I am so excited to go out with my coworkers, go on a date, whatever.

7) Buy new clothes. I have an impossible time buying pants that fit me because of the bloating. I have to pretty much exclusively wear Uniqlo’s Easy Pants (an RCPD saviour, if anyone is curious because they look like normal pants but have an elasticated waist).

8) Work out regularly without feeling so sick/in pain that it’s impossible/difficult.

9) Join a local book club/knitting club and meet new people.

10) Leave Toronto. I came here for grad school and stayed because it was easier to find a job, but I’m ready to leave for suburbia now. Don’t know if I could juggle a new job while feeling so awful, so excited to find a new position and get out of here.

 I’d really love to hear other people’s lists, if you’re willing to share.",3,1740017616.0,noburp,1,1.0,False
