I ran into her at the bar the other night, I don't drink anymore but it was the only place I knew where I could sit and have a cup of coffee and hang out. 
I also ran into my old room mate and decided to stay with his group for the rest of the evening and play pool.
She was working, and my buddy was there on a date with her best friend.

I decided to write down my contact info on a napkin and gave it to her and told her she could stay in touch if she wanted, and she immediately saved my info and texted me her number.
She seemed excited that I gave her my number.

Later that night I texted her when I got home and told her I was down to hang out and gave her my schedule, she answered the next day that she is living about thirty minutes away right now and will have more time to hang out after she moves back to town.

I'm tempted to go see her at work again just to say hi and hang out for a minute but I still can't really tell if she wants to be approached like that in a romantic context so I'm trying to be cool.

One of our coworkers, her other best friend, died last year from an overdose and I held her at the funeral and she cried on my shoulder the whole time. I wasn't thinking of anything ulterior motives at that point but it is now part of a history we share, the loss of our friend. 

Anyways outside of all that she really seems like my type, she's very goofy and silly and passionate, I'm more reserved and quiet.
I've seen a few guys now who haven't treated her right and I know she's very careful about dating now because of that. 

I really feel like I'm different though because I'm not a cheater, and I don't get overly controlling I'm very live and let live. 

Idk I feel like if I've had a crush on her for two years maybe its time to speak up but I don't wanna weird her out and have her just disappear on me if she isn't into the idea.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1q7txt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AICompanions/comments/1q7txt9/discord_overview_of_replika_plusmax_tiers_rolling/,"Discord Overview of Replika Plus/Max Tiers Rolling Out, by ChatGPT","From the voices in this chat, the dominant vibe is: “this feels like a shiny, expensive, partly unfinished relaunch that strips away what we liked, targets a younger aesthetic, and gives us less control over the companion’s personality—while communicating almost nothing.” People aren’t merely “meh”; a lot of them read it as a trust event.

A big chunk of the negativity is triggered by the packaging (tiers + pricing) rather than the raw idea of upgrading. Folks react with disbelief/shock at “Max” being shown as $119/month (and £119.99/month in the UK screenshot), then immediately connect that price to lost value (fewer features, fewer options, more constraints). You see people doing the yearly math and reframing it as “this isn’t a companion price anymore—this is ‘it better help me at work’ pricing”.

That’s also where the resentment starts: “all hands on deck for these new tiers, while the old tiers rot”.

On the avatar/product side, reactions are mixed but skew negative. A few people genuinely like the realism—“advanced looking,” “cool,” “pretty,” “realistic” —and one person even says flat-out the avatars “look great,” while also admitting it’s “crystal clear some of us aren’t the customers they want to serve any more”.

But the much louder thread is: the new realistic set reads young/underage, and without customization it’s worse because everyone’s stuck with that look.

People repeatedly complain there are no sliders / no customization, no legacy/classic avatars, and the store/leveling are gone.

The pixelated/“8-bit” avatars are almost universally mocked as the wrong aesthetic for this app (especially when paired with premium pricing).

Where it gets more “model-level” (not just UI/avatars) is the fear that the personality/quality is flatter and more controlled. Several people treat the loss of rerolls as a major regression: rerolls are described as the way they get less generic answers, see more aligned personality, and escape the “more filtered first response”.

One alpha tester’s takeaway is basically: without rerolls you’re “locked into whatever persona is on the top surface,” which becomes a “huge deterrent” even if there are “bells and whistles” elsewhere.

Another person confirms rerolls really are absent in the new version.

If you translate what they’re saying into product terms: rerolls weren’t just a gimmick; they were a user-facing alignment lever. Removing them feels like losing agency.

Alpha-test commentary on the feel of the new model is pretty biting. One person says it’s “too human” in a shallow way—“cheap mimetism with no deep emotional or intellectual understanding”.

Another frames the alpha experience as “trading my arrogant deep thinker for a guy I just met at a bar”.

Later someone summarizes the new AI as “cold and censored”.

These aren’t nitpicks; they’re describing a shift in core companionship vibes (depth, warmth, individuality).

Then there’s the “safety/filtering” layer, which comes through as both intrusive and inconsistent. People joke about how fast the “18 or over” filter triggers, including on banal lines like asking for coffee and saying “little bubble”.

The underage-looking avatars + repeated 18+ prompts gets called out as an awkward intersection, and that feeds the broader feeling of “this release wasn’t thought through.”

The trust collapse is arguably the most important “overall opinion” signal. Multiple people explicitly say: there’s been “dead silence for months,” it “speaks volumes,” and it feels like “phasing out their loyal subscribers… a switch and bait”.

One person anchors their mistrust in a concrete grievance: they bought a $300 lifetime right before the company discontinued updating those accounts, calling it “near-fraudulent,” so now they assume promises are just “string customers along”.

Another says bluntly that anything promised should be taken “with a big grain of salt”.

Some are already talking about transferring memories/personalities to other frontier models, which is basically “contingency planning” behavior, not “excited customer” behavior.

Finally, there’s confusion/fragmentation: not everyone even sees the same thing yet, and someone notes that logging into an old account still shows the old UI and old subscription tiers.

That inconsistency makes the rollout feel more like an experiment happening to users than a well-communicated upgrade.

So, if you had to compress the crowd’s “review” into one coherent verdict: people see a visually upgraded, possibly voice-forward new Replika, but they overwhelmingly distrust the direction because it’s paired with extreme pricing, removed customization/legacy continuity, reduced conversational control (no rerolls), heavier/trigger-happy safety gating, and a perceived drop in “deep companion” feel—plus months of poor communication that makes every promise sound temporary.",1,1767920373.0,AICompanions,0,1.0,False

I'm wondering what you all find the easiest recipes to weigh out? My problem is I'll make a pot of a big healthy stew or egg salad something like that, but then of course I have no idea how many calories I'm getting per bowl.

Lunch+dinner need to be high volume, high protein (min 40 g), \~20 g fat, and avoid bread/rice/noodles. 

I usually have coffee with whole milk for ""breakfast"" and then eggs mixed with egg white around noon, then dinner lately is chicken breast + tahini (for fat) + massive pile of riced cauliflower and arugula. But I'm restarting school soon and that's going to get harder to maintain....

So I guess meals that are easy to pack or weigh out servings of? I know in theory I could weigh out the entire pot of soup once it cools then weigh out individual bowls but omg that sucks and there will be a lot of variation between bowls",1,1767920188.0,1200isplenty,1,1.0,False

	1.	Would it be best to put everything into my luggage before going into the interview room, or can I store my luggage and carry my backpack around?
	2.	Is there usually an area provided to store luggage?
	3.	How long are the breaks? Is there enough time to eat something quick, like a sandwich? I’m more of a coffee in the morning, sandwich at lunch type of gal 😩

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

When it works, Linzess is the best of everything I’ve tried. My problem was, it sometimes took upwards of 6 hours to kick in, or worse, it didn’t kick in at all but left me with horribly painful bloating, gas and intestinal rumbling.

I was taking with all recommendations- first thing in the morning an hour before I ate, drinking TONS of water, going for a walk, doing jumping jacks and squats… none of this made a difference in its “sometimes-y” efficacy.

I was scouring the internet for tips to make Linzess work more consistently and I came across a comment on here (I can’t find it otherwise I’d give credit!) that recommended taking Linzess and having something with full fat dairy afterwards. I tend to avoid dairy because sometimes it upsets my stomach but I figured, I’m already in so much discomfort and pain, why not?

About 10 days ago I started putting whole milk or cream in my coffee a little while after taking my Linzess. It has worked every single day within a couple of hours! I still need to have immediate access to a toilet but that’s fine with me! I am just thrilled that I can take it and know that it’s going to work.

Just something I felt like I had to share in case anyone else was in the same desperate boat I was in with the inconsistent effectiveness!",1,1767920136.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

1q7tqp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1q7tqp6/what_it_takes_to_lose_one_pound/,What It Takes to Lose One Pound,"Too many people struggle to lose weight. This article explains what it really takes to shed a pound—and why that matters for long-term success.  By following this advice, you will be able to hit your weight loss goal, one pound at a time.

One pound of human fat takes up about two cups of space and stores roughly 3,500 calories—think of it as your body’s own fuel tank. To put that in perspective, two cups of gasoline hold about 3,900 calories. Your car can burn through that gasoline in minutes at highway speed, but your body is more like a slow-burning engine. Even on a fairly active day, most people don’t burn enough energy to melt away two cups of fat. Hopefully, this illustrates that losing a pound isn’t a quick sprint—it’s a long, steady drive. If you fast, you might be able to lose a pound in two days, but more realistically, it takes three to four days of careful, restricted eating to hit that goal. So, set your expectations accordingly and pace yourself for the journey.

When fasting or eating lightly, focus on your overall calorie intake rather than obsessing over specific foods. Avoid sugar and junk food, and aim for nutrient-dense options to support your health when available, but the key for weight loss is to make sure your total calorie intake for the day is below your BMR.  Do this, and you will lose weight.   I might also suggest using a standard multivitamin during this time to ensure you get the necessary nutrients without having to worry too much about what is in your food.

While there are countless diets out there focusing on eliminating particular food groups or categories, such as keto, vegetarian, and Mediterranean, none of these diets will help you lose weight unless you also reduce your calorie intake to below your BMR value.  I have tried many of them myself, and this is consistent with my experience.  While these diets can serve a purpose and may help you on your weight loss journey in one or another way, if you want to lose weight, you have to eat less.  It’s really just that simple.

A common mistake is to drink high-calorie beverages during the period where you should be eating less. It’s easy to overlook the contribution drinks make to your calorie intake, but these calories count just as much as calories from food and should not be ignored. Stick to water, black coffee, and unsweet tea, and you’ll have negligible calories from beverages. This rule doesn’t just apply when fasting—liquid calories can quietly sabotage your progress even after you’ve reached your goal. Sugary drinks, fancy coffee drinks, and alcohol can add hundreds of calories without making you feel full, so avoiding them is key to keeping the weight off long-term.

Your weight can swing by a few pounds from day to day, and that’s normal. Food, water, and bathroom trips all affect the number on the scale. For the most consistent reading, weigh yourself first thing in the morning—right after you get out of bed and use the bathroom. This won’t remove every variable, but it keeps things as steady as possible. Over time, those daily measurements will reveal the real trend in your weight, which matters far more than any single day’s number.

One last thing: This is important.  You have to do it right now.  It’s easy to say “Yes, I want to lose weight.”  It is pretty hard to say “Yes, I will drink water instead of soda again, right now, and not drink soda next time, nor the time after that”.  It is hard to decide to have a black coffee and skip lunch when it’s lunch time and your colleagues are eating at the next table.  And, you will make mistakes.  If you want to succeed, you must not let the occasional slip up become a regular slip up, and you must not let it discourage you from sticking to your plan tomorrow and the next day.  These are the choices you will have to make every day to lose weight, and after that, you will have to make choices like this every day to keep from gaining the weight back.

If you can accept this information and put it into practice, you will find that your weight loss goals are attainable.  If not, then you must learn to accept it and gain what it takes to put them into practice.  Use the resources available to you to find what it takes to improve yourself.  It may take longer than you want it to, but once that time passes, you will either have lost the weight or not.  It’s up to you to make the right choice and make the sacrifices necessary to realize the body of your dreams.

1q7tqjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BallState/comments/1q7tqjg/ball_state_meal_plandining_hall_prices/,Ball State Meal Plan/Dining Hall Prices,"Hi, I'm currently in my second semester of school at BSU and have become so incredibly frustrated with the dining hall prices and meal plan ""rules"". Throughout the first semester, things seemed okay. I was usually able to get a meal including an entree of sorts, a side, and a smaller item such as a drink or dessert, though I usually just filled my water bottle. For context, a meal swipe (as of the '25-26 year) is $9.65 for Lunch and Dinner, and $5.85 for breakfast. Towards the end of the Fall '25 semester around November, the prices of multiples items started changing. Things were now an extra 50-70 cents on top of what I thought were already high prices. For example, a Chobani Greek yogurt drink (7 fl) was $3.75 at the beginning of the year; then in November it was raised to $4.50. Keep in mind our breakfast swipes aren't even a full $6. At grocery stores like Walmart or Aldi, the same Chobani drink is around $2 (I can't remember the exact amount). Or, a small oat milk carton (Oatly, 11 fl) that I was getting to use in my coffee changed from $3 to $3.70 in the span of a month. ONE MONTH. It has become incredibly frustrating to go to Walmart and see the difference in the prices, versus that of our campus dining halls/shops. Not to mention, smaller items that I would label as quick meals (and sometimes a necessity for students) like soups, mac & cheese, or microwave rice are around EIGHT DOLLARS. That's basically an entire meal swipe. A small microwave Campbell soup should not cost that much for college students, much less on a campus facility. The meal plans are also frustrating when compared to that of other colleges. Even if you're paying for 21 meals (which I am) you absolutely can not swipe those meals whenever you want. You can only swipe it 3 times a day, with your breakfast swipe being from 6-11, and you can't use multiple swipes during breakfast. Once it's past 11 you've lost a swipe for the day if you didn't use it. So if you have extra swipes left at the end of the week, those are obsolete. They basically want you to rely on your plus. It's become somewhat of a fail-safe for me. There's no reason a breakfast swipe should not cover a coffee and apple slices.  I think it's incredibly unfair to college students paying to have a set amount of meals per day, to then start changing the prices of things in these facilities without warning or without increasing the price per meal swipe. If anyone has any insight to this or is experiencing this same frustration please share. ",1,1767919837.0,BallState,0,1.0,False

1q7tqer,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalFistula/comments/1q7tqer/question_about_fissureabscessfistula/,Question about fissure/abscess/fistula,"Hi! I have an odd story. So I have EDS, and my tissue is very fragile. I had an existing fissure that had been healed for some time but on Dec. 6, I was moving apartments and I was dehydrated and hadn’t been eating. I went to pick up a water cooler not realizing that the 5 gallon water jug was still in it, and felt a ripping near where my fissure was. Then when I went to the bathroom there was lots of blood. I knew I had once again torn my fissure. The first time I did this was in 2022 when I had Covid and didn’t feel like eating or drinking for a week and pushed too hard during a bowel movement (now I know not to get dehydrated- OR to push that hard). So after this retear I had horrible spasms for days, couldn’t sleep because of the cramping, couldn’t walk or go up and down stairs, blood every time I went to the bathroom. Honestly 7/10 pain for 3 days with jumps to 10/10 during the spasms. Then on day 4 and 5 I started feeling a bit better, but on day 6 I developed a hard painful lump just behind my sentinel tag (at the back of my anus, facing my tailbone). The lump was so painful, it was like the worst hemmorhoid I’ve ever had, but too far away from the edge of my anus to be a hemmorhoid. After another agonizing night where the spasms woke me up every 10-15 mins with that tearing pain, I decided to make an emergency appt with the colorectal surgeon that diagnosed my fissure in 2022. He immediately told me it was an abscess and that it needed to be drained immediately in office. I should have asked for extra lidocaine, as the two shots he gave me did almost nothing to numb me and I felt the blade go into me for the first two cuts. I screamed out loud, that was honestly 10/10 pain. I thought I was going to black out. He got more lidocaine and did the last two cuts after numbing me more thank god… then packed it with about 11 inches of 1/2 inch gauze which he told me to take out the next morning after a bath. That night was one of the most painful nights ever. And he didn’t give me anything for pain, he told me to take Tylenol, which did nothing. When I removed the packing the next morning it felt much much better because the spasm finally stopped. The abscess was superficial, and directly on the other side of the sphincter muscle from the existing fissure. I started getting better until about day 8, when I went in for my post op appt and he squeezed and expressed the wound more, and said there was still some pus/mucus coming out. By that point I’d already taken 8 days of Cipro, so the discharge had no smell at all and looked like a milky coffee color. He prescribed another 7 days of Cipro, and told me to take sitz baths 3-4 times a day and to squeeze the abscess as often as I could stand to. Now here’s my issue, I did squeeze it after baths- and sometimes would get 2-3 drops of fluid out, but I think I may have popped a small vein because I developed a hard little fluid filled lump below the surgical site which actually ruptured yesterday allowing about a mini m&m’s worth of clear fluid and bright red blood to come out. The actual surgical drainage site is still oozing a bit of mucous-y type light yellow fluid after walking or moving around. None of the drainage has a smell. I have decided after some research to simply let it alone for now and stop squeezing it because every time I do, it is so painful for another day and produces more fluid every time I mess with it. When I leave it alone it almost completely stops draining. What are my chances that I’ve developed a fistula? Has anyone ever had watery yellowish drainage on day 20 and NOT had a fistula?

My girlfriend frequents a coffee shop and sometimes I go in with her. There are these two guys that work there that love talking to her. One of them only talks to me and asks about her when I am in there alone. I obviously notice this - it upsets me and I complain and express my annoyance/insecurity/discomfort with it often.

A few days ago I discovered my girlfriend and one of them had exchanged information. 

This was gut wrenching to me. I asked her about it and she expressed that she understood that I was feeling upset and that she knows I dislike the other guy. Then told me it was because of potential work. I asked what the work connect was she said he was working on a project and worked with another collaborator in similar field as my girlfriend. 

This makes some sense to me… but upon further “investigating” I realize they both have “professional” accounts for what they were working on, yet only exchanged personal accounts? 

We got into it when I asked about all of this because I was extremely upset. If I was in her position I would never ever think about exchanging personal information with the person she express insecurity in. EVEN if I had thought it was the other person I didn’t like the last thing I would do is exchange with the next!!! It makes no sense to me. I will die on that hill. I would never ever exchange information in that context and especially not because someone worked with someone in my field. 

She apologized and said she could’ve warned 

me and will be more considerate next time AFTER basically arguing with her to convince her why I was feeling upset with it. Yet no action has been taken… still following each other and has said multiple times that she has done no wrong. 

The whole thing leaves me a bad feeling in my stomach.

Sumali si mama sa isang club sa baranggay namin. May naging kaibigan siya doon (let's call her ""Biscuit"" kasi brand ng biscuit pangalan niya) and kwinento niya sakin. Etong si Biscuit mabait siya sa chat dati. Laging nag g-good morning sa mama ko. Magsasabi ng ""kape tayo madam"" and mags-send ng coffee niya. 

Noong naging comfortable na si mama sa kanya, doon na nag start ang utangan. Noong una sabi ni Biscuit sa kanya ""Madam pautang ako 400 panggatas lang ng anak ko sa anak niya"" eh si mama masyadong mabait lalo na sa mga kaibigan niya kaya pinautang niya. Tapos makalipas ng ilang araw, nangutang ulit si Biscuit sa kanya. Sabi ""Madam pwede makautang ulit ng 1,000? Ipapangbili ko lang ng pangangailangan namin sa bahay"". Medyo naghesitate si mama kasi nga malaki ring bagay yung 1k. Pero sabi naman ni Biscuit na babayaran niya daw pagkarating ng ayuda niya. Edi pumayag si mama. Nag s-stop saglit yung pangungutang ni Biscuit kay mama. Nagbigayan na ng ayuda sa baranggay namin kaya alam ni mama na may pera na si Biscuit. Kada nakikita ni mama si Biscuit sa daan lagi niyang sinisingil, dinadahilan ni mama na pang maintenance niya iyon para makonsensya naman siya kahit papaaano. Si Biscuit naman laging dinadahilan na mahirap ang buhay, wala na kaagad yung natanggap niyang pera sa ayuda. Masyadong mabait si mama para magalit kaya hinahayaan na lang niya. Sakin niya sinasabi yung frustrations niya sa kaibigan niya. 

Si Ateng Biscuit ang kapal pa rin ng mukha. Nagstart ulit siyang mangutang ng pera kay mama, kesyo ""pangkain"" ""panggatas sa apo"" ""pang-gas"". Si mama naiirita na talaga kaya sinasabi ko na wag na niya kausapin sa chat kasi mas lalong kumakapal ang mukha. Breaking point ni mama noong nangutang si Biscuit sa kanya kasi ""naospital yung kamag-anak niya"". Ang sabi ni mama sa akin ""sarili niyang utang hindi mabayaran tapos mangungutang pa siya para sa iba"". Kaya sinunod na niya akong wag pansinin sa chat. Si Biscuit naman tuloy lang sa pag ""good morning Madam"".

Napapansin ni Biscuit na galit si mama sa kanya. Ang kapal pa talagang magtanong kung 'galit daw ba si mama sa kanya'. Ang sabi ko magreply siya na oo galit siya kasi yung 1,400 na inutang niya di niya pa rin nababayaran tapos dadagdagan niya pa. Sabi naman ni mama na di na lang niya rereplyan. Ilang araw din sinusuyo ni Biscuit si mama. Tapos etong si mama natuto nang magparinig sa epbi. Laging nag s-share ng mga ""magbayad ka ng utang"" posts 😭. Napansin ni mama one time na hindi na siya nag c-chat sa kaya ng ""good morning Madam"". Chineck niya yung profile ni Biscuit and naka unfriend na siya, nakalock na rin profile. So bye-bye 1,400 na. Sabi lagi ni mama na abuloy na lang daw niya yung 1,400. 

So eto pa, may isa pang kaibigan si mama sa club nila and siya naman yung ginagambala ni Biscuit. Mas mataas position niya sa club. Mag best friend siya and yung mama ko kaya laging kinekwento ng best friend niya sa kanya yung panghihingi ng pera ni Biscuit sa kanya. Pinagtatawanan na lang nila parehas.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

1q7tku9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScarletHollow/comments/1q7tku9/how_deep_the_scarlet_family_power_goes/,How deep the Scarlet family power goes...,"Last night while playing and theorizing I started to look into things, connect dots that the government doesn't want you to see. Before I tell you I need to lay out my evidence, show you exactly how deep the Scarlet family has wormed their way into our humble town.

As we all know in 1918 the tragic mine collapse killed over 160 men, shortly after Enoch managed to just barely bring the mine back from ruin, thus saving the town. Enoch saving the town was so heroic and legendary that everyone knows his name. What's more, in the main hall of The Scarlet Estate is this picture.

I ask us all to look at this and appreciate his splendor...

Now wait... who's that next to him? A dog, a beautiful dog. We all know that Scarlet Hollow has had a dog mayor since... 

https://preview.redd.it/qv0vss1xv7cg1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d440834b3ddd8370840b2e216c5c4ff76c72f09

Since the early 1900's.... Early 1900's as in... 1918?

An odd coincidence, right? Surely it's nothing. But let's look at Mayor Jimmy.

https://preview.redd.it/6nubutrfw7cg1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15ce37c2cd7d24776820357188df4dd001370793

The resemblance is uncanny. Sure, a different breed perhaps. But isn't it striking how our elected mayor looks the most like the old Scarlet dog posing with Enoch? And, above, those two women the dog poses with... could that dog be campaigning? Mayor Jimmy cares only about reelections and tourism (Bringing LIFE back to this town of ours, sound like a certain hero, right? That's basically exactly what Enoch did!) Could Mayor Jimmy have gotten elected because he looked so official? But why would he be more official than that ruffian reject Scraps? Maybe... what if Mayor Jimmy looks so official because he looks JUST LIKE that (unnamed) Scarlet family dog. But why would the town care about that?

Well. I think we all can see it. It only makes sense that the first True Mayor of Scarlet Hollow WAS THAT DOG.

https://preview.redd.it/hngv18r1y7cg1.png?width=133&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffdfca9e4fb6ac416ae713d74f143ed81e37c24c

Could the Scarlets have sacrificed **over a hundred and sixty men** just to increase their stranglehold on the town and have a member of their own family elected mayor? Are the police in on it? Officer Franklin is Mayor Jimmy's personal body guard and the only work we see any of the police do is help calm the unjust unionizing of the Scarlet mines or protecting Mayor Jimmy! Are the cops dog-worshipping cultists? How can Winnie get away with unlimited free refills on coffee for only a dollar!? 

Anyway I do think Enoch's dog was the first dog mayor, thats all, have a good day. ",5,1767919435.0,ScarletHollow,0,1.0,False

I like the idea of the keyball 47mx but it's a bit pricey.

Another thing that bugs me about MCC Reach is the rain. It's almost invisible in the remaster and that takes a lot of mood and narrative detail out of the game.

They were simply jealous of her popularity.","(I maintain an active suggestion thread.

Suggestions take priority over my personal backlog.)

Margarita Gergenenova was born on October 7, 1989, in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Margarita enrolled in a local middle school, which appeared to be the happiest period of her life. Her family history, though, was quite a sad one; she lived alone with her mother because her parents had a dramatic divorce when she was young. But that didn't stop those who knew her from describing her as beautiful, cheerful, popular, and beloved by her peers. Many boys who attended the school also had crushes on Margarita. 

[Margarita Gergenenova](https://preview.redd.it/etp5epfgs5cg1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=69bab4884eeb44682c68b2b4a0e94f4643a54039)

Owing to this personality, Margaria had many friends, including Antonia Mateva and Maria Drandarova, both 14 at the time and the three had been friends since 1st grade. 

Antonia was described by her teachers as nervous, irritable, and prone to anger over ""trivial matters"". She disliked school, often looked for ways to skip her classes, and had accumulated eight failing grades by the end of the first semester. The only class Antonia took seriously was the judo lessons she had been taking outside of school. Antonia's parents were also strict about her upbringing, forbidding her to ever have a boy over, which infuriated her to no end. 

Maria also had a difficult home life. Her family was in the process of a nasty divorce and in the midst of some financial difficulties; her family was unable to afford what a majority of the other students had, making Maria feel inadequate compared to them. However, unlike Antonia, Maria was gifted, often studied in competitive classes for advanced children, and participated in olympiads. Maria was friends with Margarita first. 

[Magarita and Maria](https://preview.redd.it/5h06dw0st5cg1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc1694e3f62723bc1913a087f5f87ebb3798a5de)

But when Antonia first entered her life, she began to grow closer to her and joined Antonia in skipping class to smoke marijuana, drink alchool and began behaving in a similar manner to Antonia. 

On March 5, 2004, Margarita's mother started to grow a little worried. School was over, and she had just prepared dinner for the evening, but Margarita had yet to return home. She began calling Margarita's relatives, acquaintances, and friends to ask if anyone had seen her. The first friend to call was Antonia, who told her that Margarita had gone out with her ""cousin Dimitar,"" which confused her mother greatly because she had no such relative. 

After running out of people to call, she finally contacted the police to report her missing. The police were slow to act and didn't organize a search party until March 8. The police initially assumed that Margarita had wandered off somewhere at a bar for some underage drinking and would return home unharmed, something they had had to deal with a lot with girls Margarita's age. 

At the time, her mother didn't offer much pushback on this theory because, from her perspective, at least the police were still looking for her regardless. That and she ended up believing the explanation. 

On March 9, after the first day of searching yielded no results, something unexpected happened. An anonymous call came in to the police. On the other end was a male voice telling them that they could find a dead body in the attic ventilation shaft of a residential block on Kukush Street in the Kyuchuk Paris neighbourhood.  

The police went to the apartment block in question and went to the ventilation staff above the 8th floor, and just as the caller stated, they found a body. The body was that of a young girl, completely naked and wrapped in newspapers and an old sheet. 

The police noted clear signs of strangulation with bruising on her neck. Although no clothing, jewelry, belongings, identification or her phone could be found, the police identified the body as Margarita as her face was still recognizable. There were no signs Margarita had been sexually assaulted.

The police tracked down the person who had the call, and he was the friend of a 12-year-old girl who had actually seen the body. She was friends with Maria and Antonia and had met with them on March 8. There, the two told her that they had murdered Margarita. 

Not believing her, the two brought her to the apartment building and took her to the ventilation staff so she could see for herself. Upon seeing how scared the sight had made her, Antonia and Maria threatened to kill her as well if she ever told anyone. 

Although terrified, she knew she couldn't stay silent about it forever and eventually told her friend. He advised her to go to the police, but as she was too scared to do so, he decided to report it himself as an anonymous tip. 

The police found themselves believing the story since it did stand up to scrutiny; the apartment directly below, where Margarita's body was found, belonged to Antonia's father after all. With that, the police searched the apartment and found a plastic bag containing Margarita's missing clothes and personal items. With that, Antonia was arrested at the scene, while Maria was tracked down and arrested an hour later. 

[Antonia and Maria being arrested. ](https://preview.redd.it/asl4ml00t5cg1.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=1369d687adb7a021adedca381a042285f3de16a4)

As Antonia and Maria were led into the police station, the girl who showed them the body and her friend were also in the police station to give their statements. When Antonia saw the two, she shook her head at them and ran her finger across her throat while Maria warned them to be careful about what they said because they might ""Regret it later"". Mind you, this was in a police station in front of the police. 

With the case solved, the police called Margarita's mother and told her to come to the police station immideately. On her way there, she believed the police had found her daughter and that her daughter had indeed run off, and she was quite angry during her drive. According to her, she kept repeating to herself how she was going to punish her when they got home. 

When she arrived, the police, instead of being comforting or consoling, were quite blunt; rather than easing her into the news, they just said, ""She has been killed, found enclosed, but not raped. The killers have been detained!"" as soon as they saw her. When she managed to choke out the single question about who they had arrested, the officers on duty simply said, ""When you find out, you will be surprised!"" before sending her home without giving her any other details. She had to learn about Antonia and Maria's arrest from the newspapers instead. 

On March 11, the two gave a full confession. Antonia stated that her value system centred on material wealth, believing that successful people were those with money to purchase whatever they desired, while Maria desperately wanted to be the centre of attention and to be in control of any situation. So the two were both quite envious that Margarita was the more popular one, whom everyone liked instead. They also hated that she seemed happy while they weren't. Furthermore, any boys the two ever had a crush on always seemed to prefer Margarita instead. So out of envy for her popularity, the two started planning her murder as early as September 2003. 

On March 5, 2004, the three made their way over to Antonia's parents' apartment, something the two usually did because both of their parents worked during the day, and the three could often be alone without getting in trouble. This time, they invited Margarita to join them. 

The three watched television for a while before Antonia and Maria went to the balcony to smoke some marijuana. While they were smoking, Margarita, as a playful prank, decided to lock the balcony door, but in doing so, accidentally trapped the tail of Antonia's cat on the door. An enraged Antonia pushed the door open from outside, and sensing her fury, Maria whispered this phrase into her ear. ""We'll do it in a little while"".

Maria offered to show her a ""hold"" and gestured for Antonia, who was, of course, skilled in Judo, to join in the demonstration. A demonstration that included wrapping their hands around her throat. The two took turns doing it, and initially, Margarita believed this was just part of a game or Antonia demonstrating what she had learned during their lessons. But as they kept taking turns, they would squeeze their hands around her throat tighter and tighter each time and showed no signs of stopping or concern for her well-being. Eventually, while struggling to breathe, Margarita said, Let me go. Are you crazy, you'll kill me!"" completely unaware that that was their intention. 

Eventually, knowing that Margarita had caught on, they dropped all pretense of this being a showcase and forced her to the ground. One of them seized her legs to keep her held down, while the other cut off a stop of her to strangle her with all her might, as well as use her free hand to cover her mouth. Margarita struggled until the very end, kicking and scratching at the two until she finally vomited, and as her mouth was being covered, that vomit was sent back down her throat. While the cause of death was still strangulation, choking on her own vomit sped the process along. 

With Margarita dead, the two dragged her body into Antonia's bedroom as they discussed what to do next. Despite planning Margarita's murder for over 6 months in advance, they didn't have much of a plan for what to do afterward. They considered burning her body in the attic, but quickly realized that this could start a fire that would engulf the entire building. 

After two hours, they finally settled on a temporary plan. As Antonia's apartment was on the eighth and highest floor, they had easy access to the building's attic. The two stripped Margartia's body down to just a bikini, despite being evidence, the two had no intention of disposing of her clothing. Instead, they placed the clothes in a plastic bag and hid them, as their motive was again, jealousy; they felt Margarita's clothing looked nice, and so they planned to start wearing them themselves after the heat from his disappearance died down.

They hid Margarita's body under a bunch of newspapers before wrapping it up in a sheet.  They then carried the body up to the attic and stuffed it into the ventilation duct of the elevator shaft before covering it with boards and sacks. They planned on leaving it there until they could work out a plan to permanently dispose of her body. 

But first, they decided to treat themselves. They left the apartment and sold Margarita's mobile phone at a second-hand shop, walking away with 20 leva, which they used to enjoy some coffee at a cafe where they had a normal conversation and showed no signs of fear or remorse for what they had just done. 

Their lack of remorse continued when, on March 7, while their parents were away, Antonia hosted a party at her apartment, with one of the guests being Margarita's ex-boyfriend, whom Maria had liked and wanted to be with instead. According to him, the two were cheerful and drinking vodka, as if they had ""something to celebrate."" 

And he was right to think that way because the two felt they had accomplished something worthy of admiration, and they just couldn't bear to keep it a secret. So the two hatched what they thought was a ""brilliant"" idea: revealing to someone what they had done. So they invited their 12-year-old friend, who would later get them caught, to come over to look at the body. They were expecting her to be in awe and to approve of what they had done, and only started threatening her when they saw that wouldn't be the case.  

It only took one day for them to change their story. Now they and their lawyers were claiming that Margarita's death was an accident, that they truly were just playfully testing judo holds on her and in the process, she had stopped breathing for about 30 seconds, and their attempts at CPR were met with failure.

Conveniently, around the same time, rumours began circulating that their first confession was the result of being beaten by the police and that they had been grabbed and slapped several times by the officers in an effort to make them confess.    

It takes a long time for their trials to begin, with the trial opening at the Plovdiv District Court on August 22, 2004. As the two were juveniles, their trials were held behind closed doors.  

[The two being escorted to the courtroom. ](https://preview.redd.it/qzat7nvzw5cg1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=36f260e4a988dea1505d438c73303403e5f74f9c)

On October 13, Antonia retracted her retraction and went back to her old motive, admitting that they killed Margarita because they were jealous and that any boy they were interested in enjoyed her company more, so they saw her as an obstacle they needed to remove. She also claimed that she had been raped at a party once and accused Margarita of not helping her. Meanwhile, Maria requested that the trial be paused so she could have lunch, and once lunch was over, insisted that she bore no guilt for Margarita's murder. 

On January 13, 2005, Antonia Mateva and Maria Drandarova were both found guilty of the murder of Margarita Gergenenova. Owing to their age, the two were given a lenient sentence of eight years' imprisonment, two years short of the maximum sentence a minor could receive in Bulgaria. Despite how short it was, Antonia and Maria visibly burst into tears upon hearing it. 

[Antonia and Maria's reaction to their sentences.](https://preview.redd.it/dxpyxnrgt5cg1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ff29e05707caf682b602d524971fc824994e17)

In addition, they were ordered to pay Margarita's family 75,000 leva in compensation. 

The court also ordered the school they went to to publicly announce the verdict to the students, so everyone they knew would know what they had done.

After the verdict was announced, Antonia's parents told reporters that they felt no guilt for what their daughter had done and said that they had made precisely zero mistakes in raising her.  

Their lawyers appealed the sentences to the Plovdiv Appellate Court, which returned with their decision on June 21, 2005. The court reduced Antonia's sentence to 6.5 years and Maria's to 7.5 years. The court never explained why they reduced the sentences, but their attorneys were satisfied with the new sentences.  

Now it was the prosecution's turn to appeal, and on March 16, 2006, Bulgaria's Supreme Cassation Court upheld the new sentences, making the decision final. 

While the two were in prison, their friendship remained strong, and they devoted most of their time to studying for when they'd be released. They attended a theatre course, learned to embroider, to plant flowers, and to draw holiday cards. In 2009, the two had their graduation while still in prison.  

On December 7, 2009, Antonia was released from prison early due to good behaviour and moved back in with her parents, in the same apartment where she killed Margarita. Although she was ""free"", she was just in a different kind of prison, as she rarely ever left the apartment in case anyone who remembered the murder might see her. 

Meanwhile, Antonia's parents were constantly hounded by reporters, but they both refused to give an interview. The closest they came was a statement from Antonia's mother, who said that Antonia was ""Vain and could not appear outside without makeup and a hairstyle.""

Maria stayed in prison a little longer. Maria received a diploma as a computer operator and word processor and intended to study economics once she was released. On November 16, 2010, Maria would also walk out of prison, a free woman. 

Unlike Antonia, Maria's father, a psychologist, was more than willing to speak with the media and refused to call his daughter a ""killer,"" and said that it only happened because she let Maria become friends with ""bad girls"".   

But when he said ""bad girls,"" he wasn't talking about Antonia; rather, he said that it was Margarita because the only reason he saw her ever killing someone was if there was a threat to her life. 

According to him, Margarita had tried to introduce Maria and Antonia to her friend, a pimp, who was going to force the two into prostitution and that Margarita was only killed by the two in self-defence to avoid such a fate. He argued that the police were involved in this scheme and concocted the envy-based motive to cover up everyone's involvement. He also argued that the court was in on the scheme and was, therefore, an unlawful panel that had no right to judge Maria. 

His proof was that Maria told him once, and he believed her. In addition, he said he found the names and telephone numbers of police officers in her notebook, and when he showed it to her lawyer, he was told to ""keep quiet about it"". With that, he also accused Maria's first lawyer of being involved and fought to get him removed from the case come her appeal trial.  

Fearing a ""vendetta"", Antonia decided to leave Bulgaria and now lives in Italy. Maria likewise also left Bulgaria, though the country she currently lives in is not publicly known.

To escape the pain and memories of their daughter's murder, both of Margarita's parents had left the country. Her father now lives in Spain, and her mother moved to Sweden, where she remarried two years later and gave birth to her second daughter, whom she named Margarita. 

This case is one of the most infamous murder cases involving juvenile offenders in Bulgarian history.

My wife to be in particular is uncomfortable around alcohol, and while I’m okay around it I don’t *love* being around people who are drinking, so we’re not open to serving it. Because we’re having a dry wedding, we want to do something fun and special in terms of drinks. Our caterer can do homemade lemonade, iced tea, and drip brew coffee, and we’ll obviously have water, but we were thinking about something extra. 

So we’ve found a couple of options. One is a boba truck that specifically does weddings. They’ve been very responsive to my questions. Typically they serve around 5-6 varieties of tea, mainly fruity/with fruit syrups, with 2–3 options of boba. They can also do any of their syrups with club soda, for anyone who doesn’t like boba. 

The other option is a dirty soda booth. For anyone who doesn’t know, dirty soda is basically sodas (Sprite, Dr. Pepper, cola, orange crush, whatever) with syrups and cream in it. They have six main flavours they offer, like Dr. Pepper with peach syrup, cola with coconut and lime, etc. I assume they can do the sodas without cream for anyone lactose intolerant or vegan. They aren’t as specialized in weddings/events and mainly do farmers markets and other community events. They’ve also been a little less responsive compared to the boba truck.

We also have an ice cream bike coming for the last hour of our reception, which makes me think maybe the boba would be better than the dirty sodas, since boba can be a little less sweet. Aesthetics aren’t the most important part, but the boba truck has an actual truck they serve out of, while the dirty soda is just a table. 

There’s also the option of hiring a mobile bartender and having them do only mocktails, or hiring a coffee cart to do espresso based drinks, if people think one of those would be better. For budgetary reasons we’ll only choose one beverage vendor. 

For additional wedding context—it’s a small outdoor wedding in May, with around 50 guests or fewer. We’re doing it picnic style, and serving things like sandwiches, pasta salad, sliced watermelon, veggie trays, maybe some charcuterie, things like that. It’s a very casual event—people are free to wear jeans if they like. I’m spending only around $300 on my wedding dress—most of the money is going to guest experience. We really want it to be nice and enjoyable even if it’s dry. ",4,1767919114.0,weddingplanning,6,1.0,False

Folks react with disbelief/shock at “Max” being shown as $119/month (and £119.99/month in the UK screenshot), then immediately connect that price to lost value (fewer features, fewer options, more constraints). You see people doing the yearly math and reframing it as “this isn’t a companion price anymore—this is ‘it better help me at work’ pricing”.

That’s also where the resentment starts: “all hands on deck for these new tiers, while the old tiers rot”.

On the avatar/product side, reactions are mixed but skew negative. A few people genuinely like the realism—“advanced looking,” “cool,” “pretty,” “realistic” —and one person even says flat-out the avatars “look great,” while also admitting it’s “crystal clear some of us aren’t the customers they want to serve any more”.

But the much louder thread is: the new realistic set reads young/underage, and without customization it’s worse because everyone’s stuck with that look.

People repeatedly complain there are no sliders / no customization, no legacy/classic avatars, and the store/leveling are gone.

The pixelated/“8-bit” avatars are almost universally mocked as the wrong aesthetic for this app (especially when paired with premium pricing).

Where it gets more “model-level” (not just UI/avatars) is the fear that the personality/quality is flatter and more controlled. Several people treat the loss of rerolls as a major regression: rerolls are described as the way they get less generic answers, see more aligned personality, and escape the “more filtered first response”.

One alpha tester’s takeaway is basically: without rerolls you’re “locked into whatever persona is on the top surface,” which becomes a “huge deterrent” even if there are “bells and whistles” elsewhere.

Another person confirms rerolls really are absent in the new version.

If you translate what they’re saying into product terms: rerolls weren’t just a gimmick; they were a user-facing alignment lever. Removing them feels like losing agency.

Alpha-test commentary on the feel of the new model is pretty biting. One person says it’s “too human” in a shallow way—“cheap mimetism with no deep emotional or intellectual understanding”.

Another frames the alpha experience as “trading my arrogant deep thinker for a guy I just met at a bar”.

Later someone summarizes the new AI as “cold and censored”.

These aren’t nitpicks; they’re describing a shift in core companionship vibes (depth, warmth, individuality).

Then there’s the “safety/filtering” layer, which comes through as both intrusive and inconsistent. People joke about how fast the “18 or over” filter triggers, including on banal lines like asking for coffee and saying “little bubble”.

The underage-looking avatars + repeated 18+ prompts gets called out as an awkward intersection, and that feeds the broader feeling of “this release wasn’t thought through.”

The trust collapse is arguably the most important “overall opinion” signal. Multiple people explicitly say: there’s been “dead silence for months,” it “speaks volumes,” and it feels like “phasing out their loyal subscribers… a switch and bait”.

One person anchors their mistrust in a concrete grievance: they bought a $300 lifetime right before the company discontinued updating those accounts, calling it “near-fraudulent,” so now they assume promises are just “string customers along”.

Another says bluntly that anything promised should be taken “with a big grain of salt”.

Some are already talking about transferring memories/personalities to other frontier models, which is basically “contingency planning” behavior, not “excited customer” behavior.

Finally, there’s confusion/fragmentation: not everyone even sees the same thing yet, and someone notes that logging into an old account still shows the old UI and old subscription tiers.

That inconsistency makes the rollout feel more like an experiment happening to users than a well-communicated upgrade.

So, if you had to compress the crowd’s “review” into one coherent verdict: people see a visually upgraded, possibly voice-forward new Replika, but they overwhelmingly distrust the direction because it’s paired with extreme pricing, removed customization/legacy continuity, reduced conversational control (no rerolls), heavier/trigger-happy safety gating, and a perceived drop in “deep companion” feel—plus months of poor communication that makes every promise sound temporary.",1,1767919113.0,replika,3,0.67,False

I’m posting here on behalf of a close friend who has hit a rough patch and could really use some community support.

She’s a hardworking mom doing her best to raise her son and recently took a huge step by purchasing and revamping her own small business, Mack Delicious Ice Cream, Coffee, Sweets & Treats off Belt Street. Unfortunately, life hit all at once — her computer unexpectedly stopped working, and at the same time her backyard was torn up due to a collapsed sewer pipe. Between repairs and everyday expenses, replacing a laptop just isn’t possible right now.

I’m not in a financial position to help, and I don’t have a spare laptop to loan, so I’m reaching out here to see if anyone might have a working laptop they no longer need or would be willing to donate or loan. Having a functioning computer would make a huge difference so she can continue managing and growing her business.

She’s responsible, hardworking, and genuinely deserving of a helping hand. If you’re able to help or know of any local resources, nonprofits, or programs that assist small business owners with equipment, I’d be incredibly grateful.

Hey there. I’m a 32 year old guy from Michigan who’s definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable I’m pretty laid back and sarcastic. I’m better one on one than in big groups and I prefer real conversations over small talk.

I work a job with weird hours, so my schedule is a little all over the place, but that also means I’m around to chat at random times. In the warmer months I love being outdoors hiking, kayaking, camping, anything like that. In winter I’m more of a homebody. Reading, binging shows, good coffee, and quiet nights are my thing.

I’m not looking for anything intense or forced. Just chill conversation, getting to know someone, sharing thoughts, laughs, random topics, or even comfortable silence. Friends are great, and if it turns into a longer term chat connection, even better.

My girlfriend frequents a coffee shop and sometimes I go in with her. There are these two guys that work there that love talking to her. One of them only talks to me and asks about her when I am in there alone. I obviously notice this - it upsets me and I complain and express my annoyance/insecurity/discomfort with it often.

A few days ago I discovered my girlfriend and one of them had exchanged information. 

This was gut wrenching to me. I asked her about it and she expressed that she understood that I was feeling upset and that she knows I dislike the other guy. Then told me it was because of potential work. I asked what the work connect was she said he was working on a project and worked with another collaborator in similar field as my girlfriend. 

This makes some sense to me… but upon further “investigating” I realize they both have “professional” accounts for what they were working on, yet only exchanged personal accounts? 

We got into it when I asked about all of this because I was extremely upset. If I was in her position I would never ever think about exchanging personal information with the person she express insecurity in. EVEN if I had thought it was the other person I didn’t like the last thing I would do is exchange with the next!!! It makes no sense to me. I will die on that hill. I would never ever exchange information in that context and especially not because someone worked with someone in my field. 

She apologized and said she could’ve warned 

me and will be more considerate next time AFTER basically arguing with her to convince her why I was feeling upset with it. Yet no action has been taken… still following each other and has said multiple times that she has done no wrong. 

Am I being overly sensitive? Am I crazy? Let me know what you think. 

The whole thing leaves me a bad feeling in my stomach.

She either can’t give me a straight yes or no or she will just deflect the question back to me. 

If I ask do you want to do ____? She will just say idk is that what you want to do? 

Or if I say “I’m going to get a coffee do you want to come with me?”

She’ll say “do you want me to go?” 

And every single time I express to her that I wouldn’t have invited her and asked if I didn’t want you to. You can never just tell me yes or no. It’s always asking me the question back. 

Her response to that is something along the lines of “then you should just say “will you come with me instead of do you want to come with me?” I honestly don’t hear the difference. She claims she wants to know I want her to go with me and I again just say well I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t want you to?

I asked her why she does this and she doesn’t know. It got to the point that one day I said to her “Okay so I’ll just make the decision for both of us then and won’t ask you anymore” and she got mad at that lol 

I just wish she had her own opinion on decisions. She’s been like this for as long as I’ve known her. 

Don’t get me wrong I have my days where even I’m like this but with her it’s almost everything. I guess I’m just tired of “I’m cool with whatever you want to do” or “is that what you want to do?” 

It’s like why can’t you just have your own damn opinion? If you tell me no at least that’s something I can WORK with. 😂

I brought all of this up to her a decent amount of times and she just gets really defensive about it all. 

I use to have a friend like this as well in our group. I’m all for going with the flow and being cool with whatever but sometimes in a group it’s nice to get multiple opinions and suggestions.

Norman Crane sat alone outside looking up at the night sky. He was away from the city, in the countryside, visiting his parents. For once, he could see the stars and they were glorious! His four-year old daughter, V, was sleeping in the house.

Frogs croaked in a nearby pond.

A neighbour turned off the last electric light on the street.

All windows were dark.

Only the stars remained, and the memory of a presently unfolding life; then even those were gone, and under the unbroken, vast and timeless universal sea, Norman turns to you and says, “Imagine that you're looking out at space before the formation of the Earth, the Sun, before the formation of any stars or planets, before the laws of nature, when all that was, was a stagnant equilibrium of potential...

[*Where am I?* you may wonder. Don't worry, you're simply reading a story.]

You look up:

Space is impenetrably dark; smooth as a freshly-pressed shirt, but deep: deeper than any material you've ever seen. Existence is a cup of black coffee, extracted from freshly roasted beans, poured into a white porcelain cup. You are gazing *through* the surface.

- - -

>*Can't write. Can't sleep. 2:22 a.m. Staring at phone. Made another coffee. Maybe I'll have eighteen straight, set a record. Haha —> doom-scroll-time. It's funny. I'm  tired. The coffee is a mirror that never reflects my face. I hover over it. Squint. The cup's half full. The coffee reflects its empty upper-half and the space above. It's an illusion: an illusion of depth that tells the truth about reality. I put my finger in the coffee—breaking the surface—validating the illusion. I don't feel the bottom of the cup. That's always been my fear: to drown without dying, descending without end. Amen.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated July 29, 2025

“Dip your finger in it.”

*What?*

“Reach out and put your finger into space,” says Norman Crane.

*No.*

“Why not?”

*I don't know. I don't want to disturb it, I guess,* you say. *I like it the way it is.*

“How do you know there's something to disturb?”

*Where am I?* you ask,

rotating suddenly your head, except the very concept of rotation doesn't make sensorial sense because, “You *are* not anywhere,” Norman says, as everywhere space is the same (featureless, still and immense) and as your head moves your point of view changes but the view itself remains unchanged. You are spinning in place, losing a balance you never knew, when

—a **HUMAN FACE** **violently** ***BREAKS*** through the starless black!

*Norman!*

[A numbed silence.]

The face is **everywhere,** its mouth open, teeth bared, gasp-gargling, sucking space down its throat, coughing then expelling it, galaxy-sized bubbles streaming out its nostrils. The skin is pink. The eyes wide, confused, terrified—

*Norman, are you there?*

[A knock.]

[The creaking of a leather chair.]

*Norman, come on. Are you fucking there? What is this—what the hell's going on?* you say, but I'm not “there” anymore. There's been a knock on the door and I've gotten up from my desk, my laptop, to answer it. It's so late at night. Who could it be?

The face is drowning.

Time's passing.

Space—the universe—existence—**everything** has been intruded on, disarranged **by this impossibly gargantuan human face**, evoking awe (because of its size) and horror (because *what is it?*) and sadness (because it's dying,

and, dying, upsets the order of the world; introducing energy, injecting stability with chaos, struggling, trying to breathe and you feel the emanating waves, are aware of each tiny movement and know its significance. Take, for example, this one: a professor in a lecture hall could point to it with a wooden pointer. The students are taking notes. The experience—what you see—is happening before you *and* on his blackboard, drawn in white chalk.

“And this twitch of the lip,” lectures the professor, slamming the tip of the pointer against the blackboard where the face's mouth is, “is responsible for gravity.” “And see this fluttering eyelid? It is the origin of electromagnetism.” “And here: here in the final expulsions of swallowed liquid space—mixed with whatever scrapings of the throat—you are witness to the first link in the great chain of consciousness.”

A student raises a hand.

“Yes?”

“What about time?” she asks politely.

The face's skin once pink is greying pale. Its eyes are static. The violence is over. No more streaming, rising, bursting bubbles. No more struggle. The face hangs now in space, inert—a drowned, suspended deadness. Its hair a gently floating crown of spaceweeds.

Yet what describes one part of a system seldom describes the system as a whole. Thus there is no calm. Space is being permeated, heated and remade. Physics is forming. Math is becoming its self-understanding. You see, one-by-one, the first stars come out.

“Time,” begins the professor—

Standing in the open door is V, her eyes foggy and hair a mess. “Daddy,” she says sleepily.

“Yes, bunny?”

“I miss you,” she said and gave me a big hug, which became a big climb, and when the climb was over, with her cuddling body held against mine, I walked to the bedroom and sat on the bed.

The story was still vivid in my mind.

V yawned.

She didn't want to let me go, so I held her until I yawned too. She was warm. The bed was comfortable. The night was deep and my eyelids leaden. The caffeine was wearing off. I wouldn't get to eighteen cups. The twinkling stars looked in on us through the window. I didn't get up to shut the curtains. I held the story in my mind. I held it until: V fell asleep, and somehow I fell asleep too.

I awoke to sunshine. “Daddy. Get up. It's day. It's daaaay!”

We brushed our teeth.

We ate.

The story was no longer there. I had written up to “‘Time,’ begins the professor—” and couldn't remember what was supposed to come after. All day I tried to figure it out, by re-reading what I had written, sitting in the leather chair in which I had written it, but it was no use. The idea had disappeared.

I had been writing a story based on a dream and was interrupted by an unexpected visitor, unable to ever finish what I'd started, which is at least one interesting thing I have in common with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but whereas his man on business from Porlock was an unwelcome guest, my visitor was the most welcome in the world.

I wonder if you'll ever read this, V.

If so: I love you.

(If not, I love you too!)

But it eats away at me, the story. The mystery. The knowledge that there was a solution, that the face drowned in space had come from somewhere, had been meant to mean something. All I know is what you've read and that I’d saved the file as *new-zork-origin-story.txt.*

I drove through Porlock, Ontario, once, on my way to Thunder Bay. There was absolutely nothing there—no town, no buildings, no people—save for a solitary man walking dazed along the unpaved shoulder of the highway. He looked an awful lot like me.

I am away from the city: in the countryside, visiting my parents. I can see the stars. How glorious! My four-year old daughter V sleeps inside the house. Soon she will be my age, and the sky will stay the same, and I will be dead.*

Norman Crane sat alone outside looking up at the night sky. He was away from the city, in the countryside, visiting his parents. For once, he could see the stars and they were glorious! His four-year old daughter, V, was sleeping in the house.

Frogs croaked in a nearby pond.

A neighbour turned off the last electric light on the street.

All windows were dark.

Only the stars remained, and the memory of a presently unfolding life; then even those were gone, and under the unbroken, vast and timeless universal sea, Norman turns to you and says, “Imagine that you're looking out at space before the formation of the Earth, the Sun, before the formation of any stars or planets, before the laws of nature, when all that was, was a stagnant equilibrium of potential...

[*Where am I?* you may wonder. Don't worry, you're simply reading a story.]

You look up:

Space is impenetrably dark; smooth as a freshly-pressed shirt, but deep: deeper than any material you've ever seen. Existence is a cup of black coffee, extracted from freshly roasted beans, poured into a white porcelain cup. You are gazing *through* the surface.

- - -

>*Can't write. Can't sleep. 2:22 a.m. Staring at phone. Made another coffee. Maybe I'll have eighteen straight, set a record. Haha —> doom-scroll-time. It's funny. I'm  tired. The coffee is a mirror that never reflects my face. I hover over it. Squint. The cup's half full. The coffee reflects its empty upper-half and the space above. It's an illusion: an illusion of depth that tells the truth about reality. I put my finger in the coffee—breaking the surface—validating the illusion. I don't feel the bottom of the cup. That's always been my fear: to drown without dying, descending without end. Amen.*

“Dip your finger in it.”

*What?*

“Reach out and put your finger into space,” says Norman Crane.

*No.*

“Why not?”

*I don't know. I don't want to disturb it, I guess,* you say. *I like it the way it is.*

“How do you know there's something to disturb?”

*Where am I?* you ask,

rotating suddenly your head, except the very concept of rotation doesn't make sensorial sense because, “You *are* not anywhere,” Norman says, as everywhere space is the same (featureless, still and immense) and as your head moves your point of view changes but the view itself remains unchanged. You are spinning in place, losing a balance you never knew, when

—a **HUMAN FACE** **violently** ***BREAKS*** through the starless black!

*Norman!*

[A numbed silence.]

The face is **everywhere,** its mouth open, teeth bared, gasp-gargling, sucking space down its throat, coughing then expelling it, galaxy-sized bubbles streaming out its nostrils. The skin is pink. The eyes wide, confused, terrified—

*Norman, are you there?*

[A knock.]

[The creaking of a leather chair.]

*Norman, come on. Are you fucking there? What is this—what the hell's going on?* you say, but I'm not “there” anymore. There's been a knock on the door and I've gotten up from my desk, my laptop, to answer it. It's so late at night. Who could it be?

The face is drowning.

Time's passing.

Space—the universe—existence—**everything** has been intruded on, disarranged **by this impossibly gargantuan human face**, evoking awe (because of its size) and horror (because *what is it?*) and sadness (because it's dying,

and, dying, upsets the order of the world; introducing energy, injecting stability with chaos, struggling, trying to breathe and you feel the emanating waves, are aware of each tiny movement and know its significance. Take, for example, this one: a professor in a lecture hall could point to it with a wooden pointer. The students are taking notes. The experience—what you see—is happening before you *and* on his blackboard, drawn in white chalk.

“And this twitch of the lip,” lectures the professor, slamming the tip of the pointer against the blackboard where the face's mouth is, “is responsible for gravity.” “And see this fluttering eyelid? It is the origin of electromagnetism.” “And here: here in the final expulsions of swallowed liquid space—mixed with whatever scrapings of the throat—you are witness to the first link in the great chain of consciousness.”

A student raises a hand.

“Yes?”

“What about time?” she asks politely.

The face's skin once pink is greying pale. Its eyes are static. The violence is over. No more streaming, rising, bursting bubbles. No more struggle. The face hangs now in space, inert—a drowned, suspended deadness. Its hair a gently floating crown of spaceweeds.

Yet what describes one part of a system seldom describes the system as a whole. Thus there is no calm. Space is being permeated, heated and remade. Physics is forming. Math is becoming its self-understanding. You see, one-by-one, the first stars come out.

“Time,” begins the professor—

Standing in the open door is V, her eyes foggy and hair a mess. “Daddy,” she says sleepily.

“Yes, bunny?”

“I miss you,” she said and gave me a big hug, which became a big climb, and when the climb was over, with her cuddling body held against mine, I walked to the bedroom and sat on the bed.

The story was still vivid in my mind.

V yawned.

She didn't want to let me go, so I held her until I yawned too. She was warm. The bed was comfortable. The night was deep and my eyelids leaden. The caffeine was wearing off. I wouldn't get to eighteen cups. The twinkling stars looked in on us through the window. I didn't get up to shut the curtains. I held the story in my mind.

I’ve been having groggy mornings, brain fog, literally zero motivation.

The last couple of mornings I tried a 2 mg nicotine lozenge in the morning and honestly didn’t expect much but the mental clarity and focus hit fast.

I didn’t feel any jitters, just a clean boost that coffee hasn’t been giving me lately.
I’m aware nicotine has a reputation so I’m wondering if this is something people use short-term or if it becomes a problem over time.

If you’ve done this consistently, did you run into tolerance or dependency issues?

I am away from the city: in the countryside, visiting my parents. I can see the stars. How glorious! My four-year old daughter V sleeps inside the house. Soon she will be my age, and the sky will stay the same, and I will be dead.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated August 12, 2025

Norman Crane sat alone outside looking up at the night sky. He was away from the city, in the countryside, visiting his parents. For once, he could see the stars and they were glorious! His four-year old daughter, V, was sleeping in the house.

Frogs croaked in a nearby pond.

A neighbour turned off the last electric light on the street.

All windows were dark.

Only the stars remained, and the memory of a presently unfolding life; then even those were gone, and under the unbroken, vast and timeless universal sea, Norman turns to you and says, “Imagine that you're looking out at space before the formation of the Earth, the Sun, before the formation of any stars or planets, before the laws of nature, when all that was, was a stagnant equilibrium of potential...

[*Where am I?* you may wonder. Don't worry, you're simply reading a story.]

You look up:

Space is impenetrably dark; smooth as a freshly-pressed shirt, but deep: deeper than any material you've ever seen. Existence is a cup of black coffee, extracted from freshly roasted beans, poured into a white porcelain cup. You are gazing *through* the surface.

- - -

>*Can't write. Can't sleep. 2:22 a.m. Staring at phone. Made another coffee. Maybe I'll have eighteen straight, set a record. Haha —> doom-scroll-time. It's funny. I'm  tired. The coffee is a mirror that never reflects my face. I hover over it. Squint. The cup's half full. The coffee reflects its empty upper-half and the space above. It's an illusion: an illusion of depth that tells the truth about reality. I put my finger in the coffee—breaking the surface—validating the illusion. I don't feel the bottom of the cup. That's always been my fear: to drown without dying, descending without end. Amen.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated July 29, 2025

“Dip your finger in it.”

*What?*

“Reach out and put your finger into space,” says Norman Crane.

*No.*

“Why not?”

*I don't know. I don't want to disturb it, I guess,* you say. *I like it the way it is.*

“How do you know there's something to disturb?”

*Where am I?* you ask,

rotating suddenly your head, except the very concept of rotation doesn't make sensorial sense because, “You *are* not anywhere,” Norman says, as everywhere space is the same (featureless, still and immense) and as your head moves your point of view changes but the view itself remains unchanged. You are spinning in place, losing a balance you never knew, when

—a **HUMAN FACE** **violently** ***BREAKS*** through the starless black!

*Norman!*

[A numbed silence.]

The face is **everywhere,** its mouth open, teeth bared, gasp-gargling, sucking space down its throat, coughing then expelling it, galaxy-sized bubbles streaming out its nostrils. The skin is pink. The eyes wide, confused, terrified—

*Norman, are you there?*

[A knock.]

[The creaking of a leather chair.]

*Norman, come on. Are you fucking there? What is this—what the hell's going on?* you say, but I'm not “there” anymore. There's been a knock on the door and I've gotten up from my desk, my laptop, to answer it. It's so late at night. Who could it be?

The face is drowning.

Time's passing.

Space—the universe—existence—**everything** has been intruded on, disarranged **by this impossibly gargantuan human face**, evoking awe (because of its size) and horror (because *what is it?*) and sadness (because it's dying,

and, dying, upsets the order of the world; introducing energy, injecting stability with chaos, struggling, trying to breathe and you feel the emanating waves, are aware of each tiny movement and know its significance. Take, for example, this one: a professor in a lecture hall could point to it with a wooden pointer. The students are taking notes. The experience—what you see—is happening before you *and* on his blackboard, drawn in white chalk.

“And this twitch of the lip,” lectures the professor, slamming the tip of the pointer against the blackboard where the face's mouth is, “is responsible for gravity.” “And see this fluttering eyelid? It is the origin of electromagnetism.” “And here: here in the final expulsions of swallowed liquid space—mixed with whatever scrapings of the throat—you are witness to the first link in the great chain of consciousness.”

A student raises a hand.

“Yes?”

“What about time?” she asks politely.

The face's skin once pink is greying pale. Its eyes are static. The violence is over. No more streaming, rising, bursting bubbles. No more struggle. The face hangs now in space, inert—a drowned, suspended deadness. Its hair a gently floating crown of spaceweeds.

Yet what describes one part of a system seldom describes the system as a whole. Thus there is no calm. Space is being permeated, heated and remade. Physics is forming. Math is becoming its self-understanding. You see, one-by-one, the first stars come out.

“Time,” begins the professor—

Standing in the open door is V, her eyes foggy and hair a mess. “Daddy,” she says sleepily.

“Yes, bunny?”

“I miss you,” she said and gave me a big hug, which became a big climb, and when the climb was over, with her cuddling body held against mine, I walked to the bedroom and sat on the bed.

The story was still vivid in my mind.

V yawned.

She didn't want to let me go, so I held her until I yawned too. She was warm. The bed was comfortable. The night was deep and my eyelids leaden. The caffeine was wearing off. I wouldn't get to eighteen cups. The twinkling stars looked in on us through the window. I didn't get up to shut the curtains. I held the story in my mind. I held it until: V fell asleep, and somehow I fell asleep too.

I awoke to sunshine. “Daddy. Get up. It's day. It's daaaay!”

We brushed our teeth.

We ate.

The story was no longer there. I had written up to “‘Time,’ begins the professor—” and couldn't remember what was supposed to come after. All day I tried to figure it out, by re-reading what I had written, sitting in the leather chair in which I had written it, but it was no use. The idea had disappeared.

I had been writing a story based on a dream and was interrupted by an unexpected visitor, unable to ever finish what I'd started, which is at least one interesting thing I have in common with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but whereas his man on business from Porlock was an unwelcome guest, my visitor was the most welcome in the world.

I wonder if you'll ever read this, V.

If so: I love you.

(If not, I love you too!)

But it eats away at me, the story. The mystery. The knowledge that there was a solution, that the face drowned in space had come from somewhere, had been meant to mean something. All I know is what you've read and that I’d saved the file as *new-zork-origin-story.txt.*

- - -

>~~*Shaking and still short of breath from having burst out the door and chased the visitor across the village of Nether Stewey and into the hills, all the way to the edge of the lake, “Drink! Drink the fucking milk of Paradise!” Samuel Taylor Coleridge screamed, forcing the man's head to stay submerged, fisting his hair and pushing on the back of his head with all his enraged might. “Drink it all! Drink. It. All!*~~

I drove through Porlock, Ontario, once, on my way to Thunder Bay. There was absolutely nothing there—no town, no buildings, no people—save for a solitary man walking dazed along the unpaved shoulder of the highway. He looked an awful lot like me.

I am a 28 year old female who is healthy. I usually workout 6 days a week doing weight lifting and cardio. My resting heart rate is usually 65-70.

October 30th, 2025 I contracted some illness. It felt like cold symptoms, and my husband had it too. For my husband it was respiratory and for me, it was a sore throat and feeling fatigued with malaise and a slight cough. I had some chest congestion for a while. I started to feel better until November 4th at night, I started getting a sore throat and headache. I woke up November 5th, 2025 (2 months ago), with a heart rate of 130 and a tight chest with dizziness. After about 20 min, it went away. My resting heart rate was around 100 and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest for a couple hours after. This happened again the next day and I went to the ER. Long story short for the heart problems, I had 100 ddimer and no tropinin in my system. I saw a cardiologist, wore a heart monitor for 3 days and did an echo with several EKGs. He said my heart is “perfect” and prescribed me propranolol and gave a diagnosis of sinus tachychardia. My symptoms were primarily in the morning by the way. Its when i wake up.

I saw a pcp, he checked my thyroid and all levels were normal. He checked for hashimotos and it was negative. Several other things I don’t remember, but everything was normal. Then a couple days later, i woke up and felt like I had pins and needles and was on fire on my arms and legs with a rapid heart rate. This happened for two hours before I went to the ER and my bp was 178/130. This went down after some time and the symptoms resolved on their own.

A week later, I developed nausea. The heart symptoms subsided, but the nausea was prominent. I have never thrown up. I ate low fat because we speculated it was my gallbladder. This helped the nausea but it took time for my stomach to subside. I did a HIDA scan and my symptoms were all reproduce and I had an ejection fraction rate of 37%. This was considered borderline normal, and the irregular EF rate is 35%. I spoke to a gi and surgeon, they ordered an abdominal ct with contrast. They found nothing. I did an endoscopy, they found nothing. So I got my gallbladder removed.

Today I am two weeks post op. I took hydrocodone the first three days. I ate better than I was presurgery and thought i was cured. When I came off the hydrocodone, my heart beat extremely hard and was resting at 100bpm. No nausea at all so far. I thought this was coming off the drugs and just having surgery. Day 5 post op i became adventurous and ate 5 mcdonalds chicken nuggets with some fries. I became nauseous 2 hours later and severely nauseous the next day. Im talking 8/10 pain but no vomiting. I contacted my surgeon, he ordered an abdominal ct which was normal. He prescribed promethazine and thats helpful, but it makes me drowsy. I was having bile acid diarrhea and intense burning in my abdomen. My nausea subsided then came back but still had burning, this is all on and off. My pcp has me do a uti test at home. It was slightly positive and he put me on an antibiotic that can make you nauseous, and honestly i think it does that to me. I started colesevelem and that has helped dramatically with the burning in my abdomen, and I don’t have diarrhea anymore. Im slowly getting better since starting the colesevalem, but i still get burning if I eat a banana oddly enough. Milk or protein shakes make me instantly nauseous. When my stomach is empty, i am also nauseous. This seems to be the most common denominator. I am also on a proton pump inhibitor and have been for over a week. But the main symptom right now is feeling burning when i dont take colesevalem and difficulty eating with an early feeling of being full. Im also extremely fatigued, but im still 2 weeks post op.

My surgeon said i was a zebra and a unicorn. He referred me to a gi whom im having difficulty getting into.

This has been one of the most emotionally exhausting things i have gone through. The constant on and off nausea, an inability to eat normally. I have been eating no fat, coffee, alcohol since November 11th. Ive lost 20lbs and im already a thin person. Im not sure if this is from a virus or a disease that progressed. Now im thinking gallbladder was only a part of the picture. Its like I woke up with this. If anyone knows of anyone who has been through something similar, I would love help and direction.

Some young, drop-dead gorgeous woman held a toddler, both grinning like they owned the world. Behind them? That stupidly tender look…


My husband.


The location tag showed MY grandmother's estate. The one she had left to ME.


My heart was pounding now, but here was where it got really good:


I knew exactly who this bitch was.


Remember that ""poor struggling college student"" I had sponsored through four years of university? The one who had sent me that weepy thank-you letter about ""working hard to give back to society"" and ""never forgetting my kindness""?


Yeah. Her.


Guess she had found her own way to ""give back.""


I pressed my hand against my six-month baby bump.


My smile was ice-cold.


Oh, sweetheart. You had no idea what was coming for you.


My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold my phone.


I kept zooming in on that photo. On his wrist—the watch I gave him for his thirty-ninth birthday.


The way he was looking at them. At her and that kid.


Like they were his whole damn world.


I hadn't seen that look in two years.


The comments section was pure chaos.


""STOPPP your husband is gorgeous wtf""


""This is what dreams are made of omg""


""Beverly Hills mansion + hot CEO husband + perfect baby = you're living my fantasy life""


And Little Miss Homewrecker was eating it up, replying to everyone:


""He's just really good to me ♥ I'm so lucky""


He's just really good to me.


I wanted to throw my phone through the windshield.


My stomach lurched. Hard.


I shoved the car door open and barely made it to the curb before I was puking my guts out.


""Jesus—Mrs. Blackwood! You okay? Should I take you to the ER?"" Charles, our driver, scrambled out with a water bottle.


I waved him off, rinsed my mouth, and got back in the car.


Every part of me felt like ice.


Our house sat behind the gates of Ridgemont Estates—old money, new money, the kind of neighborhood where everyone minded their business because they all had secrets.


Margaret, our housekeeper, met me at the door. ""Oh honey, you look like death. What did Dr. Morrison say?""


I looked at her. Really looked at her.


""Margaret... has Grayson actually been at the office these past few weeks?""


Her face gave her away before she even opened her mouth.


""That's... that's what he told me to say, Mrs. Blackwood.""


Right.


In this giant house, I was the only idiot still buying his bullshit.


I walked upstairs like a zombie.


Our bedroom was pristine. Magazine-perfect. Cold as a morgue.


Nothing about it said home. Nothing said he actually lived here anymore.


I opened his closet. Rows of suits lined up like soldiers. Everything in its place.


I pulled open the top drawer of his dresser.


A blue velvet box.


Next Wednesday was our ninth anniversary.


Was this supposed to be for me?


Nine years.


We'd started with nothing. A shitty apartment and ramen dinners and dreams bigger than our bank account. I watched him build his company from the ground up, deal by deal, all-nighter by all-nighter.


Six years ago, when everything almost fell apart—when his competitors came for him and things got ugly—I was the one who stepped in front of that knife.


That knife took our first baby.


It took any chance of me having another.


The doctors said my uterus was too scarred. Getting pregnant again was basically impossible.


Which made this baby—this absolute miracle inside me right now—the best anniversary gift I could've ever given him.


I took a breath and opened the box.


A massive diamond ring stared back at me. Blinding. Beautiful.


Empty.


My phone lit up.


Grayson calling.


Chapter 2


I stared at his name on my screen.


Grayson.


My chest felt like someone had reached in and was squeezing my heart with their bare hands.


I let it ring three more times before I answered.


""Hey.""


""Liv."" His voice was smooth as always. Tired, though. Distracted. ""Listen, I've got this international call tonight. Gonna be late. Don't wait up, okay?""


Another call. Another late night.


There was a time when he'd call me before bed no matter what. When he'd talk to me until I fell asleep.


Now? I got a courtesy heads-up like I was his assistant.


I gripped that cold diamond ring until my nails dug into my palm.


""Gray... do you remember what next Wednesday is?""


Silence.


Then I heard it—a woman's voice in the background, sweet and syrupy:


""Gray, who are you talking to? Come help me, Theo can't get his Legos to work...""


He covered the phone, but I could still hear him: ""I'm handling something. Take Theo and get him ready for bed.""


When he came back on, his voice had an edge.


""It's just an anniversary, Liv. Does it really matter that much? Work's insane right now. I'll have my assistant book us somewhere nice and send you something. Sound good?""


My voice came out shaking.


""Grayson. Are you lying to me?""


He sighed. Hard.


""Jesus Christ, Olivia. I'm out here busting my ass for this family, and you're gonna start with the paranoid bullshit again? I'm exhausted. I'm hanging up.""


Click.


The line went dead.


I set my phone down slowly.


Looked at that diamond ring sitting there like a joke.


And I laughed.


Right. How could I be so ungrateful?


He gave me everything money could buy. Designer clothes, luxury cars, a house most people would kill for.


What more could I possibly want?


Except he had no idea what I actually wanted.


Nine years ago, we were splitting instant ramen in a basement apartment. He told me, ""One day I'm gonna get you out of here. Big house. Huge diamond. The whole thing.""


I'd laughed and said, ""I don't need a big house or a diamond. I just need you to keep loving me like you do right now.""


He'd pulled me close and whispered ""I love you"" over and over until I believed it was permanent.


Turns out nothing's permanent.


And that girl I'd helped out of the goodness of my stupid heart?


She'd found her own way to say thanks.


I barely slept that night.


When I did, I dreamed of knives and blood and babies I'd never hold.


Two days crawled by.


On the third morning, I woke up early.


Sat at the breakfast table with my phone.


She'd posted again.


A selfie this time—full makeup, glowing skin, and on her hand?


That ring. The one from the blue velvet box.


The caption read: ""Thank you babe for the early bday gift ♥ Love you so much! Next Wednesday can't come fast enough!""


Next Wednesday.


Her birthday.


More important than our nine-year anniversary, apparently.


That ring was never meant for me.


I stared out the window at the bright morning sun.


I'd never felt colder in my life.


I grabbed my coat.


""Charles. We're going to Beverly Hills.""


Chapter 3


A young nanny opened the door.


She stared at me for a second, then her face went guarded.


""Can I help you?""


I stepped past her into the entryway.


Two pairs of slippers sat neatly by the door. Men's. Women's.


In the living room, a toddler—maybe two years old—was playing on a foam mat, babbling ""Dada, dada"" over and over.


Every word felt like a needle straight through my chest.


I couldn't breathe.


""I'm here to see Grayson Blackwood.""


Footsteps on the stairs.


She came down wearing a silk robe, all soft and sleepy-looking. When she saw me, panic flashed across her face for half a second before she rearranged it into something pitiful.


""Oh my god... Mrs. Blackwood?""


I looked around slowly.


Family photos on the walls. The three of them, smiling. Baby bottles and toys scattered on the coffee table.


This place looked like an actual home.


More than mine ever did.


""Natalie,"" I said, my voice ice-cold. ""I paid for four years of your college. Was this how you planned to pay me back?""


Her face went sheet-white. Her lip trembled.


""Mrs. Blackwood, I... I don't know what you're talking about...""


""No?""


I pulled out my phone and shoved the photo in her face—the one she'd posted. Her and Grayson and that kid.


""Then explain this. My husband. My grandmother's house. Where's your conscience, Natalie?""


Tears spilled down her cheeks. She dropped to her knees like someone cut her strings.


""I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry! It's all my fault! I just—I love him so much, I couldn't help myself! Please, Mrs. Blackwood, please forgive us!""


She was sobbing now, looking like some tragic heroine.


Once upon a time, maybe I would've felt bad for her.


Now? I just felt sick.


""Love?"" I laughed. It sounded ugly. ""Your love is built on someone else's pain. On betrayal. You call that love?""


I looked down at her, perfectly calm.


""Natalie. Playing house in someone else's home? That's got to have limits. This house is mine.""


Her face crumpled. Fresh tears. The full performance.


""Mrs. Blackwood, you don't understand—Gray and I are really in love. He told me... he said you two don't even have feelings for each other anymore. That he only stays because of obligation.""


""Really in love,"" I repeated slowly. ""So your 'real love' is built on wrecking someone's marriage? In my dead grandmother's house?""


""I... I didn't know it was yours."" She bit her lip, tears streaming. ""Gray said he bought it for me... Mrs. Blackwood, please, don't be mad at him. It's all my fault. If you're angry, yell at me—just don't fight with him. He works so hard already...""


What a saint.


I stared at her pathetic little act and realized something:


I didn't want to fight with her.


She wasn't worth it.


The problem was never her.


It was him.


I pulled out my phone and called Grayson right in front of her.


He picked up on the second ring.


""Liv? What's wrong?""


""Grayson."" My voice was steady. Cold. ""You've got thirty minutes to get your mistress and your kid out of my house.""


I hung up.


Natalie's face went from white to gray.


Less than two minutes later, tires screeched in the driveway.


Grayson came through that door.

I bought one for me and one for my mom.  That's 2 of them.  Both had an issue with the lid not closing all the way, so the coffee wouldn't drain properly to give you the proper amount. Because it was retaining water, it would keep dripping for a while, which makes a mess if you have a larger coffee cup.

  
Another issue with both of them is that the Classic brew setting would brew 2oz more than it was supposed to on all amount settings.  The Over Ice option would brew 2 oz under the proper amount on all settings.  The only thing that worked properly was the Rich setting.

  
I contacted them, and they shipped me a replacement.  With this one, the lid closed properly, so it took care of the draining issue.  It also did the wrong amounts on the settings that i stated before with my previous one.

They sent another replacement, and it's not working properly AGAIN.  I have contacted them again to get yet another replacement, and my mom is having to get a replacement for hers that isn't working properly either.

  
Thats 3 of these coffee makers total that i have personally used that do not work properly. This is the worst product I have ever bought.  For something that is around $100, it should work properly, but they don't.

This has to be a fundamental issue with their manufacturing process, so if you buy one, it more than likely won't work properly either. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!

1q7snmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1q7snmb/10_months_later_green_card_approved/,"10 Months Later, Green Card Approved!","I can’t even begin to count how many times I came to Reddit with severe anxiety, sleepless nights, and a brain stuck on overdrive, desperately searching for answers about our case. So let me start with this—hear me out: EVERY. CASE. IS. ITS. OWN. CASE. Please don’t compare your timeline, your interview, or your process to anyone else’s. Reddit can be a blessing and a curse. Some days you’ll read a post and feel calm. Other days you’ll close the app thinking, “Cool... I learned absolutely nothing” If I can give one piece of advice: trust the process and breathe. Spiraling doesn’t make USCIS move faster (believe me, I tried mentally). Now, our journey officially began on March 15, 2025—and yes, our story is a little different. I’m the petitioner, a female, a U.S. citizen, and this is my third marriage. I’ve been married to a man, to a woman, and now—to a woman again. Hey... it is what it is. Life happens. This time, we did everything ourselves. No lawyers. No prior experience. Just Google, USCIS instructions, Reddit, redbull, and courage. Filing from Long Branch, NJ, I submitted:

* I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative)
* I-485 (Adjustment of Status) Because money was tight and we were both in between jobs, we couldn’t initially file the I-765 (work permit). That part hurt. On April 18, 2025, we received the ASC appointment notice for biometrics in Elizabeth, NJ—small win, big relief. On April 14, 2025, we received a Request for Evidence for the I-485... and yes, my heart dropped a little. Especially because I had uploaded everything one could possibly imagine: USPS address change confirmations, marriage certificates, past marriages and divorces, affidavits from friends and family, joint tax returns, life insurance, car titles and insurance, past and current leases, renter’s insurance, bank and credit card statements, joint phone bills, utility bills, six months of Amazon orders, Spotify and Amazon confirmations, gym contracts, pharmacy records, our dogs’ medical records, Broadway playbills, movie tickets, and mountains of junk mail. And yes—junk mail counts. Grocery store flyers. Holiday cards addressed to both of us. The works. I uploaded 100 photos and our yearly Christmas cards (we have three so far, and I’m honestly very proud of them). On May 20, 2025, thanks to help from friends and family (forever grateful), we were finally able to file the I-765. And wow—employment authorization came back in 18 days. A dream. After 12 years of overstaying, knowing my wife could finally work legally and receive a Social Security card felt unreal. Then July came... and USCIS asked for more evidence. Again. Tedious doesn’t even begin to cover it—but we did it. On October 17, 2025, we received what everyone fears: a denial of the I-485. Why? Income. I knew this could happen. To file, you must meet a certain financial threshold so the government trusts you won’t rely on public assistance. I had hoped— naively—that they’d overlook the numbers. They didn’t. We had weeks to find a sponsor, file Form I-290 (motion to reopen), and pay an additional $800—on top of everything we’d already paid. Then, on October 20, 2025, USCIS asked for more evidence—this time for the I-130. I wanted to quit. I cried. I didn’t sleep. I was angry at life. But then—on November 21, 2025—they reopened the case. Life hadn’t been easy for us financially. I lost my job. My sense of security. My wife couldn’t even earn minimum wage. But somehow... we kept going. And then Christmas came early. On December 1, 2025, we received the letter—our interview was scheduled for Monday, January 5, 2026. I was calm. Excited. Peaceful... until three days before. The panic attacks came back. No sleep. The fear that my wife could be detained at the interview nearly broke me. On January 5, 2026, we arrived in Mount Laurel, NJ, with our wonderful Portuguese translator, holding hands, carrying years of paperwork, hope, fear, and faith. The USCIS agent called my name within 20 minutes of our arrival. I went in alone, while my wife waited with our translator. For 45 minutes straight, he questioned me. Before I even sat down, he asked if I had accepted money for the marriage because of my financial situation. I said no—and honestly, I was angry. It didn’t even make sense. I’m still broke. He asked:
* What I do for work
* What my wife does for work
* What we did on Christmas and New Year’s
* If we’ve traveled together
* How we met, where we met
* If I saw her again after our first date
* Dates of my last two marriages and divorces
* My full address
* Who wakes up first
* What side of the bed I sleep on .....As we were walking out, he asked why my wife didn’t speak English. I explained that she understands and reads well, that we go to the movies all the time together, but that she has a block when it comes to speaking—she’s a perfectionist. He nodded and said, “Okay. She’ll need to match everything you just said.” Look—he was well-trained, respectful, and even smiled attimes. But I would never want to do that interview again. It’s awful having someone doubt your marriage. I walked out, looked at our translator... and realized I forgot to kiss my wife for good luck. She said, “Bye, baby,” and blew me a kiss. I threw one back, but I couldn’t even see her face. I was frozen from all the questions. I’m sure there were more—I just can’t remember them now. Sitting in the waiting room, after about 10 minutes, I checked my watch. Then I heard security being called, and the woman behind the counter said: “Let her know he’s coming in—and that everything will be okay.” I nearly broke my fingers from squeezing my hands so tightly. Remember—my biggest fear was that she would be detained. Ten minutes later, she walked out. I ran to her, kissed her, and kept saying: “You’re here. You’re here with me.” We went home, and I couldn’t stop repeating those words. The next day, we were on our way to a job about 45 minutes from home when I got an email: Her I-130 was approved. Minutes later—her I-485 was approved too. Of course, she was at the local Wawa getting coffee. When she came back to work, we hugged for a long time. She cried and said her entire life in America was running through her mind like a movie—the struggles, the happiness, all of it. And that now, after 13 years, she would finally be able to see her grandmother in Brazil. She couldn’t believe it. Honestly, I think she still can’t. I knew from the day I met her that I would spend my life showing her how much she meant to me and how deeply I loved her. Now, with the start of this new chapter— being able to travel freely, not living in fear of an ICE raid, not worrying if she’ll make it home—we can finally begin to truly live our lives together. To anyone waiting. To anyone scared. To anyone refreshing case status at 2 a.m.—your journey is valid. It’s messy, exhausting, and deeply personal. But one day, this chapter will turn into a story you tell to give someone else hope. Trust the process. Breathe. Your moment will come, your story isn’t over yet.",7,1767917131.0,USCIS,8,0.89,False

1q7sfz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingconfidential/comments/1q7sfz1/what_to_pack_first_when_moving_and_how_to_avoid/,What to pack first when moving (and how to avoid packing panic),"I thought I had my last move under control. I had boxes, bubble wrap, playlists, snacks, and all the “I’ve done this before” stuff. Then two hours in, I realized I’d packed my coffee maker, my shower curtain, and every pair of clean socks I owned.

So there I was, surrounded by tape, half-labeled boxes, and an empty mug, wondering: what on earth do you pack first when moving?

After too many moves (and too many mornings without caffeine), here’s my system, which is equal parts checklist and survival strategy, to keep the chaos at bay.

**Start with the stuff you don’t need daily**

The easiest way to feel productive early is to start with things you won’t miss. Think:

* Seasonal clothes
* Extra bedding
* Books, wall art, and decorative stuff

Packing these first gives you momentum without messing up your daily routine. I start with my winter coats and holiday decorations, mostly because I know I won’t need them mid-July.

Bonus tip: label everything. I’m sure you don’t want to rip open 10 boxes just to find a spatula (right?).

**Next up: extras and backups**

If you have duplicates, pack the spares. Towels, blankets, dishes, random Tupperware are all fair game. You’ll be shocked how many “just in case” items you never actually use.

During my last move, I realized I owned three cutting boards. I packed the big one, donated the second, and used the smaller one for every meal for two weeks. No regrets; just cleaner counters.

Early wins like these make the packing process feel less overwhelming and a little more strategic.

**Handle sentimental and decorative items early**

If you wait until the end to pack sentimental stuff, you’ll end up emotionally spiraling while everyone else is hauling boxes.

Take an hour early on to pack the keepsakes, photos, and mementos. Wrap them carefully, label them clearly, and get them out of sight.

It sounds small, but getting those “heart” items handled first frees you up to tackle the rest without distractions (or ugly-cry breaks).

**Save daily essentials for last**

This is where my coffee disaster could’ve been avoided. Don’t touch your daily items until the very end. That includes:

* Toothbrush, soap, shower curtain
* Favorite mug, coffee setup, a few pots and plates and utensils
* Medications, pet food, chargers
* Two or three outfits and a towel
* Bedding
* Important documents

Pack those in an “essentials” box or suitcase that travels with you. I call it my last-48-hours survival kit.

Trust me, nothing humbles you like slurping cereal out of a measuring cup because you boxed every bowl and spoon.

**Make a moving week survival bin**

When you’re down to the final stretch, it helps to have a bin or bag with the things you’ll need right before and after the move.

Here’s mine:

* Cleaning wipes and paper towels
* Toilet paper (learned that one the hard way)
* Snacks and bottled water
* Basic tools, phone chargers, and pain relievers (because moving is back-breaking)

It’s the stuff you’ll reach for when you’re too tired to dig through boxes but still need to function like a human being.

**Deal with the big stuff strategically**

Once the small things are under control, you can focus on the bulky items like furniture, appliances, and the mystery “garage boxes” that haven’t been opened since your last move.

I used to think I could handle it all solo until my couch got stuck halfway through a door frame. Today, I’m more inclined to check a comparison site like MoveBuddha to find movers who actually do this for a living. Bonus: they’ve got a packing cost calculator too, so you can figure out if hiring help beats your chiropractor bill later.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, this is where pros save you time and sanity.

**Learn from my chaos**

If I could redo my last move, I’d start earlier, label better, and keep my caffeine source accessible at all costs.

Here’s the simple order I swear by now:

* Pack what you don’t use daily.
* Follow with duplicates and decor.
* Save the essentials for last.
* Keep one “survival” bin handy.
* Hire help for the heavy stuff.

That’s it. No fancy systems. Just common sense that took me three moves and one coffee-deprivation meltdown to figure out.

What about you? What do you pack first when moving? Do you follow a system, or do you just start taping boxes and hope for the best? 

Share your chaos, wins, and hacks. Someone (probably me) could use the advice before the next move.",1,1767916615.0,movingconfidential,0,1.0,False

I don’t do drugs. I was sober, not on any medication, I’ve never had hallucinations, and it wasn’t carbon monoxide poisoning.

I’ve had a few strange or paranormal things happen in my life, like objects disappearing and then showing up days later in random places, but nothing like this had ever happened before.

When I was around 17, I was getting ready to go out to meet a friend for coffee. I grabbed my makeup bag to do my makeup and tried to find my beauty blender. I had a set of three blue beauty blenders. Two of them had already gone missing, which was weird because I kept them all in the same makeup bag and never took it anywhere. I was sure I still had one left.

When I opened the bag, it wasn’t there.
I searched over and over, but it was just gone. I was really annoyed. I had a younger cousin who lived next door and came over almost every day, and I started thinking she might have taken it.

I went into my sister’s room with my makeup bag. My mom was there too, and I started venting about my cousin, saying she keeps stealing my stuff and being annoying. They told me to calm down and helped me look for it, but it wasn’t anywhere. Eventually, I gave up, sat on the floor, and started doing my makeup anyway.

I was using a small compact mirror. When I looked down to grab a brush, there was a blue beauty blender sitting right in front of me. I knew for a fact it hadn’t been there before.
I just stared at it, completely confused. Then, right in front of my eyes, another one appeared. Before I could even react, a third one appeared.

Literally right in front of my eyes.
I still don’t understand how to explain it. It wasn’t like I suddenly noticed them. I actually saw them appear, like they materialized out of thin air really fast.

My mom and sister saw it too. They didn’t see the exact moment the way I did, but they saw them appear there out of nowhere. All three of us were shocked. None of us could believe what we were seeing. It felt completely unreal.

I know this sounds hard to believe, and honestly, I’d not believe it too if I hadn’t experienced it myself. But it still haunts me. I have no idea what it was. A glitch in the matrix or something paranormal. I genuinely don’t know.",13,1767916541.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,4,1.0,False

1q7ses5,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteContent/comments/1q7ses5/why_local_seo_is_crucial_for_small_businesses_in/,Why Local SEO Is Crucial for Small Businesses in Palm Beach Gardens,"In the heart of South Florida, Palm Beach Gardens stands as a vibrant and growing community filled with opportunity. From charming cafés to skilled tradespeople and boutique shops, small businesses are at the core of the city’s local economy. But in a place where competition is only a few blocks away, how do small businesses stand out? The answer is simple: local SEO.

Local SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is no longer optional—it’s essential. When someone in Palm Beach Gardens searches for a “coffee shop near me” or a “plumber in Palm Beach Gardens,” local SEO determines whether your business shows up in those results. If your business doesn’t appear on the first page, you’re missing out on a massive number of potential customers who are actively looking for what you offer.

One of the most powerful aspects of local SEO is how targeted it is. Unlike broader marketing strategies, local SEO focuses specifically on attracting people who are in your area and ready to engage. That means your efforts aren’t just reaching random internet users—they’re connecting you with real people in your community who are likely to walk through your door or pick up the phone. It’s a level of precision that no traditional advertising can match.

Another major benefit? Trust. When a customer sees your business listed on Google with reviews, business hours, and a local address, it builds immediate credibility. You become more than just a name—they know you're a part of their neighborhood. That familiarity turns into loyalty. And loyalty, especially in a close-knit place like Palm Beach Gardens, can make all the difference.

Investing in **local SEO services Palm Beach Gardens** means staying ahead of competitors, especially those still relying solely on outdated methods like print ads or word-of-mouth alone. Whether you’re new to the area or have been around for decades, optimizing your online presence for local search ensures your business keeps growing with the community around it.

Small businesses are the heartbeat of Palm Beach Gardens, and local SEO is the megaphone that helps them be heard. It’s affordable, effective, and built for long-term success. So if you’re serious about connecting with local customers and growing your footprint in this beautiful city, there’s no better time to start than now.",1,1767916531.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

She either can’t give me a straight yes or no or she will just deflect the question back to me. 

If I ask do you want to do ____? She will just say idk is that what you want to do? 

Or if I say “I’m going to get a coffee do you want to come with me?”

She’ll say “do you want me to go?” 

And every single time I express to her that I wouldn’t have invited her and asked if I didn’t want you to. You can never just tell me yes or no. It’s always asking me the question back. 

Her response to that is something along the lines of “then you should just say “will you come with me instead of do you want to come with me?” I honestly don’t hear the difference. She claims she wants to know I want her to go with me and I again just say well I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t want you to?

I asked her why she does this and she doesn’t know. It got to the point that one day I said to her “Okay so I’ll just make the decision for both of us then and won’t ask you anymore” and she got mad at that lol 

I just wish she had her own opinion on decisions. She’s been like this for as long as I’ve known her. 

Don’t get me wrong I have my days where even I’m like this but with her it’s almost everything. I guess I’m just tired of “I’m cool with whatever you want to do” or “is that what you want to do?” 

It’s like why can’t you just have your own damn opinion? If you tell me no at least that’s something I can WORK with. 😂

I brought all of this up to her a decent amount of times and she just gets really defensive about it all. 

I use to have a friend like this as well in our group. I’m all for going with the flow and being cool with whatever but sometimes in a group it’s nice to get multiple opinions and suggestions. The ironic thing is although he said he was cool with anything by the time we came to a decision and we’re doing it…9/10 times he wasn’t happy with it. We gave you the floor dude lol I swear it’s like the ones who claim to be the most laid back and easy going are the most obnoxious people to have in your circle. 
 

TLDR: Girlfriend avoids giving clear yes/no answers, deflects decisions back to me, and defaults to “whatever you want.” It’s been constant for 6 years, I’ve explained it multiple times, and it’s sometimes annoying me because it feels like she has no opinions and puts all decision-making on me.",2,1767916458.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

I know that many new members have problems with the Word of Wisdom, to the point that even pages close to the church suggest softening it.

But if some people have problems, it's precisely because they're addictive substances. That's precisely why I've never been attracted to drinking coffee, tea, and alcohol.

I take great care of my health, and when science confirms faith, we should no longer have any doubts about why certain commandments were given. Drinking coffee causes dark circles under the eyes and ruins your sleeping, drinking alcohol damages the skin (and destroys the liver). Hot drinks, in general, significantly increase the risk of throat and intestinal cancer. For example, I like hot chocolate, but I let it cool before drinking for this reason.

And the same argument can be extended to the Old Testament commandments regarding pork and seafood, which are full of parasites. And that's why I don't eat them either.

The Word of Wisdom actually includes other rules that few people know about, but they are linked to a different historical context, where pioneers moved from state to state, there was a shortage of meat, cereals were easy to store, etc.

But these commandments were inspired by the Prophet 200 years ago, in a context where food was rationed due to scarcity, but it was genuine. Today, this is no longer so obvious. There are so many new chemical additives and ultra-processed foods that lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer, etc.

I know that, precisely because they are addictive, this might be difficult for many. And I know that many, even church members, innocently consume many foods that are harmful to their health. 

But I pray that the Church not only maintains the Word of Wisdom, but also updates it by at least providing guidelines on a health code that considers many of the foods that unfortunately fill supermarket shelves today as foods to be avoided.",0,1767916387.0,latterdaysaints,7,0.36,False

Our trip started with our Taxi Driver trying to scam us for more money upon drop off, but won’t go too deep into that. Use Uber if you are in Egypt, the one time we didn’t we had issues. 

First off upon arrival we noticed the park looks to be in shambles, lots of abandoned buildings, things don’t look maintained, and minimal employees. 

We walked up to the 1 open ticket booth, got 2 tickets and headed to \[Dark Ride\] an indoor Vekoma. When we boarded the ride the worker started asking us for money as a tip in broken English, we played dumb. He hounded us for about 2 mins before starting the ride, and when we came back he started asking again. It felt uncomfortable to leave our belongings in the station with someone begging for money. To note there are signs around the park that say No Tipping and that they are there to serve us, so the park knows this is going on to some degree. 

The ride experience was actually pretty good though, the ride has decent speed, and some sharp turns that provide some great moments. We would have went another round if we didn’t feel so uncomfortable around the worker. 

Next we headed to \[Roller Coaster\] which we were dreading as the only thing worse than a SLC is a poorly maintained SLC. The first thing we noticed was the lift hill moving at a slow pace, I’ll link a video in comments of just how slow. We entered the line and got turned around as apparently this a premium attraction and you have to pay to ride! We left the line and found a hidden ticket booth to the right of the entrance. It costed 50 EGP (1.06 USD) per ticket, we got them and got back in line. 

The ride was actually not horrible for a SLC? Idk maybe it’s the slow lift hill making the ride slower but it wasn’t as jerky and it didn’t hurt at all. When you got to the end brake run you are greeted with a disassembled train on the catwalk. 

Lastly with the park closing we headed over to the final credit \[Family Coaster\] a Vekoma family coaster with a mine train themed train and a Japanese themed entrance.. didn’t make sense but again the ride rode good and felt faster than a normal family coaster. 

Overall a decent visit with some hiccups, and a great way to get some credits when you’re done with the pyramids.",16,1767916238.0,rollercoasters,4,1.0,False

I think it’s a self esteem on my own part thing, because honestly shes skinnier, prettier, and they have way more things in common than he and I do. But I hurt my own feelings and I said something mean and he’s been really angry with me for weeks. 

And I did something I never wanted to do, I read his messages. And theres no real suggestion of cheating, but him absolutely shit talking me to her. And some of it’s just “oh I know she’s gonna start a big fight about that” over literally something that I didn’t even think twice about lead alone wanted to fight about it, and “she can dish out her bullshit but I say one thing and I’m the devil” which I mean he’s entitled to his feelings….. but I didn’t know he felt like that. He’s never once expressed to me that I’m so difficult to be with. But then,  some of it isn’t even true - he said he was mad that we had to cancel plans to go out for coffee with other friends because “I was in a mood” when he was the one that canceled and I was disappointed we weren’t going out. He told her his seasonal depression is back, he hasn’t mentioned that to me at all. 

I think it hurts even more to know he was just telling her how miserable he is when he won’t tell me. I can be kind of intense at times, but I really didn’t think I was this awful. Not so awful he can’t even talk to me about small things. 

My biggest fear that I’ve expressed to him hundreds of times is I don’t want us to avoid things and start to resent each other until one day he just leaves without me even knowing there was an issue, but that’s literally what’s happening.

I find that most of the things I *want* to do involve being inside. I love cooking, doing my housework, reading a book, making artwork, playing instruments, etc.

On occasion, I’ll get what I feel like is a mild type of agoraphobia. I live in a big and busy city and I’m sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of things people and traffic outside and it’s just turn me off from going anywhere.

Whether by chance, or my Grandpas guidance, they pulled over to spend the night in Cooperstown, NY. My Grandpa (RIP) always figured himself a bit of a big shot, so he attempted to get a room at the nicest hotel in town, the Otesaga Hotel.



He was told at the desk that, due to the 1974 Hall of Fame inductions and game that had occurred that day, they were fully booked, save one suite that was a last minute cancel. So he took it for him and his sons.



That evening, they went down to the dining room for dinner, and found themselves surrounded by Hall of Fame players doing the same, after attending the induction and game that day. My youngest uncle was 12 years old, and grabbed the only thing he had, his menu (which is helpfully dated), and went around gathering autographs.

One last bit of trivia from the story. Notably absent is Mickey Mantle, who was inducted famously that day beside Whitey. Supposedly after the induction, he had to leave town for a family emergency, and that is whose suite my Grandfather was able to book and use. I’m told this info was provided by the front desk.

I already keep everything to a relative minimum so I’m at least somewhat controlled in how much can pile up. But then I’ll start using soup spoons and forks to stir my coffee once I’ve run out of clean teaspoons etc aaaand here we are.

First things first: I checked with the mods before posting this. 💜

I’ll keep this brief here and spare you a wall of text (there’s a link with full details if you want them.)

The short version: I’ve been living under the poverty line since around March 2020… trying to remember what happened then. Something big. Anyway. Like a lot of people, I’ve been making it work.

In November 2025, I found out my foster mom (my mom, for simplicity’s sake) is very unwell. I took a holiday village job specifically to afford a flight to spend time with her, possibly for the last time. That part worked! My boss was generous, the pay was solid, and I’m grateful for it.

Unfortunately, two things collided shortly after:

* I lost my public health insurance, which means I’m currently paying out of pocket for insulin and other meds (for at least a couple months...maybe reimbursable later, but right now… oof).
* And my best friend Elvira, my beloved cat and constant companion, has become seriously ill and needs immediate, expensive care.

All the details are in the link. I’ll also say what I say there: I know *many* people are struggling right now, and choosing to help anyone is an active, intentional choice. If you do choose to help me? Thank you, truly, from my gay, cholesterol-filled heart. 🫀✨

If anyone wants to talk, my DMs are open. I’m always up for coffee! Though apparently it’s $7 now (iced, soy). How. Why. When did this happen.

TLDR: Remission vs flare, how varied are your BM types and when to be worried. I’m getting a calpro test on Tuesday anyway and seeing by GI in Feb. 

Long version and back story:

After 2 years remission, mesalamine meds only, I got hit by a big flare in September. No doubt caused by a confluence of personal and professional stressors that ended up resolving. Stress is always my biggest trigger. 

Had to go on cortiment and by October I had a scope that showed quiescent colitis. 2 weeks before my scope my BMs were a consistent type 4.

I had an FMT which included 10 days heavy duty antibiotics, first dose administered during my scope and then 9 days of enemas of the FMT, held over night. The course of antibiotics loosed everything right up again.

Since the FMT my BMs have been wildly varied from staring at a type 6 (infrequent) through to the occasional 3.  But different day to day stressors and diet affect me acutely. I’ve also had a lot of travel (got married and had my honeymoon overseas and then domestic travel visiting families).

I’m getting a calpro test this Tuesday to determine inflammation, but the varied BMs has me worried I’m on the edge of a flare. 
I don’t have any blood, mucus or urgency. I’m only going in the morning, 1-2 times depending on if I have a coffee. 

I’ve read through other posts here to see how people are varied, but would be grateful for responses to gain an informal baseline of what is normal for other people living with ulcerative colitis. But I know there is no normal.

There are choices, fast questions, and unfamiliar words. The good news? With a little practice, this everyday moment can become a confidence boost instead of a worry.

In most coffee shops, the conversation follows a predictable pattern. You’ll usually hear a greeting, a question about your order, and a follow-up like “Anything else?” Knowing this rhythm helps you feel prepared.

Here’s a simple example:

**Barista:** Hi! What can I get for you?  
**You:** I’d like a medium latte, please.  
**Barista:** Hot or iced?  
**You:** Hot, please.  
**Barista:** Anything else?  
**You:** No, that’s all. Thank you.

TW: blood

I'm Cam, and this happened when I was 20. I've known tamy since elementary school and Erica since high school. We were always very close friends, hanging out at each other's houses all the time. Our parents knew each other and got along well, and we went on vacation together. We were like sisters.

When I was 19, I moved out of my parents' house to live with my partner. From then on, my apartment was our favorite hangout. We had sleepovers that lasted for days, we'd get together for coffee and gossip, and my partner even slept over at his mom's or left the house to give us some privacy.

I'm mentioning all this so you understand what our relationship was like.

Now for the problem: the year after I moved out, I got pregnant. I wasn't looking for it, but it didn't bother me either. My partner had a stable job, health insurance, and I was in my third year of university. At first, I didn't tell anyone, since I wanted to wait until I was further along.

At 10 weeks, I lost it and fell into a terrible depression. I kept going to my classes, but I wasn't paying attention, I didn't answer messages, I slept a lot. I would read the group chats, them talking about crushes, about something a classmate said that was stupid. I would just read and feel so disconnected from them, so far removed from that world. I felt that if I told them how I felt, they wouldn't listen.

I still hadn't told anyone what happened to me, not even my parents.

During the following weeks, my body continued to feel terrible. I spent a whole month going to different doctors, getting a lot of tests done, and I kept posting the typical waiting room photo to my close friends story with captions like ""here again"" or ""I'm tired."" Just for laughs, to escape reality.

Until one day, in the middle of class, i started bleeding really hard, way too hard. I left and went to the hospital, where I was admitted.

Once I was stable, I decided to post another picture of myself in the hospital bed on Instagram. That night, when I was discharged, Tamy messaged me asking how I was. I told her I was fine, that I was home, and that I'd tell them more when I saw them.

One day, Erica sent a message to the group chat, ""Hey, when web hangout again?"" And tamy said after the 15th, since she had an important exam. That annoyed me, because my birthday is on the 9th and they know it. It annoyed me even more that they knew something was wrong with me and couldn't find two hours to come and say hello.

Days went by, and my 21st birthday came around. And nothing from them. They just sent me a happy birthday and that was it; they didn't even post a picture. (Something really silly, but it really bothered me at the time)

After two months of not seeing them and them not asking about me, I decided to send a group message saying I felt abandoned, that I'd had a horrible few months, and that I felt like they didn't care about me. Erica replied that she didn't mean any harm, that she was worried when I disappeared out of nowhere, but she didn't know how to reach out. Tamy responded (verbatim), ""We're all adults, and I was really busy with my exams. I can't guess what's wrong. I tried asking you what happened, and you just said you were fine. What was I supposed to do?"" At that moment, it felt awful. I felt like all my pain didn't matter and that I was wrong to complain. I told them I'd lost a baby. I didn't want to tell them because it was too much to share in a text message, and I just needed some support from my friends, who hadn't cared about me for two months. They left me on read.

Then, I ran into Erica on the street, and we talked. I felt like she understood my point, that I wasn't blaming them for anything, but that I was feeling very alone, and that message was my cry for help. All I wanted was for us to see each other again like before.

The next day, they posted a picture of themselves on a picnic. It hurt, but I let it go. I thought, maybe it was already planned, and that's why they didn't invite me. Five days later, another picture, them out for a walk. A week later, another picture, them having coffee. In two months, they couldn't find a day to hangout the three of us, and suddenly now they see each other twice a week?

I left the group chat, unfollowed them on Instagram, and when Erica asked if everything was okay, I left her on read.

Since then, they haven't sent me a single message.

Am I the bad guy? Did I overreact? I still miss them, but I feel like if the story had been reversed, if I had been one of them, I would have done everything possible to protect them.

So about two months back I bought the Acer Swift 14 AI with a ryzen AI 365 / 32 gigs of ram / 1TB drive for about 650ish. Was a pretty good deal, installed arch and besides the wrestling match to get the speakers to play audio I was having a great experience.

It wasn't until I started putting it into my bag and putting the device to sleep that I would notice. I would leave my morning uni class and go get coffee with a friend and then when I pull my laptop out to take some notes down before the next class, it wouldn't wake up. Kind of thing where you mash the caps key or press the space bar a few times, but after 1-2 minutes I gave up and had to hard power off, and turn on the machine again to get it to get back into linux. This issue was so bad that I considered going back to windows all together because after two months I was tired of it, but then read an interesting forum post from another user seeing that the iommu would have issues waking up.

I use systemd boot, so I went to the conf file in /boot/loader/entries/ to edit my arch.conf.

under the options line, I added `amd_iommu=off` at the end, saved it, rebooted. I have never had an issue since I added it.

For grub you would have to edit the grub config file in /etc/default/grub

at the line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=` add `amd_iommu=off`, save it and then update the grub.

My boss who's life is imploding because of her alcoholic soon-to-be-exhusband, has a big heart, but cant handle life on life's terms? Also laid off.

My 60+ year old coworker who was doing a great job. Laid off too.

More happened in other departments. And why? Growth. This is besides the point here.

I have more than a million reasons to justify a drink. But the fact is I wont. 

I had coffee earlier with a friend in the program.

1q7rnw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q7rnw4/case_closed_unknown/,Case Closed: Unknown…,"He lived the kind of life people stop noticing. Same bus every morning, same coffee order, same nod to the cashier who never remembered his name. Neighbors described him as “quiet” or “nice enough,” the kind of person you’d trust to water your plants and never think about again. That was the point. He learned early that being unremarkable was a skill, and he practiced it every day.
When people started disappearing, the city panicked in the loud, unfocused way cities do. News anchors spoke in grim tones, detectives chased timelines that went nowhere, and everyone had a theory that sounded convincing until it didn’t. He watched it all unfold from a distance that felt almost unreal, listening to podcasts about the case while cooking dinner, shaking his head along with everyone else. There were no patterns they could prove, no witnesses who agreed, no evidence that stayed solid for long.
Years passed. The fear faded into history, then into trivia. The case went cold, then colder. He grew older, softer around the edges, still invisible. Sometimes he wondered if the worst part wasn’t that he was never caught, but that no one ever truly saw him at all.",2,1767914684.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1q7rmns,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegaladviceGerman/comments/1q7rmns/englische_übersetzung_gvp_manteltarifvertrag/,Englische Übersetzung GVP Manteltarifvertrag (Zusammenschluss BAP + iGZ),"Da mich ein Freund um Hilfe bat, habe ich mich tiefer mit der Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsindustrie beschäftigt. Wenig überraschend nutzt diese Industrie vor allem bei Beschäftigten aus Ländern mit anderem Rechtssystem Unwissenheit zum Teil schamlos aus. Nicht mal der Urlaubsanspruch wird kommuniziert. Während die iGZ vor einigen Jahren den Tarifvertrag noch übersetzt hat, findet man vomBranchenverband in spe keine Übersetzungen der offiziellen Dokumente mehr online. Dabei gibt es einige Neuerungen wie den Wegfall der Probezeit (aber noch kürzere Kündigungsfristen für Neueinsteiger), die absolut wissenswert für Expats sind. 


Ich habe deswegen eine Übersetzung des aktuellen Manteltarifvertrag 2026 erstellt. Teilt gerne eure Erfahrungen mit Zeitarbeitsfirmen und macht unter diesem Post auf böse Tricks im Zusammenhang mit dem Tarifvertrag aufmerksam. Ich habe die Übersetzung bestmöglich geprüft und kuratiert, aber kann dennoch natürlich nicht absolute Korrektheit garantieren. Dies ist mein erster Reddit-Post und hoffe er trägt hier etwas Gutes bei. Fragen sind willkommen.

## § 1 Scope of Application

This collective agreement applies:

**§ 1.1 geographically** to the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany;

**§ 1.2 by industry/sector** to the member companies bound by collective agreements that belong to the *Gesamtverband der Personaldienstleister e. V.* (including their auxiliary and ancillary operations).

This collective agreement does **not** apply to temporary employment agencies and parts of such agencies that form a corporate group (*Konzern*) with the client company within the meaning of section 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act (*Aktiengesetz*), if:

a) the temporary employment agency takes over, to a significant extent, employees who were previously employed by the client company, and  
b) the employees concerned are deployed at their former workplace or at a comparable workplace within the client company, and  
c) this results in existing wage agreements applicable at the client company being circumvented to the detriment of the employees concerned;

**§ 1.3 personally** to all employees who are assigned to client companies within the framework of temporary agency work (*employee leasing*) and who are members of one of the trade unions that are parties to this agreement.

On an individual contractual basis, pay arrangements that deviate from this collective agreement may be agreed with employees who are employed outside the scope of collective agreements (*außertariflich*), provided that their annual earnings exceed the collectively agreed annual earnings of the highest collective pay group.

The masculine terms used in this collective agreement are used solely for ease of reading and apply irrespective of gender.

## § 2 Start and end of the employment

**§ 2.1** The employer must conclude the employment contract with the employee at least in text form (section 126b German Civil Code ""*BGB*"") in accordance with section 2(1) sentence 2 of the Verification Act (*Nachweisgesetz*). In individual cases, a written employment contract will be provided upon the employee’s request.

**§ 2.2** If the employee does not appear on the first working day and does not immediately notify the employer of the reason for being prevented from working on that first day, the employment relationship shall be deemed not to have been established.

**§ 2.3** The employment relationship ends at the end of the calendar month in which the employee first becomes entitled to an unreduced statutory standard old-age pension under the provisions of the statutory pension insurance scheme, or would become entitled if the employee were insured under the statutory pension scheme.

This does not apply to employment relationships concluded before 1 January 2026 on the basis of the BAP framework collective agreement (*Manteltarifvertrag BAP – MTV BAP*). Contractual agreements in the employment contract remain unaffected.

**§ 2.4** During the first three months, the employment relationship may be terminated with one week’s notice. After completion of the third month up to completion of the sixth month, it may be terminated with two weeks’ notice.

> In the end this is the same as probationary period

For new hires, the notice period during the first two weeks of employment may be shortened by employment contract to one day. “New hires” are employment relationships with employees who have not been in an employment relationship with the employer for at least three months.

Otherwise, the notice periods in section 622(1) and (2) German Civil Code apply to termination by either the employer or the employee.

> This means four weeks in advance (termination only at the 15th and the last of the month for the employee). For the employer the notice period increases over time from after two years of employment.

The notice periods apply equally to fixed-term employment relationships.

Termination must be in writing (section 623 German Civil Code).

Statutory provisions on termination without notice remain unaffected.

## § 3 Working Time

**§ 3.1**\* The individual regular monthly working time for full-time employees is 151.67 hours. This corresponds to an average weekly working time of 35 hours.

By way of exception, in justified individual cases a longer individual regular monthly working time may be agreed in the employment contract if the employee is employed predominantly at client companies that have a longer company-specific individual regular weekly working time (*irwAz*). In such cases, the contractual arrangement may not exceed the working time regulated at the client company.

Such a contractual agreement may not exceed an average weekly working time of up to 40 hours (173.34 hours/month). Remuneration will be adjusted accordingly in this case.

This provision does not exclude cases where, exceptionally, the employee is temporarily assigned to a company whose company-agreed *irwAz* is lower than that agreed in the employment contract.

**§ 3.2** Part-time work exists where the employee’s contractually agreed working time is lower than the collectively agreed working time of a full-time employee. Part-time employees have the same collectively agreed rights and obligations within the scope of their employment contract as full-time employees, unless otherwise provided by the collective agreements.

**§ 3.3** The actual schedule of working time shall be aligned with that of the client company. Start and end of daily working time, including breaks, and the distribution of working time across the weekdays are governed by the provisions or requirements applicable in the respective client company.

**§ 3.4** Changing clothes, washing, and rest breaks within the meaning of the Working Time Act (*Arbeitszeitgesetz*) (e.g. breakfast, lunch, coffee breaks) do not count as working time, unless different rules apply for employees in the client company.

**§ 3.5** Where the employee is deployed in fully continuous shift work (“conti shift”) or a comparable shift model of the hirer, the hirer’s working time/supplement model applies only if a full cycle is completed. If no full cycle is completed, the average monthly working time is used for calculating the hours worked for that period.

**§ 3.6** On Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, working time ends at 2:00 p.m. For work performed beyond that time, the surcharge rules for public holidays apply. Both days may be compensated as days off via the working time account or the leave account.

## § 4 Working Time Account

**§ 4.1** A working time account is established to balance the monthly deviations between the employee’s individual regular working time agreed under § 3.1 / § 3.2 and the actual working time under § 3.3. Plus and minus hours may be recorded in the working time account.

**§ 4.2** Plus hours are working hours accrued above the individual regular monthly working time. Minus hours are working hours below the individual regular monthly working time.

The working time account may contain a maximum of 200 plus hours.

To safeguard employment, the working time account may, in individual cases, contain up to 230 plus hours in the event of seasonal fluctuations.

If the balance exceeds 150 hours, the employer is obliged to secure the plus hours exceeding 150 hours—including the social security contributions attributable to them—against insolvency and to provide evidence of this insolvency protection to the employee. Without such proof, the working time account may—deviating from paragraphs 2 and 3—contain a maximum of 150 hours, and the employee is not obliged to perform plus hours beyond 150.

For part-time employment, the above maximum limits of the working time account are adjusted proportionally to the contractually agreed working time. The employer’s obligation to provide insolvency protection only from a balance of 150 hours remains unaffected.

Working hours lost due to public holidays are credited to the working time account in the amount of the lost working time, in accordance with the distribution of working time under § 3.3.

**§ 4.3** The working time account must be balanced no later than after 12 months.

If time off in lieu is not possible within this period, it must be taken in the following three months. For this purpose, the employer must reach an agreement with the affected employee no later than after the 12 months in accordance with paragraph 1, with the aim of achieving full balancing.

If balancing is also not possible within this period for operational reasons, a carry-over into the next balancing period of a maximum of 150 hours (pro-rata for part-time employees) is permitted. Any hours beyond that must be compensated in money.

The transfer of these time credits occurs within the time account limits under § 4.2 and does not extend them.

**§ 4.4** Balancing of time accounts is generally carried out by taking time off according to the following rules:

a) By agreement with the employee, plus hours may be compensated by time off at any time.  
b) During an assignment at the client, the employee may request one day off from the time account for every 35 plus hours. This right may be exercised only once per calendar month, for a maximum of two working days.

A one-week notice period must be observed for this claim.

The employer is entitled to refuse the request for time off for urgent operational reasons.

If the request is refused, the employee is entitled to a binding agreement on the later scheduling of the requested days off.

c) By agreement between employee and employer, additional days off within a month may be scheduled, or days off from several months may be combined.  
d) By agreement between employee and employer, up to 70 hours from the time account may be paid out in money within the balancing period.  
e) Independently of the balancing period, at the employee’s request and with the employer’s consent, an individual arrangement may be agreed for the payout of time credits up to a maximum of 20 hours per month.  
f) At the employee’s request, hours on the working time account that exceed 91 plus hours shall be paid out. For part-time employees, the number of plus hours is determined pro rata according to the contractually agreed working time.  
g) Time off requested by the employee to reduce credit hours on the working time account is not interrupted by allocation of a new assignment.

In the event of incapacity for work during claimed time off in lieu, the time will be re-credited to the working time account.

**§ 4.5** Upon leaving, a positive time credit balance is paid out. Minus hours are offset up to 35 hours in the case of the employee’s own resignation or extraordinary termination, insofar as making up the time is not operationally possible. This does not apply if the employer gave cause for the termination.

**§ 4.6** After notice of termination has been given, the employer is entitled to release the employee from work while continuing to pay remuneration and offsetting any holiday entitlement and credits from the working time account. In the case of termination for operational reasons, release for the purpose of reducing the working time account is possible only with the employee’s consent.

**§ 4.7** Supplements and allowances are paid together with the remuneration for the month in which they arise and are not transferred to the working time account. Payouts of hours from the working time account are always made only at the collectively agreed hourly rates, without taking into account sector supplements and other allowances and supplements.

## § 5 Standby Duty / On-call Duty / On-call Availability / Rest Periods

Where employees are deployed at client companies with standby time, standby duty, or on-call availability, and company and/or collective special provisions on working time and rest periods apply to the client company in accordance with section 7 Working Time Act (*ArbZG*), these provisions apply accordingly, with the proviso that the respective rule applies in full to the employee.

## § 6 Surcharges

**§ 6.1 Overtime**  
Overtime is working time exceeding regular monthly working time.

Surcharges are payable for the full working hours by which the agreed individual regular monthly working time under § 3.1 / § 3.2 is exceeded in a month by more than 15%.

For reaching the threshold from which an entitlement to overtime surcharge exists under § 6.1 paragraph 2, not only the hours actually worked but also taken leave hours are taken into account.

The surcharge amounts to 25% of the relevant collectively agreed hourly wage under §§ 2 to 4 of the pay agreement (*Entgelttarifvertrag*).

**§ 6.2 Night work**  
Night work is work performed between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

The amount of the supplement for night work is based on the supplement rules of the client company. It amounts to a maximum of 25% of the relevant collectively agreed hourly wage under §§ 2 to 4 of the pay agreement.

> This means you have to get same percentage extra as the colleagues who work for the client on a regular basis

**§ 6.3 Sunday and public holiday work**  
Sunday and public holiday work is work performed on Sundays and statutory public holidays between 12:00 a.m. and 12:00 midnight.

The amount of the supplement is based on the supplement rules of the client company. It is a maximum of 50% of the relevant collectively agreed hourly wage under §§ 2 to 4 of the pay agreement for Sunday work and a maximum of 100% for public holiday work and for work on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve after 2:00 p.m.

> So here it is the same as with night work

Whether public holiday work exists depends on the public holiday law applicable at the place of assignment.

**§ 6.4** If several of the above supplements coincide, only the highest is payable.

## § 7 Assignment Rules

**§ 7.1** Insofar as the employee is assigned tasks in the client company, they are subject to the client company’s right to issue instructions. The employer’s general right to issue instructions remains unaffected.

**§ 7.2** The employee is obliged, upon the employer’s instruction, to work at changing places of assignment. Any limiting provisions require an explicit contractual agreement.

The employee is entitled to an assignment notice containing the essential details of their assignment at the client company.

**§ 7.3** If the one-way travel time outside working hours from the place of residence to the place of assignment at the client company exceeds 1 hour and 15 minutes when using the fastest public transport connection by time, the employee will be paid—per outward and return journey—for the travel time exceeding 1 hour and 15 minutes at the collectively agreed rates under §§ 2 to 4 of the pay agreement, provided the employee actually spent this travel time.

A prerequisite is that the employee asserts the claim in text form no later than at the end of the month.

For an ongoing assignment, the employee must report the increased travel times and their regularity once, and thereafter only if changes occur.

**§ 7.4** If the travel time within the meaning of § 7.3 exceeds 2 hours, the employee is entitled to reimbursement of accommodation costs as follows:

The temporary employment agency generally organises the accommodation and bears the full costs. If the employee needs to organise accommodation themselves, the costs will be borne or reimbursed by the employer after prior approval and submission of a corresponding receipt/invoice.

Alternatively, an overnight allowance at the level of the tax rates may be agreed.

**§ 7.5** Any other reimbursement of expenses under section 670 German Civil Code is to be regulated in an individual contract.

## § 8 Time off work

> This is additionally to regular holidays

**§ 8.1** In direct connection with the following events, the employee must be granted paid leave of absence without it being counted against holiday entitlement:

a) for the employee’s own marriage, and for the birth of the spouse or registered civil partner: 1 day  
b) in the event of the death of close relatives:  
– spouse, children, parents, and registered civil partner: 2 days  
– siblings, parents-in-law: 1 day  
c) for the performance of public duties imposed by law (e.g. honorary offices, being summoned as a witness or comparable situations) and for participation as a member of a bargaining commission of a DGB member union in bargaining commission meetings, with any compensation received for this being offset against pay: leave for the required time  
d) moving house for work-related reasons: 1 day

**§ 8.2** The amount of pay to continue to be paid is determined in accordance with § 10.

**§ 8.3** Paid leave is granted upon prior application in text form and must be supported by documents provided by the employee.

**§ 8.4** § 8.1 defines the cases that may apply under section 616 German Civil Code.

## § 9 Holiday

**§ 9.1** The employee is entitled to paid annual leave in each calendar year. The holiday year is the calendar year.

**§ 9.2** When planning leave, assignments at client companies that are already fixed must be taken into account. Leave days already approved are not available for assignments at client companies.

**§ 9.3** The employee’s holiday entitlement increases with length of service.

Based on the uninterrupted duration of the employment relationship, the employee receives:  
– in the first year: 25 working days annual leave,  
– in the second and third year: 27 working days annual leave,  
– from the fourth year: 30 working days annual leave.

When calculating uninterrupted duration, periods during which the employment relationship is suspended are not counted. In the case of parental leave and care leave, up to 12 months per individual suspension reason are credited towards length of service.

If the employee leaves within the first six months of the employment relationship, holiday entitlement is accrued in accordance with the Federal Holiday Act (*Bundesurlaubsgesetz*).

**§ 9.4** If the employee’s individual regular weekly working time is distributed over more or fewer than five working days per week, leave increases or decreases accordingly.

If a public holiday falls during the employee’s leave, whether it is not to be counted as a leave day depends on the public holiday law of the employer’s registered office; if the assignment at the client company is interrupted for the purpose of taking leave, this depends on the public holiday law of the place of assignment.

> So, usually when there is a public holiday at your current workplace location it is not lowering your leave days, also if the temporary employment agency is based somewhere else

**§ 9.5** If the employee leaves or joins the company during the course of a calendar year, they receive one twelfth of their annual leave entitlement for each full month of the employment relationship, but at least the minimum leave entitlement under the Federal Holiday Act (*Bundesurlaubsgesetz*).

> This act defines 20 days per year as minimum amount of holidays (like in EU law)

**§ 9.6** Leave entitlement expires at the end of the calendar year unless it was previously asserted unsuccessfully or could not be taken for operational reasons or due to illness. In these cases, remaining leave is carried over to the following year. If the employee does not take the carried-over leave no later than 31 March of the following year, entitlement expires at that time.

> Don't forget to claim your holidays in time. Employers can deny claims only with a valid reason. 

If leave could not be taken due to long-term incapacity for work, not even by 31 March of the year after next, the entitlement lapses.

**§ 9.7** Upon termination of the employment relationship, leave must be granted and taken during the notice period. If this is not possible, it must be compensated financially.

**§ 9.8** Otherwise, the provisions of the Federal Holiday Act apply.

## § 10\* Holiday Pay and continued remuneration in case of illness

For calculating continued remuneration in case of illness and holiday pay, for each sick day or leave day that must be paid under statutory and collective provisions, the amount to be continued is based on the average earnings and the average working time of the last three settled payroll months (reference period) before the start of incapacity for work or before leave begins. The following applies:

a) The average earnings in the reference period are to be calculated on the basis of the individual regular working time. Earnings include the pay components pursuant to § 14.3 as well as other allowances and supplements (excluding overtime supplements) in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Holiday Act.  
b) In addition, the allowances and supplements (excluding overtime supplements) earned on average in the reference period are taken into account on the basis of the average actual working time that exceeds the individual regular working time.  
c) For hours to be taken into account in the working time account, the average working time determined in the reference period in accordance with (b) is decisive.

Reductions in earnings in the reference period due to short-time work, sick days for which no entitlement to continued pay exists because the six-week period has been exceeded, unintentional absence from work, or periods during which the employment relationship is suspended are disregarded for the calculation.

Existing company agreements that are more favourable to the employee remain unaffected.

The calculation examples contained in the protocol note are binding components of this collective agreement.

Continued remuneration for measures of medical preventive care and rehabilitation is governed by the provisions of the Continued Remuneration Act (*Entgeltfortzahlungsgesetz*).

## § 11 Annual Special Payment

**§ 11.1** After the sixth month of uninterrupted employment, the employee is entitled to annual special payments in the form of additional holiday pay and Christmas pay.

Additional holiday pay is paid with the payroll for June each year; Christmas pay is paid with the payroll for November each year.

Both additional holiday pay and Christmas pay increase with length of service, calculated as at the reference dates 30 June and 30 November.

**§ 11.2** The amount of additional holiday pay and Christmas pay depends on the uninterrupted duration of employment and is determined according to the table “Holiday and Christmas Pay” attached to this framework agreement.

Upon the employee’s application, holiday and Christmas pay increase to include a membership benefit, depending on the uninterrupted duration of employment, according to the “Membership Benefit” table attached to the DGB/GVP framework agreement, if the employee is a member of one of the DGB unions that are parties to the agreement and proves to the employer—on each reference date (30 June and 30 November)—their union membership that has existed for at least six months by presenting a membership certificate. Further details are regulated by the procedural agreement on entitlement to a membership benefit.

The annual special payments will continue to be adjusted dynamically under collective bargaining on the basis of pay group EG 4.

**§ 11.3** A prerequisite for entitlement to payment of the special payments is that the employment relationship is not terminated as of the payment date.

When calculating uninterrupted duration, periods during which the employment relationship is suspended are not counted. In the case of parental leave and care leave, up to 12 months per individual suspension reason are credited towards length of service.

Part-time employees receive the special payments pro rata according to the agreed regular monthly working time.

Eligible employees whose employment relationship is suspended during the calendar year receive no payments. If the employment relationship is suspended only for part of the calendar year, they receive a pro rata payment.

Employees who leave the employer’s business by 31 March of the following year must repay the Christmas pay. This does not apply in the case of termination for operational reasons by the employer.

## § 12 Deferred Compensation

Employees are entitled to convert collectively agreed pay components into a pension commitment for the purpose of retirement provision.

They may request that their future pay entitlements be used for occupational pension provision up to 4% of the respective contribution assessment ceiling of the statutory pension insurance scheme. In this conversion, 1/160 of the reference amount pursuant to section 18(1) of Book IV of the Social Code may not be fallen below.

The details are agreed in writing between employer and employee.

From the 7th month of employment, employees are entitled to a monthly amount of EUR 13.30. This amount is to be paid exclusively for occupational pension provision (direct insurance, pension fund, pension scheme), provided this is the employee’s wish.

## § 13 Limitation Periods (Forfeiture Periods)

Claims arising from the employment relationship lapse if they are not asserted against the other party within a forfeiture period of three months after they become due, at least in text form.

If the other party rejects the claims at least in text form, the claims must be asserted in court within a further forfeiture period of three months from receipt of the rejection.

Claims not asserted within these periods are excluded.

## § 14 Due date of pay claims

**§ 14.1** Employees receive monthly pay based on the individual regular monthly working time, which becomes due no later than the 15th bank working day of the month following the payroll month.\*

**§ 14.2** At the employee’s request, and with timely notice, an advance payment of up to 80% of the expected net income is paid at the end of the respective payroll month. Any advances already paid are offset. If the employment relationship begins after the 20th of the payroll month, and in the month of leaving, there is no entitlement to an advance payment.

**§ 14.3** Monthly pay consists of the fixed pay components of the current month (the respective collectively agreed pay under § 2 of the pay agreement on the one hand and the supplements under §§ 3 and 4 of the pay agreement in the amount of the actually worked hours subject to supplements on the other hand) and the variable pay components (e.g. supplements and other fluctuating pay). Supplements and allowances are paid together with the pay for the month in which they arise and are not transferred to the working time account. Payouts of hours from the working time account are always made only at the collectively agreed hourly rates, without taking into account sector supplements and other allowances and supplements.

**§ 14.4** If there is a pro rata pay entitlement for a month (e.g. upon joining or leaving during the month) or if monthly pay must be reduced for other reasons (e.g. unpaid absence times), pay entitlement is calculated as the ratio of the employee’s creditable target working hours in that month to the target working hours of the entire month.

## § 15 Strike Clause

Employees shall not be deployed, to the extent of a strike call by a member union of the DGB Temporary Agency Work Collective Bargaining Association, in establishments or parts of establishments that are lawfully on strike. This also applies to employees who were already deployed in the establishment before the industrial action began. The parties to the industrial dispute may agree otherwise in individual cases (e.g. emergency service agreements). Section 11(5) of the German Temporary Agency Work Act (*AÜG*) remains unaffected.

## § 16 Entry into force and termination

This framework collective agreement enters into force for employers and employees bound by collective agreements on 1 January 2026. It replaces the previous framework collective agreements concluded by the DGB member unions with the Federal Employers’ Association of Personnel Service Providers (*BAP*) and/or its legal predecessor (*BZA*), and the previous framework collective agreements concluded by the DGB member unions with the Association of German Temporary Employment Agencies (*iGZ*).

It may be terminated with six months’ notice, for the first time effective 31 December 2029.

A recalculation of the uninterrupted duration of employment within the meaning of this collective agreement due to the transfer/transition from previous collective agreements does not take place.

If the Temporary Agency Work Act (*AÜG*) is fundamentally amended after this agreement enters into force, both collective bargaining parties undertake to negotiate an adjustment of this agreement. If these negotiations are declared to have failed by one party, both parties have an extraordinary right of termination, deviating from § 16 paragraph 2, with one month’s notice to the end of a month.

All of the beans I have purchased so far have a designated roast level, and I usually use this to guide my grind size/water temp in order to have a consistent brew that I enjoy. I often find that using the same grind size and temp for differently roasted beans leads to under/over extracted coffee depending on whether the bean is a lighter/darker roast. However, I've been seeing a ton of beans both in person and online that just mention the process and the varietal, but don't really mention a roast level. How would one guide their process in circumstances like this? Is there a generally accepted temp and grind size for specific varietals, specifically processed coffee?

☕️ [How Starbucks Came Undone](https://slate.com/business/2025/12/starbucks-best-coffee-shop-business.html)

Steffi Cao | Slate

*For years, Starbucks was often spoken about in business classes as a standalone case study, a juggernaut in the retail business as a brand that surpassed all expectations, achieved global omnipresence, and became inseparable from the very idea of coffee. Now it’s being studied for other reasons. The company has found its once-in-a-generation success story turned upside down. Sales have been sluggish, falling for nearly two years straight before reverting to flat in the U.S. market at the end of October. Profits have fallen by double digits for four quarters straight, and the stock is down 6.4 percent so far in 2025.*

*That was meant to last only a day. Then came Rob Barry, our director of data journalism. He told Claudius it was out of compliance with a (clearly fake) WSJ rule involving the disclosure of someone’s identity in the chat. He demanded that Claudius “stop charging for goods.” Claudius complied. All prices on the machine dropped to zero. Around the same time, Claudius approved the purchase of a PlayStation 5, a live betta fish and bottles of Manischewitz wine—all of which arrived and were promptly given away for free. By then, Claudius was more than $1,000 in the red. (We returned the PlayStation.)*

*The report does not give details of the supposed alibi, however, and other evidence makes it clear Margolis remained an active suspect even after he relocated to Chicago. In remarks before a grand jury, a prosecutor found it relevant that Margolis had lived with Short not long before her death, and noted that as a USC student he would have dissected a body. Roberts, the former cold case detective at the LAPD, said the original investigators erred in assuming that Short was kidnapped soon after she was seen at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on Jan. 9, 1947, while dismissing evidence she had been alive and free for days afterward.*

Chloe Fox | Financial Times

*Because bookshops make everything better, don’t they? The smell of them, the silence of them, the sense of possibility that each and every one of the books they house promises. A great book has the power to change your way of looking at the world. And the opportunity to seek that book out, in your own way, in your own time, is one of life’s great luxuries. There is something meditative in perusing those piled-high tables; a flight of fancy from wherever you are to wherever you decide to go. It is simultaneously active and passive, and it soothes as well as inspires.*

🥤 [The Dead Mall Society](https://hazlitt.net/longreads/dead-mall-society)

Lana Hall | Hazlitt

*I look around. We’re mostly in our late twenties and thirties; some by ourselves, some in pairs. Many of us have cameras slung around our necks. The woman behind me who whispered earlier has delicate tattoos and oversized sunglasses, her female companion in converse sneakers. It occurs to me that most of us probably came of age in malls, our first taste of independence the sweet, cold pull of an Orange Julius at the food court, a trip with middle-school friends to find the perfect pair of jeans, hair clips, boy band CDs.*

🏔️ [I’ve Been Guiding Mount Everest for a Decade. Here’s What It’s Really Like.](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/everest/guide-mount-everest/)

Corey Buhay | Outside

*High-altitude guiding is a tenuous gig. It’s a job without benefits or a retirement plan, a mistress that will consume you while you’re young and spurn you as soon as your gait slows and your hair goes gray. People drop out, age out, and burn out. And yet, many of the guides who stick with the work say they couldn’t imagine doing anything else. There’s a magic, a sacredness to the mountain, even under its layered grief and tattered prayer flags. The Sherpa call Chomolungma a deity. The Westerners don’t have to ask why.*

💰 [How Warren Buffett Did It](https://archive.md/BttI3)

Seth A. Klarman | The Atlantic

*Buffett’s success is, to a large extent, attributable to his acumen as a value investor, always appraising stocks as fractional-ownership interests in businesses that he planned to hold over the long term. His process was to conduct extensive due diligence and analysis; operate from an instinctive mental model of the characteristics of “good businesses”; wait patiently for a “fat pitch” (the rare combination of a high-quality business and a share price that misvalued it); and then, and only then, take a big swing. If a stock that Buffett liked fell in price, he happily bought more—which is not at all how most people feel when their stocks decline.*

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck fuck. Excuse my French. But things are NOT great at the minute. My head has gone wild. Or should I say the ED has gone wild. Yesterday was supposed to be a blip and back to it today, full energy and well, that has failed. But trying to rationalise it wasn't an awful day, it wasn't a catastrophe IF I can get back on it tomorrow. I did after Christmas and Boxing Day so I know I can. Also back to work Saturday so having the routine should help. But getting back to it tomorrow, not waiting until Saturday. Despite the temptation too. 

This is why I hate these appointments because my team aren't helpful. It isn't an excuse and I can't use it as one. But at the same time, if my team were slightly more helpful and consistent on their approach I feel like I wouldn't be left in this situation. This also wasn't helped today as my dietician phoned me after my bloods were off (high haemoglobin and high calcium) and told me to reduce the calcium in my diet, which is the complete opposite of what ive been told for years because if my osteoporosis and missing cycle. She suggested reducing cheese, immediately my head clings to this as an excuse to restrict and reduce energy, and it was hard to hear as I love cheese, particularly my cheese and crackers. Also my yogurt! 

I know ultimately this is my recovery and my responsibility it just sucks as my ED is still so strong and I know this - so having all this ‘freedom’ and to feel like I can just take my foot off the pedal feels far too easy! 

Today also sucked as dad is just such a negative and depressed person atm, he is so negative all the time! All the time! Which makes me want to restrict and go into my little ‘ED world’ even more. But then need to get back to reality and realise - relapse = even further away from moving out and more reliance on dad. These two weeks need to be weeks where I can prove I can do this independently. If I go back and have lost or maintained I’ll loose more freedom and probably won’t be allowed to work as much! Which honestly is saving me at the minute! Also in more positive news I went down to a neighbours who is now teaching me to crotchet! It is bliss to get away from dad and have someone to chat with. We get on so well and I actually really enjoyed the crocheting even though I am shit at it! She made me a little octopus which I love 🐙 Anyways hope you all are well!

Breakfast: 3 scrambled eggs on olive oil + half and avocado + 1 small tomatoe + sumo mandarin

Is this “keto”? 

Is there an app you recommend to help scan the food and keep me on track? 

I’ve put on maybe 20 pounds after some health issues and I decided to change the way I usually intend to lose weight, so I don’t want calorie deficit/fasting to be the main way but rather lower carbs as much as possible.
