1onxwhc,https://v.redd.it/vpsnv7nm06zf1,We’re launching a new ultra-portable controller for handheld gaming - would love your thoughts,"Hey everyone,  
I’m part of a small team that’s been working on a new kind of **magnetic, ultra-portable controller** called **M4** \- designed for players who like to game anywhere, not just at a desk.

It can attach directly to your phone or detach to play wirelessly. We’ve been testing it in different scenarios - from flights to coffee shops -and the flexibility has been the biggest win so far.

We’re getting ready to **launch soon**, and I’d love to hear what this community thinks about the idea of truly pocket-sized controllers.  
Do you still prefer a full-size handheld, or something modular like this?

Kafka brokers drifting, Postgres replicas lagging, disks filling up again. The stack worked, but every small issue pulled someone off real work. Upgrades felt like outages, and nobody touched infra unless something was already on fire.

Moving everything to Aiven didn’t erase the problems, but it shifted the focus. Broker recovery, failover, and monitoring now sit under one platform, so we spend more time looking at traffic patterns and schema design instead of broker logs. Kafka, Postgres, and Redis all live in the same managed space, and Terraform keeps it consistent with the rest of our infrastructure code.

The workflow feels cleaner. A new Kafka topic or Postgres database is just another Terraform pull request. CI runs drift detection, the Aiven provider keeps the plan output stable, and we don’t waste hours arguing about whose cluster failed this time. Most of our conversations now revolve around throughput, cost, and retention instead of recovery.

It’s not perfect. ACLs, schema registry rules, and scaling limits still need care, but the daily noise dropped a lot. Instead of juggling dashboards and hoping for the best, we get one clear view in Grafana across every service.

I like cigars, mountains, music. I'm not big into sports, know nothing of farming or cows. I like hanging out, playing cards, and swapping stories. I like meeting at a restaurant and hanging out drinking coffee. I like the easy hiking and small festivals around the towns here. I'm open to trying new things, learning new games, etc.

I'm not looking for a sexual relationship. My priorities in life are not there and I'm not the one your hunting for. I promise I'll disappoint you and you'll regret it. I don't like druggies, if you're a local meth/fentanyl/gas station druggy I'm not interested. I'm a fairly clean person and I would prefer you to be as well. I do not mind alcohol or weed, I'm not a big drinker but will have a drink at times.

Now that I've made myself sound no fun, any takers? I'm open to anyone, any age (no minors). I'm 40 and male, veteran, and I'm not that pretty. I really enjoy stories, in the end I think our lives accumulate to a collection of stories and a pile of junk. I'm a lover and not a fighter. I like deeper conversations and where they can go. If you are a fighter I prefer we smoke a cigar after and BS about bending spacetime or the collapse of a modern free society into a techno-authoritarianism. I'm retired from fighting. I have a sense of humor, it's just not that funny and it's hard to tell when I'm joking.

While I know nothing of farms and cows, I'm also not really a hunter. I subsistence hunt, but that's it. I am rural, I guess more mountainman than farmer. I don't have those useful skills, I can ride a horse over a cliff into a river though. The secret is to hang on, that's about it.

Are there any apps that allow you to walk deliveries over to people/don't care if you walk deliveries to people.

Hi, I’m Shahana Sherin S, a passionate digital marketing professional based in Perinthalmanna, originally from the culturally vibrant town of Koppam, Kerala. I’m a proud graduate of Calicut University, and I created Digitensi with one clear purpose:



To empower brands to build visibility, foster engagement, and thrive in the digital world.



Whether you’re here to explore my work, understand what I do, or find the right partner to elevate your brand — thank you for stopping by and being part of this journey.



My Journey: From Koppam to Digitensi



My story begins in Koppam, a small town that shaped my values of creativity, purpose, and community. Growing up surrounded by stories, culture, and connection, I developed a deep love for communication — a passion that eventually led me to the world of digital marketing.



After earning my degree from Calicut University, I dove into the ever-evolving digital landscape. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with brands, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, helping them:



Tell compelling brand stories



Reach the right audiences



Build meaningful online relationships



For me, marketing is not just about promotion — it’s about connection, creativity, and long-term brand growth. That belief is at the heart of everything I do at Digitensi.



What I Do at Digitensi



As a full-spectrum digital marketing professional, I design strategies that are customized, data-driven, and results-oriented. My goal is to help your brand not only be seen — but remembered for the right reasons.



 Social Media Marketing



From content calendars to community engagement, I create campaigns that spark conversations, grow brand loyalty, and drive measurable results. Whether it’s Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn, I make sure your brand stands out with authenticity and creativity.



 Search Engine Optimization (SEO)



Visibility matters. I use proven SEO techniques to help your website rise in search rankings, increase organic traffic, and achieve long-term visibility — ensuring your audience finds you when it matters most.



Content Marketing



Every brand has a story worth telling. From blogs and web copy to social media content, I craft clear, meaningful, and engaging messages that reflect your brand’s voice and resonate with your audience.



Email Marketing



Email is still one of the most powerful marketing tools. I design strategic, personalized email campaigns that nurture leads, convert subscribers into loyal customers, and strengthen existing relationships with value-packed content.



 Digital Strategy & Analytics



Every successful campaign is backed by data. Using tools like Google Analytics, Meta Business Suite, and other digital platforms, I create strategies guided by real insights — helping brands optimize performance and maximize return on investment.



Why Choose Digitensi?



There are many digital marketers out there — but Digitensi stands out because of its philosophy, approach, and values.



Local Roots, Global Mindset



Grounded in Kerala’s cultural richness and inspired by global best practices, I bring a culturally aware yet globally relevant perspective to your brand.



Custom Strategies, Not Templates



Every brand has its own identity — so why settle for cookie-cutter marketing? I take time to understand your goals and craft strategies that reflect your unique voice and business vision.



Creative Meets Data



Marketing should be both beautiful and intelligent. I blend creativity with analytics-driven thinking to deliver campaigns that have both heart and measurable impact.



 Continuous Learning



The digital world is constantly changing — and so am I. I stay updated with the latest tools, trends, and techniques to ensure your brand stays ahead of the curve and achieves consistent, sustainable success.

1onxcg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1onxcg3/misbehaved_by_an_international_student/,Misbehaved by an international student- apartmentmate,"So, straight; I am here in the US doing my master and an international student (Nepal). I shared my apartment with 3 other international students and they are from Nigeria. To get this particular unit, one of them had contacted me while I was back in my country. We have 4 bed 2 bath, and I share bathroom with the one who contacted me. I had other friends in this university living in different housing and they were asking me to live with them but due to the friendly approach of my current roommate, I planned to live with them.

Fast forward, among 3 of them, 2 of them ( Say A- who contacted and B) are really nice, they communicate with me well even I am an introvert, makes joke, invite sometime to share  their food or even give me a ride share. But there is this guy, say C, who seemed so non-chalant from the begining. I sometime tried to share the greetings but he was to cold to response. I just let that pass as I am also not that talkative. But things got exacerbating from September. One day I was cooking in the kitchen; he came and started to make a weird noise (seemed like to assert the dominance), also later that day, I was talking with B and he came and mimicked my pronunciation and voice tone (as I am kind of soft spoken- but not feminine), I asked him ""are you alright?"" And be did not say anything. I did not proceed much as he was too drunk.

Fast forward today, while I was going to my University, (early morning), I saw him in our shared room. I was having quick coffee before leaving, and he went outside the door of the shared/common room which leads to a balcony, and he started using phone or sth. After I finished coffee, I was about to close the door of the main gate of the apartment, which is completely opposite and front of the living room, I saw his shadow and he was showing me the middle finger ""F*CK"" sign, which was clearly visible to me. There was a door curtain so he might have thought I could not see but as it was early morning, shadow was pretty lucid. 

Since then, I am quite stuck with this thought and incident in my mind. I have never ever did any harm to him, I even had shared some professor names who were recruiting grad students, so his partner could sent them email from Nigeria. I do not know if this things are common in their culture, but from where I belong, this sign are not consider friendly banters and refer as very clear offensive behavior. I am a peace loving person, and I was enjoying my life in this apartment till today, but since morning, this has changed and I am having quite uneasy feeling living here. 
I do vacuum, cleaning of kitchen all by myself must of the time for all the shared space, and I absolutely do not have complain on that too.So, there is not any conflict on resource use and sanitation as long as I can think 

I am trying to add all the dots in my mind to find why he is behaving like that but I am not being able to find a single clue. How can I cope up with that.???


(More input; I have somehow not a top notch command of English while doing conversation 7 in IELTS speaking, but I feel I am adapting well.. Other two roommates are completely fine and I adore them. All of them have GF and they bring them every week, they will have big party with a lot of loud singing and dancing every Thursday night till 3 am in the morning and I do not care, it gives me somehow homely vibes.

We're in Norman Park and usually host board game nights at ours where a few people come over, have some drinks, play games, and hang out with our very lazy greyhound. My partner and I, plus our mates are an eclectic bunch of people. 

If you're ever up for joining in or grabbing a coffee sometime, shoot me a message. And if you're a girl looking for more female friends, message me and I'll link you up with my partner.

Just putting it out there for anyone who's keen to meet some new people and hang out.

Please no weird stuff. We are only looking for mates, not dates 😂",1,1762227829.0,BrisbaneSocial,4,0.6,False

I’ve learned over the years of drinking coffee that I’m definitely a dark roast kind of guy. I don’t like fruit flavored or really acidic flavor profiles— I definitely go for the rich, dark, chocolatey flavors.

Now, I have a Breville Bambino and I still have yet to fall in love with the espresso I’m pulling from it. It’s probably because I don’t know how to pull a good shot / I’m using a not-so-good roast.

Curious to know a few things:

1. What are some good, top-notch dark roasts that would work well with a Breville Bambino (I live in the USA if that matters) 
2. How can I pull a good shot without a scale? ",1,1762227821.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I'm so stuck in my own little world, with friends who don't throw birthday parties, that these little social rules have completely evaded me for three decades 😂

As I get older, people seem to like me a bit more despite my quirks, so I've been invited to a couple of these parties where I discover that I need to pay between $80-100+ either at the restaurant or a few days before the thing, long after I'd accepted the invite.

My folks never threw birthday parties for me when I was a kid. This year, I took a day off work, took myself out for coffee, visited a museum, got ice cream, and read by the river.

Growing up, whenever I attended parties, it was always catered and guests were never expected to pay for it. I would also not feel comfortable inviting friends and asking them to fork out so much money for my birthday, but then again, I'm the weird one!

Please educate me on proper social etiquette! I'm struggling so much to fit in as a ""professional"" adult woman who still feels very much like a little misfit 😂😭",3,1762227668.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

In a recent podcast, he explained how AI search works — and why digital PR and helpful content are more important than ever.

**AI Thinks Like a Human Researcher**

When you ask Google’s AI a question, it doesn’t pull from a magic database.

It runs real Google searches — just like a person would.

* “Best coffee shops in Seattle?” → AI searches for top lists, reviews, and articles.
* “Top marketing tools for startups?” → AI looks for roundups, expert mentions, and trusted sources.

**Key Insight**:

“If you’re a business mentioned in top lists or public articles that people find, those become useful for the AI to discover.” – Robby Stein

**Translation**: **Digital PR = AI fuel.**

**PR Isn’t Just Branding — It’s AI SEO**

Getting featured in:

* Industry roundups
* Local “best of” lists
* News articles
* Expert guides

isn’t just vanity. It’s a **direct signal** to AI systems.

Even if your friends don’t see the article **the AI does**.

And it uses those mentions to decide who to recommend.

**Helpful Content Still Wins (AI Included)**

Stein doubled down:

The same best practices for clear, helpful content apply in the AI age.

Your page ranks in regular search?  
→ Higher chance of being pulled into AI answers.

AI scans top results, reads context, and cites the **most helpful** ones.

**Pro Move**: Write like you’re answering a curious friend — not a robot.

**AI Search ≠ Traditional SEO**

|Traditional SEO|AI Search|
|:-|:-|
|Short keywords|Long, specific questions|
|Text-only|Voice, images, live chat|
|Rank = win|Helpful + context = citation|

**Rising Trends**:

* How do I fix a leaky faucet without tools?
* Show me home offices under $500 (with image upload)
* Voice searches with full sentences

Optimize for intent, not just keywords.

**Reviews? AI Sees Through Noise**

Paid reviews? Risky.

Stein’s take:

Think like a human Googling what shows up at the top? That’s what matters.

AI favors reliable, helpful signals. Fake fluff gets ignored (or penalized).

**Tools to Spy on AI Users**

Stein’s go-tos:

* **Google Trends** → Real-time spikes
* **Search Console** → Actual user queries
* **Google Ads Planner** → Volume + intent clues

**Hack**: Search your niche in AI chat (Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity) — see what sources win.

**The Future: More AI Search Data for All**

Google plans to share **what people ask AI** not just advertisers.

Expect:

* Top AI questions
* Voice/image search trends
* Multimodal intent data

**Get ready**: Image SEO and voice optimization are about to matter *a lot*.

**Your AI Visibility Checklist**

|Task|Why It Matters|
|:-|:-|
|Pitch for “best of” lists|AI trusts curated roundups|
|Create in-depth guides|Answers complex questions|
|Add rich image alt text|Preps for visual search|
|Monitor Google Trends weekly|Catch rising voice queries|
|Build real reviews|Fuels trust signals|

**TL;DR**

AI doesn’t know — it searches.

Win by:

* Getting mentioned (PR)
* Being helpful (content)
* Speaking human (long, voice, image queries)

1onx6ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1onx6ud/have_ive_been_used/,Have I've been used,"Hi, I'm 33 male and I've been with my partner for amost 5 years but today everthing ended. After our dauther was born 3 years and a half ago everything changed as my partner who was always looking for s*x stopped giving me attention, I thought that was normal due to the circumstances and with the baby crying at night. I admit I should have been more caring within those times but we never addressed any of that. Everytime I wanted to spend some time with her when she went to bathroom she was always rushing back to the baby, as she was either tired or stated the baby would wake up any moment to be eat.

 Moving forward to when  my partner(ex) started work again part time and I moved my shift to make sure our daughter is cared we barely seen eachother as when she got home I was then leaving as I needed to get to work.

After a few months she decided to test if I still care for her in a sick matter I believe, by ""faking"" an affair with her team leader at the time with all the messages as it was a new relationship and sneaky coffee meetups before work. The guy was apparently in the same situation with his wife.I don't know who came up with the idea but after Christmas we had a big fight after I found out.

We expressed all our feelings, and to be honest now thinking about it I feel like it was me who did most of that as I completely openned my heart to her. She kept insisting it was to test out if I still care about her and if she still cared about me. At that point she swore that nothing happened and everything would stop between them. 

Exept it didn't a few weeks into the new year and she was still talking to the guy behind my back deleting all record, all messages, everything. Once I caught her we had another break where she was supposed to decide if she still wants to be togheter or not. As it was around Valentines day i brought her a perfume and gave it to her and for some reason she decided to keep going on although I was convinced from eveything I've seen that she was in love with the guy, but I thought I could still win her over.

 After all this a few months later after some test she discovered she has Wolf Parkins White, a heart condition that at times increases the heartbeat and she had a procedure to resolve this like two months ago, 

I don't know if it's this failed pricedure that made her think about everything and if she is happy and all of that but it feels that way as shes afraid that one day she will die and not accomplished what she wants, as often she was distant and cold, I was trying to cuddle while she was just scrolling on tiktok.


While discussing our situation and the breakup she claimed that she has that many plans, ideas and things she wants to try that a 20 years old person would never have, which is strange as she always claims she is tired due to her condition and the activities/work during the day.

Looking all back I have the feeling that I was used, from the begining of the relationship it looked like she wanted to get pregnant as soon as possible and I was a shy person, she actually started the conversation and asked for a date, within 2 months she was moved in the flat I was renting at the time.

What do you guys thing? Was I used as now it feels like her feelings for me dissapeared way too quick.

1onx6tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatelygranolamoms/comments/1onx6tr/sugar_alternatives_coffee_decoys_toddler_keeps/,sugar alternatives? coffee decoys? toddler keeps demanding my coffee.,"So to be clear, I cook and serve her whole foods, fruits and vegetables, dad bakes sourdough from scratch, if we need a sweetener for a baked good we use maple syrup or honey.

But I like a little stevia in my coffee, and LO is OBSESSED with getting some from my mug.

I've been trying to cut back on sweeteners (the stevia is a step down from stevia with ethritol) and I really only let her have a sip or my empty cup, but I wonder how bad the artificial sweeteners, to say nothing of the caffine are for her?

I just got an ad for ""kid coffee"" which looked promising (for me, in the afternoon, to replace my decaf) but it had monkfruit mixed in.

Any knowledge on how bad stevia vs monkfruit is for kids? Any thing to shock some sense into me about the risks of letting my 19 month old have even a minuscule amount of caffine? 

Any decoy recipes? Everything store bought (hot chocolate) either has so much added sugar or artificial sweetener that I'm loathe to purchase it. LO will no longer be disracted by warm milk in the same type of cup.

When I first posted about Coffee, I honestly didn’t know if anyone would notice. But the way everyone came together donating, sharing, sending love and kind words. It truly means a lot. 🙏

Because of you all, Coffee’s treatment and medicines are now fully covered. He’s doing better and getting the care he deserves.

Your help made it possible for Coffee to continue his treatment with proper care, medicine, and comfort. ❤️

For now, we’re not accepting any more donations, as the full goal is complete of his previous treatment has been completed. 
If there’s any new medical need or expense next month, I’ll share an update again with full transparency, just like before.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping an old indie dog live his remaining days with comfort and dignity. 🐾❤️

Crying, honestly 🙏

You people literally gave Coffee and me hope that yes, we can take care of him properly without worrying about anything. I was so stressed until yesterday. We animal lovers might rescue dogs, but we all have our own struggles to deal with. Still, when I look at Coffee, my problems feel so small compared to his real health struggles.

Whether it’s an animal or a human, if you’re healthy and able to move freely, believe me, your other life problems are so temporary. So please, take care of your community dogs and your own health. ❤️

Coffee’s struggle is unimaginable. He’s lived on the streets since birth, and street life is never kind to anyone. That’s why I always say — please, adopt indies. So that if they somehow survive till the age of 10–11, they don’t have to keep suffering the way Coffee and so many others do on the roads. 🐾

Indians have literally rocked for indie animals.

I got her number. We texted back and forth a few texts and then I set up a date to meet her. She seemed enthusiastic over text to meet me.

Few days later we met for a coffee. We chatted for a bit at the coffee shop then I suggested we take a walk. We walked a bit and then we sat somewhere private. I tried to give her a kiss but she denied. She’s born and raised in Japan and she said it’s not common to kiss so early on. She’s been in the country only for 3 weeks at this point and will stay for 1 year.

As we continue talking, her stomach loudly grumbles (LOL) so I suggest we get food. We get some sushi, we eat, chat etc. I thought everything went well. I didn’t get the opportunity to go for a kiss again. 

I dropped her off and then waited one week to text her (I was genuinely busy). 

I had the below exchange with her that honestly surprised me because she seemed very happy and enthusiastic (i think?). 

Is there any chance she was testing me and I failed? Her response kind of stung so perhaps I suggested “we should not meet” too abruptly?
Do you think she will ever get back to me?

I don’t plan to message her again. I’ve been going on other dates but this one stung a bit since I genuinely liked this girl and thought she liked me too. 

Text exchange:

Me:
Hi [Her name], how are you doing?

Her:
Hi I’m good!

Me:
Which day are you free this week? Let’s meet

Her:
Just to be clear, I’m not looking for anything romantic or physical. So what do you expect from meeting up?
Sorry if that made you uncomfortable.

Me:
It’s okay I understand. I think we are looking for different things. Maybe we should not meet

1onx006,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1onx006/it_followed_me_home_from_work_part_1/,It followed me home from work (Part 1),"	Again I sat behind the wheel of my dodge grand caravan, a winding serpent of brake lights as far as the eye could see ahead of me. The route home from the office during peak traffic was miserable, but at least at home I had happiness waiting for me. The joy of a home-cooked meal, light conversation with my wife and my little boy jabbering away as he chucked his army men around, recreating imaginary battles in his head he had fought with his friends from preschool.

	I was not a man with lots of money, but I was rich.

	I looked at the clock again, watching the minutes past five push ever onward. There were other ways to get home, sure, but every road that seemed to move quickly with the flow of traffic only worked out to be the same time it would have taken me to sit on Lakehead.

	Lakehead was a street that traveled directly from my office parking garage, winding its way through the downtown core and eventually leading off into a small section of subdivisions where I lived. The drive from my apartment was about seven minutes, forty three seconds, or twelve minutes ten seconds if I decided to stop at the coffee shop for a bagel and java. If I followed Lakehead home the same way I found myself to work, it always, *always* was thirty four minutes on the dot.

	I tried leaving ten minutes early from my shift to make up the time later, staying ten minutes late to wait for the rush of oncoming traffic to cease its congestion, I even started praying to God in his infinite wisdom to will it to me the ‘grace of good traffic’ by the time my shift was over. I couldn’t complain though, He gave me everything else a man could ask for, so the thirty four minutes I considered a test when I eventually got used to it.

	There were attempts to kill time while driving, filling the gap with audio books or podcasts of people who would read to me educational wish fullfilment. I found a couple that were interesting, but not enough to keep me focused away from the annoyance of brake lights in my windshield. There was a time when anger would fuel me, and whatever stub of a short fuse I had lit that day would come out in traffic. The embarrassing honking, shouting, and cursing I would spit filled up the van with a cloud of malice that often would have passers by look toward the deranged fellow who should have maybe decided to take the long way home. Stubborn as I was, I packed my foolishness away through grit teeth and the knowledge that at the end of the long journey home, there was also always a pot of gold at the end of this monochromatic rainbow.

	One overcast day in November though, the commute was nothing compared to what would happen to me.

	I remember the specifics, but am foggy on the journey. It was late at night, but early enough to continue to benefit from sleep when my son Joshua woke at two in the morning. Josh was three, but gifted in a sense that he already had mastery of the English language as much as a three year old could have. My wife Florence rolled over and elbowed me in the ribs after I pretended not to hear Josh’s anguished cries. From what I could tell, they were overly dramatic and after ten minutes he would soon settle.

	“Harry, it's been twenty minutes.”

	“Alright.” She didn’t need to say anymore, nor did I. I got up and quickly dressed with whatever clothes were at the foot of our bed. I could hear Josh repeat himself in whimpers from behind his closed door. He repeatedly said the word ‘no’ through high pitched gasping breaths, and extended wails.

	“Hey buddy.” I tried to be as comforting as possible while opening his door. Josh, who was still yet to graduate to a toddler bed practically scrambled over the crib and leapt into my arms. I hugged him close as he dried his wet face on my t-shirt. “Hey, what’s the matter son?” I asked him a few times before through his dry heaving he answered muffled into my chest, simply pointing at his bedroom window.

	“Face. Daddy. Face window.” He wouldn’t look toward his curtains, though they were drawn, but I did my best to calm him. Based on how he was reacting, I decided it would be best if he slept in our bed for the duration of the night.

	“Hey my little man, daddy and I are here, you’re gonna be okay.” Flo mouthed the words ‘What the fuck?’. I responded with a shrug and pointed to our curtains, then made my move to regain any sleep before I needed to get to work.

	“Daddy, close the window.” Josh said as I walked back to my side of the bed. I sighed and did as he asked, shutting my window tight and drawing the blackout curtain.

	“Be right back buddy, you snuggle in with mom. I’m just gonna go deal with your window too, okay?”

	“‘Kay.” I stepped into his room as my wife sang to our frightened boy, wondering what it was that he saw. I know our neighbors next to us had a deck that was about window height, but they were far enough away that any ‘faces’ would be attached to the rest of their bodies. Josh knew this when we waved at them from his room the day they moved in. I brought my hand up to his closed curtain, as my fingers crept closer to the middle I felt my heart beat rapidly in my chest. I paused, taking a moment to catch my breath. I reached forward again with the same results. 

	“Fuck this.” I muttered, grasping the middle of the curtain and pulling it hard to the right expecting to see a morbid expression awaiting me on the other side of the window. There was next to nothing there, well, *almost* nothing. The soft tiki lights around our neighbors deck gave off enough illumination that I could make out the residue on the exterior of Josh’s window. It was as if someone had their hands cupped to peek inside my son's room.

It’s not always “just stress.”,"Lately, “cortisol” feels like social media’s favorite buzzword — but what *i*s it really, and what does it mean for women navigating hormonal changes?

Cortisol isn’t the enemy. It’s your body’s built-in alarm system — meant to protect you, not punish you. But when it stays high for too long (thanks to constant stress, under-eating, poor sleep, or overtraining), it can quietly throw off everything from your mood to your metabolism.

During perimenopause, this becomes even more complicated. Shifts in estrogen and progesterone can make your stress response more sensitive — which is why so many women feel “wired but tired,” wake up in the middle of the night, or notice stubborn belly weight that doesn’t budge.

The good news? You can lower cortisol in smart, sustainable ways that don’t involve quick fixes or strict rules. Think:

* Nourishing before you push (protein, steady meals, no coffee-for-breakfast days)
* Gentle movement and real rest days
* Quality sleep that actually resets your stress system
* Managing your mental load and nervous system safety cues

We break all of this down here: [How to Lower Cortisol: The Smart, Sustainable Way to Reset Your Stress Response](https://waveswomen.com/how-to-lower-cortisol-smart-sustainable-stress-relief/)

If you’ve been seeing “cortisol” everywhere lately and wondering how it actually connects to your hormones or energy, we hope this article helps explain it a little more!

Fixed matches. But obviously you went out there ashamed like a dog to play.""

He explained further in the podcast that none of the players were behind this, it only came from the president himself and the head coach. And more so for a competetive advantage than anything to do with betting, from what he could tell.

– In Volos, the curtain stayed open. We even heard from the away team's supporters as we were sitting and drinking coffee that ""is it 3-0 today or not?"" Then we looked at each other and were just 'Okay, I guess it's gonna be then...' - then it was 3-0.",2,1762226423.0,soccer,1,1.0,False

The Food
We ate at many different places to get a good idea of what we liked. We loved Sorrento’s — it was the first lunch we had once we got on the ship. We also tried the Main Dining Room (MDR) for dinner, which was super disappointing, although the service there was amazing. The one thing we really disliked was that the main manager came over and gave us a five-minute lecture about giving them 10-star reviews. We understand a quick reminder, but he went on and on.

We only tried the buffet for breakfast, and it was very mediocre. We also ate at Izumi for sushi, which ended up being our favorite meal of the whole trip. Our server there was fantastic!

We also tried Jamie’s for lunch. It was good for a midday meal, but I wouldn’t pay the higher dinner prices. We ordered room service for both breakfast and dinner, and we enjoyed both experiences. I had the deluxe drink package, but the coffee/lattes were bad — especially at Café Promenade.

The Good
Many of the employees were friendly, and the ship was kept very clean. The bars and venues looked really nice, and the live music was excellent. The Seaplex was a lot of fun and offered plenty of activities. The rock climbing was really fun!

Our room attendant had a bit of an attitude the first night — things were a little hectic with our kids, so we didn’t have time to tip right away. Once we tipped him, his attitude completely changed.

The Bad
There wasn’t much to do. We tried going to some of the activities, but they felt like an afterthought. More than half of the activities listed on the daily calendar were sales pitches that we avoided. The “arts and crafts” activity turned out to just be coloring pages. Most of the arcade games weren’t working, and the iFly experience wasn’t available. The bowling game in the Seaplex wasn’t working either, even though it still took our money.

Another downside we noticed was that every time we tried to call from our room — whether for room service or something simple we needed (which wasn’t often) — the call would ring for a couple of minutes and then disconnect or time out. We had to call seven or eight times each time before finally reaching someone.

The Ugly
This issue completely turned us off from ever wanting to sail with Royal Caribbean again. Someone nearby was constantly smoking weed on their balcony (and cigarettes at times), and the smell would drift straight into our room. We couldn’t use our balcony at all — even though we paid extra for it — because it reeked so badly. Even with the balcony door closed, the smell would fill our entire room.

We had our kids with us, and one of them has asthma, so this was especially concerning. He was coughing throughout the night because of it. Our room smelled so bad that one of our kids was whimpering while the other was coughing. My husband and I are pretty sure we all ended up with an unwanted contact high.

We tried calling guest services the first night — it took around ten tries just to get through — and the employee said they would take care of it, but nothing happened.

The second day, we called security because we couldn’t even sit outside for breakfast. The officer who came said he could smell it, offered us chocolate-covered strawberries (which we declined), and said he’d handle it. Still, nothing changed.

We called security a third time because the smoking continued, and even the hallway outside our room smelled. They knocked on the door of the room they thought the smoke was coming from but the guest said they are only smoking cigarettes and not weed. That time, the officer claimed there was “no proof,” so they couldn’t do anything. No one is going to admit they are smoking weed so that was super frustrating. 
In the end, we essentially paid for a balcony room that we never got to enjoy the entire cruise, and it left a very bad taste in our mouths that no one made a real effort to help us.

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/s/QR5AmksoW7

1st update: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/s/gED4NNv7ED


It’s been just over two months since my first update so I thought I’d give an update on what’s been happening since then. 

After I told her I found it hot we’ve been trying to find ways to incorporate it in to our lives. I suggested hosting a poker night and she can be a topless waitress for that. She really liked that idea. Then it came to who to invite. We agreed on a couple of friends but still had our reservations and in the end decided it would be best not to include friends in this just yet.

We decided it would have to be strangers but couldn’t think how we would even get that idea off the ground. Then my wife came up with a great idea. Try a swingers website. We signed up and posted a couple of standard photos of her and then made an ad explaining what we wanted which was five strangers to come round and play poker while my wife walked around topless and served drinks, snacks and cigars. We said nothing physical would happen just a chill night and you get to see some boobs. 

It got a lot of responses until someone commented saying it sounds like a scam to win a load of money from strangers by distracting them with my wife’s tits lol. So we had a talk and agreed to fund the whole night and pay for hotels if anyone wanted to get drunk and not drive home. So we rewrote the advert and said we’d give every player £100 to gamble with and would book five rooms at the local Premier Inn for the guests to stay at and we’d pay for taxis there and back. 

We got around 200 replies! My wife narrowed it down to around 20 people she thought sounded good and she ended up picking five to chat to about coming and said we’d drive to them and meet them for a coffee and a chat to see how we got on before they came round to our house. We devised a plan where I would leave to go to the toilet at one point and see what they were like once my wife was alone with them. Four of them were great but one of them as soon as I was gone gave her a bit of paper with his number on and started asking her to get her phone out and show him any nudes she had on her phone. We had to replace him which we did fine. 

After all the planning we were finally ready to host the night on 1st November. It went great! It started at 6pm and went on until 2 in the morning and we all got on fine and we made some good friends! The poker went down well although I was the first one bust as I couldn’t concentrate properly lol. My wife was a brilliant waitress and managed to earn some of my money back in tips lol. She wore 7 different outfits in total with the most popular one by far being denim hot pants, knee high boots and a cowboy hat haha. 

I won’t go in to too much detail as that’s not what this sub is about but all in all we had a fantastic night and we both really enjoyed it and I’m so glad I told her how much the original picture turned me on! ",1,1762226248.0,WhatShouldIDo,5,0.55,False

I'm on my 15th week, at 7.5 mg currently, and lost 30 lbs so far. 

My biggest side effects have been food aversion and mild fatigue, especially after I started 5 mg. I don't like protein shakes, so I struggled with things to eat at first.

Here are some quick and easy food ideas that work for me. These are not necessarily low calorie options or anything, just things I've been able to enjoy (or at least tolerate). You can mix and match. I'm listing brands, flavors, and combos that work for me, but you can choose others.

🥚 Breakfast: String cheese and hard boiled egg, McDonald's Egg McMuffin, Kind peanut butter clusters and walnuts, banana and peanut butter, Balanced Breaks - almond, cheese, cranberries.

🥗 Lunch or dinner: Panera chicken noodle soup and salad, Longhorn steak salad or strawberry chicken salad with baked potato, Kraft mac and cheese cup mixed with chicken from a pouch and frozen baby peas (cooked), Chick fil a chicken wrap, chili, spaghetti, pulled pork, Bare chicken bites on romaine lettuce with Colby Jack shredded cheese and litehouse blue cheese salad dressing.

 🥨 Snacks: Chobani mixed berry yogurt, carrots and celery, apple, cottage cheese, Smart popcorn, plain M and M's or peppermint patty (one fun size). Some of the breakfast items can be snacks, too.

🍶Drinks: Hot honey lemon water, Tazo Zen tea, Schweppes ginger ale, Bubly lime water, Liquid IV lemon lime (for electrolytes), coffee in moderation, and LOTS of regular water.

⏰ I created reminders for lunch and dinner. I used to eat when I got hungry, but I can't do that now. Reminding myself to eat has helped with fatigue and nausea. 

☕ For many years, I had the same breakfast with coffee every day but not since Zepbound. In fact, I used to drink coffee several times a day. Not anymore! I'm down to about half a coffee. I'm sure it's better for me not to have all that caffeine, but I miss the comfort of the hot drink. I drink hot honey lemon water or tea, but it's not the same.

The rise of the **affordable machine washable rug** has completely changed the game. It’s the hero every home with kids, pets, or just plain clumsy humans has been waiting for. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about finding the perfect one for your space.

## Why You Need a Machine Washable Rug in Your Life

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's talk about why these rugs are so revolutionary.

### 1. Unbeatable Convenience and Peace of Mind
Imagine this: instead of frantically blotting a stain and worrying about it setting forever, you just roll up the rug, toss it in the washer, and walk away. That's the level of ease we're talking about. It removes the anxiety of accidents, allowing you to actually *live* in your home without fear.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

### 2. The Perfect Solution for Homes with Pets and Kids
If you have a four-legged friend or a tiny human, you know that messes are a daily occurrence.
*   **For Pets:** Pet hair, dander, and the occasional ""accident"" are no match for a washable rug. A quick wash eliminates odors and allergens, keeping your home fresh and clean.
*   **For Kids:** From snack spills to art projects gone awry, a washable rug is a parent's secret weapon. It protects your floors and your sanity, all without the cost of professional cleaning.

### 3. Budget-Friendly Style
The ""affordable"" part is just as important as the ""washable"" part. Traditional rugs can be a huge investment, and professional cleaning costs add up quickly. Affordable, washable options mean you can:
*   **Refresh your space for less.**
*   **Swap out rugs seasonally** without breaking the bank.
*   **Replace a rug** that's truly damaged without financial panic.

## What to Look for When Buying an Affordable Washable Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

Not all washable rugs are created equal. Here’s a checklist of what to consider before you click ""buy.""

### ### Material Matters

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

The fabric determines how the rug feels, how well it cleans, and how long it lasts.

*   **Cotton:** Incredibly soft and often the most affordable. However, it can be prone to shrinking, so air-drying is highly recommended.
*   **Polyester & Other Synthetics:** This is often the *best choice* for a truly durable, stain-resistant, and low-maintenance rug. These materials dry quickly and hold their color wash after wash.
*   **Chenille:** Known for its plush, velvety feel. Many chenille rugs are machine washable and offer a great balance of comfort and practicality.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

> **Pro Tip:** Look for rugs labeled as ""stain-resistant"" or ""water-resistant,"" especially if you're placing it in a high-traffic area like a kitchen or entryway.

### ### Construction is Key

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

How the rug is made is just as important as what it's made of.

*   **Low-Pile is King:** A low-pile (flat or short weave) rug is your best bet for machine washing. It's less likely to get tangled or damaged in your machine's agitator and, crucially, it **dries much faster** than a high-pile or shag rug.
*   **Check the Backing:** Many **affordable machine washable rugs** have a soft, flexible backing that holds up well in the wash. Be wary of rugs with thick, rubbery or latex backings, as these can crack or peel in a high-heat dryer. A better option is a rug with a simple cloth backing that you can pair with a separate, removable non-slip pad.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

### ### Don't Forget Sizing and Care Labels!

*   **Measure Your Machine:** Before you fall in love with an 8x10 rug, make sure it will actually fit in your washing machine. Most standard home washers can handle up to a 5x8 rug comfortably. For larger rugs, you might need a commercial-sized machine at a laundromat.
*   **Read the Instructions (Seriously!):** The manufacturer’s label is your bible. It will tell you:
    *   Recommended water temperature (cold is usually safest).
    *   Type of wash cycle (gentle/delicate).
    *   Whether it can be tumble-dried or must be air-dried.

## Creative Ways to Use Your Washable Rugs

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

Once you have your perfect rug, where does it go? *Everywhere!*

*   **Kitchen:** Put one in front of the sink to catch spills and save your back.
*   **Bathroom:** A washable rug is a more hygienic alternative to a traditional bath mat.
*   **Entryway or Mudroom:** The ultimate line of defense against dirt and debris from outside.
*   **Kids' Room or Playroom:** A soft, clean surface for playtime that's easy to sanitize.
*   **Under the Dining Room Table:** Catch those inevitable food spills before they hit your hardwood floors.

## Quick Guide: Washing Your Rug Like a Pro

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=affordable%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

To keep your rug looking its best, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Shake It Out:** Before washing, take the rug outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt and debris.
2.  **Spot Treat Stains:** Use a gentle stain remover on any obvious spots before putting it in the machine.
3.  **Wash with Care:** Use a **gentle cycle with cold water** and a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach.
4.  **Air Dry If Possible:** The best way to maintain your rug’s shape and integrity is to hang it to dry or lay it flat. If you must use a dryer, use the lowest heat setting (no heat or air fluff is ideal).
5.  **Rotate Regularly:** To ensure even wear, rotate your rug every few months.

CommSec?","I’m a mum of two and currently on maternity leave as I’m only two months post partum. I have a good job and so does my partner although with my reduced income I feel things are a bit tight. We bought a house with 550k owing (AUD). We have an amount saved for emergencies, and live with a ‘set and forget’ approach to finances.

I’m 35 and I have everything I need. I buy my kids books from the opshop which our 2 year old loves to read. I have two nieces who give us hand me downs, and my obsession with coffee is minimal, but there. 

Aside from gym memberships and buying books for myself I’ll never read (probably have ADHD), I have pocket money that’s adding up. As I mentioned we have a ‘set and forget’ approach to finances and a lot of the time I find myself using my own pocket money for the basics for the kids. 

I can’t justify using money on makeup or getting my nails done. Occasionally I think I should get Botox but I have huge mum guilt that, that money could be put towards something more important to me. I enjoy looking good and get gratification from investing in my appearance but I also feel selfish in doing so. 

I cut my own hair if my sister in law hairdresser is too busy. I’m a minimalist at heart but also have grown up as an adult with the ‘scarcity’ mindset. I would rather invest my money in things to help build up my kids. 

So I’m wondering, even if it’s just 20 bucks a week from my personal funds (190 a fortnight),  what should I be doing and investing in, that allows a ‘set and forget’ kind of approach? We have 20 dollars per fortnight going into our children’s savings each but I want to do something more with my personal money. Otherwise I feel like it’s going to waste. I know investing in myself will ultimately trickle down to investing in my children, like going to the gym etc but I don’t think that’s feasible just yet, and is not something I see myself able to commit to consistently at this stage.

I have heard there is an EFT kind of approach I could use. Has anyone used a commsec account? I’m so confused when it comes to investing and I am really paralysed by too many options and lack of understanding. My background is in medical

1onwkeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ldssexuality/comments/1onwkeh/should_i_compromise_abstinence_to_marry_a_nonlds/,Should I Compromise Abstinence to Marry a Non-LDS man?,"Ok... to begin my long story (TIA if you read the whole thing!) I am a 38 yr old female, that spent 15 years in an emotionally abusive marriage to an LDS man, which ended a year ago. I didn't get to have any kids in that previous marriage thank goodness. My current boyfriend (42) and I have been dating for six months. He has been an incredible support as I continue to heal from that trauma, but I also recognize there are important differences in faith (he's not affiliated to any church, yet he has his own spiritual beliefs) and lifestyle (he smokes and drinks socially, and drinks lots of coffee). He also doesn't have kids yet and we have talked about it and he's on board with having kids at a later stage of his life, although not past 45... so there's a bit of a ""rush"" there.

I’ve spent a lot of time in prayer, therapy, and reflection to understand what “alignment” really means and how to balance this love while still honoring my covenants and core values—which, to his credit, he has respected as much as he can. I have a strong testimony and deeply value temple covenants, prayer, and personal revelation.

We’re getting serious with the intention of marriage but as we have an incredible mutual attraction, and to be honest in my previous marriage I was severely neglected in all aspects of my life especially sexually, things got intense between us and I consciously made the decision to have sex with him a few times. 

I really see myself with him as my husband, and he's incredibly serious about me. However, ever since we had sex (a month ago) I changed my mind about having sex, since I didn't feel like I was living my life with integrity based on my beliefs and of course I haven't gone to the Temple ever since. I miss that deeply and I also couldn't feel the Spirit as strong as before. However, I really don't regret that decision (of having sex) and don't really feel bad about it, but I have repented from it from the stand point that I broke a promise I had made with God. My bf supports this decision and is understanding even though I do see that it is affecting him. 

Here's the thing... his non-negotiable is to live together before marriage. I told him I'd be willing to compromise that once we get engaged. We share a lot of love, honesty, and emotional maturity. I value that emotional intelligence even more deeply because of my horrible past. I feel safe with him and we both have grown so much together in this relationship already.

After much prayer, I still feel peace about the possibility of marrying this man. However, if I do compromise living together before marriage once we're engaged, it's obvious we'll have sex. I am still not sure how I feel about it. A part of me wants to be like, ""I can live with you and have other forms of intimacy, but intercourse is off limits"", and another part of me is like ""well... we're gonna get married soon, so... I just won't be able to go to the Temple for that little while...""

For those who have navigated or witnessed mixed-faith relationships and sexuality prior to marriage in these relationships, how did you discern whether compassion towards ourselves and understanding of the gospel could truly bridge the differences?

How do you balance honoring your covenant path while also honoring the goodness, growth, and happiness you can have with a future spouse that is outside of it? I am torn regarding what to decide... but I am really happy with this man and I can't give him up! I actually had broken up with him 3 months after we had started dating because I thought I just couldn't live a mixed-faith life with my future husband... but I just couldn't give up the happiness I found and this beautiful relationship and we have been figuring things out as we go. He's also never been with a religious person before, so there's a lot of compromising we both have been doing while still choosing each other.

I strongly believe that God loves all his children, and that at the end of all this mortal life, everything will work out. I do desire a Temple marriage... but I just want to be happy and have a family :(

I’m not looking for simple answers or criticism — just sincere experiences, scriptural insights, or guidance that have brought comfort and assurance in similar situations.

Okay, confession time... I was totally skeptical when I first heard about the *Fit To Be Pregnant Plan*. I figured it was just another “miracle” program with a shiny website and a promise to “transform your energy and glow.” 🙄 But after **30 days**, I’ve got to admit — my results blew me away (and my energy levels? Let’s just say my coffee addiction took a back seat).  

Here’s what surprised me most:  

- 🍼 **Energy levels tripled — literally.** Before starting, I was dragging my feet by noon. Now? I’m up early, focused, and actually excited to move my body again.   
- 🧘 **Mood = lifted.** My brain fog cleared, my stress went down, and my motivation shot through the roof.  
- 🥗 **The food plan is realistic.** No overpriced supplements, no “you must eat algae powder at dawn.” Just smart, clean meals designed for sustainable energy.  
- 💻 **Digital convenience.** The real cherry on top: the program is entirely digital — meaning I could dive right in from my phone, no printing, no fuss.  

👉 I grabbed my copy here: [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b) — and let me tell you, worth **every** penny.  

By week three, even my partner noticed how upbeat and “lighter” I felt. And here’s the kicker — I realized how much of my daily fatigue wasn’t from exhaustion but from disorganized nutrition + inconsistent habits. This plan quietly rewired that.  

### My Favorite Takeaways:  
- Bulletproof morning routine = no burnout by 2 PM.  
- Understanding macro balance meant I finally ate to *fuel* myself (not punish myself).  
- Gentle movement > aggressive workouts. Who knew walking + stretch-based routines actually energize, instead of deplete?  

If you’ve ever struggled with sluggish mornings, brain fog by lunchtime, or energy crashes before dinner, this program might just shock you in the best way possible.  

It’s not a fad. It’s a reset — rooted in sustainable, evidence-based habits.  

I’d genuinely challenge anyone curious to try it for 30 days and see what happens. (Here’s the plan again for the curious 👇)

**LONG POST ALERT!**   
  
Yesterday, I posted a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjH1qy54Mmg) of the opening night event of the photo exhibition dreamt up by my friend Jamie Mattiazzo, and put together with the help of many people.  
  
When Jamie had the idea, he asked me if I wanted a room to put my work in.  I was honoured to given this opportunity and I knew that I had to make it good - so my creative wheels started turning and once the ideas started rolling in, it didn't stop!  
  
Before we get to my part in the show, here'e a refresher:  
  
\*\*\*  
  
On Saturday, November 1, 2025, the NOTL Contemporary Gallery at Ironwood Cider House hosted ENTROPY – URBEXHIBITION, a one-night-only photography event celebrating the art of urban exploration and the beauty found in decay.  
  
The exhibition transformed the Niagara-on-the-Lake gallery into a visual adventure through forgotten spaces, featuring powerful imagery from some of the most talented urban exploration photographers. Each artist revealed quiet, compelling stories hidden within abandoned places and structures across North America and beyond.  
  
The evening featured photography by u/Brentsoutdoors, u/Dauntless_obscura_, u/Efp_urbex, u/FrankXPhoto, u/Freaktography, u/GLMTphotos, u/International_Adam, u/amidtheabandoned, u/Rantropolis, u/S0S1NC3R3, and u/TrueNorthUrbex.  
  
Guests also enjoyed live DJ sets by DJ Marinko and s1nc3r3, creating an immersive atmosphere that complemented the visuals on display.  
  
Presented by The NOTL Contemporary, ENTROPY – URBEXHIBITION brought together photographers, artists, and urban exploration enthusiasts for an unforgettable evening celebrating creativity, decay, and discovery.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It was several weeks in the making, planning, selecting artists, collecting their work – my friend s0s1nc3r3 handled the brunt of that element while I was almost entirely focussed on my part of the exhibit.  
  
For my contribution, I wanted to do something entirely different, my idea was to give the visitors a sense of what it is like in an abandoned house and to experience the things that we see and that we find.  
  
First, I had to cover the walls - flip through the photos for descriptions of all of the images I selected and why.  
  
For the right side wall, I settled on three large industrial photos  at 24""x16"" from locations in Portugal, British Columbia and New York State.  
  
For the back wall, I decided to do 5 exteriors, one large eye catching photo in the middle at 24""x36"", surrounded by 4 photos at 18""x12"" from Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta.  
  
On the right wall, I wanted to do strictly verticals and show a representation of various types of locations all together.  I selected a jail, a power plant, a psychiatric institution, abandoned houses, a funeral home and a hotel.  
  
For the main draw and my Big Idea, I was very lucky to have made contact with the nephew of a woman who passed away several years ago, he is now the executor of her estate. The woman’s house has been abandoned for several years and in very rough shape.   
  
I asked the man if I could enter the house, capture photos of items in the house, and then bring those items into an exhibition to accompany the photos that I took. I would then return all of the items to the house at the conclusion of the show.  
  
The result was a tangible and immersive viewing experience where the visitors could see and smell the items that are actually in the photos. I left them dirty and dusty, almost exactly as they were when inside the house.  
  
He allowed me to use anything I wanted from inside the house, so I borrowed tables, a rocking chair, an old blanket and several items that I found scattered around the house. I even used the actual working lamps in the house to illuminate the photos and the items.  
  
In addition to the items that I found and photographed, I also displayed several different items that I found scattered around the house to display in the room.    
  
I wanted the viewers to see the kinds of things that we find in abandoned houses and to see them with their own eyes.  I used tables from inside the house, end tables, a hutch, a beside table and a coffee table to display the work and the relics from inside the house.  
  
Lastly, another idea that I came up with and wanted to try was for those with a sharp eye.  
  
I selected three of my photos from three separate locations that contained a door and a hallway or something in the background.  With these photos, I created a three-dimensional effect by cutting and layering the photos and lining them up inside shadow boxes.  
  
The idea worked and those who noticed it, loved it!  
  
OK, this post is already too long, I have many more photos and more write up on my website, at this blog post all about the event.  
  
So, flip through these photos where I provide some commentary on why I used certain photos, and you can see the items in the house, in my final photos and in the exhibition.

It worked. Found his LinkedIn, his personal blog from 2008 about model trains, and a Twitter account where he mostly posts pics of his cat, Mittens. I now know Mittens is ""a fluffy menace"" and requires organic salmon treats.

1onw9ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChinaMedicalSupport/comments/1onw9ck/a_beijing_oncologists_guide_to_9_hidden_cancer/,"A Beijing Oncologist's Guide to 9 ""Hidden"" Cancer Risks We Often Ignore (e.g., Kitchen Fumes, Hot Drinks, Cured Meats)","Hey Reddit,

We all see a lot of health ""hacks"" and clickbait online, and it's hard to know what's real. I came across a really practical, no-nonsense guide from a practicing oncologist in China, and some of his points were genuinely surprising. I thought it was valuable enough to translate and share.

The advice comes from Dr. Wang Shuo, a physician in the Department of Oncology at Beijing Shijitan Hospital. He broke down 9 key lifestyle risks, and they aren't all the ones you'd expect.

[A Doctor's Guide to Cancer Prevention: 9 Lifestyle Risks to Avoid | MedBridgeNZ Medical Tourism China](https://preview.redd.it/mx6dha20n5zf1.jpg?width=704&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85f9a47bbe1c1679735db3d81cb505ded8e4460d)

We all know ""don't smoke,"" but he went deeper. Here are a few of the ones that stood out to me:

**1. ""Smoke""  - But Not Just Cigarettes...**

This was the most interesting one. He specifically called out **kitchen fumes.** When we heat cooking oil to high temperatures (like for deep-frying or even some stir-frying), it releases polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are potent carcinogens. His advice: **Always use your range hood**, and keep it running for a few minutes *after* you've finished cooking to clear the air.

**2. ""Scalding"" - Your ""Piping Hot"" Coffee/Tea**

I'm guilty of this. Dr. Wang pointed out that consuming foods and drinks *consistently* above 65°C (149°F) can cause thermal injury to the lining of your esophagus. It's not the one-time burn, but the *long-term cycle* of damage and repair that can dramatically increase the risk of esophageal cancer. He says to let that hot soup or tea cool down to just ""warm.""

**3. ""Mold"" - The ""Hidden Toxin""**

This isn't just about ""cutting off the moldy part"" of bread. He specifically mentioned **aflatoxins**, a substance produced by mold on foods like corn and peanuts, as one of the most potent liver carcinogens known. His advice is non-negotiable: If it's moldy, it's garbage. You can't ""gamble"" with it.

**4. ""Cured"" - The Preservative Problem**

This refers to things like bacon, ham, sausages, and other salted/cured meats. While delicious, they are often high in nitrites. In our stomachs, these can convert to nitrosamines, which are powerful carcinogens linked to stomach cancer. His advice was to treat these as an occasional-only food, not a daily staple.

**Why I'm sharing this:**

My work involves bridging the gap between international patients and the medical world in China (I run a **medical concierge service** called MedBridgeNZ). Because of this, I follow a lot of health and wellness insights from their top medical experts. This guide was so straightforward and practical that I wrote up a full English summary of all 9 points.

His other points cover **Sugar**, **Alcohol**, **Sun Exposure**, **Charred/Grilled Foods**, and the link between **Viruses** (like HBV/HPV) and cancer.

If you're interested in reading the full, detailed guide, you can find it on our blog:

1onw8dm,https://i.redd.it/5n0x9m6tm5zf1.jpeg,(Almost) 26 days smoke free*,"*i had one slip but more on that in a second 

Feeling pretty proud of myself! I am noticing more and more how much mental space actively smoking takes up: Always worrying about your next smoke break, how many ciggies left in the pack, if you can take a sneaky smoke break at work, if you smell, if that weird bump in your mouth is cancerous, adding time to leaving or arriving somewhere to make sure you can have a cig. 

Today, it was almost 1pm before I realized I didn’t think about smoking or use my nicotine spray. I’m also down to using the spray only once or twice a day.

Last week I smoked 1 cigarette after not smoking for 3 weeks. I’ve been getting my shit absolutely rocked by life this month and just *needed* it. So I did and it… sucked. I was hoping for that instant relief feeling but it didn’t happen, halfway through it felt like a chore. After all my problems were still there but now I just had a headache and smelled bad.  I was worried I was going to crave them after slipping but realizing how shitty I felt after was actually kind of helpful. It took away that “what if” feeling that I kept having. “What if I just had one right now, would I feel better? What if I smoke one with my morning coffee? It’ll be great”. Now I know the answer and it wasn’t what I wanted. 

One thing I keep telling myself is that ciggies weren’t actually helping me relax or de-stress, they’re not magic wands to make my problems go away. The only thing I can control right now is my ability to keep not smoking and I’m finding that super empowering. 

Good luck everyone! Be gentle with yourselves. ",2,1762224708.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

Simply mesmerizing!  This fragrance is so good for this early Fall period. Wore today while running errands and to the nail salon for my manicure. Compliment given at the coffee shop I worked from this morning and one from a stranger at the nail salon.

Apparently it’s a clone of or inspired by Montale’s Arabian Tonka. It does have a sweet tonka/vanilla bean appeal, but not overwhelming. I’ve even read where some liken it to a masculine version of BR540. I don’t get that comparison.

It’s not a complex scent. Fresh in the opening, dries to the Vanilla/Tonka scent and develops powdery over time. Not complex, but also not linear. Just a great fragrance with a great value.

- Down for drinks, a weekend getaway, or a movie marathon.

I did 2x4 kiln dried wood with 4 inch lag bolts into each stud for the butcher block and for the shelf I did 1/2 inch Shepard brackets directly into stud then patched. Both are stained and poly coated. I Drilled 12 inch holes to slip the brackets into the shelf so it has the floating look.

For cable management I hid everything on far right side and routed everything for easy access(this took the longest lol). I also had an electrician install a new outlet and fed it from an existing outlet to hide the power strip cord also.

I finally wrapped up everything with Flexispot c7 morpher chair which I have no words for. Extremely amazing sturdy and my back pain literally has disappeared. I was on an old chair for years which broke down on me so definitely worth the investment (extremely expensive) but worth it.

He tried to kiss me and then apologised for it because I wasn’t ready. i told him later that day, in messages that we’re not going to gym together as we planned to because I didn’t feel good after our date. Idk I just knew something wasn’t right. The next day we met at gym, the communication was quite warm but uncomfortable (just hi and uncomfortable smiles) and he didn’t even say bye. Yet we met on Wednesday for coffee, and the rest of the week was weird. We were really touchy, even though I did not mind I came home every time and I felt used. I slowly got cold towards him, then he told me he really likes me in texts. He said he never felt anything like this to a girl (he said he was shaking when we met and it never happened before, mind you I’m 18 he’s 23). I thought that’s weird and sounds cliche, like a typical manipulation tactic. He said he’s ready to wait without knowing if I will ever like him. I said it’s okay and that I’m not comfortable with how touchy we are. I also told him I thought his intentions were purely s\*xual and he said he couldn't even think of it. The next time we saw each other he was just as touchy, I noticed it.. but idk, I ate that up because I liked it. I know I should’ve noticed this and see this huge red flag, I know. So the next week everything was really good. At that time I thought I didn’t like him that much (now I think I didn’t feel safe enough to accept it and didn’t wanna move forward). The day things changed. It was my first day of period, he was walking me home, and left half way leaving me at the park in the dark - I felt really lonely and made a big deal out of it for myself, but said nothing, he said he needed to go to work. yes I was dramatic bc of the cycle and was going home crying. I felt really bad physically, told him about it later that day on messages, he said you’re too dramatic. I cried (i;m sorry if anyone thinks I’m drama queen). The next 3 days I was really cold and we didn’t see didn’t meet, until on Thursday I said we better stop communicating( still haven't seen him from the day he left me at the park). Month later he unfollowed, but kept watching stories. And then this week, I noticed he blocked me on telegram - idk why because we were not chatting or communicating. It was a month after we stopped talking (2 weeks to be precise bc I texted him to say sorry for treating him so badly the past few days we talked)

He’s a foreigner in my country, older and more experienced than me, different mentality.

Guys just tell me whatever you think because I’m trying to process it, I've been trying to for a very long time and I need some outside perspective. I wanna get over it but I see him almost daily in the gym (I can’t change the gym & can’t change the time I go there). Someone tell me why would guy block me when we don’t even talk.

Recently, however, I've been wanting to upgrade, and I've been eyeing the Breville Barista Pro. I've read the posts here about the machine's built-in grinder and its pros and cons.

However, I wouldn't really classify myself as an espresso expert; I'm mainly drawn to the pro for its thermojet rapid heat-up, the convenience of having the grinder built in, and an overall quick, easy, and delicious espresso machine. And the more recent pros use Baratza grinders, which is an added perk.

I guess I'm wondering: as someone looking to upgrade while maintaining an efficient, delicious espresso process, is there another machine or setup I should absolutely consider? Or should I just go with the pro and hopefully have it for at least 8-10 years?

Suppose I truly find myself dissuaded with the grinder & becoming more of a focused espresso artist. In that case, I'd be ok down the line revisiting a separate grinder & machine, as a note. Thank you guys — I appreciate the insights!",1,1762224155.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1onw0hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1onw0hf/retaliated_against_at_work_for_reporting_sexual/,Retaliated against at work for reporting Sexual Harassment .. what do I do?,"I’ll try and keep this as detailed and as brief as possible…

For reference, I’m a 28 year old male, I work in construction. I’ve been with the company for 10 years. I started in the field (site crew) and eventually was brought into the office to do administrative work thinking the grass would be greener…it wasn’t. 

I was surrounded by people in their 50s and 60s that had been with the company for 20-30 years and were very set in their ways. I felt very isolated and unheard at meetings, lunch, protocol ideas, etc. 

Then, one day, they hired a younger female (23) to work on our marketing and project administration tasks. I was so excited to have another “young” person in the office. At a professional level, we worked well together and became “work buddies” getting a lot accomplished which kept upper managment happy…we shared some things about our lives (like she had a BF, and how I have a GF) but at the end of the work day, we went out separate ways and didn’t interact until the next day. So everything seemed fine and dandy until the incident occurred…

One afternoon, I was having a cup of coffee in the break room when a field supervisor came in the back door. He saw me and immediately ran up to me, getting in my face with a look of excitement and yelled (he actually yelled this) “HEY! I HEAR YOU’RE FUCKING (insert female coworker name) !! I HEARD YOU’RE FUCKING HER GOOD! YEAH! I HEARD THIS FROM THE GUYS IN THE FIELD!”

I was horrified. My mouth was agape. I just stared at him. Then he repeated himself as if I didn’t hear him. After standing there, looking at him for about 30 seconds, I informed him, “that is not true, she has a boyfriend, I have a girlfriend, we literally don’t talk outside of work.” To which he followed up with “that’s not what I heard! You’re fucking her!” Mind you this is a 55 year old man.

This REALLY bothered me. So, I talked to one of my co-workers who I trusted at the time, and they urged me to bring it up to the president of the company. So I did. In return the president scolded me for bringing it up and then said “now we have to get HR involved.” And he said it in a way like it was an inconvenience to him. HR got involved and did an investigation.

They didn’t terminate the employee. Instead, they left his “punishment” up to the president. It didn’t last long because the employee spread this around the field and tried to take down other co-workers with him. A week later, he quit.

Everything seemed okay for a few days or so, then I was approached and told I was “needed back in the field.” I asked for how long, thinking it was a short term thing they needed a hand with. I wasn’t given an immediate answer.  I was confused but the next day I received my “marching orders” to go to the field at job site X.  Thinking it would be refreshing to get away from the office for a bit, I approached the day positively. However that quickly turned sour.  The field crew  (and this is no exaggeration, the carpenters and tradesmen of the company looked at my side eyed, wouldn’t come near me, aka walked away when I approached / didn’t interact with me). They avoided me. 

In my old role in the field, I would go to the shop and get materials, or documents from the office to bring out to the job site if needed. Not anymore. I’ve more or less have been demoted back to the field indefinitely, I’m not “allowed” near the office, and my superior cleaned off my desk and put my things in a box. But they didn’t fire me. 

This is, in my opinion, work place retaliation. I’ve been looking for a new job since but haven’t had luck. This situation is starting to really get to me. It’s taxing on my mental health and my social / personal life. I’ve kept a timeline and notes from the incident to now documenting it all. HR won’t do anything (and I’m saying that because we all know HR protects the company not the employee)..

My question is, what do I do? I know I’m labeled as a whistleblower, but sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious thing. I mean, do I even waste my time, energy and breath and expose the company for workplace retaliation? Or, do I just bow out gracefully as I’ve been trying to do once a new job offer comes my way? The company probably won’t be around in the next 3-5 years anyways due to retirements, lack of work, and the owners not knowing what the hell they’re doing. So I’m trying to get off the sinking ship so to speak, but can’t find a life boat. And every day at work is a living hell. 

I appreciate you reading this and lending your advice. ",5,1762224097.0,workplace_bullying,7,1.0,False

I met him in the gym, he asked my ig when we were leaving - it happened we left at the same time that day. it was on Thursday, on Friday we saw each other in the gym and he walked me home, Sunday was a first actual date - he started to get touchy and I didn’t mind. He tried to kiss me and then apologised for it because I wasn’t ready. i told him later that day, in messages that we’re not going to gym together as we planned to because I didn’t feel good after our date. Idk I just knew something wasn’t right. The next day we met at gym, the communication was quite warm but uncomfortable (just hi and uncomfortable smiles) and he didn’t even say bye. Yet we met on Wednesday for coffee, and the rest of the week was weird. We were really touchy, even though I did not mind I came home every time and I felt used. I slowly got cold towards him, then he told me he really likes me in texts. He said he never felt anything like this to a girl (he said he was shaking when we met and it never happened before, mind you I’m 18 he’s 23). I thought that’s weird and sounds cliche, like a typical manipulation tactic. He said he’s ready to wait without knowing if I will ever like him. I said it’s okay and that I’m not comfortable with how touchy we are. I also told him I thought his intentions were purely s\*xual and he said he couldn't even think of it. The next time we saw each other he was just as touchy, I noticed it.. but idk, I ate that up because I liked it. I know I should’ve noticed this and see this huge red flag, I know. So the next week everything was really good. At that time I thought I didn’t like him that much (now I think I didn’t feel safe enough to accept it and didn’t wanna move forward). The day things changed. It was my first day of period, he was walking me home, and left half way leaving me at the park in the dark - I felt really lonely and made a big deal out of it for myself, but said nothing, he said he needed to go to work. yes I was dramatic bc of the cycle and was going home crying. I felt really bad physically, told him about it later that day on messages, he said you’re too dramatic. I cried (i;m sorry if anyone thinks I’m drama queen). The next 3 days I was really cold and we didn’t see didn’t meet, until on Thursday I said we better stop communicating( still haven't seen him from the day he left me at the park). Month later he unfollowed, but kept watching stories. And then this week, I noticed he blocked me on telegram - idk why because we were not chatting or communicating. It was a month after we stopped talking (2 weeks to be precise bc I texted him to say sorry for treating him so badly the past few days we talked)



He’s a foreigner in my country, older and more experienced than me, different mentality.

Guys just tell me whatever you think because I’m trying to process it, I've been trying to for a very long time and I need some outside perspective. I wanna get over it but I see him almost daily in the gym (I can’t change the gym & can’t change the time I go there). Someone tell me why would guy block me when we don’t even talk. I remember he used to avoid me in the gym and then few days after the I saw he blocked me, he came really close (to do exercise but still)",1,1762224037.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

### Pro Tips for the Perfect Stocking Stuffer Strategy

1.  **Think Daily Routine:** What do they use every single day? A better version of that (like a nice pen or hand cream) is always a winner.
2.  **Embrace Consumables:** Gourmet coffee, fancy snacks, and bath bombs get used up and don't create clutter.
3.  **Personalize It:** An engraved initial or a gift related to an inside joke shows you put in extra thought.
4.  **Don't Forget Practicality:** A phone charger or a portable tool isn't glamorous, but it's incredibly useful and appreciated.
5.  **Group Small Items:** A few small, themed items (like ""Movie Night Kit"" with popcorn, candy, and fuzzy socks) feel like a bigger, more cohesive gift.

## Anatomy of a Commercial Popcorn Machine: Key Features to Understand

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

Not all popcorn poppers are created equal. Understanding these key components will help you make an informed decision.

### ### Kettle Size: The Heart of the Machine

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

This is the most important specification you'll see. Measured in ounces, the kettle size determines how much popcorn you can produce in one batch. It's not about how much it holds, but how many *raw* kernels it can pop at once.

*   **4 oz Kettle:** Perfect for low-traffic locations like a small office breakroom or a home theater. Produces about 4 quarts per batch.
*   **6 oz Kettle:** A great small-business option. Ideal for coffee shops, bars, or smaller concession stands. Produces about 6 quarts per batch.
*   **8 oz Kettle:** The workhorse of the industry. This is a popular choice for movie theaters, convenience stores, and mid-sized venues. Produces about 8 quarts per batch.
*   **12 oz Kettle and up:** Built for high-volume operations like stadiums, large amusement parks, and major event venues. These can produce over 12 quarts per batch and are designed to run continuously.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

**Pro-Tip:** Always choose a kettle size one step larger than you think you need. It's better to have extra capacity than a line of impatient customers waiting for the next batch.

### ### Popper Style: Countertop vs. Cart

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

How you serve the popcorn matters.

*   **Countertop Models:** These are designed to sit on a sturdy surface. They are perfect for permanent installations in a kitchen, behind a bar, or at a concession counter.
*   **Popcorn Carts:** These machines feature a classic, old-fashioned design on a cart with wheels. They are the ultimate mobile solution, perfect for catering events, farmers' markets, and outdoor festivals. They create a fantastic visual attraction.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

### ### Heating Method: Gas vs. Electric

*   **Electric Popcorn Machines:** The most common type. They simply plug into a standard outlet. They are easy to use, clean, and maintain, making them ideal for most indoor locations.
*   **Gas Popcorn Machines:** These run on propane or natural gas. They heat up faster and are often more powerful, making them a favorite for outdoor vendors or locations without reliable electricity. They require more ventilation and safety precautions.

## How to Choose the Right Machine for Your Business

Ready to shop? Ask yourself these four questions:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

1.  **What's my expected volume?** Refer back to the kettle size guide. Be honest about how much you'll sell, especially during peak hours.
2.  **Where will I be using it?** This dictates whether you need a mobile **popcorn cart** or a stationary **countertop popcorn machine**. For indoor use, electric is usually best. For outdoor or mobile use, a gas-powered cart might be the answer.
3.  **What's my budget?** A small **commercial popcorn machine** can start around a few hundred dollars, while large, feature-rich models can run into the thousands. Determine what you can afford, but remember that this is an investment that should pay for itself quickly.
4.  **What are the essential features?** Look for quality materials like stainless steel and tempered glass. A built-in ""warming deck"" is crucial to keep popcorn fresh and crispy. An ""old-maid drawer"" is a handy feature that collects unpopped kernels for easy disposal.

## Beyond the Machine: Supplies and Maintenance

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

Your popper is just the start. To create that perfect movie-theater taste, you'll need the right supplies.

*   **Mushroom-Style Popcorn Kernels:** These pop into large, round balls perfect for holding coatings and looking full in a bag.
*   **Coconut Oil:** This is the secret ingredient for that authentic movie theater flavor and aroma.

I pay my 400 bucks. Guy says ""it'll ship in 3, maybe 4 days. From the in store order it will ship faster."" Mind you, the website says shipping options are ""fast, faster, fastest"".... 2 day shipping was 25 dollars but it wasn't offered to me in store to buy that. 

October by that next Wednesday I email customer service cause I hadn't even got an order confirmed email etc. Just the receipt. No answer. Friday, 7 whole days later, I call in. ""Just wanted to see if there's any update..."" girl on the phone says 

""OH it looks like it shipped! Did you not get the tracking email?""

""Nope. Didn't get any email."" 

""OH. Well. It shipped.... did you want the tracking number??"" 

Yes.... yes I would. 

Items from Filson, a Seattle company I guess ship from Mississippi now? It's full on snail mail... usps economy mail. It says estimated arrival is today, the 3rd. I wake up in the morning, drinking my coffee and check shipping. 6am today, left the aurora Colorado post office. A few hours later, got updated to show Wednesday 9pm is the arrival. 

It's honestly just lame lol. That will mark almost 2 weeks for a delivery. That's unacceptable to me. This isn't some small time mom and pop shop, this is the premier Filson outfitter. Their customer service sucked, shipping times suck, I have half a mind just to return it.

I feel that we are in a tough financial time as a country, so everything is continuously going up in price. I don’t know if that’s the company fault either, because they’re trying to stay afloat too. But $5 is just crazy… am I wrong? Should I just never go back again and stay silent? What if everyone started reviewing overpriced companies worse than this?

Other than this, what about reviews about companies that ridiculously underpay their workers? I’m talking about paralegals making minimum wage at the firm and working two jobs. Don’t future clients have the right to know a company undervalues their workers? Personally, if I found out a company was underpaying their workers, I would start comparing other options.

What if a CEO has done a questionable act, and I am reviewing one of their companies or local branches? Is it relevant in a review? Is it accountability?

Don’t get me started on $7 coffee.

Is this an effective way to give power back to consumers? Can google intervene and take these reviews down? Is it useless and overstepping, and should we let companies just do what they want on our end?

We got close quite quickly, we have the same sense of humour, agree on a lot of the same things and there just generally is a connection between us I can not explain or put my finger on. Everyone who knows us both can not understand what I see in him but there is something I see that no one else does.

Comments on how close we were have been made, how much we got on and even made comments to me about how much he clearly liked me. I always passed this off as others reading into something that wasn’t there, we were friends and we just got on really well. We never even spoke to each other outside of work.

Fast forward a year or so and something seemed to shift between us. I couldn’t explain what started it or how it came to be as it happened so naturally. We started flirting more, we spoke out of work and people started picking up on feelings we didn’t think we were making obvious. I was told when I walk in the office they noticed his eyes immediately fell on me, was told when I am not there all he does is speak about me. He even knew the date we first started working together so knew how long ago we’d met. I was even told by those who mutually know his still girlfriend (29F) who I think he has been with for 8yrs that she had asked who I was so it was clear he had spoken about me at home in whatever capacity. I put all this down to work place gossip and people having nothing better to do then entertain themselves with a soap opera of other people’s lives. I was told the smile on my face when I saw him said it all, that anything he asked me for wasn’t a case of I’ll do it when I have time it was immediate I did anything he asked even as simple as dropping everything to make him a drink (at this point I know what coffee he drinks/ how many sugars/ even how many times a day).

Things progressed and we sent messages we should not have sent being in relationships to each other and it went on for months. Nothing physical happened but he told me he loved me and if I left my partner he would leave his so we could be together. I declined the offer. He has moved to another branch of the company now so we don’t see each other and my feelings began to fade I put it down to lust for someone I saw all the time and found attractive.

We went to a company event last week and it was the first time we had seen each other in a long time and all the feelings I thought had faded came back. He looked good, we gravitated to each other like we had before and again it feels so natural to do so. He made it clear he still has some feelings towards me, that if he was not in a relationship with his girlfriend I would be who he wanted.

Now I can not stop over thinking it, I am sure he is aware of how I feel as much as I try to down play it. I try to tell myself he is playing his feelings off to as he has said he values me as a friend but I don’t act how I do with my other male friends as I do with him and I doubt he acts with his female friends how he does with me.

We are both in relationships and I do love my partner (32M) we have been together 4yrs. We have a nice life together, he truly loves me and I know he does people would only dream of having someone love me the way my partner loves me but I still think about this other guy.

TLDR - I (30F) have feelings for someone else (33M) other than my partner (32M) lol. It was made clear the feelings were reciprocated at one stage but not anymore. I still feel the same and I am torn.

Have I fallen for someone who clearly has no interest in me or should I end my relationship and make my feelings for him (33M) clear and see if he does feel the same way?",1,1762223427.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1onvqay,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onvqay/theres_only_one_rule_to_remember_if_you_see_the/,There’s only one rule to remember if you see the Buttonhook Men: don’t tell a soul they exist.,"They’ll disappear you.

And for breaking this rule, I’ll soon find out where their victims go. I won’t be able to outrun them.

After all, they’re not really ‘men’ at all.

A buttonhook is a handheld aid with a curved hook at one end and a handle at the other; it fastens and unfastens unyielding buttons. That’s all. It’s not an exciting invention. Not even a particularly well-known one. Certainly not sinister in the slightest.

But, you know, even the most mundane of tools can do far-from-mundane things in wilful hands.

For context, I learnt about the immigration officers of Ellis Island in history class. Men who used buttonhooks to intrusively inspect prospective American citizens for trachoma; a contagious eye disease that resulted in blindness when left untreated. Eyelids were peeled back like fruit skin. A ghastly procedure.

These immigration officers became known as the buttonhook men, and they were feared by those being processed on the island. That’s a horror story in itself, but not the one I’m here to tell.

No, this is the story of the unearthly creatures my friends and I came to call the Buttonhook Men, influenced by our recent history lesson. These creatures have been disappearing people in my hometown, which I’ll call Noplace, for 29 years.

Bear in mind that the original buttonhook men of Ellis Island were just that: men. And men die. It’s *ideas* that live. Stories. Monsters. Only, these aren’t the fictional kind. They’re real, no matter how much you might want them not to be; and if you think they won’t come for you, God save your soul.

Because this is bigger than my hometown. None of us will be safe for long.

First, they come for someone else.

Next, they come for *you*.

Noplace is a fourth-rate crap-heap and always has been, but our economy really nose-dived in the nineties. Of course, my friends and I were too young to understand why. We didn’t know or care about austerity. About powerful men who bled the working class, the middle class, and even some of the upper class.

It’s a confusing thing, the way the world works. That’s why most of us simply choose not to study the mechanisms. We only really give a hoot when life becomes expensive. Hard. And isn’t it the darnedest thing that those responsible always make sure we point our fingers at each other?

That was what broke Noplace in 1998, when I was eleven years old.

And by the time the Buttonhook Men arrived, it was already too late.

Tom, Pari, Julianne, and I called ourselves the Fun Four back then. We looked out for one another. Pari, mostly. She was born in Noplace, but her mother, Samira, moved here from India in the late eighties; pregnant, recently widowed, and in catastrophic straits. She upheaved her life to survive. To ensure her soon-to-be-born girl would survive.

Pari had a good life, mostly. She caught a few racist remarks here and there, but the Fun Four looked out for her. The trouble started to brew in ‘95 with the unveiling of Noplace’s mega-mart. It quickly drove local shops out of business. And when the supermarket hired Samira, it was easy for Noplace citizens to blame her. The brown-skinned cashier.

Life became scary for them, but fear came for us all on December 20^(th) 1998.

That night, in Pari’s bedroom, the Fun Four watched films on a bulky box-television. It was a distraction sleepover. See, whilst we were upstairs, Pari’s mother was being interrogated by Constable Harrison in the kitchen. Noplace’s police constable was a nice-mannered man, but a weak one. Despite his pleasantries and platitudes, he had no backbone.

Case in point: Harrison was following up on a baseless accusation made by Mrs Bradshaw, whose husband’s bakery went under in ‘97. An accusation that Samira had used falsified information when applying for British citizenship nearly twelve years earlier.

That was a lie.

“What film next?” I asked.

Pari shrugged. “I don’t care, Joshua. Anything. Just…” The tears made their entrance. “They’re gonna make us move to India.”

Tom frowned. “But you’re not even *from* India.”

“Doesn’t matter. Mrs Bradshaw called us ‘foreign muck’, and everybody agrees.”

“Well, *I* don’t,” Julianne said. “And my brother told me Mrs Bradshaw got a Brazilian Butt Lift a few years earlier. Should we ask the policeman to send that ‘foreign muck’ back too?”

Tom and I chuckled, and Pari came close.

An hour later, once the constable had finished his interrogation and left, Samira came up to Pari’s room.

“Bedtime now,” she said, then she nodded at Tom and me. “You two will go in the spare room. Julianne, you’ll sleep in here with Pari.”

Tom got to his feet. “Yes, ma’am.”

“I’m special,” Julianne whispered to me, and I nudged her in the ribs.

Pari began, “Mum, what did—”

“Not now, beti,” her mother said, before nodding more sternly at me. “*Bedtime*, Joshua. It’s nine o’clock.”

“Sorry,” I said, getting to my own feet and joining Tom at the door; I turned back before shutting it, and smiled softly at Pari. “It’ll be okay, Paz.”

She said nothing. Instead, my friend sniffled, burrowed beneath her duvet, and flicked off the bedside lamp. Julianne remained on the carpet in that dimly moonlit room, and she spoke to me with a shrug; *I don’t know what to do to make all of this better*, it said. I returned with a nod because I didn’t know either.

A still-sobbing Samira closed her daughter’s door, then led Tom and I across the upstairs landing. As she opened the door to the spare room, I thought of something warm to say. Something that might dry her eyes. But before I had a chance, Pari’s mother let out a faint croak of horror and shot her arms sideways.

She was bracing Tom and me from something ahead.

Something in the blackness of her bedroom doorway at the end of the corridor.

It was black unlike any other black. I don’t know how else to put it, just as I don’t know whether I turned cold as the result of Samira’s sudden movement or as the result of being eyed by that doorway’s colourless cavity.

Whatever the case, I feared it more than anything else in the world.

“What’s wrong, ma’am?” was Tom’s timid question.

Samira stood still and answered with a shake of her head, but she did not twist to face us. I didn’t like that. And the longer we stood there, staring into that dark doorframe, the more assured I became that—

*Something is staring back at us*.

“Ma’am,” Tom pressed, tugging on Samira’s sleeve to get a response. “What’s in—”

“There’s nothing in the doorway, Thomas,” she said before he finished the question.

Then, as Samira started to shepherd us into the spare room, I glimpsed something.

A silver curl glinting from the black of the doorway.

I thought I’d imagined it, but as Pari’s mother closed the door on Tom and me, I heard him whisper—

“Buttonhook…”

I knew exactly what Tom was referencing. Ellis Island. The buttonhook men. But he had to be wrong, I decided. *It was a trick of the light*.

“It was a buttonhook man,” Tom said. “From the photos Mr Langton showed us.”

I shook my head. “No. Shut up. It wasn’t anything. It was—”

“Go to bed, boys,” Samira said from the other side of the door, “*and do not leave this room*.”

There followed creaks of floorboards as Pari’s mother crept along the hallway towards her bedroom. And then nothing. Not the sound of Samira shutting her bedroom door. Just nothing. No noise at all.

“What’s going on?” Tom said.

“Don’t…” I warned fruitlessly, knowing my friend too well.

But he had already pushed down the handle and opened the bedroom door. Tom was the smartest of the Fun Four, but *stupidly* brave. He had no survival instincts. I begrudgingly chased him onto the upstairs landing, and we stopped under the glow of the orange light overhead. We eyeballed the black of Samira’s bedroom.

On the carpet before that threshold were her fluffy white slippers.

And red droplets.

“W… What is that…?” I whimpered, knowing full well that it was blood.

“Something’s happened to her…” Tom said. “We need to do something… *We need to tell someone!*”

The moment he uttered that final word, there sounded a dissonant clink from Samira’s room. Tom looked at me, ready to ‘do something’ and ‘tell someone’, and I merely whimpered with great dread as I looked over his shoulder at the doorway.

The dark from within was spreading without.

It gushed out of the doorframe and towards us. A black stream through a ravine of white walls.

*There’s nothing in the doorway*, Samira had promised. Well, I’d known that was a lie. Known Tom was right.

We hadn’t imagined the glint of silver.

As the darkness engulfed us, nearly entirely extinguishing the light above, Tom turned on his heel. The two of us faced the black of the doorway.

*Faced the figure emerging from it.*

It wasn’t a man, much as the silver tip of his appendage wasn’t a buttonhook, or a hand, or anything remotely of our world. But I needed a frame of reference to stop my terrified mind from unravelling entirely, so I accepted Tom’s name: this was a buttonhook man, like the ones from Ellis Island.

The thing was cloaked in shade which sloshed from its black portal and nearly drowned the lightbulb entirely. I was glad of that. What I *could* see was already too much. This bipedal thing, with limbs tapering off into keen silver tips, each bearing a slight curve, may have had a face. A mouth. Eyes. But maybe not. I tried not to look too closely. Tried only to drag Tom back into the bedroom.

He resisted, of course.

“Where is she?” my friend asked.

The Buttonhook Man answered by wrapping bladed limbs like a noose around Tom’s neck and hoisting the boy into the air.

“Don’t kill me!” he wailed.

The creature obliged.

It uncoiled one of its silvery extremities from Tom’s throat, then surgically jabbed at his eyes. My friend screeched louder as the Buttonhook Man blinded him. And I screeched, selfishly, as I presumed myself to be next.

When the creature finished plucking out Tom’s eyes, I prayed a silent prayer for it to be over. For the inhuman thing to slink back into the shadows. But the Buttonhook Man put its silver appendage to work again, this time driving a hook up Tom’s nostril and having a rootle; fishing deeply up into my friend’s head.

What horrified me most was that Tom’s moans of terror quickly devolved. Became moans of confusion. Moans of vegetative nothingness. And then the Buttonhook Man removed its pointed limb to reveal what must have been grey matter from Tom’s skull.

My once wise, though admittedly foolhardy, friend had been rendered a lobotomised husk.

He presumably shuffled past me, down the stairs, and out of the door. But the terrible truth is that I don’t remember. I was in shock. Near catatonic. I don’t remember what became of him. I don’t know where he went. I know only that he’s not been seen since that day in 1998 because I wasn’t registering anything. I was thinking only—

*RUN. I HAVE TO RUN.*

Which the Buttonhook Man proved to be true as it slashed a silver limb-end my way.

The thing lacerated my forearm, drawing a gash from my wrist up to my elbow and an agonised yelp from my core. The scar stays with me to this day. The feeling of that cold appendage icing not only the flesh and the bone below, but my very heart. It felt, for a moment, as if I had been changed not only physically but emotionally.

As if I had become a husk of a person, blind to empathy.

Blind to any human thought or feeling.

Pulling back from the lurching creature, I gunned for Pari’s room, tore open her door, and slammed it behind me. As pounding came from the other side, I turned to find myself in another moonlit space bearing an unfolding scene of horror.

Pari was lying in bed, screaming up at the face of another Buttonhook Man towering above her. Silver e reaching towards her, speaking the unspoken threat of *disappearance*. Sending her wherever her mother had been sent.

Julianne was sitting on the carpet with arms around her legs. She rocked back and forth. Watched helplessly as Pari seemed poised to meet her end at the hooks of the creature from the black.

“It says my… my mum is… She’s…” Pari didn’t finish any of her sentences.

Julianne crawled over the floor towards me and tugged at my hand. “We need to… to go…”

I nodded and looked at the Buttonhook Man, whose attention had shot to Julianne and me: the two loose ends threatening to escape. With that, I understood this creature. Well, of course, I didn’t understand it. It was a horror from another world; one I wouldn’t possibly ever hope to understand. But I understood Tom’s fatal flaw.

He had threatened to tattle.

“Please just let us leave with her,” I begged the Buttonhook Man. “We won’t tell a soul what we saw. I promise.”

I don’t know whether it understood me. Don’t know whether it even spoke our language. But I do know that the ‘man’ observed me for a second. Recognised my cowardice. Recognised that I was telling the truth: in that moment, I *truly* intended to never tell a soul.

A promise I have only broken now, after nearly three decades.

The bedroom light burst to life, and the Buttonhook Men vanished with the dark.

But the Fun Four survived that night in body only.

Tom never showed up, no matter how hard the police searched. Pari ended up in a psychiatric ward, fractured by both the disappearance of her mother and what experts called ‘delusions’ of Buttonhook Men. My cousin, Wesley, still lives in Noplace. He says Julianne’s the town drunk these days. She works as a plumber, and a damn bad one.

As for me, I’ve lived overseas for twenty years, and I’ve teetered on being committed to psychiatric wards myself. Who would believe my story? Who would believe the supernatural things I saw that night? Well, people in Noplace, apparently. I’ve heard things over the years. Stories from Wesley. Disappearances of other citizens. Strange sightings in dark doorways. Unearthly things.

I didn’t used to care. Noplace was on the other side of the world from me.

But now it’s happening everywhere. People are going missing. That’s why I’m sharing my story here. You see, I’ve been seeing *them* again. In doorways. In the shade. Glints of silver. Outlines of things far from men. They’re not upholding the deal, so what’s the use in keeping hush anymore? What’s the use in keeping my promise?

The Buttonhook Men are coming for us all.

I realised that yesterday when my elderly neighbour, a sweet French lady named Susie, said familiar words over coffee.

“There’s nothing in the doorway.”

My heart seized in fear, much as it did back in ‘98, but not as sharply as it did this morning.

Susie has disappeared.

They’re not just in Noplace. Maybe they never were.

So, I’m currently about to board a flight back to my hometown. Back to see Wesley and make heads and tails of this horror.

Before it makes me disappear too.

Before I find out where those people went.

We got close quite quickly, we have the same sense of humour, agree on a lot of the same things and there just generally is a connection between us I can not explain or put my finger on. Everyone who knows us both can not understand what I see in him but there is something I see that no one else does.

Comments on how close we were have been made, how much we got on and even made comments to me about how much he clearly liked me. I always passed this off as others reading into something that wasn’t there, we were friends and we just got on really well. We never even spoke to each other outside of work.

Fast forward a year or so and something seemed to shift between us. I couldn’t explain what started it or how it came to be as it happened so naturally. We started flirting more, we spoke out of work and people started picking up on feelings we didn’t think we were making obvious. I was told when I walk in the office they noticed his eyes immediately fell on me, was told when I am not there all he does is speak about me. He even knew the date we first started working together so knew how long ago we’d met. I was even told by those who mutually know his still girlfriend (29F) who I think he has been with for 8yrs that she had asked who I was so it was clear he had spoken about me at home in whatever capacity. I put all this down to work place gossip and people having nothing better to do then entertain themselves with a soap opera of other people’s lives. I was told the smile on my face when I saw him said it all, that anything he asked me for wasn’t a case of I’ll do it when I have time it was immediate I did anything he asked even as simple as dropping everything to make him a drink (at this point I know what coffee he drinks/ how many sugars/ even how many times a day).

Things progressed and we sent messages we should not have sent being in relationships to each other and it went on for months. Nothing physical happened but he told me he loved me and if I left my partner he would leave his so we could be together. I declined the offer. He has moved to another branch of the company now so we don’t see each other and my feelings began to fade I put it down to lust for someone I saw all the time and found attractive.

We went to a company event last week and it was the first time we had seen each other in a long time and all the feelings I thought had faded came back. He looked good, we gravitated to each other like we had before and again it feels so natural to do so. He made it clear he still has some feelings towards me, that if he was not in a relationship with his girlfriend I would be who he wanted.

Now I can not stop over thinking it, I am sure he is aware of how I feel as much as I try to down play it. I try to tell myself he is playing his feelings off to as he has said he values me as a friend but I don’t act how I do with my other male friends as I do with him and I doubt he acts with his female friends how he does with me.

We are both in relationships and I do love my partner (32M) we have been together 4yrs. We have a nice life together, he truly loves me and I know he does people would only dream of having someone love me the way my partner loves me but I still think about this other guy.

TLDR - I (30F) have feelings for someone else (33M) other than my partner (32M) lol. It was made clear the feelings were reciprocated at one stage but not anymore. I still feel the same and I am torn.

Have I fallen for someone who clearly has no interest in me or should I end my relationship and make my feelings for him (33M) clear and see if he does feel the same way?",0,1762223214.0,relationship_advicePH,3,0.14,False

I'm that guy who's always last-minute on gifts (Christmas just wrecked me). So I built GoSuggestAI.com—a free AI tool that generates personalized gift lists in seconds. Input occasion, budget, details → Bam, 3–5 ideas with Amazon links.

Example: 'Christmas for coffee-loving sister, under $30' → It suggested a custom mug ($12), gourmet beans ($18), and a funny coaster set ($8). All clickable!

It's live now (powered by Gemini AI), and I'm hustling to make it better for holidays like Christmas. Try it and roast my suggestions? Feedback welcome—does it beat endless Amazon scrolling?

Male and 32 and married is important I guess. I grew up in the barren ""backwoods"" deserts of Arizona with little social skills needed and my adult life shows it. I got a couple real good friends, but some nights people are busy and I'm bored. I moved out here 14 years ago and don't go outside much because I'm full of anxiety.

Pro-LGBTQ, anti-Trump, 420 friendly, I don't drink much but I don't mind alcohol, videogames are fun but hard (ADHD), very techy with vintage/retro/modern tech of all sorts (tism). I drive a Leaf so I'm not fun with car stuff, yes I know how to fix cars no I won't fix them. I drink too much iced coffee. Love to take amateur photos of nature. Blue collar worker fixing appliances day to day. Spend most of my time sitting at home uncertain of what to do and love to be drug out to stuff against my will instead.

I can be shy and very nervous to open up and actually start talking at times in person, so talking in text works wonders for me as far as warming up. I got Telegram and Reddit Chat and heck we got this post here.",29,1762222894.0,nashville,4,0.9,False

Friendly neighbor that enjoys voyeurism, Hotwife, and solo female play. Wildly entertaining, generally funny, and can hold a conversation over coffee especially in a small cafe. Enjoy walks around the neighborhood set to timely music. Won’t offer to share my sunglasses if it’s sunny.

Aside from that. I am 45 year old straight male. 6 foot, 220 and Just at 7 down below but depends on the weather or if “I was in the pool!!!”. Wildly educated professional with too much student loan debt but not enough that I can’t buy drinks. I work in the IT field so I enjoy the flexibility of working remote and onsite as well.

Let’s chat! Open to singles and couples. Looking for a good connection with consistency as I feel that helps overall progression into kink.
