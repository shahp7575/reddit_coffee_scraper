1lxwyu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortZoneChronicles/comments/1lxwyu4/lets_talk_about_performing_at_open_mic_night_for/,Let‚Äôs talk about performing at open mic night for the first time,"So, last week I did something that felt completely out of character for me‚ÄîI signed up for an open mic night at a local coffee shop. I've always loved singing in the shower or whimsically when I'm home alone, but the idea of doing it in front of people? Terrifying. üò¨ But here's the thing: I've always felt this pull towards expressing myself through music, even though I've been too scared to let anyone hear me.

I decided to sign up partly because a close friend of mine wouldn't stop nudging me (thanks, you kind of rock), and partly because I was tired of letting fear rule my choices. Standing on that small stage, staring out at an audience with their cups of coffee and expectant smiles, I felt like my heart was gonna leap outta my chest. Honestly, I was shaking a little, clutching the mic stand as my lifeline.

But then... I sang. And wow, it wasn't perfect, not even close. I screwed up the lyrics at one point, and my voice cracked here and there, which made me blush so hard. But I kinda stuck with it, and you know what? People clapped at the end! Even cheered a bit! The thrill when I finished was unreal, and it felt like a huge cloud of anxiety had lifted.

This little step was a massive deal for me. Overcoming the fear of looking foolish or incompetent‚Äîthose are big hurdles, right? But I guess this experience showed me that people tend to be supportive rather than critical, and being a bit vulnerable can actually be super liberating. Has anyone else here tried something like this and felt their legs turning to jelly but managed to push through? Would love to hear your stories!",1,1752315073.0,ComfortZoneChronicles,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 34-year-old guy from Palestine, hoping to find a wonderful woman for a serious relationship, either online or locally if we‚Äôre close. I‚Äôm all about building a meaningful connection filled with shared passions, deep talks, and plenty of laughter. A bit about me: By day, I‚Äôm an accountant, crunching numbers with a knack for keeping things balanced. Outside of work, I‚Äôm diving into a good book, battling it out in video games, or jamming to music. I‚Äôm a movie enthusiast, and I‚Äôm always up for a coffee fueled chat about life, stories, or the universe. Growing up in Palestine has given me a deep appreciation for resilience and connection, and I‚Äôd love to share my world while learning about yours. What I‚Äôm looking for: A kind, open-hearted woman who‚Äôs ready for a relationship grounded in trust and mutual respect. Bonus points if you love a strong cup of coffee, have a favorite book or game to recommend, or enjoy late-night movie discussions!

My son was born at 35 weeks and it's been four in the NICU. 

Then we went back to the NICU a few weeks later due to anemia and required a blood transfusion so that he could be able to properly maintain his weight as well as body heat. However the social worker there, we were told was not the normal social worker, called CYS so we had to deal with that for a few weeks but everything went smoothly

And yesterday my wife had on the coffee table with the portable changing Matt to change him and he shimmied off and fell into the floor. 

We went to the hospital and long story short we had to go to a children's hospital about an hour away so they could look at a skull fracture that's rather tiny. 

He's doing absolutely fine and has shown zero sign so we're looking at being discharged today. 

However due to the fact of the nature of the injury CYS was called. He were just out of the woods and we just got notification that it was over and now we're back in it again though for completed a reason. 

Due to how far away we are from home we were told that we can be discharged today and we just have to meet CYS at our house to put a quote action plan in place"".

I'm dealing with that then emotional PTSD from this all I still haven't recovered from the first time. 

And lastly work. I told work what happened and they were like go, don't need to ask just go. Howard lactose stole bad due to it my boss made a thing about it but at this point I don't care I need to be there for my son. 

I spend my Friday night and a children's hospital with my wife while she slapped I stayed up and took care of my son with feedings 

They had my son transported to the children's hospital with my wife and I had to drive here for about 2 hours and I had a pull over a few times cuz I felt like I was going to throw off them how physically sick this whole thing is making me and I never knew I could feel so much pain in English


Not only do I feel so help us that I can't protect them and we have to go and deal with Cos but I never been so scared in my life .

* **What makes it special:** The old-school brick oven and homey atmosphere make Brothers‚Äô feel like a family meal. You‚Äôll often see locals gathering here in the evenings. The crust comes out thin and crisp, and you can even order half-and-half pizzas to sample two flavors at once.  
* **Must-try pizza:** Try the **Ravenna Bacon Pizza** ‚Äì it‚Äôs loaded with four kinds of cheese, mushrooms, fresh tomato, olives *and* crispy bacon. It‚Äôs rich and savory.

# County Club Cafe & Pizzeria (Wood Fired Pizza)

***Wood-Fired Wonders in Every Bite!***

https://preview.redd.it/5bxacntp0fcf1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=7899435bc8e160a4749b3e1a212dd16b210c11a1

* **Must-try pizza:** The menu can vary, but favorites include the **Paneer Tikka Pizza** (topped with spiced Indian paneer cheese) and the **Pepperoni Pizza**. The paneer pizza adds an Indian twist, while the pepperoni is a great example of how they handle traditional Italian toppings.

https://preview.redd.it/pl79kvv41fcf1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f8874ed686bdac20aff8583e4778a233b1864f

The owner (Laxminarayan) even took the name Laxmee after himself.

* **What makes it special:** Every pizza here is vegan by default ‚Äì the cheese and toppings are all plant-based. You‚Äôd never guess it, though; they use flavorful substitutes like seasoned tofu and plenty of veggies. A reviewer sums it up: ‚ÄúDelicious wood fire vegan pizza that exceeded my expectations!

I am F (34) and he is M (35). I just want to share my story to have a place to vent out and finally let my tears freely flow as i write.

We started as two broken souls. Both of us came from the wreckage of past relationships ‚Äî both cheated on, both tired, both trying to believe in love again. We didn‚Äôt fall fast. We took our time. We talked, laughed, shared wounds quietly, slowly, without pressure. Then one day, we simply realized we weren‚Äôt broken anymore ‚Äî at least not in the way we were before.

We healed together.

He wasn‚Äôt just my boyfriend. He was my home. We loved each other the kind of way that makes life feel less scary ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre young and struggling. Our wallets were thin, but our hearts were full. We would travel on shoestring budgets, laugh at how broke we were, and eat cheap street food with stars in our eyes like we were in some indie film.

Every little win ‚Äî like a job offer or a passed exam ‚Äî felt like our win. Every struggle ‚Äî missed opportunities, family issues, failed plans ‚Äî felt bearable because we had each other.

I loved him when he had nothing.

No car. No savings. No fancy lifestyle. Just dreams ‚Äî and I loved every one of them. I believed in him before he believed in himself. I stood beside him while he built everything from the ground up.

When he got his first job, we celebrated like he‚Äôd won the lottery. We even joked about how rich we‚Äôd be someday. Our kind of rich was simple: a house filled with love, two kids, lazy Sunday mornings, and matching coffee mugs. We thought love was enough ‚Äî and for a while, it really was.

Our friends used to say we were ‚Äúthe strong couple.‚Äù The one that would make it. The one that grew from nothing and would grow old still holding hands. And I believed that. We both did.

That was the love story we were writing.

And maybe that‚Äôs why it hurts so much now ‚Äî because for a long time, it was real.",2,1752313907.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

No. I come to you as a concerned citizen of the internet, a lover of language, a supporter of stories‚Äîand a firm believer that we can do better, and last but not least, a loyal user of AO3, dare I say a lover, a lover of all that it stands for.

Fanfiction, my friends, has served its purpose. It has given us comfort in the dark, joy in the mundane, and catharsis when canon failed us. It has provided a playground for experimentation, for identity, for self-expression. But it is time we face a hard truth:

Fanfiction is cheap.

Not in the emotional sense‚Äîoh no, in that realm, it‚Äôs priceless. But structurally? Creatively? 90% of the work is already done for you. The characters, the world, the lore, the tone‚Äîborrowed. Sometimes even the plot. You don‚Äôt have to invent the engine‚Äîyou just soup it up and paint flames on the side.

And for many years, this was a gift. A gateway. A low-barrier-of-entry that helped so many of us become confident storytellers.

But the time has come to evolve.

AO3 is a platform bursting with potential. It has the infrastructure, the tagging system, the community engagement‚Äîall ripe for greatness. But we limit it. We hobble it. We cling to familiar IPs like toddlers with blankies, when we could be building the next great literary movement.

Why should the next Frankenstein, Dracula, or Pride and Prejudice be buried under 37,000 ‚ÄúGeraskier coffee shop AUs‚Äù? Why should the next Dune or Witcher be smothered in an ocean of ‚Äúwhat if Daenerys had Twitter‚Äù crackfics?

Let AO3 become the home of original genius.

Let us write bold new worlds, unshackled by canon. Let us populate them with characters who belong to us‚Äînot corporate franchises or long-dead novelists. Let‚Äôs rewire our brains not to ask ‚ÄúWhat if Dean and Castiel kissed on the moon?‚Äù but instead: ‚ÄúWhat if I created a universe where love on the moon is illegal, and two rogue astronauts are willing to risk it all?‚Äù

AO3 could be the new Gutenberg Press. But we‚Äôre treating it like Tumblr‚Äôs attic.

You want respect for your work? You want it studied in classrooms, dissected in think pieces, adapted into prestige miniseries?

You won‚Äôt get it by writing 400k words of ‚ÄúHarry Potter becomes a mob boss and marries Draco.‚Äù

You might get it by writing the next original Harry-Draco dynamic, in a world all your own. With names that are yours. With lore that didn‚Äôt come from another writer's far more talented mind.

Now, this is not a call to erase fanfiction. It is a call to graduate. To transcend.

To take the skills you've honed‚Äîworldbuilding, dialogue, tension, angst, emotional payoff‚Äîand use them to build something new.

Fanfiction got you here. It taught you to write. It gave you community. It healed you.

But now?

It is stuck. It is refusing to evolve.

And if AO3 continues to do so? If it continues to cling stubbornly to its identity as a digital shrine to fan-made epilogues, smut, and canon fix-its?

Then it may die.

Not dramatically, not in a blaze of deleted servers‚Äîbut quietly. Forgotten. Replaced. Passed over by younger generations who see it as a relic of a time when no one believed in their own ideas. Already, platforms like Wattpad and Royal Road have quite correctly pivoted to showcasing original works. Already, independent authors are becoming mainstream successes‚Äîwithout needing Harry Styles in disguise to carry them there.

If AO3 wants to remain relevant, it cannot remain stagnant.

So I say this with love, with urgency, and with hope: Let‚Äôs build something new. Let AO3 be remembered not just as the fanfic archive that comforted millions, but as the birthplace of the next literary renaissance.

Thank you.",0,1752313834.0,AO3,35,0.03,False

Future Mate,

I‚Äôm a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who‚Äôs also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I‚Äôm talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I‚Äôve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something‚Äôs missing... a mate who‚Äôs down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some ‚Äúlife unpacking‚Äù over coffee or a fire pit.

What I‚Äôm not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

I'd love to share some selfies, talk about deal breakers first up to avoid wasting each other's time and fast tracking if we have the potential to connect even.

Prologue 

My grandfather was a Catholic priest, through and through. His faith, unwavering in public, seemed to stand like a monument against the more fractured truth of his private life. He bore discomfort the way others might bear a calling‚Äîwith solemnity, and a kind of studied silence, as though endurance were not only expected, but sanctifying. He revered St √âtienne‚ÄîStephen‚Äîthe first to kneel beneath judgment without revoking his words. A deacon, appointed to serve, stoned for a conviction others could not bear to hear. He once sent me a small book about him, the pages brittle, the margins marked. In those quiet underlinings I think he found something to admire‚Äînot triumph, but submission. Martyrdom, to him, was not a blaze of glory but the still, obedient hush of one who believes to the end, and bears the cost without protest. Perhaps this was his way of making sense of his own divided life‚Äîthe secret whispered about in cloisters, the private sacrifice that came bundled with love and consequence.

He had a child‚Äîmy mother‚Äîwho arrived into the world as a scandal. She was conceived during an affair with a married woman, my grandmother, and that alone was enough to shape the course of several lives. My grandmother was sent away to carry the pregnancy in silence, hidden in a convent where the nuns offered more obedience than compassion, and whose midwifery training was spoken of only in whispers. After the birth, she moved counties but was allowed to remain, briefly, in her former husband‚Äôs house‚Äînot as wife, but as housekeeper, a gesture that said more about appearances than mercy. She left that life altered‚Äînot quite respectable, not quite forgiven. It was the kind of transgression the Church had no rite for, no absolution neatly prepared. Only silence, and the long echo of it.

For years, Mum and I lived with her. I remember Grandma smelling faintly of polish and lilies, moving with an upright stillness, like someone holding herself together by long habit more than conviction. Her house was the closest I ever came to safety, though even there, something low and electric hummed behind the wallpaper. The church sat nearby‚Äînot watching, but judging. And the judgment wasn‚Äôt resisted; it was received, as something righteous and enduring. My grandfather hung in a photograph above the mantel, holding me as a baby, his fingers careful, as though I might stain his sleeves. We even went to church every Sunday. Grandma never came. I didn‚Äôt understand why‚Äînot then. But some silences don‚Äôt fade. They deepen. They take root.

When Grandma moved into assisted living, my mother found us a place of our own‚ÄîKing Street. A narrow terrace with a garden of cracked paving stones and weeds that always returned, no matter how often they were pulled. I remember the door creaking as she pushed it shut with her thumb. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make it ours,‚Äù she said, though even then her voice carried the tremor of uncertainty. I was seven or eight. The hallway sloped at a strange angle, and the curtains never quite met‚Äîlike halves of a promise no one had the strength to keep. Light came through, but it never settled.

My mother struggled to live independently. The freezer leaked a faint, sour smell. The radiators clanged like old bones waking in the walls. Bills came too often, too high. She moved through it all like someone caught in a riptide‚Äîstraining toward the shore, but dragged sideways by a stronger force. I stayed close. I made her milky coffee in the mornings. Slipped ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù notes into her coat pockets like offerings. I listened to her stories‚Äîhalf-believing, half-knowing‚Äîbecause sometimes even a child senses when a truth has been dressed up to survive.

One afternoon, she looked down at my worn school shoes and said, ‚ÄúI need to marry a rich man. Or I won‚Äôt be able to put shoes on your feet.‚Äù There was no anger in it‚Äîno sharpness, no plea. Just the flat chill of a forecast, the kind that comes after too many years of waiting for change. It was helplessness, worn smooth by repetition. I think she was tired‚Äîworn thin by the strangeness of her life, by the ache of compromises made too early and too often. And yet she clung to her faith, not as consolation but as contradiction‚Äîstill believing, somehow, in a God she imagined might disapprove of her.

She told stories like broken fairy tales, and my own origin was no exception. She said she was frightened when she learned she was pregnant, but after seeing a man with a wooden leg stumble by in an underground station, she found a strange sort of hope‚Äîif he could survive, so could she. She told me she‚Äôd hidden me in a drawer after giving birth. ‚ÄúBottom one. Next to the paracetamol,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, lighting a cigarette. I pictured myself curled there, among cotton wool and hairbrushes‚Äîhidden, but never safe. She whispered of strange things from nursing school: people who hurt themselves for attention, rumours of poison. ‚ÄúMad as anything,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome people will do anything to be seen.‚Äù

Her stories seldom matched the world around me. There‚Äôs a photograph‚Äîme as a baby, cradled in Grandma‚Äôs arms‚Äîsoft light washing over a pink cardigan, her hands folded gently, as if offering a benediction. There was care there, even love, but it stood shadowed by contradiction. I was a child marked by the Church, yet never fully claimed by it‚Äîcaught in that silent space between belonging and exile. Even then, I sensed the dissonance, the fractures beneath the surface. Still, I was drawn to her whispered truths, captivated and wary, believing more than I dared admit.

Being the child of a priest leaves a mark that no rules can quite erase. The Church‚Äôs laws are clear about vows and silence, but they do not easily account for the lives caught in between‚Äîthose shaped by secrets too heavy to name. That weight doesn‚Äôt stay in the past. It slips into everything‚Äîthe way linens are folded, the hush when the phone rings late, the names no one speaks aloud. Grandma bore it in exile. Her daughter carried it not as grief, but as instinct‚Äîa carefulness that shaped her voice, her movements, her silences. And I inherited it too, though I didn‚Äôt yet have words for it. Only a sense that safety had to be earned through stillness. That love meant not being a burden. That disappearing was the surest way to stay.

The faith that surrounded us was not the radiant kind that ends in redemption, but a slower, quieter one‚Äîan endurance of what cannot be undone. Grace wasn‚Äôt a revelation, but a breath in the dark. And the quiet in the house was never peace. 

It was the kind of silence that gathers like gas in a cellar. The kind you learn to breathe in.

Team DP : 15

Mirai Trunks Mid-Thirties

Base Vegito

Yajirobe

13/15 DP Used

Breakdown :

I started out with Mirai SSJ Trunks Mid- Thirties, because I wanted to challenge myself as I found his moveset to be the biggest letdown of the game.

I had no expectations for this run.

The battle begins with me testing Trunks‚Äô melee abilities, and in typical Trunks fashion, he ends up flying across the screen in the opposite direction of his opponent.

Being the original hero of time, I let Trunks run the gamut with his dash, heavy strike, and ultimate giving respectable damage, but I felt his actual impact, and recovery post ultimates, and supers was too sloth-like.

I got frustrated with his wasted potential after barely draining at least roughly one health bar from Whis in the span of a moment.

I quickly switched to Base Vegito who dragged Whis‚Äô face into the ground, and rubbed it in his face while using his feet to do combat in melee, going toe to toe using quick reflexes to get the best of Whis, until Whis got frustrated, and began spamming ki blasts, while Vegito focused on deflection as he started inserting distance between he, and the enraged angel.

After getting far enough, he transformed into Super Vegito, and began to troll Whis as the angel attempted to go sparking, blocking him from doing so, until Super Vegito grew impatient, and beam sworded him.


After wasting a few health bars, Super Vegito goes Blue, and wreaks havoc on the angel, until Vegito Blue‚Äôs fusion runs out, but not after beating Whis to an inch of his lifebar.

As Mirai Trunks sat out most of the battle due to the limitations of his skills, he was still fresh with full health.

Smelling the blood in the air, Future Trunks wastes no time charging his Spirit Sword, and sends the Angel to the Netherlands, thus securing his future, and not being arrested by the time cops for his grievous actions by way of meddling with timelines.

All in all, Vegito carried the battle on his back. The win could have gone to either Trunks or Yajirobe, but the soul of the team is soon to be chained, and betrayed in a space of time and space.

Reward : The satisfaction of defeating the smug angel.

Ideal reward : The CPU difficulty program, which could be used for training, and cpu battles in game for players to test themselves.

1lxwb4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/brew/comments/1lxwb4o/bitter_woes/,Bitter woes.,"I have for my sins a sage smart grinder pro grinder and a DeLonghi ec685 machine. Which I am aware are not the best but are the best  space wise and financially for me circumstances.
 
I read over and over that 17 grams into the grinder should give when ground 17 out.
That I can set.
That at 2:1 I should aim for 17x2 = 34 grams of liquid coffee.
That should take approx 30 seconds to brew.
 
All the above is fine except the 30 seconds, from first drip it is normally 8-9 seconds to get +-34 grams liquid.
If I make the grind as fine  as possible then it increases to 10 seconds.

Either time gives a very bitter coffee no matter what brand, roast,or acidity.
What does tend to stop the bitterness is to grind coarser and brew at 2:1 and not worry about the time.
This not using the supplied basket but a  proper basket.

If I fill that to 20 grams the ground beans press on the head hence the 17 g I use.
So I‚Äôm wondering why does this machine push the water through so fast and does really matter how long it takes?

1lxwaf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lxwaf8/is_oxford_nice_to_walk_around/,Is Oxford nice to walk around?,"Just got back from an incredible day trip exploring Oxford, and I have to share my experience walking through this stunning university city. It's honestly one of the most walkable places I've visited in England.

The city center is compact and perfectly designed for pedestrians. What struck me most was how the ancient college buildings, with their honey-colored stone, create these magical corridors and passageways that seem to transport you back in time. Every corner reveals another architectural masterpiece or hidden courtyard.

I recently joined a day tour from London that included Oxford, Stratford-upon-Avon, and the Cotswolds (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/London). The Oxford portion was definitely a highlight - our guide showed us secret spots I would've missed on my own, like the Bridge of Sighs and the beautiful Radcliffe Camera.

The best part? Most of Oxford's main attractions are within a 15-20 minute walk of each other. You can easily stroll from the iconic Bodleian Library to Christ Church College (where they filmed Harry Potter scenes!) without breaking a sweat. The riverside walks along the Thames and Cherwell are particularly peaceful, especially in spring when the rowing teams practice.

Something I really appreciated was the mix of bustling student life and quiet, contemplative spaces. One minute you're in the busy Covered Market, sampling local foods and browsing quirky shops, the next you're in a tranquil college garden that hasn't changed in centuries.

A few practical tips from my experience:
- Wear comfortable shoes - the cobblestone streets are charming but can be tricky
- Start early to avoid tourist crowds, especially around popular colleges
- Many colleges charge entrance fees, but their gardens are worth it
- The side streets often have the best photo opportunities
- Grab a coffee at one of the historic cafes where famous authors once wrote

While you can explore Oxford independently, I found the guided tour invaluable for understanding the city's rich history and accessing places I might have missed. The tour I mentioned earlier was perfect because it combined Oxford with other iconic English locations, making the most of a day trip from London.

Oxford isn't just nice to walk around - it's spectacular. The combination of historic architecture, academic atmosphere, and green spaces makes every walk feel like you're stepping through pages of history. If you're planning a trip to England, don't miss the chance to explore this remarkable city on foot.

For anyone interested in experiencing Oxford along with Stratford and the Cotswolds, I highly recommend booking through that link I shared. The small group size means you get a more personal experience, and the guides really know their stuff.",1,1752312284.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False
1lxw8l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lxw8l8/i_found_siruvani_whole_beans_on_amazon/,I found siruvani whole beans on amazon,"Hi guys, I heard a few discussions about this coffee brand in this subreddit, but people were mentioning how they only shipped ground coffee and there was no way to buy whole beans from them other than physically visiting their store.

But today, I found them selling whole beans on Amazon. The packaging color is a bit different, since the ground coffee comes in black packaging and this one has a silver pack, so I just want to confirm if it's the same coffee that a lot of people were complimenting.

Also, I would really appreciate it if anyone can compare it to Hunkal's Aranya Gold.

I came to this resort with high expectations and it delivered good, really good. Everything from the food to the entertainment just screamed TUI quality. The place is huge, so it‚Äôs great if you like walking or staying active. The landscaping was super pretty too, very aesthetically pleasing. Rooms were clean and comfy, and housekeeping did a solid job. The pools were a bit on the smaller side compared to other resorts, but still totally fine. The main focus is definitely the beach, but the sea was super wavy and had a lot of seaweed, so not the best for swimming. The sand was super fine and kinda sticky too, which wasn‚Äôt ideal. I really loved the beach bar ""Purple Turtle"", at night they either had disco or live concerts, which were super fun. Drinks were pretty good too. Food-wise, there was something for literally everyone. Tons of variety. Breakfast, lunch, dinner...everything was well done. And if you‚Äôve got a sweet tooth, you're in luck because the dessert selection was insane. Staff were all really friendly and helpful.

Some extra stuff: it‚Äôs only about a 5-minute walk to the local shops, which is super convenient. There are also sports activities like tennis, yoga, and fitness classes. There‚Äôs a Kids‚Äô Club too. Outside the lobby, there are a bunch of little shops like a market, jewelry store, hairdresser, photographer, and also Levante, the A La Carte restaturant(there is one at the hillside too, called Sunset View/Anadolu Restaurant, and one BBQ near the beach). The lobby has a snack bar that‚Äôs open 24/7 and there‚Äôs a coffee place as well. Outside, there‚Äôs The Bar, which had nice drinks.

Oh, and I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend the lunch at the Pool Bar‚Äîit was kinda meh. The one at the Purple Turtle was way better and had more variety. One thing I really appreciated: the bathrooms were spotless, always clean. Finally, big thanks to staff for their immaculate service and friendliness.

But my wife is constantly staring at her phone and can spend up to 3 hours on a Saturday morning just doing that. So sometimes I feel I need to compensate, as if I'm not careful I'll just think to myself ""I might as well do the same"". But that's not really in my nature as I don't like sitting down and being unproductive. 

Let's say it's Saturday morning. Everyone loves a lazy Saturday. I wake up and I will look at my emails in the morning with a coffee, check news headlines, check Reddit notifications, maybe a game of Wordle. Max 20-30 mins really. 

That's it for me while the kids do their chilled things.  But I'm not good at doing nothing in the meantime, so here's where I struggle if the wife is locked on her phone and the kids are doing their thing. So I might spend the next hour or two while kids watch TV and wife is on her phone:

Cooking breakfast for the kids and wife. 

Cleaning the kitchen. 

Go to the shop for supplies. 

Put some laundry on. 

Maybe play some guitar. 

Maybe catch up on some work. 

Plan what to cook for dinner. 

Basically, anything other than stare at phone. 

Evenings can be similar. It goes without saying I might get everyone out the house (wife included!) so we can do family stuff together. But I'm more curious about the time spent indoors, first thing in the morning, or in the evening when people tend to settle down. What you do to keep busy?

I don't know what I'm asking really. I guess, for other men who similarly like to keep busy rather than fall back into screen time, what is your morning routine like, what do you do to keep busy other than look at the phone?

I appreciate this is very much a ridiculous, modern problem. I'm in my 40s and can't actually remember what I used to do in the mornings when I was in my 20s before major smartphone usage. Maybe watch TV? Who knows.   ",7,1752311821.0,AskMen,15,1.0,False

I knew the anecdote about the treaties of the coffee plantation between GDR and Vietnam in the 80s and that the Business Partner GDR had ceased to exist when the first coffee was ripe.

What I didn't know was that GDR also provided housing, hospitals and shops as a new infrastructure because the new coffee plantations were started in nowhere. 

So this means that approximately thousands of people were uprooted to tend to the new cultivations. 

So, how did that happen seen from the Vietnam side of things? 

Do you have family stories? 

Was it voluntary? I mean were those sought after jobs people were happy to apply for or were people mandated to uproot themselves and their families and go there? 

And how is life in the coffee area now? Do you see a difference between the artificially founded villages/ towns and the naturally grown ones? 

When I have that right there was a shift from tea culture to coffee culture in Vietnam rooted in the decision made in Eastern Germany to avoid a second Boston Tea Party. 
How did that influence the economics and just about everything, or do I see that wrong? 

Thanks in advance,

Okay so I 18 F (genderfluid) went on my senior trip with my school on May 13 and came back on May 15. I‚Äôm being loose with the information because I graduated May 29th 2025 and honestly don‚Äôt care anymore. On day one we got there at the bus stop at 3am all was good me and my friends were excited and happy. We get on the bus and I wanted to sit with my friend will call her Tammy. Before I could sit with Tammy Alexa sat down next to her. Me and Tammy said it‚Äôs whatever because Alexa is our best friend. Day one is fine other than the short waits at universal studios and Alexa refusing to redo a few fun rides and threatening to move on to the next ride without me or Tammy. 

Now here‚Äôs where things started to really go south. By morning I got up super early I‚Äôm talking 5:30am early. Tammy was cool with it because she wanted to find the perfect outfit for Disney in the morning. While I on the other hand needed to shower before I was on my cycle again. Things were perfect Alexa decided that she wanted to sleep in as she should since out of the three of us she stayed up super late. Probably about 1:00am or 2:00am me and Tammy on the other hand slept fell asleep probably around 12:00am. Regardless we waited to wake her up around 6:40am which would give her 20 minutes to get ready before breakfast time. By the time it was breakfast we showed up late because it took forever to wake up Alexa. By the time we got downstairs we were ready for some food. Alexa had snapped at me and Tammy for multiple reasons. For starters we got up to early even though we discussed that we would be waking up this early multiple times throughout the day before we got to the hotel. Then we didn‚Äôt wake her up early enough even though she said not to wake her up. Then there was us being ready before her and ready to get food without her. Check out was at 7:40am and we all had to be downstairs and ready to go at 7:50 so we could leave at 8:00am. Finally the last reason she snapped at us was because we left our luggage in the room and convinced her to do the same since me and Tammy both thought we would come back to the room after Disney land which we were wrong. Alexa yelled at us over the situation making me and Tammy feel really bad about the situation. Which we know it was a mistake which led us to being even more late to breakfast we had to get staff to get us a card to let us into the room. Alexa with a attitude grabbed her stuff and left while me and Alexa had to scramble together to grab the food that was in fact mostly Alexa‚Äôs and pack pack up what remained of our supplies from the day prior. We made it out around probably 7:45am and got lucky because the teachers went to the bathroom and we‚Äôre taking a super long time the didn‚Äôt leave till around 8:00am to 8:10am.  Me and Tammy got food which Tammy was super happy while I was still stressed out from the morning and struggled to eat a pancake. Alexa‚Äôs excuse for her attitude was that she was hungry and needed her coffee as well. So we brushed it off because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day over such a petty thing. We walked a few blocks to the park which let me calm down. We got food at the Starbucks which was pretty good Tammy tried my food which was the impossible breakfast sandwich and a custom drink from Lemon8 and Tammy was impressed. While Alexa judged my food choice and insulted my impossible breakfast sandwich (I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian but for context back in 2015 to 2016 then 2018 to 2019 my parents became vegetarians so I‚Äôm open to a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and love the breakfast sandwich from Starbucks). 

Now fast forward after several long waits throughout the park Alexa is asks ‚Äúdo we want to have dinner with my boyfriend and his friends?‚Äù Me and Tammy said ‚Äúno‚Äù. For context we aren‚Äôt a fan of one of Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs friends for some stuff he did to my other friend which I won‚Äôt be getting to into at the moment. The rest of his friends we don‚Äôt know or like he‚Äôs friends with a few dirt bags and some don‚Äôt know how to act in public. Think the stereotype of a group of guys in 7th grade but just stuck in the body of 17, 18, and 19 year olds. Gross people who make inappropriate jokes that make others feel uncomfortable while being obnoxious and very loud. Some of them have been kicked out of places because they made people feel uncomfortable or upset. Another way to think of them would be the people who participate in Minecraft movies type of guys. Throwing buckets and bags of popcorn yelling causing a scene dancing but hitting people around them and making messes they won‚Äôt clean up. Overall we weren‚Äôt going anywhere near that chaos. So I explained after everything the guy did that hurt my friend I just don‚Äôt want to be around him because I know I won‚Äôt be able to hold my tongue if he says anything to me. (Off topic he started dating a girl who threatened harm towards me when me and my ex got into a fight. It was so bad I had to get a form of restraining order against her which he knows I was and still am very mad at him. I can‚Äôt be around him.) Alexa didn‚Äôt like my response and made the statement of ‚Äúcommon op please I just want to spend time with my boyfriend if I can make sacrifices for you and your ex when you were 15 then you can make sacrifices for me and my boyfriend and his friends‚Äù. For context the ex she‚Äôs referencing if my abusive ex that I got with when I was 15 and he was almost 18 I don‚Äôt want to get into the details of what happened in this post but when he turned 18 and I was still 15 he became abusive and then wanted me to become a teen mom to his children (I posted on this in the past it was a traumatic experience and I overall don‚Äôt talk about it often now without having a panic attack). Thanks to this I stopped talking for a good 15, 20 minutes just from shock since the topic of my ex was out of nowhere I almost cried I had to pull myself together since I was in public. Honestly I say I did a pretty good job covering how I felt but Tammy checked in on me a lot I went from super chatty and happy to super quiet and distant. Which shoutout to Tammy for being awesome and taking a calmer approach to the situation of comforting me without being over the top. Alexa didn‚Äôt apologize we got on the ride after a few minutes then Alexa ignored the tension and started talking about how we should get on the boat ride to rest and see where it goes which was just in a giant circle. I told Tammy that I need some space because I felt very overwhelmed she understood that and distracted Alexa while I called my girlfriend and told her what happened without crying. She comforted me as best as she could even though she all the way in New Mexico while I‚Äôm in Disney land we hung up and I realize I was being selfish by feeling how I felt. So I sucked it up and tried my best to go back to how I felt. We went to a gift shop so I can buy a plushie but I started to actually feel unwell. It was in the 70 something degrees I felt nauseous and lightheaded (I‚Äôm low on iron and bleeding a lot walking in the heat with a sweater on) and had to sit down. Everyone was getting so I took us to downtown Disney for lunch. 

By the time I got us to Splitsville Alexa was mad because it would cost us a lot of money that we didn‚Äôt have. When I told them they don‚Äôt charge too much and a good amount for the three of us. When Alexa got mad at me and I suggested we go to California adventure and look for something there she refused. In Alexa‚Äôs own words she said ‚Äúthey charge us for being inside the restaurant and we have to order other wise we will get charged for stopping by at any other shop or restaurant.‚Äù I was very confused.  She wouldn‚Äôt elaborate no matter how much I asked. So we sat down and she gave both me and Tammy the silent treatment. Tammy on the other hand was nervous she thought we would pay around 100$ or 200$ on the food and entry fee. I love Tammy being that she‚Äôs my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt go to many restaurants compared to me or Alexa. She didn‚Äôt know if I was right or she was right but she was stressed out because she didn‚Äôt have more than 12$. I told her multiple times I‚Äôll pay for her portions but she was very nervous. Tammy was so scared she ordered a water so the bill won‚Äôt go up be to much. Me Tammy and Alexa got a cheese pizza and chicken fingers with I think a Dr Pepper and root beer with a water. Our total bill about 53$. Alexa kept looking for an entry fee saying it‚Äôs only this high because our entry fee. When I broke down the cost she was shocked. We left with our pockets still full and our stomach fuller. 

We had hopper passes so we moved to California adventure. We got there and Tammy wanted to do the guardians of the galaxy ride. Alexa was terrified and in the process got in line and out of line multiple times eventually she chose to not get in line. We waited in line for two hours. Within the two hours me and Tammy talked about the situations throughout the day Tammy was mad at Alexa for how she acted in the morning then what she said. By the time Tammy came back in line I needed to make a quick call to Amazon over an issue with a package that didn‚Äôt come on time. Yes I called Amazon at Disney in a super long line it was just to get a boring task out the way in a super long boring line. Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them. For lack of better words me and Tammy said ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù (side note look up a video of California adventures giant Ferris wheel it is actually terrifying especially how some of the carts slide and rock) we didn‚Äôt want to 3rd and 4th wheel their date. Something to take note of where not supposed to split from our group by doing so if we‚Äôre caught we will face serious consequences once where back at school. They also made the plans that if me and Tammy won‚Äôt go to dinner with Alexa and boyfriend she‚Äôll go regardless. They went to the Spider-Man ride I was annoyed so I went to tell my girlfriend again what happened. Which shoutout to my girlfriend for being so supportive and caring during that day listening to my rants on Alexa. It took them a while to get in and out which like I warned them multiple times the ride broke down on them Alexa ditched me and Tammy to hang out with her boyfriend after. Long story short me and Tammy had a great time five hours. We got boba from San Fran, Tokyo.and Tammy got to try clam chowder bowls for the first time which she‚Äôs in love with. (Off topic bread bowls besties forever need to be a shirt she loves them so much and so do I) now this is finally part that is the main reason for this post. 

As I said it‚Äôs been five hours since we heard from Alexa. It‚Äôs time to go and Tammy and I have to find her. Not just that we‚Äôre at the meeting place and couldn‚Äôt find anyone there. We called Alexa and she immediately hung up on us(side note there‚Äôs a app we were supposed to download to get updates on where we‚Äôre supposed to go Tammy is a android user and Alexa is iOS user). I didn‚Äôt have the app because we weren‚Äôt supposed to split up at all Tammy and Alexa had the app. I now know how stupid that was. Tammy‚Äôs phone was at 2% and we tried to find the meeting spot. Alexa texted the group chat and said ‚Äústop calling I‚Äôm at 25% and I need my phone we can talk on the bus‚Äù we texted saying it‚Äôs an emergency. We thought the bus got the students early because none of our classmates were around and we didn‚Äôt see our bus either. Turns out you need special permission to bring a bus to Disneyland so we had to walk to the bus about 3 miles out. The group thankfully didn‚Äôt leave yet everyone just shifted to Disneyland for the firework show. After spam calling Alexa here‚Äôs the main interaction once answer after 10 calls.

Heres a recap of the call:
Alexa: What do you want you‚Äôre killing my phone battery.
Tammy: Dude where are you me and op are lost and were freaking out did the school leave Disney.
Alexa: No where all here by the fountain.
Tammy: Cool which fountain and by what shop there‚Äôs a lot of fountains.
Alexa: The fountain on the way to the place we had lunch at.
Tammy: op said there‚Äôs a bunch of fountains Alexa where are you close by so we can head towards that location.
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Oh my f***ing gosh your friends are so (he calls us the R slur).
Alexa: you‚Äôll see it once you‚Äôre close by. 
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Tell them to use the f***ing app.
Tammy: My phone is at 2% nothing is loading I‚Äôm calling from OP‚Äôs phone.
Alexa: Just start walking when I see you I‚Äôll let you know.

I don‚Äôt recall the rest of the call other than Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend calling us the R slur and cursing at us. Alexa didn‚Äôt stop her boyfriend at all and eventually said to call her boyfriend for instructions to find the place. Me and Tammy walked almost to the monorails in downtown Disney and saw no one we had to walk back to the gates and still saw no one. It was 11pm I‚Äôm about to cry because me and Tammy are lost we don‚Äôt see anyone we recognize were getting called the R slur and cursed out by our friends boyfriend it‚Äôs late my feet hurt I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm feeling sharp pains in my legs (I have issues with my feet so if I‚Äôm on them for too long I feel sharp pain in my feet and legs I had been on them for two hours at that point with no breaks and a total of three four hours). Tammy saw my eyes start watering and started yelling and cursing at both Alexa and Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend. Their response, hang up on us. Tammy hugged me and comforted me because the whole day overall had been a drag. We got lucky and found a teacher from our school and followed him turns out they moved the first meeting spot to this random hidden corner. We later go to the main meeting spot around 11:30pm. By the time Alexa reached out to us which was 11:40 she sent the text of a shitty photo of where we later meet at to Tammy‚Äôs phone. After all this I‚Äôm thinking about going no contact with my bestie.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and appeal of a Meowdy shirt depend on several key features. From the fabric used to the design's clarity, each aspect contributes to the overall value and satisfaction of the product.

**Material Quality:**

The material used in a Meowdy shirt significantly impacts its comfort, durability, and overall feel. Higher-quality materials, such as premium cotton blends or ring-spun cotton, offer a softer touch and are less prone to shrinking or fading after washing. Cheaper materials may feel rough, uncomfortable, and wear out quickly. Look for shirts made from materials that are breathable and comfortable against the skin, especially if you plan to wear them frequently.

**Print Quality:**

A sharp, vibrant print is essential for a Meowdy shirt to truly stand out. The printing method used, whether it's screen printing, direct-to-garment (DTG), or heat transfer, affects the design's longevity and detail. Screen printing is known for its durability and vibrant colors, while DTG allows for intricate designs and gradients. Heat transfer prints, while often more affordable, may crack or peel over time. Examine the print quality closely to ensure it's clear, crisp, and resistant to fading.

**Design Uniqueness:**

The Meowdy shirt concept is simple, but the execution can vary widely. Look for shirts with unique and creative designs that set them apart from the generic options. A well-designed Meowdy shirt will feature a clever combination of cat imagery and Western themes, with attention to detail and artistic flair. Consider the font style, the cat's pose, and the overall composition of the design.

**Sizing and Fit:**

An ill-fitting shirt can ruin the entire experience, regardless of how great the design is. Pay close attention to the sizing chart provided by the manufacturer and compare it to your own measurements. Consider whether you prefer a slim fit, a relaxed fit, or a unisex fit. Some brands offer different size options for men and women, which can help ensure a more comfortable and flattering fit. Read customer reviews to get a sense of how the shirt runs in terms of size.

**Color Options:**

While the design is paramount, the color of the shirt can also play a significant role in its appeal. Consider your personal style and wardrobe when choosing a color. Neutral colors like black, gray, and navy are versatile and easy to pair with other clothing items. Brighter colors like red, yellow, or turquoise can make a bolder statement. Make sure the color complements the design and doesn't clash with it.

**Durability and Washability:**

A good Meowdy shirt should be able to withstand regular wear and washing without losing its shape, color, or print quality. Look for shirts that are pre-shrunk to minimize shrinkage after washing. Follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer to ensure the shirt lasts as long as possible. Check customer reviews to see if others have experienced any issues with fading, shrinking, or print damage after washing.

Key features of a quality Meowdy shirt include:
* Premium material for comfort and durability
* High-quality printing for vibrant and lasting designs
* Unique and creative designs that stand out
* Accurate sizing and comfortable fit
* A range of color options to suit personal preferences
* Durability and washability for long-term use

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of Meowdy shirts can raise some questions. Here are some common inquiries to help you make an informed decision.

**What sizes are available for Meowdy shirts?**
Meowdy shirts are typically available in a wide range of sizes, from small (S) to extra-large (XL), and sometimes up to 5XL, depending on the brand. Always check the specific sizing chart provided by the manufacturer to ensure an accurate fit. Sizing can vary slightly between different brands, so it's important to compare your measurements to the chart before ordering.

**How should I care for my Meowdy shirt to ensure it lasts?**
To keep your Meowdy shirt looking its best, it's recommended to wash it inside out in cold water. Use a mild detergent and avoid bleach or fabric softeners, as these can damage the print and fade the color. Tumble dry on low heat or hang it to dry.

You can also find unique designs on the websites of specific clothing brands or through social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest.

Look for shirts with a unisex fit or designs that are gender-neutral. Ultimately, the best Meowdy shirt for you is the one that you feel most comfortable and confident wearing.

I need some outside perspective on this situation with my roommate because I'm starting to feel like the crazy one.

I'm 22F and live with my roommate Chloe who's also 22. We've been living together for about 8 months and split rent 50/50. When we first moved in together she seemed pretty normal and we got along fine.

But for the past 2 months she's been bringing home different guys literally every single night. I'm not exaggerating, it's been every night for like 6 weeks straight. Sometimes she'll have the same guy for a few days but usually its someone new.

The problem is our walls are thin and I can hear everything. I've had to sleep with earplugs and white noise just to get some rest. I work early shifts so I need to be asleep by 10pm but they're usually still going at it past midnight.

I tried talking to her about it and she said I was being prudish and that she's just ""exploring her sexuality."" She told me if I don't like it I can find somewhere else to live. But I can't afford to break the lease and I was here first.

Yesterday morning I came out to the kitchen and there was some random guy making coffee in his underwear. I shouldn't have to see strange men in their underwear in my own home. I'm starting to think she's doing this on purpose to get me to move out.",2,1752311080.0,TwoHotTakes,5,1.0,False

Okay so I 18 F (genderfluid) went on my senior trip with my school on May 13 and came back on May 15. I‚Äôm being loose with the information because I graduated May 29th 2025 and honestly don‚Äôt care anymore. On day one we got there at the bus stop at 3am all was good me and my friends were excited and happy. We get on the bus and I wanted to sit with my friend will call her Tammy. Before I could sit with Tammy Alexa sat down next to her. Me and Tammy said it‚Äôs whatever because Alexa is our best friend. Day one is fine other than the short waits at universal studios and Alexa refusing to redo a few fun rides and threatening to move on to the next ride without me or Tammy. 

Now here‚Äôs where things started to really go south. By morning I got up super early I‚Äôm talking 5:30am early. Tammy was cool with it because she wanted to find the perfect outfit for Disney in the morning. While I on the other hand needed to shower before I was on my cycle again. Things were perfect Alexa decided that she wanted to sleep in as she should since out of the three of us she stayed up super late. Probably about 1:00am or 2:00am me and Tammy on the other hand slept fell asleep probably around 12:00am. Regardless we waited to wake her up around 6:40am which would give her 20 minutes to get ready before breakfast time. By the time it was breakfast we showed up late because it took forever to wake up Alexa. By the time we got downstairs we were ready for some food. Alexa had snapped at me and Tammy for multiple reasons. For starters we got up to early even though we discussed that we would be waking up this early multiple times throughout the day before we got to the hotel. Then we didn‚Äôt wake her up early enough even though she said not to wake her up. Then there was us being ready before her and ready to get food without her. Check out was at 7:40am and we all had to be downstairs and ready to go at 7:50 so we could leave at 8:00am. Finally the last reason she snapped at us was because we left our luggage in the room and convinced her to do the same since me and Tammy both thought we would come back to the room after Disney land which we were wrong. Alexa yelled at us over the situation making me and Tammy feel really bad about the situation. Which we know it was a mistake which led us to being even more late to breakfast we had to get staff to get us a card to let us into the room. Alexa with a attitude grabbed her stuff and left while me and Alexa had to scramble together to grab the food that was in fact mostly Alexa‚Äôs and pack pack up what remained of our supplies from the day prior. We made it out around probably 7:45am and got lucky because the teachers went to the bathroom and we‚Äôre taking a super long time the didn‚Äôt leave till around 8:00am to 8:10am.  Me and Tammy got food which Tammy was super happy while I was still stressed out from the morning and struggled to eat a pancake. Alexa‚Äôs excuse for her attitude was that she was hungry and needed her coffee as well. So we brushed it off because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day over such a petty thing. We walked a few blocks to the park which let me calm down. We got food at the Starbucks which was pretty good Tammy tried my food which was the impossible breakfast sandwich and a custom drink from Lemon8 and Tammy was impressed. While Alexa judged my food choice and insulted my impossible breakfast sandwich (I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian but for context back in 2015 to 2016 then 2018 to 2019 my parents became vegetarians so I‚Äôm open to a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and love the breakfast sandwich from Starbucks). 

Now fast forward after several long waits throughout the park Alexa is asks ‚Äúdo we want to have dinner with my boyfriend and his friends?‚Äù Me and Tammy said ‚Äúno‚Äù. For context we aren‚Äôt a fan of one of Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs friends for some stuff he did to my other friend which I won‚Äôt be getting to into at the moment. The rest of his friends we don‚Äôt know or like he‚Äôs friends with a few dirt bags and some don‚Äôt know how to act in public. Think the stereotype of a group of guys in 7th grade but just stuck in the body of 17, 18, and 19 year olds. Gross people who make inappropriate jokes that make others feel uncomfortable while being obnoxious and very loud. Some of them have been kicked out of places because they made people feel uncomfortable or upset. Another way to think of them would be the people who participate in Minecraft movies type of guys. Throwing buckets and bags of popcorn yelling causing a scene dancing but hitting people around them and making messes they won‚Äôt clean up. Overall we weren‚Äôt going anywhere near that chaos. So I explained after everything the guy did that hurt my friend I just don‚Äôt want to be around him because I know I won‚Äôt be able to hold my tongue if he says anything to me. (Off topic he started dating a girl who threatened harm towards me when me and my ex got into a fight. It was so bad I had to get a form of restraining order against her which he knows I was and still am very mad at him. I can‚Äôt be around him.) Alexa didn‚Äôt like my response and made the statement of ‚Äúcommon op please I just want to spend time with my boyfriend if I can make sacrifices for you and your ex when you were 15 then you can make sacrifices for me and my boyfriend and his friends‚Äù. For context the ex she‚Äôs referencing if my abusive ex that I got with when I was 15 and he was almost 18 I don‚Äôt want to get into the details of what happened in this post but when he turned 18 and I was still 15 he became abusive and then wanted me to become a teen mom to his children (I posted on this in the past it was a traumatic experience and I overall don‚Äôt talk about it often now without having a panic attack). Thanks to this I stopped talking for a good 15, 20 minutes just from shock since the topic of my ex was out of nowhere I almost cried I had to pull myself together since I was in public. Honestly I say I did a pretty good job covering how I felt but Tammy checked in on me a lot I went from super chatty and happy to super quiet and distant. Which shoutout to Tammy for being awesome and taking a calmer approach to the situation of comforting me without being over the top. Alexa didn‚Äôt apologize we got on the ride after a few minutes then Alexa ignored the tension and started talking about how we should get on the boat ride to rest and see where it goes which was just in a giant circle. I told Tammy that I need some space because I felt very overwhelmed she understood that and distracted Alexa while I called my girlfriend and told her what happened without crying. She comforted me as best as she could even though she all the way in New Mexico while I‚Äôm in Disney land we hung up and I realize I was being selfish by feeling how I felt. So I sucked it up and tried my best to go back to how I felt. We went to a gift shop so I can buy a plushie but I started to actually feel unwell. It was in the 70 something degrees I felt nauseous and lightheaded (I‚Äôm low on iron and bleeding a lot walking in the heat with a sweater on) and had to sit down. Everyone was getting so I took us to downtown Disney for lunch. 

By the time I got us to Splitsville Alexa was mad because it would cost us a lot of money that we didn‚Äôt have. When I told them they don‚Äôt charge too much and a good amount for the three of us. When Alexa got mad at me and I suggested we go to California adventure and look for something there she refused. In Alexa‚Äôs own words she said ‚Äúthey charge us for being inside the restaurant and we have to order other wise we will get charged for stopping by at any other shop or restaurant.‚Äù I was very confused.  She wouldn‚Äôt elaborate no matter how much I asked. So we sat down and she gave both me and Tammy the silent treatment. Tammy on the other hand was nervous she thought we would pay around 100$ or 200$ on the food and entry fee. I love Tammy being that she‚Äôs my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt go to many restaurants compared to me or Alexa. She didn‚Äôt know if I was right or she was right but she was stressed out because she didn‚Äôt have more than 12$. I told her multiple times I‚Äôll pay for her portions but she was very nervous. Tammy was so scared she ordered a water so the bill won‚Äôt go up be to much. Me Tammy and Alexa got a cheese pizza and chicken fingers with I think a Dr Pepper and root beer with a water. Our total bill about 53$. Alexa kept looking for an entry fee saying it‚Äôs only this high because our entry fee. When I broke down the cost she was shocked. We left with our pockets still full and our stomach fuller. 

We had hopper passes so we moved to California adventure. We got there and Tammy wanted to do the guardians of the galaxy ride. Alexa was terrified and in the process got in line and out of line multiple times eventually she chose to not get in line. We waited in line for two hours. Within the two hours me and Tammy talked about the situations throughout the day Tammy was mad at Alexa for how she acted in the morning then what she said. By the time Tammy came back in line I needed to make a quick call to Amazon over an issue with a package that didn‚Äôt come on time. Yes I called Amazon at Disney in a super long line it was just to get a boring task out the way in a super long boring line. Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them. For lack of better words me and Tammy said ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù (side note look up a video of California adventures giant Ferris wheel it is actually terrifying especially how some of the carts slide and rock) we didn‚Äôt want to 3rd and 4th wheel their date. Something to take note of where not supposed to split from our group by doing so if we‚Äôre caught we will face serious consequences once where back at school. They also made the plans that if me and Tammy won‚Äôt go to dinner with Alexa and boyfriend she‚Äôll go regardless. They went to the Spider-Man ride I was annoyed so I went to tell my girlfriend again what happened. Which shoutout to my girlfriend for being so supportive and caring during that day listening to my rants on Alexa. It took them a while to get in and out which like I warned them multiple times the ride broke down on them Alexa ditched me and Tammy to hang out with her boyfriend after. Long story short me and Tammy had a great time five hours. We got boba from San Fran, Tokyo.and Tammy got to try clam chowder bowls for the first time which she‚Äôs in love with. (Off topic bread bowls besties forever need to be a shirt she loves them so much and so do I) now this is finally part that is the main reason for this post. 

As I said it‚Äôs been five hours since we heard from Alexa. It‚Äôs time to go and Tammy and I have to find her. Not just that we‚Äôre at the meeting place and couldn‚Äôt find anyone there. We called Alexa and she immediately hung up on us(side note there‚Äôs a app we were supposed to download to get updates on where we‚Äôre supposed to go Tammy is a android user and Alexa is iOS user). I didn‚Äôt have the app because we weren‚Äôt supposed to split up at all Tammy and Alexa had the app. I now know how stupid that was. Tammy‚Äôs phone was at 2% and we tried to find the meeting spot. Alexa texted the group chat and said ‚Äústop calling I‚Äôm at 25% and I need my phone we can talk on the bus‚Äù we texted saying it‚Äôs an emergency. We thought the bus got the students early because none of our classmates were around and we didn‚Äôt see our bus either. Turns out you need special permission to bring a bus to Disneyland so we had to walk to the bus about 3 miles out. The group thankfully didn‚Äôt leave yet everyone just shifted to Disneyland for the firework show. After spam calling Alexa here‚Äôs the main interaction once answer after 10 calls.

Heres a recap of the call:
Alexa: What do you want you‚Äôre killing my phone battery.
Tammy: Dude where are you me and op are lost and were freaking out did the school leave Disney.
Alexa: No where all here by the fountain.
Tammy: Cool which fountain and by what shop there‚Äôs a lot of fountains.
Alexa: The fountain on the way to the place we had lunch at.
Tammy: op said there‚Äôs a bunch of fountains Alexa where are you close by so we can head towards that location.
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Oh my f***ing gosh your friends are so (he calls us the R slur).
Alexa: you‚Äôll see it once you‚Äôre close by. 
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Tell them to use the f***ing app.
Tammy: My phone is at 2% nothing is loading I‚Äôm calling from OP‚Äôs phone.
Alexa: Just start walking when I see you I‚Äôll let you know.

I don‚Äôt recall the rest of the call other than Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend calling us the R slur and cursing at us. Alexa didn‚Äôt stop her boyfriend at all and eventually said to call her boyfriend for instructions to find the place. Me and Tammy walked almost to the monorails in downtown Disney and saw no one we had to walk back to the gates and still saw no one. It was 11pm I‚Äôm about to cry because me and Tammy are lost we don‚Äôt see anyone we recognize were getting called the R slur and cursed out by our friends boyfriend it‚Äôs late my feet hurt I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm feeling sharp pains in my legs (I have issues with my feet so if I‚Äôm on them for too long I feel sharp pain in my feet and legs I had been on them for two hours at that point with no breaks and a total of three four hours). Tammy saw my eyes start watering and started yelling and cursing at both Alexa and Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend. Their response, hang up on us. Tammy hugged me and comforted me because the whole day overall had been a drag. We got lucky and found a teacher from our school and followed him turns out they moved the first meeting spot to this random hidden corner. We later go to the main meeting spot around 11:30pm. By the time Alexa reached out to us which was 11:40 she sent the text of a shitty photo of where we later meet at to Tammy‚Äôs phone. After all this I‚Äôm thinking about going no contact with my bestie.

Okay so I 18 F (genderfluid) went on my senior trip with my school on May 13 and came back on May 15. I‚Äôm being loose with the information because I graduated May 29th 2025 and honestly don‚Äôt care anymore. On day one we got there at the bus stop at 3am all was good me and my friends were excited and happy. We get on the bus and I wanted to sit with my friend will call her Tammy. Before I could sit with Tammy Alexa sat down next to her. Me and Tammy said it‚Äôs whatever because Alexa is our best friend. Day one is fine other than the short waits at universal studios and Alexa refusing to redo a few fun rides and threatening to move on to the next ride without me or Tammy. 

Now here‚Äôs where things started to really go south. By morning I got up super early I‚Äôm talking 5:30am early. Tammy was cool with it because she wanted to find the perfect outfit for Disney in the morning. While I on the other hand needed to shower before I was on my cycle again. Things were perfect Alexa decided that she wanted to sleep in as she should since out of the three of us she stayed up super late. Probably about 1:00am or 2:00am me and Tammy on the other hand slept fell asleep probably around 12:00am. Regardless we waited to wake her up around 6:40am which would give her 20 minutes to get ready before breakfast time. By the time it was breakfast we showed up late because it took forever to wake up Alexa. By the time we got downstairs we were ready for some food. Alexa had snapped at me and Tammy for multiple reasons. For starters we got up to early even though we discussed that we would be waking up this early multiple times throughout the day before we got to the hotel. Then we didn‚Äôt wake her up early enough even though she said not to wake her up. Then there was us being ready before her and ready to get food without her. Check out was at 7:40am and we all had to be downstairs and ready to go at 7:50 so we could leave at 8:00am. Finally the last reason she snapped at us was because we left our luggage in the room and convinced her to do the same since me and Tammy both thought we would come back to the room after Disney land which we were wrong. Alexa yelled at us over the situation making me and Tammy feel really bad about the situation. Which we know it was a mistake which led us to being even more late to breakfast we had to get staff to get us a card to let us into the room. Alexa with a attitude grabbed her stuff and left while me and Alexa had to scramble together to grab the food that was in fact mostly Alexa‚Äôs and pack pack up what remained of our supplies from the day prior. We made it out around probably 7:45am and got lucky because the teachers went to the bathroom and we‚Äôre taking a super long time the didn‚Äôt leave till around 8:00am to 8:10am.  Me and Tammy got food which Tammy was super happy while I was still stressed out from the morning and struggled to eat a pancake. Alexa‚Äôs excuse for her attitude was that she was hungry and needed her coffee as well. So we brushed it off because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day over such a petty thing. We walked a few blocks to the park which let me calm down. We got food at the Starbucks which was pretty good Tammy tried my food which was the impossible breakfast sandwich and a custom drink from Lemon8 and Tammy was impressed. While Alexa judged my food choice and insulted my impossible breakfast sandwich (I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian but for context back in 2015 to 2016 then 2018 to 2019 my parents became vegetarians so I‚Äôm open to a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and love the breakfast sandwich from Starbucks). 

Now fast forward after several long waits throughout the park Alexa is asks ‚Äúdo we want to have dinner with my boyfriend and his friends?‚Äù Me and Tammy said ‚Äúno‚Äù. For context we aren‚Äôt a fan of one of Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs friends for some stuff he did to my other friend which I won‚Äôt be getting to into at the moment. The rest of his friends we don‚Äôt know or like he‚Äôs friends with a few dirt bags and some don‚Äôt know how to act in public. Think the stereotype of a group of guys in 7th grade but just stuck in the body of 17, 18, and 19 year olds. Gross people who make inappropriate jokes that make others feel uncomfortable while being obnoxious and very loud. Some of them have been kicked out of places because they made people feel uncomfortable or upset. Another way to think of them would be the people who participate in Minecraft movies type of guys. Throwing buckets and bags of popcorn yelling causing a scene dancing but hitting people around them and making messes they won‚Äôt clean up. Overall we weren‚Äôt going anywhere near that chaos. So I explained after everything the guy did that hurt my friend I just don‚Äôt want to be around him because I know I won‚Äôt be able to hold my tongue if he says anything to me. (Off topic he started dating a girl who threatened harm towards me when me and my ex got into a fight. It was so bad I had to get a form of restraining order against her which he knows I was and still am very mad at him. I can‚Äôt be around him.) Alexa didn‚Äôt like my response and made the statement of ‚Äúcommon op please I just want to spend time with my boyfriend if I can make sacrifices for you and your ex when you were 15 then you can make sacrifices for me and my boyfriend and his friends‚Äù. For context the ex she‚Äôs referencing if my abusive ex that I got with when I was 15 and he was almost 18 I don‚Äôt want to get into the details of what happened in this post but when he turned 18 and I was still 15 he became abusive and then wanted me to become a teen mom to his children (I posted on this in the past it was a traumatic experience and I overall don‚Äôt talk about it often now without having a panic attack). Thanks to this I stopped talking for a good 15, 20 minutes just from shock since the topic of my ex was out of nowhere I almost cried I had to pull myself together since I was in public. Honestly I say I did a pretty good job covering how I felt but Tammy checked in on me a lot I went from super chatty and happy to super quiet and distant. Which shoutout to Tammy for being awesome and taking a calmer approach to the situation of comforting me without being over the top. Alexa didn‚Äôt apologize we got on the ride after a few minutes then Alexa ignored the tension and started talking about how we should get on the boat ride to rest and see where it goes which was just in a giant circle. I told Tammy that I need some space because I felt very overwhelmed she understood that and distracted Alexa while I called my girlfriend and told her what happened without crying. She comforted me as best as she could even though she all the way in New Mexico while I‚Äôm in Disney land we hung up and I realize I was being selfish by feeling how I felt. So I sucked it up and tried my best to go back to how I felt. We went to a gift shop so I can buy a plushie but I started to actually feel unwell. It was in the 70 something degrees I felt nauseous and lightheaded (I‚Äôm low on iron and bleeding a lot walking in the heat with a sweater on) and had to sit down. Everyone was getting so I took us to downtown Disney for lunch. 

By the time I got us to Splitsville Alexa was mad because it would cost us a lot of money that we didn‚Äôt have. When I told them they don‚Äôt charge too much and a good amount for the three of us. When Alexa got mad at me and I suggested we go to California adventure and look for something there she refused. In Alexa‚Äôs own words she said ‚Äúthey charge us for being inside the restaurant and we have to order other wise we will get charged for stopping by at any other shop or restaurant.‚Äù I was very confused.  She wouldn‚Äôt elaborate no matter how much I asked. So we sat down and she gave both me and Tammy the silent treatment. Tammy on the other hand was nervous she thought we would pay around 100$ or 200$ on the food and entry fee. I love Tammy being that she‚Äôs my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt go to many restaurants compared to me or Alexa. She didn‚Äôt know if I was right or she was right but she was stressed out because she didn‚Äôt have more than 12$. I told her multiple times I‚Äôll pay for her portions but she was very nervous. Tammy was so scared she ordered a water so the bill won‚Äôt go up be to much. Me Tammy and Alexa got a cheese pizza and chicken fingers with I think a Dr Pepper and root beer with a water. Our total bill about 53$. Alexa kept looking for an entry fee saying it‚Äôs only this high because our entry fee. When I broke down the cost she was shocked. We left with our pockets still full and our stomach fuller. 

We had hopper passes so we moved to California adventure. We got there and Tammy wanted to do the guardians of the galaxy ride. Alexa was terrified and in the process got in line and out of line multiple times eventually she chose to not get in line. We waited in line for two hours. Within the two hours me and Tammy talked about the situations throughout the day Tammy was mad at Alexa for how she acted in the morning then what she said. By the time Tammy came back in line I needed to make a quick call to Amazon over an issue with a package that didn‚Äôt come on time. Yes I called Amazon at Disney in a super long line it was just to get a boring task out the way in a super long boring line. Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them.

For anyone not familiar with Astoria, some of the things that I love about it and would like to find in LA:

\- Amazing community feel. Like, I really can't stress this one enough, this is the first place I've ever lived where neighbors all know each other. You walk into the coffee shop or the bar and you're friends with everyone there. The community is super engaged, lots of locally organized events and community groups, it's so social.

\- Very walkable - I know it might be a stretch to find a good walkable area in LA

\- Lots of genuine creatives and academics. I don't mean the NYU kids whose parents pay their rent (they're all in Brooklyn), in Astoria, you've got a bunch of musicians, artists, journalists, etc, who are just really genuinely trying their best to make it in New York.

\- Amazing food. Queens' slogan is 'The World's Borough'. There's food from all over the world, and it's all so good.

If anyone has some good LA neighborhood recs that fit some of these, let me know! Also, feel free to let me know where I should absolutely avoid.",0,1752310854.0,AskLosAngeles,6,0.4,False

Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them. For lack of better words me and Tammy said ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù (side note look up a video of California adventures giant Ferris wheel it is actually terrifying especially how some of the carts slide and rock) we didn‚Äôt want to 3rd and 4th wheel their date. Something to take note of where not supposed to split from our group by doing so if we‚Äôre caught we will face serious consequences once where back at school. They also made the plans that if me and Tammy won‚Äôt go to dinner with Alexa and boyfriend she‚Äôll go regardless. They went to the Spider-Man ride I was annoyed so I went to tell my girlfriend again what happened. Which shoutout to my girlfriend for being so supportive and caring during that day listening to my rants on Alexa. It took them a while to get in and out which like I warned them multiple times the ride broke down on them Alexa ditched me and Tammy to hang out with her boyfriend after. Long story short me and Tammy had a great time five hours. We got boba from San Fran, Tokyo.and Tammy got to try clam chowder bowls for the first time which she‚Äôs in love with. (Off topic bread bowls besties forever need to be a shirt she loves them so much and so do I) now this is finally part that is the main reason for this post. 

As I said it‚Äôs been five hours since we heard from Alexa. It‚Äôs time to go and Tammy and I have to find her. Not just that we‚Äôre at the meeting place and couldn‚Äôt find anyone there. We called Alexa and she immediately hung up on us(side note there‚Äôs a app we were supposed to download to get updates on where we‚Äôre supposed to go Tammy is a android user and Alexa is iOS user). I didn‚Äôt have the app because we weren‚Äôt supposed to split up at all Tammy and Alexa had the app. I now know how stupid that was. Tammy‚Äôs phone was at 2% and we tried to find the meeting spot. Alexa texted the group chat and said ‚Äústop calling I‚Äôm at 25% and I need my phone we can talk on the bus‚Äù we texted saying it‚Äôs an emergency. We thought the bus got the students early because none of our classmates were around and we didn‚Äôt see our bus either. Turns out you need special permission to bring a bus to Disneyland so we had to walk to the bus about 3 miles out. The group thankfully didn‚Äôt leave yet everyone just shifted to Disneyland for the firework show. After spam calling Alexa here‚Äôs the main interaction once answer after 10 calls.

Heres a recap of the call:
Alexa: What do you want you‚Äôre killing my phone battery.
Tammy: Dude where are you me and op are lost and were freaking out did the school leave Disney.
Alexa: No where all here by the fountain.
Tammy: Cool which fountain and by what shop there‚Äôs a lot of fountains.
Alexa: The fountain on the way to the place we had lunch at.
Tammy: op said there‚Äôs a bunch of fountains Alexa where are you close by so we can head towards that location.
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Oh my f***ing gosh your friends are so (he calls us the R slur).
Alexa: you‚Äôll see it once you‚Äôre close by. 
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Tell them to use the f***ing app.
Tammy: My phone is at 2% nothing is loading I‚Äôm calling from OP‚Äôs phone.
Alexa: Just start walking when I see you I‚Äôll let you know.

I don‚Äôt recall the rest of the call other than Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend calling us the R slur and cursing at us. Alexa didn‚Äôt stop her boyfriend at all and eventually said to call her boyfriend for instructions to find the place. Me and Tammy walked almost to the monorails in downtown Disney and saw no one we had to walk back to the gates and still saw no one. It was 11pm I‚Äôm about to cry because me and Tammy are lost we don‚Äôt see anyone we recognize were getting called the R slur and cursed out by our friends boyfriend it‚Äôs late my feet hurt I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm feeling sharp pains in my legs (I have issues with my feet so if I‚Äôm on them for too long I feel sharp pain in my feet and legs I had been on them for two hours at that point with no breaks and a total of three four hours). Tammy saw my eyes start watering and started yelling and cursing at both Alexa and Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend. Their response, hang up on us. Tammy hugged me and comforted me because the whole day overall had been a drag. We got lucky and found a teacher from our school and followed him turns out they moved the first meeting spot to this random hidden corner. We later go to the main meeting spot around 11:30pm. By the time Alexa reached out to us which was 11:40 she sent the text of a shitty photo of where we later meet at to Tammy‚Äôs phone. After all this I‚Äôm thinking about going no contact with my bestie.

When I grind for a double shot (using double basket, around 18‚ÄØg coffee), the machine recommends using the double cup button. But when I do this, I get about 55‚ÄØg espresso. So this is like a 1:3 ratio, not the 1:2 ratio I expected.

If I press the single cup button (still using double basket), it seems to stop around 36‚ÄØg, which is closer to 1:2 ratio.

Did anyone else notice this? Do you also use the single cup button with double basket for 1:2? I adjust the grind size when switching between single and double.",1,1752310774.0,BrevilleCoffee,1,1.0,False

Okay so I 18 F (genderfluid) went on my senior trip with my school on May 13 and came back on May 15. I‚Äôm being loose with the information because I graduated May 29th 2025 and honestly don‚Äôt care anymore. On day one we got there at the bus stop at 3am all was good me and my friends were excited and happy. We get on the bus and I wanted to sit with my friend will call her Tammy. Before I could sit with Tammy Alexa sat down next to her. Me and Tammy said it‚Äôs whatever because Alexa is our best friend. Day one is fine other than the short waits at universal studios and Alexa refusing to redo a few fun rides and threatening to move on to the next ride without me or Tammy. 

Now here‚Äôs where things started to really go south. By morning I got up super early I‚Äôm talking 5:30am early. Tammy was cool with it because she wanted to find the perfect outfit for Disney in the morning. While I on the other hand needed to shower before I was on my cycle again. Things were perfect Alexa decided that she wanted to sleep in as she should since out of the three of us she stayed up super late. Probably about 1:00am or 2:00am me and Tammy on the other hand slept fell asleep probably around 12:00am. Regardless we waited to wake her up around 6:40am which would give her 20 minutes to get ready before breakfast time. By the time it was breakfast we showed up late because it took forever to wake up Alexa. By the time we got downstairs we were ready for some food. Alexa had snapped at me and Tammy for multiple reasons. For starters we got up to early even though we discussed that we would be waking up this early multiple times throughout the day before we got to the hotel. Then we didn‚Äôt wake her up early enough even though she said not to wake her up. Then there was us being ready before her and ready to get food without her. Check out was at 7:40am and we all had to be downstairs and ready to go at 7:50 so we could leave at 8:00am. Finally the last reason she snapped at us was because we left our luggage in the room and convinced her to do the same since me and Tammy both thought we would come back to the room after Disney land which we were wrong. Alexa yelled at us over the situation making me and Tammy feel really bad about the situation. Which we know it was a mistake which led us to being even more late to breakfast we had to get staff to get us a card to let us into the room. Alexa with a attitude grabbed her stuff and left while me and Alexa had to scramble together to grab the food that was in fact mostly Alexa‚Äôs and pack pack up what remained of our supplies from the day prior. We made it out around probably 7:45am and got lucky because the teachers went to the bathroom and we‚Äôre taking a super long time the didn‚Äôt leave till around 8:00am to 8:10am.  Me and Tammy got food which Tammy was super happy while I was still stressed out from the morning and struggled to eat a pancake. Alexa‚Äôs excuse for her attitude was that she was hungry and needed her coffee as well. So we brushed it off because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day over such a petty thing. We walked a few blocks to the park which let me calm down. We got food at the Starbucks which was pretty good Tammy tried my food which was the impossible breakfast sandwich and a custom drink from Lemon8 and Tammy was impressed. While Alexa judged my food choice and insulted my impossible breakfast sandwich (I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian but for context back in 2015 to 2016 then 2018 to 2019 my parents became vegetarians so I‚Äôm open to a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and love the breakfast sandwich from Starbucks). 

Now fast forward after several long waits throughout the park Alexa is asks ‚Äúdo we want to have dinner with my boyfriend and his friends?‚Äù Me and Tammy said ‚Äúno‚Äù. For context we aren‚Äôt a fan of one of Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs friends for some stuff he did to my other friend which I won‚Äôt be getting to into at the moment. The rest of his friends we don‚Äôt know or like he‚Äôs friends with a few dirt bags and some don‚Äôt know how to act in public. Think the stereotype of a group of guys in 7th grade but just stuck in the body of 17, 18, and 19 year olds. Gross people who make inappropriate jokes that make others feel uncomfortable while being obnoxious and very loud. Some of them have been kicked out of places because they made people feel uncomfortable or upset. Another way to think of them would be the people who participate in Minecraft movies type of guys. Throwing buckets and bags of popcorn yelling causing a scene dancing but hitting people around them and making messes they won‚Äôt clean up. Overall we weren‚Äôt going anywhere near that chaos. So I explained after everything the guy did that hurt my friend I just don‚Äôt want to be around him because I know I won‚Äôt be able to hold my tongue if he says anything to me. (Off topic he started dating a girl who threatened harm towards me when me and my ex got into a fight. It was so bad I had to get a form of restraining order against her which he knows I was and still am very mad at him. I can‚Äôt be around him.) Alexa didn‚Äôt like my response and made the statement of ‚Äúcommon op please I just want to spend time with my boyfriend if I can make sacrifices for you and your ex when you were 15 then you can make sacrifices for me and my boyfriend and his friends‚Äù. For context the ex she‚Äôs referencing if my abusive ex that I got with when I was 15 and he was almost 18 I don‚Äôt want to get into the details of what happened in this post but when he turned 18 and I was still 15 he became abusive and then wanted me to become a teen mom to his children (I posted on this in the past it was a traumatic experience and I overall don‚Äôt talk about it often now without having a panic attack). Thanks to this I stopped talking for a good 15, 20 minutes just from shock since the topic of my ex was out of nowhere I almost cried I had to pull myself together since I was in public. Honestly I say I did a pretty good job covering how I felt but Tammy checked in on me a lot I went from super chatty and happy to super quiet and distant. Which shoutout to Tammy for being awesome and taking a calmer approach to the situation of comforting me without being over the top. Alexa didn‚Äôt apologize we got on the ride after a few minutes then Alexa ignored the tension and started talking about how we should get on the boat ride to rest and see where it goes which was just in a giant circle. I told Tammy that I need some space because I felt very overwhelmed she understood that and distracted Alexa while I called my girlfriend and told her what happened without crying. She comforted me as best as she could even though she all the way in New Mexico while I‚Äôm in Disney land we hung up and I realize I was being selfish by feeling how I felt. So I sucked it up and tried my best to go back to how I felt. We went to a gift shop so I can buy a plushie but I started to actually feel unwell. It was in the 70 something degrees I felt nauseous and lightheaded (I‚Äôm low on iron and bleeding a lot walking in the heat with a sweater on) and had to sit down. Everyone was getting so I took us to downtown Disney for lunch. 

By the time I got us to Splitsville Alexa was mad because it would cost us a lot of money that we didn‚Äôt have. When I told them they don‚Äôt charge too much and a good amount for the three of us. When Alexa got mad at me and I suggested we go to California adventure and look for something there she refused. In Alexa‚Äôs own words she said ‚Äúthey charge us for being inside the restaurant and we have to order other wise we will get charged for stopping by at any other shop or restaurant.‚Äù I was very confused.  She wouldn‚Äôt elaborate no matter how much I asked. So we sat down and she gave both me and Tammy the silent treatment. Tammy on the other hand was nervous she thought we would pay around 100$ or 200$ on the food and entry fee. I love Tammy being that she‚Äôs my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt go to many restaurants compared to me or Alexa. She didn‚Äôt know if I was right or she was right but she was stressed out because she didn‚Äôt have more than 12$. I told her multiple times I‚Äôll pay for her portions but she was very nervous. Tammy was so scared she ordered a water so the bill won‚Äôt go up be to much. Me Tammy and Alexa got a cheese pizza and chicken fingers with I think a Dr Pepper and root beer with a water. Our total bill about 53$. Alexa kept looking for an entry fee saying it‚Äôs only this high because our entry fee. When I broke down the cost she was shocked. We left with our pockets still full and our stomach fuller. 

We had hopper passes so we moved to California adventure. We got there and Tammy wanted to do the guardians of the galaxy ride. Alexa was terrified and in the process got in line and out of line multiple times eventually she chose to not get in line. We waited in line for two hours. Within the two hours me and Tammy talked about the situations throughout the day Tammy was mad at Alexa for how she acted in the morning then what she said. By the time Tammy came back in line I needed to make a quick call to Amazon over an issue with a package that didn‚Äôt come on time. Yes I called Amazon at Disney in a super long line it was just to get a boring task out the way in a super long boring line. Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them. For lack of better words me and Tammy said ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù (side note look up a video of California adventures giant Ferris wheel it is actually terrifying especially how some of the carts slide and rock) we didn‚Äôt want to 3rd and 4th wheel their date. Something to take note of where not supposed to split from our group by doing so if we‚Äôre caught we will face serious consequences once where back at school.

I was taking Tirz for a few months and lost some weight. I was micro-dosing (1.5mg) because I was a super responder. Loved that I could finally lose weight and remove the food noise. 

Here is what happened: 
- I would get brain fog and fatigue every afternoon. My work requires a lot of thinking (I do research) and I just feel like my brain cannot put 2 and 2 together.
- Decided to stop it. It‚Äôs been much better, but after 2 weeks, I still feel ‚Äúweird‚Äù and I have to drink even more coffee to push my brain to wake up. I cried today because I got scared my brain and mental abilities might never come back.

I did blood tests and other than Vitamin D deficiency (which I always had), there is nothing wrong (thyroid and B12 are good). 

- Do you think it messed me up long term? 
- How am I gonna get back on it and lose weight‚Ä¶ Is this happening with semaglutide too? What about the official brand?

My theory and based on some research, is that it decreases dopamine in the brain, which causes all these feelings i‚Äôve been having. Wondering if I should ask my doctor for Wellbutrin to compensate and take tirz again.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Step One: Charge ‚Çπ1000‚Äì‚Çπ1600 for IMAX tickets
So that two tickets cost the same as a year of Netflix.
When demand is high, loot them.
When demand is low‚Ä¶ loot them anyway.

FY24 average occupancy? Barely 26%.
(Source: PVR INOX Investor Presentation, 2024)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Step Two: Be distributor and exhibitor
PVR pictures distributes movies, PVR Cinemas  screens them.
Guess whose films get better shows?
Even when the public doesn‚Äôt care, screens run half empty but hey, control > cinema.

[Business Standard, 2023]:

‚ÄúWe will get better control on show timings.‚Äù
Exactly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Step Three: Ignore real cinema
Film actually shot for IMAX (e.g., #Sinners)?
Skip it, and instead run random Bollywood flicks on Priya, Paras & Eros IMAX.
Because why give fans what they came for?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Step Four: Launch a fan-friendly plan, then kill it
Passport: ‚Çπ349 for 4 weekday movies (extra ‚Çπ150 for IMAX, ICE, 4DX, P[XL], BigPix).
When fans started coming:
‚ùå Block new releases
‚ùå Blackout dates
‚ùå Front rows only
Result: fans feel tricked, stop coming. Mission accomplished.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Step Five: Sell F&B like it‚Äôs caviar
Single coffee? ‚Çπ360.
Medium popcorn? ‚Çπ490.
It‚Äôs not even Starbucks.
Total family bill = two months of OTT + dinner at a real restaurant.
And then they wonder why families don‚Äôt come back.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Step Six: Show more ads than trailers
Want to see upcoming movie trailers? Too bad.
Here, enjoy 20+ minutes of jewellery, insurance & washing powder ads.
Because yes, that‚Äôs what cinephiles pay ‚Çπ1600 for.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Step Seven: Let screens rot
Koramangala IMAX‚Äôs faded bulb?
Select City Walk screens that look dim?
P[XL] that feels like regular theatre eg Kochi P[XL]?
Maintenance budget must be going somewhere else.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Step Eight: Blame everything except yourself
Every investor call: ‚ÄúBollywood underperformed.‚Äù

Not a word on sky-high tickets, tired programming, neglected screens, or alienating loyal fans.

üìä By the numbers (FY24):
‚Ä¢‚Çπ6,000 Cr+ revenue
‚Ä¢‚Çπ125 Cr total loss
‚Ä¢Ticket prices up, footfalls flat
(Source: Mint & PVR INOX filings)

üé¨ Result:
Audiences say: ‚ÄúSkip theatres, wait for OTT.‚Äù
Occupancy drops. Fans leave.
PVR: ‚ÄúBut why??‚Äù

Conclusion: Movie watching which was once the Indian common man‚Äôs way to enjoy, has now turned into the elite‚Äôs way to enjoy while a common man barely can afford anything and ends up preferring family time watching a movie on OTT instead. Not because he doesn‚Äôt wanna have a good time at cinema, but because prices are going out his hands now.",12,1752310264.0,IndianCinema,4,1.0,False

Finally the last reason she snapped at us was because we left our luggage in the room and convinced her to do the same since me and Tammy both thought we would come back to the room after Disney land which we were wrong. Alexa yelled at us over the situation making me and Tammy feel really bad about the situation. Which we know it was a mistake which led us to being even more late to breakfast we had to get staff to get us a card to let us into the room. Alexa with a attitude grabbed her stuff and left while me and Alexa had to scramble together to grab the food that was in fact mostly Alexa‚Äôs and pack pack up what remained of our supplies from the day prior. We made it out around probably 7:45am and got lucky because the teachers went to the bathroom and we‚Äôre taking a super long time the didn‚Äôt leave till around 8:00am to 8:10am.  Me and Tammy got food which Tammy was super happy while I was still stressed out from the morning and struggled to eat a pancake. Alexa‚Äôs excuse for her attitude was that she was hungry and needed her coffee as well. So we brushed it off because we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day over such a petty thing. We walked a few blocks to the park which let me calm down. We got food at the Starbucks which was pretty good Tammy tried my food which was the impossible breakfast sandwich and a custom drink from Lemon8 and Tammy was impressed. While Alexa judged my food choice and insulted my impossible breakfast sandwich (I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian but for context back in 2015 to 2016 then 2018 to 2019 my parents became vegetarians so I‚Äôm open to a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and love the breakfast sandwich from Starbucks). 

Now fast forward after several long waits throughout the park Alexa is asks ‚Äúdo we want to have dinner with my boyfriend and his friends?‚Äù Me and Tammy said ‚Äúno‚Äù. For context we aren‚Äôt a fan of one of Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs friends for some stuff he did to my other friend which I won‚Äôt be getting to into at the moment. The rest of his friends we don‚Äôt know or like he‚Äôs friends with a few dirt bags and some don‚Äôt know how to act in public. Think the stereotype of a group of guys in 7th grade but just stuck in the body of 17, 18, and 19 year olds. Gross people who make inappropriate jokes that make others feel uncomfortable while being obnoxious and very loud. Some of them have been kicked out of places because they made people feel uncomfortable or upset. Another way to think of them would be the people who participate in Minecraft movies type of guys. Throwing buckets and bags of popcorn yelling causing a scene dancing but hitting people around them and making messes they won‚Äôt clean up. Overall we weren‚Äôt going anywhere near that chaos. So I explained after everything the guy did that hurt my friend I just don‚Äôt want to be around him because I know I won‚Äôt be able to hold my tongue if he says anything to me. (Off topic he started dating a girl who threatened harm towards me when me and my ex got into a fight. It was so bad I had to get a form of restraining order against her which he knows I was and still am very mad at him. I can‚Äôt be around him.) Alexa didn‚Äôt like my response and made the statement of ‚Äúcommon op please I just want to spend time with my boyfriend if I can make sacrifices for you and your ex when you were 15 then you can make sacrifices for me and my boyfriend and his friends‚Äù. For context the ex she‚Äôs referencing if my abusive ex that I got with when I was 15 and he was almost 18 I don‚Äôt want to get into the details of what happened in this post but when he turned 18 and I was still 15 he became abusive and then wanted me to become a teen mom to his children (I posted on this in the past it was a traumatic experience and I overall don‚Äôt talk about it often now without having a panic attack). Thanks to this I stopped talking for a good 15, 20 minutes just from shock since the topic of my ex was out of nowhere I almost cried I had to pull myself together since I was in public. Honestly I say I did a pretty good job covering how I felt but Tammy checked in on me a lot I went from super chatty and happy to super quiet and distant. Which shoutout to Tammy for being awesome and taking a calmer approach to the situation of comforting me without being over the top. Alexa didn‚Äôt apologize we got on the ride after a few minutes then Alexa ignored the tension and started talking about how we should get on the boat ride to rest and see where it goes which was just in a giant circle. I told Tammy that I need some space because I felt very overwhelmed she understood that and distracted Alexa while I called my girlfriend and told her what happened without crying. She comforted me as best as she could even though she all the way in New Mexico while I‚Äôm in Disney land we hung up and I realize I was being selfish by feeling how I felt. So I sucked it up and tried my best to go back to how I felt. We went to a gift shop so I can buy a plushie but I started to actually feel unwell. It was in the 70 something degrees I felt nauseous and lightheaded (I‚Äôm low on iron and bleeding a lot walking in the heat with a sweater on) and had to sit down. Everyone was getting so I took us to downtown Disney for lunch. 

By the time I got us to Splitsville Alexa was mad because it would cost us a lot of money that we didn‚Äôt have. When I told them they don‚Äôt charge too much and a good amount for the three of us. When Alexa got mad at me and I suggested we go to California adventure and look for something there she refused. In Alexa‚Äôs own words she said ‚Äúthey charge us for being inside the restaurant and we have to order other wise we will get charged for stopping by at any other shop or restaurant.‚Äù I was very confused.  She wouldn‚Äôt elaborate no matter how much I asked. So we sat down and she gave both me and Tammy the silent treatment. Tammy on the other hand was nervous she thought we would pay around 100$ or 200$ on the food and entry fee. I love Tammy being that she‚Äôs my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt go to many restaurants compared to me or Alexa. She didn‚Äôt know if I was right or she was right but she was stressed out because she didn‚Äôt have more than 12$. I told her multiple times I‚Äôll pay for her portions but she was very nervous. Tammy was so scared she ordered a water so the bill won‚Äôt go up be to much. Me Tammy and Alexa got a cheese pizza and chicken fingers with I think a Dr Pepper and root beer with a water. Our total bill about 53$. Alexa kept looking for an entry fee saying it‚Äôs only this high because our entry fee. When I broke down the cost she was shocked. We left with our pockets still full and our stomach fuller. 

We had hopper passes so we moved to California adventure. We got there and Tammy wanted to do the guardians of the galaxy ride. Alexa was terrified and in the process got in line and out of line multiple times eventually she chose to not get in line. We waited in line for two hours. Within the two hours me and Tammy talked about the situations throughout the day Tammy was mad at Alexa for how she acted in the morning then what she said. By the time Tammy came back in line I needed to make a quick call to Amazon over an issue with a package that didn‚Äôt come on time. Yes I called Amazon at Disney in a super long line it was just to get a boring task out the way in a super long boring line. Within the process of the Amazon call Alexa made fun of the lady who was helping me with the issue mocked her voice and laughed loudly enough to mess with some of the audios. I had to shush Alexa and I kept apologizing to the lady who was understanding. I felt really bad for that lady because Alexa made sure she heard every comment she had about her. Alexa kept making obnoxious comments so I had to cut the call short. She knew that I was talking to Amazon. She thankfully got out of line permanently. 

By the time me and Tammy got out of line after the ride which she was dizzy but so happy we found Alexa. Before we could speak Alexa said at 6:00pm she‚Äôs leaving us to hang out with her boyfriend‚Äôs friends  and have a romantic moment with her boyfriend by going to the ferris wheel and exchanging gifts once they hit the top. We could ‚Äújoin‚Äù her and her boyfriend by going to the cart under them. For lack of better words me and Tammy said ‚ÄúHELL NO‚Äù (side note look up a video of California adventures giant Ferris wheel it is actually terrifying especially how some of the carts slide and rock) we didn‚Äôt want to 3rd and 4th wheel their date. Something to take note of where not supposed to split from our group by doing so if we‚Äôre caught we will face serious consequences once where back at school. They also made the plans that if me and Tammy won‚Äôt go to dinner with Alexa and boyfriend she‚Äôll go regardless. They went to the Spider-Man ride I was annoyed so I went to tell my girlfriend again what happened. Which shoutout to my girlfriend for being so supportive and caring during that day listening to my rants on Alexa. It took them a while to get in and out which like I warned them multiple times the ride broke down on them Alexa ditched me and Tammy to hang out with her boyfriend after. Long story short me and Tammy had a great time five hours. We got boba from San Fran, Tokyo.and Tammy got to try clam chowder bowls for the first time which she‚Äôs in love with. (Off topic bread bowls besties forever need to be a shirt she loves them so much and so do I) now this is finally part that is the main reason for this post. 

As I said it‚Äôs been five hours since we heard from Alexa. It‚Äôs time to go and Tammy and I have to find her. Not just that we‚Äôre at the meeting place and couldn‚Äôt find anyone there. We called Alexa and she immediately hung up on us(side note there‚Äôs a app we were supposed to download to get updates on where we‚Äôre supposed to go Tammy is a android user and Alexa is iOS user). I didn‚Äôt have the app because we weren‚Äôt supposed to split up at all Tammy and Alexa had the app. I now know how stupid that was. Tammy‚Äôs phone was at 2% and we tried to find the meeting spot. Alexa texted the group chat and said ‚Äústop calling I‚Äôm at 25% and I need my phone we can talk on the bus‚Äù we texted saying it‚Äôs an emergency. We thought the bus got the students early because none of our classmates were around and we didn‚Äôt see our bus either. Turns out you need special permission to bring a bus to Disneyland so we had to walk to the bus about 3 miles out. The group thankfully didn‚Äôt leave yet everyone just shifted to Disneyland for the firework show. After spam calling Alexa here‚Äôs the main interaction once answer after 10 calls.

Heres a recap of the call:
Alexa: What do you want you‚Äôre killing my phone battery.
Tammy: Dude where are you me and op are lost and were freaking out did the school leave Disney.
Alexa: No where all here by the fountain.
Tammy: Cool which fountain and by what shop there‚Äôs a lot of fountains.
Alexa: The fountain on the way to the place we had lunch at.
Tammy: op said there‚Äôs a bunch of fountains Alexa where are you close by so we can head towards that location.
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Oh my f***ing gosh your friends are so (he calls us the R slur).
Alexa: you‚Äôll see it once you‚Äôre close by. 
Alexa‚Äôs bf: Tell them to use the f***ing app.
Tammy: My phone is at 2% nothing is loading I‚Äôm calling from OP‚Äôs phone.
Alexa: Just start walking when I see you I‚Äôll let you know.

I don‚Äôt recall the rest of the call other than Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend calling us the R slur and cursing at us. Alexa didn‚Äôt stop her boyfriend at all and eventually said to call her boyfriend for instructions to find the place. Me and Tammy walked almost to the monorails in downtown Disney and saw no one we had to walk back to the gates and still saw no one. It was 11pm I‚Äôm about to cry because me and Tammy are lost we don‚Äôt see anyone we recognize were getting called the R slur and cursed out by our friends boyfriend it‚Äôs late my feet hurt I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm feeling sharp pains in my legs (I have issues with my feet so if I‚Äôm on them for too long I feel sharp pain in my feet and legs I had been on them for two hours at that point with no breaks and a total of three four hours). Tammy saw my eyes start watering and started yelling and cursing at both Alexa and Alexa‚Äôs boyfriend. Their response, hang up on us. Tammy hugged me and comforted me because the whole day overall had been a drag. We got lucky and found a teacher from our school and followed him turns out they moved the first meeting spot to this random hidden corner. We later go to the main meeting spot around 11:30pm. By the time Alexa reached out to us which was 11:40 she sent the text of a shitty photo of where we later meet at to Tammy‚Äôs phone. After all this I‚Äôm thinking about going no contact with my bestie.

I have come today asking for some build advice, I have always made it a point to keep and maintain backup characters for all the games I am in but this character was inspired by a DM implying what his next game is afterwards and they may get used in this game as a backup or the next game. (that would be in about 2 or 3 months) 

Now I will confess I can be a power gamer, I like to build strong characters but I often like to make them very specliased for what they are good at they struggle at most other things.

So what I am looking to make is a character who is focused solely on necrotic damage, the character would have heavy themes off rot and decay, so while I might use a few poison or acid spells necrotic would be the focus.

Now I am unsure what levels we are going to so getting a few build ideas for a games where we go to level 10, 15 and even 20 would be appreciated.

So goals for build

I need to bring the rot, have some high necrotic damage spells to dish out big numbers

A bit of utility alongside some general buffs and debuffs


We roll stats at this table using the 4d6 drop the lowest method. (though we did use the 6d20 method for a April fools one shot) 

15, 16 ,16 10 ,17 ,14 
(of course take it with a grain of salt am in 2 games right now and this is just what I rolled at one table woulld need to roll again at the other one)


So I am happy to make them a pure caster or go for a more marital/ half caster approach

Classes I have been thinking off
Spore Druid with some kind of Ranger or Paladin for a more clean rot knight aesthetic

Or got the caster route with

Undead warlock, Shadow Sorcerer and maybe death domian cleric - though with this route am worried about becoming a Coffee lock

So any ideas on how to improve these or optamise them would be appricated",1,1752310003.0,3d6,3,1.0,False

My diet, sleep patterns, exercise, habits etc have all fallen to the wayside. My peak caffeine consumption was early 2023, where I was subconsciously grabbing an extra coffee here or there to compensate for bad sleep, bad diet, and lack of exercise. 

It‚Äôs been hard for me because I‚Äôve had to address that but I feel like now I‚Äôm finally making real progress on my health. It is not instant or easy, but I do feel some noticeable improvements. 

Caffeine makes it so easy to get away with a bad diet or sleep or lack of exercise because you‚Äôll ‚Äúfeel‚Äù 10/10 on an extra cup but we all know that you eventually adjust and need more and more‚Ä¶

You can‚Äôt make up a shitty diet with an extra cup of coffee. Coffee won‚Äôt compensate for 4 hours of missed sleep. Coffee won‚Äôt improve your stamina or strength, but it‚Äôll make you FEEL stronger as you continue Ie to run yourself down. 

That‚Äôs what happened to me at least. I was super fit 2020-2022 and strictly had usually 1 cup a day, but as I started dabbling in more and compensating my habits got worse and I didn‚Äôt realize just how unhealthy I was becoming. 

Now it‚Äôs time to build real strength, real recovery, and real stamina‚Ä¶",11,1752309815.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1lxvo1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lxvo1c/i_22m_have_feelings_for_my_friend_23f_she_knows/,I (22M) have feelings for my friend (23F) she knows but she's in a relationship,"I (22M) entered college a year ago and a friend who was already ahead by 2 years introduced me to her circle of friends. Within those, there was this really quiet girl (23F) who we'll call Rachel who had been in a relationship with a guy from that group but left him and got into another relationship, a very troublesome one. She had another group of friends who left her because of this relationship, her ex who she was still sort of friends with, berated her for it, and I only heard about her from him.

Fast forward a semester later and I still only heard about her from this one guy because he also got involved with her old group of friends who basically shit talked her non stop. However, for her birthday she brought everyone a piece of her birthday cake... Including me. We had never talked before, despite being in the same group of friends.

I have another group of friends too who also had only heard about her from her ex. My best friend once tried talking to her but felt like she wasn't into it and stopped, we found out from her ex, that she broke down over that. So my greatest take away was ""don't talk to her""... But she brought me cake, and so I started talking to her about it. And it was a small conversation, nothing major.  

But then, I was out in town waiting to meet with some people for a job and remembered her ex telling us that she worked near, so I asked ""Can I pop over?"" and she said yes, so I did. We had a very long chat while she was at work, and we kept on talking, and talking, and talking. I asked her to download Marvel Rivals and now we play every night after class and have long talks up to 5 AM, we keep talking, we hang out so often. I knew about the situation with her boyfriend, and we had a chat about it and I don't understand why they're still together. 

At this point, there's something you must know about me, I catch feelings for people way too often and they have never been reciprocal, not even once. So, I've never been in a relationship and it's not for lack of trying. I'm so unlucky in the selection of people I fall for, because most of them don't like me in that way, don't give the same amount of effort, are shitty people, I find out we're not compatible or, they're gay. And look maybe it's me, I do fuck up a lot in the things I say, like the wrong thing at the wrong time, so maybe that's it. But I'm not an incel, I don't look half bad (I think, I'm not that confident in myself) I'm smart, and a quality that I developed recently, I'm pretty insightful, I'm not that forward, but I am humorous. So I don't lack the quality, but no one seems to appreciate me in that way. I have plenty of friends and people that appreciate me, but none of them do it enough to want to spend that much time with me. 

Now, the group of friends we met through basically shunned us for spending time with her, which should be telling of the quality of people we might be hanging out with. But I do have another group of friends which I trust with my very life. I went out with her these days to a coffee shop and then a concert with that group. I am a pretty physical person but to not make people uncomfortable and risking embarrassing myself, I limit my contact with people. But since that day, she basically gave me the go ahead to get as close to her as I wanted and man, I was euphoric because at that point, I had started developing feelings for her. So there I was, mid concert all up in her business when she and a friend of mine told me that there's a guy that was close to her family and that what we were doing might be misinterpreted, because like I told you before, she has a boyfriend. And well, I got panicked because I didn't want to cause her any trouble. So we started talking about why she let me get that close to her, because I was conflicted in my desire to get close and my respect for her. So at that point, I decided to come clean due to my own inability to reconcile my ambition with the reality of the situation

So yeah, she knows and she hasn't taken a step back from being around me and making me feel cared for which is what most have and would've done. At which point I should say, I have never felt better with someone than I do with her,  she's so wonderful, kind, caring, compassionate, interesting, she has so much heart and layers and things I have in common with her and I love her for it. She's almost one of the best people I've ever met and I'm so grateful to have her in my life. But, since I knew it was a possibility that I would catch feelings, I knew I was going 80mph straight onto a concrete wall. So I think I've hit it and it wasn't as bad, but I know at some point it will start to hurt. 

I don't wanna leave her and she doesn't wanna leave me, she becomes cuter and more open to me by the second, and everything cute she does is like a bullet that makes me feel horrible... But she still, has a boyfriend which, in Spanish there's this word that translates to ""crumb eater"" that's how I feel. So I need advice on what to do. My friends tell me to either love her so much that there might be a chance she could come to me or just tank through it and hope my feelings change but I don't think that will happen and I don't want that to happen because of my selfish desire to be with her.

This is my first time writing on reddit, been a fan of charlotte for years now. Im Jill (31F) from somewhere in the PH, head chef of a small cafe that my boyfriend (32M) owned. We've been running this business for 4 years now and when we started the business, it was just him and me. It was pretty tiring really, until just recently we decided to have the business relocated to a better location. We hired a full set of baristas, cooks, and assistants for the business, everyone was alright, we personally interviewed them being a 2-man team of the cafe, so we checked their personalities and attitude more than their work experience. Note that almost everyone is in the Gen Z age and most of them are newbies, no work experience, or newly graduated. For months everything is going smoothly with the operations with me and my bf supervising and aslo working shifts along with them.

Then came the time we've been hitting high sales, we get surge of customers almost everyday BUT surprisingly we are not profitting. We restock almost everyday, even on days when operations are lean. I did the costing of all our menu items, bf handles the cash flow, we check the costing of our items monthly just to see if the price we set are still profitting‚Äî EVERYTHING IS FINE WITH THE COSTING AND MARGINS.

we brushed the fact that we're losing money, thinking maybe we're still adjusting, maybe its because of research and development for the menu or coffee calibration, or over-scheduling of staff. WE NEVER THOUGHT OF OUR STAFF STEALING FROM US... oh boy, we are wrong.

A newly hired employee told me about their ""staff GC""‚Äî its a group chat of all our employees not including me and my bf. and by told, he sent me all the screenshots he can to prove that all of our staff (including him at first) are eating our stocks, and making their own coffee EVERYDAY. He admitted he made his coffee too because as per one of the cooks, ""it's okay as long as we (the owners) dont catch you"". Again, we are just a small coffee shop and we cant afford to just giveaway our stocks. We already told them during their interview that we cant afford a daily ""free staff meal"" as me and my bf dont eat on our shifts, but IF EVER we have food to share, then it's for everyone. They have an hour break btw, and we pay them higher than the minimum hourly wage for a 7-hr duty and we dont get customers all day, meaning, most of the time we are just resting and waiting for customers to come‚Äî coz in the PH we are already saturated with the third wave of coffee shops on every corner.

I got lots of reasons aside from this but this is just the beginning. And so just last week I terminated all 3 of my cooks and didnt explain to them the context of the enumerated reasons of their termination, not one from these 3 even asked to clarify anything and didnt reply to my email. so AITA for kicking them out without asking them to explain or without me telling them what I know?

PS. I included in their termination letter that they can sched a meeting with us if they wish to clarify the reasons of termination or go into details.",14,1752309362.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.95,False

No one knew that these two polar opposites would entangle in the leather backseat of a Maybach after midnight, locked in desperate passion in the restrooms of The Met Gala.  
  
Or pressed against floor-to-ceiling windows at private Napa Valley estates‚Äîher body trembling as his hands gripped her waist, driving her to the edge of sanity.  
  
After another night of heated hookups, the sound of running water echoed from the bathroom.  
  
Victoria reclined against the headboard, dialing her father's number.  
  
""I'll marry that dying California prince. But I have one condition...""  
  
...  
  
Victoria hung up and was about to get dressed when she spotted Kairos's laptop on the nightstand.  
  
His Instagram were open, and the latest chat was from someone saved as ""Sophia.""  
  
""Kairos, there's thunder outside... I'm so scared...""  
  
Victoria's fingers trembled slightly.  
  
The bathroom door opened and Kairos stepped out, water droplets trailing down his chest, his shirt casually unbuttoned.  
  
He looked infuriatingly perfect even in his post-shower laziness.  
  
""Got some work stuff to handle. I'm outta here,"" he grabbed his jacket like nothing had happened between them.  
  
Victoria's lips curved into a knowing smile. ""Work stuff, huh? Or are you running off to play hero for your little princess?""  
  
""What?"" He hadn't quite caught that.  
  
""Nothing."" She slipped out of bed, bare feet sinking into the plush carpet.  
  
His eyes darkened as he stepped closer, thumb brushing over her swollen lips. ""Be good. Don't cause any trouble.""  
  
The moment the door clicked shut, Victoria's smile vanished completely.  
  
She called an Uber and followed him.  
  
Thirty minutes later, she watched through the rain as Sophia Parvis ran out of the hotel entrance in a flowing white dress.  
  
Kairos immediately shrugged off his jacket, wrapping it around her shoulders before scooping her up in his arms.  
  
""Sophia, it's freezing. Why didn't you grab a coat, huh?""  
  
The way he moved was so natural and practiced, like he'd done this a thousand times before.  
  
Victoria's knuckles went white as she gripped the door handle, nails digging into her palms.  
  
Watching Kairos carry Sophia into the hotel with such careful devotion, she couldn't help but think back to the first time they'd met.  
  
She'd been at war with her father back then.  
  
After their latest explosive fight‚Äîone that ended with her throwing something at his head‚Äîhe'd shipped her off to his business partner's son, claiming she needed someone to ""tame that spoiled princess attitude.""  
  
Kairos had been sitting behind his massive desk on the top floor of Emperson Industries, his eyes behind those designer glasses were cold as winter.  
  
Of course she didn't want to stay here, so she'd been determined to make his life hell.  
  
Day one: she ""accidentally"" spilled coffee all over his thousand-dollar suit. He'd barely glanced up. ""Italian cashmere. Bill the Orlando account.""  
  
Day two: she fed important documents through the shredder. He'd recited the entire presentation from memory, leaving the whole boardroom speechless.  
  
Day three: she'd slipped something into his coffee and set up a camera, planning to blackmail him with the embarrassing footage.  
  
Instead, she'd ended up being his cure.  
  
She'd woken up the next morning sore in places, ready to murder him. But Kairos had simply pinned her against the floor-to-ceiling windows and taken her all over again.  
  
""Victoria,"" he'd whispered against her ear, voice rough with want. ""Be good for me.""  
  
That was it. Game over.  
  
No one had called her that since her mother died.  
  
Everything changed after that night.  
  
Every time she acted out, Kairos would simply carry her into his office. Everyone thought he was disciplining her, but really he was bending her over his desk until she could barely walk.  
  
And God help her, she became addicted to it.  
  
Was it because he was that good in bed? Or because she was just that lonely?  
  
She didn't know. All she knew was that she'd fallen hard.  
  
So on his birthday, she'd spent the entire day decorating his penthouse. Rose petals, candles, music‚Äîshe'd even bought an engagement ring.  
  
Victoria had waited all night. The candles burned out, the roses wilted, and Kairos never showed.  
  
At 3 AM, her phone buzzed with a news alert:  
  
""Manhattan Heir Spotted with Mystery Woman at Airport""  
  
The photo showed Kairos carefully helping a girl in white into his car, his expression softer than she'd ever seen it.  
  
The comments were brutal:  
  
""OMG is that actually Kairos Emperson smiling?!""  
  
""Holy shit, that's Sophia Parvis! They were golden couple at our Columbia!""  
  
""I knew them in college. Dude was ice cold to everyone except her. If she hadn't gotten sick and moved to Switzerland, they'd probably be married by now.""  
  
Her phone clattered to the floor.  
  
Victoria stared at the screen in disbelief.  
  
If Kairos had been in love with someone else this whole time, then what the hell was she? Just some convenient fuck toy he could call whenever he was bored?  
  
Her hands were shaking as she tried calling Kairos, desperate for some kind of explanation. But every call went straight to voicemail.  
  
After the tenth failed attempt, Victoria put down her phone and walked toward the one room Kairos had always kept off-limits‚Äîhis study.  
  
The moment she pushed open the door, it felt like getting struck by lightning.  
  
The entire room was basically a Sophia Parvis museum.  
  
Graduation photos, vacation shots, candid pictures of her sleeping. Even Mr. Ice-Cold-Control-Freak had turned into a total stalker.  
  
Victoria started laughing‚Äîa harsh, broken sound that echoed off the walls.  
  
The laughter turned to tears, hot and angry, streaming down her face and hitting the hardwood floor.  
  
She lost it completely and trashed the entire penthouse.  
  
When Kairos came home the next day and saw the destruction, he just calmly called the cleaning service. Didn't even look at her, like her having a complete meltdown was just another Tuesday.  
  
Victoria watched the staff sweep up the engagement ring she'd bought him, tossing it in the trash like it was nothing.  
  
He had no idea what was in that little velvet box.  
  
No idea she'd wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.  
  
No idea that watching it disappear into the garbage was the moment she decided she was done loving him.  
  
""Miss, where to?"" The driver's voice snapped her back to reality.  
  
""Home."" Victoria opened her eyes, voice flat and cold. ""The Orlando place.""",2,1752309199.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

üëâ CONTINUE READING üëà

# Chapter 1

""Attorney Whitlock, I just sent you a copy of the divorce agreement. My husband and I signed it on our the first day of marriage. Could you review it for any issues?""

Nova Sterling stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of her phone.

""Ms. Sterling, I've reviewed the agreement. Everything appears to be in order,"" the lawyer said professionally over the line. ""There's one month left until the three-year term expires. Once it does, the agreement automatically takes effect. You can simply go to the civil affairs bureau to get the divorce certificate.""

""Alright. Thank you.""

Hanging up, Nova lifted her gaze to the wedding photo on the wall.

In the picture, she wore pure white satin, her smile so bright it crinkled her eyes into crescents.

Beside her, Zane Blackthorn stood impeccably tailored in his suit, features strikingly handsome‚Äîyet devoid of even a hint of warmth.

Love and its absence are equally visible

""The day is almost here. You must be thrilled."" Her fingertip lightly brushed the cold, chiseled line of his jaw in the photograph.

The front door lock clicked. Nova withdrew her hand and turned.

""Welcome home."" She took the suit jacket Zane shrugged off and knelt to switch his shoes for slippers‚Äîthe motions fluid from countless repetitions.

Zane loosened his tie, expression cool. ""The Blackthorn Group anniversary gala is next month. Your presence is required.""

Nova paused while straightening his jacket. ""I won't be there.""

""Why not?"" He frowned.

She just opened her mouth, but Zane grasped her meaning instantly. His eyes frosted over. ""Because I've been with Ivy? I told you on our wedding day, Nova. I loved someone else. And¬†you¬†promised not to interfere.""

Nova's heart clenched as if brutally ripped open.

Exactly. Whose husband announces on his wedding night that he loves another woman and presents a divorce agreement set for three years later?

All she meant was that she wouldn't even be there next month‚Äîa cold contractual obligation ending, not a marital refusal.

Three years earlier, the Sterling-Blackthorn marriage alliance had sent shockwaves through their circles.

Nova‚Äîwho'd secretly loved Zane since childhood‚Äîwas overjoyed.

But on their wedding night, he'd handed her divorce papers.

""I love someone else,"" he'd stated, tone arcti,. ""Her background's ordinary. The Blackthorns won't accept her."" His gaze never wavered, ""I need three years to secure control of the Group. Once I'm head, no one will oppose us. Until then, we play the perfect couple. When the term ends, we divorce.""

Nova signed that night as he wished. Then wept in the bathroom until dawn.

Yet within three months, Ivy Callahan vanished without a trace after throwing a fit over Zane..

He searched frantically, using every resource. But nothing.

Night after night, he never came home. When he did stumble back, whiskey clung to him like a curse, his eyes darker than a grave.

Then one midnight, drunk beyond reason, he'd pinned her to the bed.

His whiskey-laced kiss descended, but the name on his lips‚Äî

""Ivy‚Ä¶ why leave? Why be with him? Don't you trust me?""

Nova froze. Her heart felt crushed.

He'd found her.

And she'd chosen another.

That night was Nova's first. Zane held her close, whispering another woman's name until dawn.

When he saw the bloodstain next morning, something flickered in his eyes. He said nothing.

Nova pretended nothing happened. She laid out his clothes, softly reminding him of his morning meeting‚Äîplaying the perfect wife while shattered inside.

After that, she redoubled her care:

She simmered gut-healing bone broth at dawn for his gastritis. Mastered massage for his stress. Moved in library-quiet steps for his peace‚Äîsilencing her own needs..

Slowly, Zane seemed to accept her as his wife:

Bringing small gifts from trips.

Brewing medicine when she was ill.

Holding her some nights, palm warm on her waist.

He never mentioned the divorce again.

Nova dared hope he might love her.

That fragile hope died three months ago when Ivy returned single.

Zane went back to her instantly:

Dining together.

Shopping together.

Canceling critical meetings just because Ivy felt down.

Watching his car speed toward Ivy's apartment, Nova finally understood.

True love was true love.

No sacrifice could eclipse one glance from Ivy.

Freedom, at last: her three-year contractual prison sentence was ending.

These years were a dream.

Time to wake and leave.

""Cat got your tongue?""

Zane's voice yanked her back. Nova stared at him, throat constricting.

He‚Ä¶ didn't remember the divorce contract?

For three years, she'd counted every day‚Äîdreading when he'd walk away. Now he seemed oblivious.

She parted her lips to remind him‚Äîwhen his phone rang.

The moment the call connected, Ivy's tear-choked sob pierced the air. Though Nova couldn't decipher the words, she saw Zane's face contort.

""Don't be afraid,Lvy. I'm coming.""

He hung up, grabbed keys, and bolted. His shoulder slammed into hers. Nova stumbled back‚Äîspine hitting the doorjamb. A gasp escaped her.

But Zane never looked back; he vanished through the doorway without so much as a backward glance..

Leaning on the wall, Nova limped to the bedroom. The jacket came off‚Äîa bruise already bloomed on her shoulder. She treated it silently, each motion sawing at her heart.

She sat on the bed, watching dusk fall, until her phone rang‚ÄîZane.

""Come to City Central Hospital.""

Her heart lurched. ""What happened?""

""Explain when you arrive..""

At the hospital, she saw them: Zane outside surgery doors, Ivy sobbing in his arms.

Nova froze mid-step. An invisible fist seized her chest, breath sawing in her throat.

""What's wrong?"" she whispered, approaching.

Zane's gaze lifted. ""Ivy's mother has acute leukemia. Needs immediate bone marrow transplant.""

""And?""

""No matches in the city."" His voice was flat. ""I tested compatible.""

Her eyes widened. ""You're donating?""

""There are risks‚Äî""

""I didn't ask your consent."" He cut her off. ""I need family authorization.""

Family‚Ä¶

The word stabbed deep.

Legally, she was still his wife.

His heart's family stood weeping beside him.

Nova's nails dug into her palms.

""Fine."" Her voice sounded distant. ""I'll sign.""

The consent form appeared. She signed‚Äîeach stroke like carving her heart.

Zane disentangled from Ivy, turning toward the OR.

Nova's lips trembled. All that emerged was a fractured whisper, ""‚Ä¶Take care of yourself.""

Zane's gaze flickered almost imperceptibly‚Äîbut he say nothing, turning into the surgical suite.

The doors hissed shut.

That¬†was when her tears shattered.

In that sterile corridor, she finally understood: Zane's devotion to Ivy ran deep enough to wager his life.

# Chapter 2

The operating room light glowed steadily. Silence hung thick in the corridor, broken only by the sound of breathing.

Nova sat on the waiting bench, fingers leaching cold. Across from her, Ivy Callahan dabbed at red-rimmed eyes, her gaze flickering anxiously toward the surgery doors.

Finally, Ivy spoke, her voice thin with tears, ""Ms. Sterling‚Ä¶ I'm sorry for causing trouble again.""

Nova met her eyes but remained silent.

Ivy wiped fresh tears, ""I never imagined‚Ä¶ after all these years, Zane would still feel this deeply for me."" She paused, lost in memory. ""You know? Last year on my birthday, he flew to Val-de-R√™ve just to deliver a necklace‚Ä¶ a style I'd casually mentioned liking years before. He¬†remembered. And I‚ÄîI was still angry with him. I threw it back at him. Didn't even let him inside.""

Nova's fingers clenched. Her nails bit deep into her palms.

She remembered it all too clearly‚Äîlast year, when Zane Blackthorn told her he was going on a three-day business trip overseas. He'd returned with a necklace, handing it to her carelessly. She'd treasured it, storing it in the deepest corner of her jewelry box, too precious to wear. Now she knew‚Äîit was Ivy's unwanted discard.

Ivy continued, her voice trembling, ""Then Christmas the year before‚Ä¶ My boyfriend and I had a huge fight. I posted something bleak online. Zane saw it. He flew through the night and stood outside my apartment building until dawn. He stood outside my apartment building until morning. In the middle of a snowstorm, no less. Just‚Ä¶ waiting. But he never once knocked..""

Nova's heart twisted like a knife.

She remembered that Christmas night.

Zane had taken her seven times with desperate intensity. She'd thought passion had finally sparked between them. When she woke, his side of the bed was cold. She assumed he'd left to handle some urgent business.

So... he had rushed to Ivy after all.

""These three years‚Ä¶"" Ivy's tears fell freely now, ""I ignored him. Cut off contact out of spite. But Zane never forgot me. Not one day. He wrote me a letter¬†every single day‚Äîeven when I never replied.""

Nova felt the air thicken, suffocating.

How many late nights had she seen the study light on?

She'd thought he was working, bringing him coffee.

So... he'd been writing love letters to Ivy.

She'd believed‚Äîduring those years Ivy was gone‚Äîthat Zane had genuinely tried to build a life with her.

Now she understood. It had always been her own delusion.

The heart she thought she'd warmed? It had belonged to someone else all along.

As Ivy drew breath to continue, Nova surged to her feet.

Her face was bloodless, her voice unnaturally calm. ""I have things to do. I'll go ahead..""

She didn't wait for Ivy's response. Turning, she walked swiftly away‚Äîfaster and faster, until she was nearly running.

Back home, Nova packed her belongings in silence. She was ready. Ready for the divorce agreement's final day.

In the weeks that followed, Ivy's social media feed became a chronicle of Zane's devotion.

His surgery was successful, yet he rested no time. He secured the finest hospital suite for Ivy's mother. He summoned a top international medical team. He personally reviewed every treatment plan.

Ivy's latest post was a photo.

Zane sat beside a hospital bed, an IV line taped to his arm. He bent intently over a pomegranate, peeling it for Ivy.

Her caption read:\[Could never find someone who loves me like this.\]

Nova's heart seized. A tear splashed onto her phone screen, blurring the image of Zane's tender profile.

Memories flooded her‚Äîyears spent caring for him just as diligently:

Brewing bone broth each dawn for his delicate stomach.

Leaving lights on when he worked late into the night.

Placing peeled, pitted, perfectly sliced fruit by his hand‚Ä¶

Now he did these things for another.

Nova drew a shuddering breath. She wiped her tears.

It didn't matter.

When she stopped loving him?

She would learn to love herself.

# Chapter 3

A week later, Zane unexpectedly returned home.

Nova was surprised. By all logic, he should've been at Ivy's side constantly.

""Family dinner tonight. Change clothes,"" he stated flatly.

Understanding, Nova silently changed into an appropriate gown and followed him.

The Blackthorns' dining hall hummed with the usual orchestrated charm‚Äîcrystal goblets gleaming, practiced smiles flashing. Eventually, the conversation turned to them.

""Three years married‚Äîtime for children, surely?""

""Indeed, Zane. You're head of the family now. An heir is essential.""

""Nova, dear, best not delay‚Ä¶""

Nova kept her eyes lowered, tracing the rim of her wineglass. Silent.

Then Zane spoke. He'd been quiet all evening.

""No rush.""

His voice was low, yet it silenced the entire dining room.

Faces froze. No one dared challenge the new family head. The meal ended in strained silence.

Afterward, Anna Blackthorn rose, her gaze sharp as a blade. ""Nova. My study. Now.""

Everyone knew this was about heirs.

Zane frowned, ""Whatever you have to say, say it to me.""

Anna opened her mouth‚Äîbut Zane's phone rang.

He glanced at the caller ID‚Äîhis expression shifted instantly. He stepped aside, answering with a tenderness Nova had never heard. ""Ivy? What's wrong?""

Anna snorted, ""With me,"" she commanded Nova.

Nova gave a faint, resigned press of her lips before wordlessly trailing after her..

The study door clicked shut. Anna's face turned thunderous.

""Kneel.""

Nova lowered herself onto the cold marble floor.

""Do you know your failing?"" Anna's voice dripped ice.

Nova stared at the floor. Silent.



Anna slammed her palm on the desk. ""Your failing is that when Zane said 'no rush,' you didn't¬†persuade¬†him otherwise!"" She yanked open a drawer, slamming down a silver jar. ""Fertility tonic. You will drink it daily. You¬†will¬†share his bed nightly. Until you conceive.""

Once, Nova would have meekly obeyed.

This time, she lifted her head. Her voice was soft, unyielding. ""I won't take it.""

Anna's eyes narrowed to slits. ""What did you say?""

""I won't take it. Zane doesn't want a child yet. I respect his decision.""

All those years.

Zane had always used protection. Those rare moments he lost control? He'd watched her swallow the morning-after pill himself. She'd thought he simply wasn't ready.

Now she knew.¬†He never wanted a child¬†with her.

Now that she was leaving? She wouldn't chain herself to him with his baby.

""What¬†did you say?"" Anna's voice rose shrilly.

""I refuse.""

""Insolence!"" Anna trembled with rage. ""You fail as a wife! And you let Zane donate his marrow to Ivy's mother?!"" She snapped her fingers. ""Bring the discipline rod!""

A servant appeared, holding a salt-soaked rattan cane.

Anna gripped it, looming over Nova. ""Final chance. Will. You. Take it?""

Nova shook her head.



The first lash exploded across her back. White-hot fire seared through her nerves. Nova clenched her teeth. Sweat soaked through her gown.

""Will you take it?!""

She clenched her jaw, refusing to take it.

The cane fell again. And again.

Through the study's floor-to-ceiling window, Nova saw Zane in the garden. Still on the phone.

His back was to her. His posture relaxed. She saw the curve of his cheek as he laughed softly at something Ivy said.

# Chapter 4

""Then I'll beat sense into you about a wife's duty!""

The cane ripped through fabric, carving bloody stripes into her skin. Nova trembled with pain but held her ground.

""I won't take it‚Ä¶""

Blood saturated her dress. Her vision blurred.

The last thing she saw was Zane's back‚Äîstill talking on the phone.

Before darkness devoured consciousness, Nova clung to one thought:¬†Let this be the final martyrdom. After tonight, my heart bleeds for him no more..

Nova woke in a hospital bed.

A respectful voice drifted nearby‚Äîthe hospital director:

""Mr. Blackthorn, the cane wounds are severe. Some lacerations reached the epidermal layer‚Äî""

""Use the best medication. Assign your top specialists."" Zane's voice was ice. ""No scarring.""

""Understood. We'll spare no effort.""

As the director left, Zane turned and saw her open eyes.

He strode to the bedside, brow furrowed. ""How do you feel?""

Nova shifted slightly. Fire blazed across her back.

""I'm fine,"" she managed. ""The staff here are excellent. You should go‚Ä¶ if you're needed elsewhere.""

To her surprise, Zane didn't leave.

He sat beside her, his gaze complex. ""Why didn't you call for me when mother confronted you?""

Nova remembered his turned back, his absorbed conversation with Ivy. A bitter smile touched her lips. ""You seemed occupied.""

She paused, then asked softly, ""If I had called‚Ä¶ would you really have come?""

""Immediately."" No hesitation.

Nova froze.

The answer shocked her.

""I've handled the family,"" he continued. ""No one will pressure you about children again.""

""Understood."" Nova looked down. ""You should go.""

""Why do you keep dismissing me?"" Zane's frown deepened.

She blinked. ""Aren't you‚Ä¶ busy?""

With the company. With Ivy.

""Not currently."" He smoothed her bedsheet. ""I'll stay with you these next days.""

Nova was stunned.

True to his word, Zane stayed.

He adjusted her bed. Fed her meals. Even changed her bandages himself.

One night, pain kept her awake. Zane sat beside her, soothing her back with gentle strokes until she finally slept.

For a suspended moment, Zane's tenderness spun Nova back to their fragile season of intimacy.

But Nova wouldn't drown in it again.

Her path was carved in stone now: forward, away, never retracing steps to his ruinous shore.

A week later, the welts had faded significantly.

As Zane applied ointment, a light gasp escaped her.

His hands stilled.

Nova turned‚Äîand froze. Desire blackened his eyes, his throat working. Then she felt it: the hard, urgent press against her hip..

Her breath hitched.

Zane leaned closer, his breathing roughening.

Just as his lips brushed hers‚Äî

The sound shattered the moment.

They jerked apart.

Let‚Äôs Talk! üöÄüçî,"Yo Redditors, buckle up because I‚Äôve got a spicy food delivery story to share, and I NEED your thoughts on this! üò§

So, I was hangry AF today and decided to try Swiggy Bolt, their shiny new 10-minute delivery service. You know, the one they‚Äôre hyping up like it‚Äôs gonna teleport your biryani straight to your doorstep? 

Yeah, that one. They promise food in 10 minutes‚Äîlike, whoa, that‚Äôs faster than I can decide what to eat! üòÖ I was pumped, thinking I‚Äôd be munching on my burger and fries in no time. Ordered from a nearby joint, hit that ‚ÄúBolt‚Äù button, and waited for the magic to happen.

Plot twist: 40 freaking minutes later, my food finally shows up. FORTY. MINUTES. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My stomach was basically staging a protest by then, and the fries? Let‚Äôs just say they were more ‚Äúsoggy sadness‚Äù than ‚Äúcrispy perfection.‚Äù üò¢ I‚Äôm out here wondering if Swiggy Bolt is just a marketing gimmick or if I got super unlucky. Like, is 10-minute delivery even possible in the chaos of Indian traffic? üöóüí®

Here‚Äôs the tea: Swiggy says Bolt works by partnering with restaurants within a 2-km radius and focusing on quick-to-prep items like burgers, coffee, or ice cream. They‚Äôve got big names like KFC, Starbucks, and local faves on board, and they claim delivery partners aren‚Äôt pressured to speed (no penalties or incentives for timing). Sounds great on paper, right? But 40 minutes for a ‚Äú10-minute‚Äù delivery has me side-eyeing the whole thing. üòí

So, Reddit fam, let‚Äôs unpack this:
Is 10-minute food delivery actually practical? With traffic, restaurant prep times, and delivery logistics, can they really pull this off consistently?
Have you tried Swiggy Bolt? Drop your stories‚Äîdid you get your food in 10 minutes, or were you left hangry like me?

Is this just a quick-commerce hype train? 

Zomato tried 10-minute delivery and bailed in 2023, saying it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. Is Swiggy setting itself up for a fall, or are they cracking the code?
What‚Äôs the deal with delivery partners? Swiggy says they don‚Äôt tell riders if it‚Äôs a Bolt order to avoid rash driving, but does that mean the system‚Äôs just not optimized for speed?

I‚Äôm lowkey worried this push for ‚Äúinstant‚Äù delivery is gonna burn out delivery folks or lead to cold, rushed food. ü•ê But I also get it‚Äîsometimes you just NEED that coffee or biryani ASAP. ‚ö° So, is super-fast delivery the future, or is it an overhyped dream? Let‚Äôs get this convo popping‚Äîupvote if you‚Äôve ever been hangry waiting for ‚Äúquick‚Äù delivery! üôå

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story‚Äîsomething about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation‚Äîuntil she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest‚Äîhis childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton‚Äîthe admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical‚Äîsaving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I‚Äî""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look‚Äîone that screamed, 'See? You lost again, Audrey. I'm the one Clayton cares about above all.'

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they'd look like a perfect family.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

'What if he weren't here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton's too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing her hero.'

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn't going to keep tolerating this broken marriage‚Äînot for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she'd have to sue him, and she knew she'd be at a disadvantage. But she wasn't scared. It was hard, but it didn't mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a ""real"" couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition‚Äîshe'd buy her own house with her own money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn't huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She'd barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she'd been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn't spend a dime of Clayton's money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself‚Äîonly to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building's property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, ""Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.""

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, ""I'm the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That's trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I'm holding them and this property company accountable.""

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style‚Äîwhite walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn't have enough budget to renovate it, but it was clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn't move in yet.

But now, they really couldn't move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once-pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere‚Äîgod knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton's place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

\*\*\*\*\*

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton's good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, ""She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You'll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she's currently fine. Still, don't take it lightly.""

""Thank you, doctor."" Valerie's eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, ""Clay, I don't know what I would've done without you.""

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie's heart dropped, and she thought, 'No. I can't let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.'

Through tears, she said, ""This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left Luna outside like that. But you know what Audrey did last time.

""Luna already has autism, and she's still scared from that scene. I didn't have a choice but to leave her in the living room.""

# Chapter 4 Audrey's Fight Back

""You know Luna is my whole world,"" Valerie sobbed, covering her face with both hands. ""Back then, I took beatings just to protect her. If anything happens to her now because of my carelessness, I won't forgive myself.""

Hearing her cry, Clayton felt a sudden wave of irritation rising in his chest.

He said, ""The doctor said she's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Honestly, getting her out of that mess is already brave. I've got stuff to deal with. You stay here and look after Luna, okay?""

A bad feeling crept up Valerie's spine. She asked cautiously, ""Are you worried Audrey will be mad? I can take Luna and leave. I swear we won't cause you any trouble.""

""You don't have to leave,"" Clayton replied, rubbing his temples. ""It's something at the firm.""

The real reason Clayton had Audrey sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital on her birthday was because she cut Valerie's hand. Valerie's reputation was just a minor cause.

He thought getting Audrey out of the picture would calm Valerie down, and then maybe she'd agree to drop the charges. If Audrey ended up with a record, she'd be blacklisted from half the job market.

Clayton had connections at Ashwood‚Äîhis law firm handled some of their legal affairs. He personally asked the manager to put Audrey in a quiet, nicer section of the hospital and told him she just needed time to cool off.

""Audrey is not the kind to hold grudges,"" Clayton added absentmindedly.

Valerie almost lost control of her expression. She opened her mouth to say more, but Clayton had already turned around and left the ward.

Carson, waiting outside the ward, walked down the stairs with Clayton. Carson said, ""Look, man, don't take this the wrong way, but Valerie's got a strange look in her eyes when she sees you.""

Clayton shot Carson a look that could freeze hell. He warned, ""Say that again, and you're not my friend anymore.""

""Alright, alright."" Carson raised his hands in surrender. ""I'm done. Just keep your eyes open. Audrey's not your match, but she's been really good to you.""

Clayton's eyes flickered, then he turned around and left the hospital. Carson stood there watching him leave and shaking his head.

None of the guys in their circles planned to get married, and they definitely hadn't supported Clayton's impulsive marriage just to spite his family for arranging an alliance for him.

But Audrey's devotion after they got married made a few of them reconsider the whole bachelor lifestyle.

When Clayton brought Valerie back into the picture and started putting her first in everything, Carson warned him not to keep Audrey in the dark.

On Audrey's birthday, Clayton had planned to finally come clean. But they were a bit late, and the accident happened.

Once Valerie was sure the two men had left, the soft worry and guilt drained from her face in an instant. Her whole expression turned cold as she looked at Luna lying on the bed.

She muttered, ""Useless. Couldn't you have eaten a few more chestnuts? You are in no danger. Clay didn't even care to stay.""

Luna's small frame shrank into itself. Her head was too big for her frail body. She stared at her mother, her eyes wide with fear and confusion.

Just minutes after Clayton walked out, Audrey stepped into the hospital.

Carson spotted Audrey and assumed she was there to give Valerie a hard time. He was about to call Clayton when he overheard two nurses whispering nearby.

The first nurse said, ""Oh my, no one can stop them? Beating people is illegal.""

Another nurse replied, ""A 10-year-old or so boy died there last year. His folks spent six months in court. In the end, they called it an accident and got a little compensation.""

Carson walked over and said behind them, ""You two work here or just gossip for a living?""

The nurses giggled upon seeing Carson. He was kind of a big deal around here, returning from abroad with a flashy resume.

The first nurse explained, ""We were talking about Ashwood Mental Hospital, Dr. Wilson. That place is hell. I don't get why some parents send their kids there just to get them beat up.""

The other nurse added, ""The owners have people backing them. If someone gets hurt or even dies, they just throw money at it. That woman had bruises all over. Hope she gets some justice.""

Carson's brows furrowed upon hearing that. He knew Clayton had sent Audrey to Ashwood.

Lots of kids had behavioral issues, tech addictions, and attitude problems. It was said Ashwood could straighten them out.

Carson didn't think giving troubled teens a little tough love was a big deal. As far as he was concerned, a place like Ashwood Mental Hospital had its uses. Plus, Clayton knew the manager there, and Audrey was an adult, so surely they'd treat her differently.

""You can't write off a whole institution just because of a few bad stories. If it exists, there's a reason,"" Carson said before heading back to his office.

That conversation made him forget all about calling Clayton.

Meanwhile, Audrey sat in a park, holding her injury report. The staff at Ashwood didn't dare beat her outright, but they played all kinds of mental games and messed with her food.

When she caught wind of her release, she used a bathroom break to rough herself up a bit. The bruises looked terrifying but weren't actually deep.

She waited until nearly 4 p.m. before spotting a familiar figure rushing by. Audrey stood up and called out, ""Mr. Sanchez.""

Leo Sanchez, Ashwood's manager, was in his forties with a beer belly. He strode like he had something urgent to do. He glanced at Audrey and instantly looked annoyed.

""Audrey? What do you want?"" he snapped, not even bothering to call her ""Mrs. Patel"".

Audrey crooked her finger at him, signaling for him to sit on the bench.

Leo's face turned grim. He snapped, ""If you've got something to say, spit it out. I'm busy.""

""Are you rushing to Little Dreamers Preschool to pick up your lovechild?"" Audrey raised her voice.

Leo's face turned an ugly shade of red. His eyes were filled with panic and fury.

No one was supposed to know about the kid he had with his mistress, but he didn't know how Audrey found out.

The park was full of parents with their kids. If anyone heard that, word would spread fast, and he couldn't risk that kind of heat falling on his son.

Grinding his teeth, Leo walked over and sat stiffly on the bench. ""Now, talk.""

Audrey waved the medical report and tossed it onto his lap. ""While I was locked up at Ashwood, I was abused‚Äîphysically and emotionally‚Äîby your staff. I want compensation for medical bills, nutrition recovery, and psychological damage.""

Leo's eyes nearly popped out at the number‚Äî150,000 dollars. He growled, ""This is extortion.""

Audrey let out a cold chuckle. ""Call it what you want. If you think I'm bluffing, I'll go straight to the cops or the press. You pick.""

A smirk flickered in Leo's eyes. He knew Clayton's law firm represented Ashwood. Clayton had personally called to make sure Audrey ""learned her lesson"". He was sure that Clayton would help her with the lawsuit.

""Does Mr. Patel know what you're up to?"" Leo asked.

Audrey thought, 'Trying to use Clayton against me? I used to care about his feelings, but now, I'd skin him alive if I could.'

She folded her arms with a sneer. ""Did Clayton also tell you I've got violent tendencies? Kinda like being legally insane."" Her voice dropped lower. ""So tell me, what would happen if I lost my mind and stabbed your son? Who would the law blame then?""

Leo's face drained of color. Audrey's file did say she had a history of extreme behavior. His staff also reported she was stubborn as hell. When they locked her in solitary, she still refused to admit anything.

Leo thought bitterly, 'This woman is really insane. Ashwood only exists because my father-in-law pulled strings. If they find out I've got a mistress and a secret kid, I'm toast.

'Valerie's about to become Mrs. Patel, anyway. Once the divorce goes through and Audrey's out of the picture, I'll stash my kid somewhere and deal with her then.'

# Chapter 5 I'm Her Family

""Fine. I'll pay your medical bills."" Leo said through clenched teeth.

Audrey tossed a pen onto his lap and said, ""Sign it. Can't have you crying later that I blackmailed you.""

Leo hunched over the paper, his expression murderous. But when he looked up again, his face had smoothed out. He then transferred the 150,000 dollars to her account without a word.

The second Leo stepped out of the park, Audrey sent a message to Leo's wife.

She sneered to herself, 'Think you'll come back for revenge? Keep dreaming. That money wasn't hush money. It was compensation. What Ashwood does behind closed doors will all be shown to the public.'",2,1752308452.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Mila POV

‚ÄúDo as your mother says.‚Äù

Stepmother, you mean, I wanted to say. Instead, I stood silently, my lips pressed into a thin line, as my father informed me that I had to go on this so-called weekend trip they had planned with his friend. I know why exactly this trip was planned and I would rather stay away from it.

The plan is to go on a weekend getaway in the vacation house of My father‚Äôs dangerous, mafia friend. Killian Knight. If you‚Äôre smart, you stay out of his way. If you‚Äôre wise, you become his friend‚Äîif you can manage it, that is.

I‚Äôve never met him, only seen photos, but I know enough. And what I know is enough for me to decide that he is too dangerous and too close to my father for comfort. He kills people for a living, and I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôd rather live my life without the constant threat of being snuffed out in my sleep. Besides, I can‚Äôt go on this little ""family-friendly"" trip. I‚Äôll never have an opportunity like this again: three days alone, unsupervised. There are things I need to do and people to expose.

‚ÄúBut Father‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo buts!‚Äù

I refrained from rolling my eyes.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Adeline‚Äîmy dearest stepmother‚Äîwearing a smug expression. She tried her best to suppress it in front of my father. She wants this, she wants to secure her son's position as the next chairperson of Anderson Cooperate Empire and also doesn't let anyone know that she is stealing my rights.

The look on my father‚Äôs face told me it was pointless to argue.

I am so not in the mood to play Happy Family charade.

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù I said, trying my best not to roll my eyes or give a sigh. I think I partially lost in the end.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look like I‚Äôve just killed your cat. This is a family vacation, and Mr. Knight and his wife have so graciously chosen to host us. I don‚Äôt want anyone backing out. We‚Äôll enjoy it like a family,‚Äù he said, his rough voice sounding like he had something stuck in his throat.

‚ÄúYes, my dear, we most certainly will,‚Äù Adeline added, placing her hand over his in what seemed like a loving gesture. My father smiled at her sweetly.

I held back my gag reflex.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll excuse myself, Father.‚Äù

He nodded without looking at me, and I slowly walked out of the study.

The devil‚Äôs spawn‚Äîmy stepbrother‚Äîwas leaning against the wall, waiting with a smirk on his face. I was sure he was there to gloat over my failed attempt to escape this hell trip.

‚ÄúTold you it‚Äôd never work. Father holds the Knights in high regard, and Mr. Knight invited the whole family, little sis,‚Äù he sneered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bold of you to assume I consider you family,‚Äù I shot back.

‚ÄúBe careful, sister. If Father hears you talking like that‚Ä¶‚Äù He put a hand to his chest in mock injury, then his expression darkened as he cocked his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be out of here.‚Äù

I gave him no response to his obvious threat. It was a threat that could very well come true any of these days considering my 21st birthday day is exactly one month away. It will be my end or I will be free from this prison I am forced to call home.

I slipped away down the hallway, past the lobby, and toward the giant staircase leading to the South Wing of the mansion.

This is the Andersons‚Äô ancestral house. My father, Tommen Anderson, is the third-generation Chairman of Anderson Group Of Companies, a multinational company worth over $3 trillion. As his firstborn, I am technically the heir to this corporate empire. But if my stepmother‚Äôs scheming works, my stepbrother might end up taking over the company.

I don't need Anderson Empire or neither I am so stuck up to hold on to the fact what was supposed to be mine and create havoc for it. The truth of my life is the shackle around my feet is this legacy and the only way to free it is to own it.

I remember it quite clearly when it was tied to me.

‚ÄúOnly an Anderson will sit on this chair. You must promise me, Mila,‚Äù my grandfather said when he first made me sit on the chairman‚Äôs chair behind the large, old mahogany desk at Anderson Tech‚Äôs headquarters. I was ten years old and had only recently learned that I was an Anderson.

I still remember him kneeling in front of me, looking me in the eye as I sat in the highest chair at Anderson Tech. His sea green eyes‚ÄîAnderson's eyes, the same eyes I see in the mirror every day‚Äî were cold, just like my father.

‚ÄúYou are the only valid candidate,‚Äù

I didn't know what to think until it became clear that I had just transferred from an iron cage - my orphanage to a golden one - the Anderson Mansion. He was nothing but a jailer.

Two years later, he passed away.

This weekend was supposed to be my lone opportunity to act without Adeline or Nicolas breathing down my neck. Three consecutive days‚Ä¶ but damn her for playing the perfect mother, pretending to care.

For five years, I‚Äôve been careful with every move I make. All anyone knows about me is that I‚Äôm an introverted art history student at New York University with massive social anxiety. A simple girl who thought she was an orphan and is now just \*grateful\* to have a family.

Adeline wants to control my every move. She‚Äôs no fool, though. She knows she has nothing concrete on me. She has always played the part of a concerned mother. I have seen her actual colors. I will not be waiting for that side to come up again.

My plans will have to wait.

I packed my bag, and the next morning, we were on our way. My father and stepmother rode in the Mercedes, while I was stuck with my stepbrother, Nicolas, and half-sister, Francesca, in the BMW.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while since we went to the beach. I‚Äôm excited!‚Äù Francesca‚Äîor Franny, as she insisted we call her‚Äîgushed.

I like her, surprisingly. She‚Äôs not annoying. But I hate her hair‚Äîthe glossy platinum blonde she inherited from her mother. It fell in perfect waves and looked even more angelic paired with the peach beach dress she was wearing. Her eyes were like mine, like my father‚Äôs, like my grandfather‚Äôs. She is Anderson, after all. Probably the only one who didn't look at me like I was a stranger.

I opened my phone, put in my earbuds, and watched a text pop onto the screen.

Are you coming today? \~ J

Later. \~ M

When? \~ J

3 d. \~ M

Damn \~ J

Yeah, yeah. You and I both.

We left the chaotic rhythm of New York City behind, merging onto the highway as the skyline faded in the rearview mirror. The air changed‚Äîcleaner, tinged with salt. A few hours later, we pulled into the Hamptons and parked in front of a grand beach house.

The car came to a halt, and I pulled my earbuds out. As I stepped out, the scent of sea salt filled my senses. If I had to find one redeeming quality about this trip, it was this view. I‚Äôd endure the monotonous gathering just for this.

‚ÄúThis is so beautiful!‚Äù Franny gushed again.

I glanced at the property where we‚Äôd be spending the weekend.

A wide, wraparound porch supported by white pillars overlooked the dunes, while tall, arched windows reflected the fading sunlight. Sprawling gardens surrounded the house, with perfectly manicured lawns stretching toward the sand. Vibrant flower beds lined the walkways, and mature trees cast dappled shadows over a stone fountain at the center of the property. The estate radiated timeless elegance‚Äîa true sanctuary.

Nicolas stepped out of the car, groaning dramatically as he put on his sunglasses.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hot,‚Äù he whined, tugging at the collar of his bright red shirt. A red shirt on a beach trip‚Äîtypical.

I shook my head, slipping my phone and earbuds into my sling bag and shutting the car door. Still, my gaze lingered on the spectacular view. What would it be like to call a place like this your own?

‚ÄúOh, well, we were waiting for you!‚Äù

An elegant woman in a white beach dress stepped onto the porch. She was lean, with an A-line figure and a height that gave her a commanding presence. Her warm smile, framed by red-painted lips, greeted my parents.

‚ÄúKate, thank you for having us,‚Äù Adeline said, performing one of those air kisses high-class women exchange. Kate followed up with a light kiss on my father‚Äôs cheek.

‚ÄúHow are you, Kate? It‚Äôs been a while,‚Äù my father said in what I assumed was his version of a charming tone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm great. Killian and I have been looking forward to this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is my friend‚Äî‚Äù

As if on cue, our host stepped onto the porch.

Khaki pants. A dark blue, fitted shirt that emphasized his broad shoulders and lean, muscular arms. He ran his hands through his hair, dark and tousled, gleaming under the sunlight.

My breath hitched when his eyes locked on mine.

# Chapter 2

Mila POV

Killian Knight had a presence about him. Even as he walked lazily toward us, it felt as though the very air surrounding him was his domain. His aura dared you to challenge his authority‚Äîor look away from him.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs hot!‚Äù Nicolai muttered under his breath.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs married,‚Äù Franny reminded him.

‚ÄúSo what? Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have eyes.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes at Nicolai.

Mr. Knight removed his glasses as he greeted my father. I instinctively stepped back, away from his line of sight. Father introduced Adeline first, then Nicolai, and finally Franny. Killian nodded in acknowledgment, his actions polite, graceful, and measured.

Something crackled in the air, and my gaze moved to his on its own accord. My hand twitched with an unnamed urge, and I quickly shoved it into my pocket, confused. My heart was thundering in my chest. Was it fear?

I reminded myself that our families had shared generations of friendship. I was just as safe here as in my own home‚Äîor so I told myself. I‚Äôd always lived this way, constantly questioning. What was there to be scared of now? I wasn‚Äôt one to back away from challenges, but I had to keep my stance neutral.

‚ÄúAnd who is this?‚Äù That deep, sophisticated voice caressed the air as it directed a question toward me.

‚ÄúThis is Mila,‚Äù my father answered simply and quickly. His indifference was nothing new to me, but I‚Äôd thought‚Äîperhaps hoped‚Äîthat in some corner of his heart, there might be an obligation to pretend otherwise.

‚ÄúMila,‚Äù Killian repeated, a smile gracing his lips as he stepped aside, his gaze fixing on me with unnerving precision. ‚ÄúYour eldest.‚Äù

The glint in his eyes reminded me of a black panther. A jolt of something ran through me, and the air seemed to thin. Mistaking my reaction for fear, I tried to suppress the rush of emotions as he extended his hand toward me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sweet name,‚Äù he said.

Without much thought, I slid my hand into his. His touch was surprisingly warm‚Äîthe kind of warmth you feel sitting by a fire during a snowstorm. Close enough to savor the heat but wary of the burn.

My breath hitched as his large, rough hand enclosed mine, making my own feel small. The sensation sent a shiver down my spine, one I struggled to suppress. My heart raced, and an unfamiliar undercurrent climbed through my nerves. Meeting his eyes again, I gave this feeling a name. It wasn‚Äôt fear. It was desire.

‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù Kate‚Äôs voice broke the spell, and my head snapped toward her.

Hell. What was I doing? I withdrew my hand quickly.

‚ÄúYes, we shall.‚Äù A casual smile lingered on Killian‚Äôs lips as he stepped aside.

‚ÄúThis way, Princess,‚Äù he murmured, so low I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd heard it right.

Kate and the others were already several steps ahead, but Killian walked right beside me. I schooled my expression, but it was difficult to ignore him when I was so hyper-aware of his every move.

‚ÄúNina will show you to your rooms. Once you‚Äôre settled, I‚Äôll give you a tour,‚Äù Kate said.

I didn‚Äôt stop or turn to acknowledge her as Nina, the head of the staff, led us. At the foot of the stairs, Killian halted, and I caught the faint trace of perfume. My pace quickened.

‚ÄúKillian, sweetie,‚Äù a voice called from behind.

Damn it. What was I thinking? He‚Äôs married.

Killian POV

I am bewitched. Mila Anderson cannot be human and real at the same time. Those sea-green siren eyes were meant to drown every soul they landed on. Her dark red hair cascaded to her waist, and the ripped jeans hugged her curves so perfectly it was almost criminal. She clutched the straps of her messenger bag as if her life depended on it, standing behind her family with her shoulders hunched. But when her eyelids fluttered and her gaze met mine‚Äîshe had me, right then and there.

Anderson had never brought his entire family with him before. I‚Äôve met his wife and his stepson, who seems to be his shadow. But I‚Äôve never met his daughters. I‚Äôve only caught a glimpse of the youngest once. This one must be the eldest. After a polite greeting, I finally turned my attention to the object of my interest. Mila.

The moment her hand slipped into mine, I knew there was no going back. The current that surged through me wasn‚Äôt just attraction or desire‚Äîit was something much deeper. Something undeniable.

As Nina showed our guests to their rooms, Mila lingered, trailing behind the others. Halfway up the staircase, she stopped. It would have been too obvious if I followed her, but resisting the pull was damn near impossible. I stayed rooted at the foot of the stairs, my eyes locked on her. She turned slightly, just enough for the corner of her eye to catch mine. I smiled.

She hesitated, almost turning fully toward me, as though she could feel the electric charge between us, pulsing, connecting her to me.

‚ÄúKillian, sweetie,‚Äù Kate‚Äôs voice cut through the moment like a knife. Mila jumped and bolted up the stairs.

‚ÄúDamn you, Katherine,‚Äù I muttered under my breath.

I stalked into the kitchen, where Kate leaned against the counter, watching me warily. Her expression told me she knew exactly what was going through my mind.

‚ÄúIf someone saw you looking at her like that, it wouldn‚Äôt end well,‚Äù she said, her tone cautious but laced with apology.

I folded my arms and tilted my head, smirking. ‚ÄúAnd how exactly am I looking at her?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike you‚Äôre going to devour her,‚Äù she shot back bluntly.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a reminder of what I can or can‚Äôt do,‚Äù I said, my voice sharp.

Kate hesitated before continuing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Anderson‚Äôs daughter. She‚Äôs young. Innocent. Don‚Äôt seduce her. That wouldn‚Äôt be... prudent.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you trying to be my wife now?‚Äù I arched an eyebrow, my tone challenging.

She flinched, unable to meet my gaze. ‚ÄúI have no desire to be,‚Äù she muttered, shaking her head.

I pulled out a chair, the legs scraping noisily against the floor as I sat down. The sound made her flinch again, but only for a moment. She straightened, likely reminding herself of her place. Kate was one of the best in my organization. She couldn‚Äôt afford to show weakness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your friend, Killian,‚Äù she said carefully. ‚ÄúThis could turn into a disaster. Find someone else for your amusement.‚Äù

I leaned back, and her shoulders visibly relaxed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre misunderstanding my intentions,‚Äù I said, my tone deceptively calm.

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? You‚Äôre serious about her? You just met her!‚Äù

I sighed, leaning forward lazily. ‚ÄúKate.‚Äù My voice was soft, but the warning was unmistakable. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget who I am.‚Äù

Her expression shifted instantly. Her posture straightened, the same way all my shadows do in my presence‚Äîalert, ready, and obedient.

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I stood, and she stepped aside instinctively.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt interrupt me again,‚Äù I said as I walked past her.

She gave a sharp nod, and I left without another word.

.

# Chapter 3

Mila's POV

Killian Knight‚Äîthe most dangerous man in the U.S.A. A mafia boss. A contract killer. Married.

¬†I repeated the mantra to myself, willing away the electric charge coursing through me.

My guest room was the last one in the corridor. I thanked Nina, shut the door behind her, and tossed my bag onto the four-poster bed. Pouring myself a glass of water, I downed it in seconds.

Maybe I‚Äôd neglected my body‚Äôs physical needs for far too long. There was no way I could be attracted to danger.

Throwing myself onto the bed, I took a few calming breaths. This had to be some form of shock.

Before I could dwell on it further, my phone rang. It was J.

¬†‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù Her incredulous tone greeted me.

I sighed. ‚ÄúI know. I couldn‚Äôt get out of it. I tried.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in Killian Knight‚Äôs house!‚Äù

¬†I shivered‚Äîfor reasons that had nothing to do with fear.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I replied quietly.

J sighed, clearly worried. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm cool with a lot of things, and if he were anyone else, I‚Äôd say seduce him and take the Anderson empire. But M! He‚Äôs dangerous. Get out of there! We don‚Äôt know what your evil stepmother is planning.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. It would be foolish to say I wasn‚Äôt wary, but Jina didn‚Äôt need to know that. She was worried enough for the both of us.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. No one‚Äôs going to kill me here,‚Äù I scoffed. I hope.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something to take lightly. The man runs a contract killer organization!‚Äù she whisper-hissed.

¬†‚ÄúAnd it makes no sense to kill me here,‚Äù I mimicked her tone.

¬†‚ÄúYou just like to play with fire.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs life without a little danger?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you quoting Harry Potter to me. We have K for that,‚Äù she snapped.

I snickered.

‚ÄúMila.‚Äù Her serious tone stopped me.

¬†‚ÄúHm?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt die.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

I hung up, and the smile slipped from my face. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather be with J and K than here. My stepmother‚Äôs scheming could rot in hell.

Out tour of the house ended by the poolside

As the others retreated inside, I lingered by the poolside. No one noticed as I crouched down, resting my chin on my knees. My heart felt heavy with a sense of lack. My family was always fake, carefully curated for appearances. My father‚Äôs indifference, my stepmother‚Äôs schemes, and my siblings‚Äô endless competition made it impossible to feel anything real. Even Kate‚Äôs warm smiles felt staged, a part of her duty as a host. Everything here was a charade, just like my life.

When would I experience something genuine?

‚ÄúDo you swim?‚Äù

Startled, I nearly tumbled into the water, but a strong arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me back from inches away from breaking the surface.

I gasped as I collided with something solid. The relaxed air thickened around us, and warmth spread from my stomach to my chest. Cinnamon and coffee enveloped my senses as I looked up.

Killian‚Äôs dark eyes met mine, their lethal glint holding me captive.

¬†‚ÄúMr. Knight,‚Äù I whispered.

We both were on the floor. I quickly put some distance between us, standing as he got up smoothly, resting an arm on his knee. The corner of his lips turned up. Why did those lips look so soft and inviting as he looked up at me, his hair falling onto his forehead as he cocked his head to the side? Did he look at everyone like that? Like he knew every secret they held, or he could see straight into the core of them?

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

I nodded. I couldn‚Äôt trust my voice right now. I didn‚Äôt think I had enough air in my lungs to speak, anyway. I should have moved, but my feet stayed rooted there. He got up swiftly, his movements smooth.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to startle you. My apologies,‚Äù he said softly, giving a little nod.

I nodded and stepped back.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I will‚Ä¶‚Äù I pointed to the door leading inside.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt answer.‚Äù

His voice was soft, alluring.

¬†‚ÄúAbout?‚Äù I turned back to look at him in confusion.

‚ÄúDo you swim?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to swim, but it‚Äôs nice here,‚Äù I said. Is telling a certified killer you can‚Äôt swim a good idea? Nope. I needed to get out of his presence. I didn‚Äôt have control of my mind‚Äîor my mouth‚Äîaround him.

‚ÄúMila!‚Äù Franny‚Äôs voice came floating. Thank God for her.

‚ÄúI should go,‚Äù I said, moving quickly. I exhaled the moment I was out of his sight.

Killian's POV

The dinner table was set. All that was left was to choose a wine.

I went to the back of the house and opened the cellar door. My grandfather‚Äôs wine collection was vast, filled with complex and meticulously aged vintage blends. Now, some of my choices were part of the collection too. Under the yellow light of the basement, I walked through the aisle, mulling over my options.

Finally, I made my choice‚ÄîDal Forno Romano Amarone della Valpolicella. Aged meticulously for over a decade, it held notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and a subtle spice.

As I headed back upstairs, wine in hand, I passed the staircase toward the kitchen. The sound of light footsteps made me pause. A glimpse out of the corner of my eye stopped me in my tracks.

And there she was.

Mila stood at the top of the staircase, looking down at her feet. Trails of red hair framed her small, square face, falling from a delicate half-braid. The rest of her hair flowed in soft waves over her shoulders. She wore a simple white, long-sleeved V-neck dress that fell below her knees, its hem tinged with a soft shade of blue.

I smiled. She was simple, yet there was something about the way she carried herself that made her impossible to ignore.

Finally, her gaze lifted, and those sea-green eyes widened when they met mine. I smirked in greeting.

For several seconds, no breath passed between us.

‚ÄúAre you just going to stand there?‚Äù I asked, breaking the silence.

At my question, her feet moved‚Äîonly for her to miss a step.

¬†‚ÄúMila,‚Äù I called her name. Was this the first time I‚Äôd said it out loud? I couldn‚Äôt be sure.

‚ÄúAre you not planning to join us?‚Äù I eased my smile and extended a hand. She looked at it, her expression softening instead of becoming wary, like most people in my presence.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

She descended a couple of steps before stopping, a small frown appearing as she looked up at me. When she reached the last step, I didn‚Äôt move aside.

Her red lips parted slightly.

‚ÄúCan you drink?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúLegally, no,‚Äù she shrugged.

¬†‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll be 21 in a month.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young.‚Äù

She stepped back a little, breaking our eye contact. ‚ÄúDo I look older to you?‚Äù

She tried to step around me.

¬†‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

I finally moved, letting her pass, the angle bringing her head close to my chin. I leaned toward her ear.

¬†‚ÄúThe most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

She stopped, turning sharply to look at me. Her sea-green eyes weren‚Äôt filled with confusion‚Äîbut awareness. A spark of disbelief flickered in their depths.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be saying that,‚Äù she whispered. She didn‚Äôt look offended or put off.

¬†‚ÄúI like to state facts.‚Äù

Blowing a stray strand of hair from her cheek, I walked away with a teasing smile.

# Chapter 4

Killian's POV¬†

When Tommen asked me about this get-together, I thought he was just following tradition‚Äîreestablishing the Anderson-Knight generational friendship that his grandfather and mine had started. It was meant to ensure the new generation understood the bonds not just of business but of familial relationships. Yet, I‚Äôve never gotten the impression he cared about any of that. Personally, I don‚Äôt either. Only tradition forces me to oblige the Andersons. We meet to discuss business logistics when required, but beyond that, we can barely be called business associates.

I first got to know him during one of these trips. The Hamptons house‚Äîour family‚Äôs vacation home‚Äîis far removed from the world I truly live in. It‚Äôs just another fa√ßade, like everything else in my life. This place has always served this purpose. With no real explanation for his request, I decided to humor him.

After dinner, we stepped into the garden. He lit a cigarette, and I slid my hands into my pockets, standing under the yellow glow of the garden lights. I looked at him‚Äîat the bags under his eyes, barely concealed by the arrogant tilt of his head or the sparkle of his Rolex. My jaw clenched. I despise cigarettes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt allow smoking in my presence,‚Äù I warned.

‚ÄúCome now, Killian,‚Äù he replied dismissively.

I should never have humored this man. I fixed him with a cold stare, watching as he visibly shivered. He tried to hide it, but the arrogant glint vanished from his eyes. Now he was probably remembering exactly where he was and who he was with. The cigarette fell to the ground, and he stubbed it out. I looked away, impatient.

He seemed nervous now, which wasn‚Äôt unusual‚ÄîI‚Äôm used to people reacting that way around me. But his cold eyes reminded me of someone else. Mila. Her wide, shocked eyes and flushed cheeks from our earlier interaction flitted through my mind. I‚Äôd much rather be seeing her.

He wasn‚Äôt speaking, and I was curious about one thing. One person.

‚ÄúTell me about Mila,‚Äù I said.

At dinner, her downcast eyes and slumped shoulders had caught my attention. The woman who had looked me in the eye and all but scolded me earlier wasn‚Äôt the same woman at that table. That woman had seemed more like a shy girl who couldn‚Äôt speak to save her life.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your eldest, yet you‚Äôve never brought her around before.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be bothered by her. Since her mother died, she‚Äôs been reserved. No one‚Äôs managed to draw her out of her shell, and she prefers it that way. Adeline insisted she come,‚Äù he explained.

During her time here, Mila had only spoken to people when politeness demanded it. She wasn‚Äôt close to her stepmother, but from what little I‚Äôd seen, she got along with her younger sister.

Tommen‚Äôs indifference toward his eldest daughter was glaringly obvious. I clenched my fist in my pocket, noting the affection he seemed to reserve for his second wife. Mila‚Äôs lack of interaction with her family made sense, but there was something about the fearlessness in her eyes that felt... different.

‚ÄúI called you out here to talk about my son,‚Äù he finally said, breaking the silence.

My instincts went on high alert as I sensed movement at the corner of a wall about ten feet away. I shifted slightly to keep both Tommen and the shadow in my view. A shoulder peeked out from behind the wall.

‚ÄúYour stepson,‚Äù I corrected, watching his reaction.

‚ÄúMy son needs your support when the board votes for the next chairperson.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would there be a vote?‚Äù

The Anderson succession plan had always been clear: the firstborn Anderson would take the seat. Despite this 70-year-old tradition, which made no distinction between genders, every generation thus far had conveniently produced firstborn sons. By that logic, Mila Anderson should be the next chairperson.

Tommen‚Äôs desire to have his stepson as heir would undoubtedly stir controversy among the board.

‚ÄúYou know the board. They‚Äôre a bunch of outdated fools who cling to tradition, insisting the firstborn Anderson should take the chair,‚Äù he said, clearly agitated.

‚ÄúAnd yet you believe your stepson is a more suitable candidate, even though he‚Äôs not an Anderson?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is an Anderson,‚Äù Tommen said, meeting my eyes for the first time. Interesting.

He looked away, taking a sharp breath.

‚ÄúThe Anderson-Knight bond is the foundation of both our empires. We need strong leaders to uphold that bond. You‚Äôll find Nicolai far more capable than Mila,‚Äù he continued.

There were too many pieces of this puzzle that didn‚Äôt fit. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt concern myself with such matters, but now... this was becoming intriguing. I needed more information.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù I said, watching his reaction.

It wasn‚Äôt the answer he wanted, but he wisely chose not to argue. Nodding reluctantly, he turned to leave.

‚ÄúVery well, then. It‚Äôs settled,‚Äù I said, dismissing him.

As he walked away, a puff of smoke curled from the corner of the wall. My lips twitched. Tut-tut.

I approached the wall quietly, keeping my steps light, but the shadow moved as if sensing me. Rounding the corner, I caught a flash of red disappearing around the next wall. I glanced down at my feet, noting the half-smoked cigarette lying on the ground, its embers fading.

My sweet Mila, you‚Äôre going to get punished.

Turning away, I headed in the opposite direction, knowing exactly where she‚Äôd go. Passing Kate without a word and ignoring Nina mopping by the staircase, I made my way to the back door that led to the pool.

The pool glimmered under the moonlight as I reached the door. There she was, swiftly shutting it and checking over her shoulder to ensure no one had followed her.

Circling the pool, I approached just as she turned around. Her eyes widened in shock when they met mine.

# Chapter 1

Mila POV

‚ÄúDo as your mother says.‚Äù

Stepmother, you mean, I wanted to say. Instead, I stood silently, my lips pressed into a thin line, as my father informed me that I had to go on this so-called weekend trip they had planned with his friend. I know why exactly this trip was planned and I would rather stay away from it.

The plan is to go on a weekend getaway in the vacation house of My father‚Äôs dangerous, mafia friend. Killian Knight. If you‚Äôre smart, you stay out of his way. If you‚Äôre wise, you become his friend‚Äîif you can manage it, that is.

I‚Äôve never met him, only seen photos, but I know enough. And what I know is enough for me to decide that he is too dangerous and too close to my father for comfort. He kills people for a living, and I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôd rather live my life without the constant threat of being snuffed out in my sleep. Besides, I can‚Äôt go on this little ""family-friendly"" trip. I‚Äôll never have an opportunity like this again: three days alone, unsupervised. There are things I need to do and people to expose.

‚ÄúBut Father‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo buts!‚Äù

I refrained from rolling my eyes.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Adeline‚Äîmy dearest stepmother‚Äîwearing a smug expression. She tried her best to suppress it in front of my father. She wants this, she wants to secure her son's position as the next chairperson of Anderson Cooperate Empire and also doesn't let anyone know that she is stealing my rights.

The look on my father‚Äôs face told me it was pointless to argue.

I am so not in the mood to play Happy Family charade.

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù I said, trying my best not to roll my eyes or give a sigh. I think I partially lost in the end.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look like I‚Äôve just killed your cat. This is a family vacation, and Mr. Knight and his wife have so graciously chosen to host us. I don‚Äôt want anyone backing out. We‚Äôll enjoy it like a family,‚Äù he said, his rough voice sounding like he had something stuck in his throat.

‚ÄúYes, my dear, we most certainly will,‚Äù Adeline added, placing her hand over his in what seemed like a loving gesture. My father smiled at her sweetly.

I held back my gag reflex.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll excuse myself, Father.‚Äù

He nodded without looking at me, and I slowly walked out of the study.

The devil‚Äôs spawn‚Äîmy stepbrother‚Äîwas leaning against the wall, waiting with a smirk on his face. I was sure he was there to gloat over my failed attempt to escape this hell trip.

‚ÄúTold you it‚Äôd never work. Father holds the Knights in high regard, and Mr. Knight invited the whole family, little sis,‚Äù he sneered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bold of you to assume I consider you family,‚Äù I shot back.

‚ÄúBe careful, sister. If Father hears you talking like that‚Ä¶‚Äù He put a hand to his chest in mock injury, then his expression darkened as he cocked his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be out of here.‚Äù

I gave him no response to his obvious threat. It was a threat that could very well come true any of these days considering my 21st birthday day is exactly one month away. It will be my end or I will be free from this prison I am forced to call home.

I slipped away down the hallway, past the lobby, and toward the giant staircase leading to the South Wing of the mansion.

This is the Andersons‚Äô ancestral house. My father, Tommen Anderson, is the third-generation Chairman of Anderson Group Of Companies, a multinational company worth over $3 trillion. As his firstborn, I am technically the heir to this corporate empire. But if my stepmother‚Äôs scheming works, my stepbrother might end up taking over the company.

I don't need Anderson Empire or neither I am so stuck up to hold on to the fact what was supposed to be mine and create havoc for it. The truth of my life is the shackle around my feet is this legacy and the only way to free it is to own it.

I remember it quite clearly when it was tied to me.

‚ÄúOnly an Anderson will sit on this chair. You must promise me, Mila,‚Äù my grandfather said when he first made me sit on the chairman‚Äôs chair behind the large, old mahogany desk at Anderson Tech‚Äôs headquarters. I was ten years old and had only recently learned that I was an Anderson.

I still remember him kneeling in front of me, looking me in the eye as I sat in the highest chair at Anderson Tech. His sea green eyes‚ÄîAnderson's eyes, the same eyes I see in the mirror every day‚Äî were cold, just like my father.

‚ÄúYou are the only valid candidate,‚Äù

I didn't know what to think until it became clear that I had just transferred from an iron cage - my orphanage to a golden one - the Anderson Mansion. He was nothing but a jailer.

Two years later, he passed away.

This weekend was supposed to be my lone opportunity to act without Adeline or Nicolas breathing down my neck. Three consecutive days‚Ä¶ but damn her for playing the perfect mother, pretending to care.

For five years, I‚Äôve been careful with every move I make. All anyone knows about me is that I‚Äôm an introverted art history student at New York University with massive social anxiety. A simple girl who thought she was an orphan and is now just \*grateful\* to have a family.

Adeline wants to control my every move. She‚Äôs no fool, though. She knows she has nothing concrete on me. She has always played the part of a concerned mother. I have seen her actual colors. I will not be waiting for that side to come up again.

My plans will have to wait.

I packed my bag, and the next morning, we were on our way. My father and stepmother rode in the Mercedes, while I was stuck with my stepbrother, Nicolas, and half-sister, Francesca, in the BMW.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while since we went to the beach. I‚Äôm excited!‚Äù Francesca‚Äîor Franny, as she insisted we call her‚Äîgushed.

I like her, surprisingly. She‚Äôs not annoying. But I hate her hair‚Äîthe glossy platinum blonde she inherited from her mother. It fell in perfect waves and looked even more angelic paired with the peach beach dress she was wearing. Her eyes were like mine, like my father‚Äôs, like my grandfather‚Äôs. She is Anderson, after all. Probably the only one who didn't look at me like I was a stranger.

I opened my phone, put in my earbuds, and watched a text pop onto the screen.

Are you coming today? \~ J

Later. \~ M

When? \~ J

3 d. \~ M

Damn \~ J

Yeah, yeah. You and I both.

We left the chaotic rhythm of New York City behind, merging onto the highway as the skyline faded in the rearview mirror. The air changed‚Äîcleaner, tinged with salt. A few hours later, we pulled into the Hamptons and parked in front of a grand beach house.

The car came to a halt, and I pulled my earbuds out. As I stepped out, the scent of sea salt filled my senses. If I had to find one redeeming quality about this trip, it was this view. I‚Äôd endure the monotonous gathering just for this.

‚ÄúThis is so beautiful!‚Äù Franny gushed again.

I glanced at the property where we‚Äôd be spending the weekend.

A wide, wraparound porch supported by white pillars overlooked the dunes, while tall, arched windows reflected the fading sunlight. Sprawling gardens surrounded the house, with perfectly manicured lawns stretching toward the sand. Vibrant flower beds lined the walkways, and mature trees cast dappled shadows over a stone fountain at the center of the property. The estate radiated timeless elegance‚Äîa true sanctuary.

Nicolas stepped out of the car, groaning dramatically as he put on his sunglasses.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hot,‚Äù he whined, tugging at the collar of his bright red shirt. A red shirt on a beach trip‚Äîtypical.

I shook my head, slipping my phone and earbuds into my sling bag and shutting the car door. Still, my gaze lingered on the spectacular view. What would it be like to call a place like this your own?

‚ÄúOh, well, we were waiting for you!‚Äù

An elegant woman in a white beach dress stepped onto the porch. She was lean, with an A-line figure and a height that gave her a commanding presence. Her warm smile, framed by red-painted lips, greeted my parents.

‚ÄúKate, thank you for having us,‚Äù Adeline said, performing one of those air kisses high-class women exchange. Kate followed up with a light kiss on my father‚Äôs cheek.

‚ÄúHow are you, Kate? It‚Äôs been a while,‚Äù my father said in what I assumed was his version of a charming tone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm great. Killian and I have been looking forward to this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is my friend‚Äî‚Äù

As if on cue, our host stepped onto the porch.

Khaki pants. A dark blue, fitted shirt that emphasized his broad shoulders and lean, muscular arms. He ran his hands through his hair, dark and tousled, gleaming under the sunlight.

My breath hitched when his eyes locked on mine.

# Chapter 2

Mila POV

Killian Knight had a presence about him. Even as he walked lazily toward us, it felt as though the very air surrounding him was his domain. His aura dared you to challenge his authority‚Äîor look away from him.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs hot!‚Äù Nicolai muttered under his breath.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs married,‚Äù Franny reminded him.

‚ÄúSo what? Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have eyes.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes at Nicolai.

Mr. Knight removed his glasses as he greeted my father. I instinctively stepped back, away from his line of sight. Father introduced Adeline first, then Nicolai, and finally Franny. Killian nodded in acknowledgment, his actions polite, graceful, and measured.

Something crackled in the air, and my gaze moved to his on its own accord. My hand twitched with an unnamed urge, and I quickly shoved it into my pocket, confused. My heart was thundering in my chest. Was it fear?

I reminded myself that our families had shared generations of friendship. I was just as safe here as in my own home‚Äîor so I told myself. I‚Äôd always lived this way, constantly questioning. What was there to be scared of now? I wasn‚Äôt one to back away from challenges, but I had to keep my stance neutral.

‚ÄúAnd who is this?‚Äù That deep, sophisticated voice caressed the air as it directed a question toward me.

‚ÄúThis is Mila,‚Äù my father answered simply and quickly. His indifference was nothing new to me, but I‚Äôd thought‚Äîperhaps hoped‚Äîthat in some corner of his heart, there might be an obligation to pretend otherwise.

‚ÄúMila,‚Äù Killian repeated, a smile gracing his lips as he stepped aside, his gaze fixing on me with unnerving precision. ‚ÄúYour eldest.‚Äù

The glint in his eyes reminded me of a black panther. A jolt of something ran through me, and the air seemed to thin. Mistaking my reaction for fear, I tried to suppress the rush of emotions as he extended his hand toward me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sweet name,‚Äù he said.

Without much thought, I slid my hand into his. His touch was surprisingly warm‚Äîthe kind of warmth you feel sitting by a fire during a snowstorm. Close enough to savor the heat but wary of the burn.

My breath hitched as his large, rough hand enclosed mine, making my own feel small. The sensation sent a shiver down my spine, one I struggled to suppress. My heart raced, and an unfamiliar undercurrent climbed through my nerves. Meeting his eyes again, I gave this feeling a name. It wasn‚Äôt fear. It was desire.

‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù Kate‚Äôs voice broke the spell, and my head snapped toward her.

Hell. What was I doing? I withdrew my hand quickly.

‚ÄúYes, we shall.‚Äù A casual smile lingered on Killian‚Äôs lips as he stepped aside.

‚ÄúThis way, Princess,‚Äù he murmured, so low I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd heard it right.

Kate and the others were already several steps ahead, but Killian walked right beside me. I schooled my expression, but it was difficult to ignore him when I was so hyper-aware of his every move.

‚ÄúNina will show you to your rooms. Once you‚Äôre settled, I‚Äôll give you a tour,‚Äù Kate said.

I didn‚Äôt stop or turn to acknowledge her as Nina, the head of the staff, led us. At the foot of the stairs, Killian halted, and I caught the faint trace of perfume. My pace quickened.

‚ÄúKillian, sweetie,‚Äù a voice called from behind.

Damn it. What was I thinking? He‚Äôs married.

Killian POV

I am bewitched. Mila Anderson cannot be human and real at the same time. Those sea-green siren eyes were meant to drown every soul they landed on. Her dark red hair cascaded to her waist, and the ripped jeans hugged her curves so perfectly it was almost criminal. She clutched the straps of her messenger bag as if her life depended on it, standing behind her family with her shoulders hunched. But when her eyelids fluttered and her gaze met mine‚Äîshe had me, right then and there.

Anderson had never brought his entire family with him before. I‚Äôve met his wife and his stepson, who seems to be his shadow. But I‚Äôve never met his daughters. I‚Äôve only caught a glimpse of the youngest once. This one must be the eldest. After a polite greeting, I finally turned my attention to the object of my interest. Mila.

The moment her hand slipped into mine, I knew there was no going back. The current that surged through me wasn‚Äôt just attraction or desire‚Äîit was something much deeper. Something undeniable.

As Nina showed our guests to their rooms, Mila lingered, trailing behind the others. Halfway up the staircase, she stopped. It would have been too obvious if I followed her, but resisting the pull was damn near impossible. I stayed rooted at the foot of the stairs, my eyes locked on her. She turned slightly, just enough for the corner of her eye to catch mine. I smiled.

She hesitated, almost turning fully toward me, as though she could feel the electric charge between us, pulsing, connecting her to me.

‚ÄúKillian, sweetie,‚Äù Kate‚Äôs voice cut through the moment like a knife. Mila jumped and bolted up the stairs.

‚ÄúDamn you, Katherine,‚Äù I muttered under my breath.

I stalked into the kitchen, where Kate leaned against the counter, watching me warily. Her expression told me she knew exactly what was going through my mind.

‚ÄúIf someone saw you looking at her like that, it wouldn‚Äôt end well,‚Äù she said, her tone cautious but laced with apology.

I folded my arms and tilted my head, smirking. ‚ÄúAnd how exactly am I looking at her?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike you‚Äôre going to devour her,‚Äù she shot back bluntly.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a reminder of what I can or can‚Äôt do,‚Äù I said, my voice sharp.

Kate hesitated before continuing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Anderson‚Äôs daughter. She‚Äôs young. Innocent. Don‚Äôt seduce her. That wouldn‚Äôt be... prudent.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you trying to be my wife now?‚Äù I arched an eyebrow, my tone challenging.

She flinched, unable to meet my gaze. ‚ÄúI have no desire to be,‚Äù she muttered, shaking her head.

I pulled out a chair, the legs scraping noisily against the floor as I sat down. The sound made her flinch again, but only for a moment. She straightened, likely reminding herself of her place. Kate was one of the best in my organization. She couldn‚Äôt afford to show weakness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your friend, Killian,‚Äù she said carefully. ‚ÄúThis could turn into a disaster. Find someone else for your amusement.‚Äù

I leaned back, and her shoulders visibly relaxed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre misunderstanding my intentions,‚Äù I said, my tone deceptively calm.

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? You‚Äôre serious about her? You just met her!‚Äù

I sighed, leaning forward lazily. ‚ÄúKate.‚Äù My voice was soft, but the warning was unmistakable. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget who I am.‚Äù

Her expression shifted instantly. Her posture straightened, the same way all my shadows do in my presence‚Äîalert, ready, and obedient.

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I stood, and she stepped aside instinctively.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt interrupt me again,‚Äù I said as I walked past her.

She gave a sharp nod, and I left without another word.

.

# Chapter 3

Mila's POV

Killian Knight‚Äîthe most dangerous man in the U.S.A. A mafia boss. A contract killer. Married.

¬†I repeated the mantra to myself, willing away the electric charge coursing through me.

My guest room was the last one in the corridor. I thanked Nina, shut the door behind her, and tossed my bag onto the four-poster bed. Pouring myself a glass of water, I downed it in seconds.

Maybe I‚Äôd neglected my body‚Äôs physical needs for far too long. There was no way I could be attracted to danger.

Throwing myself onto the bed, I took a few calming breaths. This had to be some form of shock.

Before I could dwell on it further, my phone rang. It was J.

¬†‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù Her incredulous tone greeted me.

I sighed. ‚ÄúI know. I couldn‚Äôt get out of it. I tried.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in Killian Knight‚Äôs house!‚Äù

¬†I shivered‚Äîfor reasons that had nothing to do with fear.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I replied quietly.

J sighed, clearly worried. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm cool with a lot of things, and if he were anyone else, I‚Äôd say seduce him and take the Anderson empire. But M! He‚Äôs dangerous. Get out of there! We don‚Äôt know what your evil stepmother is planning.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. It would be foolish to say I wasn‚Äôt wary, but Jina didn‚Äôt need to know that. She was worried enough for the both of us.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. No one‚Äôs going to kill me here,‚Äù I scoffed. I hope.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something to take lightly. The man runs a contract killer organization!‚Äù she whisper-hissed.

¬†‚ÄúAnd it makes no sense to kill me here,‚Äù I mimicked her tone.

¬†‚ÄúYou just like to play with fire.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs life without a little danger?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you quoting Harry Potter to me. We have K for that,‚Äù she snapped.

I snickered.

‚ÄúMila.‚Äù Her serious tone stopped me.

¬†‚ÄúHm?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt die.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

I hung up, and the smile slipped from my face. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather be with J and K than here. My stepmother‚Äôs scheming could rot in hell.

Out tour of the house ended by the poolside

As the others retreated inside, I lingered by the poolside. No one noticed as I crouched down, resting my chin on my knees. My heart felt heavy with a sense of lack. My family was always fake, carefully curated for appearances. My father‚Äôs indifference, my stepmother‚Äôs schemes, and my siblings‚Äô endless competition made it impossible to feel anything real. Even Kate‚Äôs warm smiles felt staged, a part of her duty as a host. Everything here was a charade, just like my life.

When would I experience something genuine?

‚ÄúDo you swim?‚Äù

Startled, I nearly tumbled into the water, but a strong arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me back from inches away from breaking the surface.

I gasped as I collided with something solid. The relaxed air thickened around us, and warmth spread from my stomach to my chest. Cinnamon and coffee enveloped my senses as I looked up.

Killian‚Äôs dark eyes met mine, their lethal glint holding me captive.

¬†‚ÄúMr. Knight,‚Äù I whispered.

We both were on the floor. I quickly put some distance between us, standing as he got up smoothly, resting an arm on his knee. The corner of his lips turned up. Why did those lips look so soft and inviting as he looked up at me, his hair falling onto his forehead as he cocked his head to the side? Did he look at everyone like that? Like he knew every secret they held, or he could see straight into the core of them?

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

I nodded. I couldn‚Äôt trust my voice right now. I didn‚Äôt think I had enough air in my lungs to speak, anyway. I should have moved, but my feet stayed rooted there. He got up swiftly, his movements smooth.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to startle you. My apologies,‚Äù he said softly, giving a little nod.

I nodded and stepped back.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I will‚Ä¶‚Äù I pointed to the door leading inside.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt answer.‚Äù

His voice was soft, alluring.

¬†‚ÄúAbout?‚Äù I turned back to look at him in confusion.

‚ÄúDo you swim?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to swim, but it‚Äôs nice here,‚Äù I said. Is telling a certified killer you can‚Äôt swim a good idea? Nope. I needed to get out of his presence. I didn‚Äôt have control of my mind‚Äîor my mouth‚Äîaround him.

‚ÄúMila!‚Äù Franny‚Äôs voice came floating. Thank God for her.

‚ÄúI should go,‚Äù I said, moving quickly. I exhaled the moment I was out of his sight.

Killian's POV

The dinner table was set. All that was left was to choose a wine.

I went to the back of the house and opened the cellar door. My grandfather‚Äôs wine collection was vast, filled with complex and meticulously aged vintage blends. Now, some of my choices were part of the collection too. Under the yellow light of the basement, I walked through the aisle, mulling over my options.

Finally, I made my choice‚ÄîDal Forno Romano Amarone della Valpolicella. Aged meticulously for over a decade, it held notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and a subtle spice.

As I headed back upstairs, wine in hand, I passed the staircase toward the kitchen. The sound of light footsteps made me pause. A glimpse out of the corner of my eye stopped me in my tracks.

And there she was.

Mila stood at the top of the staircase, looking down at her feet. Trails of red hair framed her small, square face, falling from a delicate half-braid. The rest of her hair flowed in soft waves over her shoulders. She wore a simple white, long-sleeved V-neck dress that fell below her knees, its hem tinged with a soft shade of blue.

I smiled. She was simple, yet there was something about the way she carried herself that made her impossible to ignore.

Finally, her gaze lifted, and those sea-green eyes widened when they met mine. I smirked in greeting.

For several seconds, no breath passed between us.

‚ÄúAre you just going to stand there?‚Äù I asked, breaking the silence.

At my question, her feet moved‚Äîonly for her to miss a step.

¬†‚ÄúMila,‚Äù I called her name. Was this the first time I‚Äôd said it out loud? I couldn‚Äôt be sure.

‚ÄúAre you not planning to join us?‚Äù I eased my smile and extended a hand. She looked at it, her expression softening instead of becoming wary, like most people in my presence.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù

She descended a couple of steps before stopping, a small frown appearing as she looked up at me. When she reached the last step, I didn‚Äôt move aside.

Her red lips parted slightly.

‚ÄúCan you drink?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúLegally, no,‚Äù she shrugged.

¬†‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll be 21 in a month.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young.‚Äù

She stepped back a little, breaking our eye contact. ‚ÄúDo I look older to you?‚Äù

She tried to step around me.

¬†‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

I finally moved, letting her pass, the angle bringing her head close to my chin. I leaned toward her ear.

¬†‚ÄúThe most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

She stopped, turning sharply to look at me. Her sea-green eyes weren‚Äôt filled with confusion‚Äîbut awareness. A spark of disbelief flickered in their depths.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be saying that,‚Äù she whispered. She didn‚Äôt look offended or put off.

¬†‚ÄúI like to state facts.‚Äù

Blowing a stray strand of hair from her cheek, I walked away with a teasing smile.

# Chapter 4

Killian's POV¬†

When Tommen asked me about this get-together, I thought he was just following tradition‚Äîreestablishing the Anderson-Knight generational friendship that his grandfather and mine had started. It was meant to ensure the new generation understood the bonds not just of business but of familial relationships. Yet, I‚Äôve never gotten the impression he cared about any of that. Personally, I don‚Äôt either. Only tradition forces me to oblige the Andersons. We meet to discuss business logistics when required, but beyond that, we can barely be called business associates.

I first got to know him during one of these trips. The Hamptons house‚Äîour family‚Äôs vacation home‚Äîis far removed from the world I truly live in. It‚Äôs just another fa√ßade, like everything else in my life. This place has always served this purpose. With no real explanation for his request, I decided to humor him.

After dinner, we stepped into the garden. He lit a cigarette, and I slid my hands into my pockets, standing under the yellow glow of the garden lights. I looked at him‚Äîat the bags under his eyes, barely concealed by the arrogant tilt of his head or the sparkle of his Rolex. My jaw clenched. I despise cigarettes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt allow smoking in my presence,‚Äù I warned.

‚ÄúCome now, Killian,‚Äù he replied dismissively.

I should never have humored this man. I fixed him with a cold stare, watching as he visibly shivered. He tried to hide it, but the arrogant glint vanished from his eyes. Now he was probably remembering exactly where he was and who he was with. The cigarette fell to the ground, and he stubbed it out. I looked away, impatient.

He seemed nervous now, which wasn‚Äôt unusual‚ÄîI‚Äôm used to people reacting that way around me. But his cold eyes reminded me of someone else. Mila. Her wide, shocked eyes and flushed cheeks from our earlier interaction flitted through my mind. I‚Äôd much rather be seeing her.

He wasn‚Äôt speaking, and I was curious about one thing. One person.

‚ÄúTell me about Mila,‚Äù I said.

At dinner, her downcast eyes and slumped shoulders had caught my attention. The woman who had looked me in the eye and all but scolded me earlier wasn‚Äôt the same woman at that table. That woman had seemed more like a shy girl who couldn‚Äôt speak to save her life.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your eldest, yet you‚Äôve never brought her around before.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be bothered by her. Since her mother died, she‚Äôs been reserved. No one‚Äôs managed to draw her out of her shell, and she prefers it that way. Adeline insisted she come,‚Äù he explained.

During her time here, Mila had only spoken to people when politeness demanded it. She wasn‚Äôt close to her stepmother, but from what little I‚Äôd seen, she got along with her younger sister.

Tommen‚Äôs indifference toward his eldest daughter was glaringly obvious. I clenched my fist in my pocket, noting the affection he seemed to reserve for his second wife. Mila‚Äôs lack of interaction with her family made sense, but there was something about the fearlessness in her eyes that felt... different.

‚ÄúI called you out here to talk about my son,‚Äù he finally said, breaking the silence.

My instincts went on high alert as I sensed movement at the corner of a wall about ten feet away. I shifted slightly to keep both Tommen and the shadow in my view. A shoulder peeked out from behind the wall.

‚ÄúYour stepson,‚Äù I corrected, watching his reaction.

‚ÄúMy son needs your support when the board votes for the next chairperson.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would there be a vote?‚Äù

The Anderson succession plan had always been clear: the firstborn Anderson would take the seat. Despite this 70-year-old tradition, which made no distinction between genders, every generation thus far had conveniently produced firstborn sons. By that logic, Mila Anderson should be the next chairperson.

Tommen‚Äôs desire to have his stepson as heir would undoubtedly stir controversy among the board.

‚ÄúYou know the board. They‚Äôre a bunch of outdated fools who cling to tradition, insisting the firstborn Anderson should take the chair,‚Äù he said, clearly agitated.

‚ÄúAnd yet you believe your stepson is a more suitable candidate, even though he‚Äôs not an Anderson?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is an Anderson,‚Äù Tommen said, meeting my eyes for the first time. Interesting.

He looked away, taking a sharp breath.

‚ÄúThe Anderson-Knight bond is the foundation of both our empires. We need strong leaders to uphold that bond. You‚Äôll find Nicolai far more capable than Mila,‚Äù he continued.

There were too many pieces of this puzzle that didn‚Äôt fit. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt concern myself with such matters, but now... this was becoming intriguing. I needed more information.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù I said, watching his reaction.

It wasn‚Äôt the answer he wanted, but he wisely chose not to argue. Nodding reluctantly, he turned to leave.

‚ÄúVery well, then. It‚Äôs settled,‚Äù I said, dismissing him.

As he walked away, a puff of smoke curled from the corner of the wall. My lips twitched. Tut-tut.

I approached the wall quietly, keeping my steps light, but the shadow moved as if sensing me. Rounding the corner, I caught a flash of red disappearing around the next wall. I glanced down at my feet, noting the half-smoked cigarette lying on the ground, its embers fading.

My sweet Mila, you‚Äôre going to get punished.

Turning away, I headed in the opposite direction, knowing exactly where she‚Äôd go. Passing Kate without a word and ignoring Nina mopping by the staircase, I made my way to the back door that led to the pool.

The pool glimmered under the moonlight as I reached the door. There she was, swiftly shutting it and checking over her shoulder to ensure no one had followed her.

Circling the pool, I approached just as she turned around. Her eyes widened in shock when they met mine.

# best Vietnamese Coffee Gift Set 2025: Delight A Loved One

## Key Features Analysis

The Vietnamese coffee gift set offers a comprehensive introduction to the traditional brewing method and flavors of Vietnam.

**Phin Filter:** At the heart of the set is the traditional phin filter, a small, typically stainless steel device used to brew individual cups of coffee. It's a gravity-driven brewing method that allows for a slow and intentional extraction of the coffee's oils and aromas. The phin included usually consists of a filter chamber, a pressing plate (gravity insert), and a lid to retain heat during the brewing process. The dimensions average around 3 inches in diameter making it suitable for single servings of coffee.

**Robusta Coffee Beans:** these gift sets commonly include a selection of Robusta coffee beans, sourced directly from Vietnam. Robusta beans are known for their bold,strong flavor,higher caffeine content,and slightly bitter taste,characteristic of authentic Vietnamese coffee. A typical set might include 8-12 ounces of whole bean or pre-ground coffee packaged in a resealable bag to maintain freshness. the roasting level often leans towards a dark roast to enhance the intense flavor profile.

**Condensed Milk:** A staple ingredient in Vietnamese coffee, condensed milk adds sweetness and a creamy texture that complements the strong coffee.The gift set generally includes a can or pouch of sweetened condensed milk, usually sized around 10-14 ounces, providing enough for numerous servings. The condensed milk is crucial for creating the traditional ""Ca Phe Sua Da"" ‚Äì Vietnamese iced coffee with milk.

**vietnamese Coffee Guide:** Many premium gift sets include a guide or booklet providing information about the history, culture, and brewing techniques of Vietnamese coffee. This guide often includes step-by-step instructions for using the phin filter, recipe suggestions for different variations of vietnamese coffee, and insights into the regional differences in coffee preparation.

**Spoon and Cup:** To complete the brewing experience, some gift sets feature a traditional Vietnamese coffee spoon, typically made of stainless steel, and a small ceramic or glass coffee cup. The spoon is designed for stirring in the condensed milk and enjoying the coffee, while the cup‚Äôs size is adapted to the standard serving size of the robust Vietnamese coffee. Cup sizes typically hold around 4-6 ounces.

## Core Benefits

the Vietnamese coffee gift set offers several compelling benefits for both the giver and the recipient.

**Cultural Immersion:** This gift set allows the recipient to experience an authentic slice of Vietnamese culture by providing the tools and ingredients to prepare coffee in the traditional way. It goes beyond simply drinking coffee; it's about participating in a ritual and appreciating the history and traditions associated with Vietnamese coffee culture.

**Unique and Bold Flavor Profile:** Robusta coffee beans, central to the set, deliver a distinctive flavor profile markedly different from the more common Arabica beans.The strong, bold, and slightly bitter taste, perfectly balanced with the sweetness of condensed milk, offers an exciting and memorable coffee experience. This is a welcome change for those bored with ordinary coffee options.

**Mindful Brewing Experience:** Unlike automated coffee machines, the phin filter requires a slow, deliberate brewing process that encourages mindfulness and patience. The gradual dripping of coffee through the filter offers a moment of calm and allows the drinker to appreciate the aroma and anticipation of their coffee. This contrasts the rush often associated with modern coffee consumption.

**Customizable Strength and Sweetness:** The process of brewing coffee with a phin allows for control over the strength and concentration of the coffee. Additionally,the amount of condensed milk added can be adjusted to individual preference,giving the drinker the power to tailor their coffee to their ideal taste.

## FAQs Section

Yes, most reputable Vietnamese coffee gift sets contain a detailed instruction manual or guide demonstrating how to properly use the Phin filter. These instructions often include visual aids and step-by-step directions, making the brewing process approachable for beginners.

**Can I use other types of coffee beans with the Phin filter?**
While Robusta beans are the traditional choice for Vietnamese coffee due to their bold flavor, you can experiment with other types of coffee beans in the Phin filter. Though, keep in mind that Arabica beans, being less strong, might require adjustments in the amount of coffee used to achieve a similar strength.**Is the phin filter easy to clean?**
Yes, the Phin filter is designed for easy cleaning. The filter components easily separate and can be washed with warm water and soap. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, which can damage the stainless-steel finish.Proper cleaning ensures the longevity of the filter.

**What is the shelf life of Robusta coffee beans included in the set?**
The shelf life of Robusta coffee beans largely depends on how they are stored. Whole bean coffee will generally stay fresh longer than pre-ground coffee. When stored in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture, whole bean Robusta coffee can typically last for up to six months, while pre-ground coffee is best consumed within two to three months.

# Chapter 1 My Wife Has Violent Tendencies

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story‚Äîsomething about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation‚Äîuntil she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest‚Äîhis childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton‚Äîthe admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical‚Äîsaving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I‚Äî""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look‚Äîone that screamed, 'See? You lost again, Audrey. I'm the one Clayton cares about above all.'

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they'd look like a perfect family.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

'What if he weren't here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton's too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing her hero.'

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn't going to keep tolerating this broken marriage‚Äînot for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she'd have to sue him, and she knew she'd be at a disadvantage. But she wasn't scared. It was hard, but it didn't mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a ""real"" couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition‚Äîshe'd buy her own house with her own money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn't huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She'd barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she'd been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn't spend a dime of Clayton's money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself‚Äîonly to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building's property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, ""Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.""

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, ""I'm the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That's trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I'm holding them and this property company accountable.""

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style‚Äîwhite walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn't have enough budget to renovate it, but it was clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn't move in yet.

But now, they really couldn't move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once-pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere‚Äîgod knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton's place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

\*\*\*\*\*

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton's good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, ""She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You'll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she's currently fine. Still, don't take it lightly.""

""Thank you, doctor."" Valerie's eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, ""Clay, I don't know what I would've done without you.""

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie's heart dropped, and she thought, 'No. I can't let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.'

Through tears, she said, ""This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left Luna outside like that. But you know what Audrey did last time.

""Luna already has autism, and she's still scared from that scene. I didn't have a choice but to leave her in the living room.""

# Chapter 4 Audrey's Fight Back

""You know Luna is my whole world,"" Valerie sobbed, covering her face with both hands. ""Back then, I took beatings just to protect her. If anything happens to her now because of my carelessness, I won't forgive myself.""

Hearing her cry, Clayton felt a sudden wave of irritation rising in his chest.

He said, ""The doctor said she's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Honestly, getting her out of that mess is already brave. I've got stuff to deal with. You stay here and look after Luna, okay?""

A bad feeling crept up Valerie's spine. She asked cautiously, ""Are you worried Audrey will be mad? I can take Luna and leave. I swear we won't cause you any trouble.""

""You don't have to leave,"" Clayton replied, rubbing his temples. ""It's something at the firm.""

The real reason Clayton had Audrey sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital on her birthday was because she cut Valerie's hand. Valerie's reputation was just a minor cause.

He thought getting Audrey out of the picture would calm Valerie down, and then maybe she'd agree to drop the charges. If Audrey ended up with a record, she'd be blacklisted from half the job market.

Clayton had connections at Ashwood‚Äîhis law firm handled some of their legal affairs. He personally asked the manager to put Audrey in a quiet, nicer section of the hospital and told him she just needed time to cool off.

""Audrey is not the kind to hold grudges,"" Clayton added absentmindedly.

Valerie almost lost control of her expression. She opened her mouth to say more, but Clayton had already turned around and left the ward.

Carson, waiting outside the ward, walked down the stairs with Clayton. Carson said, ""Look, man, don't take this the wrong way, but Valerie's got a strange look in her eyes when she sees you.""

Clayton shot Carson a look that could freeze hell. He warned, ""Say that again, and you're not my friend anymore.""

""Alright, alright."" Carson raised his hands in surrender. ""I'm done. Just keep your eyes open. Audrey's not your match, but she's been really good to you.""

Clayton's eyes flickered, then he turned around and left the hospital. Carson stood there watching him leave and shaking his head.

None of the guys in their circles planned to get married, and they definitely hadn't supported Clayton's impulsive marriage just to spite his family for arranging an alliance for him.

But Audrey's devotion after they got married made a few of them reconsider the whole bachelor lifestyle.

When Clayton brought Valerie back into the picture and started putting her first in everything, Carson warned him not to keep Audrey in the dark.

On Audrey's birthday, Clayton had planned to finally come clean. But they were a bit late, and the accident happened.

Once Valerie was sure the two men had left, the soft worry and guilt drained from her face in an instant. Her whole expression turned cold as she looked at Luna lying on the bed.

She muttered, ""Useless. Couldn't you have eaten a few more chestnuts? You are in no danger. Clay didn't even care to stay.""

Luna's small frame shrank into itself. Her head was too big for her frail body. She stared at her mother, her eyes wide with fear and confusion.

Just minutes after Clayton walked out, Audrey stepped into the hospital.

Carson spotted Audrey and assumed she was there to give Valerie a hard time. He was about to call Clayton when he overheard two nurses whispering nearby.

The first nurse said, ""Oh my, no one can stop them? Beating people is illegal.""

Another nurse replied, ""A 10-year-old or so boy died there last year. His folks spent six months in court. In the end, they called it an accident and got a little compensation.""

Carson walked over and said behind them, ""You two work here or just gossip for a living?""

The nurses giggled upon seeing Carson. He was kind of a big deal around here, returning from abroad with a flashy resume.

The first nurse explained, ""We were talking about Ashwood Mental Hospital, Dr. Wilson. That place is hell. I don't get why some parents send their kids there just to get them beat up.""

The other nurse added, ""The owners have people backing them. If someone gets hurt or even dies, they just throw money at it. That woman had bruises all over. Hope she gets some justice.""

Carson's brows furrowed upon hearing that. He knew Clayton had sent Audrey to Ashwood.

Lots of kids had behavioral issues, tech addictions, and attitude problems. It was said Ashwood could straighten them out.

Carson didn't think giving troubled teens a little tough love was a big deal. As far as he was concerned, a place like Ashwood Mental Hospital had its uses. Plus, Clayton knew the manager there, and Audrey was an adult, so surely they'd treat her differently.

""You can't write off a whole institution just because of a few bad stories. If it exists, there's a reason,"" Carson said before heading back to his office.

That conversation made him forget all about calling Clayton.

Meanwhile, Audrey sat in a park, holding her injury report. The staff at Ashwood didn't dare beat her outright, but they played all kinds of mental games and messed with her food.

When she caught wind of her release, she used a bathroom break to rough herself up a bit. The bruises looked terrifying but weren't actually deep.

She waited until nearly 4 p.m. before spotting a familiar figure rushing by. Audrey stood up and called out, ""Mr. Sanchez.""

Leo Sanchez, Ashwood's manager, was in his forties with a beer belly. He strode like he had something urgent to do. He glanced at Audrey and instantly looked annoyed.

""Audrey? What do you want?"" he snapped, not even bothering to call her ""Mrs. Patel"".

Audrey crooked her finger at him, signaling for him to sit on the bench.

Leo's face turned grim. He snapped, ""If you've got something to say, spit it out. I'm busy.""

""Are you rushing to Little Dreamers Preschool to pick up your lovechild?"" Audrey raised her voice.

Leo's face turned an ugly shade of red. His eyes were filled with panic and fury.

No one was supposed to know about the kid he had with his mistress, but he didn't know how Audrey found out.

The park was full of parents with their kids. If anyone heard that, word would spread fast, and he couldn't risk that kind of heat falling on his son.

Grinding his teeth, Leo walked over and sat stiffly on the bench. ""Now, talk.""

Audrey waved the medical report and tossed it onto his lap. ""While I was locked up at Ashwood, I was abused‚Äîphysically and emotionally‚Äîby your staff. I want compensation for medical bills, nutrition recovery, and psychological damage.""

Leo's eyes nearly popped out at the number‚Äî150,000 dollars. He growled, ""This is extortion.""

Audrey let out a cold chuckle. ""Call it what you want. If you think I'm bluffing, I'll go straight to the cops or the press. You pick.""

A smirk flickered in Leo's eyes. He knew Clayton's law firm represented Ashwood. Clayton had personally called to make sure Audrey ""learned her lesson"". He was sure that Clayton would help her with the lawsuit.

""Does Mr. Patel know what you're up to?"" Leo asked.

Audrey thought, 'Trying to use Clayton against me? I used to care about his feelings, but now, I'd skin him alive if I could.'

She folded her arms with a sneer. ""Did Clayton also tell you I've got violent tendencies? Kinda like being legally insane."" Her voice dropped lower. ""So tell me, what would happen if I lost my mind and stabbed your son? Who would the law blame then?""

Leo's face drained of color. Audrey's file did say she had a history of extreme behavior. His staff also reported she was stubborn as hell. When they locked her in solitary, she still refused to admit anything.

Leo thought bitterly, 'This woman is really insane. Ashwood only exists because my father-in-law pulled strings. If they find out I've got a mistress and a secret kid, I'm toast.

'Valerie's about to become Mrs. Patel, anyway. Once the divorce goes through and Audrey's out of the picture, I'll stash my kid somewhere and deal with her then.'

# Chapter 5 I'm Her Family

""Fine. I'll pay your medical bills."" Leo said through clenched teeth.

Audrey tossed a pen onto his lap and said, ""Sign it. Can't have you crying later that I blackmailed you.""

Leo hunched over the paper, his expression murderous. But when he looked up again, his face had smoothed out. He then transferred the 150,000 dollars to her account without a word.

The second Leo stepped out of the park, Audrey sent a message to Leo's wife.

She sneered to herself, 'Think you'll come back for revenge? Keep dreaming. That money wasn't hush money. It was compensation. What Ashwood does behind closed doors will all be shown to the public.'
