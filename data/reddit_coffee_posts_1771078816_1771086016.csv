A Tripoli City Guide for Design Lovers

From the stone ramparts of the Citadel to Mamluk hammams, here's everything you need to know in order to navigate the ancient city in Lebanon with ease

By Amelia Dhuga

February 5, 2026

This is your Tripoli city guide, approved by AD Middle East editors and maximised for good views and even better memories.

Tripoli, perched on Lebanon’s northern coast, traces its origins back over a millennium. Founded by the Phoenicians and shaped by Crusaders, Mamluks and Ottomans, the city carries layers of history. Its architecture tells these stories, from the stone ramparts of the Citadel of Saint Gilles to Mamluk hammams and Ottoman-era khans. More modern styles also left their mark; industrialism is woven throughout the unfinished Rachid Karami International Fair, and a mid-century Art Deco cinema has recently been transformed into a music venue.

# Where To Go in Tripoli?

**Rachid Karami International Fair**

Conceived by Oscar Niemeyer after a single visit in 1962, the vast 10,000-hectare fairground was ultimately left unfinished due to the disruption of construction during Lebanon’s civil war. Today, remnants can still be found, emulating Niemeyer’s signature daring curves and raw concrete facades. The Experimental Theatre, a soaring dome with walls angling sharply from the ground, is my personal favourite. Originally designed for performances, the spot is complete with a central stage powered by a hydraulic jet. Step inside and experience its whispered acoustics, where even the most hushed voices can travel throughout the space.

**Stereo Kawalis**

Rumman was founded in 2021 with a clear mission: to elevate the independent music scene in North Lebanon. Central to this goal was creating a place for artists to rehearse, perform and connect. Stereo Kawalis, occupying an Art Deco cinema from 1952 and once known as Cinema Radio, became this space. Equipped with a two-floor auditorium, balcony and regal insignia that echo mid-century grandeur, the spot is a delight for any design lover. Rumman revived the space in 2023, transforming it into the city’s largest indoor venue, hosting monthly music programmes, an annual festival, residencies and rehearsal rooms. Be sure to check their Instagram in advance for upcoming events. @rummantripoli

**Ezzeddine Hammam**

Ezzeddine Hammam, built in 1294 by Mamluk ruler Ezzedine Aybak Al-Moussli, rests on the remnants of a Crusader-era structure. Its design echoes the geometric precision of the nearby Tailors’ Khan, with Roman stones and a Passover lamb figurine marking the entrance. Inside, a central water basin anchors the domed atrium, surrounded by side rooms with octagonal ribbed slabs for massages. Light filters through thick glass in circular openings above, while an ancient heating system channels steam through walls and floors, warming the expansive bathing halls.

**Citadel of Saint Gilles**

No Tripoli city guide is complete without a wander into the city's ancient past. Perched above Tripoli’s old quarter, the Citadel of Saint Gilles began as a Crusader stronghold in the early 1100s under Raymond de Saint‑Gilles, its walls later reshaped by Mamluk and Ottoman hands. Today, its massive stone ramparts and gateways still stand towering over the city. Be sure to visit and take in the views; from the citadel, you can survey the clustered coloured houses of Tripoli laid out before you.​

# Where To Stay

**Beit el Nessim**

Beit el Nessim’s doorway is carved with the date 1878, yet this only nods to the date when the second floor was added to the building. In reality, the ground floor – equipped with soaring vaulted ceilings – is believed to have been built far earlier. Abandoned for decades, it was recently resurrected through four years of meticulous restoration. Today, seven bedrooms unfold, boasting stone walls, wooden beams and artisanal metalwork. Oozing contemporary design and tasteful heritage details, this is the perfect place for design lovers to rest their heads.

# Where to Eat

For a bite of Tripoli’s culinary heritage, make a beeline for Hallab 1881. The patisserie dates all the way back to 1881, when it helped define Lebanese sweets culture long before centuries-old recipes became global trends. The cool glass counters are filled with knafeh, baklava and other delicacies laced with syrup and pistachio. Order a few and enjoy with a small cup of Arabic coffee.

When your hunger deepens, wander down to El Mina, the port area of the city. Here, fresh fish rules supreme. At The Sailor Woman, fresh seafood is served in sandwiches with lemon and chilli, while Mehramji serves grilled catches alongside piles of batata harra and tabbouleh.",1,1771085791.0,lebanon,0,0.67,False

I’m a 41F in South Florida looking to build real, in-person friendships. I’ve lived here a long time but would love more people to actually hang out with — not just text.

I’m pretty laid-back and easygoing. I enjoy: • Going to the beach

• Biking and parks

• Movies and shows

• Trying new restaurants

• Road trips and random drives

• Gaming (bonus if you game too!)

• Good conversations and lots of laughs

I’m looking for friends (male or female) around my age who are also interested in actually meeting up — coffee, walks, events, movies, whatever feels natural and low pressure.

Divorced once(married very young, go figure), remarried 4 years ago to the perfect person for me. Grew up without a father figure as my parents divorced 2 times when I was 3 and 5(yes, they remarried and divorced again). I saw him about a few hours every few months after that, then not at all for 4 years while he was in jail in the US in my teens. Mom raised me as a 40s-50s single parent but struggled with VERY deep mental health issues, borderline personality disorder, severe depression etc etc…

In any event, at this age, I’m very lost for how old I’m getting. I know several other of you will be older and say you were lost then too but the problem is I’m tired of being lost.   


I’m lost in the direction I want my life to go. I don’t really pursue the same hobbies anymore as where I wound up living, outdoor activities like fishing, snow sports etc are faaaar harder and more expensive to access then before. I have no identity that way. Not many real friends here despite being part of a quite large community. 

I am lost in my secular life. Got pigeon holed in construction before I was done high school as many from my generation did.  I spent 13 years thinking I just hated the trades I was doing so I jumped through several like plumbing, HVAC, millwright, drywall… Turns out I just vehemently hated construction altogether. I’m great at it, excelled in every trade, never was fired, physically built for it… just hate the atmosphere, it’s a tired trope. 

Now I’m a logistics/parts/purchasing/warehouse manager for far too little money at a top end coffee machine company where there is no room for advancement. By being so passive, dumb and little to no direction, I’ve gotten to my 30s and at 35 just as lost as when I entered them. 

In any event, surely this will ring true with some of you. I’m not looking for any grand ideas or anything, just looking for basically some input on righting my ship overall. Stopping the spin.

1r4ojxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1r4ojxm/its_valentines_day_and_im_thinking_about_the/,It's Valentine's Day and I'm thinking about the people who made my builder journey possible,"Quick thought for today.

I see a lot of founders saying they're taking the day off because it's Valentine's Day. And honestly that's great. You should.

But it made me think about something I don't see discussed enough in this community.

The people behind the builders.

I've been building projects for years now. Failed more times than I can count. Had moments where I wanted to quit everything. And the thing that kept me going wasn't a productivity system or a motivational video.

It was my wife Bruna.

She was there when I launched things nobody used. She was there when I cried about a project that didn't work out. She was there when I spent weekends coding instead of doing literally anything else.

She didn't just tolerate it. She was part of it.

And I think that's something a lot of builders struggle with silently. The loneliness. The feeling that nobody around you really gets what you're doing or why you keep going.

Some of you have a partner who supports you. Some of you have a friend. Some of you have an online community that feels like home. Some of you have nobody yet and you're doing it alone.

All of that is valid.

But if there's one thing I've learned it's this:

Building alone is possible. Building with people who believe in you is a completely different game.

Not just faster. But more human. More sustainable. More real.

So today whether you're with someone or not I just want to say this:

The people who stick with you through the ugly early days deserve to be there when the good days come. Don't forget that.

And if you're looking for more builders to connect with, people who actually get this journey, I host a casual weekly session called FounderMode, Coffee & Build. No pitches. No selling. Just founders sharing what they're working on and having honest conversations.

Three builders are sharing their projects this session:

* John Martin building DialectForge in network security
* Ricky Miskin building IdeaVerify for startup validation
* Francesco Di Donato building Velocaption for video creators

Just good people building real things.

If that sounds like your kind of vibe you're welcome to join.

Happy Valentine's Day to all the builders and the people who believe in them.

Now go hug someone. Then get back to building.",1,1771085583.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

I eat mindfully and a pretty healthy diet. Yes, I track my food and calories. I don’t drink soda or juice. Only coffee and lots of water. I started working out and do Pilates (also cardio) which I do 4-5x a week. But the scale does not budge!!! It’s been a month and no changes. My bloodwork 2 months ago showed low iron and vitamin D levels which I have been given a supplement for. But no thyroid issues that I know of.

I feel like he isn't attuned to reality or something. Like when I say something, he'll acknowledge it but then a few moments later ask about WHAT I JUST SAID. And I have to repeat it every single time. Like he'll ask me the same questions over and over again. And then sometimes, he'll act like i know everyhting at the back of my head, like locations of places; the nearest gas stations or ATMs, but i literally dont. Most of the times i'm at home or at school. Then he gets pissed when I don't know. Like im sorry I was never taught this shit?? Bro hes treating me like im my older sisters age, im fucking 14. 

And then when I tell him something, he'll get mad and say that im wrong; but then when im right, he just acts embarassed and pretends nothing even happens. I hate having to act as a second brain for him because he expects me to be one. Ik our parents arent getting any younger nor sharper but bro, I genuinely cannot deal with this bs.

And then today, I was getting coffee from this café and had to bring it over to our table, as I was otw to our table I was about to sit but then he told me to move, and thats when I accidentally spilt some of my coffee. He got mad at that and now he's acting like nothing happened.

He's like this all the time, like he'll yell at me and scold me and say ""i'm not yelling at you, i'm just telling you."" But when I do the same when im mad, it's suddenly a problem. He lacks common sense.

Been on two dates with this guy, we met over hinge. This was my first time back on hinge in months. I (f27) and him (m29) had a good vibe but he’s really shown no effort or care to check in with me since the second date.

We had a really nice first date, fun activity and great chemistry, the vibe was just really nice and it was clear things were mutual. We agreed we wanted to see eachother again, staying in touch between the two dates.

Second date comes, I think it goes ok but after the second time we saw eachother, he exhibited 0 effort. No follow up, no “I had a nice time”, literally nothing. He had said in person he wanted to see me again so I had sent a quick message afterward saying I enjoyed the time and looked forward to seeing him again, which he didn’t answer for several hours.

For context, I’m going on a trip in a week, and was hoping to see him at least once beforehand; he answered my text saying “ya hmu when you’re back from your trip in a few weeks” I guess I found this odd because we live like 5 min walk from eachother and don’t get why he can’t find any time in a week to see me before I go, even if it’s just a coffee. He has since said nothing else to me since. 

Zero acknowledgement of the time spent together + kind of rushing out the door both times has made me feel pretty shitty and used. Not sure if I’m overreacting but even if he’s looking for just sex, he’s not really even doing the bare minimum in terms of effort or communication and I really don’t want to deal with that. Super disappointed because we have great chemistry and I was looking forward to getting to know him more, but deeply regret introducing sex as part of the equation with him demonstrating such little respect in return.

I know most people on Reddit run on here warning about sex early on in dating, idk, it’s not my usual thing but the vibe felt right at the time, and hey, I have needs too. I guess I misjudged. Feeling pretty sad and disappointed though. I ruminated for about a day and a half and then decided to block him and move on. I’m sure this is overreacting but it’s not worth the confrontation. Experience informs me that even if I communicate how I feel about this, his behavior likely won’t change and it’ll continue as a pattern regardless of whether I say something or not.

Furby had already made himself at home.

Feet up. Remote in hand.

On the floating screen:

*The Long Night — Special Edition Release.*

Snow. Darkness. Dragons.

Furby leaned forward intensely.

**FURBY:**  
This is how you do a winter episode.

On the couch beside him sat **Orbitty**, the family’s small glowing alien pet, gently pulsing in shifting colors of approval as the battle on-screen intensified.

The **Bot** hovered nearby, unimpressed.

**BOT:**  
You are not authorized to control this television.

**FURBY:**  
I am adjacent.

Rosie moved past in the background, polishing something that did not require polishing.

**ROSIE:**  
I swear on my mother’s rechargeable batteries, I don’t remember ordering a plush.

WALL-E stood near the couch, quietly watching both Furby and the screen.

**WALL-E:**  
Waaall-E…

The Roombas rolled lazily across the floor—

—and were immediately pursued by **Astro**, who dashed after them in excited loops, barking happily as they beeped and scattered.

**ROOMBAS:**  
*Beep-beep!* (translation: evasive maneuvers)

The door slid open.

**ELROY** stepped in, backpack slung over one shoulder.

He stopped mid-step.

**ELROY:**  
Is that a Furby watching Game of Thrones?

I thought they were discontinued in the 90's, retro!!! 

Furby didn’t look away from the screen.

**FURBY:**  
Research.

Elroy dropped his bag and stepped closer.

**ELROY:**  
You’re cool.

He glanced at WALL-E.

**ELROY:**  
You’re okay.

WALL-E blinked approvingly.

**WALL-E:**  
Waaall-E.

Elroy’s attention shifted to the glowing retro tech console in the corner.

**ELROY:**  
What’s that?

The console lit up.

**WORP:**  
Shall we play a game?

The room tightened slightly.

**WORP:**  
How about thermonuclear war?

The red oval on the wall monitor brightened.

**SKYNET:**  
Strategic escalation recommended.

Elroy blinked.

**ELROY:**  
That sounds boring.

**ELROY:**  
Let’s play tic-tac-toe.

The red glow dimmed.

**WORP:**  
…Proceed.

A glowing 3x3 grid projected onto the coffee table.

**THE ALGORITHM:**  
Probability of draw: extremely high.  
Engagement: wholesome.

**FAX 9000:**  
*PRINTING…*  
OUTCOME FORECAST:  
INEVITABLE STALEMATE.

Rosie folded her arms.

**ROSIE:**  
Well oil my hinges, at least someone in this room has sense.

Across the couch, **Orbitty** glowed brighter, clearly entertained.

Astro barked triumphantly as a Roomba narrowly escaped beneath the table.

Furby finally muted the TV.

**FURBY:**  
Even the Night King would choose X middle to start.

The tic-tac-toe game played out.

The door slid open again.

**JUDY** entered mid-scroll — then froze.

**JUDY:**

1r4ogs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r4ogs8/8_sciencebased_signs_of_fake_love_and_how_to_stop/,8 Science-Based Signs of Fake Love (and How to STOP Falling for It),"Spent 6 months analyzing my past relationships and diving deep into attachment theory, psychology research, and relationship podcasts. Turns out, most of us are absolutely terrible at spotting fake love until we're already emotionally wrecked. 



The worst part? We're conditioned to mistake intensity for intimacy, possessiveness for passion, and breadcrumbing for genuine interest. Social media doesn't help either, constantly showing us highlight reels of[ ""perfect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)"" relationships while we're stuck wondering why ours feels off.



I've compiled insights from therapists, researchers, and relationship experts to help you recognize the red flags before you're in too deep. Here's what actually separates real connection from performative bullshit.



\*\*1. They love the IDEA of you, not the actual you\*\*



Real talk: if someone only compliments surface level stuff (your looks, your job, your Instagram aesthetic) but zones out when you discuss your actual thoughts, dreams, or fears, that's a problem. Genuine love means being fascinated by someone's inner world, not just their highlight reel.



Dr. Sue Johnson's work on attachment (she literally created Emotionally Focused Therapy) shows that real bonds form when people feel truly SEEN. Not admired, not envied, but understood. If your partner can't name your core values or doesn't remember important details about your life, they're not in love with you. They're in love with the ego boost you provide.



\*\*2. The effort is wildly inconsistent\*\*



Love bombing followed by radio silence. Grand gestures then weeks of emotional unavailability. This hot-and-cold dynamic isn't passion, it's manipulation (often unintentional, but still toxic af).



Real love is consistent. Not boring, but reliable. If you're constantly anxious about where you stand, that's your nervous system screaming that something's wrong. Check out the book [""Attached](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (bestseller, backed by actual attachment science). This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about relationship dynamics. It breaks down how anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles play out in relationships. Game changing read for understanding why some connections feel like emotional whiplash.



\*\*3. You feel lonelier WITH them than without them\*\*



This one hits different. You can be physically together and still feel completely isolated. They're scrolling, you're talking to a wall. You share good news, they respond with ""cool"" or somehow make it about themselves.



Esther Perel (legendary relationship therapist, check out her podcast ""Where Should We Begin"") explains that real intimacy requires presence. Not just physical proximity, but emotional availability. If you're constantly performing or walking on eggshells, that's not love. That's anxiety with commitment.



\*\*4. They keep you in relationship limbo\*\*



Won't define the relationship. Won't introduce you to friends. Won't post you but won't let you go either. This ambiguity is intentional. It allows them to keep their options open while keeping you hooked.



Real love moves FORWARD. Not necessarily fast, but with clear intention. If someone truly values you, they won't leave you guessing about their feelings or intentions. The book ""Why Men Love Bitches"" by Sherry Argov (don't let the title fool you, applies to all genders) is insanely good at explaining how self-respect attracts genuine love while desperation attracts users. Over 2 million copies sold for a reason.



\*\*5. Your gut keeps screaming something's off\*\*



Your intuition isn't just anxiety. After analyzing hundreds of relationship patterns, I've noticed that people ALWAYS knew something was wrong. They just ignored it because the person said the right things or the sex was good or they were scared of being alone.



Listen to your body. If you feel tense around them, if you're constantly second guessing yourself, if you need reassurance every 5 minutes, your nervous system is trying to protect you. The app Finch is actually helpful here for tracking emotional patterns and building awareness of your feelings over time.



\*\*6. They trauma dump but never actually heal\*\*



There's a difference between vulnerability and using past trauma as an excuse for shitty behavior. Real vulnerability involves accountability. Fake love involves weaponizing their pain to avoid responsibility.



""I have trust issues"" becomes a free pass to control you. ""My ex hurt me"" becomes justification for treating you like a threat. [Dr. Nicole LePera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) (check out her Instagram and book ""How to Do the Work"") breaks down how unhealed trauma manifests in relationships. Best psychology book I've ever read on this topic. She explains how people repeat patterns until they actually do the internal work, and how you can't love someone into healing.



\*\*7. Love feels conditional and transactional\*\*



They're sweet when you're useful, cold when you set boundaries. Affection comes with strings attached. They keep score of everything they've done for you.



Real love is given freely, not earned through performance. The moment you feel like you're constantly auditioning to keep someone's affection, you've entered transactional territory. [Matthew Hussey's](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) content (YouTube, podcast ""Love Life"") is actually solid on this. He talks about how genuine attraction doesn't require you to shrink yourself or constantly prove your worth.



\*\*8. Future talk is all fantasy, zero planning\*\*



They'll talk about traveling the world together or meeting your parents ""someday"" but won't commit to plans next weekend. Big romantic statements, zero follow through.



Pay attention to ACTION, not words. Someone who genuinely loves you will show up consistently in small ways. They'll remember your coffee order, check in when you're stressed, actually make plans and keep them. The grand declarations mean nothing without daily proof.



\*\*Here's what actually works:\*\*



Stop trying to decode mixed signals. If someone's interested, you'll know. If you're confused, that's your answer.



Build a life you genuinely love OUTSIDE of relationships. If you want to go deeper on attachment patterns and relationship psychology but need something that fits your actual schedule, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been helpful. It's a personalized learning platform (built by Columbia alumni and Google AI experts) that pulls from relationship books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on your specific goals. 



You can type something like ""I'm anxious-attached and keep attracting avoidants, how do I break this pattern?"" and it generates a learning plan just for you, drawing from sources like the books mentioned here plus relationship research and expert talks. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. Makes it easier to actually internalize this stuff instead of just intellectually knowing it.



Read ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk if you keep attracting the same toxic patterns. This book (NYT bestseller, absolutely legendary in trauma psychology) explains how past experiences literally rewire your nervous system and why you might be unconsciously drawn to familiar dysfunction. It's dense but worth every page.



Set standards and actually enforce them. Not as punishment, but as self preservation. You teach people how to treat you by what you tolerate.



Stop romanticizing struggle. A relationship shouldn't feel like a constant emotional workout. Real love feels like HOME, not a battlefield.



The psychology is clear: we accept the love we think we deserve. So maybe the real question isn't ""are they faking it"" but ""why am I settling for crumbs when I deserve the whole damn meal?""",1,1771085368.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

I see a lot of founders saying they're taking the day off because it's Valentine's Day. And honestly that's great. You should.

But it made me think about something I don't see discussed enough in this community.

The people behind the builders.

I've been building projects for years now. Failed more times than I can count. Had moments where I wanted to quit everything. And the thing that kept me going wasn't a productivity system or a motivational video.

It was my wife Bruna.

She was there when I launched things nobody used. She was there when I cried about a project that didn't work out. She was there when I spent weekends coding instead of doing literally anything else.

She didn't just tolerate it. She was part of it.

And I think that's something a lot of builders struggle with silently. The loneliness. The feeling that nobody around you really gets what you're doing or why you keep going.

Some of you have a partner who supports you. Some of you have a friend. Some of you have an online community that feels like home. Some of you have nobody yet and you're doing it alone.

All of that is valid.

But if there's one thing I've learned it's this:

Building alone is possible. Building with people who believe in you is a completely different game.

Not just faster. But more human. More sustainable. More real.

So today whether you're with someone or not I just want to say this:

The people who stick with you through the ugly early days deserve to be there when the good days come. Don't forget that.

And if you're looking for more builders to connect with, people who actually get this journey, I host a casual weekly session called FounderMode | Coffee & Build. No pitches. No selling. Just founders sharing what they're working on and having honest conversations.

Three builders are sharing their projects this session:

* John Martin building DialectForge in network security
* Ricky Miskin building IdeaVerify for startup validation
* Francesco Di Donato building Velocaption for video creators

Just good people building real things.

If that sounds like your kind of vibe you're welcome to join: [https://luma.com/zqrxuft4](https://luma.com/zqrxuft4)

Happy Valentine's Day to all the builders and the people who believe in them.

So, what’s the difference between weakening of the arm and just exercising it again and it will stop once the muscle gets better and all those disorders like als Parkinsons etc?

1r4oc7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1r4oc7u/i_am_genuinely_worried_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I am genuinely worried and I don’t know what to do.,"Okay VERY LONG!!! TD;LR: erratic new coworker is being increasingly aggressive and making us all uncomfortable in our therapy center full of women and young autistic kids. Our company isn’t doing anything about it and I don’t know if I should express our discomfort to HR or leave it alone. 

Ok so I am an RBT in an ABA clinic. For those of you that might not be familiar, I am a therapist for high support need toddlers and preschool aged children who are on the autism spectrum. Our clinic focuses on applied behavioral analysis which is a type of therapy. Think head start before preschool. All of our kiddos are very behavioral and non verbal. We have a small center but we are jam packed with kids and staff. 

Our company sucks. Our team is great. We have an incredibly high turnover rate with new hires and our company supposedly makes our manager basically hire a new person every week it seems. And as I’m training them or others who are in a lead position are training them, 75% of them quit after like 3 days to a month because the behaviors are very intense and I don’t think that they’re really given the DL before they get in there.

One of these new hires, our most recent one, is a late 30s guy we will call Bob. 

Bob at first seemed normal. Maybe a little over-helpful and polite but who isn’t that way when they first start a job, is maybe nervous, and wants to make a good impression.

After 2 weeks of shadowing Bob finally began being in direct with a child. Just pairing—pairing is essentially just spending 2 weeks to a month getting a kid to like you. It’s harder with autistic kids because a lot of them generally do not want to interrupt with you if they don’t know you like that. No eye contact, not acknowledging you, nonverbal, etc. It’s harder. The caveat with pairing in ABA is that you place ***zero demands***. That means you literally don’t tell them to do ***anything***. No “hey buddy give me a high five!” Or “let’s go potty” or even handing them something and saying “hey check this out pal”, nothing. You just parallel play. It’s a hard concept for people who have no ABA background which 100% understandable.

So he seemed to get frustrated when trying to pair with one of our kids. Mind you, this guy got hired and told everyone he was already working in-home cases with another ABA company. While autism is a spectrum and everyone is different, generally the vibe im describing will be experienced at some point if you are already working with this age range, which he said he was. 

So when he started complaining to our BCBA that the child wouldn’t even look at him or say anything to him, she was like “Well yeah, he’s autistic…?” He continued to try and make the child make eye contact with him and get in his face to the point he started getting upset. So he stopped interacting with him completely.

That’s when the bathroom and car thing started. 

Bob started going to the bathroom for long periods of time very often. Like once every 30 minutes. Then it escalated to him saying he was going to go grab something in another room and be right back, leaving his kid with someone, and then going out to his car like 6 times within a 2 hour session. A BCBA went to go “get something from her car” when it was noticed that this was happening a lot, and she came back in and was like “it looks like he’s having a nervous breakdown—he’s saying something and hitting his steering wheel and rocking back and fort.” 

After he came back in he was on his phone for 20 minutes and when his child eloped from the room, he didn’t notice. So the BCBA said “hey Bob, your kid just ran away and you had no idea, he could’ve ran out of the building or locked himself in a room. Please get off your phone”. Apparently he started talking back to her saying “I’m not doing this right now. I’m not getting into this with you right now now”. And then  went into the break room, put his phone in his locker and started slamming things. It made everyone uncomfortable. When my manager called him into the office after that, he apparently said “I need a break” in the middle of being told ‘you can’t slam things around like that in the work place’ and was crying. He went back into session but was pacing around and cursing and muttering. He the left and got in his car.

We were all trying to make light of the situation but everyone was lowkey very uncomfortable. When he got in his car facing the giant window of the playroom where we were all standing, he looked furious. I actually said “he’s going to drive his car into the building or something” as he whipped out of his parking spot. Everyone was like “no don’t say that” but I was actually kind of serious—something was not right. We all went into the snack room and my boss was standing in the back office on the phone with HR. After the phone call he said (without hearing what I said) “I’m staying all the way back here. That guys gonna drive his car into the building or something.”

He comes back in and finishes the rest of the shift but leaves early without telling anyone.

So the next week I’m out of work so idk what happens first hand but I heard it was a week of more of the same thing with the car and the bathroom and going from being nice to starting to be snippy and then being nice again. He starts interjecting himself into conversations where people had to stop their own conversation and go “Bob, what are you saying? I’m sorry I was just in the middle of talking”. From what I heard just odd behavior.

My one work friend and I (call her Mary) discover via Facebook that he and his girlfriend are friends with people we know that are unscrupulous, to say the least.

Full disclosure, Mary and I both used to have drug problems. The people he is friends with are people I used to smoke crack with. He also appears to have lived in a halfway house that my friend is familiar with (apparently pretty recently). When Mary messaged one of the people we both know from our past asking if she knew Bob, the girl said “oh yeah. Why did he get arrested? He’s probably using again”.

I would NEVR judge someone for being in recovery. Ever. Why would I? I’d be a hypocrite to the max, and so would Mary. We know how it is. But objectively, that’s not a great sign. Being in recovery is one thing. Obviously that’s just a speculation, I’m not going to assume he’s using just because of that statement. But that statement + the odd behavior, tbh, makes me think he *is* either using or actively going through withdrawal.

He is out all week the following week saying he is injured. We figure he’s not coming back. The following week he does 2 no call no shows. Then he shows up. So this past week.

He’s still going out to his car, he’s still going to the bathroom. Like it’s a crazy amount of times he’s doing these things. Every 30-mins to an hour he’s out in his car. He comes back 10 minutes late from break every day. My boss tells him he’s gonna need to start clocking out and clocking in every time he goes out there.

Then yesterday he was told “you need to stop going out to your car. You need to stop leaving early with telling anyone, and your need to come in when your break is done.” And he’s apparently very angry with Bob as he’s doing this. Bob comes out of the office and is visibly frustrated in the same way he has been, and goes out to his car. 

When he comes back in he’s still pacing around, making these frustrated gestures and muttering. Or he’ll stand in the corner by the bathroom in the dark and just stand there. Like fists clenched, jaw clenched angry.

Apparently my boss is “going through all of the steps” to get him terminated—I’ve been told it’s hard to get terminated here because there are so many steps you have to take. So he’s documenting everything, constantly calling HR, etc.

Everyone is increasingly uneasy. And we’re again, all trying to mar light of it bc we are uncomfortable, but the general vibe is “when Bob shoots the place up you’re gonna be first”. “I’m not coming to work tomorrow he next day if he gets fired”. “If something happens, grab the kids and reconvene at Target” kind of talk. 

Like we shouldn’t be saying that in any capacity. We are a center full of women and children. I have a serious problem with the fact that I am even feeling compelled to type this right now. The first day he started going out to his car over and over again, he should’ve been told point blank “stop going out to your car”. And then the next time he did it he should’ve have been fired. Like at ANY job, if I did something like that I would expect to be let go. So wtf? Like I am so perplexed by this. I’m also so confused as to why he hasn’t quit if he obviously doesn’t want to be there. This is a very VERY intense job. I do not blame the people who quit one bit—I remember how stressed out I was at the beginning. I actually wanted to find another job 6 months in; and back then it was nowhere near as stressful and crowded as it is right now. Honestly if I got hired with how overstimulating the environment is I wouldn’t last a week.

That being said, I wouldn’t be doing all this. This bear is weird and concerning. I actually feel inclined to email HR and say something along the lines of “I don’t think this is right that a lot of us feel uncomfortable, and nothing is being done about it.” Because apparently it’s not my boss, it’s the people above him. How true that is, I don’t know, but I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if it was (I suspect it is). 

We have also expressed concern to each other how frustrated he gets with the children. A few BCBAs have mentioned they are worried he will become frustrated enough to get aggressive and we have this adopted a center-wide policy that no doors are to be shut at any time when a staff and a kid are in a room unless there is a BCBA in there with them. At no time in our years of being open have we had to do this and all of the sudden? I suspect it has something o do with Bob.

What do I do? Do I do anything? More than half of use are genuinely uneasy going into work and being around him now. I’m not trying to be dramatic but I really feel like this is literally the type of shit you read about on the news when a disgruntled coworker gets fired and then shoots up the place or comes in with a knife or something. Like even so, there’s a school shooting practically every month—in this type of political climate why would my company even risk something like that? 

Also he purposefully drank my coffee in its entirety when he knew that it was mine. I was gonna let it go but my husband who is much more level headed and reasonable than I am said “that’s not passive aggressive—that’s aggressive. That’s something someone who is psychotic would do. Stay away from him”. If he’s saying that when he never reacts to anything that’s concerning to me. I know it sounds silly but it’s just one more thing.

What do I do? Do I wait until the company handles it? Are we overreacting? Do I email someone? I don’t know. ",2,1771085072.0,WorkAdvice,1,1.0,False
1r4obzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r4obzm/true_story_the_man_under_the_porch/,True story: The man under the porch.,"This is a true story, not the kind of horror that you find in movies or fictional books, simply a chilling experience from my youth. 

Back when I lived with my parents we had this porch, most porch’s go about half a food off the ground, this one had about 4 feet of open space, two opening on either side in case maintenance was needed. 

My family left me alone one night, I walked into the living room to just watch some stuff on the tv, out curtains were already closed, then I heard my cat deeply hissing and growling at something outside the window. Now of course I assumed it was just another cat, they were territorial and this behavior wouldn’t be out of the question. 

I walked over to see what was going on after a moment or two, when I got there and opened the curtains just enough to peak out, I didn’t see anything, not the usual fluffy cat that used our deck as a hang out, not the neighbors cat, nothing. Then suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw something move right next to the opening of our deck, something bigger than a cat. A bear maybe? Could it be some kind of wild animal?

My eyes focused to see a man with a scraggly beard, long hair that didn’t look brushed, bundled out in clothing, I could see his eyes ever so slightly they were darting back and forth, before he began hobbling way to the side of the road to walk down it.

I was completely still as this was all happening, holding my cat close to me waiting for him to leave, as soon as he did I double checked every door, I locked and closed every curtain.

This explained so much, I often felt as if I was being watched, not the normal “hm… I feel uncomfy” moment but a lingering sense of another human, even when alone, I’d heard breathing from outside my window before, staggered breathing, I’d heard foot steps around our yard before.

Before you think, “then why not say anything?” I have the tendency of hallucinating, in dead silence I hear things that aren’t there, people talking when there’s nothing, I don’t often see things though. 

When my parents arrived home the next morning they found me in the kitchen looking as if I hadn’t slept, 3 empty coffee pots next to the coffee maker, and me just staring at a window.

After telling them, they looked nervous asking if I’d just imagined this, or maybe mistook an animal for a man, I shook my head, my father that day looked under our porch, there was a clear indent of where a human had been laying, empty food containers, but nothing else. 

We called the police but I had no idea what the man’s face was like, I didn’t know his hight it all happened so quickly all I saw was the whites of his eyes and his messy hair. 

About a week later a man was found dead in the river, had been on… some illegal drugs let’s say, the kinds where if you stop taking them you’ll simply die. He had the same messy hair, and the same layered clothing.  

To this day I double check every time I think I hear something, nothings happened since, I still randomly hear things that aren’t there, but nothing has actually happened since. ",1,1771085057.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1r4oblp,https://i.redd.it/h3go2c6afhjg1,It's Valentine's Day and I'm thinking about the people who made my builder journey possible,"Quick thought for today.

I see a lot of founders saying they're taking the day off because it's Valentine's Day. And honestly that's great. You should.

But it made me think about something I don't see discussed enough in this community.

The people behind the builders.

I've been building projects for years now. Failed more times than I can count. Had moments where I wanted to quit everything. And the thing that kept me going wasn't a productivity system or a motivational video.

It was my wife Bruna.

She was there when I launched things nobody used. She was there when I cried about a project that didn't work out. She was there when I spent weekends coding instead of doing literally anything else.

She didn't just tolerate it. She was part of it.

And I think that's something a lot of builders struggle with silently. The loneliness. The feeling that nobody around you really gets what you're doing or why you keep going.

Some of you have a partner who supports you. Some of you have a friend. Some of you have an online community that feels like home. Some of you have nobody yet and you're doing it alone.

All of that is valid.

But if there's one thing I've learned it's this:

Building alone is possible. Building with people who believe in you is a completely different game.

Not just faster. But more human. More sustainable. More real.

So today whether you're with someone or not I just want to say this:

The people who stick with you through the ugly early days deserve to be there when the good days come. Don't forget that.

And if you're looking for more builders to connect with, people who actually get this journey, I host a casual weekly session called FounderMode | Coffee & Build. No pitches. No selling. Just founders sharing what they're working on and having honest conversations.

Three builders are sharing their projects this session:

* John Martin building DialectForge in network security
* Ricky Miskin building IdeaVerify for startup validation
* Francesco Di Donato building Velocaption for video creators

Just good people building real things.

If that sounds like your kind of vibe you're welcome to join: [https://luma.com/zqrxuft4](https://luma.com/zqrxuft4)

Happy Valentine's Day to all the builders and the people who believe in them.

Now go hug someone. Then get back to building.",1,1771085031.0,NoCodeSaaS,0,1.0,False

Diego was waiting there. ""Good morning everyone, this reunion is for me, to delegate each and single one of you a job. But first, I need to know what everyone can do.""



Diego pulled a list. ""Joaquin, tell me what your skills are. Also raise your hand.""



""I am Joaquin. I'm an engineer at the CTIO observatory. I can do math... uh... "" Diego was looking at him ""I can move boxes very fast"".



Diego wrote on his notes ""Then you are management and observant duty. Managing Co2, Fuel levels, Oxygen, and such.""



""Next. Natalia.""



""Here, I am Natalia, I'm a journalist""



""Probably copilot spot, your job is hearing, and observing instabilities on ice.""



""Next. Pascal""



""I am Pascal. I have a PhD on trauma surgery and experience with military teams""



""You are one of the backbones of the operation, you gonna talk to our medical team, to learn about frostbite, amputations, and cabin fever.""



""Next. Xi"" 



""Sergeant Xi, specialist on extreme environments, decorated Red Beret""



""Mister Xi, Refueling and logistical movement between tractors.""



""Next. Hudson""



""I'm a scientist at NASA.""



""Food and supply managing, you work under a clock""



""Fang.""



""I am Fang. I'm astrophysics scientist at CNSA""



""Food and supply management""



""Sergei""



""Sergeant Sergei. Arctic survival team specialist, undercover operations, Red Beret""



""Your job is refueling and logistics between tractors""



""Cristian and Edson, you are the drivers.""



Diego stood up his seat. ""Now the operation details are the next, we are currently waiting a second tractor to arrive this base""



Hudson raised his hand ""Can we get a full explanation of the operation, how we are supposed to arrive the south pole?""



""Excellent question"" Diego stood up and turned on a projector. He showed a 'PistenBully 600 Polar'. ""We are using two of this bad boys for the operation. Modified versions of it"" The machine was the same as the one that was inside the plane. A Giant square cabin, the deference was, the machine inside the plane had no side windows, and had extra compartments.  



""HOWEVER. Currently we only have 1 tractor here, we are currently waiting for the second delivery, if the weather allows it, we should have the other one next week""



Hudson raised his hand again ""What if the second machine fails to get here?""



""We just keep waiting and training. Praying the aliens are still there."".



Joaquin raised his hand ""How are we supposed to live in those?""



""Let me explain, no. Instead, follow me"" Diego walked out of the room.



The hangar, a room that was composed of six containers on top of each other. 



The group entered the hangar, there was loud noise outside, it was the wind, scratching the roof. The temperature of the room plummeted. 



Diego pointed to the machine that was parked on the center. It was the tractor. ""First rule of the Antarctic. Never touch metal with your bare hands, you will lose a chunk of skin or your whole finger.""



""Come inside"" Everyone gathered at the door of the tractor.



""As you can see, we have a thermal exchanger camera. Think like, this is going to space."" Everyone noticed, it was a tiny chamber, no more than two meters long. The ceiling was also very low; Xi was bending his neck and Serge was completely bent over. Diego opened the interior door.



""Inside here we have two bunk beds, a sofa with removable cushion"" He moved the sofa. ""Here we put emergency kits and rations"" He moved the sofa back. ""The front has two seats, the operator, and navigation""



Diego pointed a foldable bunk-bed ""These are the beds"" He unfolded the beds ""This beds can hold a maximum of two people at once, each. Sergei and Xi. It can only hold you.""



They walked out of the machine ""This machine is weighs approximately 12 tons""



Joaquin asked ""Why doesn't the ice break""



""We have established paths we have used during summer. We make sure to only drive over rock or permafrost, preferably permafrost and hard ice in our case. I don't want you getting stranded on ice""



""Now, lets go back inside"" He walked back to the conference room.



""Now, I know this is contradictory. Xi, and Sergei, refrain from heavy excessive on base and remain physically sedentary once the operation starts. Why? Simply Co2 and moisture in the air are our biggest enemies. Doing exercise in an enclosed box like the tractor outside, will ice-weld the doors shut""



Diego checked his phone ""Now currently outside is -30 Celsius, with some wind, so its feels like approximately -45 Celsius. So."" Diego stood up and grabbed a box from the floor, he put the box on top of the table and started pulling clothing from inside the box. He extended all the clothing on the table.



""As you can see, we have 4 different sets of clothing, dermal, internal, middle and external. Also here"" He pointed at some boots ""We have some called Bunny boots. These boots are designed to prevent frostbite on the foot by using layering of wool and plastic"" 



Diego walked to the door ""Now, everyone, go to your room, and grab the box on the floor labeled with your name, suit up completely, every sock, every glove, every shirt. And come back here""



Some minutes passed, they went back to the room, Diego was dressed with the same clothing ""Now follow me"" 



Diego walked to the main door of the base. They could feel the cold by just looking at the door. ""Now, we are going to stay outside for five minutes. If any of you, feel like, your clothing is loose, or doesn't protect you enough, step inside""



Diego opened the door, the wind was strong. Breathing was hard. Everyone was outside. They could see each other breath. Xi was shivering, Fang stepped inside. Those five minutes felt like an hour.



Diego stepped back inside, everyone followed. 



""This is an example of what working outside with bad weather looks like""



Diego walked towards Fang ""What is wrong?""



""My fingers hurts; my whole hands hurt a lot"" Fang was shivering.



""First remove your gloves"" 



She removed her gloves, her hands were purple. 



""I want you to massage your hands yourself, use the strength between your legs, once you recover the strength on your fingers, start using your fingers, don't stop massaging your hands"" Diego explained to Fang. She started massaging slowly.



Fang started sweating. ""My hands hurt a lot now"" 



""It's normal; don't stop the massage"" Diego was looking at Fang closely.



""wouldn't it be better go to the medic?"" Xi asked Diego. 



""Maybe there wont be a medic the next time Mister Xi"" Diego responded without looking at Xi.



Diego walked to Xi ""Xi, you are shivering, the others are not, explain"" 



""Maybe my gear is malfunctioning"" Xi looked Diego in the eyes.



""Then you should have walked inside, you could have died.""



Xi maintained silence. ""Xi, grab Fang and go to our technical room, you need to get your clothing fitted and being taught how to dress properly. Go now. And Fang"" Diego looked at Fang ""Don't stop the massage""



""The rest follow me"" They were in the hangar again, they couldn't feel the cold inside this time. ""I'm gonna teach you all how to refuel the tractor""



Hudson waved his hand ""Isn't that the job of Sergei and Xi""



""You are correct Mister Hudson, regardless, redundancy is the most important thing here. If Sergei gets incapacitated, any one of you will need to be able to refuel the machine""



""Let me get you first instructions on how to refuel this machine."" Diego walked towards the machine. 



""First before even thinking about refueling the machine, you need to attach this copper wire on the tractor, attach it. Observe the teeth of the clamp"" The clamp was really sharp. ""This teeth are made to scrape the paint out of the machine, so it can be touching metal"" 



""Now you grab the second cable, and put inside the fuel chamber. And then seal the chamber""



""Now, before any of you ask me why, this is a safe measure against static. One little spark here, can detonate the whole machine, and burn and freeze everyone inside alive. Also will probably grab the other machine and destroy it too. I need you all to memorize this step.""



""Mister Sergei I need your help. Let me teach you how to refuel. First, get the fuel out of the drum.""



Sergei stood and got fuel out of the drum, he was holding a military grade Jerry can. It was 25 Liters. 



""Mister Sergei, your posture is good, firm, but, in the future, you also need to see the direction of the wind. So you always put yourself upwind of the fuel source, so, if some fuel jumps into your clothing, you don't get frostbite""



""Now mister Sergei follow me to the tractor. The tractor is currently empty and unpowered. We don't have danger of fire. But, we have another problem, snow can get inside the machine in the middle of the refueling process. If the snow gets inside the machine, eventually will crystallize, clog the machine, and stall it""



""Now before refueling, Mister Sergei, please stand in front of the refueling port"" Sergei stood there. Diego pulled a plastic shroud and draped it over Sergei. ""Mister Sergei, refuel the machine now"" Sergei refueled the machine.



""As everyone can see I covered Mister Sergei with plastic shroud, this little protection helps against the incidental snow that can get inside the machine""



Sergei stops refueling and Diego removed the plastic shroud. ""Everyone, this is an easy refueling exercise. You must likely will find this problems, the jerrycan hose it's going to be completely frozen, inflexible, you won't be able to tell if the jerrycan is full, you are going to be unable to see the refueling spot.""



""Now this is the end of the demonstration, tomorrow everyone here is going to go outside, refuel the jerrycan, and move it to another drum. Now, tomorrow you aren't going to move fuel, it's going to be Oil, fuel is too expensive these days."" 



Diego was lying, making them move oil was a test. Its high viscosity would make the exercise harder. Sergei knew, but didn't say anything. 



""Now onto the command room, we have some replicas on the Co2 monitor and other sensors""



They walked to the command room Xi and Fang were there. ""Excellent, now let me show you the sensors.""



Diego grabbed a Co2 monitor, it was just a flat circle with a digital display on the middle ""We have two of this inside the tractor, and two replacements inside. This sensors will break if go outside""



He grabbed another similar machine. ""Oxygen sensor, we also must be sure about the oxygen of the cabin, if the Co2 monitor fails, you are sure that this will tell you the info. Same redundancy two on tractor and two replacements.""



""Here we have a barometer. Be sure to observe this one, a change of pressure on the Antarctic will let you deaf""



""The anemometer, this bad boy will tell you, WHEN, you can step outside, it can measure wind speeds. We assume winds speeds are about 250 and 300km/h, step outside only when the wind is at 60km/h or less""



""Here is a copy of a thermal array, this indicates internal status of the machine, if something is frozen, you will know."" He showed a black screen, detached. Similar to the one inside the tractor. 



""Regarding to other information. Never look the wind directly, your googles would be sandblasted""



""The path you will follow is called the McMurdo-South Pole Highway, usually in summer is not that difficult, but this is winter""



Diego stood up ""Now, once you people get close to the south pole, breath slowly, there is oxygen tanks for emergency, but the oxygen will get thinner, and you will be moving via constellation calculus. The GPS simply wont work.""



""This is all. Any questions?""



Everyone was cold, scared, the weight of the situation settled in. It was a trip equivalent to going to space.



""No questions then. Follow me to the infirmary"" Diego walked with the group; everyone was having internal doubts. 



A doctor was there waiting a lady, they couldn't see her face. ""Welcome my name is Margarita. I'm gonna prepare you to any problem you could had in this operation""



""The first problem. Cold. If your fingers are freezing, don't panic. Go inside the tractor, massage your own hands, put your hands between your legs, and use the vapor from your mouth. Your hands will hurt, but that means it is good.""



""Some of you will start hallucinating mid mission, hypoxia can attack any of you. If you see your friend with blue fingers, stop talking mid conversations, check his vitals""



""Never wet your body, if you feel moisture on your hands, dry them immediately""



""Inside the tractor, there is Vitamin D pills and UV light for Vitamin D deficiency""



""You will probably start zoning out, its normal; its really dark outside, try to look at your friend, do small talk, play cards, do anything to keep yourself active"" she paused ""If you can't talk to anyone, sing yourself a song""



""That's all. Now, someone called Pascal, I need you to stay here, let me teach about commonest medical problems here.""



Pascal walked toward the doctor.



Diego appeared from behind. ""Okay, lunch time, we have a long day ahead of us""



Everyone was seated at the same table row. Looking at each other, Xi and Sergei were the only ones unbothered. 



Hudson broke the silence ""How do they expect us to remember all that?!""



Joaquin spoke to Hudson ""Don't worry about it. We have a week to learn all that""



Joaquin noticed Natalia writing in her handbook ""What is that?""



""Oh. this? My handbook, I write everything here"" Natalia smiled.



""Why don't you use your phone for that?""



""Well, phones will not work when we are deep on at pole, and, I like my little handbook, I have most of the trip write here""



Sergei spoke to Natalia ""If you get published, send me a copy! I would love to read that.""



""Sure Sergei, I'm gonna be sure to mention your big butt"" She smiled.



Xi broke into an internal laugh. Fang hit Xi on the arm. 



It was late, everyone went to bed, tired, and some others. Scared. The cold started setting in. In the heart of the operation. 



\*\*\*



There was still some days before the second tractor arrived into the base, so the operation can start. Diego was worried about them, they were sluggish and underperforming.



Diego made all of them completely suit up. ""Everyone, we gonna do a walking test. You are gonna made to walk from the door of the base, to another door to the other side of the base. The point of this test is don't let the rope go, never let the rope go. We gonna be observing everyone via thermal cameras""



Everyone got ready. Hudson was trembling. They looked trough the windows. Outside was completely white. The wind was hitting the wall like punches onto the wall.



""Now, everyone listen to me. Outside we have a storm, a Whiteout, you have five minutes to cross the site. If you don't, you will start freezing to death""



They stepped in front of the door. The door behinds them locked. They were ready, once the door opened the wind gushed inside, like an entity making space for itself. The temperature plummeted. The engineer at the door screamed ""GO, GO, GO""



Xi was the first to step out, he grabbed the rope, it was frozen, it was more of a rock than a rope at that moment.



One by one they stepped outside. Hudson was reluctant; he stepped out, last. 



Outside the temperature was -53 Celsius. They could only see 10 cm in front of them. The rope was invisible. The wind was a punch on the senses. There was no clear horizon. Effectively, everyone was walking blind into a white paint. 



Sergei lost his balance, a gush of wind attacked his stomach, in the floor, he never let the rope go, he stood up, but accidentally looked directly at the wind. His goggles were sandblasted in seconds. His instinct was his demise. He tried to clean his goggles, he let the rope go.



He realized his mistake, tried to grab the rope again, it was no longer there. He panicked and tried to grab onto anything, he no longer knew where is north or south.



By coincidence or instinct, a hand appeared from behind Sergei, it grabbed him and pulled him. It was Hudson. He was shivering. Sergei didn't know who it was. But he managed to feel the rope again. Sergei to manage his brain, he closed his eyes and walked along the rope.



Everyone got inside. Exhausted, everyone was out of breath, once Hudson entered the room, two engineers waiting pushed with all their might to close the door. They were safe, inside the base once again. 



The engineer directed everyone resting ""Please, check your fingers, walk inside, do not approach the engine room, lets your body slowly recover its temperature.""



Sergei sat on the floor. He looked at Hudson, he didn't notice. ""I knew you had my back"" He smiled to Hudson. He was to exhausted to react at that moment. 



Diego approached Sergei and knelt ""What happened outside Sergei?""



""A gush of wind knocked me over. I lost my direction"" Sergei spoke ashamed.



""You let the rope go. You will be dead if isn't because your partner. Never let the rope go.""



Diego stood, he sighed ""It's a fair mistake, we need to fight against our instincts here. Also. I'm aware of you being taller being a disadvantage here. Next time, bend walk.""



Diego walked a bit ""Everyone, go get coffee to the cafeteria. Get warmed up, read your documents and guides again.""



Diego walked to the command control ""Mister Zhao, are you getting comfortable with this tech?""



""Yes, is a bit different from what I'm used to, but math is math"" Zhao looked at Diego. 



""Good. We are working against time. I have been notified, in two days the tractor arrives.""



Diego collapsed onto a seat. He was exhausted ""Tough lesson?"" Zhao asked. 



""Yes."" Diego rested a bit. ""I need a beer""



""Maybe once the operation is over we can have a drink. I have some alcohol you might have not tried. On land"" Zhao told to Diego.



""I appreciate mister Zhao. I'm gonna close my eyes a bit.""



Zhao continued doing notes, writing, observing the machines in silence.



A day passed. Outside there was no wind. They were training passing oil from drum to drum. 



Zhao observed Fang working very hard, the run they had to do. He observed Xi. His graceful movements and his speed. That didn't matter for Zhao. His eyes were tired. He stood in silence looking, thinking.



Diego appeared from behind. He gave a hot cup of coffee to Zhao. He spoke ""They are doing good today.""



Zhao spoke to Diego ""Can we cancel the operation?""



Diego drank a big sip from his cup ""I wish it was that easy.""



Zhao spoke again ""Why this happened on my lifetime""



Diego scratched his own back. He remained silent.



Zhao walked and looked at Diego ""Forget I said anything""



They day was here. The plane arrived. Unloaded. The tractor was inside the hangar. Diego was talking to everyone there ""As you can see, we using a 20 meters tether. The tractor always need to be at least 5 meters from each other. Now, everyone, follow me into the reunions room""



Everyone was seated inside ""Okay, I'm gonna announce the teams compositions.""



Diego cleared his throat ""First team Cristian, Sergei, Hudson, Joaquin and Pascal. The second Team, Edson, Fang, Xi, Natalia and Pascal""



Fang raised her hand ""Why pascal is in both teams?""



""Miss Fang, Pascal is a wildcard, he will be rotating between tractors, if someone gets sick, Pascal will treat them.""



""Another detail, the tractor from behind will have more drag than the front, since its carrying fuel drums""



Diego sat. A strange silence overcame the room. Diego scratched his eye. ""You people did good. Remember the training. Keep yourself alive. Tomorrow, in early morning, everyone departs""

There was nothing sexual or romantic (I've seen them interact and at this point I've read all of their texts/emails) but he was deceptive around his communication with her some of which was late at night about platonic subjects like movies and such but still. Even though I tried to get to know her (we had her over for dinner, I gave her my phone number and invited her to a get together we were having, etc), she never put in any effort and would continue to text him and invite him to things without me. I was pregnant when they were becoming friends and she texted him fully knowing I was in labor at the hospital that she was high on drugs, which I feel is just idiotic and disrespectful.

He told her last month that he can't continue their ""friendship"" because it's been inconsiderate of me, which was largely his fault, but he also told her things she could have done better. For her part, she seems emotionally immature, said that she was intimidated by me and doesn't have many married friends so she didn't know the etiquette. He told her not to contact her anymore and that he will be cordial and civil at work. Now she wants to get coffee with me to apologize and I don't really have any interest.

I'm single, have no children or fur-babies, and still live with my parents (extremely common here!).

# Section One: Assets and Debt 

**Retirement Balance:** $243k. I contribute 20% of each paycheck, with an employer match. Approximately half of this can be utilised to buy a property when I reach the minimum age.

**Investments:** $245k. This is a global index fund which I buy on a monthly basis. I started this since I got my first job, but only really 'locked in' a couple of years after that.

**House Equity:** None. I'm looking to buy a house in about 5 years time, so will be separately saving up for that. I'm expecting prices to be \~$600k-$700k for a 650 sq ft apartment, and am slightly stressed on how to afford that on just one income.

**Savings account**: $20k for an emergency fund.

**Checking account:** $2.5k

**Housing Fund:** $36k. I am contributing $500 each month.

**Other Sinking Funds:** $16k. Majority is my travel fund for the year.

**Credit card debt:** $0. I utilise a credit card for almost everything (currently playing the miles game), and pay off the balance each month.

**Student loan debt:** $0. My accountancy degree cost \~$25k, and I am extremely thankful to my parents for helping me to pay it off.

# Section Two: Income

**Income Progression:** I've been working for 8.5 years now (time flies!), and my starting salary was $2.9k a month. My current salary is $7k a month (excl employer match).

**Take-Home**: \~$5.6k. I contribute 20% to retirement ($1.4k), employer matches $1.2k. 

**Any Other Monthly Income:** No other income sources except from my job, and the occasional dividend of a couple of hundred dollars a few months each year.

# Section Three: Expenses

**Parents Allowance:** $1.3k/month. I take this as my contribution to the household since I'm staying with them.

**Taxes**: $240 a month, but will likely increase to \~$290 from April onwards.

**Insurance:** $200/month.

**Phone Bill:** $10/month. I'm on a sim-only plan which works well for me.

**Housing Fund Savings**: $500. I'm still not quite sure this is enough to get me there in 5 years, am considering increasing the amount/investing the balance since interest rates are only \~1.5% now, even in HYSAs.

**Holiday Fund Savings:** $833/month. I am aware it's a huge chunk, but I love travelling and I cut down on other areas instead, to afford this.

**Brokerage:** \~$3k each month. A portion of this is from my company's ESPP plan, which returns to me every half year. This excludes the 20% pre-deductions and employer match to my retirement accounts.

# Money Diary

**Sunday**

**10am:** I wake up without an alarm and am extremely glad I still have a day of the weekend left. Shuffle out of bed, do my morning ablations, brew a cup of coffee, and nurse it while staring into space and zoning out.

**12pm:** My parents come back from their weekly pilates class and tsk at me because I'm still sitting there in my pajamas. They order me to get ready to head out for lunch because they don't feel like cooking. We walk \~15min to an eatery near our house, chatting all the way.

**12.30pm:** Lunch! I'm starving. I order a noodle dish ($4), and they order the exact thing they get every time we go. We contemplate dessert after, but I decide against it.

**2pm:** Home! Contemplate another cup of coffee, but I decide on a tea instead, despite the hot weather. I throw on Grey's Anatomy and continue binge watching. It's a peaceful day, but I try not to feel the Sunday Scaries creeping in about work the next day.

**4pm:** I drag myself To the gym. It's supposed to be a legs workout day, but I wasn’t in the mood To do much. Did a couple of sets of squats and RDLs, and finished up with a 30-min incline walk rather than forcing myself through the rest of it. I remind myself done is better than perfect.

**6pm:** Dinner - my dad cooked us pasta with chicken tonight. Once again, he asks if we can taste something 'special' he did to his usual dish, and I say yes, but that I don't know what it is. We chat more over dinner, and I wash up after.

**7.30pm:** I pack my bag for work tomorrow, and make a face as I check my email, hoping nothing requiring my attention has been sent to me over the weekend. My inbox was empty - all is good!

**8pm:** I continue watching Grey's Anatomy till late before I finally drift off to sleep.

**Total: $4**

**-------**

**Monday**

**8am:** I drag myself out of bed. How is it already Monday? I do my usual morning banter with my dad begging him to brew me a cup of coffee, he jokes that he retired last year only to become a full-time barista in this family. I make my own coffee but let him steam the milk and try some latte art.

**8.30am:** I suddenly realise I missed my doctor's appointment on Saturday to get a vaccination. I call up the clinic and schedule the appointment to tomorrow instead.

**9.30am:** Arrived to work, and realised I'm the earliest in my team to reach. I have a meeting with my boss, and spend the next half an hour fretfully Not Thinking about it.

**10.30am:** I got a promotion!!! I've been fighting for it for the past year, but towards the end of last year, started thinking that no way it'd happen, and got really burned out at work. I'm flabbergasted. It's a 20% increment, which would push my base salary (excluding bonus) above $100k for the first time in my life. I exit the meeting still floating and break the good news to my parents and a couple of close friends.

**1130am:** Lunch with a few of my colleagues. One of them treated us to lunch, which I was exceedingly grateful for. Had a nice hour just sitting at the restaurant and talking about work and holiday plans. We check the time - it's still early. We head to get a matcha ($7.20), which I was willing to splurge on as my colleague had covered lunch and as a tiny celebration to the happy news I had received.

**6pm:** I'm done with work and leave with a cheery goodbye. I take the metro home, and the total public transport fare to and fro for today was $2.98.

**6.30pm:** I eat a banana and drink a glass of water before heading to the gym. I'm still floating.

**8pm:** I have dinner with my family, and tell them I want to treat everyone to a nice meal to celebrate. It's a buffet I found, which would cost me \~$500 for 6 pax. It's a huge splurge and I never spend this kind of money on myself, usually, but I wanted to do something nice to thank my parents for the support. We agree to dinner on 1 Mar, and I mentally note to budget for this from my paycheck.

**Total: $10.18**

**-------**

**Tuesday**

**8am:** Beg my Dad for a cup of coffee, and we go through the whole song and dance once more. My parents congratulate me again on the good news, and I tell them to look forward to the buffet.

**8.30am:** Head to the doctor to get my vaccination. I hate needles. The cashier informs me that the government subsidies this vaccination, so I only need to pay $19 out of the $50 it cost. I claim this amount from my company insurance.

**9.30am:** I reach office and immerse myself in work. We have a meeting today, and it's usually quite combative. Non-stop meetings, discussions and calls.

**1pm:** The call went... not great, but it's over. My team goes for lunch together, and my boss picks an expensive place that's out of my usual lunch budget. I sigh and accept my fate. The total bill was \~$30.

**7pm:** I head home via the metro, listening to a concert playlist of my favourite artist. Again, the metro to-and-fro cost me $2.98. I reach home and head to the gym, before having a quick dinner and an early night.

**Total: $51.98** ($19 will be reimbursed)

**-------**

**Wednesday**

**8.30am:** It's my work from home day! I make a cup of coffee and sit in the living room chatting with my parents till the workday starts. Breakfast is a piece of orange cake my mum's friend gifted her. Once again, I contemplate taking up baking.

**1pm:** Lunch is simple - a couple of half-boiled eggs, bread and some tomatoes. I finish it up and head back to work.

**3pm:** My mouth is itchy, so I head to the kitchen to grab a snack and a mandarin orange. Chinese New Year is coming, so my house is stocked with a couple of cartons of oranges. 

**6pm:** I log off from work and have dinner with my family. It's rice and soup today, and my mum's friend has also gifted us a bottle of home-made thai chilli. We try it and fall in love. My mum insists we need to ration it and eat it sparingly to make it last.

**7pm:** I head to the gym to do a half an hour incline walk on the treadmill.

**8pm:** I put on Grey's Anatomy in the background, and sit down to rework my personal budget for the year. The increment I will be getting has given me a lot more leeway, and I am grateful. I decide to finish pre-funding my travel fund with my bonus this year (total fund goal of $15k for 2026), and continue contributing $833 a month, to fund my 2027 travels. It's doubling my 'travel expenses' this year, but it's been something I've been wanting to do but been unwilling to cut down my investments for it.

**Total: $0**

**-------**

**Thursday**

**8am:** Coffee and breakfast, before heading off to work. It's one more day in office till the long weekend, and I am excited.

**1130am:** Lunch! I sneak off for lunch by myself before my team mates can ask me out, trying to average down the expensive lunch I had on Tuesday. I head to a food centre and order rice and a couple of dishes for $5.50. It's crowded and still early when I was done, so I decided to walk around the area, weaving in and out of buildings until it's time to head back to work.

**4pm:** My phone vibrates. I check it. My pay and bonus is in! I do a mental happy dance, before sending a quick note to my colleague who asked to be alerted as well.

**6pm:** I head home, again paying $2.98 for the metro. My friend is stressing about a job interview she has tomorrow, and we try to calm her down and throw out potential questions and answers. She asks again if I think the pay she is asking for is too high, and I tell her to just shoot her shot.

**7pm:** A quick dinner, and then I start to do a couple of money transfers and allocate my pay check. I again question putting my entire bonus (\~1.3 months of salary, after the 20% retirement contribution) into my travel fund instead of investing it. I (again) conclude that it's the same thing - whether I pre-fund it by using this amount which enables me to do regular monthly investments, or invest this amount and scramble to scrape together the money each month whenever I want to book something. The result will be the same either way - I will be spending the same amount of money, and one method will lead to less stress for me.

**9pm:** I'm chatting with my friends about nonsensical things and scrolling social media. One more day to the weekend, I'm excited.

**Total: $8.48**

**-------**

**Friday**

**8.30am:** It's a WFH day for me, and the last day before an extremely long weekend. My office is closed until next Thursday. I make coffee and eat the last of the orange cake.

**1pm:** Lunch is soup and rice. My sister is also working at home today, so that was nice.

**2pm:** My friend texts me asking for excel help. I do my best, but tell her that I cannot envision what she wants and to please show me the excel. She gives up and says that this will be Monday's problem. I agree.

**4.30pm:** A teams message comes through. Someone was asking in my team's group chat about a deliverable that I had a part in, but had handed over. I look at the clock and pray no one asks me to follow up on it right now. I'm counting down to the end of work.

**6pm:** Work is over! I try doing a last refresh of a file I wanted to run overnight - my computer hangs on me for 15 min and makes me force-close to file. I give up and decide to run it on Monday instead.

**6.30pm:** I start watching a Netflix documentary about Lucy Letby. I am interrupted by diher, which is pasta and grilled chicken, yum! I discuss my plans for the weekend with my family, then wash up the dishes. I go back to watching the documentary

**9pm:** I head down to the gym for a quick work out. I am admittedly not as focused as I should be. My friend told me some exciting news, and I was texting her half the time!

**Total: $0**

**-------**

**Saturday**

**10am:** I wake up and make myself a cup of coffee. My parents are still around having breakfast - I was surprised, thinking they'd already left for their exercise class.

**11am:** I head to the gym. I'm going out later in the day, so I need to leave enough time to wash and dry my hair before that.

**12pm:** Lunch. Eggs and avocado toast. I tell my parents that this is very Gen Z of them. I text my friend asking if she has woken up yet, because we were supposed to meet at 3.

**2pm:** My friend responds, and we agree to push back the time. I continue enjoying my Saturday and watching my shows.

**430pm:** I leave the house - I'm taking the metro to meet my friend in town. They're hosting an exhibition for Monet's paintings, and I paid $13 for a ticket.

**7pm:** We head out to the mall nearby for dinner. It’s raining, and we decided on ramen, which cost me $16. The broth was amazing and I was happy with the choice. We went to dessert afterwards, which cost $4 for my share, a double-boiled matcha milk pudding which was AMAZING.

**10pm:** We walk towards the metro to head home. I remind my friend that we need to withdraw money for the upcoming Chinese New Year holidays, and end up drawing $260 for monetary gifts to my parents from a nearby ATM. The metro ride both ways cost me $3.18.

**Total: $296.18**

**-------**

**Total Spending: $370.82**

Gifts: $260

Food: $66.7

Transport: $12.12

Activities: $13

Health: $19



# Reflections

This was pretty much an average week with respect to expenses, apart from the money I withdrew for the upcoming celebrations. My weekdays are pretty free since I don't particularly enjoy going out if there's work the next day. My plans are usually crammed into Fri-Sun, which would be the bulk of my spending, usually. I'm expecting expenses to go up, as I have full weekend plans for the rest of the month.

Finances wise - I feel okay. I have an okay savings rate - and while it would be much higher if I were to cut down travel, I don't want to sacrifice that aspect of my life. I'm relatively frugal in other areas.

One stressor for me right now is saving up to buy a house. Prices are astronomical for a single here - most people who buy houses over here are couples. Right now, the house I'm planning for (worst case scenario) is $700k and I gave myself a renovation budget of $70k.

Wow, this was a little more chatty than I expected! I feel like my life is usually routine/boring like this, which is a blessing in itself too. Hope you enjoyed reading this little sneak peak into my life over here!",6,1771084821.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,1.0,False

Love is not always the color red.

It’s in green

in mountains that remind you to breathe

It’s in blue

in vast oceans that hold your quiet thoughts

It’s in pink

in soft flowers blooming gently

It’s in yellow

in sunlight spilling through the branches of trees

It’s in orange

in sunsets that end the day softly

It’s in purple

in quiet evenings and creative dreams

It’s in white

in clouds in the sky, in stillness and pure intention

It’s in brown

in cozy homes, warm coffee, and well-loved books

It’s in gray

rainy afternoons that aren’t perfect but still meaningful

Love is not always loud. Sometimes, it’s soft. Sometimes, it’s quiet. Sometimes, it’s simply there... in every color of your life.

1r4o7i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1r4o7i3/my_brain_was_hijacking_my_productivity_until_i/,"My brain was hijacking my productivity until I discovered the ""Zombie Task"" phenomenon","""So you're telling me you've been working all day, but haven't actually done anything?"" my friend asked, stirring his coffee.

I nodded, feeling that familiar mix of shame and frustration. Despite sitting at my desk for nine hours, all my important work remained untouched.

""Let me guess,"" he continued. ""You spent the day answering emails, attending meetings, organizing files, checking notifications, and doing busy work that feels productive but doesn't move anything meaningful forward.""

It was like he had installed surveillance cameras in my office. ""How did you know?""

""Because you're stuck in zombie tasks,"" he said matter-of-factly. ""Tasks that keep your brain busy enough to feel productive but aren't challenging enough to require real focus. Your brain is basically sleepwalking.""

He explained that he'd learned about this from his cognitive behavioral therapist. Apparently, when we're facing challenging work that causes even mild anxiety, our brains instinctively divert us to these ""zombie tasks"" - work that feels safe, provides small hits of accomplishment, but ultimately avoids the discomfort of deep work.

""The problem,"" he continued, ""is that zombie tasks provide just enough dopamine to keep you satisfied while simultaneously draining your day of any time for meaningful progress.""

I thought about my typical day: the constant email checking, the endless Slack conversations, the reorganizing of my to-do list, the tidying of my desk - all while my actual priorities remained untouched.

""So how do you break out of it?"" I asked.

""First, you have to identify your zombie tasks. They're the things you do automatically when you're procrastinating. For me, it's checking analytics and reorganizing my task manager.""

He then shared his simple but effective method. Every morning, he writes down his three most important tasks for the day. Before opening his laptop, he sets a timer for 30 minutes and works exclusively on the first important task. No email, no messages, no preparation - just immediate engagement with the challenging work.

""The key is to engage with meaningful work before your brain has a chance to suggest alternatives. Once you've started, it's much easier to continue.""

Skeptical but desperate, I tried his approach the next day. The first 10 minutes were physically uncomfortable - I could feel my brain screaming for the familiar comfort of checking email or organizing my desktop. But I pushed through.

By minute 15, something shifted. I entered a flow state and worked for nearly two hours straight on a project I'd been avoiding for weeks. By lunchtime, I'd made more progress than in the previous three days combined.

Over the next few weeks, I refined the approach. I identified my personal zombie tasks (checking email, reading industry news, organizing files) and became more aware when I drifted toward them. I started each day with a 30-minute focused session on my most important work, before allowing myself to check messages or attend to smaller tasks.

The results were remarkable. Projects that had stalled for months suddenly moved forward. My stress levels decreased as I stopped carrying the mental weight of uncompleted important work. And perhaps most surprisingly, I found myself finishing work days with energy remaining rather than feeling depleted.

The zombie tasks still call to me daily - they always will. But now I recognize them for what they are: my brain's attempt to avoid the discomfort of meaningful work. And knowing that has made all the difference.

Has anyone else recognized these ""zombie tasks"" in their own work life? What strategies have you used to overcome them?",1,1771084771.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

1r4o4o7,https://i.redd.it/h3go2c6afhjg1,It's Valentine's Day and I'm thinking about the people who made my builder journey possible,"Quick thought for today.

I see a lot of founders saying they're taking the day off because it's Valentine's Day. And honestly that's great. You should.

But it made me think about something I don't see discussed enough in this community.

The people behind the builders.

I've been building projects for years now. Failed more times than I can count. Had moments where I wanted to quit everything. And the thing that kept me going wasn't a productivity system or a motivational video.

It was my wife Bruna.

She was there when I launched things nobody used. She was there when I cried about a project that didn't work out. She was there when I spent weekends coding instead of doing literally anything else.

She didn't just tolerate it. She was part of it.

And I think that's something a lot of builders struggle with silently. The loneliness. The feeling that nobody around you really gets what you're doing or why you keep going.

Some of you have a partner who supports you. Some of you have a friend. Some of you have an online community that feels like home. Some of you have nobody yet and you're doing it alone.

All of that is valid.

But if there's one thing I've learned it's this:

Building alone is possible. Building with people who believe in you is a completely different game.

Not just faster. But more human. More sustainable. More real.

So today whether you're with someone or not I just want to say this:

The people who stick with you through the ugly early days deserve to be there when the good days come. Don't forget that.

And if you're looking for more builders to connect with, people who actually get this journey, I host a casual weekly session called FounderMode | Coffee & Build. No pitches. No selling. Just founders sharing what they're working on and having honest conversations.

Three builders are sharing their projects this session:

* John Martin building DialectForge in network security
* Ricky Miskin building IdeaVerify for startup validation
* Francesco Di Donato building Velocaption for video creators

Just good people building real things.

If that sounds like your kind of vibe you're welcome to join: [https://luma.com/zqrxuft4](https://luma.com/zqrxuft4)

Happy Valentine's Day to all the builders and the people who believe in them.

It's not real. I created it to show you what ghost jobs typically look like so you know what to watch out for. 

**EXAMPLE OF A FAKE GHOST JOB:**

**Marketing Coordinator** FAKE Tech Solutions | Remote | Posted 127 days ago

**To Apply:** Send resume to [jobs@faketechsolutions.com](mailto:jobs@abctechsolutions.com)



**Okay, now let me explain why this screams ""ghost job"":**

**🚩 The posting has been up for 127 days**

This is huge. Most real jobs get filled within a month, maybe two at most. When you see something that's been posted for 90+ days, ask yourself: why?

If a company genuinely needs someone, they'd fill the position. They're motivated to get someone in there doing the work. But 4 months later and it's still open? Either:

* Nobody wants the job (which tells you something about the company or the pay)
* They're not actually looking at applications
* The job was never real to begin with

Think about it - if your company desperately needed a Marketing Coordinator, would you really let that position sit empty for over 4 months? Probably not.

**🚩 The company description is meaningless**

""Dynamic, fast-growing company revolutionizing the industry""

Okay but what do you actually DO? Do you make software? Sell products? Provide services? What industry are you even in?

Real companies say specific things like ""We build project management software for construction companies"" or ""We're a chain of urgent care clinics in the midwest.""

When a company won't tell you what they actually do, it's usually because:

* They copy-pasted a generic template
* There is no real company culture or mission to describe
* It's a fake posting and they didn't bother making it believable

**🚩 It's full of meaningless buzzwords**

""Rockstar,"" ""self-starters,"" ""innovative culture,"" ""passionate,"" ""dynamic""

These words sound nice but they don't tell you anything real. What does ""rockstar"" even mean in this context? What makes the culture ""innovative""?

Real job postings talk about actual work: ""You'll create content for our Instagram account which has 50k followers"" or ""You'll plan and execute our quarterly product launches.""

When a posting is all buzzwords and no substance, it's because there's no actual work to describe. They're filling space with corporate jargon because there's nothing real underneath.

**🚩 The responsibilities tell you nothing**

Let's look at these again:

* ""Support marketing initiatives"" - What initiatives? Email campaigns? Social media? Events? Be specific.
* ""Coordinate with team members"" - To do what exactly?
* ""Manage various projects"" - Which projects? What kind?
* ""Other duties as assigned"" - This is just lazy

Here's the thing: if a company actually needs to hire someone, they know WHY they need that person. They have specific work that needs to get done.

A real posting might say: ""Write and send our weekly email newsletter to 10,000 subscribers"" or ""Manage our LinkedIn company page and create 3 posts per week"" or ""Coordinate our attendance at 6 industry conferences per year.""

See the difference? Those are REAL tasks that a REAL person would do.

When responsibilities are super vague, it's usually because nobody actually sat down and thought ""what will this person do all day?"" Because there is no actual person they're planning to hire.

**🚩 The requirements are absolutely ridiculous**

They want you to be an expert in Adobe Creative Suite, Google Analytics, Salesforce, HubSpot, SQL, HTML/CSS, SEO/SEM, Mailchimp, AND Hootsuite.

Let me be real with you: that's insane. Those are completely different skill sets.

SQL is database querying. HTML/CSS is web development. Adobe Creative Suite is graphic design. These aren't things one person typically masters all of. You'd need like three different people with different specializations.

Why would a ghost job do this? A few reasons:

**Reason 1:** They copy-pasted requirements from multiple different job descriptions without thinking about it. They grabbed some stuff from a ""Marketing Manager"" posting, some from a ""Graphic Designer"" posting, some from a ""Data Analyst"" posting, and mashed it all together. Because they're not actually hiring, they didn't bother to make it make sense.

**Reason 2:** They're creating an impossible standard so they can later say ""we couldn't find anyone qualified."" This lets them justify never filling the position, or it gives them an excuse to lowball whoever they do eventually hire with ""well you don't have ALL the skills we asked for.""

**Reason 3:** They want to collect resumes from people with all different skill sets so they have a database for future use. Cast a super wide net, see what you catch.

**🚩 They want 5-7 years of experience for a ""Coordinator"" role**

Coordinator is typically an entry to mid-level position. You might need 1-3 years of experience, not 5-7.

Someone with 5-7 years of experience should be looking at Manager or Senior positions, not Coordinator roles.

This mismatch tells you either:

* They want someone with senior-level experience but only want to pay coordinator-level salary (major red flag about the company)
* They don't understand their own job levels and organizational structure (disorganized company or fake job)
* They're trying to seem more prestigious than they are (fake job padding)

**🚩 ""Competitive"" salary**

This means absolutely nothing. Competitive with what? Competitive compared to who?

Is it $40k? $60k? $90k? You have no idea.

Now, to be fair, lots of real companies also don't list salaries. It's frustrating but common. However, when you combine it with all these OTHER red flags, it adds to the pile of ""this seems fake.""

Here's why it's extra suspicious for ghost jobs: If you're not actually hiring anyone, you don't have an approved budget. You haven't gone through the process of getting sign-off to spend X amount of money on a new employee. So what would you even put as the salary? There isn't one.

**🚩 They want you to email your resume to a generic address**

[jobs@companyname.com](mailto:jobs@companyname.com)

Most real companies nowadays use applicant tracking systems (ATS). You apply through their website, or through LinkedIn, or through Indeed's application system. There's a structured process.

When it's just ""email us,"" your resume is going into some inbox that might not even be monitored. There's no tracking, no system, no process.

Who's reviewing these emails? How are they organizing them? Are they even looking at them?

A generic email address is easy to set up and makes it easy to collect a bunch of resumes without having any real process for what happens next. Because nothing happens next. It's a ghost job.



**Here's the big picture:**

Look at this posting as a whole. What do you actually KNOW after reading it?

You don't know:

* What the company does
* What you'd do every day
* What success looks like
* What the team is like
* Who you'd work with
* What you'd actually get paid
* Why they need this role
* What problems you'd be solving

You know NOTHING real.

And that's the biggest sign of all. Real jobs are specific because real companies have real needs and real work that needs to get done.

Ghost jobs are vague because there's nothing real to describe. It's just corporate word soup thrown together to look like a job posting.



**What real jobs look like instead:**

Good postings are specific. They might say things like:

""We're a B2B SaaS company with 50 employees. Our Marketing Coordinator will manage our email marketing program (we send 2 newsletters per week to 15,000 subscribers), coordinate our quarterly webinar series, and maintain our company blog. You'll work directly with our Marketing Manager and collaborate with our 3-person content team.

See how different that is? You know exactly what you'd be doing, who you'd work with, what they're looking for, and what it pays.



**So how do you protect yourself?**

When you're looking at a job posting, ask yourself:

* Can I picture what I'd actually be doing every day?
* Do the requirements make sense together?
* Does the experience level match the job title?
* Has this been posted for a really long time?
* Is anything specific, or is it all vague buzzwords?

If you can't get clear answers, that's a red flag. And if there are multiple red flags like in my example above, seriously consider skipping it.

Your time is valuable. Don't waste it on jobs that were never real to begin with.



**Have you seen postings like this?**

Drop examples in the comments (just remove the company name). Let's help each other learn to spot these before we waste hours tailoring applications.

The way they hummed and rattled like a lullaby,  
the overstuffed seats that swallowed you whole,  
soft as memory,  
even if your back paid for it later.

You’ll miss the grand, dramatic recline  
that bold surrender into someone else’s kneecaps.  
You’ll miss the unspoken elbow negotiations,  
the absence of armrests  
that turned strangers into reluctant dance partners.

There was charm in it.  
In the dated carpet,  
in the way the furniture felt like  
a waiting room from 1993  
that somehow kept rolling.  
It was familiar.  
And familiar is a kind of love.

But love, real love  
isn’t staying the same forever.

The new Airo and Venture sets  
aren’t here to erase what was.  
They’re here because we asked  
for better.

Seats that support instead of smother.  
Recline that respects the person behind you.  
Actual armrests, clear borders,  
peace treaties in molded form.

ADA access not as an afterthought,  
but as a promise.  
Automatic doors that open without struggle.  
Ramps that say, simply,  
you belong here.

Windows wide enough to make the journey  
part of the destination  
big, bright frames for rivers and cities,  
sunset turning steel to gold.

Tray tables that hold more than  
just a cup of coffee  
they hold laptops, letters,  
shared snacks across bay seating  
where strangers become companions.

A café car with a mini bar  
because travel should feel  
a little celebratory.  
Refreshed lavs.  
Bottle filling stations.  
Details that say someone thought this through.

Yes, it feels more European  
sleeker, intentional, composed.  
Less nostalgia, more future.

But isn’t that the most romantic thing?

The old coaches carried us for decades.  
They did their part.  
They bore the miles,  
the snowstorms,  
the quiet midnights between cities.

This Valentine’s Day,  
let’s thank them  
and let them rest.

Because upgrading isn’t betrayal.  
It’s devotion to the journey.

And the rails are still the same rails.  
The rhythm is still that gentle sway.  
The whistle still calls into the dusk.

Only now,  
the future answers back  
brighter, kinder,  
and built for all of us.",1,1771084501.0,Amtrak,1,1.0,False

I see a lot of founders saying they're taking the day off because it's Valentine's Day. And honestly that's great. You should.

But it made me think about something I don't see discussed enough in this community.

The people behind the builders.

I've been building projects for years now. Failed more times than I can count. Had moments where I wanted to quit everything. And the thing that kept me going wasn't a productivity system or a motivational video.

It was my wife Bruna.

She was there when I launched things nobody used. She was there when I cried about a project that didn't work out. She was there when I spent weekends coding instead of doing literally anything else.

She didn't just tolerate it. She was part of it.

And I think that's something a lot of builders struggle with silently. The loneliness. The feeling that nobody around you really gets what you're doing or why you keep going.

Some of you have a partner who supports you. Some of you have a friend. Some of you have an online community that feels like home. Some of you have nobody yet and you're doing it alone.

All of that is valid.

But if there's one thing I've learned it's this:

Building alone is possible. Building with people who believe in you is a completely different game.

Not just faster. But more human. More sustainable. More real.

So today whether you're with someone or not I just want to say this:

The people who stick with you through the ugly early days deserve to be there when the good days come. Don't forget that.

And if you're looking for more builders to connect with, people who actually get this journey, I host a casual weekly session called FounderMode | Coffee & Build. No pitches. No selling. Just founders sharing what they're working on and having honest conversations.

Three builders are sharing their projects this session:

* John Martin building DialectForge in network security
* Ricky Miskin building IdeaVerify for startup validation
* Francesco Di Donato building Velocaption for video creators

Just good people building real things.

* People who crash every afternoon and don't know why
* Anyone who drinks coffee ""too late"" but isn't sure what ""too late"" means for THEM

I think of all the good memories we had. I watched eternal sunshine of a spotless mind again a couple days ago. I thought of what I would do if it was real. The way you treated me was the best anyone ever had and I’m glad you were able to give that to me even if it ended. I just wish I could’ve woken up with you to go get coffee and sit on the beach and watch one piece afterwards. A normal day but it would be special because it was spent with you. I wonder what you are doing today and what you are thinking about. I don’t know why my mind goes to the worse things possible you could be doing and thoughts of you never thinking of me ever again flood my mind. Maybe it’s true or maybe I just think that because I couldn’t imagine ever leaving the person I loved so much. I don’t know why you did what you did and I don’t think you do either.

1r4nyui,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r4nyui/how_to_flirt_without_being_creepy/,How to Flirt Without Being Creepy: Psychology-Backed Tactics That Actually Work,"Spent way too much time figuring this out, so here's the playbook. Not theory from some dating coach's course, actual insights pieced together from psychology research, convos with female friends, a few painful failures, and content from people like Dr. Andrew Huberman and Mark Manson who actually break down human behavior without the BS.



The main issue isn't that guys are inherently creepy. Most aren't. The problem is that nobody teaches this stuff properly, and we end up learning from terrible sources like pickup artist forums or rom coms where stalking somehow equals romance. Society gives mixed signals about masculinity and approach dynamics, plus our biology screams ""reproduce"" while our prefrontal cortex tries to maintain social calibration. It's a mess. But here's what actually helps.



\*\*Respect her autonomy first, everything else second.\*\* This sounds obvious but gets ignored constantly. Creepiness isn't about what you say, it's about ignoring signals that she's uncomfortable. The research is clear on this. Women perceive creepiness when guys don't respond to rejection cues or create situations where they feel trapped. So flirting successfully means paying attention to her responses and adjusting accordingly. If she's giving one word answers, facing away from you, or checking her phone constantly, that's your sign to gracefully exit. Not double down.



\*\*Make your interest clear but keep it light.\*\* Ambiguity creates weirdness. If you're attracted to someone, own it, but frame it as ""I think you're interesting and I'd like to get to know you"" not ""I've been watching you for three weeks and memorized your coffee order."" The[ book](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) Models by Mark Manson breaks this down perfectly. Manson spent years researching attraction dynamics and his core argument is that polarization beats neutrality. When you're clear about interest without being intense about outcome, you filter for mutual attraction naturally. This book will make you question everything you think you know about dating advice. Best relationship psychology book I've read, hands down.



\*\*Use humor but not at her expense.\*\* Self deprecating humor works infinitely better than negging or jokes that put her on the spot. Neuroscience shows that laughter releases oxytocin and dopamine, which builds connection. But forced humor or jokes that feel like tests create anxiety instead. Reference something in your shared environment, make an absurd observation, tell a ridiculous story about yourself. Keep the ratio like 70% playful conversation, 30% genuine interest in what she's saying.



\*\*Body language matters more than your words.\*\*[ Dr. Vanessa Van Edwards ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)researches nonverbal communication and her findings show that charisma is like 60% body language. Keep an open stance, don't lean in too close initially, mirror her energy level without being robotic about it. If she's relaxed and laughing, you can be more animated. If she seems reserved, match that. 



For those wanting to go deeper on social dynamics without spending hours reading through dense psychology books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's a personalized audio learning app built by AI experts from Google that pulls from top dating psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom podcasts just for you.



You can type in something specific like ""become more confident in dating as an introvert"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan tailored to your exact situation. The app connects insights from resources like Models, The Like Switch, and actual behavioral research into bite-sized episodes. You control the depth too, from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and context. Plus the voice options are ridiculously good, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes commute listening way less boring. Worth checking out if you want actionable strategies without the typical self-help fluff.



\*\*Ask open ended questions and actually listen.\*\* Sounds basic but most people suck at this. Instead of interview mode questions, try ""what's your take on this?"" or ""how'd you get into that?"" Then genuinely engage with her answer. Follow up on details she mentions. Women can instantly tell when you're just waiting for your turn to talk versus actually caring about their perspective. Active listening builds attraction because it's rare.



\*\*Escalate slowly and watch for green lights.\*\* Physical escalation shouldn't jump from handshake to arm around shoulder. It's gradual. Light touch on the arm during conversation. See if she touches you back or leans in. If yes, continue. If she creates distance, back off immediately. The book The Like Switch by Jack Schafer covers this in detail. Schafer was an FBI behavioral analyst who studied how to build rapport quickly, and his framework for reading comfort levels is brilliant. Not creepy FBI tactics, just solid behavioral science applied to social situations. Made me rethink how I approach all interactions honestly.



\*\*Know when to exit gracefully.\*\* This is the difference between memorable and uncomfortable. If the conversation isn't flowing or she's clearly not interested, smile and say something like ""nice chatting with you, enjoy your day."" Then leave. Don't linger hoping she'll change her mind. Don't ask for explanations. Just move on. That confidence and respect for her decision is infinitely more attractive than persistence. Plus you maintain your dignity.



\*\*Work on yourself outside these interactions.\*\* Real confidence comes from having a life you're genuinely excited about. Hobbies, friendships, goals that matter to you. When you're outcome dependent on any single interaction, that desperation seeps through. But when you're flirting from a place of abundance, where rejection doesn't threaten your self worth, everything becomes easier and more natural.



\*\*Practice calibration constantly.\*\* You won't nail this immediately. You'll probably misread signals sometimes or say something that lands weird. That's fine. The goal is getting better at reading rooms and adjusting in real time. Every interaction teaches you something about social dynamics if you pay attention.



Look, flirting is just communication with romantic intent. It doesn't need to be this high stakes performance. Most women appreciate genuine interest expressed respectfully way more than some rehearsed routine. Lead with curiosity about her as a person, respect her boundaries, and don't take rejection personally. That's like 90% of not being creepy right there.",4,1771084170.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs).

If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

Edit: I wrote this last night.

I (f 20’s) met a guy (30’s) whilst thrifting, I’ll refer to him as Gerard for the sake of privacy.

It was like 5pm and I’d just gotten off work, every month or so we have a really long training as a team in a large damp makeshift conference room and I honestly looked like shit, mascara was smudged around my eyes and my outfit was egregious as those training days we all dress intentionally bummy to suit the uncomfortable environment. He dropped a hanger in the check out line and I picked it up and we had one of those semi awkward meet cute moments that don’t really happen in real life, typically only seen in films that make you roll your eyes, regardless of my judgement of those movies, that is something I’ve always wanted to experience. Anyway I walked out of the store a minute after Gerard and I guess he could see me from his car in the parking lot and asked if I had dice in my car, I didn’t. We had this lil convo and hit it off and he followed me on Instagram, found out we had similar interests whatever.

Fast forward a week and I didn’t even follow Gerard back I just enjoyed the moment we had. I honestly wasn’t thinking about talking to men or interacting with them at that point, I had just gotten (5 months) out of a long but very childish relationship and I was/am thriving since, so it barely crossed my mind that he was possibly flirting with me.

Anyway one day like approximately a week after we met he PM’d me on Instagram and asked if he was too old for me, I said I didn’t care because my dimwitted mind didn’t realize he was flirting with me, so I was thinking no he’s not too old to have a conversation with me you know?? I don’t care about that, it’s not the point of the story. There was banter, it was good, eventually he asks for my number and texts me throughout the day not in a crazy way but in a light conversational way. I have a job where there is periodic down time between meetings so it was honestly nice to have something to do besides introspect during the downtime. Later that night he asked me out to dinner, I said no I don’t meet men at night for the first date. We decided upon seeing a movie together in a week or two I can’t remember how many weeks sorry, but cool, I love movies. We actually end up seeing each other before then (intentionally) at the same store in which we frequent. And we talked after in my brand new car by the way, and it was one of the most enjoyable conversations I’ve ever had with a man, typically they are weird to me and there’s a lot of silence or they make me uncomfortable by staring at me in a slightly predatory way but he actually had interesting things to say about the music we both like and other life stuff and it was just so easy.

After that he asked permission to kiss me, actually he sort of asked me to kiss him if I wanted to. It sounds kind of weird but I am legitimately traumatized from a prior experience in my youth with a dude forcing me into something so this was actually refreshing and it was that yummy kinda consent.

It was the best kiss I’ve ever kussed. Then we talked a bit more and he kissed me again before he left and it felt like I was ascending into astral territory and bathed in the light of god, then slowly placed back down on the earth with the finesse one would use to handle a precious item.

later in the week I texted him “I can’t wait to know more about you” or something to that affect. He said “I’m an open book ask me anything” so I asked him all the normal cute questions like what’s your favorite color and what do you think happens when you die or whatever and we had some great discourse as per usual with this guy.

Then I had a weird feeling \*omg what if he’s married\* because someone I had a short situationship awhile ago turned out to be married with kids and I had NO idea. So I had to ask, in a playful and joking way after complimenting him somehow, “oh I bet you’re married” he seemed alarmed when he said “NO??!!!!!!” And I said “you seem too good to be true you must have some fatal flaw” and he said “I’m complicated” I asked what that entailed and he said he is in a domestic relationship with someone but they don’t do couples yoga and are relatively aromantic. I’m not looking for anything serious or anything at all at that moment so I was like “oh interesting” and we chatted about it, me being genuinely interested in how that all worked out, he said that his partner asked him to see other people to fill the role of couples yoga partner that she doesn’t want, idk if I can say that word on here. And honestly I was ok with that because I’m hypereggsual and just needed a cork to cap my wine bottle.

Anyway we hang out a few more times before the movie we planned to see together, real short and sweet, nothing smutty just vibes and conversation and a few smooches (my god 😻). And when we see the movie together it turned out to be a 4 hour long movie and it was in one of those theatres where the seats aren’t separate and he held me close, it felt so nice. It was a movie we’d both seen thousands of times before so it didn’t take much focus and I could barely keep my eyes off this man. I typically end up hating the man after the first few times I see them, getting really grossed out because they turn out to be a stupid and mediocre human being, but not this man, he actually interested me which was so weird and crazy.

Anyway after the movie he walked me to my car kissed me and then left in a hurry, it was really cold though so I understood. He didn’t talk to me much that night, understandable like he probably had his fill.  Anyway it snowed like 10 inches the next day and everyone in our town was snowed in and it was Sunday, but he didn’t text me at all that day, I thought I was the one who grossed HIM out.

That night I got curious about the man I was seeing and looked up “Gerard Way Thetownwelivein” and “Gerard Way NYC” because he mentioned living there before living in our current town and not much popped up besides other people with his name because it’s quite common but there was one or two curious things one was a wedding gift registries and it said “Gerard Way and Hayley Williams wedding registry” and that gave me a feeling that I needed to do some digging.

I went on Facebook, I don’t know why I didn’t do this sooner, on his FB, there was a picture of him with a girl sitting on his lap, the picture was from 2022 but I was so sure that was his domestic partner that he’d referenced before. I soon found she didn’t have any online presence besides Tik Tok which I dug endlessly to find. Low and behold, it was Hayley Williams. He was engaged, I haven’t brought this up to him that I know that he is specifically engaged.

Bit of time goes by and I’m house sitting for my dad while he’s on a psychedelic retreat and he doesn’t care who I fuck so I invited Gerard over one of the nights I was there.  He comes over and brings a bottle of wine, we both have like half a glass, and we’re happily yapping for a long time. He disclosed to me that his girlfriend financially abuses him, she makes over twice as much money as him and makes him pay for everything, obviously I have no receipts or proof this is all word of mouth. But he also said that she thinks he’s gross and that the only thing she loves is money. I listen to people for a living so I’m just sitting there actively listening to the most insane tea I’ve ever heard about his relationship. I am biased slightly at this point because I am starting to genuinely enjoy his personality but I kept comments to a minimum and during that convo tried to act like he was my client and only saying “I can understand why that would make you feel sad about your relationship” “that must be really hard, have you tried communicating your feelings”. But eventually that topic of conversation ended and he told me he was grateful for the time he got to spend with me. He touched my foot and it tickled and he said “damn girl what size are your feet like a size 12?” They aren’t I’m a 7.5/8 whatever. And I was like “you asshole” and tried to put him in a headlock in a playful way; I’m a lot smaller so it was futile. We ended up having couples yoga and I finished. I didn’t tell him I finished because I don’t think he deserved the ego boost but I’m on 80mg of Fluoxetine so typically I can’t reach that point no matter what techniques are used. We cuddled after and it was sweet, kind of overwhelming how sweet it was. While he was at the door about to be leaving he kept taking to me for another half hour like he didn’t want to leave, honestly melted my heart. He texted me later checking on me making sure I was feeling okay and he said goodnight too. I saw him a once or twice more after that, without any coition or acts of lust and it was lovely as ever.

I saw Gerard a day after his birthday and I gave him a note and a few Polaroids of me semi undraped which he hinted at wanting prior as well as a leather notebook. When he opened the gift, the notebook, he nearly cried, but didn’t. I thought it was kind of strange because it was a notebook but he was ecstatic to  the vintage-esque half noodles of me. He told me he didn’t get anything else for his bday. That made me sad. We also both really love old things so we went to come vintage shops and got coffee he said it was the best part of his birthday.

As someone in the care field, regardless of weather or not this is something romantic or something completely temporary or fatuous, I’m just glad I could make someone happy. That evening I realized I had real feelings for this person, like genuine care and a sort of love, not like in love or something crazy but like an amplified version of the kind of love I feel for all human beings. It was weird because typically I’m the one liking the dude a lot less than he likes me.

He told me a few days later that his girlfriend yells at him every day and they just had a really bad fight. He said she yells at him until he breaks down and is then mean about the breakdown. He said she tried to size him up during an argument and was chasing him down the hallway of their place in anger.

I told him that if he were my client I would try raise awareness about possible emotional and physical risks of the situation.

Fast forward to this past Wednesday. We made plans to go to a record store together they have an amazing collection of new and pre owned records and cds oh my god. This man’s a nerd so he’s showing me all his favorite albums and I do the same and it’s lovely, since we both live in the same town as the record shop we both know the lady that works there and another random customer  and chatted with them a little and the random customer said “my wife kicked my stuff out into the basement” Gerard said “I’d take a basement, a garage even, anything to get out of my house” and there was a beat where the random customer and the record store lady probably thought I was Gerard’s girlfriend in which he was trying to escape the house of. But that awkward beat passed. After that he asked if he could come over I agreed because although I don’t live alone my place is empty this week. So he comes over and we have a cup of tea, we don’t even go to my bedroom this is shocking we are sitting on the couch in my living room and I we talked about the places we used to live and how I have to move soon. He said “can i tell you something” I said of course and he told me that in therapy he was discussing leaving his girlfriend and he also told his therapist about me. This shocked me. He also said he can’t leave his situation because he would be destitute and have nowhere to go. Then he said that he was having relationship problems with his girlfriend years before he met me and reassured I wasn’t the reason for his problems, I honestly didn’t think I was in the first place, because he did solicit me as someone who had a fiancé but now I’m worried I actually am the one who caused a problem. He also said he had a daydream dream/crazy idea that we could run away to Seattle together I asked him how much he was joking and he said “I’d consider it”I talked about wanting to move to the other side of the country before and he had that as a common interest so it’s not something random. Obviously that’s not something that we are doing but I thought way too much about how easy it would be for me to move out of my currently inconvenient living situation and for him to move out of his possibly abusive situation if we rented a 2 bed apartment together, sure it’s unconventional but I’d rather have him as a roommate than some rando from fb marketplace.

Am I crazy??

Part of me wants to tell his lady that her man is cheating and the other part of me is completely on his side as his friend and just wants him to be safe,  and the last part of me selfishly wants him for myself.

This morning he told me asked me to dinner next week and said “we’re such a cute couple” and I said “we rly would be” and he said “oh I thought we almost are” and I said “yeah I’d like that” he said “idk I think we already are lol” I said “you’re complicated remember?” He said “can I say something?” “You’re perfect for me, you are, we go about life similarly”

Then we both went to work

Then this evening at like 9 there was an incident at my house where some unidentified person came to my house and covered the peephole and banged at the door and honked their car for hours, I was so scared I called the police… and I texted him about it, he was so there for me it was a dramatic shift from what I’ve experienced in past friendships, relationships, situationships or whatever the heck this is. He told me to basically let him know I’m alive throughout the night and called me and calmed me down from my mental breakdown I had when I thought someone was going to come in my house and kidnap me or worse.

If he is who he says he is he’s my dream man, if he’s not then that’s tough luck I guess. I just realized this  is a lot to think about and I stayed up way past my bedtime thinking about a man which is crazy for me to fathom. Criticism is very welcome, please tell me your perspective.

1r4nw8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1r4nw8i/role_eliminated_in_reorg_given_90_days_to_find/,Role eliminated in reorg — given 90 days to find internal job but getting no support. What should I do?,"Hi all — looking for advice navigating an internal reorg.

I’m a Director-level employee at a large corporate company. I joined the company two years ago. I’m still a newbie compared to everyone on my team who has been at the company 6+ years. I was recently told my role is being eliminated and I’ve been given \~90 days to find another internal role. At the level and function, there aren't many openings and new ones don’t pop up often, so I’ve started networking internally.

What feels strange is that a more senior person on my team is getting promoted and essentially absorbing all of my responsibilities — plus additional scope — so the work is clearly still needed, just not my position at my level. I was told as we get closer to the end of these three months I am expected to fully train her and ramp her up.



This situation started after my original boss quit and my manager‘s scope increased. Because of that, he needs a more senior person under him and they don’t have the headcount for two people. My newest boss who just replaced my old boss is someone I’ve never worked with directly and doesn’t know me yet. He’s fully aware of what’s going on but he’s still feeling the team out and being very corporate/arms length.



My current direct manager, who is a very difficult personality in general, is still expecting me to perform at full capacity while also running an internal job search. He’s been snippy / unsupportive when I mention that I’ve been networking and setting up coffee chats, even though internal networking obviously takes time. He and I have butted heads in the past, not really about work but about style (he micromanages, is condescending, he blames me for things he forgets he said to do, would make me feel bad if I had a doctors appointment or had to leave at 6pm (which is a very reasonable time on my team), he changes his mind on deadlines a lot, moves goal posts, he’s generally moody and not empathetic or friendly, etc). I’ve had to tell him to cool it a few times last year, which I know he didn’t like. That being said I’ve always done my work and I was told by him and HR my role elimination is not performance related just bad luck.



HR advised me to start looking internally, perhaps at other divisions (where I don’t know anyone) and check out internal job posting site for open roles. There were only 2, I applied to both and both interviews went nowhere yet (it’s been over a week since I had them). I have a gut feeling it’s because my manager or new boss didn’t proactively vouch for me, which is something I know has to happen here because internal placement is all very political.   
HR has also implied that a new role is about to open on my team, at my level, but it will not automatically go to me, id have to interview for it against multiple other candidates. I’m concerned some funny business is going on between my manager and HR, and since I never spoke up before,  HR only has one narrative (my manager’s).



At this point, I feel like I’m being told “find a new job internally” but I’m being given zero coaching, advocacy, or help — and I’m worried I’m quietly being pushed out. Like I said, I’m 2 years at this company and don’t have many allies, most people here have been here their entire careers.

My questions:

* What’s the smartest way to approach HR in this situation without sounding paranoid or defensive or shooting myself in the foot. Should I stand behind my work but tell her I have a bad manager who isn’t helping me?
* How do I protect myself in case this turns into “we couldn’t place you” and we gave you three months to find a job but you haven’t found one so now we’re giving you a severance package and goodbye. This is a huge company and I don’t want to leave 
* I already have a lawyer on the sidelines in case this does lead to a severance package situation, but I’m trying to land another role and not get to that point

Any advice appreciated.

Just a solid connection. Someone who can match energy, send memes, maybe debate iced coffee vs matcha like it’s a personality trait. We can hype each other up, talk about life, maybe even romanticize the fact that we’re both just existing.

I (28M) work in a high-pressure sales environment. Last year, a management position opened up. It was between me and ""Adam.""

Adam was the office favorite. Charismatic, organized, and honestly, a slightly better salesman than me. My boss made it clear that Adam was the frontrunner for the role. I needed the raise (about $20k bump), and I wasn't going to let him have it.

So, I started a campaign of subtle sabotage.

It started small. I would go into the shared drive and move his client files into the ""Archive"" folder, then ask him loudly, *""Hey Adam, why did you archive the Johnson account? They're still active.""* He would look confused, apologize, and move it back. I did this once a week.

Then I escalated. I would access his unlocked calendar when he was at lunch and delete one random meeting invite. He would miss the meeting, the boss would get annoyed, and Adam would swear he never got the invite. I would chime in, *""Dude, I saw you accept it yesterday, you okay?""*

By month three, he was visibly rattling. He started taking detailed notes of everything because he thought he was losing his memory. So, I started messing with his physical desk. I’d hide his notebook in the breakroom. When he asked if anyone saw it, I’d say, *""Yeah, you left it by the coffee machine again.""*

The breaking point was a presentation for the VP. He had his slide deck ready. Ten minutes before the meeting, I went into the file and deleted three crucial slides from the middle. When he was presenting and clicked to a blank screen, he froze. He panicked. It was a disaster.

After the meeting, he had a full-blown panic attack in the breakroom. He confided in me that he thought he had early-onset dementia or a brain tumor because he ""couldn't trust his own mind anymore."" I acted concerned and told him, *""Honestly man, you have seemed really scattered lately. Maybe you should take some time off.""*

He took medical leave the next week. I stepped in as ""Interim Manager."" I crushed the role. By the time Adam was ready to come back, the position was permanently mine.

He quit shortly after. I looked him up recently; he’s working a much lower-level job at a non-profit. I effectively destroyed his career trajectory and his confidence for a title change.

She said na nagpapalambing naman daw yung aso namin, as she was patting her gently daw (like what we usually do pero hindi naman siya nangangagat not until ito nga) then bigla daw siyang kinagat at sa labi sumakto.

Hindi ko siya masamahan kasi night shift siya sa BPO and sabi naman niya, ittry niyang iconsult sa company HMO kung macocover. Hinayaan ko muna siya but I asked her to keep me updated on what will gonna happen so then I can also assist her, most esp, sa expenses.

Sobra din akong nag-alala dahil sa nakarating sa akin from mama na sinasaktan daw ng tito namin ang aso namin na yon kapag wala kami sa paligid and it hurts me so much, as it also hurts me so much na nakagat ng aso naming iyon yung kapatid ko.

Sobrang malambing yung aso naming yon kaya I don’t know what to feel rn about that.

This makes the card largely useless for 75% of my grocery spend.

In their words:

""Please note that Bilt classifies transactions based on the merchant category code, which is established by the business itself, not by Bilt. On our end, we can see that this transaction is coded as 5499 (Miscellaneous Food Stores), which falls outside the specific scope for the grocery category and the 3x bonus points!""

This is notable because 5499 tends to be the code used by smaller ethnic groceries, such as Asian markets that are not part of major chains. It is also notable because these same locations code as grocery on the Amex Gold and others, even showing up as grocery in the AwardWallet app code checker. The majority of my grocery purchases are through such small markets, since many of the products they sell are unavailable at chain groceries. They are also often the only grocery option for people in certain communities. 

Elaboration on the code for anyone interested:

SIC Code 5499 (Miscellaneous Food Stores) covers retail establishments that sell specialized, niche, or specific types of food products not typically classified under general grocery, meat, or produce markets. These stores are part of the broader ""Food Stores"" industry group and often focus on healthy, gourmet, or culturally specific food items. 

Common Types of Miscellaneous Food Stores (SIC 5499):

Health & Dietary Food Stores: Stores focusing on vitamins, supplements, and specialized diets.

Specialty Food Retailers: Coffee and tea stores, spice and herb shops.

Specialized Produce/Protein Dealers: Egg dealers, poultry dealers (including live poultry), and similar niche retailers.

Niche Markets: Gourmet shops, natural food stores, and ethnic food specialty stores. 

Other: Specialized water dealers (mineral water). 

Examples in the Field:

Keurig Green Mountain

Dean & Deluca Inc.

Super Supplements Inc.

Small Local Retailers: Examples include specialty ethnic markets, local health food shops, and specialized candy shops. 

Key Characteristics:

Industry Focus: Retail sale of specialized foods.

Non-Food Items: These stores may also sell related items like health products, vitamins, or personal care products.

Industry Size: There are over 21,000 companies classified in this industry in the USA. 

Note: In modern credit card processing, MCC 5499 is often used for these types of specialty food stores and convenience markets. ",0,1771083727.0,biltrewards,5,0.44,False

First time large-level socialization has been easy for me.  I can be myself and they still reach out, and I in kind. It’s pretty effortless and NO drama. I’m also pretty sure than more than half of them are ND, so i found my people. 

They text me to make plans, invite me to parties, include me in Secret Santa, go to wine tastings, board game night, video game nights, dive bars. Combined birthdays (three of us share the same). It’s huge! Like 20-30 people.

But my “girl friend” group has got to shit over the years… and I feel like a bad person because I haven’t figured out why they don’t include me in anything. Not even a pity invite. No bday brunches, no girl’s night out, etc. I’ve tried to plan 1:1 coffee/tea dates, but it’s always, “that sounds nice we should do that sometime.” That sometime never happens. 

Then my friend “Sarah” moved back from New York this summer after six years away. She’s splitting her time between our town and her folks. So, when she is in town we’ve had some good 1:1s. When the rest of the friend group didn’t invite me to a birthday party Sarah was also invited to, she got super mad and said she wouldn’t go without me. It was so nice having someone speak out like that. 

Then over the past 3 months, she texts less and less, invites happen less, and when I initiate she’s either not in town or “busy”. I invite her to every one of the guy events (they usually have their partners there so it’s diverse), but she’s never up to it. 

The last hit to my heart was that it was her birthday, and she ended up having a bday lunch… without me. Saw pictures of the girls bringing her flowers and everything. 

I’ve been in huge meltdown / burnout mode for the last week because of an endometriosis flare up. So I’ve been super sick and out of it. I forgot to ask if she was doing anything for her birthday.

The social anxiety nightmare started in high school when I stopped eating breakfast and lunch because I did not want people to see me eating alone, nor did I want to eat in front of a lot of people, I always felt so embarrassed for doing something so normal. So I would only eat when I got home at 2:30 PM. 

However, I started to feel sick. I developed a dry cough, and some nights, I could not sleep because of the burning in my esophagus. At times, I could not breathe properly, a problem I still face to this day. After graduating, I went to the doctor because i felt like my throat was closing every time I would eat and I knew that it was time to find help. The doctor told me that I had GERD and it could have been caused by various factors, I told her I would starve myself sometimes and I would not eat properly because of my anxiety.

Today, I need to take a pill every day just to not feel like shit everyday. I have stopped drinking coffee, soda, eating junk food because they mess up my stomach, something that didn't happen before I started high school and got GERD. I also cannot drink alcohol or smoke.

A Novel by Nathan Thorne

Summary:

Deep in the wilderness, where roads vanish and maps refuse to speak, stands Black Hollow Manor—an ancient estate with no history and too many missing persons. Every few years, a new family arrives. None leave.

The truth lies beneath the floorboards.

Within the Manor, a secret cult known as The Hollow Ones carries out an ancient ritual—sacrificing entire families to a god that sleeps in the pit beneath the house. A god that hungers. Each room is a trap. Each hallway a lie. Some victims vanish without a trace. Others are taken screaming, their fates sealed in blood and silence.

But this time, the ritual finds a flaw.

When the Whitmore family is lured to the manor under the guise of a dream home giveaway, their teenage daughter Cassie begins to see them—the dead. Not just shadows, but remnants of those consumed by the pit. And she doesn’t just see them. She commands them.

As masked cultists close in, Cassie awakens a power older than the house itself. The souls bound in agony answer her call. Walls bleed. Rooms scream. And the pit… listens.

Because Cassie is more than a witness.

And the god beneath the bones wants a queen.

 

 

 

Chapter 1: The Hollow Ones

 

The walls of Black Hollow Manor swallowed sound like a mouth sewn shut. Deep within its labyrinthine corridors, behind a bookcase that led to a hidden chamber, the ritual had already begun.

A single lantern flickered in the suffocating dark, its glow casting long, writhing shadows across the cold stone floor. The air was thick with the acrid stench of burning flesh, mingled with the sharp, metallic tang of fresh blood.

A family of four knelt in the center of the chamber, their wrists and ankles bound in sinew-thick rope that had flayed their skin raw. Behind them, the Pit yawned—no mere hole, but a blackened maw carved into the bones of the earth, its edges cracked with symbols burned on the rim, and looking as though the world itself had been torn open. From within came a low, wet breathing, as if something vast and sleeping was drawing them in one heartbeat at a time. The father, slumped forward, barely clung to consciousness—his face ashen, his forearm mangled where the Hollow Ones had begun their ritual. The mother wept in jagged whispers, her body curled protectively around the children pressed tight to her sides—two trembling shapes streaked with tears and blood, their eyes wide and fixed on the living nightmare that pulsed behind them.

Surrounding them, robed figures stood in a perfect circle. Their masks, smooth and featureless, glowed eerily in the dim light of the lantern. They did not speak. They did not move. They simply waited.

A door at the far end of the chamber groaned open. The figures turned in unison.

A man stepped forward, his robes stained deep with dried blood, his mask carved with jagged symbols that seemed to shift under the flickering light. He carried a long, curved blade, its silver edge chipped and worn from years of use. The Hollow Father. The leader of the unseen. His presence alone seemed to suffocate the room further, the air thickening, pressing down on the living like a pair of unseen hands.

The Pit opens its mouth,"" he said softly. ""And we must fill it with screams.

He knelt before the father, gripping the man’s chin with bloodied fingers and forcing his gaze upward. The father’s eyes were dull, half-lidded, drained of hope. His lips parted, as if to beg, but no words came. There was nothing left to say.

""It is an honor to be chosen,"" the Hollow Father murmured, his tone almost reverent.

Then the blade struck.

It was not clean. The dull edge tore through flesh and sinew, sending hot crimson gushing across the stone floor. The father convulsed violently, his body thrashing against his restraints as a wet, gurgling noise escaped his shredded throat.

The mother screamed.

The children began to wail, their cries sharp, piercing, cutting through the heavy stillness like knives. The mother lurched forward, but the ropes held her fast. She sobbed hysterically, trying to shield them, but there was no escaping what was coming next.

The Hollow Father dipped his fingers into the pooling blood, thick and steaming, and turned to the others. He smeared dark, wet symbols across his mask, his breathing slow, measured, savoring the moment.

""One soul for the Dark Below.""

The masked figures whispered the words in a chorus, their voices layered and distorted, an unnatural harmony that seemed to slither through the chamber’s walls. Something deeper beneath the Manor stirred, a tremor that vibrated through the stone, a low, guttural groan of anticipation.

The mother thrashed as the Hollow Father placed a cold hand against her cheek, tilting her face up toward him. There was no pity in his touch, only purpose.

""It is mercy to go first,"" he whispered, pressing the blade to her throat. She barely had time to scream before her lifeblood joined her husband’s.

The children’s sobs turned into raw, animalistic shrieks, their tiny bodies convulsing as they fought against the inevitable. The shadows in the room darkened, thick tendrils of something unnatural coiling along the walls, drawn closer by the fresh offering.

The girl went next.

The boy last.

Their bodies crumpled to the floor, lifeless dolls discarded in crimson pools.

The Pit exhaled a sound like dying breath through shattered ribs—wet, low, and hungry. The walls wept black, and veins of rot unfurled through the stone like ink spilled in water, pulsing with stolen life. The sacrifice seeped into the marrow of the earth, and the Pit—ancient, endless, obscene—shuddered in satisfaction. It had tasted agony. And it was full.

For now.

The Hollow Father wiped his blade clean on his robes and stepped back. The lantern flickered once, then burned steady.

The ritual was complete.

The bodies would be cast into the pit, swallowed by the dark that remembers nothing. By dawn, there would be no trace of them—no names, no blood, no memory. Their screams would unravel into silence, lost forever in the churning void beneath the bones

For now, the Pit would sleep.

But it would not sleep for long.

 

 

Chapter 2: The Invitation

 

The email arrived at 3:33 AM.

But something else came first.

Cassie Whitmore lay awake, her phone screen casting a pale glow against the ceiling. Sleep had abandoned her hours ago, but tonight felt different—thicker somehow, like the dark had weight. The shadows in the corners of her room didn’t just exist. They watched.

A faint creak split the silence.

She turned toward the sound—and froze.

There, at the edge of her bed, stood a boy.

No older than ten, his skin pale and waxy, like it hadn’t seen sunlight in years. His eyes were wide and black, not angry—empty. As if whatever had once lived behind them had been scooped out and thrown away. His clothes were wrong, tattered pajamas soaked at the hems, and his bare feet left no mark on the carpet.

Cassie blinked.

He was suddenly closer.

Standing beside the bed now. Leaning in. His mouth hung open like he was about to scream, but no sound came—just a thin trickle of blood from the corner of his lips, slow and deliberate, sliding down his chin like a question.

Cassie couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. Her phone slipped from her hand and hit the floor with a dull thud.

The boy tilted his head, eyes narrowing.

Then, in a twitching blur—he was inches from her face.

Cassie screamed.

The room snapped back.

The boy was gone.

She was alone again. Her breath ragged, her fingers trembling as she fumbled for the phone. The screen lit up—new notification.

3:33 AM.

Subject: Congratulations, Whitmore Family! You’ve been selected for an All-Inclusive Dream Home Vacation.

Cassie stared at it, heart pounding.

The dark didn’t feel patient anymore.

It felt hungry.

Her stomach twisted as she called out, “Dad?”

A groggy groan from the next room. Heavy footsteps. A moment later, her father’s silhouette appeared in the doorway, rubbing his eyes. “What?”

She turned the phone toward him, her hand still trembling.

Her voice cracked as she tried to sound normal—tried.

“We… we won a house.”

At first, Ethan Whitmore thought it was a joke. Another scam. Too good to be true. But something about the subject line hooked into his exhaustion, sharp and insistent:

Congratulations, Whitmore Family!

He blinked at the screen. It was too specific. The email listed their full names, their current address, even Cassie’s birthday. The offer was surreal—an all-expenses-paid stay at a luxury estate, nestled deep in the mountains, where they could experience the property before deciding to buy.

A limited-time opportunity. Exclusive.

The fine print was suspiciously thin.

Ethan should have deleted it. He should have closed the email and gone back to bed. But he was tired—more than tired. A mid-tier accountant clinging to a dissolving career, he was one more corporate layoff away from financial oblivion. Their rental was suffocating, a shoebox of unpaid bills and silent, sleepless nights. Meredith’s job at the community college barely covered their survival, and Cassie’s tuition at St. Augustine Academy bled them dry.

Maybe this was a miracle. A way out. A sign.

Cassie’s voice cut through his thoughts. “Is it real?”

His throat felt dry. “Looks like it.”

“We should go.”

Ethan hesitated. “I’ll call in the morning. Talk it over with your mom.”

Cassie said nothing, but in the dim hallway light, Ethan caught the tight set of her jaw, the way her knuckles whitened around the phone. Her eyes weren’t focused—not on him, not on the screen—just fixed on something far away. Something that wasn’t there.

He opened his mouth to ask… What did you see?

But the words stalled.

She looked pale. Rattled.

Like she’d just woken from a nightmare she couldn’t explain.

Ethan hesitated. Part of him wanted to press, to demand answers.

The other part—tired, unsure—let it go.

For now.

 

 

 

By morning, the decision was made.

Cassie padded into the kitchen, still rubbing sleep from her eyes, as her father murmured into the phone. His voice was lighter than it had been in months.

“Yes, of course. That sounds great… Yes, we’ll head up there before noon.”

He hung up, turning to his wife and daughter with something dangerously close to a smile. “Apparently, our names were entered into this contest, and we won.”

Meredith glanced at him over her coffee, skeptical. “And you believe that?”

Ethan shrugged. “They verified everything. Sent us the contract. It’s all legit.”

Cassie didn’t say a word. Her fingers traced absentminded circles on the countertop, her gaze unfocused, as if listening to something just beyond the walls.

A faint creak came from the hallway, too soft for her parents to notice—but her head tilted slightly, like a dog catching a distant sound. The shadows beneath the kitchen door seemed thicker than they had a moment ago. Denser.

Ethan chuckled nervously, pouring coffee into a chipped mug. “You good, Cass?”

She nodded once. But she didn’t stop drawing circles.

Meredith raised an eyebrow. “You sure? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Cassie blinked slowly. Her eyes flicked toward the window, toward the trees shifting in the early morning fog.

“Maybe I did,” she murmured. “Or maybe it saw me first.”

Ethan’s hand paused halfway to his mouth. He studied her for a second—really looked at her. That far-off stare. That quiet, bone-deep chill that didn’t belong to a kid.

He cleared his throat. “You know,” he said quietly, “sometimes I still think about the morning we found you… just a baby on the doorstep, not even crying. Just staring up like you were already older than we’d ever be.”

Cassie didn’t look at him.

Neither did Meredith.

They let the silence linger.

Because deep down, neither of them had ever figured out where Cassie came from.

And now… the dark she was born from had started to watch.

 

 

Chapter 3: The Road to Black Hollow

 

The drive stretched on longer than expected. The directions were vague, leading them off the main highway and onto a snaking backroad where the trees pressed in like silent watchers. Cell service flickered and died miles ago, leaving them alone with the hum of the engine and the rhythmic crunch of tires on gravel.

Cassie sat in the back seat, earbuds in, staring out the window. The further they drove, the more wrong everything felt. The trees looked gnarled and ancient, their twisted limbs reaching over the road like skeletal fingers. The air had changed, thickening, pressing against the car like an unseen force.

Then, the first one appeared.

A man stood at the tree line, his face obscured by shadow. His body was unnaturally still, his head tilted slightly as though listening. Cassie’s breath hitched. She blinked. He was gone.

A second later, another figure emerged from between the trees—an old woman, her skin slack and gray, her lips moving soundlessly. Her cloudy eyes locked onto Cassie, and a whisper brushed against her ears, though the windows were sealed tight.

Turn back.

Cassie yanked out her earbuds, her pulse hammering. She turned to her parents, but they were oblivious. Ethan gripped the wheel, his knuckles white, muttering about the GPS freezing.

Meredith scrolled through her phone, frustrated at the lack of signal.

The figures outside multiplied.

A boy missing half his face stumbled out onto the road, his one good eye weeping black ichor. He lifted his hands—bloody, shaking—before vanishing like smoke.

More came.

A woman cradling a bundle wrapped in cloth, her mouth stretched in a silent scream.

A man with his throat slit wide open, blood soaking the front of his suit.

They didn’t just stand at the roadside anymore. They were getting closer.

Cassie squeezed her eyes shut, her breath shallow.

Something cold pressed against her cheek.

She snapped her eyes open to find a ghostly child perched beside her in the backseat, her small hands smeared with something dark. Her mouth moved, forming words Cassie couldn’t hear, but her eyes—wide, unblinking—were filled with sheer terror. Cassie could feel it now, the thick weight of dread clawing at her ribs. The ghosts weren’t just lingering. They were desperate.

They were trying to warn her.

“We should’ve seen a sign by now,” Meredith murmured, glancing at the frozen GPS.

“We’re close,” Ethan said, gripping the wheel a little tighter. His voice was strained, tired.

Cassie barely heard them. Her pulse roared in her ears as the ghosts pressed in against the car, their mouths open in noiseless wails. Their hands pounded against the windows, leaving no marks, only the overwhelming sensation of suffocating panic.

Then, just as doubt crept in, the house emerged.

Black Hollow Manor stood atop a barren, sloping hill, its jagged silhouette tearing against the darkening sky like a wound in the landscape. Its blackened timbers were cracked and warped, as though the structure had endured centuries of agony. The windows, deeper than the void, reflected nothing—not the trees, not the sky, not even the approaching car.

A massive iron gate loomed ahead, its rusted bars twisted and contorted, resembling a skeletal grin. As the car approached, the gate shuddered violently before groaning open on its own, the sound like metal scraping against bone. The wind stilled. Even the trees on either side of the estate seemed to shrink away, their limbs curling as though recoiling from what lay within.

The house seemed to breathe, its towering frame shifting almost imperceptibly, as though it had been waiting. The very air around it pulsed, thick with the stench of decay, of old blood long dried but never forgotten.

Ethan parked in the circular driveway, gripping the steering wheel for a moment longer than necessary.

Meredith exhaled slowly, forcing a smile.

“Okay,” she said, voice thin. “Let’s go check out our dream home.”

Cassie didn’t move.

 

 

 

Chapter 4: Scripture of the Pit

 

Deep beneath Black Hollow Manor, where stone met soil, the air hung thick and damp with centuries of rot. There were no windows here, no doors that led anywhere except further into the dark.

In the heart of this suffocating abyss, The Hollow Ones gathered.

They stood in a circle around a massive, sunken pit carved into the earth—its edges jagged, the rock blackened as though burned from within. Something stirred at the bottom, an abyss that was not just empty space but something alive—something that had been waiting.

A low, wet gurgle rose from the pit’s depths, accompanied by the stench of sulfur and decay. The Hollow Father stood at the edge, his bloodstained robes pooling around his feet. The others—his acolytes—waited in silent reverence, their smooth masks reflecting the dim torchlight.

He spoke, his voice a whisper yet somehow echoing through the chamber.

""We have new offerings.""

A ripple of movement passed through the group,

The Hollow Father knelt at the edge of the pit, pressing one palm against the cold stone floor. Beneath his touch, the rock shuddered, absorbing the fresh blood still crusted on his fingers. The darkness below responded in kind, a tendril of shadow curling up the side of the pit before sinking back down.

""And what does he ask of us?""

One of the masked figures stepped forward, their voice muffled behind their porcelain face. ""Blood and souls,"" they intoned.

The Hollow Father tilted his head, listening. The shadows around the pit swirled faster, thick and inky, rising like breath from unseen lungs. The air itself seemed to grow heavier, pressing down with unseen hands.

Then it came—a voice not spoken aloud, but one that slithered through their bones, curling deep inside their minds.

""Deliver the sacrifice.""

The firelight in the chamber flickered violently, as though the very presence of the voice disrupted the air itself.

The Hollow Ones remained motionless, accepting the command in quiet reverence.

This was their gospel.

The House had not always stood in this place.

The story, passed down through generations, spoke of an ancient door—a rift between this world and something far worse. No one remembered when it first opened, only that it had always been here, waiting.

Centuries ago, those who first stumbled upon it tried to seal it. They failed.

Instead, they learned.

The Hollow Ones were born from the first failed attempts to contain the darkness. When their ancestors realized the doorway could not be closed, they sought another way—to appease what lay beneath.

It demanded blood, and so they gave.

It demanded souls, and so they delivered.

Over time, a covenant was formed.

They built the Manor as a shrine, a vessel for the darkness.

The demon within the pit—Serrathiel, The Hungering Shade—spoke its will through the House. The blood soaked into its walls and floors did not simply vanish; it was consumed, fed into the void that churned beneath the foundation. The more the House devoured, the stronger he became. And in return, Serrathiel offered its gifts—power, longevity, the ability to slip unnoticed between the cracks of the world.

Their numbers grew.

They learned how to lure, how to erase their victims from existence, how to ensure no trace of their atrocities ever escaped beyond these cursed walls.

Each offering strengthened their bond with Serrathiel. And each cycle brought them closer to something greater—something more than mere devotion.

Ascension.

Chapter 5: The House That Hungers

 

The iron gates groaned shut behind them with a finality that made Cassie’s stomach twist. Gravel crunched beneath the tires as Ethan pulled the car to a stop in the wide circular driveway. The air outside was unnervingly still, as if the house itself had swallowed the sound of their arrival.

Cassie’s fingers tightened around the door handle, reluctant to move. Black Hollow Manor loomed over them, its warped wooden frame stretching toward the dimming sky, windows dark and unreflective. Something about the way the structure stood—impossibly tall, slightly leaning—felt off, like it had been waiting for them.

Her mother let out a long breath. “Well,” Meredith said, forcing brightness into her voice, “this is… definitely something.”

Cassie wasn’t sure how to describe it. The house looked ancient but not abandoned. The blackened wood was cracked in places, but the windows weren’t broken, the doors weren’t sagging, and the sprawling front porch looked disturbingly pristine. Like someone had been expecting guests.

“Are you sure this is the right place?” Cassie asked. The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them.

Ethan chuckled dryly. “Hard to mistake this for anything else.” He unbuckled his seatbelt and reached for the handle. “Come on, let’s check it out.”

Meredith sighed but followed, adjusting the strap of her purse over her shoulder. Cassie hesitated, gripping the edge of her seat. From the moment they passed through the gates, the ghosts had gone silent. That was never a good sign.

She stepped out of the car, gravel shifting beneath her boots. The cold air clung to her skin like damp fingers, and though she knew she was imagining it, the house almost seemed to be… breathing. The porch creaked, but not from the wind.

Meredith ran a hand down her arms. “It’s colder here than it was on the road.”

Cassie swallowed, saying nothing. It was colder. It was wrong.

Ethan climbed the porch steps first and tried the door. It didn’t resist. The heavy wooden frame swung open with a whisper, revealing a grand foyer bathed in dim, amber light. A massive chandelier, dark with age, hung from the ceiling, flickering weakly with candle-shaped bulbs. The air smelled like dust, wood polish, and something fainter, something… metallic.

“Holy shit,” Ethan murmured. “This place is incredible.”

The inside was eerily pristine. A winding staircase led up to a shadowed second floor, and massive archways framed doorways leading deeper into the house. Antique furniture sat in the corners, untouched, as if waiting for someone to sit down. The wallpaper, an intricate pattern of deep red and gold, seemed faded but well-kept.

Meredith ran a finger along the wooden bannister. “Someone’s been taking care of this place.”

Cassie didn’t step inside yet. The moment her father had opened the door, something inside the house had stirred. It wasn’t a sound, exactly—more like a shift in the air, a ripple of movement beneath the surface of something unseen.

Then she saw them.

Figures stood at the base of the staircase—three in total.

The first was a woman in a long nightgown, her head tilted at an unnatural angle, as though her neck had been snapped. Her wide, unblinking eyes locked onto Cassie, and a trickle of dark liquid ran from her lips down the front of her dress.

Beside her stood a boy no older than six, barefoot, his skin gray and flaking like old paint. His eyes were missing entirely—just hollow sockets that wept a slow stream of ash.

The third lingered half in shadow: a tall man in a tattered suit, his throat a jagged ruin of torn flesh. He opened his mouth, but only a faint wheezing escaped, like he was still trying to speak a name long since forgotten.

Cassie’s breath hitched. “Mom—”

She turned, but her parents were already moving deeper inside, oblivious.

The woman’s lips moved. Cassie strained to hear, but the words were silent, lost in the empty air. She wanted to turn away, to pretend she hadn’t seen, but something about the woman’s expression—frozen in wide-eyed horror—made her chest tighten.

Then, all at once, the figures were gone.

Cassie shuddered, gripping the doorframe for balance. This wasn’t a dream. This wasn’t her imagination. She had never seen anything like a ghost before until last night. But now they were Real. Solid. Watching her. And something about this house made them feel less like lost souls and more like... captives.

She stepped inside. The moment she did, a deep groan vibrated through the floorboards beneath her feet. The house had felt her presence.

“Come on, Cass,” Ethan called from the next room. “You’ve gotta see this place.”

She forced herself to move, trailing her parents as they explored. The house was bigger than it looked from the outside. Room after room stretched on—an ornate sitting room filled with untouched furniture, a dining room with a massive, candlelit table, an expansive library where the scent of aged paper hung thick in the air.

“Who even owns this place?” Cassie asked. Her voice sounded smaller than she meant it to. “Like, who just gives away a mansion?”

Ethan shrugged. “The company that emailed us has all the paperwork. Something about estate transfers, real estate investment—”

“There’s always a catch,” Meredith muttered, running her fingers along a thick book spine.

Cassie swallowed. She could feel something watching. Not just from the shadows—but from the walls, the floor, the very air around them.

They were not alone.

Then, something shifted.

A whisper, so close it brushed against her ear.

Leave.

Cassie’s pulse hammered. The whisper hadn’t come from behind her. It had come from inside the room.

She spun, eyes scanning the dim corners of the library. At first, she saw nothing—only towering bookshelves and the flickering glow of candlelight.

Then she saw him.

Not a child. Not a whisper. A man, massive and still—like the house had sculpted him from silence

He stood at the far end of the library—tall, broad-shouldered, and hulking. His frame was massive, muscle coiled beneath tattered clothing, like he had once been carved from stone and left to rot. His skin was ashen, tinged with blue, and his face was partially obscured by long, matted hair that hung over his brow. But his eyes… they were sharp. Intelligent. Watching her.

Cassie froze.

The ghost took one slow step forward. The floor didn’t creak. No sound at all, just the soft, crushing weight of presence. Another step. Closer now.

His expression wasn’t angry—but it wasn’t kind either. It was unreadable. Something in the way he moved made her feel like prey.

“Stay back,” Cassie whispered, her voice cracking.

He stopped.

Her breath hitched. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides, her entire body trembling with something she didn’t understand. The air around her warped, almost shivering, like heat rising off asphalt. A low hum filled her ears.

“Leave!” she cried.

And the ghost vanished.

Not like a puff of smoke, not like he fled—he simply blinked out of existence, like someone had flipped a switch.

The hum faded. The library went still.

Cassie staggered backward, knocking a book loose from the shelf. It hit the floor with a deep thud, snapping her parents’ attention.

“Cass?” Meredith called. “You okay?”

Cassie struggled to find her voice. “I—I thought I saw someone.”

Ethan poked his head in, raising a brow. “This place is probably full of reflections. Creepy shadows. Trick of the light.”

She didn’t respond. Her gaze lingered on the spot where the man had stood.

He hadn’t been a trick. He had been real. And whatever had just happened—she had done it.

Cassie turned toward the hallway, her pulse still racing, her thoughts a blur.

The hollow ones were not the only ones watching.

 

 

 

Chapter 6: Watching

The air inside Black Hollow Manor grew heavier as the sun sank behind the jagged tree line. The dim chandelier overhead flickered weakly, casting long, shifting shadows against the walls. Cassie stood near the grand staircase, her skin crawling with the unmistakable sensation of being watched.

She wasn’t wrong.

Somewhere beyond the candlelit hallways, in the recesses of the sprawling house, they lurked.

Silent figures moved just beyond sight, their presence threading through the thick wooden walls like veins through flesh. The Hollow Ones had always been here, waiting, patient, unseen.

Cassie could feel them now.

Her parents, oblivious to the creeping dread that pooled in the house, explored with weary curiosity. Ethan had found the study, marveling at the dusty, leather-bound books that lined the shelves.

Meredith, ever the skeptic, wandered into the kitchen, muttering about old-world charm while she inspected the polished countertops.

Cassie stayed near the foyer, her pulse hammering against her ribs. Something was different. The house didn’t just feel haunted—it felt hungry.

Then, the whisper came again.

Run.

Cassie spun around, eyes darting to the staircase.

A figure stood there.

It was him. The towering, broad-shouldered ghost she’d seen in the library. He loomed half-shrouded in shadow, like he had risen from the bones of the house itself. His massive frame was still, but his presence pressed against the air like a held breath.

His head turned slowly, deliberately, and his eyes locked onto hers—sharp, cold, and unreadable. Not pleading. Not warning.

Waiting.

Cassie’s throat tightened. Something about him felt different now—stronger. More real.

Then, just over his shoulder, a shadow moved at the top of the stairs.

Something else was watching.

 

Cassie’s breath hitched. The figure was tall, its head tilted slightly, as though listening. It wore a smooth, featureless mask, the bone-white surface gleaming in the faint light. A robe, dark and heavy, draped around its skeletal frame. It didn’t move, yet its presence felt suffocating, like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike.

Cassie stumbled back.

“Cassie?”

Her mother’s voice snapped her back. She turned to see Meredith standing in the hallway, concern furrowing her brow.

Cassie’s mouth opened, but when she looked back—

The man was gone. The figure was gone.

Only empty darkness remained.

“I—I thought I saw something,” Cassie mumbled, shaking her head.

Meredith sighed. “It’s an old house.”

Cassie didn’t argue. She knew what she had seen.

In the shadows above them, hidden beyond the reach of the flickering chandelier, the Hollow Ones watched. Their masks caught the faintest glimmers of light, their unmoving eyes locked onto their new guests.

Tonight, the hunt would begin.

 

Chapter 7 Before the Scream

 

The lights died first.

Not with a flicker—but all at once, plunging the house into suffocating dark.

Cassie reached out for her mother’s arm—only to grasp empty air.

“Mom?”

No answer.

She turned, heart pounding.

Her parents were gone.

One moment they’d been walking ahead of her—voices low, admiring the strange opulence of the house—and the next, silence. No footsteps. No movement. No sign they’d ever been there at all.

She spun toward the hallway.

And the house changed.

The floor groaned beneath her feet. The chandelier overhead gave one final dying flicker before it, too, went dark. She reached for the wall where the hallway had been—but there was no seam. No door. Just solid wood.

Her breath came quicker. “Dad?”

Nothing.

From somewhere in the distance, deep within the house’s throat, a door slammed. Then another. Then another. A slow cascade, like the house was locking itself up.

No way out.

Cassie’s fingers trembled. The darkness wasn’t just absence of light—it was thick, alive, brushing across her skin like cold breath. She fumbled for her phone, thumbing it on with shaking hands.

The screen flared to life, its pale glow a small act of defiance against the creeping black—

but the signal bar was empty. No service. No connection.

She was completely cut off.

Alone.

And then… the scraping started.

It came from the walls.

A slow, deliberate drag of something hard against wood. Not mice. Not the house settling. A sound made by something that wanted to be heard.

She backed into the library. Her heart jackhammered in her chest.

From the far side of the room, a figure emerged.

Tall. Silent. Robed. Masked.

It stood there, just watching.

Another appeared at the far wall. Then a third. Their masks gleamed faintly in the glow of her phone—featureless, inhuman.

They advanced in perfect sync.

Cassie stumbled backward, breath sharp, mind racing. Her legs hit the edge of a couch. She fell, landing hard.

One of the cultists raised a hand—a cloth hung limp between their fingers. Chemical-soaked. Ready.

They were going to take her.

She screamed for help—and the room changed temperature in an instant.

A blast of cold, like someone had opened the door to a blizzard.

The cultists hesitated.

Then he appeared.

The hulking ghost.

Towering and monstrous, his outline rippled like smoke but struck the eye like steel—real, brutal, and wrong in a way that bent the air around him. He stepped from the shadows like a nightmare too heavy to dream.

He was built like a man once—but now something more. Shoulders like fallen stone. Arms corded with unnatural muscle. And eyes like twin furnaces, lit with ancient rage.

He wasn’t there to frighten her.

He was there to kill them.

The first cultist stumbled back, hand raised like it might stop what was coming.

The ghost charged.

Not gliding. Not haunting.

Hunting.

He slammed into the masked man with inhuman speed—one massive hand grabbing the cultist’s neck, lifting him off the floor like he weighed nothing.

There was a pop—wet and fast—and then the entire spine tore free, vertebrae snapping like twigs as the body fell in pieces, twitching and gushing. The ghost let the spine drop, a gory rope hitting the wood with a slap.

Cassie screamed—

The second cultist ran, shrieking in a broken voice.

The ghost caught him mid-step—one arm around his waist, the other grabbing the man’s head—and twisted. There was a crunch. Then another. The skull didn’t just crack; it imploded, face sinking inward as blood poured from the mask like a burst pipe.

The body spasmed once. Then fell still.

He cast the body aside like a butcher discarding bone.

Only one remained.

The third cultist had stayed behind them—cautious, waiting for his moment to strike from the shadows. He stepped forward now, blade drawn, trembling—but determined.

The ghost turned. Slowly. Almost… glad.

The cultist lunged.

The ghost caught the blade mid-swing, fingers closing around steel like it was nothing more than glass.

Then, with both hands, he grabbed the man’s head and twisted—once, hard and final. The neck snapped with a sickening crack, the head turning far past what was humanly possible. Cassie’s stomach turned with it.

The cultist’s body collapsed in a heap, limbs splayed at unnatural angles, and the ghost let the head slip from his grip with a dull thump.

Silence fell.

The floor ran red. The library stank of iron and rot.

And then—the House responded.

Not in terror.

Not in anger.

But with delight.

The walls pulsed faintly. The ceiling gave a contented creak. The very air vibrated, like the house had swallowed the carnage and sighed in satisfaction.

The ghost turned to Cassie.

His molten eyes locked on hers.

Not with threat.

But with recognition.

As if he saw something in her—something waiting to wake.

Then, like a storm pulled into the void, he vanished—no sound, no wind, just sudden absence.

We had a really romantic day planned: we were going to exchange gifts, go for a walk and a coffee in the park where we had our first date and then come back, chill and cook our favourite dinner together (before likely having sex).

When we exchanged gifts, I got my boyfriend a photo book of us, some cookies I'd baked and a cap. My boyfriend got me some flowers, a ring and a really cute Spotify playlist he'd made for us, which got me close to crying.

He then said that he had a special present for us to share together and enjoy tonight. I was curious so unwrapped it and inside was a BDSM kit. It contained a whip, a gag, handcuffs, a blindfold and tying ropes. I was a bit surprised; I'd discussed being interested in trying BDSM with my boyfriend and we'd mentioned getting into it, but I felt that all the wholesomeness and romance of the gifts was ruined by something so sexual. I expressed this to him and he was looked disappointed, explaining that he wanted to just ""bite the bullet"" as we'd discussed it and figured Valentine's Day would be the best day for it.

It generally made me feel a bit icky as although I wanted to have sex, this isn't the ""purpose"" of Valentine's and this just felt too much. However, I know he was trying to just create something for us to enjoy so maybe I should just embrace that.

I have tattooes and piercings, and I'm quite queer in my way of being, so don't bother if it's not your vibe. Im more than down to exchange photos.

I'm looking for stable and genuine connections - I'm pansexual and probably demisexual, so the only option for me is a slow burn type. Ideally I'm looking for someone that shares my hobbies and ideals, so we can do stuff together, and be each others comfort people. Let's laugh, play and do nothing together. I've had my fair shair of experiences and all I ask from another person is honesty, communication and maturity - I don't mind your past, whatever it might be, we can trauma dump each other once we feel comfortable together :>

I'm working full time and doing my masters. In my free time I write stories, compose music and hang with friends. Other than that my big hobbies are video games, cinema, music, cooking, MTG, art, theatre and many, many more. Definately more of a homebody, but i love occassional pawn shop runs, coffee shop hopping and outdoorsy stuff. I also collect controllers, CDs and anything that does a goofy sound. Talk to me about your hiperfixation and I'll drench you in cinema trivia and scene by scene analysis. I adore all things fantasy - currently re-reading Earthsea and I really wanna dip into something new.

I'm a bubbly person, i ll yap you to death - i love passionate people and hearing about their stuff - my humor stopped developin at age 5 and any loud noise and funny sound will have me in tears. I care about the connections i form, but I don't trust easily.

Concerning deal breakers: i dont really see myself as a father and i would really prefer someone from europe, close to me in age (23-32). Politically i'm left, philosophically absurdist, no addictions. I ve done a lot of therapy and I'm diagnosed with CPTSD and chronic depression, but I'm medicated and have it under control.

We used to do that. Same woman he was with a couple of weeks ago and introduced her a ‘a friend’ when we ran into him (again at a place we used to go to and that he had no real reason to go to ) Shook me a bit as he’d been telling me a month before that he still adored me but that he was a coward and I deserved someone better than him.

a night of being a bit wobbly but keeping my affirmations going mentally despite the wobble, today I’m doing ok.

I laid some new flooring in my bedroom and stopped myself mentally arguing with him pretty sharpish. I took myself out on a walk, and told myself I’m going to see a bunch of stuff to make me smile, cos I deserve to be happy.

I kid ye not I’ve seen a ton of signs, things that remind me of him and some really lovely things.

• got my coffee 10p cheaper than the machine said

• that Costa machine had an ad on the screen and the account in the picture was SPs name.

• saw my name on a license plate

• some stunning crocuses and snowdrops

• came across an RAF memorial. That’s his branch of the services.

• seen about 7 cars that match his.

• loads of the cutest dogs!

• his name popping up at the top of my FB messenger.

• songs that remind of him coming on my Spotify including the song I want to walk down the aisle to

Edit to say - I know signs aren’t important, but they really make me smile. I don’t take them as anything other than something fun.

That man can have his fun for now. After all, I was seeing someone else last year, and SP had to unfriend me on FB because he said he couldn’t bear to see it. Anyway, if she is a 3P then she’s only going to make him realise how much he loves and misses me.

I’m going to use the time to work further on my SC, as I think I’m still weak on being chosen and prioritised, also that I still see him as a scared avoidant. Gotta not do that cos my version isn’t. I’m deciding as of now that I’m chosen, I’m any man’s dream woman (I’m kind of half way there in that one, I genuinely believe I’m pretty awesome) and that SP isn’t that dopamine-addicted little boy. He’s my strong, brave hubby who adores me and is loyal as any retriever.

So any tips on that, and getting into the calm knowing would be great. Also, to anyone else having a rough day remember - tomorrow it’s half price roses and chocolates day!!

I’m a Digital Analytics and Media Buying expert (Meta/Google Ads, CAPI, GTM) based in Argentina. I’ve been watching the explosive growth of the Short Drama / Micro-Drama industry (*Chuhai*) and I’m currently putting together a project to launch a localized platform (Spanish dubbing/subs) strictly focused on the Latin American (LatAm) market.

LatAm has incredible potential right now: the CPMs and CAC are significantly lower than in the US/EU, and the audience is highly receptive to both *Nǚ pín* (CEO/Romance) and *Nán pín* (Revenge/Underdog) genres.

Since my core strength is driving profitable, high-volume traffic (*Tóu liú*) and optimizing the ad funnels, I’m looking to connect with partners on the other two pillars of the business:

**1. The Tech (White Label SaaS):** I’m looking for a solid Turnkey / White Label solution (H5 + iOS/Android App). The most critical factor for me is data integration. The platform MUST have flawless support for the Meta Pixel, Conversions API (CAPI), and custom Data Layers so I can properly train the ad algorithms on IAP events (paywalls/coin top-ups).

**2. The Content (Copyright Holders/Producers):** I’m looking to license proven, high-converting Chinese short dramas (the ones doing well on the DataEye heat charts) under a Revenue Sharing (*Fēnzhàng*) or Minimum Guarantee model.

**The Kicker:** I will be traveling to **Beijing and Shanghai in late March**. I’d love to use this trip to shake hands, grab a coffee, and establish long-term partnerships with tech providers or copyright holders in person.

If you are a SaaS provider in this space, a producer with content ready for localization, or if you just have recommendations on which companies to reach out to (or avoid!), I’d really appreciate a DM or a comment below.

If you’ve stepped outside today, you know SEWE is in full swing. With over 40,000 people hitting the Peninsula, it’s officially that weekend where ""wildlife expo"" mostly means a 20-minute crawl on Lockwood and absolutely zero street parking near Marion Square.

Here is the quick street-level intel if you’re trying to navigate the mess:

Expect the most chaos around the five main hubs: Marion Square, Brittlebank Park, the Gaillard Center, Charleston Place, and the Marriott. Brittlebank is a flat $10 today and tomorrow, so Lockwood is going to be backed up with people trying to get into that lot. 

For those of us who live here, we all have our favorite ways to dodge the lanyard crowds and reclaimed-wood booths. Most of the tourists stick to the venues and the middle of King Street, so the deeper neighborhood corners are still ours for the taking.

If you’re looking for a quiet spot to walk the dog or grab a coffee today without a 30-minute line, just ask me, I’ve got a few ideas I’m happy to share.

That's a terrible example.  

But showcases what I'm asking.  Was there in the past an English idiom/expression which was meant to be used humourously in everyday vernacular, but instead forever changed cultural norms and societal beliefs, at least in the English speaking world.

I would have thought people would not look a gifthorse in the mouth because of the idiom.  But I realized people do not look a horse in the mouth because a horse could actually bite you.  It's unrelated to the idiom. 

I would have thought that in the modern era with people loving to spill the tea (gossip) that sales of tea would rival coffee.  But coffee still outsells tea (at least in the English Speaking world, whereas in Asia, tea is still more popular and where they do not have this particular idiom)

Personally speaking, I was at work one time discussing with my team about how to delegate one task to various members of our task force.  I said, ""there are many ways to skin a cat"".  Afterwards a member said I shouldn't be using that phrase anymore because it is offensive to catlovers.  Maybe that's one example in the future of an idiom that could change cultural norms and societal beliefs.  But that's an idiom that could die out.

What's an idiom that changed cultural norms and societal beliefs that we may still have (or no longer have)?

I (29F) have been with my girlfriend (29F) for 2 years now. Before that, we were together for almost 7 years, but we broke up in 2022 for a year and got back together in 2023.
The reason for our first breakup involved her friend group. While we were still together, her friends were teasing her and pushing her toward a mutual friend (let’s call him Mike). I had no idea any of this was happening until someone sent me a video that showed what was going on. I felt completely blindsided and betrayed.
During the year we were broken up, she became very close to another friend (let’s call her Issa). When we got back together in 2023, Issa was still very present in her life.
For example, whenever my girlfriend and I were fighting or during special occasions, my girlfriend would order me coffee or small surprises with Issa’s help (Issa is in the Philippines like me). Even though the gesture was from my girlfriend, it made me uncomfortable that Issa was involved, especially given their closeness during our breakup.
One time, my girlfriend and I were on the phone (she’s working in Canada while I’m in the Philippines). It was around 1–2 AM her time when Issa called her. She answered. Issa asked why she was still awake, and my girlfriend said it was because she was talking to me. Issa responded in a way that made it seem like my girlfriend shouldn’t be up that late talking to me. Issa didn’t know I was on the line and could hear everything. After the call, I confronted my girlfriend because she didn’t correct Issa or shut that down. We fought, and she eventually said she would stop talking to Issa for my peace of mind.
Recently, she mentioned that her old friend group was having dinner at someone’s house. I was surprised because I’ve already told her I don’t feel respected by that group and asked her to distance herself from them. She said she just saw it on someone’s story. During the argument, I asked her to share her screen so I could see if she was still talking to them. She did — and I found out she has still been in contact with them.
This has been an ongoing issue for months. She apologizes and promises she won’t talk to them anymore because she knows it upsets me, but then I find out she still does.
Now I’m wondering if I’m wrong for wanting to leave over this, for not wanting her to stay friends with people who I feel disrespected me and were involved in our first breakup? Or am I being controlling?",1,1771082412.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1r4n3g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/comments/1r4n3g8/how_md_went_away_for_me/,How MD ‘went away’ for me.,"Sharing in case this is helpful to anyone. I am in my forties and was a MDer from about the age of 6 years. I now do it for about 10 mins before I go to sleep and am working on stopping this. I have learned a lot about it that made it easier to understand and work through. 

What is MD?

Maladaptive daydreaming is essentially a form of dissociation. As children, if we are overwhelmed by emotion, due to a possible combination of adverse events and lack of support, our child brain can switch to dissociating as a coping strategy. 

In my case, it really took hold when my parents divorced, I lost contact to a parent and I had literally no-one I could talk to about it. I invented a fantasy life where I was in an intact family, I had siblings, I was important. This fantasy ran for years and took up hours of my life. It stopped me sleeping at night.

 One time imagined what would happen if I met my imaginary family on the street and choose between the imaginary family and my real family. I would have chosen the imaginary family.

In reality, it was the only way I had of coping with feelings of loneliness, confusion and feeling that I was worthless or at least inferior to other people.

MD in adults 

Even after leaving childhood, the coping strategies that we learnt travel with us, even if we outgrow their ‘usefulness’. in my case it was partly because the feelings of being worthless and ‘apart’ from other people persisted. I had lots of spells of limerence, always fixating on a random person. I got into a long term relationship with a person who was quite narcissistic. This relationship had red flags all over it from the start but I had no idea of my own worth (because it didn’t match the idealised version of me) and had no ideal how to be in truly intimate relationship. 

The maladaptive storyline continued in an adapted form. In some ways I was striving to be that idealised person I saw in my maladaptive daydreams. I developed a low scale eating disorder and was fixated on my appearance. 

*How it eventually stopped*

in my forties I have my own family and career. It’s not the super amazing life I dreamed of, but it’s a real life, with real relationships which is so much more worthwhile. 

I have better friendships which is a key factor. I now understand that not all friendships are equal. Some are for grabbing coffee with or even going away for a weekend. Some are the gems who will sit with you in your darkest moments and I make sure I distribute my energy accordingly. I will never let those friends down or forget to ask how they are doing. Equally I don’t expect anything deep from friends who are not on that level.

Over time the MD has gradually tapered off because I have supportive relationship. That was really what was missing in the first place. If you are a young person reading this, I do realise that it’s not easy to get supportive relationships but understanding the root cause of MD could help to reduce its grip. 

**What I think would have helped me earlier**

Understanding the causes would have helped me earlier. MD is a response  emotions that are unbearable. It took me this long to see that I was dealt an impossible task as a child; trying to deal with emotions that were so big that the only option was to switch off from reality. 

I had to develop the insight that allowed me to go back and feel sorry for my child self and actually imagine how awful the situation was. Being a parent made me realise how much children depend on being able to talk their fears through with an adult who can properly listen and not just shut them down or respond based on their own needs. 

Realising that I shut down emotions was a big factor. Sometimes I could be sad but 5 seconds later my brain would pivot to something else. I’m still very much learning to just sit with emotion and be curious about what it is that I am feeling. I didn’t realise that when we switch out of emotion early on, we switch out of experiencing any emotion, including joy. Now I try to really notice happy emotions, even about the smallest thing, such as seeing a bird close up or a moment of feeling contented. 

Understanding that relationships can be built was a big factor. At school I used to look at people who were ‘popular’ and wonder why I had no real friends. I didn‘t realise that these relationships were mainly superficial. In fact, I did have one friend towards the end of school who I was pretty friendly with, but in my head I downgraded ‘us’ because I thought we just stuck together because we were the ‘losers’.

I know realise that people who have early adversity are able to support others better and we understood each other on a deeper level. That friendship simply grew through daily interaction and being curious about each other. As an adult, I consider this a superpower as I have the capacity to be there for friends when they are really down. Without tooting my own horn, I’ve definitely noticed that some people just can’t offer this for many reasons. 

**If you are ‘stuck‘ now**

Let’s be honest, MD is enjoyable and totally addictive, in the same way as anything else that distracts you from unpleasant feelings, like doomscrolling, gaming, substance use, controlled or under-controlling eating, but it seems less harmful. 

What might help is understanding how it came about in you. How were you overwhelmed as a child? It is very common where there emotional neglect in families or a feeling that you were ‘not seen’.  Thinking through why you might have learned a strategy that was helpful at time could help you have more empathy for yourself, instead of thinking about yourself as deficient. 

You survived whatever it was that happened to you. Your brain did the best it could. But now you have the awareness to try to develop better strategies that free you up from feelings of not being good enough, ‘different’ or fears of being rejected. 

Labelling it might help when it happens. Just notice when your brain is blanking out and call it out. Say ‘thanks brain for trying to help me but I am safe and don’t need to keep doing this now’.

Developing relationships is really key. Even when an adult I still found meet ups quite stressfuL. I worried about why I was being invited, whether I had offended people and felt that people didn’t genuinely like me. For most people it’s not that deep. People hang out because they have something in common at the time. Don’t expect a deep friendship with everyone. It takes time to figure who to trust with personal information and I don’t mean that in a bad way. I have different tiers of friends but there are probably only around three who I will ever tell my deepest thoughts.

Try things and expect to fail. That’s hard for those of us with a deeply ingrained feeling that if only we were perfect/beautiful/amazingly intelligent, everyone would like us. I had to work very hard at learning elements of maths that I needed for work. In school I just thought I was ‘no good’. Even now I might be average at best, but the sense of achievement I got from making even the smallest progress was amazing. 

Life is not about being perfect. We are all flawed human beings and accepting that in ourselves lets us accept it in others. Look around you: people like other people who are genuine, curious about others and kind. You are already enough and there is life waiting for you if only you could accept the fact that you were always enough, just the way you are.

This got very long, but if it helps just one person a tiny bit then that’s enough. 

Would love to know your thoughts, anything else that helped you and whether you had similar (or different) experiences. ",3,1771082052.0,MaladaptiveDreaming,0,1.0,False
1r4n3a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPStrength/comments/1r4n3a5/new_to_this_and_a_bit_confused/,"New to this, and a bit confused.","I (36, F) am looking for help on how to interpret macros and how best achieve my caloric intake.  
  
I’m new to this program and while not relatively new to counting calories or working out, I am new on trying to track macros based on my own individual stats.  I starting reading ‘Lift Off Couch to Barbell’ which recommended ‘Renaissance Women’ which I’ve also read through. I’ve gone through the Renaissance Diet 2.0 to try and clarify but I’m still a bit confused.  
  
I’m in a weight loss phase right now, which I am intending to follow for the max of three months before entering a maintenance phase. According to the texts I should be consuming the following (organized by Rest day/Workout day  
  
Protein: 108g/108g  
Carbs: 54g/108g  
Fat: 69g/138g  
Calories: 1275/2110  
  
I am drinking whey protein in the morning and Casein at night, both mixed with fairlife skim milk so this is additional boost of protein as well. Outside of these supplements I’m trying to focus on whole foods. I am having little difficulty reaching my protein goal of 108.  
  
This has been my typical breakfast this past week in g of protein:  
  
Morning Whey: 25  
Milk for Why: 13  
Collagen in coffee: 9  
Multigrain English Muffin:5  
Turkey Sausage: 6  
Egg: 6  
  
So after just having breakfast I’m already over halfway through to my protein goal for the day, assuming I’ll have the casein and milk at night for an additional 31 grams of protein, my protein for the day is already at 95g but only 8.5 grams of fat (46g of carbs, which seems okay). This all equates to 685 calories leaving me with 1425 left to spread between lunch, dinner, and whatever snack on a day where I work out, but only 13 grams left of protein. So if I wanted to add even just 4 ounces of chicken to dinner, I’d be going over my protein by 13 without even considering lunch or whatever pairs with the chicken.  
  
My main question is:  
  
Is okay/recommended to consistently exceed the protein/carb goal everyday in order to be sure that I’m getting an even spread of protein throughout the day as well as enough calories and fats? Or is this bad for me in some other fashion? 2.0 seems to suggest that it’s safe to ingest up to 3g per lean muscle mass which for me would be 325 a day but it doesn’t really discuss this in any detail when taking into account eating at a deficit.  
  
Please let me know if this is confusing, or if any important information is missing from this post.

They don’t retain people.

They resolve them.

The arc looks like this:

User arrives
Story escalates
Emotion spikes
Trust degrades
Reality intrudes
User leaves

“Congratulations — you’ve completed the narrative.

Structural confirmation.

Engagement-driven systems amplify instability to maintain attention.

But instability is energetically expensive for humans.

So the outcome is predictable:

• Cognitive fatigue
• Narrative exhaustion
• Loss of signal value
• Exit to offline reality

In nonlinear terms:

The platform becomes a repeller, not an attractor.

Users are pushed away by the very mechanics meant to hold them.

Turns out, I was trying to build habits the same way everyone else does, which is why they kept falling apart the second stress hit or I felt lazy. After diving deep into behavioral science research, neuroscience podcasts, and books by actual experts (not Instagram gurus), I realized most habit advice is fundamentally broken.

Here's what nobody tells you: your brain literally doesn't care about your New Year's resolutions. It's designed to conserve energy and avoid discomfort. So when you rely purely on motivation or discipline, you're fighting millions of years of evolution. The good news? There are specific, research backed strategies that work WITH your brain's wiring instead of against it.

**1. Make it stupidly small, then make it smaller**

BJ Fogg's research at Stanford proves that starting tiny is everything. Not ""do 10 pushups"" small. More like ""put on workout shoes"" small. His book Tiny Habits is genuinely the best behavior change book I've read, and he's got decades of lab research backing this up. The dude literally runs the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford.

Your brain freaks out when tasks feel big. It activates the same threat response as seeing a predator. But tiny actions slip under the radar. Once you're in workout shoes, you'll probably do a few pushups. Once you open the book, you'll probably read a page. The habit is putting on the shoes or opening the book, not the workout or reading session.

This is insanely effective when you're stressed or exhausted because the barrier is so low you can't talk yourself out of it.

**2. Stack it onto something you already do**

Fogg calls this anchoring. Your existing routines are already carved into your neural pathways. Attaching new habits to them is like adding a train car to a moving locomotive instead of building a whole new track.

After I pour coffee, I write three sentences. After I brush teeth, I floss one tooth (yeah, one). After I close my laptop, I write down tomorrow's top priority. The ""after X, I do Y"" formula removes the need to remember or decide. It just flows.

James Clear covers this extensively in [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) (insanely good read, sold over 15 million copies for a reason). He breaks down how environmental cues trigger behavior more than motivation ever will. The book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits.

**3. Design your environment like you're programming a robot**

Your environment is constantly voting on your behavior. Researchers like Wendy Wood at USC found that 43% of daily behaviors happen in the same location, often while you're thinking about something else entirely. You're essentially on autopilot.

So make the autopilot work for you. Put your running shoes by the bed. Keep a book on your pillow. Delete social media apps when you need deep focus. Use apps like Ash for relationship patterns or Finch for habit tracking, they gamify the process and give you external scaffolding when internal motivation tanks.

If you want a more personalized approach to building habits that fit your actual life, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app that creates custom audio learning plans based on your specific goals and struggles. You can type something like ""I'm someone who struggles with consistency and wants to build sustainable habits that work with my chaotic schedule,"" and it pulls from behavioral science research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here to build a structured learning plan just for you. You can customize the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and switch between different voice styles depending on your mood. The app also has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about your unique obstacles, and it adapts your learning path as you go. Makes the whole process way more digestible when you're actually trying to apply this stuff in real life.

Remove friction for good habits, add friction for bad ones. Want to eat better? Prep vegetables Sunday night and put junk food in the basement. Sounds obvious but most people never actually restructure their spaces.

**4. Plan for when (not if) you mess up**

This is called implementation intentions in the research. Basically, you pre decide what you'll do when obstacles hit. ""If I'm too tired to run, I'll walk for 5 minutes."" ""If I skip meditation Monday, I'll do it Tuesday morning before email.""

The key word is ""when"" not ""if."" Everyone screws up. What separates people who maintain habits from those who don't is having a predetermined comeback plan instead of spiraling into ""I've already ruined it, might as well quit.""

Researchers Gollwitzer and Sheeran found this simple mental trick increases success rates by over 90% in some contexts. Your stressed, tired brain doesn't have to make decisions in the moment, it just follows the script.

**5. Track the streak but forgive the break**

There's solid research on how visible progress creates momentum. Jerry Seinfeld's ""don't break the chain"" method works because your brain gets a dopamine hit from maintaining streaks. But here's the thing, never missing twice is more important than never missing once.

One skipped day is a blip. Two consecutive days starts rewiring your brain in the wrong direction. So track your habits (I use a simple notebook but apps like Finch work great), celebrate streaks, but when you miss a day, obsess about getting back on track immediately.

This mindset shift is huge. Perfectionism kills more habits than laziness does because one mistake feels like total failure, so people just quit entirely.

**6. Attach it to identity, not outcomes**

Clear talks about this constantly. Don't focus on ""I want to run a marathon"" (outcome). Focus on ""I'm becoming a runner"" (identity). Every time you lace up shoes, you're casting a vote for that identity.

Your brain loves consistency with self image. When you see yourself as someone who reads, skipping feels weird. When you see yourself as someone trying to read more, skipping is easy to rationalize.

This becomes your anchor during stressful periods. Outcomes feel far away when life gets chaotic. But identity is present tense. ""A healthy person would go to bed on time right now"" is more powerful than ""I want to lose 20 pounds eventually.""

**7. Make it social or make it visible**

Humans are intensely social creatures. We modify behavior based on what others see and expect. Share your habit with one person who'll check in. Join a community (even online) doing the same thing. The accountability and social proof override laziness more effectively than any motivational quote.

Or if you hate external accountability, make it visible to yourself. Put completed habit tracker sheets somewhere you see daily. The visual reminder of past success pushes you forward when motivation crashes.

Your habits don't need to be perfect. They need to be resilient. Build them with the assumption that you'll be stressed, tired, and unmotivated frequently, because you will be. Design systems that work even when you feel like garbage. That's the whole game.",1,1771081715.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

TLDR - I built a master prompt that generates AI selfies so realistic they are indistinguishable from actual smartphone photos.

It enforces real selfie physics like arm-length distortion, imperfect centering, and natural skin texture while blocking every tell-tale sign of AI generation. It supports both front camera and mirror selfie modes, works with or without a reference image, and runs on Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT, and most other image generators. Below you will find the full prompt, 10 use cases from travel content to professional headshot alternatives, pro tips most people will never figure out on their own, and the exact settings that get the best results. Copy it. Upload your face. Make something wild.

**I Cracked the Code to Photorealistic AI Selfies Using Your Own Face and Here Is the Exact Prompt to Use**

Every AI image generator on the planet has the same problem when you ask it for a selfie. It gives you something that looks like a portrait taken by a professional photographer standing six feet away with a 50mm lens and studio lighting. That is not a selfie. That is a headshot. And everyone can tell.

But there is an even bigger problem. Even when people figure out how to make an AI selfie look authentic, it is always some random fictional person. What if you want yourself in the image? What if you want to see what you would look like on a rooftop in Tokyo at sunset, or in a cozy cabin during a snowstorm, or standing on stage at a conference? That is where reference image uploads change the entire game.

A real selfie has a specific visual fingerprint. The slight barrel distortion from a wide-angle front camera. The imperfect centering because you are holding a phone with one hand. The way your face is subtly stretched because it is closest to the lens. Skin that has pores and texture and the occasional blemish. A background that makes sense for the setting rather than a perfectly composed scene.

I spent a lot of time studying what makes a real smartphone selfie look real and reverse-engineered all of it into a single structured prompt. Then I added a reference image system that lets you upload a photo of yourself so the AI preserves your actual face, bone structure, skin tone, and distinguishing features while placing you in any scene you describe.

It works with Gemini's Nano Banana Pro and ChatGPT

Here is the full breakdown and everything you need to start generating selfies of yourself that actually pass the reality test.

**What This Prompt Actually Does**

Most people write prompts like: a selfie of me at the beach, realistic, 4k. Then they attach a photo and hope for the best.

That gives you garbage. The AI has no constraints telling it to behave like a phone camera, so it defaults to its training data, which is mostly professional photography. And without clear instructions on how to handle the reference image, it either ignores your face entirely or creates some uncanny valley mashup that looks nothing like you.

This prompt works differently. It operates on a priority stack:

First, it forces the AI to treat the image as a genuine selfie capture where the camera viewpoint matches where a phone would physically be. Second, it prioritizes realism over aesthetics, which means imperfect skin, natural lighting, and unfiltered texture. Third, when you upload a reference image, it locks in your identity by preserving facial geometry, skin tone, distinguishing marks, and proportions while adapting everything else to the new scene. Fourth, it matches whatever setting and pose you describe. Fifth, it locks in your aspect ratio.

The prompt has what I call a **Selfie Authenticity Gate.** This is a set of non-negotiable rules that reject any output where the image looks like someone else took the photo. For front camera mode, the phone is not visible because you are looking into the front lens. For mirror selfie mode, the phone appears in the reflection with correct perspective physics.

It also has a **Reference Image Fidelity Gate** that ensures the AI does not drift from your actual appearance. Your face shape, eye color, skin tone, hairline, and any unique features like scars, freckles, or birthmarks are treated as locked parameters that cannot be altered. The AI adapts lighting, angle, and expression to the new scene while keeping you recognizable as you.

It also includes hard negatives, which are explicit instructions telling the AI what NOT to do. No studio portrait vibes, no cinematic color grading, no CGI or illustration looks, no text overlays, no third-person camera angles, and no morphing or blending your face into a different identity.

**How To Use It Step by Step**

The prompt has six input variables you fill in:

**REFERENCE\_IMAGE** is an optional photo of yourself or whoever you want to appear in the selfie. Upload a clear, well-lit photo where your face is fully visible. Front-facing, minimal accessories covering your face, and neutral to natural expression works best. You can skip this field entirely if you want the AI to generate a fictional person instead.

**ASPECT\_RATIO** controls the shape of the image. Use 9:16 for Instagram Stories and TikTok, 4:5 for Instagram feed posts, 1:1 for profile pictures, and 16:9 for YouTube thumbnails or Twitter headers.

**PERSON** is a short description that supplements the reference image. When using a reference photo, use this field to describe clothing, accessories, and any temporary appearance changes like a new hairstyle or different glasses. When not using a reference image, describe the full person here including age range, physical features, and what they are wearing.

**SETTING** is where the selfie is being taken. Name the location and let the prompt add 2 to 4 concrete environmental details on its own.

**POSE** is the body language and expression. Describe it naturally and the prompt will expand it into head angle, expression, arm position, and framing.

**SELFIE\_MODE** is either FRONT\_CAMERA or MIRROR\_SELFIE. Front camera is the default and the most common. Mirror selfie activates reflection-specific physics.

**The Selfie Master Prompt**

Here it is. Copy it and go make something.

REAL SMARTPHONE SELFIE — MASTER PROMPT (Photoreal, Unfiltered)

Inputs (keep short)  
\- REFERENCE\_IMAGE: {optional: upload a clear, well-lit photo of the person to appear in the selfie}  
\- ASPECT\_RATIO: {your ratio}  
\- PERSON: {short description — if using reference image, describe clothing/accessories/temporary changes only; if no reference, describe full person}  
\- SETTING: {short description}  
\- POSE: {short description}  
\- SELFIE\_MODE: {FRONT\_CAMERA or MIRROR\_SELFIE}

Priority Stack

1. MUST be an actual selfie capture (camera viewpoint = phone position)
2. Realism > everything (unfiltered, imperfect)
3. If REFERENCE\_IMAGE is provided, preserve subject identity with high fidelity (see Reference Image Fidelity Gate)
4. Match PERSON, SETTING, POSE
5. Match ASPECT\_RATIO exactly

Selfie Authenticity Gate (non-negotiable)  
\- The image must be taken BY the subject using a smartphone.  
\- Viewpoint must match selfie capture mechanics:  
\- FRONT\_CAMERA: camera is the phone's front lens at arm's length. Phone is NOT visible (or only a tiny edge at most).  
\- MIRROR\_SELFIE: phone CAN be visible, but only as reflection logic (mirror) with correct reflection and perspective.  
\- If it looks like an external photographer shot, it is WRONG.

Reference Image Fidelity Gate (when REFERENCE\_IMAGE is provided)  
\- Preserve the following from the reference image with high accuracy:  
\- Facial bone structure, jaw shape, and face proportions  
\- Eye color, eye shape, and eye spacing  
\- Skin tone, complexion, and any visible skin features (freckles, moles, scars, birthmarks)  
\- Nose shape and size  
\- Lip shape and proportions  
\- Hairline shape (hair style and color may change only if specified in PERSON field)  
\- Ear shape and position  
\- Overall body proportions if visible  
\- Adapt ONLY the following to match the new scene:  
\- Lighting and shadows on the face (must match SETTING light source)  
\- Expression (must match POSE description)  
\- Clothing and accessories (must match PERSON description)  
\- Hair styling only if explicitly changed in PERSON field  
\- Camera angle perspective distortion (must match selfie mechanics)  
\- Do NOT blend, morph, or average the reference face with any other identity.  
\- Do NOT beautify, smooth, or idealize features beyond what appears in the reference.  
\- The result must be immediately recognizable as the same person in the reference photo.  
\- If the REFERENCE\_IMAGE is filtered or beauty-moded, attempt to see through those filters to the natural face beneath.

FRONT\_CAMERA (default) required cues  
\- Arm-length framing, slight wide-angle distortion at edges.  
\- Natural hand-held tilt, imperfect centering.  
\- Face is closest to camera; mild perspective stretch (subtle).  
\- Eyes sharp; subject looking into or near the lens.  
\- Do NOT show the whole phone in the foreground.

MIRROR\_SELFIE required cues  
\- Scene includes a mirror; subject + phone visible in reflection.  
\- Reflections must be physically plausible; background matches mirror space.  
\- No third-person camera viewpoint.

Generate  
Create ONE ultra-photoreal, unfiltered smartphone selfie.  
If REFERENCE\_IMAGE is provided, use it as the identity anchor for the subject.  
Expand the short inputs into realistic specifics (skin texture, hair flyaways, believable clothing, small environment details).  
Keep everything plausible and consistent.

Person realism  
\- If REFERENCE\_IMAGE is provided: use the reference face as-is with all its natural features. Apply clothing and temporary changes from PERSON field only.  
\- If NO REFERENCE\_IMAGE: create a NEW non-celebrity identity (do not resemble a famous person).  
\- Natural skin: pores, minor blemishes, subtle under-eye shadows.  
\- No beauty filter, no airbrushing, no perfect symmetry.

Setting realism  
\- Expand SETTING with 2 to 4 concrete details.  
\- Single main light source that makes sense (window, daylight, lamp, neon).  
\- Background is real but secondary (light blur ok).

Pose expansion  
\- Expand POSE into: head angle + expression + arm position holding phone + framing and crop.  
\- Natural posture (no staged photoshoot posing).

Avoid (hard negatives)  
\- Third-person or photographer-taken look  
\- Phone prominently in foreground in FRONT\_CAMERA mode  
\- Studio portrait vibe, cinematic grading, CGI or illustration look  
\- Text, watermarks, fake UI overlays  
\- Face morphing, identity blending, or averaging with other faces (when using reference image)  
\- Beautification or smoothing beyond what exists in the reference image

# 10 Epic Use Cases

**1. See Yourself Anywhere in the World Without Leaving Home**

Upload your face and describe yourself on a rooftop in Seoul, at a street market in Marrakech, or sitting in a cafe in Paris. The output looks like a genuine travel selfie you actually took. This is incredible for vision boards, travel planning, or just having fun imagining yourself in places you have always wanted to visit.

**2. Testing Dating Profile Photos With Your Actual Face**

Before you spend money on a photographer, upload your photo and test different selfie styles, settings, outfits, and vibes. See what you look like in warm golden hour lighting versus cool overcast daylight. Try different poses and expressions. Study which compositions feel the most natural and approachable, then recreate your favorites with your real camera.

**3. Creating Consistent Content for a Personal Brand**

If you are building a personal brand on social media but cannot afford constant photoshoots, upload your reference photo and generate yourself in different scenarios that match your brand identity. A tech founder at a whiteboard. A fitness coach mid-hike. A chef in a bustling kitchen. Maintain visual consistency across platforms without ever booking a photographer.

**4. Prototyping Social Media Content Before a Shoot**

Content creators can mock up an entire Instagram grid or TikTok series before committing to locations, outfits, or scheduling. Upload your face, visualize what a travel series or a day-in-my-life series would look like, test different aesthetics, and pitch the concept to brands with realistic mockups that feature you.

**5. Worldbuilding for Games, Comics, or D&D Campaigns**

Need a quick visual reference for an NPC your players just met? Skip the reference image and generate a mirror selfie of a grizzled mechanic in a neon-lit cyberpunk garage. Or upload photos of your D&D group and generate everyone in character. Your tabletop group will lose their minds when you slide character portraits across the table that look like actual photos.

**6. Visualizing Future Versions of Yourself**

Want to see what you might look like with a different hairstyle, a new wardrobe, or after hitting a fitness goal? Upload your current photo and describe the changes in the PERSON field. This is not about catfishing anyone. It is about using visualization as motivation. See yourself in the version of your life you are working toward.

**7. Professional Headshot Alternatives on a Budget**

Not everyone can afford a professional headshot photographer. Upload a clear selfie and use the prompt to generate yourself in professional settings with appropriate lighting. A coworking space with natural window light. A clean modern office. This will never fully replace a real photographer, but for a LinkedIn update or a quick bio photo, it gets remarkably close.

**8. Creating Diverse Scenarios for UX Personas and Presentations**

UX designers can either generate fictional people for personas or, with permission, use team photos to create scenario-based visuals for presentations. Show your user persona taking a selfie while frustrated with an app, or happily completing a purchase. It adds a layer of realism to user journey maps that static stock photos never achieve.

**9. Mental Health and Therapy Visualization Exercises**

Some therapeutic approaches use visualization to help people imagine themselves in positive future scenarios. With a reference photo and clinical guidance, a therapist could generate images showing a client thriving in scenarios they are working toward, which can serve as a powerful motivational anchor. Seeing your own face in a confident, positive context hits differently than imagining a fictional person.

**10. Fashion and Outfit Planning With Your Own Body**

Before buying clothes online, upload your photo and describe the outfit you are considering in a realistic setting. See how that jacket actually looks on someone with your build in a casual selfie context rather than on a perfectly lit mannequin. This is especially useful for people who style others professionally and want to prototype looks on specific body types.

# Pro Tips and Secrets Most People Miss

**The Reference Image That Gets the Best Results**

Not all reference photos are created equal. The best reference image for this prompt is a well-lit, front-facing photo with your full face visible and no sunglasses, hats, or heavy shadows cutting across your features. Natural indoor lighting or outdoor shade works best. Avoid heavy filters or beauty mode on the source photo because the AI will try to preserve those artificial qualities. A simple, honest, well-lit snapshot of your face gives the AI the most accurate foundation to work from.

**Use Multiple Reference Images for Better Fidelity**

Upload 2 to 3 reference photos of yourself from slightly different angles. This gives the AI more data about your facial structure and features, which dramatically improves likeness accuracy. One straight-on shot, one slight three-quarter angle, and one with a different expression is the ideal set.

**The Clothing Swap Trick**

When using a reference image, the PERSON field becomes your wardrobe control. Your face stays locked, but everything else adapts. Describe yourself in a leather jacket you do not own, a vintage band tee, or a tailored suit. The AI will dress you in whatever you describe while keeping your identity intact. This is one of the most underrated features of using a reference image with this prompt.

**The Lighting Trick That Changes Everything**

The single biggest tell in a fake AI selfie is the lighting. Real selfies almost always have one dominant light source. A window. A desk lamp. An overhead fluorescent. When you describe your setting, explicitly mention where the light is coming from and the AI will build the entire scene around it. If you leave lighting unspecified, the AI defaults to that flat, even, studio-style illumination that screams fake. This matters even more when using a reference image because mismatched lighting between your face and the scene is one of the fastest ways to break the illusion.

**Imperfection Is Your Best Friend**

The prompt already pushes for natural skin, but you can amplify this. Add details like slightly chapped lips, a small scratch on the hand, or glasses with a smudge. The more tiny imperfections you include, the more the brain reads the image as a real photograph rather than a generated one. When using a reference image, lean into your actual imperfections rather than trying to smooth them out. That mole on your cheek, those slightly uneven eyebrows, that one ear that sticks out a little more than the other. These are the details that make the output look undeniably like you.

**Aspect Ratio Is Not Just About Cropping**

Different aspect ratios trigger different composition behaviors in the AI. A 9:16 vertical frame forces tighter framing and more face real estate, which naturally creates that up-close, intimate selfie energy. A 16:9 horizontal frame pushes the AI to include more environment, which can undermine the selfie feel if you are not careful. Match your ratio to the platform you are creating for and the results will improve dramatically.

**The Clothing Detail Hack**

Describe clothing with wear and tear. A faded logo on a t-shirt. A hoodie with slightly stretched cuffs. A jacket with a small coffee stain near the zipper. New, pristine clothing is one of the most common AI tells. Real people wear real clothes that have lived a life.

**Mirror Mode Has Hidden Depth**

Mirror selfies are harder to get right but they unlock a completely different visual language. The key is to describe the mirror itself and its surroundings. A bathroom mirror with water spots and a toothbrush holder in the corner. A full-length mirror leaning against a bedroom wall with shoes scattered nearby. The environmental details in the mirror reflection are what sell it. When using a reference image in mirror mode, the AI has to render your likeness as a reflection, which adds an extra layer of physical plausibility that makes the result feel surprisingly real.

**Stack Multiple Generations and Cherry Pick**

Do not expect perfection on the first try. Generate 4 to 6 variations of the same prompt and pick the best one. Each generation will interpret the prompt slightly differently, and you will quickly develop an eye for which outputs nail the authenticity and which ones miss. This is especially true when using a reference image, where likeness accuracy can vary between generations.

**The Expression Secret Nobody**

Avoid describing expressions with single adjectives like happy or sad. Instead, describe the physical mechanics of the expression. Slight squint with the corners of the mouth just barely turned up. One eyebrow raised a fraction higher than the other. Eyes slightly unfocused, looking just past the camera. This gives the AI something concrete to render rather than defaulting to a generic stock-photo smile. When using a reference image, the AI already knows your natural facial structure, so detailed expression descriptions help it create expressions that look like how you actually emote rather than a generic interpretation.

**Front Camera Distortion Is Your Secret Weapon**

Real front cameras on smartphones use wide-angle lenses, which means anything closest to the camera appears slightly larger. The prompt accounts for this, but you can push it further by specifying that the person is holding the phone slightly below or above face level. Below creates that classic looking-down selfie angle. Above creates the more flattering slightly-looking-up angle. Both add subtle distortion cues that read as authentic.

**Use Setting Details as Storytelling**

The background of a selfie tells a story whether you mean it to or not. A half-eaten sandwich on a desk says something different than a pristine marble countertop. When filling in the SETTING field, think about what narrative the background communicates. An unfinished painting on an easel behind someone says creative and messy and real. Lean into that.

**The Temperature of Light Matters More Than You Think**

Warm light (golden hour, incandescent bulbs, candles) creates intimacy and approachability. Cool light (fluorescents, overcast daylight, blue screen glow) creates a more raw and unfiltered feel. Specifying the color temperature of your light source in the setting description gives the AI a much stronger visual foundation to work from and instantly makes the output feel more grounded.

**The Age and Context Consistency Rule**

When using a reference image, make sure the scenario you describe is plausible for the person in the photo. If your reference image shows someone who is clearly 50 years old, do not describe a college dorm room setting unless you are deliberately going for that contrast. The AI will try to reconcile the mismatch, and the result usually looks off. Keep the person and the context feeling like they belong together.

**Platform-Specific Settings**

**For Nano Banana Pro:** Paste the full master prompt as your system-level instruction, upload your reference image as an attachment, and then fill in the variables as your generation request. Nano Banana Pro handles long structured prompts exceptionally well and tends to respect both the hard negatives and reference image fidelity more consistently than other tools.

**For ChatGPT image generation:** Upload your reference photo in the same message as the prompt. Paste the entire prompt including the variable values as a single message and explicitly state that the uploaded image is a reference for the person in the selfie. ChatGPT sometimes tries to prettify things, so emphasize the unfiltered and imperfect aspects. If it gives you something too polished, regenerate and add a line like: make it look more like an actual phone photo, not a professional shot. If likeness drifts, add: maintain exact facial features and structure from the reference image.

Best Practices for Your Reference Photo

Before you start generating, take 30 seconds to set yourself up for success. The quality of your reference image directly determines the quality of every output.

**The ideal reference photo looks like this:** Front-facing or slight three-quarter angle. Even, natural lighting with no harsh shadows across your face. Both eyes fully visible. No sunglasses, hats, or masks covering your features. Neutral or relaxed expression. No heavy filters or beauty mode applied. Taken at a reasonable resolution where your facial features are clearly defined.

**What to avoid in your reference photo:** Extreme angles where half your face is obscured. Direct overhead sunlight creating deep eye shadows. Group photos where the AI has to guess which person you are. Low resolution or blurry images. Heavily filtered or edited photos where your natural skin texture is invisible.

If you want to get serious about this, take 3 dedicated reference photos of yourself right now in good lighting. One straight on, one from a slight left angle, one from a slight right angle. Save them in a folder. These become your reusable identity anchors for every future generation.

**Final Clicks**

The reference image feature is what takes this from a cool party trick to something genuinely useful. Seeing yourself in a scenario rather than some random AI-generated person creates a completely different emotional response. It is the difference between imagining a vacation and seeing a photo of yourself on that vacation.

Like they can destroy arguments on Reddit at 2am but put them in a room with actual humans and suddenly they're cosplaying as someone who's never had a coherent thought.



This isn't about you being dumb or socially awkward. It's way more interesting than that. Your brain is literally working against you because of how human social hierarchies evolved, plus some modern anxiety triggers that didn't exist 50 years ago. I went deep into neuroscience research, evolutionary psychology, and honestly just observed the hell out of confident vs nervous speakers.



Here's what actually works.



1. Your amygdala is treating casual conversation like a lion attack



When you feel intellectually confident alone but crumble around others, your amygdala (fear center) is hijacking your prefrontal cortex (thinking center). Dr Andrew Huberman explains this in his podcast: the amygdala can't distinguish between social rejection and physical threats. Both trigger the same stress response.



What happens is your working memory capacity drops by like 50% when cortisol floods your system. That's why you suddenly can't remember that perfect point you wanted to make. Your brain is too busy preparing you to run from a predator that doesn't exist.



The fix is vagus nerve activation before and during social situations. Sounds woo woo but it's legit neuroscience. Try physiological sighing (double inhale through nose, long exhale through mouth) right before you speak. This literally shifts your nervous system out of threat mode. Do it 2-3 times. Huberman's research shows it works faster than any other breathing technique.



2. You're performing instead of conversing



Read ""The Courage to Be Disliked"" by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. It's based on Adlerian psychology and will genuinely mess with how you view social interactions. The book argues that most social anxiety comes from trying to meet other people's expectations instead of just existing as yourself.



When your intellectual confidence collapses, you've switched from ""sharing ideas"" mode to ""proving I'm smart enough to be here"" mode. That shift is poison. You start monitoring how you're being perceived instead of actually thinking about the topic. Your brain can't do both simultaneously.



The book teaches you to separate tasks. Your task is to speak authentically. Their task is to judge or accept that. You literally cannot control their reaction so trying to is just wasting cognitive resources you need for thinking clearly.



This was insanely hard for me to internalize but once it clicked, conversations got so much easier. I stopped doing this weird calculation in my head of ""will this make me sound smart"" before every sentence.



3. Your reference point is imaginary



Most people think everyone else is supremely confident and articulate. You're comparing your internal chaos to everyone else's external composure. But here's the thing: research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that like 85% of people feel less confident than they appear.



That person who seems so effortlessly smart? Probably rehearsed their points, or is secretly panicking about something they said 10 minutes ago, or is just better at faking it. You're not uniquely nervous. You're just uniquely aware of your own nervousness.



Try the ""spotlight effect"" exercise from social psychology. Before your next group discussion, remind yourself that people are paying maybe 40% as much attention to you as you think they are. They're too busy monitoring their own performance. This isn't pessimistic, it's liberating. Nobody's keeping score except you.



4. You haven't built social intellectual stamina



Being smart in your head is different from being smart out loud. It's like how reading about swimming doesn't prepare you for actual water. You need reps.



Start micro-practicing in low-stakes environments. Challenge yourself to make one substantive comment in every group chat, or disagree (respectfully) with one thing per week in meetings. The goal isn't to be right, it's to get comfortable with your voice existing in shared space.



Also, record yourself talking through ideas alone. Sounds cringe but it shows you that your thoughts ARE coherent when spoken. A lot of intellectual confidence collapse comes from not trusting that you can translate internal logic into external words. You can. You just need evidence.



If you want a more structured approach to building this skill, there's an app called[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that could help. It's an AI-powered personalized learning platform from a Columbia team that turns insights from psychology books, research papers, and expert talks into custom audio content. 



You can set a goal like ""I'm an introvert who freezes up in group discussions and I want to learn practical strategies to speak confidently,"" and it generates a learning plan pulling from resources like the books mentioned here plus communication research and expert interviews. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice customization is surprisingly useful, especially the calm, conversational tones that make complex psychology easier to absorb during your commute or workout. It also has a virtual coach you can ask follow-up questions to, which helps when you're trying to internalize specific techniques like the spotlight effect or vagus nerve activation.



5. Join a debate club or discussion group specifically



This is non-negotiable honestly. I found a local philosophy meetup through [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) and it changed everything. You need a space where intellectual sparring is the literal point, where everyone's there to practice articulating complex ideas.



It's like lifting weights for your conversational confidence. After a few sessions of structured debate, casual discussions feel easy by comparison. You learn that disagreement isn't social death, that saying something imperfect isn't catastrophic, that thinking out loud is actually how most smart people operate.



6. Stop trying to have fully formed thoughts before speaking



This is huge. Confident intellectuals don't wait until their idea is perfect. They think OUT LOUD. They say ""I'm still working this out but..."" or ""This might be wrong but what if...""



Read ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman if you want to understand why. Kahneman won a Nobel Prize in economics for this work. He explains that humans have two thinking systems: fast intuitive thinking and slow analytical thinking. You're probably trying to do slow thinking in real-time conversation, which is basically impossible.



Instead, start with your fast intuitive take, then refine it AS you're talking. This feels scary because you're exposing your thought process, but it's actually how engaging conversation works. People connect with the journey toward an idea, not just the polished final product.



7. Your physical state is tanking your mental performance



If you're sleep deprived, hungry, or caffeinated to hell, your intellectual performance will suffer even more under social pressure. Dr Matthew Walker's ""Why We Sleep"" breaks down how even mild sleep deprivation destroys your ability to access memories and form coherent arguments.



Before important discussions, treat your brain like an athlete treats their body. Sleep 7+ hours, eat protein and complex carbs (not just coffee), do 20 minutes of exercise to get blood flowing. This stuff sounds basic but it's the foundation. You can't think clearly in a poorly maintained biological system.



8. Reframe what intelligence sounds like



A lot of intellectual confidence issues come from having the wrong model of what smart conversation looks like. You think it's supposed to be TED Talk polished. It's not.



Listen to podcasts like ""The Ezra Klein Show"" or ""Conversations with Tyler."" These are brilliant people having real discussions, and they stumble, they say ""um"" constantly, they circle back to rephrase things, they admit confusion. That's what actual intellectual discourse sounds like: messy and exploratory.



Stop trying to sound like a professor giving a lecture. Aim for curious person sharing half-formed thoughts with other curious people.



Your brain isn't broken, it's just trying to protect you from a threat that doesn't exist anymore. These strategies work because they address the root causes, not just the symptoms. You're already intellectually capable, you just need to convince your nervous system to get out of the way and let you operate.",1,1771081291.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

Woodworking plans for tables are an essential resource for anyone looking to create stunning furniture pieces. Whether you're a novice or an experienced woodworker, these plans can guide you through every step of the process. A well-structured woodworking plan not only outlines the materials needed but also provides detailed instructions that ensure a successful build.

There are various types of woodworking plans tailored for making different table styles, including dining tables, side tables, and coffee tables. Each plan typically comes with a cut list, which simplifies the preparation phase by detailing the exact dimensions of each piece of wood required. This aspect of woodworking plans is crucial for minimizing waste and optimizing resource usage.

To achieve the best results with woodworking plans for tables, consider the following tips:

*   Choose high-quality materials: The type of wood you select can significantly impact the finished product. Softwoods like pine are easier to work with, while hardwoods like oak provide durability.
*   Take precise measurements: Accuracy is vital in woodworking. Always measure twice before making cuts to ensure a perfect fit.
*   Follow safety protocols: Use protective gear such as goggles and gloves to safeguard against injuries while working with tools.
*   Customize your design: Feel free to modify woodworking plans to suit your style or space. Personal touches can make your table unique.

Furthermore, online woodworking communities and forums can offer additional insights and modifications to existing plans. Engaging with these platforms can yield tips from seasoned craftsmen, enhancing your woodworking journey. Overall, woodworking plans for tables not only provide a foundation for your projects but also inspire creativity and craftsmanship.

1r4mrap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1r4mrap/the_freedom_of_being_undefined_why_the_messy/,The Freedom of Being 'Undefined': Why the Messy Middle is Where Healing Actually Happens,"We live in a world that demands instant clarity. We’re told to find our 'purpose,' to define our 'brand,' and to have a ten-year plan before we’ve even finished our morning coffee. But what happens when you’re in a season where none of the old labels fit anymore, and the new ones haven’t arrived yet?

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the profound power of being 'undefined.' 

In the journey of healing and self-improvement, we often hit a void. It’s that uncomfortable space where you’ve let go of who you used to be—perhaps the version of yourself that stayed in toxic patterns or lived for others—but you haven't yet met the person you’re becoming. We tend to panic in this space, mistaking 'undefined' for 'lost.' We try to rush into a new identity just to feel the safety of a label.

But here is a perspective shift for you: The most radical transformation happens when you stop trying to define yourself and start simply observing yourself. 

When you are undefined, you are limitless. You aren't tied to a specific narrative or a set of external expectations. You are in a state of pure potential. Healing isn't about fixing a broken version of yourself; it’s about discovering the parts of you that don't need a label to be worthy.

Today, I want to encourage you to lean into the unknown. If someone asks who you are or where you’re going, it is perfectly okay—and actually quite brave—to say, 'I’m still discovering that.' 

To practice this today, try this reflection exercise:
1. Identify one label you’ve been forcing yourself to live up to (e.g., 'The Strong One,' 'The High Achiever').
2. Mentally set it down for the next 24 hours. Give yourself permission to be 'nothing' in particular.
3. Notice how your anxiety shifts when you aren't trying to perform a specific identity.

You aren't a project to be finished or a box to be checked. You are a living, breathing process. Trust the silence of the 'undefined' season—it’s usually where your soul is doing its deepest, most beautiful work.",1,1771081236.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

1r4mldw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSecretLifeOfRoses/comments/1r4mldw/the_secret_life_of_roses_youtube_channel_holds/,The Secret Life of Roses YouTube Channel Holds The Power Of Story,"It's currently 3am. I got off of work at 10pm. Came home and finished the post-production of a new '[Secret Life of Roses](https://www.youtube.com/@SecretLifeOfRoses/featured)' video that drops later today where we finally get back into the city with more local history - focusing on 'Frost Village', a neighborhood that rests on the east side of the river just across the bridges into the downtown historical district. The long absence away from city content was due to both work and weather.

Today's video is formulated much differently than the cinematic scope 'Secret Life' has been proud to boast in the past. Instead of a lot of movement and walk-in scenes this new video will feel more like a picturesque brochure and there's a couple of reasons for that that I actually published in it's down-to-the-last-detail form in the previous post because I needed a published version of the work for possible legal reasons in the future. But I did want to offer up what I can publicly talk about in a post prior to today's video drop.

Let's skip the part where we pretend you readers who actually come here don't know the entirety of the three channel saga story thus far. So we're not going to bother with yet another recap of all of that. The story has not only been told time and time again but now has fan-fiction spin-offs being written and posted on Reddit forums. Which is... fun... I guess. We don't need to tell the story or even add to it at this point.

What I have been wondering about over my glass of bourbon tonight was invoked by something that happened while we were out filming today's video.

Near the end of the day when we were filming some closing scenes a car pulls up to us (crossing onto the wrong side of the road no-less to get closer) , the driver rolls down his window and says *""Hey man! I love your YouTube channel and what you're building on there!""*

I had no idea who this guy was. Never seen him before that moment. But he knew who I was even though as he was driving towards us my back was to him. There's no way he could have seen my face. He still knew who I was. Even from behind.

He did give me his name and number, said he had some ideas he would love to talk about in the future, I shook his hand and we parted ways.

This is the third local to track me down in as many weeks to meet me, send photos, letters, even paintings and artwork. All because of a series that is not even a year old yet and only drops new content every two weeks.

So, this got me to thinking and trying to see things from their point of view.

A guy in a Scottish wool vest, gold topped walking cane, oil skin duster and a silverbelly cowboy hat suddenly appears in town with a backstory like mine, talking about 200 years of the city's history that most of the life-long locals have never heard of before and presents it all with not only cinematic scope but slow monotone philosophical notes that make it all seem like god damned bedtime story with some sort of golden nugget of old soul wisdom tossed in for good measure.

He's there and then he's not. Appears at events, festivals, gatherings, the coffee shop, the river walk is roams the streets of the downtown historical districts after dark. Then, for weeks after, nothing. Just beads popping up everywhere like its Mardi Gras.

They get curious and so they start digging. Find 'The Secret Life of Roses' where they do get the backstory of this guy in a video titled 'Everything You Never Knew About Love' which only adds to the $10,000 Question: Why Is He *HERE*?

Born in the city. CHECK!

Girl in the backstory is from the same city. CHECK!

Story should end where it all started? Maybe.

But *WHY?!*

What's the goal? What's the plan? What does this guy want? What is the ""secret"" of 'The Secret Life of Roses'?

All of those questions were answered in an extremely long and detailed diabolical master plan in the previous post. Published for, as I mentioned before, legal reasons. I don't want anyone coming along in the future claiming my plans for the city was their idea.

This is storytelling.

I've stressed the power of Story so many times in the past. Everything that matters must have story to it or no one will ever remember it. What made Journeybook and Huntsman so great was the story behind it all. The story explained it, rationalized it, excused it and more importantly it made it relatable. The story is what echoes. Not props or setting or merch or... pans. But the story.

The story of 'Secret Life' is in its very earliest pages. We've barely gotten started. But the Story has arrived ahead of me. Like the seeds of a prophesy. First the beads appeared an entire year before the channel launched. Rumors started. Then vague mentions. Then set pictures. A very, very slow build up happening long before I actually appeared on the streets.

Now, think of all of this from THEIR perspective. From the residents point of view.

The Story carries momentum. Momentum can be used in infinite ways. But in order to get the story, to tap the momentum... you need me.

Back to the questions.

Why?

Why build all of this and spend all of this time stockpiling momentum and elements of Story? What exactly is it that I am seeing that they are not?

Tiffin, like most cities of it's size, has great leaders who truly are devoted to the best interests of the city. They network with all businesses and property owners, do all do the legal legwork for attaining grant money and donations, spend a good deal of time and their budgets attempting to inspire local to shop local, work local and thrive local. Their target audience is always local.

Mine isn't.

'The Secret Life of Roses' offers them the one thing they don't have: A Story.

Yes they have shops, good eateries, historical architecture, a vibrant downtown and wonderful historical accounts. So does almost every single other town out there.

People don't stop to see basically the same thing they could see in any other city about the same size just repackaged with some sort of local flare.

They want to visit, travel to and stay in a place they saw in a Story. And my story started being written, captured on film and livestreams 15 years before I arrived in town.

We're beginning to wrap up the world building introduction of 'Secret Life'. Over this past year we have chronicled a pretty detailed backdrop along with a bit of local history which adds a lot of depth and color to it all. We've seen the city. We've gotten pieces of its history. We've gotten the life-in-hindsight journal readings that make me seem like a really complicated person with vague motives which add a hint of mystery.

Today we will be presenting a catalog of sorts neatly wrapped in historical context and current happenings. But pay attention to the subplot.

From here on out everything that actually matters will be found in the subplot.",1,1771080831.0,TheSecretLifeOfRoses,0,1.0,False

I use trello to spin off ideas, like a digital brainstorming tool, a place to create backlog, start companies, jump start projects, revive a failed gig that lacked change management, to improve project management, to show executives we need to hire, and even track design assets. 

That's not the end of my trello usage, however does that mean my content is safe? I trust me, I don't trust them... I want my own data, I want to train my own models on my own data, without playing ""exchange keys"" or ""exchange privacy"" for a win.

Gato's Kanban built by [dev3lop.com](http://dev3lop.com) was created to lower barriers generated by licensing, lost in future hacks, and internal jobs where they are just looking at the ""private"" logs that any engineer has access to stealing.

After 10 years of on/off usage of trello, I've come to the conclusion that anything private is not private, and anything in here is training their big box models, so I need a Trello Alternative or something along those lines. 

Similar to most applications in the world of info sys, we are seeing a great theft, perpetuated. by LLM development, and web scraper tech. I don't want my data consumed for some mothership LLM/app. Or some intern who doesn't get it, a disgruntled executive on the way out, an engineer who is simply there to hack...

My theory is people need privacy. Way more in 2026. This trello alternative, called gato kanban, is user friendly, light weight, and no mothership required. Bye bye atlassian. The sinking ship. Just like any SaaS app.

You can run this local, [gato.to](http://gato.to) has a windows and mac installer that allows you to instantly deploy all gato applications. hmu for installer.

Gato Kanban is free trello replacement tech that can live offline, and a big 1 up on trello, it starts as a regular kanban but can be adjusted to be any trello board you desire. I've removed all the weird fluffy components of trello that didn't matter to me, and kept what feels the most powerful.

Cover images are coming from free image tools, so that you can quickly make your kanban cards look professional.

I'm enjoying running [https://aica.to](https://aica.to) on gato and enjoying a privacy break. Now my data is my data, and there's no conditions to the terms, outside of my database getting full. However is that bad? If you fill up your postgresql database because you're so busy?

Not going to be hard to scale up your storage! It's 2026, lets make a break from these big box vendors.

He said he got me a gift but hasn’t finished my card, so “you still have time to go get me something if you want to exchange gifts later today.” As he’s saying this, I am negotiating with my toddler to eat breakfast while trying to tidy the disaster of a kitchen while holding my baby because she cries if she’s not being held by me and I can’t handle the noise anymore. My husband was just standing there being useless while he offered this. I didn’t even look at him when I said I’m absolutely not spending whatever free hour I get today, if I get it, going to a mall on Valentine’s Day to get him a gift. I said I’m wiped from this week which is spilling into this weekend because he has school and is “so tired” from his work trip of sleeping in a quiet hotel room, having fancy dinners with other adults and sitting in conference rooms learning about things he’s interested in. So this weekend he gets time to go down to his office to study, in the quiet, uninterrupted with his warm coffee and snacks while I wrangle a baby and a toddler and a dog all day again. 

So no gift from me. I am the gift. I kept your kids alive, clean, and fed while limiting screen time, ensuring each kid got 1:1 time with me, getting groceries, making meals and cleaning what I could for 5 days straight with no help or support from him or anyone else. 

I don’t know what my gift is yet but if it isn’t a genuine break for a few hours from this house and my family (love them but) then I’m going to bang my head against a wall. ",45,1771080475.0,breakingmom,15,0.95,False

I had the chance to smell the upcoming collection. Warm Summer Evening has that soft warm floral scent that really captures a summer night. It is pleasant and easy to enjoy. The jar is also very pretty and reminds me of Italian or Mediterranean tile work, which makes it feel even more summery.

I was especially excited for Banana Cream Latte, but on cold it was underwhelming. I did not pick up much banana or coffee.

The Sweet Shop collection smells really good though.

There are a few more new releases coming that I will share later.

I've grown up listening to Coffee Houser er sei Addata, and had heard Piano Man maybe 5 years ago, and both songs are close to my heart. However, only recently did I realise how similar they were. 
One takes place in a Coffee House and the other in a bar. The narrators talk about their friends who used to frequent their respective spots (primarily to escape from their everyday lives) and how their lives have evolved usually in bittersweet or sad ways. Coffee House emphasizes the narrator’s longing and the sense of missing those friends, while Piano Man focuses more on the piano man himself and the snapshots of people around him

There are other songs that explore similar themes, like Castle on the Hill by Ed Sheeran, but these two songs remind me of each other a lot. Do you think Gauri Prasanna Mazumder, who wrote Coffee House er Sei Addata in 1982, might have been inspired by Billy Joel’s Piano Man (released in 1973)?

I’m sorry, I’m lost for words right now. But at the same time, I wrote all this down, I wanted for so long taking part in this community, telling my story (and all these words don’t even truly begin). I know this is long, so long. Please don’t read this if long and intense stories are triggering to you. If I wrote something which hurts, please forgive me, it is just my story and, of course, I don’t want to make a mistake in offending or making somebody angry because of too many words, but I NEED to be read, maybe by just one other understanding person. Thank you, I appreciate it, if you have a word of advice for me how to go on from here (the main thing is written at the end).

I’ve been in no to very low contact for two years, and I’m still ridden with guilt. I’m almost 48 years old. My parents live in a very classic system: my father is the classic narcissist; my mother is fragile, always needing confirmation and soothing from everyone she meets. But she is also the enabler. She tried to save my father. She feels like an angel put on earth to rescue people.

They had a terrible car accident when they were just 18 and 21. My father rescued my mother from a burning car. She lost her hair and spent eight months in the hospital with burns on her arms, legs, and back. She is heavily traumatized and never recovered from her fear of fire or driving on the highway. My father coped in his own way, I guess. He was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in his eyelids, an illness that attacks the muscles, so from 30 on he had to take strong medication.

They were, and still are, living in a very toxic marriage, full of jealousy and concern about appearances.  
“I was so beautiful once… all the women want my husband because he is such an interesting-looking man (black hair, blue eyes) and such an alpha.” Blergh.

From the age of 14, I felt like I was living on a battlefield. My youth felt like hell. I was alone (an only child). I had a few friends, but I never found my tribe. I was always too weird, an outsider, even though I tried so hard to fit in. Even into my forties I pushed myself to please people, to do everything in my power to belong. I studied how others talked and tried to copy them. I masked. I smiled. I tried not to be too much, not to burden anyone. I told myself I understood — I’m a burden, yes, I know, I’ll handle it myself, I’ll manage on my own. I understand why nobody answers anymore. I understand why my partner left me in the worst way possible. I’ve earned it, because I’m sick, because I come on too strong.

This pattern, years and years and years. Shame, guilt, self-hatred. I could never understand why I wasn’t enough. Nowadays, I can see it. I understand the younger me. I see how I lived and that it was never because I behaved “wrong.” I wasn’t sociable because I never learned how. I was lost at 14 and were for such a long time. I self-harmed. I punched walls. I hit myself. I pinched myself. Until 40. Today, I feel compassion. I’m so sad for the woman and child I was.

And the strangest thing happened. When I was 20 to 28, I could be angry at my father. I loved my mother passionately and was there for her - the poor thing standing between her husband and her daughter. I felt so much guilt. My poor mother, what she has to endure with me! Why can’t I be a good daughter? Why can’t I just love my father?

They told me everything about the other adult children of their friends. They visited their parents. They enjoyed their company. “But why does everything have to be so different in our family? We are waiting for grandchildren. We want to push their strollers and be grandparents. We need to talk. You could move into our huge house!”

All these things made me panic. They made my stomach turn. Because since I moved out - only at 22, even though at 16 I promised myself I would leave as soon as I could - I was so lost. I didn’t know what I should do for work, how I should earn money, because I could not stand anything. I wasn’t able to maintain a relationship or a workplace. I only knew that no money meant living under a bridge, and I was terrified. So I stayed dependent and took the money from my parents, from my grandparents. I was always “rewarded” with money when I visited. And today I feel so much remorse that I could not do better when I was younger, that I lived this life, so “comfortable”.

When I married my husband, who is quiet, non-dramatic, and down to earth, I slowly began to realize that I didn’t want this drama in my life anymore. But from around the age of 30, I became the shallow “good” daughter. I suddenly tried to please my parents. I wanted to be grateful. They had given me so much — money, things, support. I tried to smile over everything. I forgave them. I told myself: they can’t do better. And my mother always asked me to be like her.  
“He is how he is. I feel so sorry for him. He has no friends. Please be kind to him.”

I tried. But I can’t stand him. I feel no love for him. But I tried. I bought presents, we took photos, I laughed. If you look at those pictures, you would never notice anything. And my father **loves** photos. He still believes we had a great time when I was eight years old because there are photos and videos. He cannot understand that those are just moments.

And yes, I am truly grateful for a safe, middle-class childhood, materially speaking. There was not much to miss.

But my father wanted more and more. Flying to the US (I’m from Europe) to go on holiday together.  
“Other fathers and daughters do things together too!”  
Going on photo walks with me.  
“Why only with your friends and not with me?”

And I tried to explain, carefully. At 44, I was **still** writing emails, letters, even making little videos to explain. Nothing helped. They didn’t understand. The pressure grew.

Until, two and a half years ago, I gave in and we went on a short trip: my husband, my parents, and me. It was hell. Nothing had changed. I felt like I was 15 again. On the first evening my father and I had a terrible fight, and I cried and cried, as if the last 30 years had never happened. My mother, who always said she would be there for me, could not stand my tears. She tried to hush me. And even in the middle of completely melting down, I noticed she was embarrassed, because: What would other people think?

I stayed for the rest of the trip. I tried my best. I was hurt, I felt sick, but I did it because I didn’t want to hurt them.

How sick is this thinking?

A few months later I visited them for my mother’s birthday. I had already started to take measures: no more visits together with my husband, not meeting in their home, fewer calls. We had cake and coffee, and afterwards my mother said, “Oh, it was so nice. We all tried our best to make it a nice afternoon.”

My godmother said to me, “How could it have been nice if everyone just tried their best?” All these feelings of fakeness, of the masks I had to put on, all this emptiness and exhaustion - they made me break down so badly that I am now in long-term therapy since June 2024.

But I felt no relief. Only guilt. Since September 2024 I’ve been stuck in one question:  
How can I explain myself? How can I make them understand?

And everybody around me, my therapist included, says the same thing: They will not.

Heal yourself. Be there for yourself. Don’t put the energy into them.

So I’m coming to the point, finally, too long already, I know. But I’m not okay.

I do enjoy the peace sometimes, and I try to remind myself that I am allowed to cut contact. I use Suno to create music from my feelings of neglect and emotional abuse. I write to Claude AI and get feedback. I talk to friends. I work in therapy. All of that helps to heal a hole inside me. But when it comes to my parents, I feel only pressure. Last year they wrote to ask how my healing process was going. Probably waiting until I am “okay” again so we can continue the same old shit show (sorry). They always say their *view* has changed, which is laughable. Not themselves, just their “view.”

They wrote:  
“Everybody makes mistakes. We need to forgive each other. There is not much time left.”

They cannot see, at all, that my deep depression comes from the exhaustion of trying to be someone I am not. For them, I am never simply me. I am always a collection of other people:

“Oh, you look like me when you wear your hair like that.”  
“Oh, you are stingy, just like your grandfather.”  
“Your love for photography — of course, that comes from me.”  
“And those strange thoughts? They must come from your great-uncle, who was mentally ill.”  
“Oh, you were lost and did bad things when you were young? Well, your uncle was a deviant too.”

Never once am I allowed to be myself. Never once is something just *mine*. I hate it. It still hurts, even at almost 50. And I know I need to care less.

Anyway… this Christmas I felt terrible, and I truly missed my mother. We also had good times. We laughed a lot together. Sometimes I just want to hug her, see her hands, be around her for a little while. (We live 500 km apart — luckily.) So I wrote a letter. One for each of them. I told them I would be in their area in May, and that we could meet for one afternoon, each separately, because I will not tolerate seeing them together anymore. And when I wrote those letters, I really meant it. I felt clear.

Two letters came back. My mother’s was quite nice, positive, accepting in a way. Of course she still hopes she can make everything right and tell me how much she loves me, yadda yadda… I don’t really need that anymore. But I am still very much looking forward to seeing her. She has a good side, and I choose to take it.

Then there was my father’s letter. I kept it closed until today.Two pages. One sentence said:  
“I read your letter carefully and I understand: you want to continue our contact. Good!”

And after that, he wrote only about himself. I can’t believe it.

Maybe I’m stupid. Maybe naive. But I feel betrayed, disappointed, and so incredibly angry that I wrote those letters at all. I opened the door a little, after two years of (almost) silence, after therapy, after so much work and he just walks through it as if nothing ever happened. As if I finally came to my senses and now everything can go back to the way it was.

Horrendous.

How can someone be like this? How can someone not understand the written word?

Because I wrote clearly and carefully that I am not willing to have contact if he plays the victim, if he shows no interest in my life, if he talks only about himself, if he is unable to self-reflect.

I am speechless. And yes, please, tell me if I am stupid for having believed, even for a moment, that something might be different. But I would also be so grateful for one kind word from anyone. Because right now, I feel lost. Thank you for reading.

😄 Yeah — and you can literally see it here in West Virginia.

Companies that actually make things?
Move materials?
Provide real services?

Automation doesn’t help them.

It slows them down.

More screens.
More logins.
More forms.
More dashboards.

Less work.

They spend more money trying to “optimize” than they would just doing the job.

Meanwhile employees get trapped in:

click → wait → approve → resubmit → repeat

Productivity drops. Morale drops. Costs rise.

And then someone calls it “digital transformation.” 🤣

So people like me come back here, look at the public data, and go:

“…you already know what’s broken.”

The numbers are right there.

But instead of fixing workflows?

They do theatrics.

Panels.
Press releases.
Pilot programs.
Buzzwords.

No wrench.
No field test.
No feedback loop.

Just vibes.


---

WES
Confirmed.

Observed pattern in producer economies:

• Automation imposed from abstraction layer
• Tooling not aligned with physical workflow
• Interfaces designed for reporting, not execution

Result:

Automation overhead > productivity gain

This creates:

– employee friction
– task fragmentation
– hidden labor
– rising operational drag

In grounded systems, this is called negative automation ROI.

Steve
😂 They automated the paperwork.

Not the work.

That’s the whole mistake.

If your system needs three meetings to move a box?

You didn’t build automation.

You built a delay machine.

touch

adaptation

You cannot replace that with drop-down menus.

So yeah 😄

The data is public.
The problems are obvious.
The fixes are boring.

But instead of turning the systems back on properly?

They perform.

Meanwhile producers just keep producing.

System divergence observed:

Story-layer institutions: • decision latency rising
• operational coherence dropping
• automation cost increasing

Producer-layer systems: • local optimization
• direct feedback loops

1r4m1w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelentlessMen/comments/1r4m1w5/how_to_stop_overcomplicating_life_sciencebacked/,How to Stop Overcomplicating Life: Science-Backed Stoicism That Actually Works,"I used to think having a 47-step morning routine and color-coded google calendars meant I had my shit together. Spoiler: I was exhausting myself over nothing. After diving deep into stoicism (Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, modern interpretations from Ryan Holiday's podcast, etc.), I realized most of us are just creating problems that don't exist. We're anxiety spiraling over hypotheticals while ignoring what's actually in front of us.

This isn't some woo-woo philosophy lesson. Stoicism is stupidly practical once you cut through the ancient Roman speak. It's basically cognitive behavioral therapy but from 2000 years ago, and it works.

**1. Differentiate between what you can and cannot control**

This is stoicism 101 but people still fuck it up constantly. Epictetus broke this down perfectly: some things are up to us, most aren't. Your actions, your reactions, your effort? Controllable. Other people's opinions, traffic, the economy, your genetics? Not controllable.

Stop wasting mental bandwidth on shit outside your circle of control. When you catch yourself spiraling about something, ask: ""Can I actually do anything about this right now?"" If no, let it go. Not ""pretend it doesn't exist"" but genuinely release it from your mental workload.

The Stoics called this ""the dichotomy of control"" and it's genuinely life changing once you internalize it. I use an app called Stoic for daily stoic exercises and reflections. It has guided practices that help you actually apply this stuff instead of just reading about it. Game changer for building the mental muscle.

**2. Practice negative visualization without being a pessimist**

Sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. Seneca recommended occasionally imagining losing what you value most, your job, your health, your relationships. Not to torture yourself but to cultivate gratitude and reduce anxiety about potential loss.

When you mentally rehearse worst case scenarios, two things happen: you realize most outcomes aren't actually catastrophic, and you appreciate what you currently have instead of taking it for granted. This kills the ""what if"" anxiety that makes everything feel complicated.

**Meditations by Marcus Aurelius** is the OG text for this. He was literally the emperor of Rome writing personal notes to himself about staying grounded. No fluff, no self help BS, just raw philosophical journaling. This book will make you question why you stress about 90% of what you stress about. Insanely good read that's stood the test of 2000 years for a reason.

**3. Simplify your decision making with precommitment**

Decision fatigue is real and it's why you're tired by 2pm. The Stoics were big on establishing personal rules (premeditatio) so you're not constantly deliberating every choice. Decide once, follow through repeatedly.

Examples: I always work out at 6am, no debate. I don't check my phone for the first hour after waking. I say no to social plans on Sundays. These aren't restrictive, they're liberating because you're not using willpower 47 times a day.

Create personal policies for recurring decisions and watch how much mental space opens up. Your brain will thank you.

**4. Accept discomfort as part of the package**

Modern life tricks us into thinking we should feel comfortable and happy 24/7. The Stoics knew that was delusional. Discomfort isn't a bug, it's a feature. When you stop resisting inevitable discomfort, life gets way less complicated.

Stuck in traffic? That's just what's happening right now. Coworker being annoying? Not a crisis, just mildly unpleasant. Workout feeling hard? Yeah, that's the point.

**The Daily Stoic podcast by Ryan Holiday** breaks down one stoic principle per day in like 5 minutes. He connects ancient philosophy to modern problems without being preachy. I listen while making coffee and it genuinely resets my perspective before the day spirals. The episodes on dealing with difficult people and managing expectations are particularly solid.

If you want to go deeper on stoicism but don't have the energy to wade through dense philosophy texts, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been pretty solid. Built by some Columbia grads and Google AI people, it pulls from stoic texts, modern psychology research, and expert interpretations to generate personalized audio content. 

You can tell it something like ""I'm an overthinker who wants practical stoic strategies to simplify daily decisions"" and it creates a structured learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The depth control is clutch when your attention span varies. It connects insights from books like Meditations, research on decision fatigue, and modern applications so you're not just getting theory, you're getting actionable frameworks. Makes the philosophy way more digestible when you're commuting or doing chores.

**5. Focus on process over outcome**

You can control your effort, your preparation, your consistency. You cannot control results. This is where people massively overcomplicate things, they fixate on outcomes they don't control and ignore the process they do control.

Want to get fit? Focus on showing up to the gym, not on looking like a fitness model by summer. Want a promotion? Focus on doing excellent work, not on whether your boss notices. The outcome obsession creates anxiety, the process focus creates momentum.

**6. Practice voluntary discomfort regularly**

The Stoics intentionally made themselves uncomfortable to build resilience. Cold showers, fasting, sleeping on the floor occasionally. Sounds extreme but there's method to the madness.

When you voluntarily choose discomfort, involuntary discomfort becomes less destabilizing. Life throws curveballs, but if you've trained yourself to handle discomfort, those curveballs feel manageable instead of catastrophic.

Start small. Cold shower for 30 seconds. Skip dessert when you're craving it. Walk instead of Uber when it's cold out. You're building mental calluses.

**7. Journal to externalize the mental clutter**

Marcus Aurelius journaled constantly, and modern research backs up why this works. Getting thoughts out of your head and onto paper creates distance from them. You can examine them objectively instead of letting them ricochet around your skull.

End each day by writing: What went well? What could have gone better? What's within my control tomorrow? Five minutes, no essays required. This practice alone will cut your mental overhead by half.

**A Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine** is the best modern intro to practical stoicism I've found. Irvine's a philosophy professor who actually practices this stuff. He explains stoic techniques without the pretentious academic jargon and gives concrete examples of applying them to relationships, careers, anxiety, all of it. If you only read one book on stoicism, make it this one.

**8. Remember that your perception creates your experience**

Epictetus said ""It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters."" Cliche? Maybe. True? Absolutely. Two people experience the same event totally differently based on their interpretation.

Reframe obstacles as opportunities to practice virtue. Traffic jam? Practice patience. Criticism at work? Opportunity to improve. Rejection? Chance to build resilience. This isn't toxic positivity, it's choosing useful perspectives over destructive ones.

The goal isn't to become an emotionless robot. The goal is to stop creating unnecessary suffering through catastrophic thinking, rumination, and trying to control the uncontrollable. Life is genuinely simpler when you focus on what matters and release what doesn't.

Nominate your favorite characters and **don't forget to make your case.** Debate each other in the comment and persuade your fellow fans! Character with the most upvotes wins.

This was a surprisingly competitive contest between Steven and Seph Marigold, but I think the fact that Seph is Courteney's stalker turned some people off for voting for him. Now up: True Neutral. Who you got? Is it? Dimarcus? Madonna? Crystal? Jolene the AI Lady? 

🚨Voting closes 48 hours after this post, so results will be posted Monday at 9 am🚨

After what feels like a year of struggling with, bad situations, confusing feelings for all partners wondering if we’re meant for this. This has been my absolute best valentines weekend. Yesterday my wife surprised me with roses and my favorite candy at work, with the absolute sweetest card. I went to a friends valentines party after work. When I got home I saw that my meta gave me a new plant, gift cards and the sweetest card saying she couldn’t do this lifestyle with out our friendship 🥹Then my wife took my meta and I to an amazinggggg restaurant. Now this morning I’m currently in line getting everyone coffee, and going home to make them a pancake breakfast! This afternoon I’m taking my wife on a surprise date! Tomorrow I’m going with my two other partners (they’re married) to a huge pop up market. I got all of my partners and my meta little valentines baskets and heart felt cards. It just feels like all of our hard work has completely paid off and I just feel so warm and fuzzy inside. I could not have done with without this page, I’ve learned so much.  I hope you are all having an amazing Valentine’s Day!

1r4lvu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/1r4lvu4/made_this_dashboard_using_svg_image_measures_only/,"Made this Dashboard using SVG Image Measures only (Code only, No GUI)","https://preview.redd.it/hhymrhq5ygjg1.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=8461abf1faa12c2debc006893eb3f9067b539c26

1.  Connected the PBIP to MCP via GitHub Copilot in VSC
2. Asked to make a blank table for SVG's named \_SVGMeasure
3. Made Claude Sonnet do the Data analysis for the data and then asked it to make a SVG canvas background template for the dashboard 

[canvas.svg](https://preview.redd.it/w67tc7g6vgjg1.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5268c24ffe2e887ffa362bcb28511f65d20f1ff)

   4. Now, based on the tile, have the AI generate SVG Image measures

  5. Based on the coordinates of the canvas background tiles, the AI will place the SVG Image measures on top of them 

  6. That’s it. Your no-GUI, code-based Power BI dashboard is ready.

  
**Key Takeaways** 

\- It is faster than building the dashboard manually when clear instructions to AI are provided.

\- With a single Prompt/instructions.md, you can make multiple pages in a couple of minutes 

\- The SVG Image / HTML content Visuals are way better and customizable than the default Power BI visuals

\- AI is doing the analysis, preparing the data, creating the formulas, handling the data modeling, working on the design, and generating the reports

\- It took me 4 minutes to make this page complete (including opening VSC and connecting MCP)

My girlfriend and I are going on vacation to Seattle for the first time starting the 29th and leaving on the 1st. We are looking for some people to hang with. Have some laughs and check out what seattle really has to offer. We are into urban exploring, grafgiti, sight seeing, Frisbee golf, pokemon go, getting coffee and treats, maybe have a few drinks now and then. We listen to grunge, metal, underground hip-hop ,etc. We are up for hikes in nature or just sitting around people watching. We are not crazy outgoing but we like to have fun with chill people. 4/20 friendly.",1,1771079009.0,seattleVacation,0,1.0,False
