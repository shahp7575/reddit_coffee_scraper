I usually do my coffee by French press and moka coffee methods. Recently I finished some barista lessons and I thought that it was time to get an espresso machine.

Did some research and saw a lot of posts suggesting to get a Breville Bambino or Bambino +. What do you guys think?

Also, I know that I’m gonna need a grinder machine, so I think that it would probably be better if the machine doesn’t have an integrated grinder.

Hope you guys can help me!

Im 26 years old (M), 5’8” tall, fairly new to Mumbai, and a software developer in Mumbai. Basically, I write code all day and try not to get lost in this huge city. 😅

I’ve been trying to get into a meaningful relationship, but it hasn’t been easy. I even tried dating apps like Bumble and Tinder—got a couple of matches but when I replied… nothing. Total silence. Being an average guy, I’ve realized online dating is basically a “good luck” game. So, I’ve decided to try the offline version—face-to-face, human interaction, remember that?

I believe real connections happen in person. Also, let’s be honest about looks—there’s nothing to hide here, just a genuine, down-to-earth guy hoping to find someone like-minded.

So here’s me putting myself out there: if even one like-minded girl reads this and thinks “maybe our vibes match,” let’s have a coffee ☕, chat, laugh, and figure out what works and what doesn’t.

May be this post seems funny to some people, but it’s the harsh reality for an average guy like me. I promise, no cheesy lines, just honesty, good conversation, and maybe some awkward laughs.

Let’s connect, share experiences, and create some meaningful moments together.",1,1759010425.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Every single time I go to Tim Hortons lately, it feels like I’m stepping into some kind of alternate dimension where time moves at half speed. I walk in, there’s maybe three people in line, a couple cars in the drive-thru… so I’m thinking, great, this will be quick. Oh no. That was my first mistake.

First, there’s the person at the till who seems to be typing my order into a NASA control panel because it takes 45 seconds just to input ‘medium double double.’ Then there’s the coffee person, who I swear moves slower than a sloth carrying groceries up a hill. Like, I’m watching them grab the cup like it’s the most delicate artifact in a museum. Then they take this long, thoughtful pause before finally filling it with coffee… like they’re trying to solve world peace with every pour.

And don’t even get me started on the donuts. The person in charge of the donuts looks like they’re on a spiritual journey back there. They open the case, look at the options for what feels like five minutes, maybe meditate for a bit, then finally place the donut in the bag like they’re presenting it to the king. By this point, I’ve aged three years.

The best part? Half the time, the staff will all kind of vanish for a minute or two. Like, you see them in the back, slowly drifting around, doing… something? But nothing seems to be happening. I’m convinced they’ve mastered the art of looking busy while time stands still.

Is this just my local Tim’s? Because it honestly feels like a Canada-wide phenomenon. My friends in other cities say the same thing. Tim Hortons used to be the place for quick coffee runs, but now it’s like you’re signing up for an all-day retreat. At this point, I could probably plant the coffee beans, harvest them, roast them, and brew my own cup before Tim’s finishes making mine.

So yeah, I had to ask… does anyone else feel like Tim’s staff are moving in actual slow motion, or am I losing my mind here?”

1ns7irx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BBLASPEZIA/comments/1ns7irx/bb_la_spezia_a_closer_look_at_comfort_and_charm/,B&B LA SPEZIA a closer look at comfort and charm,"Picking where to stay in Liguria is not as easy as youthink. You see a HOTEL LA SPEZIA, then someone points at a B&B LA SPEZIA, and later you notice a sign for an ALBERGO LA SPEZIA. Feels like the same thing, but not really. I thought it would not matter. It did. Changed how the trip felt, more than I expected.

# Why people land in La Spezia

Most only stop here for Cinque Terre. But once you spend anight, the city feels different. The port, the noise in the morning. Scooters, bells, people talking too loud at the market.

A [B&B LA SPEZIA](https://lapergolalaspezia.com) or HOTEL LA SPEZIA keeps you in thatmix. You can walk to old streets, grab bread, then catch the train. An ALBERGO LA SPEZIA often sits in quieter spots. Maybe that suits you more.

# Hotel B and B and albergo what is what

Not the same. Not even close. HOTEL LA SPEZIA: reception, rooms, staff in uniform. Youknow the drill. B&B LA SPEZIA: smaller, breakfast, chat with the host, advice on where to eat. ALBERGO LA SPEZIA: in between, sometimes plain, sometimes almost hotel, but feels more local.

# Why a B and B feels personal

The thing about a B&B LA SPEZIA is the people. The hostmight say “try the little trattoria two streets over.” Rooms do not match each other. Some old chairs, some modern lamps. Breakfast usually bread, fruit, coffee. Feels lived in.

Most are close to the station or the port. Saves you time.Out the door and gone.

# When hotel makes sense

Sometimes a HOTEL LA SPEZIA is easier. Work trip? Yes.Bigger groups? Yes. Families want staff all day, maybe a restaurant inside. Predictable. That is what hotel gives.

# Why albergo works too

An ALBERGO LA SPEZIA is simpler. Usually cheaper. Oftenfamily owned. Feels old style. Not polished, but fine. Close to markets or the castle. If you want plain, this is enough.

# Staying close to Cinque Terre

The trains run fast. From La Spezia to any of the five townsin half an hour. This is why people stay in B&B LA SPEZIA or HOTEL LA SPEZIA. An [ALBERGO LA SPEZIA](https://lapergolalaspezia.com/it/) gives the same access without CinqueTerre prices. Same sea, same views.

# Food and the local side

Food matters here. A B&B LA SPEZIA might be next to abakery. Or a trattoria with fresh fish. Pesto. Focaccia. Anchovies. Simple but better here.

From a HOTEL LA SPEZIA or ALBERGO LA SPEZIA, you can walk tothe Naval Museum, the market, the castle. Places that show daily life, not just tourist views.

# How to decide

There is no formula. Look at reviews, photos, then think.

B&B shows more personality. Hotel shows services. Albergo shows tradition. That is about it.

# Quick tips

Hotel if you want steady service.  
B&B if you want homelike.  
Albergo if you want simple.

Work leans hotel. Holidays lean B and B. Long stays leanalbergo.  
The choice between HOTEL LA SPEZIA, B&B LA SPEZIA, and ALBERGOLA SPEZIA shapes the trip. Hotel is steady. B and B is personal. Albergo is plain. The city itself gives you food, sea air, quick trains toCinque Terre. That is what stays with you when you leave.",1,1759010247.0,BBLASPEZIA,0,1.0,False

# Forget property, we bought a ‘boring’ business to get wealthy

​

Summarise

Retiring Baby Boomers are selling businesses to young couples like Ashley Linkewich and Joe Gaebel, who bought K&F Fabrications, a 29-year-old business on the Sunshine Coast. The couple, who moved from Canada, funded the acquisition with savings and a loan, facing challenges due to a lack of collateral. While the dream of business ownership is appealing, experts warn of the hard work, financial risks, and potential for disappointment, emphasising the importance of due diligence and realistic expectations.

​

After five months of due diligence and negotiations, the acquisition went through in December 2024, and they moved their lives to Queensland.

While they declined to reveal the purchase price, Linkewich and Gaebel say they spent hundreds of thousands, with the business costing “less than a house”.

Ashley Linkewich and Joe Gaebel bought the business from retiring Baby Boomers. Lou O’Brien

“There are great small business out there that are a couple of hundred thousand and if it flops, it’s probably not going to ruin you financially for the rest of your life,” Linkewich says.

And she’s an advocate of taking the leap when you’re young, before you have financial responsibilities such as kids and home mortgages to consider.

“The chance of us buying a business once we have young kids is just so slim, if we didn’t do it now, we probably wouldn’t have done it.

“If this thing does go pear shaped, then we will have learned so much, and it’s not going to destroy us forever. We’ll be able to recover. We can go back to corporate.”

# The business buying landscape

Since the pandemic, the number of people interested in working for themselves has increased, says Simon Bedard, founder and managing director of Exit Advisory Group and chair of the Australian Institute of Business Brokers.

“There’s a lot of people in corporate land who asked, ‘Is this really what I want for my life or do I want to be more of a master of my own destiny?’,” he says.

Juston Jirwander, director of Bishop Collins Chartered Accountants, which advises clients on both business sales and acquisitions, says the number of younger buyers is also on the rise.

He says that, like Gaebel, would-be buyers often come out of the tech industry and see an opportunity in legacy businesses that technology can add value to.

The other group of business buyers are people in midlife who may have been made redundant or have a “midlife crisis of sorts”, says Kieran Liston, the founder of accountancy and financial advice practice Liston Newton Advisory.

“It’s not uncommon for people in their late 40s to early 50s – because of a forced decision or one they have made themselves – to look to buy a business rather than continuing on as an employee,” he says.

Besides the autonomy, the perceived financial advantages are usually a strong pull, Jirwander says. “People believe that they have the ability to make more money as an entrepreneur, as their own boss.”

But running a business arguably carries a larger amount of risk than working as an employee – although buying an established business is seen as less risky than creating a start-up. Liston says some clients will opt for buying into a franchise for the same reason.

# Does buying a business lead to riches and freedom?

The difference between the dream and the reality can sometimes be stark.

Many business owners underpay themselves, with some not drawing a wage at all in the early years and Jirwander says that when the additional risk and hard work is considered, he questions why high-income earners would pursue the path of self-employment.

“If you could make more salary as an employee than you would bring home as a business owner, why would you do it? The only reason you would want to do that is that you think you’re going to increase the value of the business.”

But to achieve that, the experts agree that you have to be prepared to work – and hard.

They say people who believe they will gain freedom through self-employment may be dismayed to find themselves working harder than ever.

The difference between the dream of owning a business and the reality can sometimes be stark. Simon Letch 

“They’ve got this idea that after three months they’ll be having an afternoon off playing golf and the thing will run itself,” Liston says. “I say it takes three years to really know a business, the amount of work that’s involved in getting to know most businesses is extraordinarily high.”

Bedard adds that “it’s not going to be nine to five”. “To suggest that it’s easier and life’s just wonderful as a business owner, it’s not real.”

Jirwander estimates 90 per cent of potential business owners are “unrealistic” about the amount of effort that is likely to be involved, especially those that plan to appoint a manager to run the business for them.

“There is no such thing as buying an asset and just hoping that it just returns money and not having to do anything,” Jirwander says.

Linkewich and Gaebel can attest to the hard work involved, and the need to be prepared to get your hands dirty.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever worked so much in my whole life,” says Linkewich, who is working in the business full time as managing director.

“It hasn’t been anything close to what I’ve expected because nothing has gone to plan, but the business is still on track to possibly have the best year in its history.”

For Gaebel, K&F represents an additional job on top of his full-time role at Atlassian, which he decided to continue in to give the couple some breathing room financially and contingency funds for the business.

# How to fund a business acquisition

In their case, Linkewich and Gaebel – who funded the aquisition of K&F using savings and a loan – say that not owing a property they could put up as collateral proved problematic.

The found that without such collateral, the big banks wanted them to have a 50 per cent deposit, but they eventually found a smaller lender that was willing to take a chance and lend against their 20 per cent deposit.

“We are absolutely paying for that with the interest rate that we have on the loan,” Linkewich says, although they hope to refinance on better terms soon.

Bedard agrees that finding finance can be difficult.

“As a broad comment, I will say debt funding in Australia is poorly facilitated. Our banking system has gotten comfortable with making huge profits on risk-free lending.”

He adds that sellers are sometimes willing to provide vendor finance to get a deal over the line.

# 4 risks to watch for when buying a business

The experts say that there are a number of risks to look out for when running the rule over potential acquisitions. The four most common are:

**1. Structural marketplace changes**

Liston says that at one point in history, buying an Australia Post franchise or newsagency may have seemed like a solid investment – but times change, and with them, business models can become redundant.

“At one point those may have sold for five times net profit, but now you can hardly give them away. We’ve got clients that are actually locked into them because they can’t get out.”

**2. Inflated figures**

While due diligence will uncover a lot about a business, it is unlikely to tell you everything. Liston says a big red flag is when the figures have changed dramatically for the better in the past year before sale.

“They’ve obviously thought there was a sale on, and they’ve had to make the figures look good,” he says.

To protect against such financial risk, consider trying to negotiate an earn-out with the seller, where they get some of the money upfront, and the rest after a set period providing financial hurdles are cleared.

**3. Key man risk**

It’s important to assess how big a role the current owner plays in the success of the business. If the owner controls all the key relationships with customers and suppliers, there’s a good chance those relationships might walk out of the door with them.

“Is the business really dependent on the current owner weaving their magic to make the money come in the door?” Bedard says.

**4. Concentration risk**

Bedard says that if a business derives 70 per cent of its revenue from one customer, or is similarly reliant on one supplier, it could lead to a huge exposure if that relationship were to unwind.

# 3 lessons for would-be business owners

**1. Look beyond sexy industries**

Linkewich says businesses in boring industries can be a better bet than those in hot sectors.

“It’s not very sexy for people’s kids to want to take over the family manufacturing business or the family glass company. But these companies have been around for ages, and they’re often quite lucrative.”

She adds that they are also businesses that modernisation and the implementation of technology can add instant value to.

“One of the big reasons I wanted to get into manufacturing is because since it is such a legacy industry, I think there’s a lot of room for modernising that both with technology and just ways of working.”

**2. Get comfortable with risk**

While risk can be minimised by buying a solid, established business it will always be there – but depending on your circumstances, it can be mitigated.

Linkewich says that by buying a cheaper business you’re unlikely to risk financial ruin should it fail, especially if you have time on your side and can return to the corporate world if things don’t work out.

“There’s a real opportunity here for people that are willing to take a bit of extra risk, but it’s also not the riskiest thing you could do because many of these businesses have a 30 or 40 year trading history,” Linkewich says.

And the way Gaebel sees it, the bigger risk is not taking the risk. “There’s a cost to the safe and the planned and the common, getting your fortnightly salary. The cost is the opportunity cost,” he says.

**3. Expect the unexpected** 

If you discover that things were not quite what they seemed after you’ve completed on the deal, Linkewich says not to panic.

“You can never truly be prepared for what you uncover because you can only uncover so much in due diligence,” she says.

Likewise, if circumstances change rapidly after you come on board, you need to hold your nerve.

“Buying an old business there’s inevitably stuff that needs to be replaced, and it takes a lot more cash than anyone could predict or than what we modelled.

“There will be people that end up leaving, or there will be people that don’t like the things that you’re doing, or they like the old way of working, or there will be projects that get pushed back.

“I would encourage people not to be scared by that initial hit that they’re inevitably going to have to take,” Linkewich says.

My job requires standing, running around, carrying heavy things etc and I'm reaching my breaking point. I left my shift today in tears because my feet hurt so bad, but I don't think I qualify for disability, as I don't need a service animal or someone to take care of me. I don't even have a cane or anything so I can't claim I have a mobility aid. 

The obvious thing to do would be to get accommodations at my job but I really can't imagine what that would look like. It's a very narrow space behind the counter, and even when you're on till you still need to prepare drip coffees, teas, food etc. if I had a chair I'd still be getting up constantly, as well as being in everyone's way.  

I've tried shortening my shifts so I now only work 5 hours a day. I have good quality shoes and insoles. I also finished a medical office assistant program at a local community college (the best program in the city apparently) but has so far had absolutely no luck in the job hunt. I could apply for other cafes but the job market is absolutely garbage right now so I can't imagine I'd be able to find a place that'll hire someone that needs accommodations/can barely do the job at all (yes technically they can't discriminate because of disability but that's a hard thing to prove)

I feel like what would be best for me would be to go on EI while I hunt for a desk job but my understanding is that you can go on EI for a specific injury, and this is more like ten years of wear and tear catching up to me. Another complicating factor is that I don't have a doctor so I don't even know if I could prove that I'm not just whining.

I'm feeling very hopeless about my situation right now and dreading every shift that I work. I don't know what steps I can take besides endlessly applying for MOA jobs and hoping for the best. Can someone help me figure out what to do to make my situation better? ",2,1759009949.0,legaladvicecanada,4,1.0,False

I’m 26 years old (M), 5’8” tall, fairly new to Mumbai, and a software developer in Mumbai. Basically, I write code all day and try not to get lost in this huge city. 😅

I’ve been trying to get into a meaningful relationship, but it hasn’t been easy. I even tried dating apps like Bumble and Tinder—got a couple of matches but when I replied… nothing. Total silence. Being an average guy, I’ve realized online dating is basically a “good luck” game. So, I’ve decided to try the offline version—face-to-face, human interaction, remember that?

I believe real connections happen in person. Also, let’s be honest about looks—there’s nothing to hide here, just a genuine, down-to-earth guy hoping to find someone like-minded.

So here’s me putting myself out there: if even one like-minded girl reads this and thinks “maybe our vibes match,” let’s have a coffee ☕, chat, laugh, and figure out what works and what doesn’t.

May be this post seems funny to some people, but it’s the harsh reality for an average guy like me. I promise, no cheesy lines, just honesty, good conversation, and maybe some awkward laughs.

I have to say that I wasn’t sure what to expect before I arrived, I had heard many things. My expectations were blown out of the water! It is a beautiful place and while I am not a huge city lover, it is easily my favourite American city! I don’t think I had ever even considered moving to the states before I walked your streets for a few days. The rose garden, Japanese garden, and the Hoyt Arboretum wowed me. I caught a show at the Hollywood theatre and enjoyed some dumplings at Hawthorne Asylum. Even though it rained the whole time I had an awesome experience. 

I think my point is that Portland is a truly fascinating city filled with great people and culture (and coffee). I would love to return one day (feel free to drop recommendations for my next visit). Recent events struck a nerve with me I suppose and just wanted to extend a thank you from a northern friend. Hold strong, Portland seems to be filled with a resilient population.

My brother can be annoying sometimes like a lot of siblings can be but what makes me so mad sometimes and kinda makes me resent him is that he is such a slob and barely ever helps buy food. He has a decent job and gives my dad money for rent so he can live here but I don’t think that’s a good reason to be a slob. Whenever I go out to the kitchen after he’s done making food or eating it’s a mess (bread crumps everywhere, never does dishes, uncleaned messed everywhere in the kitchen, never cleans the dishes he made, i could keep going on for awhile). 

Me and my dad buy food but I barely ever see him buy food he just gets his coffee, creamer or sugar. He makes the most money out of me and my dad but chooses to spend it all on dumb stuff and not food or dish soap or something that would improve his life like a house. He eats a lot of food, leaves a mess on the table and then never cleans it. I’m always the person who cleans his messes and does the dishes because my dad is 60 and it’s the right thing to do but why can’t he chip in. 

If I say something to him he will probably never listen or just try to swat me off or start an argument. I have no problem helping around the house but my brother makes me be a maid or our house will look messy and nasty. ",2,1759009507.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False
1ns78gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1ns78gx/im_a_nurse_and_the_doctor_just_dropped_dead_but/,I’m a nurse and the doctor just dropped dead. But she kept completing surgeries.,"She looked like Gwyneth Paltrow or Marie Claire, maybe Katherine Heigl. I’m an L.P.N, a licensed practical nurse and I’ve been following around Dr. Lurra Collodi, the hospital's Head of Neuro Surgery lately. She was 6 '2, her skin as reflective as a doll's with enough elasticity, viscosity, and density to fit the void between memory foam and latex. Silky hair that's so fine, when I close my eyes it’s like wind passing me by. She has a butterfly tattoo on her left hip, right under where the Pelvis shows. And when I open my eyes again I see those, blue eyes.



In the summer before med school, I got restless and fearful of losing the education that I’d one day trade in for a more valuable reputation. Giving up my idle hands for the summer, I wait for the bus trying not to be too concise of the BO, standing across from an old lady. Getting to the hospital I change out of my pajamas for a quick shower, and get ready to finally see Lurra. It’s a long and tedious, not to mention restless process to fix someone's brain stem, and it should be. Grab a BA to get required prerecs, then take the MCAT and hope, if you haven't done enough already, to get accepted into Med school. After that it’s still a decade before I get any recognition for my long standing rejection of rest. I dodge the doctors in charge of giving me tasks, check the new pounds of flesh on clipboards and do my rounds. All day I stress over my own shortcomings while trying to make a lasting impression on the doctor who’s capable of giving me everything I want. I could rest lying on a lazy boy sitting in my den under my millennial gray mansion. When I first saw Lurra I knew that ideal wasn’t far off.



After a clever diversion triggered by an accomplishing coffee machine, I search for cases with a certain desirable staff member. Like an addict that only remembers the high, I pull the chart, avoiding eyes, slipping away and reconvening at the room, not even processing the time spent. Today I’m warming up with the failing respiratory system of a little kid, noticing Dr. Collodi walking by, I patiently wait for her to eventually find me. In the meantime I prepare for overbearing, worried parents bound to the girl whose pain is reason enough to rip anything apart. Keeping these dogs caged is some of the most rewarding work of the day. Silence before and as the door swings open, I come into sight and this time I hear nothing. 



Light dances within silicon tubes, working to assist the girl who’d been rendered an automaton with the most impressive function one could have. Clicks propelled and wholly dependent on the heart beats they’re mixed with, for they would surely cease in tandem. Painful series of sinuous strings, attempting to play something they’re incapable of remembering with every artificial breath. I hear pitiful drops brewing with a pungent odor in sharp contrast with the sterile hospital room. The clothes of the little girl are on a singular padded chair. Letting the door go, light catches the bedazzled pants and, for the benefit of us both, relieves me from the sight for a moment. I come back to find an encircling floral pattern of different colors, like members of an invisible college waiting to feast upon her remnants of life, they wait. I take my place beside them.



Reading the chart I remind myself, this girl had a stroke at just thirteen years old. She had, *Has* a heart complication that limits the oxygen she’s able to receive to her brain. A mistake made by an attendee with the dosage led to a spike in her blood pressure which created the right conditions for the stroke to take place. Poor pathetic thing, Dr.Collodi planned to fix this diversion which may not change anything, but it’ll help things from getting worse. And she’s going to let me watch. As kids we’re these things of almost infinite potential wasted on our own needs and the never ending quest to end them, and by virtue we rise above it all. After being born into this paradoxical existence, we owe it to ourselves to continue to fall while spinning towards a better landing. I really do have pity for this girl, whose spiral has landed her in our halls. Dr. Collodi walked in with one of the patient's parents.  



“Good morning Dr. Cole.” I say maybe too fast.



Noticing me with a glance, she stops mid sentence to reply. “Good morning, This is Emily’s mother. I was just going over the plan for this afternoon again. She's understandably hesitant but we’re ready, right?”



The parent lifts her chin up not quite meeting my stare. “I uhm. Yeah you know, what else would we be doing here. You know?”



“We’re going to do everything we can.” Words roll forth and out before I can make them sound nice. “I-I’m in the process of becoming a doctor myself, I’ll be assisting Dr.Collodi with Emily’s procedure.” putting everything together as I speak.



Their eyes meet and Collodi clarifies. “He’s just going to be assisting with sterilization and post op procedures.""



“Oh, well thank you for your help then”. 



“Alright, just give us some time to prepare and check up on some of our other patients.”



Dr.Collodi quickly wraps up while I’m already making my way out, Lurra follows. We move down the hall towards an elevator hub.  



NURSE AND LURRA WALK AND TALK, REFERENCE A DATE AND EMOTIONAL STUFF FOR HER. LURRA HAS A WEIRD SOUNDING GURGLY COUGH:).

“If you're going to be a doctor, you’re going to need to learn how to keep patients comfortable”. Dropping all warmth reserved for the patient.



“Well I needed a moment to process.” 



“Still your responsibility. I might have you sit with her during the surgery to learn something.”



“I’m sorry ma’am” Feeling the words escape my lungs, as if the silence sustained a vacuum. “I’ll make sure to- add it to my approach in the future.”



For the first time I let the business of the hospital seep into my consciousness. Different shades of beige punctuating slides of blue lined with white, following more lines of blue, beige, all lined with white. A frantic scramble of bees in a perpetual state of panic. These people are supposed to mend yet for our entire lives, or at least the decade it takes to get here keeps us under exponential stress. You'd think she’d be more caring.



She places her hand on her face. “I finished a five hour surgery, I’m gonna take a nap before the surgery.” It’s like she could say anything she wants. She pulls us to the side and calls the elevator. “Later I’ll need you to take over my rounds when I get off later tonight.” Hand falling to her side, her eyes snap up to catch me with a look. 



“Hey, I can count on you today, right.”



“Yeah of course-”



We're cutting people up and calling it progress. Even still, obvious results are obvious. But with the need to get consent for our work from any man made system, we have to take on all the unfortunate responsibilities that the system can’t handle. All this to say, there are some things nature can’t filter out.



I’ve lost out on so many out of circuit patients. Full families refusing treatment based on the out-of-pocket charges. 



“It’s hectic around here. It’s hard to just be sometimes. I’ve been trying meditation, sound bathing, connecting with nature, and all that bullshit. It doesn't work. The only thing I know is that when I’m carving a tumor out of a brain, or doing a retro-sigmoid craniotomy is when I can think without forcing it.” 



Tilted head and mouth just ajar, I catch her glance from the side. Falling in the depths of those eyes, they’re enough to demand warmth from me. Like solar flares going off in her irises, light dances. The enveloping cornea that pulls me in like the oppressive damp air of a morgue. How does she look so helpless after demonstrating again and again how much I rely on her. Looking at me like I’m just as far along as she is, every leap of faith with the watching expectation of a parent waiting for the first steps. Every step, she expects me to answer before her.



“I don’t know.” I say cliching my shirt.



“I didn’t ask anything.”



“Weren’t you?” 



“Yeah. So I got this thing tonight and it’s really important that my patients are in good hands. My friend and her partner are bringing their roommate over. Kinda an unofficial blind date.”



“Oh I didn’t know you were.” My hand moves up the brail painted across my back.”-Off. Tonight.”



“I told you” 



“Oh yeah, I uhh. Sorry the coffee is taking a minute.”



“I need you to focus. Get the rounds done and come wake me up in two hours, wake me up if any families come in or if a patient gets too loud.”



“Alright, Have a good nap- I guess.”



The elevator opens up, demanding Lurra away. She blazes through her instructions one more time before asking a question as the doors close. Finally waking up I ground myself in the context of the here and now. 



A rhythmic click accompanies me as I make my way down the hall.



Tub dub, tub dub.



I met Dr. Collodi and decided to pivot my practice to focus more on neuro. Specifically the brain stem, weird bird shaped thing, it’s pretty common knowledge that people can live a few seconds after it’s severed. I say knowledge, I actually know nothing about the moment when someone becomes brain dead, they're kinda just dead. We care about the general time people die, and if they stay dead, that’s kinda where the “care” for detail ends. I thought that choosing something out of her area of competition would give me the chance to better assist her, allow me to keep her as a fixture in my life. I’m constantly disappointed by the immaturity I found in my friend groups, but there’s not a moment where she doesn't shatter that illusion. It’s not like I care what I do surgery on anyway but the brain stem, It turns out to be one of my favorite parts. It goes down the whole spine, it’s like the Airport communications tower for the mind.



Making my way down the list of patients to check off,  I check on all the high maintenance cases first then leave the rest for the nurses they know. Leaving, I turn into an open floor plan that spans the length of the building. Tall windows with a ravine-like split joining the five floors, separating the sixth, used as a kind of rudimentary lobby for the helipad. No one actually expects to get service, it’s just for processing, still didn’t stop the architect from making it function like that. To make up for the unused space we filled it with bunks and called it extra sleeping space. Food courts line the first floor, making a V shaped island on the second we use to separate the families just getting in and the ones waiting for patients who are being seen. The rest are a mix of supply closets and rooms, the main storage is a sideways warehouse used to get supplies to all floors from the back wall. This is navigated by a freight elevator next to the only staircase, no one expects me to use it, still I use it to meet Lurra on the sixth floor. 



The elevator doors open and I walk out on to the sixth floor, I’m blinded by the sickening fluorescent lights. Stepping into a shell of a lobby lit only by the glow of white shades keeping light on a border. I find a lone coffee machine, set up against a pillar near the center of the room. I started the second pot of coffee for today. The second the machine starts I hear a harmonization behind me, not an echo or reverberation, or whatever. An independent, loud click followed by air escaping, something. Turning, attempting to meet the sound I find myself disorientated. Gaining my balance the sound is violently interrupted by a door slamming.



There’s doctors sleeping, using the bathroom on this floor. Still trying to quell this internal stew, and convincing myself it’s just the coffee I take a seat closer to the pot. The sound picks up again, it almost plays a tune as its rhythm speeds up. Coffee starts filling the pot and my head is spinning, at the same time gurgling rises betwixt the clicks and violent explosion of air. Anxiety, a lump in my chest perpetuated by the sound of death, I sit and covet my hands in each other. The coffee stops purring and the sound remains, then I finally become aware of eyes watching me.



Now aware of how still I’d become, I found it that much harder to maintain as such. The noise disappears once again with a hiss, after a beat of patient listening I stand up. Crossing from the center of the room to a distant wall I pull my resolve together remembering the surgery, and the reality that this is an un-used portation of an otherwise occupied hospital. Ignoring oddly organic sounds I look for Lurra, stepping behind the desk I walk along it into a back room where we keep the bunks. I find it to be empty, light spilling out from under a side door leading to the bathroom. 



“Lurra?” I push out.



After a long moment I hear “Hello?”



Dr. Lurra Collodi who had a date tonight, who sounds deflated .



“Hello?” I replied. “Dr.Collodi, are you in there?”



“Yeah, I’m just brushing my teeth.”



I take a seat on a nearby bed. I lay on my back and catch my breath. 



“This is some stressful work isn't it.”



“... -I don’t know.”



“This is good work, it’s double the pay I’m used to so there’s no issues there but-... When I get home from work I don’t really do anything, other than work and school there’s not a lot to do but personal work.” Just being here changes your perceptions. Everyday I see the exact results of carelessness, that being said anything not immediately life threatening seems so distant. “I want to keep doing this, I will.” stability without end, this job provides an extreme amount of stability for what. “I just also wonder if this is worth it in the long run. What's the incentive, you know?” A drowning echo fills the room, gurgling, sticky and crackling sounds erupt from the bathroom. Violent implosions followed by relieved exhales, labored all the way through, it’s almost impossible to tell when the vomiting started. I hear wet slaps before what must have been full cups of water being emptied on the linoleum. This takes place in the span of a few seconds before just as abruptly stopping. 



After a moment from the bathroom I hear.“Hey, could I ask you for something” 



I respond by standing up and confusingly saying. “Of course.""



“Could you go out into the supply closet, call a service ticket for the hospital custodians and bring back an out of order sign.”



“Why”



Being left with no response I just stand there, I wait for this hurried odder. Something rotten and wet. In silence I leave towards a separate back room where supplies are kept, is she okay? Coming back with an out of order sign and wet wipes, I’m met with Lurra sitting in a new pair of scrubs. 



“Oh, there you are. Are you ready for the surgery?”



“Yeah, are you?”



“Yeah of course.”



I furrow my brow. “Okay… I mean, are you okay? What just happened in there?”



She looks at me expectantly, shade shrouding the details of her face. “Getting ready for the surgery. You know.” Breaking our gaze she looks towards the bathroom. “Can you put that sign up please.”



Stepping up to the door I see it’s not quite closed but not enough so I could see inside. I look back to find Lurra’s gone, at the same time I hear a door close. She stood up and left without disturbing me, I debated investigating the bathroom. Pushing the sign against the door I open it just ajar, it’s dark but light reflects off a liquid on the ground. Accompanied by a truly horrid smell, spoiled food and perfume. I pull the door shut as I finish with the sign. 



I step out and immediately get scooped up by Lurra, asking me to follow and quicking making her way to the elevator. She’s already waiting in the car before I could stop, we’re moving down and like that we’re off. 



Doors close and we start moving down to the first floor, the lights are soft fluorescents, probably about to go out. No music, no particularly ear catching sounds, just the elevator. Lurra stands facing head on, trying to keep my eyes to myself. I go over the little girls chart again. After surgery it won’t be long till Lurra has that date, a blind date, is there really no one else she’d rather see? Letting my arms fall I catch a glance of Lurra before turning away.



“Hey Lurra?” I turn to meet her gaze immediately.



“Yes?” Her blue eyes, like a diagram of what I remember, I fall deep again. Superficial depth, like all focus had disappeared, for a moment I question if she’s sterling through me. Glossy, like light, resisted it. 



“That blind date. Is there-”



“I’m not going out anymore.”



“Wha- why?”



“I’ll be too busy, I have surgeries to do.”



“Well if your schedule is open again it would be cool to hang out.”



“I’ll need to check, I have surgeries to do.”



The abrupt nature of the statement, and her turn away put an unpleasant end to our conversation. Sitting in the silence I noticed a smell creep into the car, the morgue sits right beside the elevator in the basement so the smell of death wasn’t uncommon on the first or basement level. I look up and see we’re just on the third, the noise from a bit ago reenter my mind. The dry start, getting wetter, more labored, almost breathing noise.



I turn to look at Lurra again. “What happened in the bathroom up there”



She stands ignoring the statement, if it wasn’t for the lingering silence I’d question if she’d heard me at all. She just stood there, the doors open a few minutes of silence later. Without acknowledging me she steps out and towards the O.R. 

  


Trailing her we step into the pre-op room where we get ready to enter the O.R. Entering we find the girl laying on her side. Already put under and with sterile surgical drapes all around her, a post-op nurse is finishing on a square just behind the girl's right ear. They shaved then wiped away any stray hairs before sterilizing the spot, then they step away to make room for Lurra. Like a conductor taking a seat upon their perch, I’m instructed to hand Dr.Collodi a scalpel. She makes a door the size of the bald spot, then demands a drill before opening it up and removing a portion of the skull. Saving the fragment I hand her over special tools meant to remove the part of the brain that had seized up, hopefully over time this cavity will be filled. At which point the girl can start to learn what she forgot. 



Lurra looks upon the patch of exposed brain for a moment before inserting the tools. Confidently maneuvering them with a camera we start the process of finding the problem area. This typically takes an hour, Lurra was able to find it in fifteen minutes. This isn’t unheard of, of course, we’re looking for something, luckily we found it right out the gates. Still Lurra had an almost knowing confidence. Finding it with the camera, she grounds that then goes in with two long metallic chopsticks. Bony instruments with praying mantis like fillangies meant to slice and grab. She gently cuts around the problemed mass while lightly pulling at it with the other tool, pulling it inside the tube. For thirty quick minutes I watch as Collodi carves at the purpeling mass, in this time things had become pretty somber in preparation for the next big hurdle. While others are preparing I watch as things become unsettling still. The mass is still moving on the camera which is only able to capture a very obstructed view, but the mass seems almost out of sync with Lurra's movements to me. 



I watch closer and see that Dr.Collodie has stuck the instrument a full inch deeper than it should be, drastically uneven with the paring tool. I raise my eyes to Lurras to find hers already sterling into mine. 



“Excuse me, could you go get the parent. We’re almost done here, you're no longer needed, the other nurses will help with the post-op.”



“I- are-”



“Nurse, please go get this patient's parents.” 



Feeling the weight of the room's focus I move. Leaving towards the lobby being left with an unnerving feeling that I was being watched. Arriving at the front desk I’m informed that the mother had a personal emergency involving her other child and the grandmother. Details quickly fleeting from my attention I head back to pass on the information. Once I began to scrub in I realized that there’s no need, the O.R. was empty. Leaving confused, Lurra meets me. 



“Hey, where’s Emily”



Without letting her expression fall she says. “The girl passed.” eyes on the ground with a plastic expression. 



“Wh-How?”



“Soon after you left and during post-op she passed. They're going to do the autopsy in the morning but we don’t exactly know how.”



“Oh so what now?”



“Where’s the mother”



“She’s not here, she had to help her mother.” 



“I’ll need to inform the front desk” She starts heading off where I’d just come from.



“Dr.Collodi.” I announce. 



She stops and turns to face me.



“Do you think I could be a doctor, one day?”



All along she’d carried this plastered look on her face, but finally looking to her for real reassurance, I realized how unusual it was. She kept up this poker face, seeming to think about the question. But when she opened her mouth all I heard was that mucus filled gurgle, that inverted gasp for air, a twirling of saliva with every breath, like the most disturbing bird she sings this involuntary song. Like a siren's song decreasing the space between us, I freeze as her legs laboriously carry her ever closer. 



The uncanny behavior and t intensifying urgency of the situation, without thinking for a moment more, I turn and run. I run down the hall, hearing Lurra quickly behind me. Through the farthest door into the stairwell, I slam my body against the door Lurra pushes from the other side. Without too long to think I plan on finding an exit from the basement level, Lurra incrouches a few inches. I jump from the door and down the stairs, landing on the first landing before the basement floor I look up. The door has swung open and slammed an echo throughout the chamber, She stands in the doorway watching me. Not wanting to see what happens next, I quickly make my way down the stairs and into the basement hall. 



Adjusting to the cool air I collect myself. Debating whether or not I can leave I find that I don’t care, if anyone asks me about it I’ll refer them to security for verification. The closest exit is through the morgue right across from me, hospital morgues need to have some kinda public access so the families can retrieve their other family members. I step into the morgue, damp cool air, bodies awaiting autopsies line the freezer wall. A singular path of light leads to the middle of the room and past that I see the exit sign up a flight of stairs. Each step taken makes it tougher to ignore the void left by the obvious company unable to keep it. 



Arriving then eventually passing the last light I began to hear and try to rationalize the noise I know too well at this point. Behind me I hear the late death rattle of a body along the left wall, at first muffled before the rising and falling of sheets freed it. Turning my head to look over my left shoulder, in the corner of my eye I see the little girl looking at me. Mouth agape, foul echos resonating from her. We stand locked in each other's gaze as her breath picks up and drops again, with every cycle a single word becomes clearer. 



“no. no No. No No No, NOo NOo Noo.”



I leap from my frozen position, across the unlit floor, kicking plastic containers. Up the staircase and through the door before a foot could catch the last step, I slammed the door. 



Embraced by the evening air, looking across the parking lot the sun rests just under the city's skyline. Walking briskly to the bus stop looking over my shoulder, a question pierces through every thought I could manage.

1ns77mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ns77mp/im_a_nurse_and_the_doctor_just_dropped_dead_but/,I’m a nurse and the doctor just dropped dead. But she kept completing surgeries.,"She looked like Gwyneth Paltrow or Marie Claire, maybe Katherine Heigl. I’m an L.P.N, a licensed practical nurse and I’ve been following around Dr. Lurra Collodi, the hospital's Head of Neuro Surgery lately. She was 6 '2, her skin as reflective as a doll's with enough elasticity, viscosity, and density to fit the void between memory foam and latex. Silky hair that's so fine, when I close my eyes it’s like wind passing me by. She has a butterfly tattoo on her left hip, right under where the Pelvis shows. And when I open my eyes again I see those, blue eyes.



In the summer before med school, I got restless and fearful of losing the education that I’d one day trade in for a more valuable reputation. Giving up my idle hands for the summer, I wait for the bus trying not to be too concise of the BO, standing across from an old lady. Getting to the hospital I change out of my pajamas for a quick shower, and get ready to finally see Lurra. It’s a long and tedious, not to mention restless process to fix someone's brain stem, and it should be. Grab a BA to get required prerecs, then take the MCAT and hope, if you haven't done enough already, to get accepted into Med school. After that it’s still a decade before I get any recognition for my long standing rejection of rest. I dodge the doctors in charge of giving me tasks, check the new pounds of flesh on clipboards and do my rounds. All day I stress over my own shortcomings while trying to make a lasting impression on the doctor who’s capable of giving me everything I want. I could rest lying on a lazy boy sitting in my den under my millennial gray mansion. When I first saw Lurra I knew that ideal wasn’t far off.



After a clever diversion triggered by an accomplishing coffee machine, I search for cases with a certain desirable staff member. Like an addict that only remembers the high, I pull the chart, avoiding eyes, slipping away and reconvening at the room, not even processing the time spent. Today I’m warming up with the failing respiratory system of a little kid, noticing Dr. Collodi walking by, I patiently wait for her to eventually find me. In the meantime I prepare for overbearing, worried parents bound to the girl whose pain is reason enough to rip anything apart. Keeping these dogs caged is some of the most rewarding work of the day. Silence before and as the door swings open, I come into sight and this time I hear nothing. 



Light dances within silicon tubes, working to assist the girl who’d been rendered an automaton with the most impressive function one could have. Clicks propelled and wholly dependent on the heart beats they’re mixed with, for they would surely cease in tandem. Painful series of sinuous strings, attempting to play something they’re incapable of remembering with every artificial breath. I hear pitiful drops brewing with a pungent odor in sharp contrast with the sterile hospital room. The clothes of the little girl are on a singular padded chair. Letting the door go, light catches the bedazzled pants and, for the benefit of us both, relieves me from the sight for a moment. I come back to find an encircling floral pattern of different colors, like members of an invisible college waiting to feast upon her remnants of life, they wait. I take my place beside them.



Reading the chart I remind myself, this girl had a stroke at just thirteen years old. She had, *Has* a heart complication that limits the oxygen she’s able to receive to her brain. A mistake made by an attendee with the dosage led to a spike in her blood pressure which created the right conditions for the stroke to take place. Poor pathetic thing, Dr.Collodi planned to fix this diversion which may not change anything, but it’ll help things from getting worse. And she’s going to let me watch. As kids we’re these things of almost infinite potential wasted on our own needs and the never ending quest to end them, and by virtue we rise above it all. After being born into this paradoxical existence, we owe it to ourselves to continue to fall while spinning towards a better landing. I really do have pity for this girl, whose spiral has landed her in our halls. Dr. Collodi walked in with one of the patient's parents.  



“Good morning Dr. Cole.” I say maybe too fast.



Noticing me with a glance, she stops mid sentence to reply. “Good morning, This is Emily’s mother. I was just going over the plan for this afternoon again. She's understandably hesitant but we’re ready, right?”



The parent lifts her chin up not quite meeting my stare. “I uhm. Yeah you know, what else would we be doing here. You know?”



“We’re going to do everything we can.” Words roll forth and out before I can make them sound nice. “I-I’m in the process of becoming a doctor myself, I’ll be assisting Dr.Collodi with Emily’s procedure.” putting everything together as I speak.



Their eyes meet and Collodi clarifies. “He’s just going to be assisting with sterilization and post op procedures.""



“Oh, well thank you for your help then”. 



“Alright, just give us some time to prepare and check up on some of our other patients.”



Dr.Collodi quickly wraps up while I’m already making my way out, Lurra follows. We move down the hall towards an elevator hub.  



NURSE AND LURRA WALK AND TALK, REFERENCE A DATE AND EMOTIONAL STUFF FOR HER. LURRA HAS A WEIRD SOUNDING GURGLY COUGH:).

“If you're going to be a doctor, you’re going to need to learn how to keep patients comfortable”. Dropping all warmth reserved for the patient.



“Well I needed a moment to process.” 



“Still your responsibility. I might have you sit with her during the surgery to learn something.”



“I’m sorry ma’am” Feeling the words escape my lungs, as if the silence sustained a vacuum. “I’ll make sure to- add it to my approach in the future.”



For the first time I let the business of the hospital seep into my consciousness. Different shades of beige punctuating slides of blue lined with white, following more lines of blue, beige, all lined with white. A frantic scramble of bees in a perpetual state of panic. These people are supposed to mend yet for our entire lives, or at least the decade it takes to get here keeps us under exponential stress. You'd think she’d be more caring.



She places her hand on her face. “I finished a five hour surgery, I’m gonna take a nap before the surgery.” It’s like she could say anything she wants. She pulls us to the side and calls the elevator. “Later I’ll need you to take over my rounds when I get off later tonight.” Hand falling to her side, her eyes snap up to catch me with a look. 



“Hey, I can count on you today, right.”



“Yeah of course-”



We're cutting people up and calling it progress. Even still, obvious results are obvious. But with the need to get consent for our work from any man made system, we have to take on all the unfortunate responsibilities that the system can’t handle. All this to say, there are some things nature can’t filter out.



I’ve lost out on so many out of circuit patients. Full families refusing treatment based on the out-of-pocket charges. 



“It’s hectic around here. It’s hard to just be sometimes. I’ve been trying meditation, sound bathing, connecting with nature, and all that bullshit. It doesn't work. The only thing I know is that when I’m carving a tumor out of a brain, or doing a retro-sigmoid craniotomy is when I can think without forcing it.” 



Tilted head and mouth just ajar, I catch her glance from the side. Falling in the depths of those eyes, they’re enough to demand warmth from me. Like solar flares going off in her irises, light dances. The enveloping cornea that pulls me in like the oppressive damp air of a morgue. How does she look so helpless after demonstrating again and again how much I rely on her. Looking at me like I’m just as far along as she is, every leap of faith with the watching expectation of a parent waiting for the first steps. Every step, she expects me to answer before her.



“I don’t know.” I say cliching my shirt.



“I didn’t ask anything.”



“Weren’t you?” 



“Yeah. So I got this thing tonight and it’s really important that my patients are in good hands. My friend and her partner are bringing their roommate over. Kinda an unofficial blind date.”



“Oh I didn’t know you were.” My hand moves up the brail painted across my back.”-Off. Tonight.”



“I told you” 



“Oh yeah, I uhh. Sorry the coffee is taking a minute.”



“I need you to focus. Get the rounds done and come wake me up in two hours, wake me up if any families come in or if a patient gets too loud.”



“Alright, Have a good nap- I guess.”



The elevator opens up, demanding Lurra away. She blazes through her instructions one more time before asking a question as the doors close. Finally waking up I ground myself in the context of the here and now. 



A rhythmic click accompanies me as I make my way down the hall.



Tub dub, tub dub.



I met Dr. Collodi and decided to pivot my practice to focus more on neuro. Specifically the brain stem, weird bird shaped thing, it’s pretty common knowledge that people can live a few seconds after it’s severed. I say knowledge, I actually know nothing about the moment when someone becomes brain dead, they're kinda just dead. We care about the general time people die, and if they stay dead, that’s kinda where the “care” for detail ends. I thought that choosing something out of her area of competition would give me the chance to better assist her, allow me to keep her as a fixture in my life. I’m constantly disappointed by the immaturity I found in my friend groups, but there’s not a moment where she doesn't shatter that illusion. It’s not like I care what I do surgery on anyway but the brain stem, It turns out to be one of my favorite parts. It goes down the whole spine, it’s like the Airport communications tower for the mind.



Making my way down the list of patients to check off,  I check on all the high maintenance cases first then leave the rest for the nurses they know. Leaving, I turn into an open floor plan that spans the length of the building. Tall windows with a ravine-like split joining the five floors, separating the sixth, used as a kind of rudimentary lobby for the helipad. No one actually expects to get service, it’s just for processing, still didn’t stop the architect from making it function like that. To make up for the unused space we filled it with bunks and called it extra sleeping space. Food courts line the first floor, making a V shaped island on the second we use to separate the families just getting in and the ones waiting for patients who are being seen. The rest are a mix of supply closets and rooms, the main storage is a sideways warehouse used to get supplies to all floors from the back wall. This is navigated by a freight elevator next to the only staircase, no one expects me to use it, still I use it to meet Lurra on the sixth floor. 



The elevator doors open and I walk out on to the sixth floor, I’m blinded by the sickening fluorescent lights. Stepping into a shell of a lobby lit only by the glow of white shades keeping light on a border. I find a lone coffee machine, set up against a pillar near the center of the room. I started the second pot of coffee for today. The second the machine starts I hear a harmonization behind me, not an echo or reverberation, or whatever. An independent, loud click followed by air escaping, something. Turning, attempting to meet the sound I find myself disorientated. Gaining my balance the sound is violently interrupted by a door slamming.



There’s doctors sleeping, using the bathroom on this floor. Still trying to quell this internal stew, and convincing myself it’s just the coffee I take a seat closer to the pot. The sound picks up again, it almost plays a tune as its rhythm speeds up. Coffee starts filling the pot and my head is spinning, at the same time gurgling rises betwixt the clicks and violent explosion of air. Anxiety, a lump in my chest perpetuated by the sound of death, I sit and covet my hands in each other. The coffee stops purring and the sound remains, then I finally become aware of eyes watching me.



Now aware of how still I’d become, I found it that much harder to maintain as such. The noise disappears once again with a hiss, after a beat of patient listening I stand up. Crossing from the center of the room to a distant wall I pull my resolve together remembering the surgery, and the reality that this is an un-used portation of an otherwise occupied hospital. Ignoring oddly organic sounds I look for Lurra, stepping behind the desk I walk along it into a back room where we keep the bunks. I find it to be empty, light spilling out from under a side door leading to the bathroom. 



“Lurra?” I push out.



After a long moment I hear “Hello?”



Dr. Lurra Collodi who had a date tonight, who sounds deflated .



“Hello?” I replied. “Dr.Collodi, are you in there?”



“Yeah, I’m just brushing my teeth.”



I take a seat on a nearby bed. I lay on my back and catch my breath. 



“This is some stressful work isn't it.”



“... -I don’t know.”



“This is good work, it’s double the pay I’m used to so there’s no issues there but-... When I get home from work I don’t really do anything, other than work and school there’s not a lot to do but personal work.” Just being here changes your perceptions. Everyday I see the exact results of carelessness, that being said anything not immediately life threatening seems so distant. “I want to keep doing this, I will.” stability without end, this job provides an extreme amount of stability for what. “I just also wonder if this is worth it in the long run. What's the incentive, you know?” A drowning echo fills the room, gurgling, sticky and crackling sounds erupt from the bathroom. Violent implosions followed by relieved exhales, labored all the way through, it’s almost impossible to tell when the vomiting started. I hear wet slaps before what must have been full cups of water being emptied on the linoleum. This takes place in the span of a few seconds before just as abruptly stopping. 



After a moment from the bathroom I hear.“Hey, could I ask you for something” 



I respond by standing up and confusingly saying. “Of course.""



“Could you go out into the supply closet, call a service ticket for the hospital custodians and bring back an out of order sign.”



“Why”



Being left with no response I just stand there, I wait for this hurried odder. Something rotten and wet. In silence I leave towards a separate back room where supplies are kept, is she okay? Coming back with an out of order sign and wet wipes, I’m met with Lurra sitting in a new pair of scrubs. 



“Oh, there you are. Are you ready for the surgery?”



“Yeah, are you?”



“Yeah of course.”



I furrow my brow. “Okay… I mean, are you okay? What just happened in there?”



She looks at me expectantly, shade shrouding the details of her face. “Getting ready for the surgery. You know.” Breaking our gaze she looks towards the bathroom. “Can you put that sign up please.”



Stepping up to the door I see it’s not quite closed but not enough so I could see inside. I look back to find Lurra’s gone, at the same time I hear a door close. She stood up and left without disturbing me, I debated investigating the bathroom. Pushing the sign against the door I open it just ajar, it’s dark but light reflects off a liquid on the ground. Accompanied by a truly horrid smell, spoiled food and perfume. I pull the door shut as I finish with the sign. 



I step out and immediately get scooped up by Lurra, asking me to follow and quicking making her way to the elevator. She’s already waiting in the car before I could stop, we’re moving down and like that we’re off. 



Doors close and we start moving down to the first floor, the lights are soft fluorescents, probably about to go out. No music, no particularly ear catching sounds, just the elevator. Lurra stands facing head on, trying to keep my eyes to myself. I go over the little girls chart again. After surgery it won’t be long till Lurra has that date, a blind date, is there really no one else she’d rather see? Letting my arms fall I catch a glance of Lurra before turning away.



“Hey Lurra?” I turn to meet her gaze immediately.



“Yes?” Her blue eyes, like a diagram of what I remember, I fall deep again. Superficial depth, like all focus had disappeared, for a moment I question if she’s sterling through me. Glossy, like light, resisted it. 



“That blind date. Is there-”



“I’m not going out anymore.”



“Wha- why?”



“I’ll be too busy, I have surgeries to do.”



“Well if your schedule is open again it would be cool to hang out.”



“I’ll need to check, I have surgeries to do.”



The abrupt nature of the statement, and her turn away put an unpleasant end to our conversation. Sitting in the silence I noticed a smell creep into the car, the morgue sits right beside the elevator in the basement so the smell of death wasn’t uncommon on the first or basement level. I look up and see we’re just on the third, the noise from a bit ago reenter my mind. The dry start, getting wetter, more labored, almost breathing noise.



I turn to look at Lurra again. “What happened in the bathroom up there”



She stands ignoring the statement, if it wasn’t for the lingering silence I’d question if she’d heard me at all. She just stood there, the doors open a few minutes of silence later. Without acknowledging me she steps out and towards the O.R. 

  


Trailing her we step into the pre-op room where we get ready to enter the O.R. Entering we find the girl laying on her side. Already put under and with sterile surgical drapes all around her, a post-op nurse is finishing on a square just behind the girl's right ear. They shaved then wiped away any stray hairs before sterilizing the spot, then they step away to make room for Lurra. Like a conductor taking a seat upon their perch, I’m instructed to hand Dr.Collodi a scalpel. She makes a door the size of the bald spot, then demands a drill before opening it up and removing a portion of the skull. Saving the fragment I hand her over special tools meant to remove the part of the brain that had seized up, hopefully over time this cavity will be filled. At which point the girl can start to learn what she forgot. 



Lurra looks upon the patch of exposed brain for a moment before inserting the tools. Confidently maneuvering them with a camera we start the process of finding the problem area. This typically takes an hour, Lurra was able to find it in fifteen minutes. This isn’t unheard of, of course, we’re looking for something, luckily we found it right out the gates. Still Lurra had an almost knowing confidence. Finding it with the camera, she grounds that then goes in with two long metallic chopsticks. Bony instruments with praying mantis like fillangies meant to slice and grab. She gently cuts around the problemed mass while lightly pulling at it with the other tool, pulling it inside the tube. For thirty quick minutes I watch as Collodi carves at the purpeling mass, in this time things had become pretty somber in preparation for the next big hurdle. While others are preparing I watch as things become unsettling still. The mass is still moving on the camera which is only able to capture a very obstructed view, but the mass seems almost out of sync with Lurra's movements to me.

Feeling the weight of the room's focus I move. Leaving towards the lobby being left with an unnerving feeling that I was being watched.

Details quickly fleeting from my attention I head back to pass on the information. Once I began to scrub in I realized that there’s no need, the O.R. was empty. Leaving confused, Lurra meets me. 



“Hey, where’s Emily”



Without letting her expression fall she says. “The girl passed.” eyes on the ground with a plastic expression. 



“Wh-How?”



“Soon after you left and during post-op she passed. They're going to do the autopsy in the morning but we don’t exactly know how.”



“Oh so what now?”



“Where’s the mother”



“She’s not here, she had to help her mother.” 



“I’ll need to inform the front desk” She starts heading off where I’d just come from.



“Dr.Collodi.” I announce. 



She stops and turns to face me.



“Do you think I could be a doctor, one day?”



All along she’d carried this plastered look on her face, but finally looking to her for real reassurance, I realized how unusual it was. She kept up this poker face, seeming to think about the question. But when she opened her mouth all I heard was that mucus filled gurgle, that inverted gasp for air, a twirling of saliva with every breath, like the most disturbing bird she sings this involuntary song. Like a siren's song decreasing the space between us, I freeze as her legs laboriously carry her ever closer. 



The uncanny behavior and t intensifying urgency of the situation, without thinking for a moment more, I turn and run. I run down the hall, hearing Lurra quickly behind me. Through the farthest door into the stairwell, I slam my body against the door Lurra pushes from the other side. Without too long to think I plan on finding an exit from the basement level, Lurra incrouches a few inches. I jump from the door and down the stairs, landing on the first landing before the basement floor I look up. The door has swung open and slammed an echo throughout the chamber, She stands in the doorway watching me. Not wanting to see what happens next, I quickly make my way down the stairs and into the basement hall. 



Adjusting to the cool air I collect myself. Debating whether or not I can leave I find that I don’t care, if anyone asks me about it I’ll refer them to security for verification. The closest exit is through the morgue right across from me, hospital morgues need to have some kinda public access so the families can retrieve their other family members. I step into the morgue, damp cool air, bodies awaiting autopsies line the freezer wall. A singular path of light leads to the middle of the room and past that I see the exit sign up a flight of stairs. Each step taken makes it tougher to ignore the void left by the obvious company unable to keep it. 



Arriving then eventually passing the last light I began to hear and try to rationalize the noise I know too well at this point.

We stand locked in each other's gaze as her breath picks up and drops again, with every cycle a single word becomes clearer. 



“no. no No. No No No, NOo NOo Noo.”



I leap from my frozen position, across the unlit floor, kicking plastic containers. Up the staircase and through the door before a foot could catch the last step, I slammed the door.

But she kept completing surgeries.,"She looked like Gwyneth Paltrow or Marie Claire, maybe Katherine Heigl. I’m an L.P.N, a licensed practical nurse and I’ve been following around Dr. Lurra Collodi, the hospital's Head of Neuro Surgery lately. She was 6 '2, her skin as reflective as a doll's with enough elasticity, viscosity, and density to fit the void between memory foam and latex. Silky hair that's so fine, when I close my eyes it’s like wind passing me by. She has a butterfly tattoo on her left hip, right under where the Pelvis shows. And when I open my eyes again I see those, blue eyes.



In the summer before med school, I got restless and fearful of losing the education that I’d one day trade in for a more valuable reputation. Giving up my idle hands for the summer, I wait for the bus trying not to be too concise of the BO, standing across from an old lady. Getting to the hospital I change out of my pajamas for a quick shower, and get ready to finally see Lurra. It’s a long and tedious, not to mention restless process to fix someone's brain stem, and it should be. Grab a BA to get required prerecs, then take the MCAT and hope, if you haven't done enough already, to get accepted into Med school. After that it’s still a decade before I get any recognition for my long standing rejection of rest. I dodge the doctors in charge of giving me tasks, check the new pounds of flesh on clipboards and do my rounds. All day I stress over my own shortcomings while trying to make a lasting impression on the doctor who’s capable of giving me everything I want. I could rest lying on a lazy boy sitting in my den under my millennial gray mansion. When I first saw Lurra I knew that ideal wasn’t far off.



After a clever diversion triggered by an accomplishing coffee machine, I search for cases with a certain desirable staff member. Like an addict that only remembers the high, I pull the chart, avoiding eyes, slipping away and reconvening at the room, not even processing the time spent. Today I’m warming up with the failing respiratory system of a little kid, noticing Dr. Collodi walking by, I patiently wait for her to eventually find me. In the meantime I prepare for overbearing, worried parents bound to the girl whose pain is reason enough to rip anything apart. Keeping these dogs caged is some of the most rewarding work of the day. Silence before and as the door swings open, I come into sight and this time I hear nothing. 



Light dances within silicon tubes, working to assist the girl who’d been rendered an automaton with the most impressive function one could have. Clicks propelled and wholly dependent on the heart beats they’re mixed with, for they would surely cease in tandem. Painful series of sinuous strings, attempting to play something they’re incapable of remembering with every artificial breath. I hear pitiful drops brewing with a pungent odor in sharp contrast with the sterile hospital room. The clothes of the little girl are on a singular padded chair. Letting the door go, light catches the bedazzled pants and, for the benefit of us both, relieves me from the sight for a moment. I come back to find an encircling floral pattern of different colors, like members of an invisible college waiting to feast upon her remnants of life, they wait. I take my place beside them.



Reading the chart I remind myself, this girl had a stroke at just thirteen years old. She had, *Has* a heart complication that limits the oxygen she’s able to receive to her brain. A mistake made by an attendee with the dosage led to a spike in her blood pressure which created the right conditions for the stroke to take place. Poor pathetic thing, Dr.Collodi planned to fix this diversion which may not change anything, but it’ll help things from getting worse. And she’s going to let me watch. As kids we’re these things of almost infinite potential wasted on our own needs and the never ending quest to end them, and by virtue we rise above it all. After being born into this paradoxical existence, we owe it to ourselves to continue to fall while spinning towards a better landing. I really do have pity for this girl, whose spiral has landed her in our halls. Dr. Collodi walked in with one of the patient's parents.  



“Good morning Dr. Cole.” I say maybe too fast.



Noticing me with a glance, she stops mid sentence to reply. “Good morning, This is Emily’s mother. I was just going over the plan for this afternoon again. She's understandably hesitant but we’re ready, right?”



The parent lifts her chin up not quite meeting my stare. “I uhm. Yeah you know, what else would we be doing here. You know?”



“We’re going to do everything we can.” Words roll forth and out before I can make them sound nice. “I-I’m in the process of becoming a doctor myself, I’ll be assisting Dr.Collodi with Emily’s procedure.” putting everything together as I speak.



Their eyes meet and Collodi clarifies. “He’s just going to be assisting with sterilization and post op procedures.""



“Oh, well thank you for your help then”. 



“Alright, just give us some time to prepare and check up on some of our other patients.”



Dr.Collodi quickly wraps up while I’m already making my way out, Lurra follows. We move down the hall towards an elevator hub.  



NURSE AND LURRA WALK AND TALK, REFERENCE A DATE AND EMOTIONAL STUFF FOR HER. LURRA HAS A WEIRD SOUNDING GURGLY COUGH:).

“If you're going to be a doctor, you’re going to need to learn how to keep patients comfortable”. Dropping all warmth reserved for the patient.



“Well I needed a moment to process.” 



“Still your responsibility. I might have you sit with her during the surgery to learn something.”



“I’m sorry ma’am” Feeling the words escape my lungs, as if the silence sustained a vacuum. “I’ll make sure to- add it to my approach in the future.”



For the first time I let the business of the hospital seep into my consciousness. Different shades of beige punctuating slides of blue lined with white, following more lines of blue, beige, all lined with white. A frantic scramble of bees in a perpetual state of panic. These people are supposed to mend yet for our entire lives, or at least the decade it takes to get here keeps us under exponential stress. You'd think she’d be more caring.



She places her hand on her face. “I finished a five hour surgery, I’m gonna take a nap before the surgery.” It’s like she could say anything she wants. She pulls us to the side and calls the elevator. “Later I’ll need you to take over my rounds when I get off later tonight.” Hand falling to her side, her eyes snap up to catch me with a look. 



“Hey, I can count on you today, right.”



“Yeah of course-”



We're cutting people up and calling it progress. Even still, obvious results are obvious. But with the need to get consent for our work from any man made system, we have to take on all the unfortunate responsibilities that the system can’t handle. All this to say, there are some things nature can’t filter out.



I’ve lost out on so many out of circuit patients. Full families refusing treatment based on the out-of-pocket charges. 



“It’s hectic around here. It’s hard to just be sometimes. I’ve been trying meditation, sound bathing, connecting with nature, and all that bullshit. It doesn't work. The only thing I know is that when I’m carving a tumor out of a brain, or doing a retro-sigmoid craniotomy is when I can think without forcing it.” 



Tilted head and mouth just ajar, I catch her glance from the side. Falling in the depths of those eyes, they’re enough to demand warmth from me. Like solar flares going off in her irises, light dances. The enveloping cornea that pulls me in like the oppressive damp air of a morgue. How does she look so helpless after demonstrating again and again how much I rely on her. Looking at me like I’m just as far along as she is, every leap of faith with the watching expectation of a parent waiting for the first steps. Every step, she expects me to answer before her.



“I don’t know.” I say cliching my shirt.



“I didn’t ask anything.”



“Weren’t you?” 



“Yeah. So I got this thing tonight and it’s really important that my patients are in good hands. My friend and her partner are bringing their roommate over. Kinda an unofficial blind date.”



“Oh I didn’t know you were.” My hand moves up the brail painted across my back.”-Off. Tonight.”



“I told you” 



“Oh yeah, I uhh. Sorry the coffee is taking a minute.”



“I need you to focus. Get the rounds done and come wake me up in two hours, wake me up if any families come in or if a patient gets too loud.”



“Alright, Have a good nap- I guess.”



The elevator opens up, demanding Lurra away. She blazes through her instructions one more time before asking a question as the doors close. Finally waking up I ground myself in the context of the here and now. 



A rhythmic click accompanies me as I make my way down the hall.



Tub dub, tub dub.



I met Dr. Collodi and decided to pivot my practice to focus more on neuro. Specifically the brain stem, weird bird shaped thing, it’s pretty common knowledge that people can live a few seconds after it’s severed. I say knowledge, I actually know nothing about the moment when someone becomes brain dead, they're kinda just dead. We care about the general time people die, and if they stay dead, that’s kinda where the “care” for detail ends. I thought that choosing something out of her area of competition would give me the chance to better assist her, allow me to keep her as a fixture in my life. I’m constantly disappointed by the immaturity I found in my friend groups, but there’s not a moment where she doesn't shatter that illusion. It’s not like I care what I do surgery on anyway but the brain stem, It turns out to be one of my favorite parts. It goes down the whole spine, it’s like the Airport communications tower for the mind.



Making my way down the list of patients to check off,  I check on all the high maintenance cases first then leave the rest for the nurses they know. Leaving, I turn into an open floor plan that spans the length of the building. Tall windows with a ravine-like split joining the five floors, separating the sixth, used as a kind of rudimentary lobby for the helipad. No one actually expects to get service, it’s just for processing, still didn’t stop the architect from making it function like that. To make up for the unused space we filled it with bunks and called it extra sleeping space. Food courts line the first floor, making a V shaped island on the second we use to separate the families just getting in and the ones waiting for patients who are being seen. The rest are a mix of supply closets and rooms, the main storage is a sideways warehouse used to get supplies to all floors from the back wall. This is navigated by a freight elevator next to the only staircase, no one expects me to use it, still I use it to meet Lurra on the sixth floor. 



The elevator doors open and I walk out on to the sixth floor, I’m blinded by the sickening fluorescent lights. Stepping into a shell of a lobby lit only by the glow of white shades keeping light on a border. I find a lone coffee machine, set up against a pillar near the center of the room. I started the second pot of coffee for today. The second the machine starts I hear a harmonization behind me, not an echo or reverberation, or whatever. An independent, loud click followed by air escaping, something. Turning, attempting to meet the sound I find myself disorientated. Gaining my balance the sound is violently interrupted by a door slamming.



There’s doctors sleeping, using the bathroom on this floor. Still trying to quell this internal stew, and convincing myself it’s just the coffee I take a seat closer to the pot. The sound picks up again, it almost plays a tune as its rhythm speeds up. Coffee starts filling the pot and my head is spinning, at the same time gurgling rises betwixt the clicks and violent explosion of air. Anxiety, a lump in my chest perpetuated by the sound of death, I sit and covet my hands in each other. The coffee stops purring and the sound remains, then I finally become aware of eyes watching me.



Now aware of how still I’d become, I found it that much harder to maintain as such. The noise disappears once again with a hiss, after a beat of patient listening I stand up. Crossing from the center of the room to a distant wall I pull my resolve together remembering the surgery, and the reality that this is an un-used portation of an otherwise occupied hospital. Ignoring oddly organic sounds I look for Lurra, stepping behind the desk I walk along it into a back room where we keep the bunks. I find it to be empty, light spilling out from under a side door leading to the bathroom. 



“Lurra?” I push out.



After a long moment I hear “Hello?”



Dr. Lurra Collodi who had a date tonight, who sounds deflated .



“Hello?” I replied. “Dr.Collodi, are you in there?”



“Yeah, I’m just brushing my teeth.”



I take a seat on a nearby bed. I lay on my back and catch my breath. 



“This is some stressful work isn't it.”



“... -I don’t know.”



“This is good work, it’s double the pay I’m used to so there’s no issues there but-... When I get home from work I don’t really do anything, other than work and school there’s not a lot to do but personal work.” Just being here changes your perceptions. Everyday I see the exact results of carelessness, that being said anything not immediately life threatening seems so distant. “I want to keep doing this, I will.” stability without end, this job provides an extreme amount of stability for what. “I just also wonder if this is worth it in the long run. What's the incentive, you know?” A drowning echo fills the room, gurgling, sticky and crackling sounds erupt from the bathroom. Violent implosions followed by relieved exhales, labored all the way through, it’s almost impossible to tell when the vomiting started. I hear wet slaps before what must have been full cups of water being emptied on the linoleum. This takes place in the span of a few seconds before just as abruptly stopping. 



After a moment from the bathroom I hear.“Hey, could I ask you for something” 



I respond by standing up and confusingly saying. “Of course.""



“Could you go out into the supply closet, call a service ticket for the hospital custodians and bring back an out of order sign.”



“Why”



Being left with no response I just stand there, I wait for this hurried odder. Something rotten and wet. In silence I leave towards a separate back room where supplies are kept, is she okay? Coming back with an out of order sign and wet wipes, I’m met with Lurra sitting in a new pair of scrubs. 



“Oh, there you are. Are you ready for the surgery?”



“Yeah, are you?”



“Yeah of course.”



I furrow my brow. “Okay… I mean, are you okay? What just happened in there?”



She looks at me expectantly, shade shrouding the details of her face. “Getting ready for the surgery. You know.” Breaking our gaze she looks towards the bathroom. “Can you put that sign up please.”



Stepping up to the door I see it’s not quite closed but not enough so I could see inside. I look back to find Lurra’s gone, at the same time I hear a door close. She stood up and left without disturbing me, I debated investigating the bathroom. Pushing the sign against the door I open it just ajar, it’s dark but light reflects off a liquid on the ground. Accompanied by a truly horrid smell, spoiled food and perfume. I pull the door shut as I finish with the sign. 



I step out and immediately get scooped up by Lurra, asking me to follow and quicking making her way to the elevator. She’s already waiting in the car before I could stop, we’re moving down and like that we’re off. 



Doors close and we start moving down to the first floor, the lights are soft fluorescents, probably about to go out. No music, no particularly ear catching sounds, just the elevator. Lurra stands facing head on, trying to keep my eyes to myself. I go over the little girls chart again. After surgery it won’t be long till Lurra has that date, a blind date, is there really no one else she’d rather see? Letting my arms fall I catch a glance of Lurra before turning away.



“Hey Lurra?” I turn to meet her gaze immediately.



“Yes?” Her blue eyes, like a diagram of what I remember, I fall deep again. Superficial depth, like all focus had disappeared, for a moment I question if she’s sterling through me. Glossy, like light, resisted it. 



“That blind date. Is there-”



“I’m not going out anymore.”



“Wha- why?”



“I’ll be too busy, I have surgeries to do.”



“Well if your schedule is open again it would be cool to hang out.”



“I’ll need to check, I have surgeries to do.”



The abrupt nature of the statement, and her turn away put an unpleasant end to our conversation. Sitting in the silence I noticed a smell creep into the car, the morgue sits right beside the elevator in the basement so the smell of death wasn’t uncommon on the first or basement level. I look up and see we’re just on the third, the noise from a bit ago reenter my mind. The dry start, getting wetter, more labored, almost breathing noise.



I turn to look at Lurra again. “What happened in the bathroom up there”



She stands ignoring the statement, if it wasn’t for the lingering silence I’d question if she’d heard me at all. She just stood there, the doors open a few minutes of silence later. Without acknowledging me she steps out and towards the O.R. 

  


Trailing her we step into the pre-op room where we get ready to enter the O.R. Entering we find the girl laying on her side. Already put under and with sterile surgical drapes all around her, a post-op nurse is finishing on a square just behind the girl's right ear. They shaved then wiped away any stray hairs before sterilizing the spot, then they step away to make room for Lurra. Like a conductor taking a seat upon their perch, I’m instructed to hand Dr.Collodi a scalpel. She makes a door the size of the bald spot, then demands a drill before opening it up and removing a portion of the skull. Saving the fragment I hand her over special tools meant to remove the part of the brain that had seized up, hopefully over time this cavity will be filled. At which point the girl can start to learn what she forgot. 



Lurra looks upon the patch of exposed brain for a moment before inserting the tools. Confidently maneuvering them with a camera we start the process of finding the problem area. This typically takes an hour, Lurra was able to find it in fifteen minutes. This isn’t unheard of, of course, we’re looking for something, luckily we found it right out the gates. Still Lurra had an almost knowing confidence. Finding it with the camera, she grounds that then goes in with two long metallic chopsticks. Bony instruments with praying mantis like fillangies meant to slice and grab. She gently cuts around the problemed mass while lightly pulling at it with the other tool, pulling it inside the tube. For thirty quick minutes I watch as Collodi carves at the purpeling mass, in this time things had become pretty somber in preparation for the next big hurdle. While others are preparing I watch as things become unsettling still. The mass is still moving on the camera which is only able to capture a very obstructed view, but the mass seems almost out of sync with Lurra's movements to me. 



I watch closer and see that Dr.Collodie has stuck the instrument a full inch deeper than it should be, drastically uneven with the paring tool. I raise my eyes to Lurras to find hers already sterling into mine. 



“Excuse me, could you go get the parent. We’re almost done here, you're no longer needed, the other nurses will help with the post-op.”



“I- are-”



“Nurse, please go get this patient's parents.” 



Feeling the weight of the room's focus I move. Leaving towards the lobby being left with an unnerving feeling that I was being watched. Arriving at the front desk I’m informed that the mother had a personal emergency involving her other child and the grandmother. Details quickly fleeting from my attention I head back to pass on the information. Once I began to scrub in I realized that there’s no need, the O.R. was empty. Leaving confused, Lurra meets me. 



“Hey, where’s Emily”



Without letting her expression fall she says. “The girl passed.” eyes on the ground with a plastic expression. 



“Wh-How?”



“Soon after you left and during post-op she passed. They're going to do the autopsy in the morning but we don’t exactly know how.”



“Oh so what now?”



“Where’s the mother”



“She’s not here, she had to help her mother.” 



“I’ll need to inform the front desk” She starts heading off where I’d just come from.



“Dr.Collodi.” I announce. 



She stops and turns to face me.



“Do you think I could be a doctor, one day?”



All along she’d carried this plastered look on her face, but finally looking to her for real reassurance, I realized how unusual it was. She kept up this poker face, seeming to think about the question. But when she opened her mouth all I heard was that mucus filled gurgle, that inverted gasp for air, a twirling of saliva with every breath, like the most disturbing bird she sings this involuntary song. Like a siren's song decreasing the space between us, I freeze as her legs laboriously carry her ever closer. 



The uncanny behavior and t intensifying urgency of the situation, without thinking for a moment more, I turn and run. I run down the hall, hearing Lurra quickly behind me. Through the farthest door into the stairwell, I slam my body against the door Lurra pushes from the other side. Without too long to think I plan on finding an exit from the basement level, Lurra incrouches a few inches. I jump from the door and down the stairs, landing on the first landing before the basement floor I look up. The door has swung open and slammed an echo throughout the chamber, She stands in the doorway watching me. Not wanting to see what happens next, I quickly make my way down the stairs and into the basement hall. 



Adjusting to the cool air I collect myself. Debating whether or not I can leave I find that I don’t care, if anyone asks me about it I’ll refer them to security for verification. The closest exit is through the morgue right across from me, hospital morgues need to have some kinda public access so the families can retrieve their other family members. I step into the morgue, damp cool air, bodies awaiting autopsies line the freezer wall. A singular path of light leads to the middle of the room and past that I see the exit sign up a flight of stairs. Each step taken makes it tougher to ignore the void left by the obvious company unable to keep it. 



Arriving then eventually passing the last light I began to hear and try to rationalize the noise I know too well at this point. Behind me I hear the late death rattle of a body along the left wall, at first muffled before the rising and falling of sheets freed it. Turning my head to look over my left shoulder, in the corner of my eye I see the little girl looking at me. Mouth agape, foul echos resonating from her. We stand locked in each other's gaze as her breath picks up and drops again, with every cycle a single word becomes clearer. 



“no. no No. No No No, NOo NOo Noo.”



I leap from my frozen position, across the unlit floor, kicking plastic containers. Up the staircase and through the door before a foot could catch the last step, I slammed the door. 



Embraced by the evening air, looking across the parking lot the sun rests just under the city's skyline. Walking briskly to the bus stop looking over my shoulder, a question pierces through every thought I could manage.



“Is Dr.Collodi still alive?”

Over ten years ago, I made my first real friend at community college. We bonded over drawing, video games, and coffee, especially when we had classes together. Many guys found her attractive and constantly tried to show off, so I jokingly played the role of her “intimidating older brother” to keep them away. It actually worked, and even her real siblings didn’t mind. At that time, I didn’t have feelings for her yet.

After almost 2 years, she transferred to a college an hour away. That’s when I realized I had feelings. I could’ve confessed in the parking lot during our goodbye, but I didn’t—I was too scared of ruining our friendship.

A couple years later, she’d invite me to art nights or Smash Bros tournaments (we’d once been tag partners), but I couldn’t go because of school and lack of transportation. Eventually she moved farther north and went through a lot: unstable roommates, breakups, eviction, a car accident, and at one point working at a strip club just to survive. I worried, but she promised she’d stay safe. Much of this was during the pandemic, which made it harder.

Through it all, I kept holding on to her as “maybe the one.” My kindness had been taken for granted so many times by others, but she felt different. Years later, we finally had a phone call and caught up on everything. I confessed I had feelings back then, and she admitted she did too. She even said maybe there was still a chance for us. Our communication since then has been on and off, since life keeps us both busy.

Then I found out—through social media—that she had given birth about 3 years ago. I didn’t know until after the fact. The father was much older and quickly disappeared. It broke me for a couple weeks, but I eventually accepted it. She’s now in a better situation, surrounded by family, planning to go back to school to become a teacher while raising her child.

But just two days ago, I found out she’s expecting again. I messaged her, but haven’t gotten a reply yet. And now I’m stuck wondering: is she still worth fighting for? Or should I just move forward, accept my luck with relationships, and stop holding out hope?

Please know—this isn’t meant to defame her. I’m only sharing events as I remember them, to show how much I care about her well-being. I do love her platonically, though things are complicated when it comes to romance. I’d appreciate honest truths, insight, or opinions on whether I should keep trying, or finally let go.",1,1759009331.0,depression_help,1,1.0,False

But she kept completing surgeries.,"She looked like Gwyneth Paltrow or Marie Claire, maybe Katherine Heigl. I’m an L.P.N, a licensed practical nurse and I’ve been following around Dr. Lurra Collodi, the hospital's Head of Neuro Surgery lately. She was 6 '2, her skin as reflective as a doll's with enough elasticity, viscosity, and density to fit the void between memory foam and latex. Silky hair that's so fine, when I close my eyes it’s like wind passing me by. She has a butterfly tattoo on her left hip, right under where the Pelvis shows. And when I open my eyes again I see those, blue eyes.



In the summer before med school, I got restless and fearful of losing the education that I’d one day trade in for a more valuable reputation. Giving up my idle hands for the summer, I wait for the bus trying not to be too concise of the BO, standing across from an old lady. Getting to the hospital I change out of my pajamas for a quick shower, and get ready to finally see Lurra. It’s a long and tedious, not to mention restless process to fix someone's brain stem, and it should be. Grab a BA to get required prerecs, then take the MCAT and hope, if you haven't done enough already, to get accepted into Med school. After that it’s still a decade before I get any recognition for my long standing rejection of rest. I dodge the doctors in charge of giving me tasks, check the new pounds of flesh on clipboards and do my rounds. All day I stress over my own shortcomings while trying to make a lasting impression on the doctor who’s capable of giving me everything I want. I could rest lying on a lazy boy sitting in my den under my millennial gray mansion. When I first saw Lurra I knew that ideal wasn’t far off.



After a clever diversion triggered by an accomplishing coffee machine, I search for cases with a certain desirable staff member. Like an addict that only remembers the high, I pull the chart, avoiding eyes, slipping away and reconvening at the room, not even processing the time spent. Today I’m warming up with the failing respiratory system of a little kid, noticing Dr. Collodi walking by, I patiently wait for her to eventually find me. In the meantime I prepare for overbearing, worried parents bound to the girl whose pain is reason enough to rip anything apart. Keeping these dogs caged is some of the most rewarding work of the day. Silence before and as the door swings open, I come into sight and this time I hear nothing. 



Light dances within silicon tubes, working to assist the girl who’d been rendered an automaton with the most impressive function one could have. Clicks propelled and wholly dependent on the heart beats they’re mixed with, for they would surely cease in tandem. Painful series of sinuous strings, attempting to play something they’re incapable of remembering with every artificial breath. I hear pitiful drops brewing with a pungent odor in sharp contrast with the sterile hospital room. The clothes of the little girl are on a singular padded chair. Letting the door go, light catches the bedazzled pants and, for the benefit of us both, relieves me from the sight for a moment. I come back to find an encircling floral pattern of different colors, like members of an invisible college waiting to feast upon her remnants of life, they wait. I take my place beside them.



Reading the chart I remind myself, this girl had a stroke at just thirteen years old. She had, *Has* a heart complication that limits the oxygen she’s able to receive to her brain. A mistake made by an attendee with the dosage led to a spike in her blood pressure which created the right conditions for the stroke to take place. Poor pathetic thing, Dr.Collodi planned to fix this diversion which may not change anything, but it’ll help things from getting worse. And she’s going to let me watch. As kids we’re these things of almost infinite potential wasted on our own needs and the never ending quest to end them, and by virtue we rise above it all. After being born into this paradoxical existence, we owe it to ourselves to continue to fall while spinning towards a better landing. I really do have pity for this girl, whose spiral has landed her in our halls. Dr. Collodi walked in with one of the patient's parents.  



“Good morning Dr. Cole.” I say maybe too fast.



Noticing me with a glance, she stops mid sentence to reply. “Good morning, This is Emily’s mother. I was just going over the plan for this afternoon again. She's understandably hesitant but we’re ready, right?”



The parent lifts her chin up not quite meeting my stare. “I uhm. Yeah you know, what else would we be doing here. You know?”



“We’re going to do everything we can.” Words roll forth and out before I can make them sound nice. “I-I’m in the process of becoming a doctor myself, I’ll be assisting Dr.Collodi with Emily’s procedure.” putting everything together as I speak.



Their eyes meet and Collodi clarifies. “He’s just going to be assisting with sterilization and post op procedures.""



“Oh, well thank you for your help then”. 



“Alright, just give us some time to prepare and check up on some of our other patients.”



Dr.Collodi quickly wraps up while I’m already making my way out, Lurra follows. We move down the hall towards an elevator hub.  



NURSE AND LURRA WALK AND TALK, REFERENCE A DATE AND EMOTIONAL STUFF FOR HER. LURRA HAS A WEIRD SOUNDING GURGLY COUGH:).

“If you're going to be a doctor, you’re going to need to learn how to keep patients comfortable”. Dropping all warmth reserved for the patient.



“Well I needed a moment to process.” 



“Still your responsibility. I might have you sit with her during the surgery to learn something.”



“I’m sorry ma’am” Feeling the words escape my lungs, as if the silence sustained a vacuum. “I’ll make sure to- add it to my approach in the future.”



For the first time I let the business of the hospital seep into my consciousness. Different shades of beige punctuating slides of blue lined with white, following more lines of blue, beige, all lined with white. A frantic scramble of bees in a perpetual state of panic. These people are supposed to mend yet for our entire lives, or at least the decade it takes to get here keeps us under exponential stress. You'd think she’d be more caring.



She places her hand on her face. “I finished a five hour surgery, I’m gonna take a nap before the surgery.” It’s like she could say anything she wants. She pulls us to the side and calls the elevator. “Later I’ll need you to take over my rounds when I get off later tonight.” Hand falling to her side, her eyes snap up to catch me with a look. 



“Hey, I can count on you today, right.”



“Yeah of course-”



We're cutting people up and calling it progress. Even still, obvious results are obvious. But with the need to get consent for our work from any man made system, we have to take on all the unfortunate responsibilities that the system can’t handle. All this to say, there are some things nature can’t filter out.



I’ve lost out on so many out of circuit patients. Full families refusing treatment based on the out-of-pocket charges. 



“It’s hectic around here. It’s hard to just be sometimes. I’ve been trying meditation, sound bathing, connecting with nature, and all that bullshit. It doesn't work. The only thing I know is that when I’m carving a tumor out of a brain, or doing a retro-sigmoid craniotomy is when I can think without forcing it.” 



Tilted head and mouth just ajar, I catch her glance from the side. Falling in the depths of those eyes, they’re enough to demand warmth from me. Like solar flares going off in her irises, light dances. The enveloping cornea that pulls me in like the oppressive damp air of a morgue. How does she look so helpless after demonstrating again and again how much I rely on her. Looking at me like I’m just as far along as she is, every leap of faith with the watching expectation of a parent waiting for the first steps. Every step, she expects me to answer before her.



“I don’t know.” I say cliching my shirt.



“I didn’t ask anything.”



“Weren’t you?” 



“Yeah. So I got this thing tonight and it’s really important that my patients are in good hands. My friend and her partner are bringing their roommate over. Kinda an unofficial blind date.”



“Oh I didn’t know you were.” My hand moves up the brail painted across my back.”-Off. Tonight.”



“I told you” 



“Oh yeah, I uhh. Sorry the coffee is taking a minute.”



“I need you to focus. Get the rounds done and come wake me up in two hours, wake me up if any families come in or if a patient gets too loud.”



“Alright, Have a good nap- I guess.”



The elevator opens up, demanding Lurra away. She blazes through her instructions one more time before asking a question as the doors close. Finally waking up I ground myself in the context of the here and now. 



A rhythmic click accompanies me as I make my way down the hall.



Tub dub, tub dub.



I met Dr. Collodi and decided to pivot my practice to focus more on neuro. Specifically the brain stem, weird bird shaped thing, it’s pretty common knowledge that people can live a few seconds after it’s severed. I say knowledge, I actually know nothing about the moment when someone becomes brain dead, they're kinda just dead. We care about the general time people die, and if they stay dead, that’s kinda where the “care” for detail ends. I thought that choosing something out of her area of competition would give me the chance to better assist her, allow me to keep her as a fixture in my life. I’m constantly disappointed by the immaturity I found in my friend groups, but there’s not a moment where she doesn't shatter that illusion. It’s not like I care what I do surgery on anyway but the brain stem, It turns out to be one of my favorite parts. It goes down the whole spine, it’s like the Airport communications tower for the mind.



Making my way down the list of patients to check off,  I check on all the high maintenance cases first then leave the rest for the nurses they know. Leaving, I turn into an open floor plan that spans the length of the building. Tall windows with a ravine-like split joining the five floors, separating the sixth, used as a kind of rudimentary lobby for the helipad. No one actually expects to get service, it’s just for processing, still didn’t stop the architect from making it function like that. To make up for the unused space we filled it with bunks and called it extra sleeping space. Food courts line the first floor, making a V shaped island on the second we use to separate the families just getting in and the ones waiting for patients who are being seen. The rest are a mix of supply closets and rooms, the main storage is a sideways warehouse used to get supplies to all floors from the back wall. This is navigated by a freight elevator next to the only staircase, no one expects me to use it, still I use it to meet Lurra on the sixth floor. 



The elevator doors open and I walk out on to the sixth floor, I’m blinded by the sickening fluorescent lights. Stepping into a shell of a lobby lit only by the glow of white shades keeping light on a border. I find a lone coffee machine, set up against a pillar near the center of the room. I started the second pot of coffee for today. The second the machine starts I hear a harmonization behind me, not an echo or reverberation, or whatever. An independent, loud click followed by air escaping, something. Turning, attempting to meet the sound I find myself disorientated. Gaining my balance the sound is violently interrupted by a door slamming.



There’s doctors sleeping, using the bathroom on this floor. Still trying to quell this internal stew, and convincing myself it’s just the coffee I take a seat closer to the pot. The sound picks up again, it almost plays a tune as its rhythm speeds up. Coffee starts filling the pot and my head is spinning, at the same time gurgling rises betwixt the clicks and violent explosion of air. Anxiety, a lump in my chest perpetuated by the sound of death, I sit and covet my hands in each other. The coffee stops purring and the sound remains, then I finally become aware of eyes watching me.



Now aware of how still I’d become, I found it that much harder to maintain as such. The noise disappears once again with a hiss, after a beat of patient listening I stand up. Crossing from the center of the room to a distant wall I pull my resolve together remembering the surgery, and the reality that this is an un-used portation of an otherwise occupied hospital. Ignoring oddly organic sounds I look for Lurra, stepping behind the desk I walk along it into a back room where we keep the bunks. I find it to be empty, light spilling out from under a side door leading to the bathroom. 



“Lurra?” I push out.



After a long moment I hear “Hello?”



Dr. Lurra Collodi who had a date tonight, who sounds deflated .



“Hello?” I replied. “Dr.Collodi, are you in there?”



“Yeah, I’m just brushing my teeth.”



I take a seat on a nearby bed. I lay on my back and catch my breath. 



“This is some stressful work isn't it.”



“... -I don’t know.”



“This is good work, it’s double the pay I’m used to so there’s no issues there but-... When I get home from work I don’t really do anything, other than work and school there’s not a lot to do but personal work.” Just being here changes your perceptions. Everyday I see the exact results of carelessness, that being said anything not immediately life threatening seems so distant. “I want to keep doing this, I will.” stability without end, this job provides an extreme amount of stability for what. “I just also wonder if this is worth it in the long run. What's the incentive, you know?” A drowning echo fills the room, gurgling, sticky and crackling sounds erupt from the bathroom. Violent implosions followed by relieved exhales, labored all the way through, it’s almost impossible to tell when the vomiting started. I hear wet slaps before what must have been full cups of water being emptied on the linoleum. This takes place in the span of a few seconds before just as abruptly stopping. 



After a moment from the bathroom I hear.“Hey, could I ask you for something” 



I respond by standing up and confusingly saying. “Of course.""



“Could you go out into the supply closet, call a service ticket for the hospital custodians and bring back an out of order sign.”



“Why”



Being left with no response I just stand there, I wait for this hurried odder. Something rotten and wet. In silence I leave towards a separate back room where supplies are kept, is she okay? Coming back with an out of order sign and wet wipes, I’m met with Lurra sitting in a new pair of scrubs. 



“Oh, there you are. Are you ready for the surgery?”



“Yeah, are you?”



“Yeah of course.”



I furrow my brow. “Okay… I mean, are you okay? What just happened in there?”



She looks at me expectantly, shade shrouding the details of her face. “Getting ready for the surgery. You know.” Breaking our gaze she looks towards the bathroom. “Can you put that sign up please.”



Stepping up to the door I see it’s not quite closed but not enough so I could see inside. I look back to find Lurra’s gone, at the same time I hear a door close. She stood up and left without disturbing me, I debated investigating the bathroom. Pushing the sign against the door I open it just ajar, it’s dark but light reflects off a liquid on the ground. Accompanied by a truly horrid smell, spoiled food and perfume. I pull the door shut as I finish with the sign. 



I step out and immediately get scooped up by Lurra, asking me to follow and quicking making her way to the elevator. She’s already waiting in the car before I could stop, we’re moving down and like that we’re off. 



Doors close and we start moving down to the first floor, the lights are soft fluorescents, probably about to go out. No music, no particularly ear catching sounds, just the elevator. Lurra stands facing head on, trying to keep my eyes to myself. I go over the little girls chart again. After surgery it won’t be long till Lurra has that date, a blind date, is there really no one else she’d rather see? Letting my arms fall I catch a glance of Lurra before turning away.



“Hey Lurra?” I turn to meet her gaze immediately.



“Yes?” Her blue eyes, like a diagram of what I remember, I fall deep again. Superficial depth, like all focus had disappeared, for a moment I question if she’s sterling through me. Glossy, like light, resisted it. 



“That blind date. Is there-”



“I’m not going out anymore.”



“Wha- why?”



“I’ll be too busy, I have surgeries to do.”



“Well if your schedule is open again it would be cool to hang out.”



“I’ll need to check, I have surgeries to do.”



The abrupt nature of the statement, and her turn away put an unpleasant end to our conversation. Sitting in the silence I noticed a smell creep into the car, the morgue sits right beside the elevator in the basement so the smell of death wasn’t uncommon on the first or basement level. I look up and see we’re just on the third, the noise from a bit ago reenter my mind. The dry start, getting wetter, more labored, almost breathing noise.



I turn to look at Lurra again. “What happened in the bathroom up there”



She stands ignoring the statement, if it wasn’t for the lingering silence I’d question if she’d heard me at all. She just stood there, the doors open a few minutes of silence later. Without acknowledging me she steps out and towards the O.R. 

  


Trailing her we step into the pre-op room where we get ready to enter the O.R. Entering we find the girl laying on her side. Already put under and with sterile surgical drapes all around her, a post-op nurse is finishing on a square just behind the girl's right ear. They shaved then wiped away any stray hairs before sterilizing the spot, then they step away to make room for Lurra. Like a conductor taking a seat upon their perch, I’m instructed to hand Dr.Collodi a scalpel. She makes a door the size of the bald spot, then demands a drill before opening it up and removing a portion of the skull. Saving the fragment I hand her over special tools meant to remove the part of the brain that had seized up, hopefully over time this cavity will be filled. At which point the girl can start to learn what she forgot. 



Lurra looks upon the patch of exposed brain for a moment before inserting the tools. Confidently maneuvering them with a camera we start the process of finding the problem area. This typically takes an hour, Lurra was able to find it in fifteen minutes. This isn’t unheard of, of course, we’re looking for something, luckily we found it right out the gates. Still Lurra had an almost knowing confidence. Finding it with the camera, she grounds that then goes in with two long metallic chopsticks. Bony instruments with praying mantis like fillangies meant to slice and grab. She gently cuts around the problemed mass while lightly pulling at it with the other tool, pulling it inside the tube. For thirty quick minutes I watch as Collodi carves at the purpeling mass, in this time things had become pretty somber in preparation for the next big hurdle. While others are preparing I watch as things become unsettling still. The mass is still moving on the camera which is only able to capture a very obstructed view, but the mass seems almost out of sync with Lurra's movements to me. 



I watch closer and see that Dr.Collodie has stuck the instrument a full inch deeper than it should be, drastically uneven with the paring tool. I raise my eyes to Lurras to find hers already sterling into mine. 



“Excuse me, could you go get the parent. We’re almost done here, you're no longer needed, the other nurses will help with the post-op.”



“I- are-”



“Nurse, please go get this patient's parents.” 



Feeling the weight of the room's focus I move. Leaving towards the lobby being left with an unnerving feeling that I was being watched. Arriving at the front desk I’m informed that the mother had a personal emergency involving her other child and the grandmother. Details quickly fleeting from my attention I head back to pass on the information. Once I began to scrub in I realized that there’s no need, the O.R. was empty. Leaving confused, Lurra meets me. 



“Hey, where’s Emily”



Without letting her expression fall she says. “The girl passed.” eyes on the ground with a plastic expression. 



“Wh-How?”



“Soon after you left and during post-op she passed. They're going to do the autopsy in the morning but we don’t exactly know how.”



“Oh so what now?”



“Where’s the mother”



“She’s not here, she had to help her mother.” 



“I’ll need to inform the front desk” She starts heading off where I’d just come from.



“Dr.Collodi.” I announce. 



She stops and turns to face me.



“Do you think I could be a doctor, one day?”



All along she’d carried this plastered look on her face, but finally looking to her for real reassurance, I realized how unusual it was. She kept up this poker face, seeming to think about the question. But when she opened her mouth all I heard was that mucus filled gurgle, that inverted gasp for air, a twirling of saliva with every breath, like the most disturbing bird she sings this involuntary song. Like a siren's song decreasing the space between us, I freeze as her legs laboriously carry her ever closer. 



The uncanny behavior and t intensifying urgency of the situation, without thinking for a moment more, I turn and run. I run down the hall, hearing Lurra quickly behind me. Through the farthest door into the stairwell, I slam my body against the door Lurra pushes from the other side. Without too long to think I plan on finding an exit from the basement level, Lurra incrouches a few inches. I jump from the door and down the stairs, landing on the first landing before the basement floor I look up. The door has swung open and slammed an echo throughout the chamber, She stands in the doorway watching me. Not wanting to see what happens next, I quickly make my way down the stairs and into the basement hall. 



Adjusting to the cool air I collect myself. Debating whether or not I can leave I find that I don’t care, if anyone asks me about it I’ll refer them to security for verification. The closest exit is through the morgue right across from me, hospital morgues need to have some kinda public access so the families can retrieve their other family members. I step into the morgue, damp cool air, bodies awaiting autopsies line the freezer wall. A singular path of light leads to the middle of the room and past that I see the exit sign up a flight of stairs. Each step taken makes it tougher to ignore the void left by the obvious company unable to keep it. 



Arriving then eventually passing the last light I began to hear and try to rationalize the noise I know too well at this point. Behind me I hear the late death rattle of a body along the left wall, at first muffled before the rising and falling of sheets freed it. Turning my head to look over my left shoulder, in the corner of my eye I see the little girl looking at me. Mouth agape, foul echos resonating from her. We stand locked in each other's gaze as her breath picks up and drops again, with every cycle a single word becomes clearer. 



“no. no No. No No No, NOo NOo Noo.”



I leap from my frozen position, across the unlit floor, kicking plastic containers. Up the staircase and through the door before a foot could catch the last step, I slammed the door. 



Embraced by the evening air, looking across the parking lot the sun rests just under the city's skyline. Walking briskly to the bus stop looking over my shoulder, a question pierces through every thought I could manage.



“Is Dr.Collodi still alive?”

1ns74xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ns74xv/its_been_a_year_since_our_towns_adults/,It's been a year since our town's adults disappeared. Everyone thinks it was ME.,"I was screaming at Mom when she exploded.

One minute she was completely in control of the argument, shooting me the mother of all glares across the dining room table, and the next she was dripping from my face like congealed spaghetti sauce.

Her voice was still alive in my ears, even with her staining my cheeks.

Dripping from my lashes.

I could taste her in my mouth.

""You're a child,"" Mom’s voice echoed in my mind.

""I'm old enough to drive a car,"" I had said matter-of-factly, waving my spoon in protest. 

I reached for my favorite cereal, but she slapped my hand away and placed a bowl of plain oats in front of me. 

I had been cursed with an almond Mom. 

Which meant the only snacks I ever saw had raisins instead of chocolate chips.

Breakfast was always the root of all disagreements in the Sinclair household. Mom wasn’t a morning person.

My brother and sister had headed to school early.

I couldn’t imagine why.

""With your father supervising,"" Mom’s grip on her coffee tightened. I could tell she was ready to blow up, but I was determined to change her mind.

Her argument was that she didn’t want me to get hurt, but I knew it went deeper than that. Mom wanted to ruin my life.

She was an expert at it, already forbidding me from going out of town and enforcing a curfew.

""I said no, and I mean no,"" Mom said with a sigh.

""You're inexperienced. When you’re eighteen, I’ll think about it. End of conversation."" She prodded the table impatiently. ""Eat your breakfast, please.""

""But that’s not fair."" I could feel my blood boiling. ""Why am I the one being punished? You’re giving Sera lessons!”

She fixed me with a warning look. ""You’re not being punished.""

""I clearly am,"" I retorted. ""I don’t see this same energy with Nathaniel!""

Mom sighed. ""Your brother is one year older. He is old enough to drive a car. I’m finished discussing this matter with you. If you disagree, you’re free to move out and make up your own rules.""

I slammed my spoon on the table. ""But—""

Mom sipped her coffee. ""End of conversation.""

""You’re not even being fair!""

Mom’s eyes narrowed. ""End,"" she put heavy emphasis on the word, ""of con—""

I didn’t even want to hear it. She was so stubborn. Even more childish than me, and I was supposed to be the kid.

Instead of listening to her, I pressed my hands over my ears and screamed in frustration. 

My own words trembled on my lips, halting, when something warm splashed across my face, followed by a high-pitched ringing in my ears. 

I felt the shock of it, rich copper filling my mouth and splattering over my eyes.

Initially, I thought she'd gone to the extreme and thrown her coffee in my face. 

But coffee wasn't this thick and coppery, clinging to my lashes and blurring my vision. It sounded like a nuclear bomb had gone off right in front of me. A slowly expanding bright light, darkness speckling across my eyes, and then… nothing. 

Mom was there, scowling at me disapprovingly, and then she wasn't. 

I remember her face being carved with morning sunlight filtering through the blinds, her loose ponytail trailing down her back, and her bright pink bathrobe.

I blinked slowly, the ringing sound growing louder, more intense. Like a singular coin rattling around in my skull. 

The sunlight was still there. But it was blocked out, only existing in strands of glittering light peeking through the intense smear of red covering my eyes.

She was everywhere, and yet also somehow still existing in front of me, her torso swaying back and forth like a bad fucking cartoon.

Blinking red from my eyes, I could sense a cry slowly clawing its way up my throat. 

Different shades of red covered our kitchen, painting the walls and dripping from the countertop.

The coin rattling in my skull stopped dancing, my ears popped, and the world came to a grinding stop around me.

Something wet and fleshy dropped from the ceiling, and the scream that had been wrangled in my throat, fighting for an escape, slipped out in a sob that wracked my chest.

Mom felt like congealed spaghetti sauce clinging to my face, pieces of her skull sticking to my pajamas.

When her torso smacked onto the ground, a horrifying cavern where her head used to be, I stumbled back, slipping in the spreading red pool gliding across our kitchen tiles. 

I remembered how to move. In one stride, I was out of the kitchen, gasping for breath, my hands on my knees. 

In two strides, I was standing on our doorstep staring dazedly at a crashed car in the middle of the road.

Several of them scattered down the block. I recognized this one.

Mrs. Petra's Honda Civic.

The car had flipped onto its side, but I could see the scarlet dripping from the windows. There was someone in there.

A little girl, five or six years old.

Her mouth was wide, O-shaped, streaks of red pooling down her face, dark ringlets of hair stuck to her pale skin. 

Emily, her daughter. I didn't hear her cries until my ears popped again. 

But this time it wasn't just Emily. Screams were erupting across my neighborhood. 

Our town had come to a standstill, shrieking car alarms joining the cacophony of cries enveloping together. 

Pulling Emily out of the smoking wreck of the car, I covered the little girl's eyes and held her to my chest. 

What was left of Mrs. Petra was slumped in her seatbelt. 

It wasn't just my mother and Mrs. Petra.

After taking Emily home, the effects of seeing my mother blown to pieces right in front of me started to blossom. 

I scratched at the skin of my arm, but I couldn't get her off of me. She was caked into my hair and glued to my lashes.

I spat several times, and then my gut lurched, heaving up undigested cereal.

In a daze, I checked every house. Each one held a similar scene: an explosion of grisly red, and children without parents.

Once the ringing in my ears subsided and I regained some control over myself. 

I joined the growing crowd of kids searching for answers. A kid on a skateboard told me there had been a crash at the end of the road, and I remembered my siblings. 

I headed toward the school, feeling sick to my stomach.

I found them among a group of kids, sitting on the sidewalk, looking dazed.

They didn’t react when I tried to hug them. Sera’s eyes were vacant, unseeing caverns staring into oblivion.

Nathaniel wouldn’t look me in the eye, squeezing me a little too tightly, pressing his head into my shoulder still stained with our mother.

He was a shell of his former self, the brother I had playfully fought with just hours earlier because he refused to let me drive his car. 

Sera had wanted to ride the bus, and in a mark of rebellion, Nathaniel had followed her.

If they had decided to drive to school, they could have been dead.

Nathaniel dropped his head into his lap, panting into his jeans.

Sera kept shooting me hopeful looks.

Like I would know what to do.

Two years younger than me, my little sister was already looking at me as if I were an adult. 

Their bus had overturned, intense red seeping onto the road, shattered windows, and headless bodies littering the sidewalk. 

Kids wandered around, confused, covered in what remained of the bus driver.

Nathaniel and Sera seemed to be the only ones consciously awake while others cried out for their parents. 

The three of us hugged, but I could barely feel my siblings wrapped around me. I had no idea how to tell them that our mother’s blood was all over me.

From their expressions, Nathaniel wrapping Sera into a hug and my sister sobbing into his chest, they already knew.

Our town had been normal, like every other, and in the blink of an eye, everything was gone.

Parents. We were covered in them. Teachers. Upon pushing through the school entrance, there was carnage.

Traumatized fourteen-year-olds were hysterical, dripping in scarlet, while the older kids seized the opportunity to run wild without adult authority, trashing classrooms and raiding vending machines. It was everyone.

99.9% of our town's population exploded that day, but it was my mother who was still staining my face, her blood ingrained into my flesh. 

I couldn't scrub her off of me, no matter what I did. 

The outside came to help in a matter of hours. 

I wouldn't call it ""help"" though. 

According to the outside, we were a town going through an unprecedented event. Which meant a quarantine cutting us off from the outside world. 

After briefing us in the school auditorium, we were told not to panic, and that help was coming. 

Spoiler alert: they were scared of us and what they thought was a contagion, so that so-called *help* didn't exist. 

That left babies without mother's,  the preschoolers without parental figures, and an entire school of teenagers to fend for themselves. 

You would think a group of kids would know what to do in a town-wide apocalypse, right? 

Especially when we had been abandoned by the outside world. 

In the first few weeks, we went kind of insane. Lord of the flies, insane. 

If you were vocal, you became a leader. 

And that meant the popular kids started to take control, taking advantage of kids with no family and nothing to lose, and recruiting them into gangs. 

Thankfully, that stopped when help did eventually come. 

Several drones were sent into our quarantine zone one month into the town-wide lockdown. 

They brought boxes full of medical supplies, food, electronics (despite them turning off the internet two months later due to a breach in security. 

Wendy Carmichael had made a now deleted  reddit post entitled ""We are TRAPPED! The story of my town under quarantine."") 

Wendy quickly became an outsider, after we were forced to hand over all of our electronics. 

There were also instructions on building a community in unprecedented times. 

We were told to elect a leader, a spokesperson who would make the rules. Gracie Lockhart became that person. 

She was the only one who wanted to run, and I guess everyone was scared of her because her now dead father happened to be mayor. 

Still though, kids wanted someone to look up to, someone to tell them what to do and give them a sense of purpose. 

Rules were put into place and everyone over the age of 13 were given a job, whether that was a cook at the university where meals were served, or stuck in the preschool with the kids.

In the first month, I was a delivery girl. When the electronics were still working, kids used all of that pent up frustration and trauma on shopping. 

So, I would wake up at 5am every day, bike to the barrier standing between our town and the outside world, and pick up the growing mountain of Amazon packages dumped on our side. 

I enjoyed my time as a delivery girl. I used it as a distraction from thinking about Mom's death. 

I barely saw my brother and sister, apart from at night. 

The three of us had taken up residence in a random house we'd found. 

Sera liked the swimming pool, but we chose it because it was far away from our parents. 

Sera's job was at the kindergarten, which she hated with a passion. While Nathaniel was an unwilling member of the research committee.

Not exactly a job that helped us, but Gracie and her carefully chosen council, who were just literally her friends, forced my brother and several others to scour the town and find out how this happened. 

Nathaniel said it was just an excuse for the popular kids to slack off.

We already had a scientific explanation, presented to us by the CDC themselves. 

It was a contagion that worked like spontaneous human combustion, and seemed to be leaving children alone. 

Gracie's group were obsessed with this huge conspiracy that went from aliens, to a lab-leak at the local university where they were convinced biological weapons were being made. 

Nathaniel had requested several times to be given another job– but one particular girl on the research committee had a crush on my brother. 

With her being so close to Gracie and the newly instated town council, she had a certain amount of authority, and could abuse it anyway she wanted. And fuck, did she *abuse* it. 

Gradually, as it became progressively more obvious that the outside world had left us to rot, and our community started to run out of the rations provided for us, the council began to take advantage of the amount of power they had. 

Sure, blame it on repressed trauma or PTSD. 

But I would go as far to say these kids were sociopaths. 

We called them The Dark Days. 

Because in a matter of weeks, our world started to come apart. 

It started with a message from the outside, that our food was delayed. 

So, we starved. The kids in power started getting bored. Kids were refusing to work without food. 

Normal crashed and burned, humanity bleeding away into something else. 

Those in authoritative positions were no longer quietly plucking the good looking guys and girls for their own personal pleasure. 

They were ordering our 'police force', a small group of volunteers, to drag them from their homes and present them to the council. 

*Please bring ALL chocolate to the council.*

*Guys with gross fucking hair cuts (I'm talking about YOU Oliver Bentley) are no longer allowed inside the cafeteria. Cut your hair and look decent, or starve.*

*Any cute dogs must be handed over.* 

*If you're physically attractive and want one of the last cans of soup, you can earn it. ONLY hot guys and girls! If you look like a hobbit, you'll be turned away.*

So yeah, normal began to crumble.

We tried to uphold it, but when the council started using older kids as toys and playthings, that was when our little community fell apart. 

Nathaniel was one of those chosen to *serve* the council, in what started as a stupid announcement, and quickly turned into a rule. 

Those who were chosen to be right hands to the council must NOT resist, or their loved ones would suffer. 

We were starving, delirious, and going crazy. 

Before our leader could go full Lord of the Flies, however, the outside world stepped in. Thank god. 

Gracie had her leadership revoked, along with her council, and all of her orders were thankfully banned. 

Nathaniel and the others were freed. Sera and I dragged him from a hotel room, which looked innocent enough. 

We found him playing Switch games cross legged on the floor. 

According to Nathaniel, there was a lot of PG13 non-consensual groping. 

He laughed it off, but there was an emptiness in his eyes I didn't like.

His smile was too big. Sera pointed out blood on the bed sheets, but I blocked it out, nodding dizzily when Nathaniel insisted he was fine. 

The perpetrator, who had my brother and five other senior girls and guys trapped in her hotel room fashioned into a sex den, was nowhere to be seen. 

Probably hiding in shame.  

I called it out as sexual assault and thankfully, more kids spoke out. Gracie was indirectly arrested. Meaning, as soon as the quarantine was over, she and her little group were in big trouble. 

I heard the charges were severe. Forced imprisonment and non-consensual sex.

For the time being, they were put on house arrest.

Thankfully, a new council was built from kids with actual intelligence and a passion for leadership. 

Liam Cartwright became our leader, and in his first role of replacement mayor, he demanded the soldiers bring us enough food and supplies to last us for a month.

The outside world reluctantly complied and we went back to normal. Ish. 

The girl who sexually assaulted my brother, Tally Edwards,  was officially a missing person, which became our first real case. 

Liam put together a force of ten able bodied kids to act as a police force and investigate the girl's disappearance. 

I got my job back as a delivery girl. When our Internet was cut off though, I became a sort-of food delivery service instead. 

But I liked it.

There was something therapeutic about awaiting our daily shipments, watching the outside world continue while we had come to a grinding halt. 

A year passed. Without parents, adults, and normality. 

But we made it work. We were a bunch of sixteen and seventeen year olds trying to keep afloat. Normal. But just like the world outside, death existed in our makeshift community too. Five kids.

Mostly from neglect. 

Taryn James and her friends had found a dead baby inside the wreck of a car. A fifteen year old girl had jumped out of a tree on a dare and landed head first. 

Three toddlers had come down with fevers that killed them despite us having the right medical supplies. 

We might have had medicine, but the kids working at the hospital had no idea what they were doing. Why would they? 

The eldest was seventeen, and he ran away, puking into his hand, when the fifteen year old was brought in, half of her skull caved in. 

The outside world only helped us with food. The rest, we had to fend for ourselves. 

The assholes didn't even send in medics. In their words, it was a risk they couldn't take. 

Little kids were dying, but because of a phantom *contagion* that was yet to claim any more lives, they couldn't save them. 

Kids weren't just dying, they were disappearing too. 

The missing had doubled. 

Two kids were now gone, both of them part of Gracie's original council, and Gracie herself had somehow managed to build her own little cult. 

She believed that God had taken her friends, and they had simply followed our parents to heaven. Judgement day was a new one. 

The week before, Gracie was screaming about aliens and lights in the sky when I biked past the school, where a concerning number of followers sat in a circle around her. 

Now she was convinced her friends had been raptured. 

Cliques had formed around town, which became noticeable on my bike ride. 

You can't be cut off from the outside without forming a cult-like group. 

But hey, we all had our ways of coping with losses we couldn't even register.

I had my own group. My fellow delivery kids. We weren't exactly a cult, but we were a family, and we had cute lime green uniforms and caps. 

The sun was setting when I was starting my night shift, sitting on the barrier, my legs dangling. 

The sky was a smear of orange and red, and I found myself hypnotised by the dying sunlight illuminating the clouds. 

I wasn't technically allowed to sit on the barrier.

If I fell off, I was donezo. But it was fun to get a peek into the outside world. 

If I tilted my head at just the right angle, I could see a fully functioning Mcdonalds in the distance, ironically bathed in a heavenly glow. 

Below me, the winding road was blocked off with yellow tape, barricades in place. 

Nathaniel was on my mind. His new job was taking up all of his time, but when he was free, he still didn't come home. 

I told him to request a zoom appointment with a therapist. 

The outside world was offering them every week in the library, where there was restricted internet access. But he kept saying he was good. 

He seemed like it on the outside. 

On weekends, Nate would act like the annoying older brother he had always been, fighting over the shower, and hiding cereal from Sera and I. 

But even when he was laughing, his expression didn't match his eyes. I wanted to talk about what happened with him and Tally. 

Maybe he thought it was his fault she was missing. Sera had told me to step off for a while, though this had been going on for months. It's like something inside was killing him, eating away at him. 

And I knew it was what happened inside that hotel suite. 

""Testing, testing,"" a familiar drawl crackled through my talkie sticking out of my pocket and cutting through my thoughts. Nathaniel was fine, I thought. 

I was just over reacting. My colleague's voice was a welcome distraction, bleeding into the peaceful silence. The British accent was the icing on the cake.

""Do they have ramen? I repeat. We are in short supply of ramen,"" He paused. ""Especially the carbonara style ones. You know, the ones in the TikTok store."" 

He sighed, his voice immediately bringing my mood up. 

""Ah, yes, TikTok! I miss my daily supply of brain rotting dopamine. Do you remember those pool filling videos? They were what made me realize I had undiagnosed ADHD.""

Jude Lightwood  was an unlikely friend. I barely knew him before the quarantine, and now I knew his deepest, darkest secrets he spilled to me during our night shift awaiting our weekly delivery. 

Jude took the other side of town, while I took the main entrance. We spent most of our time talking on the talkies, or in his case, giving me his entire life story.

Still though, nothing beat staying up until the early hours of the morning, watching the first flicker of dawn appear in the sky, listening to him half deliriously reenact the entire first season of Breaking Bad from memory. 

Yes, even with the voices. 

I missed a delivery once because I was almost on the edge of hysterics, laughing at his Jesse Pinkman impression which was to a freakin' T. 

Pulling out my talkie, I pressed the button, swinging my legs in mid-air. ""You do know they're MRE'S, right? I don't think we have a choice. We'll be lucky to get rice and chicken."" I paused. 

""Also, you don't seem like the type of guy who used to go on TikTok."" 

He wasn't. Before the disaster, Jude spent most of his time in the school library. 

He was known for his side hustle, selling *candy* to seniors. He started as a British exchange student who nobody could understand, and quickly rose up in the social hierarchy due to his accent. 

I only knew him from English class, when our teacher had asked him what the capital of Australia was, and Jude, half asleep, had responded with, ""Huhh? New Zealand?"" 

He was officially 'New Zealand' to me, until he formally introduced himself on my second day on the job, offering me coffee, and spilling it all over himself.  

Jude scoffed. I enjoyed his presence. Even if it was just his voice. 

""I just said I watched pool filling videos, like, in a total trance,"" he laughed, but then his laugh kind of choked up. 

I could tell he was having a light bulb moment. He had them a lot, and they were all related to what happened to the town's adults.

""What if it's like, Gods?"" Jude had proclaimed into the whipping wind one morning, the two of us cycling to work. 

When I twisted around to shoot him a pointed look, he shrugged, cycling harder, reddish dark hair flying in a blur around him. ""It's probable! Like, what if Zeus is pissed? He's punishing us!” 

*""Aliens?""* he'd said, while we were lifting packages onto the loading bay. 

I hit him with a package in my hands. 

“Cthulhu?” Jude mumbled, half asleep, the two of us labelling envelopes. 

*What if it's microchips in our brains?""* 

Jude came out with it through a mouthful of mash potato during lunch, the two of us lounging on the school roof. 

His second epiphany of the day. When I shoved him, he laughed. 

This guy's charming smile made it hard for me to hate him. 

He came up with these ""What if's"" to drive me crazy, I swear.

His *'theories'* stretched all the way to our town somehow being related to The Simpson Movie. Though this time, I caught a certain seriousness in his tone. 

""What if *that* is what saved us?"" 

I pondered his question, watching a bird swoop across the sky. ""You think TikTok saved us from combusting?"" 

""No!"" he laughed. ""Well, yes. Stay with me here, but adults don't use it much, right?"" 

Jude took a deep breath. I could tell he had already jumped to the next tangent. 

""Wait. I can see a group of kids in the town across from us eating Five Guys. My mouth is watering,"" he groaned. ""This is torture. I can see the fried onions. I can see the animal style fries and sauce!"" 

Jeez, how good was his sight? 

""Do you have binoculars?"" I couldn't resist a laugh. 

""No! Yes. Maybe. I'm just borrowing them.""

""Jude,"" I said, shuffling uncomfortably. My butt had gone to sleep. ""Are you sitting on the barrier?"" 

He didn't reply for a moment. ""That depends. Is a certain Liam Cartwright with you?"" 

I spluttered, holding the button down. ""You think our seventeen year old mayor is checking up on the delivery kids? Poor Liam is probably asleep.""

""Oh god, yeah,"" I could sense him making a face. ""Our boy is starting to look like a divorced father of three."" 

Jude cleared his throat, and the feedback went right through me. 

""I am sitting on the barrier, by the way. I can see Orion from here. I used to look at constellations with my Mum. She had one of those cool ancient telescopes.""

Something sickly twisted in my gut. Tipping my head back, I searched for the star, though I wasn't sure where I was looking. ""So, you're looking through the tiny hole in the barrier?"" 

""Mmmhmm."" He chuckled. ""Curse my 20/20 vision. I wanted to get an idea of what normal life is like, and I get hit in the face with burgers. I want Five Guys so bad. I would kill for one."" I could hear him adjusting the dial on the talkie. 

""Did you know some people, desperate enough, would kill for takeout?""

There was a pause, and I heard his slight intake of breath, his shuffling crackling into interference.

I didn't even have to reply. Jude never stopped talking.

""Don't you think this is… kinda cool? Apart from the whole, uh, end of the world, dystopian, only our town thing.""

I could see my breath dancing in front of me and zipped up my jacket, responding in a gasp, ""Freezing our asses off waiting for mediocre meals?""

""No. Like, what we're doing. I feel like I'm keeping watch for the undead while my friends, the last survivors of humanity, sleep."" Jude snorted. ""Instead, I'm a glorified UberEats delivery guy for a community of kids.""

""You enjoy it though,"" I said through a yawn, rubbing my hands together. 

The early November chill was already seeping into my bones. 

He responded in a hum. ""It's aight.""

Jude sighed, leaving us both in a peaceful silence. 

""How did you get on the barrier, Ria?"" 

His question took me off guard, an ice cold shiver ripping down my spine. 

""What?"" 

""Well, I have Ben to give me a hand to climb up. Even if he sleeps all the way through his shift, his bulky legs make up for it. But you? You're alone, so how exactly are you getting up there?"" 

He paused, and the shriek of feedback sent me jolting, immediately losing my concentration. Jude laughed, and I couldn't resist twisting around, scanning the empty road behind me. 

No sign of any life. 

My radio crackled, and I jumped for the first time in a while. 

""Wait, wait, wait,"" Jude's tone had significantly darkened. ""So, you're telling me *you* managed to scale a barrier this high with zero help?"" 

For a moment, my tongue was tangled. ""I stand on crates,"" I said, ""Obviously.""

Jude hummed. ""Sounds like bullshit, Ria.”

I tightened my grip on my talkie, fingering the off switch. ""Why do you care?"" 

""Oh, I don't,"" He chuckled. ""I'm just curious how you learned how to climb this high.""

The silence that followed twisted my gut into knots. I could just hear Jude's breathing, and, if I really listened out for it, the late evening traffic coming through the town over the barrier. 

Jude surprised me with a laugh. ""I'm just messin' with ya, Ria. The night shift goes to my head, y'know? I gotta find new ways of bantering wi' ya.""

""Sure,"" I said, but my chest was clenching. 

""Ooh, shit. I think my delivery is here. I gotta go before they spot me on the barrier,"" he panted. ""Uh, over and out! Or whatever you're supposed to say–"" 

Switching off the talkie and cutting off his  farewell, a fresh slither crept down my spine. 

My delivery came soon after.

5000 MRE's. 

I tore into the first one, unable to help myself. But Jude's words were still in my mind, making me paranoid. Paranoia made me desperate. Being desperate made me remember how hungry I was. 

I was stuffing handfuls of cold rice and chicken into my mouth when the sour-faced man helping me unload the shipment cleared his throat. 

""You're supposed to microwave it, sweetheart.""

I ignored him. ""Is this it?"" I said through a mouthful of mush. Mush had never tasted so fucking good. ""No snacks?"" 

He threw me a crushed Milky Way, making sure to keep his distance. 

""There's a snack. Knock yourself out.""

After spending all night delivering MRE'S to locked doors that were normally open and welcoming, I finally reached home with three ready to eat. 

I had picked the best ones for my family. Chilli for Nathaniel, chicken and noodles for Sera, and fried rice for me. 

When I opened the door, I was greeted to soft snores, my little sister sleeping on the couch, and Nathaniel wrapped up in a blanket on the floor. 

I pulled my food out of the package, threw it in the microwave, and then collapsed on the floor next to my brother. 

I was so tired. 

So fucking tired, I could barely move my legs. 

What did Jude say again? 

*How exactly did you get onto the barrier, Ria?*

The microwave dinging didn't wake me up. The stink of burning plastic and cremated food did. 

""Get up."" The voice was familiar, pulling me out of my thoughts. When I didn't move, someone kicked me violently in the stomach, and something was dropped onto my head. 

I sat up, a scream clawing in my throat, the burned remnants of my dinner dripping down my face. Standing over me were two pairs of feet, and when I looked up, I glimpsed Gracie Lockhart. 

She made sense, she was a psycho. 

But not Liam, our mayor, who was supposed to be sane. 

""Get up!"" This time, I was kicked in the head. I felt my brain bounce around my skull, my vision blurring. 

I was on my feet, off balance. All around me was a startling orange. I thought it was from the microwave catching fire, but then the blurred orange was moving. 

Gracie, Liam, and two other guys held flaming torches. 

The light was mesmerizing. 

I found myself transfixed, until I snapped out of it. Nathaniel was in front of me, his arms bound behind his back. 

A squeaking, muffling Sera was struggling in between two girls' grasp.

I found my voice. ""What… what's going on?"" 

My arms were violently pinned behind my back. When I twisted around, I found myself eye to eye with my best friend. 

Jude wore a hooded sweatshirt, his curls hidden underneath. 

He didn’t meet my gaze, shoving me toward the door along with the others.

""Witch,"" Gracie spat in my face before yanking me out of our house and throwing me to my knees. 

I tried to lift my head, but Gracie stomped on my back, and I bit back a shriek. 

Nathaniel and Sera were thrown down next to me, and I stared at the reflection in my brother’s eyes, following the orange glow that lit up the darkness. 

In front of us, a horde of kids stood, all holding torches burning bright.

""We’ve found them!"" Gracie cried to the crowd, and they cheered, a psychotic hive mind thirsty for our blood.

""We have FOUND the evil who did this to our parents! Who trapped us!""

She had to be kidding, right?

Nathaniel shook his head, eyes wide. ""What? You’re fucking serious?!""

Gracie crouched in front of us and held up her phone. Her ""evidence"" was a screenshot of a tweet posted the same day the adults exploded. It read only: 

""The Sinclairs are witches."" Posted from an account with zero followers, zero likes, and a default profile picture.

Panic crept into my gut.

The town was already losing their minds from isolation and starvation.

Could they really believe we had started this?

""Jude,"" I found my voice, a sharp squeak I didn't trust. 

When Gracie screamed, *blood for blood!* And forced me to my feet by my hair, I caught his eye in the crowd. 

""Jude, I'm not a fucking witch!""

""You killed my mum,"" he said in a whisper, a demented laugh slipping through his lips. ""She was all over me, and I couldn't breathe. Her blood was stuck to me. She was everywhere, Ria.""

""You know me,"" I managed to cry out. ""Jude, you know this is bullshit!"" 

He didn't reply, his expression hardening. I wish I could have seen a glitter of influence in his eyes. 

But it was all him.

Jude's fear had turned him into a monster. 

""Burn the witch,"" he said in a whimper, his lip curling. 

The boy's expression contorted, his hiss became a yell, cutting through the crowd's screams. ""Fucking burn them!""

""Burn them!"" The crowd hollered. 

I stopped fighting when we were dragged through town, rotten food and soiled diapers thrown in our faces. 

I knew where we were headed, and my body had gone numb. 

Nathaniel stayed still, silent, his dark eyes finding his friends in the crowd. 

Sera screamed, sobbing, begging to a group of kids who already decided her fate. 

It was Jude who shoved me against our founder tree, binding me to my siblings.

It was Jude who stepped back, gripping his torch for dear life. 

They surrounded us, a ring of blazing fire and expressions riddled with excitement. Gracie stepped forward, Liam by her side. 

I knew in her fucked up little mind, killing us would bring back the adults. 

And she had spread the word, like a virus, polluting the town's minds.

""Ria Sinclair,"" she stepped in front of me. 

Then the others. 

""Nathaniel Sinclair."" 

She was gentle with my sister, forcing Sera's head up with the tip of her manicure. 

""And Sera Sinclair.""

""We find you guilty of Witchcraft,"" she said. ""Your sentence is burning in the pits of hell where you belong."" 

I didn't take her seriously, not even with a burning torch in her grasp, until the girl pulled out a knife from her pocket. 

I turned my attention to the sky when the blade was drawn across my sobbing sister's throat. 

When her cries gurgled and deep, dark red spotted the earth, I looked at the moon poking from the clouds instead. 

I didn't see my sister die. 

I just saw her body slump over, her head of dark brown curls hanging in her face. 

The crowd's reaction was haunting, calls for my sister's head to be severed and waved in the air in triumph. 

I kept my gaze on the sky, tears filling my eyes. 

""Nate."" I managed to get out.

*She's dead*, I wanted to scream. 

*Our sister is dead.*

""Nate!"" I screamed. 

He didn't reply, even when Gracie knelt in front of him and dragged the blade of the knife down his cheek and forcing him to look at her with the tip of her nail. 

""You're a fucking murderer,"" he said in a whimper, only for her to spit in his face.

Nathaniel didn't blink, struggling in his restraints. 

""Witch,"" Gracie Lockhart snarled at him, pressing the knife deeper. ""You're a filthy witch, Nathaniel Sinclair.""

I don't know what sealed the deal. 

Was it Gracie parading my sister's body in front of him, or spitting in his face? 

I could feel it already, icy prickles creeping down my bare arms, already playing with strands of my hair. 

When I twisted my head, Nathaniel was smiling. I saw the contortion in his cheeks, amusement morphing into agony, unnatural darkness spider-webbing across his pupils. 

Velvet magic.

He stunk of it. 

I fucking *knew* the asshole was using it! 

Velvet magic, also known as possession magic, had been banned a long time ago. 

It is to witches, what drugs are to humans. Addictive. Drawn from dark energy that humans naturally make, it is well known to take over the mind and soul of the witch possessing it. 

If my brother had been using Velvet magic, he was doing so with purpose. 

I was too, but I was… inexperienced. Just like my mother said that morning. Only when I turned eighteen, would I be able to experiment with possession magic. 

I have a confession. 

What I wrote at the start wasn't the complete truth. 

Yes, I did scream at my mother. 

How was I supposed to know *fuck off and die* would actually work?

And more so, how would I know it would take out half of the fucking town?

Nathaniel was our family witch. 

Why was he using velvet magic in the first place? 

I had secretly been tearing myself apart for a year over my magic being the cause of our town-wide disaster. 

Was I wrong?  

Did *he* kill the adults? 

I should have been horrified when Gracie's brains started to leak out of her ears. 

Except she murdered my sister, and had bound me to a tree. 

Led a 'government' that assaulted my brother. 

The girl squeaked, slamming her hand over her mouth, smearing red dripping down her face. 

""Nate,"" I shot him a look.

But I don't think he saw it. Nathaniel just saw our little sister's dead body. 

I lost my breath when, with a single flick of his finger behind his back, Gracie's head was splitting apart, her delighted grin twisting into horror. 

She didn't even get to feel it; a mercy I knew the bitch didn't deserve. When a chunk of the girl's skull landed on the ground, lips still split into a grotesque skeletal grin, the crowd went silent.

Before...

Screams. 

Gracie's body hit the ground, and then caught alight, flames dancing across her skin. 

Without a word, Nathaniel calmly pulled apart his restraints, and with a single jerk of his wrist, an agonising scream escaping his lips, his eyes filled with black, sent the crowd flying several feet. 

I watched kids thrown back, helpless dolls caught in an invisible wind. 

One boy slammed into a tree, his body crumpling, a girl bisected on a wire fence. 

I didn't realize how powerful my brother really was. 

I should have cared about them, cared that they were dying. Hurting. 

But. 

They had murdered my fucking sister. 

When Nate dropped his hands, his gaze found mine and he opened his mouth. 

But his words were drowned out by mechanical shrieking from above us. 

Looking up, a helicopter was hovering, and I remembered my Mom's words. 

*Do not draw attention to yourselves, do you hear me?*

Her words echoed in my mind, when another helicopter appeared. 

*There are bad people, Ria. Bad witches looking for us. And if they find us, they'll kill us. Our entire coven in this town. They'll burn it to the ground.*

Nathaniel ignored the presence in the sky, wrapping his arms around me, squeezing me into a hug. The darkness in his eyes, spider webbing across his face, was something else. Velvet magic. He was consumed by it, drowning darkness.

But I didn't… hate it.

If he was going to avenge Sera, then so be it. 

""One thousand five hundred."" Nate whispered into my shoulder before pulling away, his breaths heavy. 

""One thousand five hundred."" His voice contorted into a giggle which wasn't my brother's. Mom taught us about possession magic. It converts witches, filling their minds with Dark influence. 

But I wanted it to fill him. 

If he was going to save our sister. 

""Blood for blood.""

Before I  could respond, rough hands were on my bindings, tugging them apart. ""Come on,"" a voice hissed out. 

But I was watching my brother scoop Sera's body into his arms. 

""Are you stupid? Do you really want to hang around and let yourself be caught?""

I was dizzy, dragged by a shadow I fought against. But I was too weak, my magic rolling right off of him. 

""They're rounding up witches, idiot!"" the shadow's voice bled into one I knew. 

Jude.

Immediately, I twisted around, aiming a kick to his face which he easily dodged, grabbing my shoulders. 

I glimpsed that exact same flicker of darkness in his eyes. Velvet magic. 

The asshole was one of us, hiding in plain sight, and didn't save my sister. 

In fact, the bastard *watched*. 

He dragged me back, pulling me into a clearing when the crowd started screaming, this time led by Liam. 

Nathaniel had killed at least ten kids. 

When I risked a look, my brother was carrying my sister away, unfazed by the yells from above telling him to stay where he was. 

When sparks of dazzling purple hit the ground like fireworks, I realized the people shooting at us were not *human.*

Witches. 

Jude's lips latched to my ear, his breath ice cold. 

""Your *idiot* brother just gave them a reason to start hunting us down, and the Sinclairs are at the top of their list. So if *I* were you?"" He spoke through gritted teeth.

I was running late for work, juggling a bagel in one hand, my phone in the other, and somehow a full cup of coffee with my elbow. Don't ask me how. I thought I was being efficient. I was wrong.



As I attempted to unlock my car with my face (thank you, Face ID), the coffee took its chance. One rebellious jerk of the elbow and SPLASH it launched itself directly into my open bag like a caffeine-seeking missile. Inside that bag? Laptop, planner, one single dry-clean-only shirt, and approximately 27 loose receipts.



Panicking, I yanked everything out and stood in the driveway holding a soggy laptop like it was a drowning hamster. My neighbor watched from her porch, sipping tea like it was a telenovela. “Rough morning?” she asked. “I’m fine,” I lied, holding back tears and caffeine-scented rage.



I showed up to work an hour late, shirt stained, laptop dead, bagel uneaten, and dignity lost. My boss just looked at me and said, “You look like you fought a barista and lost.”

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Physical and verbal abuse, mental health crises!<

**MOOD SPOILER:** >!Dark and stressful!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/JzSTLoae8H)  **July 14, 2024**

Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile and I’m really shaken up as I write this.
My (30F) spouse (35M) has been experiencing behaviour that has only become increasingly concerning. In the past two months now, he has been talking about things that he claims are happening but he’s never mentioned before.

As some background info, when his behaviour first starting getting concerning, I managed to convince him to go the hospital to get checked out for his mental health. He wasn’t even seen by a doctor and he was told he just needs to take a certain medicine to help him sleep. The issue is he also smokes weed so this medicine does not mix well with that. He won’t quit smoking. We also have two very young kids.

Back to the weird recent behaviour, he claims he had an old email with an inheritance that got hacked and he needs access to it. I tried helping him get on it but he hasn’t used it in literally the 12 years we’ve been together, I only knew of its existence previously when I helped him switch his Facebook login and that was an email attached. Another example is that he believes everyone is talking about him to me and everyone else, I mean literally everyone else. He thinks there’s some sort big thing planned to hurt him or do something horrible to him soon and that we’re all on it.

On a few other separate occasions he’s asked about a “show” that “we’re on” and asked how much money I’m being paid to keep a secret. He also thinks I’m having secret phone calls and that I’ve apparently left the room to accept these calls, which then results in me coming back crying about something I’ve apparently discussed on the phone.


Whenever I try to explain to him that none of this is happening, he fights back saying that I’m just lying to him and to tell him the truth. That I need to tell him the truth or something bad is going to happen.

It’s gotten so bad, he ended up getting fired from his job because he was barely showing up. He kept going to the cop station to make a report instead of going to work. After he got fired there was some sort of tense situation where they ended up calling a wellness check for him, because they were afraid he’s going to come back and hurt someone. The cops showed up while I was also home and he said he wouldn’t hurt someone, he only acts in defense.


In the recent weeks, he’s gone from screaming at me demanding answers to just not talking to me at all. At this point I’d rather he just not interact with me.

The reason I’m writing this is because of what happened today. It was a nice day out and I asked if he would come with me for a walk with our kids, to which he agreed to. He barely spoke a word to me or the kids on this walk, and when we came across a playground, I asked if we should take the kids there for a few minutes of play. He then got upset at me for suggesting it and said I always control everything and I’m the “queen of the decisions”. I didn’t even tell him we were doing that, I just asked. When I mentioned this he just said “do whatever you want, like always”, so I figured why not. So I played with the kids at the playground and he did his own thing. Someone left a couple various balls there and he was throwing them around. He then picked up the football and threw it in my direction, it flew past me a couple feet from me. I asked why he did that and he said “why are you upset, it didn’t hit you” to which I responded “well what if it did?” He then said “if I wanted it to hit you in the head I would have thrown it that way”. Then he started on a rant about how he’s going through the same thing with everyone lying to him. After which he sat down in the corner of the park and was doing literally nothing.

I was getting upset, so I packed up the kids and started walking to leave the park. I said to him “we’re going home” and started walking away. Apparently he tried to yell out to us but ended up taking a different way home than we did. He told me this when he met me on the street when we were almost home, saying that “next time I want to be an idiot and walk away maybe stop and listen for him calling out”. I didn’t hear him but honestly he could have easily caught up to us.

I was getting more and more upset and said I wanted to go for a drive to get coffee and he said fine. I said I wanted to take the kids and he asked why. Then I said fine, you stay home with them and he said no they can go with you and started putting them in the car. I got in the car, and he got in the passenger seat, to which I asked him if he’s coming with. He said yes and to drive. I told him I didn’t want him coming with because he’s being mean and he said he could be a lot meaner. As I started driving away he kept going off on the usual BS he’s been talking about lately and I told him I don’t want to hear it, he started screaming at me to keep driving and shut the fuck up. I stopped the car and told him to get out and he made a motion like he was going to punch me but punched his hand in front of my face. At this point I started crying and yelling at him to get out and he yelled back no just drive. I then said I should just drive him to the police station for that and he said he would choke me unconscious before we even got there. I was crying even more at this point and said I don’t want to be with him anymore and I want him out, he said no. He continued to be a dick for the rest of the car ride, where I pleaded with him to not treat me this way, especially in front of our children. It’s not fair to them, or to me. He said to not bring them into this. I said how couldn’t I, they are literally in the car!

Anyway after I drove us home, he asked how long I’ve been waiting to break up with him and who I’m replacing him with. I told him I haven’t been and there’s no one else, which of course he doesn’t believe. When he got inside he even taunted me saying “I should take you to the cop station” in a girly voice.

He’s outside smoking and I’m inside with the kids writing this. Of course I’m shook up currently but I don’t know what to do. We only have the one vehicle which is in both our names, the place we rent is actually my moms so we don’t have a lease but we both have our addresses attached to this place on our licenses. He wasn’t always like this, literally only the past couple months his behaviour has been this bad. I miss the person he used to be, I miss that he would spend time with me, with the kids, but he spends all his time by himself now. I don’t know if he’s going through some sort of manic episode or what’s triggering this change in behaviour but I really don’t know what to do.

Is there something differently I can do to help him? Every time he talks to me about whatever “situation” he doesn’t accept any answer I say and also won’t accept if I say nothing.

EDIT: I just wanted to update and let you all know we are safe. I’m sorry for not saying anything sooner. I’m a bit overwhelmed with how popular this post got and will give an actual update later.

Thank you for the advice and comments as well. I will mention a couple things —

* we are not in the US

* where we are, marijuana is legal, so my spouse does get it from government run dispensaries. I don’t think there’s a chance his stuff gets laced aside from the fact he mixes cigarettes with it.

* a lot of people mentioned meth. There is just no way. He doesn’t go anywhere random, he doesn’t talk to people outside of our household (aside from the few times he would go to the police station). I have his location on his phone so I can see where he goes when he leaves.

> Wow this is way more urgent than everyone seems to be acting. Are you able to sneak yourself and your kids out right now while he's smoking? You could start by going to the police station and telling them what's going on, they should hopefully be able to connect you to resources for families fleeing domestic abuse. If you have someone you can stay with, then that makes it easier but either way do not spend another night in that house with him and definitely don't let your kids around him unsupervised. 
>
> If you can't sneak out I would call 911, tell them what just happened and about his threats, and that you need to get out but that you are afraid for you and your children's safety. They are not always the most helpful but something needs to happen. At least then if he comes back in and tries to do something to you you'll be in the phone with them and they can send someone then. Might be a good strategy while your leaving too if you're worried he might catch you. 
>
> It sounds like he's having some kind of psychological break, the paranoia and being convinced everyone is part of some conspiracy against him is not abnormal there. But he has clearly told you that he is a danger to you so you need to worry about that first, get yourself and your kids to safety and figure the rest out after that. Once it's time to deal with him and his situation, depending on where you are, getting him involuntarily detained for psychiatric treatment requires proving he's a danger to himself or others, so at least you can show how he's threatened you. But worry about that after you and your kids are safely away from him.

> Heavy cannabis use can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in people who are already susceptible. Your H is right about the age where this tends to happen in men. I am not a doctor but I really think this is a mental health emergency, either due to a drug interaction, drug use itself, or because he is rapidly developing a psychotic disorder.
>
> You need to see a mental health professional, NOT the ER, and describe all of this behavior to them including the frequency of his marijuana use.

**OOP**

>>That’s the thing, he saw a crisis nurse at the hospital and a therapist/social worker there, and I felt like the only thing they tried to do was get him to take a specific medication. I think it’s called quetiapine or something. But anyway, I don’t think he is regularly taking it and if he is he definitely shouldn’t be mixing it with smoking weed.

**daddy_tywin**

>>>That’s the generic for seroquel, which is actually an antipsychotic medication used for schizophrenia and bipolar I episodes. That makes way more sense to be prescribed than a sleeping pill. You’re right though he needs to be taking it as RX’d (bottle should have the dosing on it). I looked up the drug interactions and the ones listed are moderate and mostly physical although generally people with any kind of psychotic disorder I think are not supposed to use marijuana.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/MN8Dx4Qt8L) **July 20, 2024 (6 days later)**

Hello, first of all thank you all for the comments, messages, etc. on my previous post. Obviously it got a bit too much to keep up with responding but I just want to say I really appreciate the help. A TL;DR at the bottom.


To give an update, I left the house the night I made the post, but went back home the following day. I wanted to be able to collect some sort of evidence I could use, because my spouse has been really good at downplaying his symptoms to any authority figure. I want to mention that I had been present at most doctor and hospital visits prior, so I know what they did recommend for him. I felt at the time that they did not give him enough help for the crisis he was obviously going through.

Anyway, continuing on, the couple days after the Sunday post, he did not really engage in much conversation with me or our children. Every time he entered the room, I set my phone to record. I did not get anything until Thursday, when he finally started talking to me again. He was questioning who I have been talking to about him and who has been trying to sabotage his life. Obviously I denied everything, because there is no one talking to me about him (aside from this Reddit post, which he didn’t know about). This started to anger him, which included him yelling at me and saying if anyone is talking to me about him, to bring him to the house so he can “take care of them himself”.

I tried to not to engage any more. This made him more upset, as he was continuing to demand answers from me. He would then say “oh I want to hit you” or “don’t make me slap you” when I was either not answering or just saying I didn’t know what he was talking about. I got this on recording. After he ended up walking away and leaving the room, I took the kids to bed, locked us in our room and tried to sleep.

The following morning, he insisted on driving me to work. I told him I wanted the car, to which he disagreed with me and said he needed it. After dropping out kids off, he started going off on me about how I am stupidity, dumb, a bitch, etc. for keeping his “inheritance” (again something he is clearly having delusions about) from him. I tried to disengage completely, keeping myself to far side of the passenger seat, which caused him to grab me by the back of my neck and pull me closer to him, where he told me to listen to him. I obviously reacted to this and was super upset, telling him to please focus on driving and not touch me again.

After he drove me to work, the last thing I said to him as he was still going off on me with the car window open, was “you desperately need help”. Once I got in, I called my boss and let her know what happened. She came in, cancelled her appointments for the day, and took me to the police station.

We made a report, although the sergeant we initially spoke to seemed to be against us making a report (he kept saying he will be homeless if I report him, like he’s the victim in this scenario). I told him my safety and the kids safety should be more important, and he brought in a different officer to make the statement with me. Once I completed that statement, they let me know to stay away from the house as they were going to arrest him, and will call once he’s out of the house.

About 5 hours later, he was arrested. Apparently he was very compliant, and with all the information I provided, they actually took him to the hospital, and he is currently on a 30 day psychiatric hold. He will be going to court at some point for uttering threats and assault, but seeing how he doesn’t have a criminal record, I’m sure it will just end up being a slap on the wrist.

So as of now, I am home, safe with the children, and we are getting our locks changed. I will also most likely get a protection order, but in an ideal world, he gets better and that’s not necessary. I guess we will see in the future.
I want to again thank every one for their comments and assistance. A lot of you made some excellent points, and although I know some of my decisions probably seemed like dumb ones, I was trying to figure out the best solution logistically for us. Any other future updates will be on my profile.

TL;DR: he was arrested yesterday and put on a psych hold. I’m okay physically but not emotionally.

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/u/Top_Manufacturer_620/s/K4F9n0fZ2j)  **Nov 21, 2024 (4 months later)**

I don’t know if anyone will even see this.

It’s been awhile since I updated. I still get messages asking how I am and to update again. I apologize in the delay, but I’ve been a bit deterred from making another post due to coming across a TikTok video of one of those AI voices reading my post over a Minecraft video. If one of those channels decides to post this one, please don’t. But if you do anyway, blah blah blah blah blah, we can’t make our own unique content.

Anyway, onto the actual update:

My spouse is doing a lot better. He received the treatment he needed in the psych ward of the hospital, gets a shot every so often instead of taking pills, and only smokes cigarettes now. He’s back to his normal self, engages in conversation with myself and our children like he did before this crazy shit happened, has a job, and honestly, is being a better partner overall. It took a lot of time for me to feel like I could trust him again, but we’ve taken a lot of time to work on things and get back to how we should be.

I know a lot of people wanted me to leave and never look back. But you have to realize how he acted in my initial post was nothing like how he is as a person. Obviously he had some sort of weird psychosis happening, which could have been a result of a high intake of marijuana, plus a couple added stressors. I don’t want to go into too many details because it will give away where we are, but basically something traumatic happened under 10 years ago that happened again a month before he started acting strange. It was one of those types of events that forces you out of your home for undetermined amount of time. Anyway, that’s all the detail I want to go into that. Obviously he was affected by it more than I thought, because when this event happened, I was the one having a difficult time and he was my rock. But after we were able to go back home and have some normalcy, that’s when things started changing for him.

It started with him randomly needing to gain access into an old email, to thinking he was being recorded all the time like he was on the Truman show or something, to thinking that everyone (including me) was out to get him. This is when the threats of violence started happening.

I was obviously in disbelief because in the entire time we’ve been together, nothing like this has ever happened. I never once felt like I was unsafe. I never felt scared. Until the threats continued to come, and he started to escalate.

After he made excellent progress in the hospital and I had many reassuring conversations with the psychiatrist, I allowed him to come home when he was discharged. It was so hard not having him around, I cried all the time, our kids really missed their dad, and he really missed us. He needed to get help, and I’m so thankful I was able to find an effective solution.

This will most likely be my last update. I don’t really think I’ll need to add any other details, but again, I just want to thank everyone for their messages and comments, even the ones who called me an idiot lol.

**NEW UPDATE**

[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/u/Top_Manufacturer_620/s/j3jktuEkTY)  **Sept 20, 2025 (10 months after last update)**

Another update

Hello all,

It’s been almost a year since my last update. To keep things short, shit hit the fan this year. He didn’t take the medications he was supposed to, reverted into another major psychosis episode which ended in him attempting to strangle me after I disputed his delusions. He was removed from the home and there’s a protective order against him for myself and the kids. This happened earlier this year. My kids and I are safe, and haven’t heard from him since. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t trust that someone will get better or attempt to work on their horrible mental health when they haven’t proven to be reliable in other parts in their life. Don’t try to fix someone who can’t be fixed, or rather, just don’t try to fix people. 

Thanks everyone for their comments, whether they were good or bad. Shout out to BORU community that will eat me alive after reading my update.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I have created a wesbite called [Next Is On Me](https://nextisonme.com/) where people can create and join casual social events (like grabbing a drink, coffee, or hanging out).

The core philosophy is that Event-Creator pays for the event, (drinks, food, etc) and selects the participant(s), from the list of people applied for it.

Right now, I’ve made it for big cities-only for the first testing phase.

It’s very much an **MVP** but we are still improving things and adding extra features.

If you’re curious, we would appreciate if you could take a look and let us know of your feedback about the website and the idea in general (you can comment here, send me a pm or leave feedback on the website from the bottom right button)

Basically if I could only take one pair of shoes these would be it.


My only dilemma is them being GTX - normally I’d choose non-gtx but for that price they seem a steal.

* Birthday: May26
* Age: 23
* Gender: Male
* Sexuality: Straight
* Height: 186 cm (6'2"")
* Weight: 78 kg (159 lb)
* General complexity: Muscled (decathlonist build), heavily tanned
* Distinguishing appearance features: Bunny ears, female morph
* Blood type: AB+
* Hair: Dark orange, long
* Eye colour: Grey
* Personality traits: Willful, condescending, empathetic, organized, idealistic, rigid, patriotic
* Quirk: Gestation (India Xray). Zoran\`s Quirk Factor exists in a state of highly mutable flux, allowing for controlled recombination. As a result, he can essentially generate a custom-made Quirk, to wield one at a time. The generation process is highly energy-intensive as Quirk Factor rapidly cycles through variations, and is accompanied by raised temperature and itching sensation. However, Zoran can ""remember"" achieved configurations to recall later, which takes only miniscule fraction of strain and time. Furthermore, the process of generation can be both intuitively directed, and extended past its initial conclusion to evolve resulting Quirk further as if through months and years of intense practice.
* Place of birth: Budva, Crna Gora
* Aspirations: To cover his fridge with souvenir magnets from every country, to uplift humanity, to learn lucid dreaming (the blasphemer), to release his own brand of coffee
* Likes: Honey, cold weather, modern idiophone music
* Dislikes: Water, selfishness, displays of affection
* Costume: Lab coat with artistic splotches of various colours over a monochrome(which colour varies over days) T-shirt and black jeans, empty glasses rim. Typically Zoran also keeps a match in the corner of his mouth to periodically chew on.
* Yearbook Quote: ""And we dont know which way the sky will turn""

Zoran is the univocally praised Number One Hero of Crna Gora (big news here), keeping the spot for over a decade - after finishing high school at eleven and completing hero studies within a year after that (all with assistance of his Quirk, particularly Perfect Memorization configuration).

He mostly spends his time doing benevolent work: healing, scientific assistance, producing ex-nihilo food and materials, building houses and such; crime-hunting could be called least of his concerns. But oh, OH, when he does get to that... He has a whole array of Quirk configurations that can exclusively be summed up as ""crimes against humanity"". His ""Acute Neurodivergence Blast"" achieved local meme status, to give an example, to the point you would think its his most used move (instead of clocking by the end of list, only ahead of genuine one-off experiments).

Despite his excessively antagonistic approach to crime and patriotism seemingly being perfect breeding grounds for a revolting ""government lapdog"" personality, he feels a notable *and open* affinity towards folks opposing authority.",0,1759007928.0,BNHA_OC_Characters,0,0.5,False

But no. As luck would have it, my dreams are of he who should not be named. Our Lord Voldemort as he shall be known forthwith seeing that I can neither say his name nor mention my thoughts on him. 

And I wish I could tell him so,
Tell him that when I am away from his space for a day or two, he should just call.

He nibbles and licks, telling me all those little kinky thoughts he has when I'm doing a presentation, how he likes it when I lick my lips coz I'm nervous and  he knows I'm about to spill some bullshit when I touch the nape of my neck.

In these dreams, he gets to look deeply into my eyes like he never can and tells me how lovely brown they are, in them he reads everything I can't say and yet still asks me what I do want.

In our dream  he thinks I'm funny, falling over at my jokes and adores my quirky self.

 In here he doesn't have to perform for anyone else but me. His mask is off and I can see him...

He lets his metaphoric hair down and stays loose, his shirt unbuttoned, his swimmer chest a  feast for my eyes and he doesn't mind.

Here we take our time...we talk softly about how much he moves me when he strides around every few minutes...compare our ADHD notes wonder at each other's weirdities.

I get to do more than just stare at his hands and he gets to put them to some good use.

I see why he only visits in dreamland.. for here we have no wives, no husbands to consider,no HR regulations to think about and the only insubordination we have to worry about is when he whispers commands into my ear and I'm too far gone to adhere.

I like these dreams too... For then our walls are down and I get to experience him in his full presence nothing barred by expectation;

we can be anywhere we wish..

1ns6iqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ns6iqc/never_forget_how_starbuck_ruined_coffee/,NEVER FORGET HOW STARBUCK RUINED COFFEE,"Coffee used to be f-ing simple. You walked into a café, you ordered a god\*\*\*\* cup of coffee, and you went about your day. No bulls\*\*\*, no unnecessary frills, just a hot, strong cup of liquid motivation. But then Starbucks happened. And let me tell you, that overhyped caffeine cult didn’t just change how people drink coffee; it ruined it. 

Back in the day, a coffee shop wasn’t some f-ing lifestyle brand. It was just a place where you grabbed a decent cup of joe. But then Starbucks swooped in during the 90s and said, Oh no, coffee isn’t just a drink, it’s an identity! It’s a god\*\*\*\* statement about who you are as a person! They took something simple and turned it into a spectacle. Suddenly, everyone needed their coffee to be an experience, a ritual of customization, personalization, and ridiculous add-ons that made a basic cup of coffee feel like a f-ing science experiment. Non-fat, half-caf, extra caramel, two pumps of vanilla, oat milk, shaken, stirred, upside down, what the actual f--- happened to just drinking coffee?

And of course, as Starbucks expanded, every other coffee shop had to either keep up or die. They couldn’t compete with Starbucks’ empire, so they did the next worst thing: they copied it. Every café started offering the same overpriced, sugar-filled bulls\*\*\* just to stay in business. Gone were the days of just getting a normal cup of coffee without being bombarded by a wall of overpriced, diabetes-inducing monstrosities. Now, every god\*\*\*\* place looks the same, sells the same s\*\*\*, and charges you five to seven bucks for something that barely even tastes like coffee anymore.

And here’s where it pisses me off personally. Sometimes, I don’t want a f-ing caramel drizzle soy foam cold brew with a name longer than a god\*\*\*\* novel. I just want coffee. Plain. Hot. No nonsense. But instead, I’m standing in line behind some influencer-in-training ordering a drink that sounds like a f-ing dessert menu threw up on itself. I finally get to order, and what do I see? A five-dollar price tag for a small, weak-ass cup that tastes like burnt regret because coffee shops have forgotten how to make a normal, strong brew.

I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t ask for coffee to become a f-ing fashion statement. I didn’t ask for every café to become a clone of Starbucks’ soulless, overpriced empire. But here we are, paying premium prices just to get less coffee and more bulls\*\*\*. And you know what? I’m f-ing tired of it",0,1759007604.0,rant,29,0.47,False

I also enjoy voice and video calls so it's a plus if you're into those too!

Who are you? If you are kind, also open-minded, and are also looking for something consistent, you're the gal for me. I don't care where in the world you are and time zones don't bother me!

Quiz: What profession lets you work not only from home, but from bed?

The practice is known in some parts as “Prousting”. Marcel spent 14 years writing In Search of Lost Time, in bed. He suffered from asthma and allergies and transformed his bedroom by lining the walls and ceiling with cork to create a cave of seclusion. The aim: to entirely eliminate pesky intrusions like dust and noise, so he could write in thick silence.

Marcel Proust spent 14 years writing In Search of Lost Time, in bed.

Edith Wharton wrote in bed with a dog tucked under an arm (must try). James Joyce sometimes lay on his stomach in bed, wearing a white coat, while using large blue crayons. W.G. Sebald had back pain and would also lie on his stomach in bed, his head propped on a chair and his manuscript on the floor. William Faulkner’s bedroom was more an office, with bed, and his walls came in handy for outlining plots (must not try).

George Orwell had TB while writing 1984 and often wrote in bed with a cigarette in hand. Edith Sitwell declared: “All women should have a day a week in bed.” Just one? Truman Capote said: “I’m a completely horizontal author. I can’t think unless I’m lying down, either in bed or stretched on a couch and with a cigarette and coffee handy. I’ve got to be puffing and sipping.” Hugh Hefner edited in bed. Plus it revolved. Imagine. Actually don’t, for there are pictures to be Googled of this supine tech hub. Joyce Carol Oates recently tweeted: “(Cormac) McCarthy typed his manuscripts in bed propped up by pillows, as an invalid might do. All those thousands of pages! Could not have been good for his back, posture.” Well, yes (sits up smartly, in guilt).

George Orwell had TB while writing 1984 and often wrote in bed with a cigarette in hand.

But the bliss of this work space. There’s a moment after bed is climbed into, after the hurly burly of weekday kid-wrangling, where I exhale into words with animals congregating in the quiet. It’s a sanctuary of a space that’s a temple of unfurling thought, surrounded by books and notepads with a screen of beautiful green beyond the windows, and in the roof a Perspex eye to the sky. There’s an intimacy to this kind of writing, which I suspect informs the writer’s voice. As a practitioner of bed-writing, you’re trapped; held and spelled by the comfort of the work space.

There are many cons to this writing gig. We earn, on average, a measly $18,200 a year. It’s a world of rejection, even when you think you’ve made it. Our readership is precipitously declining, lured away by screens amid fracturing attention spans. The great dragon of AI is roaring upon us, and un-empathetic tech bros thieve our livelihood. We’re hammered by insecurity and doubt. Our foremost literary magazines are being shuttered by cruel and short-sighted institutions (note the tragedy of Meanjin and Melbourne University Publishing), and some festivals cower in fear of the Writer Unleashed and boss us into signing draconian agreements; treating us like children they can’t quite trust.

But we do get to write in bed, if it’s desired. A delicious perk of the job. And The Chap has just appeared, chasing a tie, and I’ve informed him I’m writing a column on writing in bed. A look. A sigh. He disappears then reappears, handing across a hidden box of chocolates that I had, miraculously, not yet sniffed out. Nor had any Tin Lid. They’re at school. And I’m now alone, in bed, with clandestine contraband and laptop. Sometimes, actually, this really is the best job in the world. Apologies.

Four pillows, tray table, laptop, furry hot water bottle resting her paw on my ankle, dog on the floor next to us and a mattress doing absolutely nothing in terms of posture. This is bliss.

1ns69dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ns69dv/how_to_handle_friend_turned_horrible_boss/,How to handle friend turned horrible boss?,"This is long but I need some advice. I'm in healthcare and I've been at my job for 8 years now. I very much love a part of it, which is what keeps me there. I get excellent reviews each year and have a great relationship with the consulting team I work with and most of our office.

I was very close with one of my coworkers, Sarah, for the first 5 years of my job. She's 10 years older than me but we got along super well. I stayed at her house when she had her babies, watched her kids and pets, had a house key, all the things. It was a bit of a one-sided friendship (I always drove out an hour to her, made the plans, etc) but again I don't have kids or a pet to watch or anything. Sarah was always outspoken and loud, I was the quiet one, but we got along really well and had a lot of good times together. We worked together on the same floor and worked together very well, I always covered for her when she had to leave early/come late, was up all night with her kids, or had to leave early. She wasn't super loved in our office because she could be a little mean and have some anger issues (would sometimes blow up and yell at people), at times but she was generally liked.

3 years ago, our boss left and Sarah applied. She didn't get it; and tried 2 more times before she was finally hired on as the team lead (a step below the boss). I was thrilled for her, but the day after she got the job, she gave me the silent treatment. That went on for almost 6 months. I asked her multiple times what was going on and she just told me ""nothing"" or even laughed at me that I ""care way too much"". I know our relationship would change after she got the role but I didn't expect this. I never asked for any special treatment. I first brushed it off thinking she was just stressed with the new job and her kids or something but it has been constant.

After the silent treatment blew over, she became incredibly critical of me and my work, when I was the person she would always go to for help or to bounce questions off of. Others noticed how she was treating me but everyone was afraid to say anything. I just kept quiet until she crossed the line way too far one day and went to her boss, who told me she didn't notice anything and to just talk to her (lol).

The past year has gotten better but she still has her moments where she is rude or just mean to me. I let it slide to keep the peace but I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me. We had a new girl start last year, Katie, and this girl is incredibly mean and manipulative. She's gotten many people out of their roles because she wants them, loves tattling on people (over very minute things, not anything important). Sarah has become very close with her and has given her special treatment (remote days, ""special"" tasks, better schedules""). Katie has recently became focused on me and is always watching me, making rude comments, and even baked me treats that ""accidentally"" had something in there that I was allergic to that she clarified before she made them (I didn't eat them, obviously). Katie crossed the line the earlier this week when she took over one of my patients because she felt she knew them better. I tried talking to her and she ignored me, I went to Sarah over it and she just laughed at me and said to talk to her (even though I did). Later that day, my coworker saw Sarah and Katie getting coffee and cracking up together.

How would you handle this? I'm incredibly hurt over everything, I've tried to let it go but this new girl is also crossing the line and making it worse. I don't want to be friend with either of them but I would just like a neutral, respectful relationship. What would you do? HR is useless so I don't want to go that route.

TL;DR: Work friend turned into boss and has been very difficult sine then. New girl that she is now friends with is making my job more difficult and I don't know how to handle either of them.",3,1759006952.0,careeradvice,8,0.8,False

Comecei a me aventurar no mundo dos cafés há pouco mais de 2 meses. Nesse meio tempo li sobre blooming, filtros, chaleiras, grãos, água, temperatura e estou anotando as proporções e variações para entender melhor o que mais me agrada e onde posso melhorar.

Desde então passei a procurar testar diferentes cafés, ainda moídos, pois não adquiri um moedor (estou entre o Timemore C2, Blade R3 e o K6).

Sobre o motivo do post, eu comprei os blends da Um Coffee, Fruit Bomb e Sweetheart, e reparei que eles estão com um aroma super agradável depois de prontos, mas o gosto está amargo e queria algum direcionamento do que fazer.  
  
Testei as proporções com as seguintes temperaturas: 90º, 91º, 93º e 96º e a média de tempo de extração delas é 3:00 para ratio 1:15 e 4:30 para ratio 1:16, mesmo variando a temperatura, o tempo fica bem próximo dessa média.

Já testei o método Kasuya, James Hoffmann e o método do site (em blooming + 2 ataques) e em ambos a extração demora MUITO e o gosto fica totalmente desconexo do aroma.

Por enquanto estou usando isso aqui:  
\- Chaleira Pro Home Style  
\- Balança digital com timer  
\- Água Lindoya / Minalba / Prata (Testei com as 3 e o amargor é super próximo para todas)  
\- Hario V60 de plástico  
\- Filtro Hario V60 - Fazendo uma pequena dobra sobressalente ao pontilhado perto do topo do filtro de papel

Se alguém tiver alguma ideia do que posso fazer nos meus testes, agradeço demais (eu entendo que tenho que comprar um moedor asap)",2,1759006897.0,cafebrasil,3,1.0,False

1ns67qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ns67qb/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1ns5yw5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ns5yw5,A Viking’s Homestead,"I recently finished a small dark ages house for my Norse/Arthurian DnD campaign, inspired by the Ribe house type. I also wanted to try my hand at a few new approaches:

- using twine string to create the thatched roof
- using spackle to make the plaster
- creating a playable interior

All while trying to fit the model to my grasslands terrain tiles with static grass (ie avoiding the ‘floating’ effect).

1ns5yu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1ns5yu2/i_dont_find_my_place_in_the_witchcraft_community/,I don't find my place in the witchcraft community,"Hi... I really feel like I am not finding my place in the community. 

I came to witchcraft wishing to make it different. I wanted to make it be more like... Secret magical mechanics in between walls, markets of magic tucked away in far away spots, villages of witches with nice little trains connecting them, with inns and pubs and coffee shops that serve drinks alongside cats wandering around, aromatic candles and brooms that move around and clean on their own. I believed and still do that everything is possible if you find the right way to do it. 

But what I got was... Dissapointing. I do not want to offend anyone and believe you are wonderful people but up until now I only found pagans, Wiccans, and people who are unwilling to change no nothing. People stuck in the same patterns. I mean, why are we not trying to invent new magic? Why not make an ointment to keep away intruders? Why not make a potion to keep rats out? Why are only burning plants and giving, honestly, pretty random meanings to gems and plants? Is this really all there is to it? I hope not! 

Guys, if anyone else feels the same. Please tell me. I want to make it possible for people who have the same mindset to be more seen. ",0,1759006203.0,witchcraft,25,0.31,False

After my morning dose on Friday morning I started feeling weepy amd just ""off"". I did not take another dose at noon. 

Today is Saturday and my doctor and I agreed that I would only take Adderall during the week as it's affecting my job and not life at home. I know not to drink coffee while on adderall but I went to get coffee today and after about a quarter of it I started feeling light head and slightly dizzy. It's now mid-afternoon and I still feel a little bit funny.

I'm considering stopping any further dosing and asking the doctor to just up my effexor in lieu of stimulants.

Is this something that I should try to push through? 

I have to say I don't think I actually noticed a difference on 5 mg twice a day. If I wouldn't have started feeling funny I was going to start 10 mg twice a day like the doctor and I had initially talked about. But now that I'm feeling funny and weepy an overall off, I'm reconsidering. I just don't know what to do.

Summary:  

Twenty years ago, Aziraphale and Crowley met as teenagers while visiting Rome. They instantly formed the kind of horny, smitten bond neither would ever forget. They lost touch and haven't seen each other since that summer. When Crowley applies to work in Aziraphale's coffee shop after leaving his job as an architect, they're both full of doubt. Neither wants to ask if the other remembers, let alone admit their feelings. After all, who would still be in love with someone they met two decades ago? They turn, instead, to writing down their feelings.  
But would they be brave enough to actually confess them instead of keeping them to themselves?  
How will our heroes cope?

1ns5o90,https://i.redd.it/pyr4lpsbqrrf1.png,A Canadian in All 50 States: A Reflective Odyssey Completed,"# A Canadian in All 50 States: A Reflective Odyssey

Last week in Oahu, I rented a moped — not a WRX, not a Mustang — because that fit better with the island vibe. And with that ride along the Pacific, I closed the circle: I’ve now driven in **all 50 U.S. states**. Back story [HERE](https://www.planksip.org/a-canadian-in-all-50-states-a-reflective-odyssey)

But don’t mistake this for a polished bucket-list achievement. This wasn’t corporate, it wasn’t curated. It started when I was 21, a broke Canadian with a beat-up 1978 Toyota Corolla 5-speed and a bad habit of climbing fences.

# Dollywood at 2 a.m.

In Tennessee, my buddy and I scaled the fence at Dollywood in the dead of night. Security lights blazed, alarms went off, and we dove into one of those ball pits — yes, the plastic ones meant for kids. We lay there, holding our breath, buried in a sea of red, yellow, and blue, waiting half an hour for the guards to give up. That’s one way to see America.

# Atlantic City at Dawn

Another time, we ended up on the helicopter pad of Trump’s Atlantic City casino. I’ll never forget the little booth up there — steaming cup of coffee, half-eaten donut — a guard was just around the corner. We bolted across the pad with the ocean wind in our hair, laughing like idiots, sure we’d get caught. But we didn’t.

# 24,000 Miles in a Corolla

We washed windows at gas stations to scrape together cash. We slept in the Corolla at rest areas, steering wheel for a pillow, shivering through nights in states we couldn’t afford motels in. Over 24,000 miles in two and a half months, we zig-zagged across the lower 48. Some stretches blurred together in exhaustion, others burned into memory forever.

Texas felt like an entire country. Maine was all salt air and stoic towns. California highways — beautiful chaos. And yet the road itself was the constant, the hum of tires on asphalt the soundtrack to our lives.

# Hawaii: The Final Boss

So when I rolled out on that little Oahu moped last week, it wasn’t about luxury or status. It was about completion. Hawaii was the last piece, the “final boss.” And fittingly, it wasn’t conquered in some muscle car fantasy but in flip-flops, buzzing along the coast, laughing at how far the road had carried me from that Corolla at 21.

# Why It Mattered

Driving all 50 states wasn’t about seeing them. It was about **surviving them**. About getting chased, getting lost, and getting found. About turning America into a mirror — one that reflected back a kid who wanted stories more than comfort.

And I got them. Every damn mile.

As someone who spends a lot of time testing out home essentials, I’ve had the pleasure of diving into the Amazon Basics 1038354 Water Pitcher, specifically the Amazon Basics 10-Cup Water Pitcher with Filter. My experience with Brita-compatible water pitchers has been varied, but this one caught my attention for several reasons. Allow me to share my in-depth review based on real-life use over several weeks. Spoiler alert: it’s a well-rounded contender, but it isn’t without a few quirks.

**Smart Design for Modern Kitchens**

The compact and ergonomic design of this pitcher stood out immediately. Unlike those bulky filtration systems that hog fridge space, this pitcher’s streamlined structure fits perfectly on fridge shelves. Its dimensions—9.84""L x 5.7""W x 10.04""H—make it incredibly fridge-friendly without sacrificing the 10-cup capacity. It easily fills up multiple reusable water bottles, which is a must for my busy days on the go. Even the handle feels comfortable to grip during those early mornings when I’m still half-asleep and fumbling for a glass.

Secure Lid Technology is another thoughtful touch. I’ve had my fair share of “oops” moments with other pitchers leaking water during pouring, but this lid ensures nothing spills when tipped, even when kids attempt to pour their own water. That peace of mind alone is worth a lot.

**Multi-Stage Filtration for Crisp Tasting Water**

The water quality from this thing? Amazing. I must admit, I was skeptical when the product’s description claimed to reduce contaminants like chlorine, copper, mercury, and benzene while also improving taste. After the first couple of uses, I could absolutely taste the difference. Compared to tap water, which often carries an off-putting sourness, this pitcher delivered clean, refreshing sips every single time. My family noticed it too; even my picky teen, who usually insists on bottled water, started using the pitcher daily.

It’s certified to meet NSF/ANSI Standards 42, 53, and 372, something I tested by brewing coffee and tea with filtered water. Both drinks had cleaner, more neutral flavors—free from any chemical aftertastes. The included electronic MEMO reminds me when a filter change is needed, and since the filter lasts up to 40 gallons (around two months for my household), maintaining it doesn’t feel like a chore.  

**Check [Amazon Basics 1038354] price on Amazon.**

**Easy to Handle and Operate**

This water pitcher runs purely on manual power, which means fewer mechanical parts to worry about breaking down. Lifting, refilling, and pouring is straightforward even for younger or older family members. Weighing in at just 2 pounds, it’s light enough that my nephew (bless his tiny hands) can grab it from the fridge without accidentally flooding the kitchen. The filter replacement process is intuitive; no complicated instructions needed. You just pop the new Brita-compatible filter in, and you’re set. 

What’s even cooler is how you can pair it with Brita filters. If you’ve already got spare Brita replacements lying around, they work seamlessly with this pitcher. It’s a simple, versatile feature that saved me money and made transitioning over to this pitcher completely hassle-free.

**Highlights**

- Seamlessly fits in most standard refrigerators and saves space.  
- Secure Lid Technology prevents those dreaded leaks.  
- Certified filtration removes harmful contaminants while improving taste.  

**Potential Shortcomings**

- The electronic MEMO is handy but could use better display visibility in low light.  
- The lid, although secure, can be tricky to snap on properly the first time.  
- If you’re not careful, the pouring spout design may sometimes trap a drop or two post-pour and cause minor drips.  

**Competitive Options**

Now, how does this water pitcher stack up against industry giants like Brita and ZeroWater? In terms of design and capacity, it performs impressively—matching Brita pitchers in fridge compatibility while edging out ZeroWater in weight and ease of handling. Brita, however, still wins when it comes to brand recognition and slight improvements in filter lifespans (depending on your chosen model). On the other hand, I found the Amazon Basics pitcher integrated seamlessly with Brita filters, saving some bucks on new filter purchases. ZeroWater excels in advanced purification but tends to cost more, and honestly, the added weight of their models can be a hassle.

The Amazon Basics pitcher does have room to improve in terms of tech. While an electronic MEMO is nice, a more customizable or app-integrated tracking system, like what some competitors offer, would be a game-changer. Still, if simplicity and affordability matter more, this product puts up a strong fight in the water filter showdown.

**Affordable Quality**

Let’s talk about value. This product doesn’t claim to be the ultimate premium water filter pitcher on the market, but it delivers where it counts. It’s reasonably priced, especially when you factor in the savings from being able to use Brita-compatible filters. For anyone looking for an effective, space-efficient, and no-nonsense solution to enjoy purified water, it’s well worth investing in this pitcher. Personally, I’d call it a smart middle-ground option—solid filtration at a wallet-friendly cost.

Thanks to all of you for your inspiration and guidance!  This base recipe has worked very well for me over the last 5 batches or so with vanilla paste and coffee as the two different kinds of ice cream I’ve tried.  I’m sure you can flavor this as needed.  It yields an ice cream that is exceptionally smooth, has a nice amount of “chew,” (for my taste, anyway), requires only one cycle on the Ice Cream cycle followed by a freeze to firm up and remains scoopable if you don’t use it up immediately.  You might eat it all, though, because it’s delicious!  Anyway…

Ingredients for two Original Creami containers, 1400g

* Milk	700g
* Cream	500g
* Skim Milk Powder	55g
* Sucrose	95g
* Glycerin 	30g
* Glucose Syrup	18g
* Xanthan	.5g
* Guar .5g
* Salt	1g

1.  In a medium bowl, combine the Milk Powder, Sugar, Salt and gums.  Whisk until well combined.

2. Put the Glucose syrup and glycerin in a medium saucepan, then whisk in the milk while heating over medium low heat.  

3. Once the milk has warmed slightly, add the dry ingredient mixture to the milk.  

4. Control the heat so the milk doesn’t boil or scorch.  The goal is to hold the milk at this sub-boil for about 25 minutes.  Remove the pan from heat, if you must and keep a close eye on the proceedings.

5.  After 25 minutes of heating, turn off the heat.  Whisk the cream in slowly. 

6. Let the mixture cool.  If you are really a stickler, use an ice bath to cool it down real quick.  

7.  Once cool, pour in to two Original Creami containers.

8.  Flavor as desired.  Or don’t for an amazing Sweet Cream!  To the first container, I added 2 tbs Espresso Powder and 30g Fresh coffee beans.  This one, I refrigerated for 24 hours then strained out, then returned it to the container, gave it a good stir and froze it 24 hours.  The other one I put a teaspoon of Vanilla Extract and about a Tbsp of Vanilla Bean paste, then the fridge for 24 hours, then stirred it up, then the freezer for 24 hours.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2023""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it""? I inquired.

The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man.

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.

Over the past few years, I have made the joke that he doesn’t know me. Like moments when I ask if he knew my (commonly used) reference I just made was from my favorite TV show, or which dessert item off of a small menu I would prefer. The past few months it has gotten out of hand. He has ADHD and dyslexia and uses those diagnoses as reasons for mixing up words, misremembering stories, or just out right forgetting details about me or his family. He will even out himself. He knows I have an important interview coming up and I gave him a mock speech I will need to have memorized. A few days later we’re just sitting in silence he asks “do you know what you’re going to write your speech about?” Like I didn’t just give him a whole run down. Or when I did ask a question of which movie I binge watched in college (a tidbit I’ve shared multiple times), he said the right one, and when I continued on with my story, he just threw out a second title of a movie I was JUST telling his family that I haven’t ever really seen. He’s the same way with his own family. He’ll forget birthdays or pick presents that are very base level (think of a tie for Father’s Day). For every Christmas, anniversary, Valentine’s Day, and birthday I always say I’d rather have an experience than a gift that’ll just collect dust (he has lots of figurines of his interests in our apartment and I more so have framed family photos). While he’ll continue to collect trading cards and figurines, I haven’t received any gift in two years. Well, I want experiences right? I send him reels of places I’d like to visit or restaurants/coffee shops I want to try and he’ll say we’ll go but unless I specifically make a plan, we have never gone. We never really do anything unless I am the one who outright plans it. Including vacations. I will choose a few activities including things I know he’d prefer, then book a hotel near that area bc I’m the one making the plans. 

With all of this said, I know he’s a kind person. There is not a hateful bone in his body. He’s honest and helpful. Everyone who knows him knows how sweet he is. He washes my straws by hand, cleans my hair from the drain, settles me when I become anxious, cooks more than me, and does a majority of the laundry. But lately the helpfulness hasn’t been the THOUGHFULness I’ve been needing. He’s finally going to therapy about his confidence and becoming a better listener, but I haven’t seen any progress. I’ll still tell him what I’d like to do and instead we do nothing. I’ll get him gifts and plan outings he’ll love, but I don’t think he sees more than a few hours into the future. That’s why he’s great at dinners and laundry, but we’ve never been on a date or trip he’s planned. He hasn’t given me gifts in two years but gets himself cute stuff. He says he has trouble remembering my interests so he needs to right them down, but he can list everything about over 1000 Pokémon and 1100 episodes of One Piece. 

He claims he wants to change. Can a 31 year old change in this way? Does anyone have any success stories of a helpful partner becoming a thoughtful partner? He seems like he’s in this NPC loop that restarts every day. Can this change? To be known is to be loved and I feel so unknown. ",2,1759004544.0,relationshipadvice,11,0.75,False

1ns59da,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1ns59da/a_year_ago_i_quit_my_dream_job_heres_what_eating/,"A year ago, I quit my 'dream job.' Here's what eating instant noodles in my boxers for 6 months taught me.","I used to have what everyone called a 'dream job.' Great salary, benefits, a fancy title on LinkedIn... the whole package. But my reality was a beige cubicle under buzzing fluorescent lights, pretending to look busy in endless meetings, and living for the weekend. The highlight of my day was the stale coffee. The thought of doing that for another 30 years felt like a prison sentence. So, I did the crazy thing. I saved up every penny, wrote a resignation letter with a shaking hand, and walked out with a cardboard box of my sad desk plants, feeling a terrifying mix of exhilaration and pure panic.

The first six months were, to put it mildly, brutal. My grand vision of being a cool, coffee-shop-hopping entrepreneur immediately evaporated. My reality was my cramped apartment, 16-hour days fueled by cheap instant noodles, and a bank account that was bleeding out way faster than I expected. I pitched to dozens of potential clients and got ghosted or rejected every single time. The loneliness was crushing. My friends were getting promotions and going on vacation, while I was arguing with my laptop at 2 AM. There was a moment, staring at an overdue rent notice, where I almost crawled back to my old boss.

Then, one Tuesday, it happened. A 'yes.' It wasn't a massive, life-changing contract, but it was a real client who believed in my work. I remember staring at the email, reading it over and over again, just to make sure it was real. That one 'yes' was the crack of light I needed. It gave me the confidence to refine my pitch and chase bigger leads. A few weeks later, I landed a second client, and then a third. The momentum started to build, slowly at first, then all at once.

Now, a year later, I'm writing this from a cafe in a city I'm visiting just because I felt like it. I work fewer hours, make more money, and actually feel proud of what I'm building. It's still hard, and the stress is different—it's all on me now—but it's a good kind of stress. It’s the stress of creation, not the stress of a slow death by PowerPoint presentations. It was the hardest, scariest, and most ridiculously rewarding thing I have ever done.

So, for anyone out there on the edge of making a similar leap, what’s the one fear that’s *really* holding you back?",1,1759004443.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1ns5724,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1ns5724/whats_new_in_coffee_grinder_technology/,What's new in coffee grinder technology?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been obsessing over coffee grinders lately, and I thought I'd share some exciting developments I've discovered in the world of coffee grinding technology. As someone who's gone through countless grinders over the years, I'm genuinely amazed at how far we've come.

First off, the precision in modern coffee grinders is mind-blowing. Remember when we used to guess the grind size? Now, we've got grinders with digital displays showing exact micron measurements. It's like going from a flip phone to a smartphone – the difference is that dramatic.

I recently picked up a new burr grinder (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), and the consistency is incredible. We're talking uniform particles that would make a scientist proud. This matters because uneven grounds can mess up your entire brew, giving you both bitter and sour notes in the same cup – nobody wants that!

The noise reduction technology is another game-changer. My old grinder used to wake up the entire house, but newer models have smart sound-dampening features. Some even have anti-static technology, so your grounds don't stick everywhere like they used to.

Temperature control is becoming a big deal too. Heat can seriously affect coffee oils and flavors, so manufacturers are developing ways to keep things cool during grinding. Some high-end models even have built-in cooling systems.

Smart features are also trending. There are grinders now that connect to your phone, remember your preferred settings, and can even adjust grind size based on the beans you're using. While I was researching options (here's that helpful link again: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), I found models that can automatically weigh your beans and adjust grinding time for the perfect dose.

The durability factor has improved too. Modern burrs are often made with harder materials that stay sharp longer. Some manufacturers are even using diamond-like carbon coatings – pretty wild, right?

For those interested in sustainability, there are now more eco-friendly options available. Think recyclable parts, energy-efficient motors, and even models made from sustainable materials.

What really gets me excited is how accessible these technologies are becoming. You don't need to spend a fortune anymore to get a quality grinder with advanced features. The market's competitive, and that's driving innovation while keeping prices reasonable.

My personal favorite development is the hybrid grinder designs that combine different grinding mechanisms for specific brew methods. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for coffee grinding.

Whether you're a coffee nerd like me or just someone who enjoys a good cup, these advances in grinding technology are making it easier than ever to brew amazing coffee at home. The precision and consistency you can achieve now were unthinkable just a few years ago.

I'd love to hear what features you're most excited about in modern coffee grinders. Drop your thoughts in the comments!",1,1759004281.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Target is also offering a free year of their 360 membership on the app and you get a freebie with the membership. for September I got a $10 off when you spend $10 on good and gather groceries, so I only had to pay about $2 total. It's not ALL good and gather groceries though. there are other deals like a free coffee item, but that was gone by the time i signed up.

You can make multiple mcdonalds accounts but i would space them out, and get a free big mac with purchase, one cookie is $1.19, if you don't want sweets you can get apple slices + any side sauce and that adds up to $1. Works for getting the free fries on friday as well. If you mobile order on the big mac order, it gives you 1500 points as well and they've added new items like coffee and breakfast freebies.

I know these aren't technically 100% free but I figure most people have $1 in change laying around, so I hope this helps.

All of my decants are glass - no plastic. Color options for caps 5 and 15ml which I try to match to the fragrence or bottle. Majority are gold, black, and silver, but let me know if you have specific requests. 15ml decants actually hold 17ml to the neck. If you want 17ml just let me know and multiply the price by 1.13. Sepereate syringes used for each fragrance so no cross contamination.
